HAN 15 No. XXX. QUARTERLY SUMMARY OF THE SICKNESS AND MORTALITY IN THE PARISH OF Saint George, Hanober Square, AND OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE MEDICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH, FOR THE QUARTER ENDED 1st APRIL, 1865, WITH REPORT OF THE YEAR. Eontron: PRINTED BY OEORGE PHIPPS, UPPER RANELAOH STREET, PIMLICO, S.W. TO THE Vestry of St. George, Hanober Square. My Lords and Gentlemen, Our Table of Mortality for this quarter is a very heavy one. No fewer than 607 deaths were registered, including those of 70 strangers in St. George's Hospital, and 6 inmates of the Little Chelsea Workhouse. But although it was the winter quarter, and a cold one, it does not appear that the excess of mortality arose from the disorders which are commonly attributed to cold,—for instance, those of the lungs; but rather to an intensity of every possible cause of death. Thus in the first quarter of the year— Tot*l dea'hs. Deaths under 5. )ver 60. From zymotic disease. From lung disease and phthisis. Deaths at home in H an over and May fair. In Belgrave. 1857 436 161 115 74 151 1S7 206 1858 528 224 106 110 195 163 251 1859 457 203 100 85 140 116 235 1860 547 245 118 80 199 140 288 1861 540 213 146 74 201 133 273 1862 609 288 123 116 183 129 358 1863 553 256 110 136 140 140 298 1864 604 207 178 75 214 169 300 1865 607 234 154 97 189 187 297 Last year, during this quarter, the diminished mortality of the young, and the less fatality of zymotic disease, were remarkable; this quarter, every cause of death seems evenly 4 distributed, and the Hanover and May-fair have suffered out of proportion to the Belgrave Sub-Districts. The deaths from measles were confined to the Belgrave Sub-District, where there were four. One of the patients had chicken-pox as well. One single case appears in the death or sickness rolls of the Hanover and May-fair for this quarter. These diseases come in great waves, and then vanish. At the moment of writing (May 1865) the latter Sub-Districts are full of measles. The deaths from scarlatina were 17, with which we group 10 from diphtheria and 8 from croup (although the last seems to belong to a different order of disease,—a severe inflammation of the windpipe produced by cold, affecting young children almost exclusively, and not contagious; whereas diphtheria seems produced by some definite poison, affects persons of any age, is contagious, and may begin anywhere in the throat, not the windpipe; still, in some cases, it is difficult to decide between the two). Of the scarlatina, 1 death occurred in Oxford-street, 1 in Hertford-place, Mayfair, 1 (complicated with diphtheria) at No. — Brick-street, an old thickly inhabited house, which, with all care, we never can keep free from disease. Thirteen cases were distributed over Colchester and Rutland-streets, Belgrave-terrace, Lower Belgrave-place, Wilton-place, and Pembroke-place. There were 2 in one house in Ebury-square, 2 in Pembroke-mews, 3 in Hindon-street, one of these last complicatedwith mumps. Of the diphtheria, deaths occurred in Lower Brook-street, also in some very clean stables in Market-street, in Chapelstreet, in Lancashire-court and John's-court; also in Cornwall, Coleshill and Caroline-streets and Ranelagh-road. Whooping-cough destroyed 16 children, pretty evenly distributed all over the parish; but this of all other diseases is the one of which we know least, and can interfere with least. 5 The 24 deaths from fever are a high figure, still there is nothing alarming in them when analyzed. We may observe that these cases include, first, those commonly called typhoid, which are proved to be due to severe emanations chiefly. Second, the true typhus, the fever of filthy, over-crowded, half-starved populations. This is intensely contagious, and spreads anywhere; but it is the most readily controlled by proper measures, and, we are thankful to say, is almost unknown amongst us. Third, there is a great variety of cases of all sorts, which look like fever, which have more or less feverishness, exhaustion, &c., but which maybe due to almost any disease exhaustion fatigue or cold acting on a broken down constitution. It is said to be a common thing with some practitioners to say that a man has "fever," or dies with "typhoid symptoms," when the cause is really unknown. Hence, we need not assume that every case entered as "fever" is a true contagious case, arising from neglect of sanitary precaution. The cases that occurred this quarter were none in the Hanover, 3 in the May-fair; 2 of elderly gentlemen, and 1 of an infant; 8 in the Belgrave, in Whittaker and Aylesford streets, Hugh-street West, Warwick-street, and Howick-terrace. In this last case low fever was associated with diphtheria. In St. George's Hospital died 1 nurse, 1 woman of 58 from Grosvenor-place, Grosvenor-row, and 6 persons chiefly from Chelsea, Battersea, and Hammersmith. Passing over the other cases of epidemic disease as showing no conspicuous features, we observe that no fewer than 152 lives were lost, under circumstances indicative of debility and degeneration; as scrofula, consumption, water in the head, convulsions, premature birth, malformations, teething, and atrophy and debility. Thirty-one also died of old age. The deaths from accident were very numerous. A rare case is that of a boy, aged 14, in Churton-place, who died in five days of the effects of fright. A painter fell from a 6 board in Hill-street; a plasterer fell from a ladder; two men fell from carts they were driving; a man walking on a mound by the side of a road at Battersea, fell under the wheels of a cart, suffered amputation of his leg in St. George's Hospital, and died of pyaemia afterwards; a maidservant, aged 23, fell down stairs by treading on her dress, broke her arm, had it cut off in St. George's Hospital, and also died of pyaemia; a workman fell into a tub at Smith's distillery, and was crushed by the screw. Three men died of railway accidents, two of them young porters, of 22 or 23, from slipping in the snow under the wheels. One of these died of pysemia after amputation. A man also died of fracture of the thigh, who was picked up in the road at Battersea, and did not know how the injury had happened. A boy ruptured his liver by running against a Hansom cab. No fewer than 9 deaths took place from burns and scalds; 4 of children from 3 to 5 years of age, and 1 of awoman of 75, whose clothes "ignited accidentally," usually from a fire in a grate; a boy of 13, and a woman of 54, fell into the fire, and were burned to death whilst helpless from paralysis, or unconscious from epilepsy: this being one of the horrible dangers of that last horrible disease; and 3 children scalded by the upsetting of saucepans, one of whom suffered from an internal inflammation, such as often follows burns and scalds. The term pyaemia denotes a kind of infection of the blood liable to affect injured persons in unhealthy seasons, especially in Hospitals. It not only carried off some of the patients above named, but 4 patients who underwent operations for disease. One man was drowned by the upsetting of a boat, and a boy from falling into the water whilst he was fishing out sticks. An infant was found suffocated in bed with its parents. Of suicides there were 5: 1 by drowning, 2 by wounds, and 1 by both methods combined; 1 man by oxalic 7 acid. Six newly born infants—probably still-born—at all events with no evidence how they came by their deaths, were cast away on a dung heap in Ebury-mews, on the embankment of the Grosvenor Canal, in Hyde-park, and the Serpentine. One besides was found, which the Coroner's jury declared to have been suffocated, no evidence how. All these things are marks of our whole social condition, and we may depend on it, that the houses of people who would cast out a dead infant as they do a dog, are a good deal in want of Inspectors of Nuisances, moral and physical. sickness in the iianover and may-fair sub-districts. The number of persons treated during the quarter by the Medical Officers of the Parish, and of the Dispensary, Mountstreet, and in the Sick-Wards of the Workhouse, Mountstreet, was 991. Amongst these were 9 cases of small-pox, 10 chicken-pox, 1 measles, 20 scarlatina, 19 whooping-cough, 10 diarrhoea, 2 erysipelas, 18 fever, 218 bronchitis, 7 diphtheria, and 1 pleurisy. The 19 cases of scarlatina were distributed thus: 1 in Brick-street, fatal; 3 in one house in Hertford-place, 1 fatal; in Grosvenor and South Molton-mews, Hanover-place, Brownstreet, &c. The 7 cases of diphtheria, in a knot of old houses in Brick-street, in Grosvenor-mews, Swan's-passage, and Hertford-place; 1 of the 7 was fatal. The 1 case of measles was combined with whooping-cough,—a child at 30a, Grosvenor-mews. Of the 18 cases of fever, 12 were treated in the Sick Wards: 1 was sent from May's-buildings to the Fever Hospital, and soon came home well; the others were scattered over Weaver's-place, some old houses at the top of Clarges-street, Hart-street, Bell-yard, &c. At all 8 events, the deaths from fever did not occur in houses subject to our regular explorations. The Sick-Wards at Mount-street, and the Book of Admissions to the Fever Hospital, show how much our Parish has contributed to the typhus epidemic in London, and it is not much. One girl was sent, as aforesaid, to the Fever Hospital with typhoid; an old man from Whittakerstreet with typhus. Six tramps, and 1 woman from 8, Clifford'srow, were admitted into the Sick-Wards, where, unluckily, 1 nurse and 2 other inmates took the infection and died. the small-pox. There, was an outbreak of this disease in the Hanover Sub-District, which assumed the proportions of a petty epidemic. On the 10th January, an infant of 7 months, not vaccinated, died of it at 17, Brown-street. On the 24th, W. S., a man aged 36, vaccinated, was sent from the same house to the Small-pox Hospital; next week a girl named Elizabeth Cooper, aged 15, from 36, Thomas-street, was also sent there: she had been vaccinated when young by a celebrated vaccinator. At the same time, 3 children, at 18, Brown-street, named 2 aged 7 and 14, vaccinated young, 1 aged 4, not vaccinated, born in Marylebone. On February 15, an infant 10 weeks old died, at 15, Robert-street, also unvaccinated. At the beginning of March, Susan and Esther M., of 3, Brown-street, aged 11 and 14, both vaccinated. Also at 7, Thomas-street, Sarah T., aged 4, Elizabeth, set. 10, and Charlotte, set. 13, all vaccinated. At the same time, Margaret M., set. 18, and Eliza, Eet. 13, vaccinated, at 3, Shepherd's-market. These cases bring up the number known to have occurred in the Hanover and May-fair Sub-Districts, since December 1842 to 156. 9 sickness in the belgkave sub-distkict. In the Belgrave Sub-District 8,208 persons were treated by the parochial surgeons, and at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St. Paul and St. Barnabas' Dispensary, and at the Workhouse, Little Chelsea. Of these 4,914 were patients-at St. George's Hospital, leaving a remainder of 3,294. The total figures include 8 of small-pox, 12 of chickenpox, 3 of measles, 26 of scarlet fever, 8 of whooping-cough, 76 of diarrhoea, 5 of dysentery, 45 of continued fever, 27 of rheumatic fever, 12 of erysipelas, 4 of diphtheria, and 3 of carbuncle. There were 781 cases of bronchitis, 9 of pleurisy, and 21 of pneumonia. The following are the particulars of the cases of smallpox, namely,— At No. 29, Pulford-street—Leahin, set. 13, vaccinated. At No. 1, Ranelagh-grove—Alice Lucas, set. 20, vaccinated ; sent to the Small Pox Hospital 18th January, 1865. At No. 11, Effingham-street—a boy, set. 14, unvaccinated. At No. 14, Flask-lane—Wells, set. 4 months. At No. 12, Princes-row—Elizabeth Jobbing, set. 3, unvaccinated. At No- 1, Elizabeth-place—Alice Dickson, set. 12, vaccinated. At No. 5, Cutmore-buildings—Lydia Allen, set. 2, unvaccinated. At No. 4, Gregory-street—a female, vaccinated. There were also sent to the Small Pox Hospital a man, aged 37, from 1, Elizabeth-place on 30th January, G. C., set. 24, on 24th January, and Emily S., set. 32, on 23rd. C. J. B. ALDIS, M.D. R.

No. HI. special cases. (1) The case of nuisance at the new University Club, St. James's-street, is sufficiently remarkable to merit description. This house and the next had long been annoyed by a foul smell, which led the occupiers to seek the aid of the Inspector. After some search, it was discovered that the outer and inner measurement of the premises did not agree; and on removing the paper from a part of the wall, an old door was discovered, which, when broken open, disclosed an old disused privy, with cesspool under it. This cesspool, which 13 formerly received the sewage of both houses, was 16 ft. 6 in. deep, 6 ft. 6 in. long, and 4 ft. 6 in. wide, and contained 10 cart-loads of soil. These were carted off, and the cavity filled with dry brick rubbish; the old saturated brickwork in the neighbourhood was also cut away and replaced by new; and here we may mention, as a practical fact, that brickwork once saturated with urine or sewage seems incurable. Stink and sweat it will; and the only remedy is to cut it away and build it afresh. In this case the remarkable ignorance and carelessness of workmen are well shown. An old cesspool left to save the trouble of removing it: a door papered up to hide it! The long number of years during which these houses were occupied as an hotel, and the degree to which the inmates must have suffered from stench is noticeable enough; and, as a crowning fact, it must be said that this old cesspool still received the overflow-pipe from a closet in a house in Bennett-street, which kept its contents wet and stirred up, and which doubtless acted as a channel for the conveyance of gases into this house also. (2) Oxford-street.—A new house had been built, and the owner neglected to provide gutters and pipes for carrying away the rain-water. Hence it came down in floods upon the houses on either side, making certain rooms very damp. The owner was told that he would be summoned if the nuisance were not abated. (3) A new kind of nuisance consists in slacking lime in an unceilinged cellar below an inhabited room, so that the hot fumes and steam go up through the chinks of the boards. (4) Three houses in Curzon-street, poisoned by three cesspools, which received the greater part of their sewage, and leaked over into cellars of Messrs. East. An enormous amount of sewage must have soaked into the earth during the last century; and huge volumes of foetid gases into the houses. 14 (5) The case of two contiguous first-class houses in Grosvenor-street, each suffering more or less from sewer vapour. These houses, which we will call for distinction sake x and y, were the subject of inquiry in January 1864, when it was discovered that an old dead drain had been left under x, after the fatal and most reprehensible custom of workmen and a small cesspool in the vault of y. These were done away with, and a soil pipe in y was better trapped and repaired, and it was hoped the case was at end. But 14 months later, fresh complaints were made by the occupants of x, and these led to a further inquiry, at which we examined the whole of each house, and also had the opportunity of taking such evidence as was tendered by the builders who had built, and had since repaired these houses: for sad to say, they are both newly built, and we are not now dealing with the misdeeds of the last generation. Each house has great depth from back to front. The water-closets are in the middle of each house, and drained by a soil-pipe which passes down within the party wall. Instead of being made of lead, and being embedded in a groove covered by a panel, so that they could be got at and repaired if need be; these pipes are mere cast iron rain-water pipes, with loose joints, and embedded in the brickwork, so that they could not be got at without cutting away the wall, and spoiling the decorations of the house. This being the case, the inhabitants of x complained of drain effluvia which they believed to proceed from the soil-pipe of y, embedded in the party wall. Whether this were the case or not, we could not say, for the soil-pipe of each house being similar, there was as much probability as not that x's complaint arose within its own wall. Before advising the Sanitary Committee to call on y to pull down his pipe and deface his house, we thought that x should do the same; but as he declined, there the matter rested. 15 (6) Swat low-place.—This was a case like that of Steele'scourt. A small sewer receiving the drainage of 6 houses was obstructed by deposit, and the sewage leaked up into the coal cellars of the lower houses. (7) Communication of disease to patients in Hospitals.— The following is a case which involves a most important principle. A boy named Thomas P., aged 8, went with his brother from 18, North Bruton-mews, into St. George's Hospital, on the 4th November, for the cure of scalds. On or about the 30th, he became affected with scarlet fever, but recovered sufficiently to leave the Hospital and go home on the 7th. This, be it observed, was much earlier than was quite safe for a scarlet fever patient to go into a house—so called— such as 18, North Bruton-mews, which with the contiguous premises in Grosvenor-mews ought rather to be called a village of 140 people under one roof; nevertheless, as it happened, no infection spread on the present occasion, and it could not have been helped if there had;—for a child cannot be maintained by a private charity, such as St. George's Hospital, till the infectious stage is over. But there was another boy named James M., set. 12, living in Bolton-yard, and acting as page at 13, Duke-street, St. James's, who fell whilst cleaning a window, and broke one arm, and sustained other injuries on November 1st. He was taken to St. George's Hospital, and admitted into the ward contiguous with that in which Thomas P. was, where he went on well till December 7th, when he took the scarlet fever and died on the 28th. This is a different case, and involves the question,—ought patients to be left to take their chance, or ought every precaution to be taken that they shall not catch any complaint in the Hospital other than that for which they were admitted within its walls? The Sanitary Committee of the Yestry took the latter view, and directed one of the Medical Officers of Health to confer 16 with the Secretary of St. George's Hospital on the matter. It was fully admitted that 110 fault was to be found with the cleanliness and ventilation of the wards; the single question was, ought a patient with an infectious disease, to be allowed to remain in a ward with other patients reasonably liable to take it: and it is very gratifying to be able to add, that the Secretary has assured the Medical Officers of Health, that steps will be taken for the future to isolate patients with communicable diseases. This is a most important and benevolent plan. It must be recollected, that St. George's, like other Hospitals supported by voluntary contributions, is not a public but a private institution, the supporters of which are under no compulsion whatever, save such as arises from their own wishes to do good. (8) Livery Yard, 5, Halkin-place, Belgrave-square.— Frequent complaints have been made of the foul smell of dung in this yard, which was inspected on January 9th, 10th, and 11th, 1865, between the hours of 10 a.m. and 5 p.m., when the dung was not removed, although the Inspector of Nuisances had given orders to that effect. As the Sanitary Committee had previously resolved that a summons be taken out if the dung were not properly removed, one was taken out on January 13th, to be heard on January 20th. It was adjourned to the 24th of the same month, no one answering to it when called. Mr. Arnold, the magistrate at the Westminster Police Court, then directed one of the officers to wait on the owner, and request him to appear. His son came instead, and expressed his willingness to remove the dung three times a week, namely, on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, before 10 a.m. Mr. Arnold thinking this sufficient, if properly carried out, discharged the summons on the payment of the costs. (9) No. 6, Eccleston- street, Eaton-square.—A letter was sent in this case, by order of Sir George Grey, to the 17 Vestry, to know if a complaint made was correct: that men employed on the premises slept in an underground vault, contrary to the 4th and oth sections of the Bakehouse Act. A reply was sent to the effect, that the bed room was properly partitioned off from the bakehouse, with a door opening into it, and that it was not an underground vault as complained of in the letter of Sir George Grey. The dimensions of the window opening into an area, which extended the whole length of the house, were stated, but as these were somewhat below the size required by the Act, the Medical Officer recommended the window in the men's sleeping apartment to be made the exact size required by the Act, which has been done. The owner was quite willing to make any necessary alteration. (10) No. 26, Wilton-road.—This was a case of combined drains which were stopped up, and the bakehouse flooded with offensive water. A new nine-inch pipe drain li£^ been laid down through 4, Shaftesbury-terrace, and those of Nos. 3 and 29 in the same Terrace, with that of 26, Wilton-road, connected with it. (11) No. 42, Claverton-street.—In this case, the owner wishing to get rid of a lodger, cut off the water, which of course made the closets most offensive; but he was soon compelled to allow it to go into the cisterns. APPENDIX. No. IV. visitation of bakehouses. The 37 bakehouses in the Hanover and Mayfair Districts were inspected in March, by ourselves in company with Mr. Grant, when one was found shut up; one going B 18 to be rebuilt; 23 were found to require limewashing in compliance with the Bakehouses Regulation Act, which has since been done. Fifty-seven bakehouses were inspected in the Out-Wards on March 17th, 20th and 21st, when 53 of them were found to require limewashing, which has been done. Our attention was called to the extremely limited space and defective ventilation of the journeymen and apprentices' bed room at Messrs S, and although this does not come within the scope of the Bakehouses Regulation Act, we made representations to the firm, which led to its being made of double capacity, and well provided with means of ventilation. APPENDIX. No. V. GAS. Seventy observations were made during the quarter, upon the six gases supplied by the Chartered, London, and Equitable Companies, in the Horseferry-road, Bessborough-street, and Cambridge-street, respectively. The gases were burned in accordance with the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, and the illuminating power continued above the standard light required by the Act. With respect to purity, all the gases were free from sulphuretted hydrogen, and so far free from ammonia, that they did not discolour the turmeric paper, except on February 22nd, when both the gases of the Chartered Company presented traces of ammonia; and on March 10th, the common gas of the London Company showed a similar impurity. 19 The following Table gives the average light in sperm candles of all the gases— Chartered.

Cannel 24.61 22.78 25.76 Common 14.82 14.30 15.08 A Table and Summary were sent with each Monthly Report on the gas to the Vestry, containing the number of examinations and the pressures, with the dates, and the weekly and monthly average illuminating power. 0.

ALDIS, M.D., fj-as Examiner. 20 ANNUAL REPORT, Showing Summary of Births, Deaths, Vaccinations, Sanitary Statistics, and Improvements, for One Year, from April 2nd, 1864, to April 1st, 1865, with Comparative Statement of Seven foregoing Years. Births. The number in the whole parish was 2452. In the years ending March 31st The numbers were In the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts, the births this year wore 709; in the years The numbers were In the Belgrave Sub-District this year there were 1743 Deaths. The gross nuber in the whole parish has been 2015, whereas in the foregoing 7 years they were Gross Death-rate. Estimating the population of the whole parish as 91,500, the gross death-rate was 22 per 1000 living; in 1864 it was 22.4, with a population also estimated at 91,500; 1863,20.9 with an estimated population of 90,000; in 1862 it was 22.2 with an estimated population of 88,500. 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1808 1864 2165 2288 2300 2119 2498 2411 2412 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1868 1864 660 705 710 656 735 661 694 1505 1583 1590 1463 1763 1750 1718 1768 1838 1837 1769 1965 1882 2054 Excess of Births over Deaths, 398 in the whole parish . 397 450 463 350 533 529 358 Estimated Population. This, of course, is the necessary basis of our calculation of the death-rate. At the census of 1851, tho gross population of the parish was 73,230; in 1861 it was 87,747, thus showing a gross increase of the population in 10 years, of 15,000. As we stated in our last Annual Report, the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts maybe regarded as virtually stationary; for there is no fresh ground to build on, and the population even fell in the 10 years 51.61, from 33,464 to 32,686. The increase, therefore, is confined to the Belgrave Sub-District, which we believe to have increased steadily at the rate of 1,500 per annum up to the middle of 1864. This brings up the estimated population 21 from 87,747 in 1861, to 88,500 in round numbers in 1862, and to 90,000 in 1863, and 91,500 in 1864. But in this Sub-District, it is the Out-Ward, or South Belgravia, which has increased by the process of new building. This year the increase seems arrested. This will be evident from the following Table:— Number of Ratings in the Parish of St. George, Hanover Square, in the following years :— 1855 1856 1857 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1863 1864 1865 Dover Ward 833 885 385 379 379 380 391 331 339 339 389 Conduit Ward 618 619 619 614 618 618 618 618 618 613 613 Grosvenor Ward 844 843 842 840 840 839 838 833 833 838 838 Brook Ward 1083 1078 1078 1076 1075 1074 1077 1080 1083 1082 1082 Curzon Ward 712 712 718 712 712 715 725 722 716 716 716 Knightsbridge Ward 24G1 2440 2146 2456 2468 2470 2478 2489 2497 2501 2505 Oat-Ward 8554 3668 3729 3770 3897 3988 4181 4310 4459 4600 4636 9650 9745 9812 9817 9989 10084 10508 10451 10597 10739 10779 It is important to bear in mind that, the population in Belgravia increased at a much faster rate than did the accommodation, as measured by the increase of premises rated to tiie relief of the poor. This will be evident by comparing the ratio of increase of ratings, with increase of population. But before treating of this further, let us go on with our statistical items:— Deaths in St. George's Hospital for the year ended 1st April, 1865, 336 Non-parishioners who died there, 264 Parishioners who died there, 72 From the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts, 21 From the Belgrave, 51 Deaths in Mount-street Workhouse, 112 Deaths in Little Chelsea Workhouse, 24 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1868 1864 311 314 316 330 308 317 328 255 251 243 263 243 253 260 56 63 73 67 65 64 61 — — 24 27 22 19 17 — — 49 40 43 45 44 88 75 72 96 69 100 104 41 33 28 25 27 26 36 Mortality and Death-Rate of Hanover and Mayfair. In these Sub-Districts the gross number ot deaths in the year ended 1st April, 1865, was 612; in the years 1857 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1868 1864 563 605 543 567 534 570 577 630 The gross death-rate of this part of the Parish therefore this year has been 18 8; and has fluctuated between 16 and 19 per 1000 per annum, estimating the population as virtually stationary at 32,500. Division into Rich and Poor Streets. Rich Streets. We now proceed, as in former reports, to divide the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts into two classes of streets. 22 First, the aristocratic and first-class business streets and squares such as Albemarle and Arlington streets, North and South Audley streets Grosvenor and Berkeley squares, Old and New Bond streets, Bolton, Brook, and Bruton streets, &c., &c. We obtained an exact record of the population of these streets at the census of 1851, and we believe thore has been no material fluctuation since: the population of these streets was then 20,000. The deaths in them last year were 218, or at the rate of 10.9 per 1000 of the population. In the foregoing years, the numbers were: 1858 1859 1860 1801 1862 1868 1864 216 20!) 192 201 187 201 240 Out of the 21 s, the number of children's deaths under 5, was 41; last year it was 39, the year before 41, before that 43. Poorer Streets. Now if we take the second and third-class business streets, the mews, and the streets occupied by the artizan and servant classes,—sucli as Adam's-mews, Avery-row, Barlowmews, Bell-yard, &c., &c.—the population of these is 12,600, say 13,000. The total number of persons who died at home in these streets last year, excluding all that died in the workhouse or in the hospital, and all that were found in the park or streets, is 266, of whom 123 were children under 5, or nearly one-half. The rate of persons who died at home, is 21 per 1000. The number of deaths under 5 was 123 last year, and 121 the year before. 1857 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1863 1864 Total Deaths 251 293 269 279 241 303 258 273 Under Five 119 154 121 123 But all the deaths are not at home. There were 112 in the workhouse and in St. George's hospital. We say nothing of the 17 deaths in the Serpentine, the streets, or Hyde Park, because they do not belong to us as a parish; but taking the whole parish, we find that of the gross total of deaths 2015, no fewer than 208 or ten per cent. occurred in beds provided by public or private charity. Mortality in Belgrave Sub-District. The gross number of deaths in this Sub-District was 1381. In the 7 foregoing years it was 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1868 1864 1124 1262 1242 1210 1368 1279 1388 Estimating the population to be stationary at the calculated amount of last year, 59,500, the gross rate of mortality was about 23 2 per 1000. Excluding the deaths in St. George's hospital and workhouses, the people who died at home, were 1045, or at the rate of 17.5 per 1,000 living.

The lesson which we venture to enforce on the Vestry, as we ourselves learn it from an investigation of the facts, is, that it is of little use to bring forward broad general figures, without entering into details ; that to assert that a place is unhealthy intrinsically because a great many persons die there, is absurd ; that sanitary matters, drains, cesspools, &c , are very important as causes of death, and spare neither rich nor poor; still that they form only a small share of the general conditions, whether of plenty or poverty, ignorance or knowledge, virtue or vice, love of life, or carelessness of life, in which a population lives. In fact, the mortality is a test of the whole condition of the people, and not merely of the existence of nuisances as they are called. In former Reports, we have given the mortality in a group of squares in the Belgrave Sub-District, and compared it with that of a group of small streets, with the view of showing the greater general mortality in the poor streets than in the rich, and the greater proportion of children's deaths. But we were not in possession of figures to show the mortality per cent. Desirous of getting at some numbers with respect to the Belgrave Sub-District, and especially as regards the quantity of people displaced by the pulling down of houses, we made application to the RegistrarGeneral, who kindly ordered the original Census Documents of 1861 to be brought from the House of Lords to Somerset House, and to be placed at our disposal. From these we made as many extracts as our time permitted, and propose to set them forth here in order to shew the difference between a wealthy and a poor neighbourhood, within the same Sub-District. Suppose we take Belgrave-square as the type of the richer. The first fact is, that at the Census in April, 1861, out of 49 houses, it is evident, from the returns, that only 22 families were in town; the remainder were at country seats, watering places, &c. And this gives but an imperfect idea of the extent of change enjoyed by the richer in the autumn. Secondly,—Space.—The adjoining diagram represents the space occupied by the houses in Belgrave-square. At the time of the 24 Census, the numbers in that square were 142 males, 274 females, total 418, of whom 22 were under 15. This is probably an average number for the whole year; but let us give all the houses the same population as those of which the owners were in town at the time of the Census, the full population would be 6.27. The next is a diagram of a space forming one of the Enumeration Districts of the Census, comprising parts of Little Eburystreet, Warrad's-court. Ebury-square (an open space). Flask-row, Susannah-place, Upper Ebury-street (part of), Kemp's-row, Bridge-row, Darnlcy-cottages, Flask-lane, BoydVgardens, Averyfarm-row (south side), Girdler's-mews, and Ebury-place. In this there were 545 males, 642 females, total 1187 persons, of whom 302 were under 15 years of age. Thirdly,— Arrangement of Space.—When many human beings are to be planted on a small space of ground, the dwellings should be in good blocks, so arranged as to let the sun and wind have full sweep; and without odd close back yards, culs de sac. courts, &c., &c. The distinction between dwellings of rich and poor is clear enough in this respect from a glance at the diagrams. Fourthly,—Proportions of the Sexes.—Nothing is more remarkable than the accumulation of women of the active and healthy time of life, as servants in the houses of the rich. Throughout them, the women are to the men as 2 or 3 to one ; in the poorer, the proportions are nearly equal. Fifthly,—The Absence of Domestic Servants.—Out of the 333 families comprising the 1187 persons inhabiting the poor patch of streets above designated, there is not one domestic servant. Sixthly,—the proportion of children ; always greatest where the families are poorest and smallest. Hence such districts show the high mortality necessarily attendant on infant life. Moreover, it is almost impossible for one woman to rear children ; she must have the aid of others of her own sex, and the deficient means of the poor tell heavily here. Such are some few of the evils of poverty and of the statistics of the poor. Now we may compare the yearly mortality of the group of squares and streets, which we have given in earlier Reports; only 25 this year we add the population, the proportion of the sexes, and number of persons under 15, viz:- Population, Census 1861.

We now proceed to sum up the deaths from preventible or partially preventible causes in the whole parish. So-called Preventible Causes of Death.

In the Hanover and May-fair Sub-Districts, the total number of cases treated by the Parochial Medical Officers and at the Dispensary, Mount-street, and in the Sick-Wards of the Mountstreet Workhouse, has been 3732; a number under the average, because the Dispensary was closed for a month for repairs. In 1864 the numbers were 4450 ; in 1863, 3901; in 1862, 3803. Amongst them were 13 cases of small-pox treated at home, 10 sent to the Small-pox Hospital, and 8 private cases, total 26. Seven cases of chicken-pox, 11 of measles, 3! of scarlatina, 47 of whooping-cough, 114 of diarrhoea, 1 of cholera, 85 of fever, 3 of erysipelas, 569 of bronchitis and catarrh, 16 of diphtheria, 4 of pleurisy, 5 of pneumonia. As for the diseases not specified by name in this list, they are of a low sort, as might be expected amongst the class which resorts for gratuitous medical aid, as phthisis, indigestion, and the like. We notice, with regret, the frequent entries of the itch, as that is really a complaint which ought to be unknown in this Parish, with its baths and washhouses. Sickness in the Belgrave Sub-District. In the Belgrave Sub-District 82,919 persons were treated by the Parochial Surgeons, and at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St. Paul and St. Barnabas' Dispensary, and the Workhouse, Little Chelsea; of these 20,449 were patients at St. George's Hospital. The whole number includes 45 of small-pox, 79 of chicken-pox,45 of measles, 188 of scarlet fever, 123 of whooping-cough, 3 of croup, 951 of diarrhoea, 32 of dysentery, 231 of continued fever, 135 of rheumatic fever, 93 of erysipelas, 36 of diphtheria. 14 of cholera, 2 of ague, and 10 of carbuncle. 27 There were also 2557 cases of bronchitis, 76 of pleurisy, and 180 of pneumonia. Vaccination in the Hanover and May fair Sub-Districts. In the year ending 1st April, 1865, the number vaccinated was 232, of whom 225 were successfully done. Three only of the above were secondary vaccinations. The latter are largely practised in times of panic during an epidemic of small-pox; for instance, last year there were 318 primary, and 526 secondary vaccinations. Vaccination—Belqrave District.

We are also able to report some improvement in the cleanliness of the children, especially in the St. Mark's district, where the very able and conscientious masters and mistresses have often a very rough material to deal with. This is also the case at the Catholic schools, which are resorted to by the Irish children, amongst whom the whole standard of cleanliness is not so high as amongst the English, and amongst whom skin disease and eye disease abound in consequence. We confess we have been tempted in all these schools to wish that the duty of personal cleanliness and attention to the laws of health were enforced as being a part of the law of God. In most of the schools the arrangements for stowing away the infants' clothes are very objectionable: so, too, is the construction of those galleries in which rows of infants are closely packed together. Local Censuses—Overcrowding. In order still further to promote vaccination, we employ a person from time to time to look up children who have been born within a few months, but have not been vaccinated; for which purpose we procure for the Registrars lists of children born within a year, and not known to have been vaccinated. At other times the messenger is sent into every room of every house in low districts, so as to find out unvaccinated children who may not have been born in the parish; and at the same time to note the numbers of the inhabitants, that we may judge of the extent of overcrowding. Thus in February and March 1865, the following were the results of a petty census compared with the numbers of the Census of 1851:— Houses. Adult inhabitants. Children under 14. Total. Census 1851. Hertford-place 10 87 81 156 173 May's-buildings 6 64 36 100 122 Robert-street 29 232 136 358 500 Thomas-street 26 231 199 430 600 Tom's-court 5 42 40 82 101 Hanover-place, Oxford-street 16 154 90 244 301 Dolphin-court 5 27 17 44 49 Weaver's-court 8 32 22 54 55 Eaton-place, North-row 5 20 13 33 62 George-street, Grosvenor-square, Lancashire-court and other places were visited, but not so systematically. It must be remembered that a private individual cannot go with the authority of a Census Enumerator; still, making every allowance, it is clear that over-crowded as the people may be, they are less so than in 1851. 29 In the above places thirty children were found who were not vaccinated; but only about half were of the age prescribed by law. Displacement of Population in Pimlico. We referred to this in our Report, No. XXVIII., dated 1st October, 1864. According to the doctrines we have laid down, the nominal healthiness of a parish must increase, or in other words, its death-rate be diminished, by any substitution of a higher for a lower class of inhabitants. On the other hand, by a reconstruction of the dwellings of the lower orders in straight, open, symmetrical blocks, in long lines such as the sun and wind can sweep with no cuts de sac, not a poor man need be displaced from the parish, and with the same population there would be a lesser death-rate. The following houses and population, according to the Census 1861, are those in the vicinity of the Victoria Terminus, which have been or are likely to be displaced:— Street. No. of Houues. Class.

The number of complaints entered in the Inspector's Report Book, between April '2nd, 1864, and April 1st, 1865, is 658, of which 253 relate to premises in the Hanover and May-fair, and 400 to the Belgrave Sub-Districts. The number of notices served has been 105. The number of premises to which they refer is 510 in the Belgrave and 311 in the Hanover and May-fair Districts. The number of summonses taken out has been 3. 30 Mr. Grant reports that there are 35 slaughter-houses, 16 cowyards, 29 marine store dealers, and 94 bakehouses in the Parish. The Sanitary Improvements in the Parish, between April 2nd, 1864, and April 1st, 1865, inclusive, are shown in the following Table, compiled from the Nuisances' Complaint Book, kept by Mr. Grant:— Dwelling Houses.

We are sorry to say, that one of our most respectable parishioners, Mr. Elphinston, the baker, was subjected to annoyance of the same sort, and feel it right, for the information of the Vestry, to lay the case before them. The complaint stated below was made to the Right Hon. Sir George Grey, by an association called the " Operative Bakers' Vigilance Association;" by him it was referred to Mr. Tremenheere, who wrote to the Vestry Clerk. Here is our Report on the facts after a most careful inspection in company with Mr. Grant. It was forwarded to Mr. Tremenheere, and embodied in a Parliamentary Paper, No. 175, entitled " Copies of Reports, by Mr Tremenheere, upon the working of the ' Bakehouses' Regulation Act, 1863,' and of correspondence as to the complaints made by operative bakers, that the Act has not been enforced." " In consequence of a letter addressed to the Vestry Clerk of the Parish of St. George. Hanover Square, we have visited the bakehouse of Mr. John Elphinston, 227, Regent-street, in order to test the accuracy of a complaint stated in the said letter, to 32 have been made by the Operative Bilkers' Association to Secretary Sir George Grey, viz.:— " The complaint stated that 'the oven-flues are carried under men's sleeping apartment; from six to eight men sleep in three beds. Hot-water plates for making jellies adjoining water-closet, and in bakehouse between biscuit-board and oven ; the stench from same frequently intolerable.' " The bakehouse and premises in question are situated at the corner of Regent-street and Hanover-street, and receive light and air from each. That part of the basement of the house which looks into Hanover-street is occupied by the pastry kitchen and the men's bedroom. The bakehouse proper consists of one large space formed by the area of the house on its Regent-street side, and by the space under the pavement, and of detached vaults adjoining. " The hot-water plate for making jellies is in the pastry kitchen, on that side of the house farthest from Regent-street. It is not near any water-closet whatever. " The men's bedroom adjoining contains two beds, in which three men sleep at present. It is ample in size, and thoroughly well lighted and ventilated. The floor partly stone, partly boards. There is no fire-place, but there is a special opening for ventilation near the ceiling, leading through to the other side of the house. " The bakehouse is on the Regent-street side, as aforesaid. There are two ovens on the east side (i. e. the side furthest from the house) and one on the north side. The flues from the two on the east side pass under the floor of the bakehouse, and under one corner of the men's bedroom, to a shaft at the back of the house. The flues are said to be at least a foot below the floor of the bakehouse ; and as the bakehouse floor (to which we descend by two steps) is at least 18 inches below the floor of the men's bedroom, it follows that the flues must be 2½ feet below the level of the latter, and it is very improbable that any heat passes upwards from them. '• The bakehouse is a spacious place, lighted and ventilated by skylights over the Regent-street area, and over the door which leads in from the Hanover-street area. There are also gratings opening on to the pavement above. The water-closet is situated in a recess on the Regent-street side ; it was newly constructed, under the local authority of St. George, Hanover-square, and the whole premises properly drained by pipe-drains in February 1859. It is well supplied with water and in good order, and there is a special grating for ventilation between it and the bakehouse. " During the repeated visits which we have paid to this bakehouse, especially since the Bakehouse Act came into operation, we have never noticed any offensive smell, nor has any complaint been made to the local authority. " In conclusion, the premises appear to us to be clean, dry, and one of the best of the 96 in the parish." 33 CONCLUSION. In conclusion, we venture to believe that our labours are slowly working great good. The number of instances of dwellings, even of the most respectable class, exposed to sewer vapours, is steadily decreasing; nuisances of all sorts are kept under ; no epidemic disease is allowed to acquire dangerous proportions ; crowding is abated; and with the reconstruction of dwellings, with the increased habits of cleanliness, and with the religious sense of the value of life and health in which the younger population is educated, we believe that our Parish will keep its ancient reputation as one of the healthiest in London.

London. PRINTED BY GEORGE PHIPPS, UPPER RANELAGH STREET, PIMLICO, S.W. TO THE Destry of St. George, Hanober Square. My Lords and Gentlemen, In the quarter that ended on Saturday, 1st of July, 1865, 518 deaths were registered, including those of 87 nonparishioners at St. George's Hospital, and of 4 inmates at Little Chelsea Workhouse. In the corresponding period of last year, 466 deaths took place, or 52 less than in the present quarter. The weekly average is 39, while that of the preceding ten years is 34.3. Zymotic disease destroyed 98 persons. Amongst these deaths we record one from small-pox, the death of the eldest son, aged 40, of a peer, in Stratton-street, Piccadilly. One from chicken-pox of an infant, aged 3 months, in Weststreet, Pimlico. There were 24 deaths from measles, or double the number of those that happened during the corresponding quarter of 1864. They chiefly occurred to children, and were nearly equally distributed in the two parochial divisions, as follows—Brown-street, Thomas-street, Robert-street, and Hart-street Grosvenor-square; Swan-passage Mount-street, Street's-buildings, Tom's-court, Duke-street, and Hayes-mews, in the In-Wards; Churton-street, Stanley-place, Hindonstreet, Hindon-place, Wallis's-yard, Eaton-court, Brewerstreet, Old Barrack-yard, Percy-cottages, St. George's-place, Warwick-place, North, Effingham-street, and Wilton-mews, in the Belgrave Sub-District. 4 There were 11 deaths from scarlet fever, viz., in Greenstreet, Robert-street, Grosvenor-square, and John's-court; the remaining 7 happened in Berwick-street, Brewer-street, Westmoreland-place, Eccleston-square, Elizabeth-place, Eatoncourt, at St. George's Hospital from Elizabeth-place Queenstreet. Diphtheria destroyed 5 children and 1 adult, viz., John's-court, Adam's-mews, Maddox-street, Coleshill-stree and Lupus-street. Croup proved fatal to a child, aged 1 year, in Effinghamstreet, and whooping-cough to 16 children. The Mortality Table annexed to this Report, shows that 16 persons died of fever, namely—a woman, set. 37, in Gilbert-street, Grosvenor-square; an infant of 1½ years, in Union-street, Oxford-street; a schoolmaster, aged 20, in South-street, who contracted the complaint at Wandsworth ; a boy, aged 3, in Lupus-street; a girl of 24, in Charlwoodplace; a girl of 5, in New Grosvenor-place ; a man, set. 42, in Upper Ebury-street; a woman, set. 58, in Ebury-street; a nurse, set. 42, in St. George's Hospital; a girl, set. 12, in Hanover-street; and a female, aged 34, in Lupus-street. Five non-parishioners died in St. George's Hospital. Erysipelas killed 3 persons, in one of whom it appeared after wounds in the head, produced by a fall while struggling with a friend, who had interfered to prevent the deceased attacking another man. There were also 6 deaths from pyæmia, 5 of which occurred in St. George's Hospital, 4 being those of nonparishioners. A gentleman, aged 55, died from carbuncle in Wiltoncrescent, and a patient in the Sick Wards of the Workhouse, Mount-street. A surgeon, aged 48, died of dysentery in the Grosvenor Hotel, Pimlico. 5 There were 8 deaths from diarrhœa, besides one on June 19, from cholera, of an infant, set. 9 months, at 14, Flask-lane, Ebury-square. Diseases of degeneration and ill-development destroyed 128 patients, including, from premature birth 10, teething 2, atrophy and debility 17, water in the head 15, tabes mesenterica 7, convulsions 13, and consumption 64. Lung diseases proved fatal to 67 persons. We observe among the accidental deaths, 7 from fractures and contusions, one of a porter, aged 83, who died of pleurisy after falling against a trunk on the grating of an area and fracturing his ribs. The remaining 4 were those of non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital. Six deaths were caused by burns and scalds, one of an infant, set. 1 year, from New Bond-street, who died in St. George's Hospital, after scalding his chest by a cup of coffee upset by himself. Another in Conduit-street, of a woman, set. 46, through her crinoline taking fire at a grate. A postman, set. 45, was found drowned in the River Thames; a domestic steward, set. 68, was found dead in a warm bath at the St. George's Baths, Lower Belgrave-place; and an infant, set. 5 weeks, in the Serpentine River. A newly-born infant was found suffocated in Hyde-park. The case of suicide, is that of a man, aged 37, who was found hanging by his handkerchief to the iron railings in Stratton-street, with his feet on the ground. Among the deaths from causes not specified or ill-defined, were those of a child found on a dunghill in Grosvenor-street, and of two in Hyde-park ; of a newly-born infant found dead in the pan of a water-closet in Ebury-street, another on the floor of a water-closet at the Victoria Station, and another yet in Stanley-street. 6 the sickness. In the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts, the number of patients attended gratuitously, at their own homes, by the Medical Officers of the Parish, and of the Dispensary Mount-street, and in the Sick Wards of the Workhouse Mount-street, was 1,095. Amongst them were 6 cases of small-pox, one of chickenpox, 100 of measles, 5 of scarlatina, 11 of whooping-cough, 43 of diarrhoea, 16 of continued fever, 2 of erysipelas, 162 of bronchitis and catarrh, 3 of diphtheria, and one of pleurisy. The six cases of small-pox, formed, as it were, a petty epidemic in one street. They were those of— April 8. Kate L., aged 6; 7, Thomas-street, vaccinated. Mary Anne H., 4, ib. ditto April 15. Mary S., 35, ib. ditto James W., 11 months, ib. ditto May 6. James P., aged 24, ib., vaccinated when an infant, and again five years ago. April 15. Thomas H., 2 ; 39, Thomas-street, not vaccinated, sent to the Small-pox Hospital. Besides these six cases, three children— April 20. Katharine W, 7 ; 4, Thomas-street. Ann, 8, ib. Henry, 1, ib., all vaccinated, had the small-pox and measles together; but so slightly as not to require a medical attendant. April 29. A girl named Ann H., sent to the Smallpox Hospital, from 63, Grosvenor-street. June 5. A man sent from St. George's Hospital to Mountstreet, and sent on to the Small-pox Hospital. These, with the fatal case in Stratton-street, on the 28th May, mentioned before, bring up the number of cases of small-pox that have come to our notice in the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts, since December 1852, to 168. 7 There were sent to the Fever Hospital one parishioner from 35, Gilbert-street, May 19; one tramp, who died June 8 ; and two inmates of the Workhouse, one of whom died June 30, and one other, whose case was not fever. The 100 cases of measles were distributed equally over the poorer parts of the Districts. The other cases of zymotic disease call for no particular observations at present, except that each house infected was duly visited, and such measures of cleansing carried out as could be enforced. sickness during the quarter. In the Belgrave Sub-District 8,209 persons were treated by the parochial surgeons, at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St. Paul and St. Barnabas' Dispensary, and at the Workhouse, Little Chelsea. Of these 5,235 were patients at St. George's Hospital, leaving a remainder of 2,974. The total figures include 9 of small-pox, 18 of chickenpox, 94 of measles, 34 of scarlet fever, 26 of whooping-cough, 137 of diarrhoea, 7 of dysentery, 25 of continued fever, 18 of rheumatic fever, 15 of erysipelas, 2 of diphtheria, and 2 of carbuncle. There were 477 cases of bronchitis, 8 of pleurisy, and 29 of pneumonia.

They were, however, extending their works, and have commenced a new engine-house, where they intend to erect two new engines, each of 150 horse power, leaving room for two more of the same power. This extension of the works is required in consequence of the great increase of the District to which the water is supplied. APPENDIX. No. II.

JVos. 31 to 45, Queen-street.—These houses have undergone nearly the same process. Cow-yard, Brewer-street.—This yard requires constant supervision, as so many of the neighbours throw vegetable refuse upon the dung, although the owner of the cows has put up a notice prohibiting the nuisance. Crate's Livery Yard behind Halkin-street, West.—The complaints of effluvia from this place have been brought before the notice of the Sanitary Committee, one of whom, with a Medical Officer, made a special visit and inspection, when the owner promised to do what might be required. No. 21, Eccleston-place.—This house was whitewashed and cleansed in consequence of small-pox occurring to a youth, set. 15, vaccinated. Dr. Aldis made a house to house visitation, and having ascertained that Pickford's infant, set. 3 months, Brook's child at No. 9, another named Buckland at No. 14, and the last named Agar, were all unvaccinated ; he requested Dr. Webb to be kind enough to visit the houses and vaccinate the children, which he did immediately. A house to house visitation had also been previously made in Cutmore-buildings, in consequence of small-pox having occurred at No. 5, as mentioned in Summary No. XXX, when a nest of unvaccinated children was found, namely— Mary Jane Jarvis, at No. 1; also Mary Ann Wright, a neighbour's child, who happened to be taken there by her mother, and lives at No. 8, Wallis's-yard ; a child at No. 5, and 3 children at No. 8. Another child, unvaccinated, who had probably been concealed from us, was afterwards attacked with small-pox; but the disease did not spread among those who were recently protected by the operation. The mother of the 3 children at No. 8, although she did not 13 " hold with vaccination," and was strongly opposed to its being performed, still, upon a second visit, was persuaded to have it done. APPENDIX. No. IV. gas. Seventy-two observations were made during the quarter, upon the six gases supplied by the Chartered, London, and Equitable Companies, at the Works in the Horseferry-road, Bessborough-street, and Cambridge-street, respectively. The gases were burned in accordance with the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, and the illuminating power continued above the standard required by the Act. With respect to purity, all the gases were free from sulphuretted hydrogen, and so far free from ammonia, that they did not discolour the turmeric paper, except on April 17th, when the cannel gas of the Equitable Company presented slight traces of ammonia; and on May 24th, when the common gas of the London Company showed a similar impurity. The following Table gives the average light in sperm candles of all the gases— Cannel Common Chartered. 23.59 14.56 London. 25.32 14.63 Equitable. 25.66 15.17 A Table and Summary were sent with each Monthly Report on the gas to the Vestry, containing the number of examinations and the pressures, with the dates, and the weekly and monthly average illuminating power.

London : PRINTED BY GEORGE PHIPPS, UPPER RANELAGH STREET, PIMLICO, 8.W. TO THE Vestry of St. George, Hanover Square. My Lords and Gentlemen, Our table of mortality shows that 451 deaths have been registered in the parish during this quarter, including those of 49 strangers in St. George's Hospital, and 4 inmates of the Little Chelsea Workhouse. Let us bring forward the mortality of the corresponding quarters of the foregoing eight years. Third quarter of Total deaths, St. George, Hanover Square. Total Zymotic. Deaths under L year.

In addition to 14 deaths from those causes in the Hanover and Mayfair subdistricts, and 29 in the Belgrave, one death occurred in 4 the Mount-street Workhouse, and 2 of non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital, so that the entire number is 46. As we have said before, the difference between a high and low rate of mortality in the first and third quarters of the year depends on differences of temperature, with bronchitis in the cold, and diarrhoea in the heat, and on the amount of zymotic disease. This quarter, unluckily, there is a rather full average of both. The chief victims of bowel disorder are young children. Out of the 46 cases just mentioned, 34 were under 5 years of age. If to these we add the 6 who died from privation of breast milk, one from scurvy, or the purples, as the vulgar call it, 25 from scrofulous disease, 12 from the brain diseases of infancy, 11 from premature birth and mal-development, and 16 from various forms of atrophy, we get 108 children under 5 as an instalment of young lives cut off by those town influences, which deserve more and more in these days the attention of the philanthropist and philosopher. Granted a child born of delicate parents, brought up by hand on food not always fit for it, or, if fit, at times a little sour, living in close ill-ventilated rooms, and with a taint of sewer vapour in the house in hot weather, these conditions are quite enough for engendering fatal diarrhoea. Almost the first case recorded in the mortality returns for the quarter is that of an infant, child of a medical man, in a very ill-ventilated house, never sweet, and in which, though inhabited by a medical family for at least thirty years, the drainage consisted of an old broken brick drain covered with wood. So Mr. Grant found when we set him to explore the house. Out of the deaths from bowel disorder, 3 in the Belgrave sub-district were sufficiently marked to entitle them to the name cholera. One was the death of a child of 20 months, at 5, Flask-lane; the other of a child of 4 months, at Darnley's-cottages; the third of a farrier, set. 55, in Hart's- 5 yard. One death from dysentery, in Swallow-place, led to enquiry about the efficiency of the drainage, soon followed by complaints from the inhabitants, and the eradication of a set of old choked-up brick drains. Measles continue to be extremely prevalent, and proved fatal to 22 children. Scarlet fever, diphtheria, and croup to 26 children and two adults. Two children are said to have died of croup at No. 14, Eaton-court. Whooping-cough destroyed 8 children. Typhoid and typhus fever, which is less exclusively a disease of early life, destroyed 8 lives; one in the Hanover sub-district, viz.,—a young sailor lodging in Avery-row; four in the Belgrave, viz.,—a child of 5 in Clarendon-street; another of 10 in another house in that street; the wife of a coachman, in Belgrave-mews; and a butler, aged 23, in Grosvenor-place. A valet, aged 23, from Warwick-square ; and a woman of 24, from Johnson's-place, died of this fever in the hospital, besides one non-parishioner. Altogether, 226 children died under five years of age, as a set-off to 632 births. Besides four persons who died from delirium tremens, intemperance and starvation are said to have killed a widow of 60. Two of the cases of delirium tremens were brought on by wound or fracture, which often puts the disease into activity when there is a tendency to it; the [other two occurred to domestic servants. The deaths from accident or negligence are instructive, as usual. One lady of 83 died from falling in her room; a bricklayer's labourer of 21, by the fall of brickwork upon him; a boy of 13 was knocked down and killed by a Hansom cab, at Hyde-park-corner; a labourer of 46, from amputation of his leg, which he broke in jumping from a cart; a labourer's boy fell from a scaffold at Kensington ; a cab-driver died from a kick in the bowels from a horse; a plumber, aged 24, 6 balanced himself and fell from the roof of a house, fracturing his skull; an inhabitant of Conduit-street, aged 62, died from the effects of a fall at the Charing-cross Railway Station. An idiot of 18 died of broken thigh, through getting entangled in bedding. A bricklayer was poisoned by Burnett's disinfecting fluid, which he mistook for gin. Of the burns,—one was of a child a year old, who had been playing with fusee matches;—a girl of 4, in Pimlico, died from drinking scalding coffee from the spout of a coffee pot; a girl of 4, from pulling a cup of scalding tea over herself; a shoemaker's wife of 53, from a cinder falling on her clothes; a girl of 4, from her clothes " igniting accidentally ;" a child of 7 months, it is not stated how. The child of a baker, in George-street, Grosvenor-square, aged 7 weeks, was suffocated in bed with its parents. A young man of 21 was drowned in the Serpentine whilst bathing; and a gentleman, aged 28, committed suicide by means of the fumes of charcoal when insane; another, aged 55, shot himself through the head with a pistol. The four deaths from causes not specified or ill-defined, are those of four infants, of which the Coroners' juries hesitated to affirm that they had been murdered, or which might have been born dead and cast away, such as a female child newly born, found in St. George's-place; another in Warwick-square ; and two in the Serpentine. the sickness. In the Hanover and May-fair sub-districts, the number of persons who received medical relief from the Medical Officers of the Parish, and of the Dispensary in Mountstreet, and in the Sick Wards of the Workhouse, Mount- 7 street, was 1,056; of these, the number admitted into the Workhouse, Mount-street, was 157, a number above the average of past years. Amongst them were no cases of small-pox, and none were sent to the Small-pox Hospital, and the absence of this disease is the only gratifying feature in the return. There were 11 cases of chicken-pox, 30 of measles, 28 of scarlatina, 2 of whooping-cough, 74 of diarrhoea, 4 of cholera, 18 of continued fever, 112 of bronchitis, one of pleurisy, and one of carbuncle. Of the measles we shall speak on a future occasion, remarking now that it was almost confined to July and the early part of August. The scarlatina was of a serious though limited character. The 28 cases infested 17 houses, and out of the number, 5 died at home, and one more in the Fever Hospital. One of the large piles of building called " Model Lodgings," and erected with the benevolent object of giving to the labouring classes cleaner and more comfortable homes, is yet so constructed that there is a deficiency in the general sweep of air over and through the building, and almost a necessity that the vapours of the wash-tub and of the water-closets shall be at times breathed and swallowed by the inmates, instead of being clearly blown away. Scarlet fever appeared in a child aged 2, at No. 5, in the week ending August 4. Next week another child, aged 4, had it in the same rooms. In the week ending 26th, a child of 9, at No. 3 ; September 2, the mother and baby at No. 5 ; September 16, three children at No. 24; September 23, another child at No. 24, and another at No. 3; September 30th, a boy at No. 24, and a girl at No. 27*. Three children were sent from No. 24 to the * A case appeared at No. 24, October 14th, and three at No. 23, November 11th. 8 Fever Hospital, where one died. Two died at No. 5, and one at No. 3. Of the things possible to check such an epidemic, the first is to remove the sick; the second, to cleanse and disinfect everything contaminated by infectious matter. The first was done to as great an extent as the people would consent to. Of the second class, we did obtain, and that as a permanent boon, the supply of water on Sundays,—the very morning when working-men are at home, and there is most use of water, and the consequences of unflushed sinks and closets most perilous. Disinfectants, as the chloride of lime, were used in some measure. Nevertheless, the means available for hindering the spread of infection from tenement to tenement were clearly worthless; and as for those for limiting infection when once within a set of rooms, they are also equally worthless. To go to people of this class and exhort them to exert themselves against the spread of contagion, is preaching to stone walls. They cannot see the meaning of the measures advised. When the disease once gets into a poor man's room, the case is hopeless. We tell them to move out whilst their room is cleansed, and the carpets, curtains, &c., disinfected. But the reply is, that this is impossible; that there is no other place to go to. They object to remove the sick person on the score of affection. They next affirm that it is dangerous and cruel to remove the sick ; and end by getting, perhaps, a certificate from some medical man out of the parish, which shall delay the cleansing ordered by the local authority. This is no exaggerated account of the difficulties in the way of suppressing scarlet fever at the outset. The 74 cases of diarrhoea were distributed amongst all ages, in all parts of the sub-district; two only can be identified with the deaths,—that of a woman of 85 in Swan'spassage, and a child in Little Bruton-street, who died in 9 October. The cases of cholera were two of elderly men, and of two inmates of the workhouse; not one fatal. Of the 18 fever cases, not one was fatal. There were sent to the Fever Hospital, on 3rd August, 2 scarlet fever cases from 14, Brown-street; on the 30th, Jane S., from No. 11, Pollen-street; on the 31st, Harriett Dewey, a tramp from the Workhouse; the 3 children beforementioned, from No. 24, B.-place, on the 14th, 16th, and 18th September; and Mary Ann Jackson, a tramp from the Workhouse, on the 29th September. There died also in St. George's Hospital a child, aged 2, of diphtheria, from No. 4, Dolphin-court; another child died in the same house of diarrhoea. The whole court has since been cleansed and paved afresh, and an ill-kept urinal abolished. sickness in the belgrave sub-district. In the Belgrave Sub-district 7,376 persons were treated by the parochial surgeons, and at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St. Paul and St. Barnabas' Dispensary, and at the Workhouse, Little Chelsea. Of these, 4,704 were patients at St. George's Hospital, leaving a remainder of 2,672. The total figures include 4 of chicken-pox, 67 of measles, 24 of scarlet fever, 42 of whooping-cough, 359 of diarrhoea, 14 of dysentery, 25 of continued fever, 3 of rheumatic fever, 18 of erysipelas, 2 of diphtheria, and 3 of carbuncle. There were 307 cases of bronchitis, 8 of pleurisy, and 25 of pneumonia. 10 APPENDIX. No. I. water.

No. III. special cases. No. 1, Hertford-place.—Legal proceedings frustrated by uncertainty of ownership of premises complained of.—A child died of diphtheria, complicated with scarlatina, in this house, in the last week of March. Not only for the purpose of disinfection, for which purpose it ought to have been cleansed even though already clean, but because the house, yard, and area really required limewashing, a notice was served and instructions given by the Sanitary Committee on the third Tuesday in April that a summons should be taken out if it were disobeyed. The walls of the kitchen, also, were covered with tattered, mouldy paper, the floor quite dilapidated and in holes, revealing a wet earth close underneath. As the notice was disregarded, a summons was taken out and came on for hearing on the 2nd June. Then a person appeared representing the owner, and on his promise to do what was required, the magistrate, as is usual, adjourned the case for a month. But on the 30th June, after expiration of the month, nothing had been done; therefore the magistrate made an order, requiring the necessary works to be done forthwith. As this order was equally disregarded, the Sanitary Committee ordered a summons to be taken out for penalties under the 14th section of the Nuisances Removal Act. This came on for hearing on Tuesday, the 15th August; but, as the nominal defendant, Mr. W. Cullen, of 39, Jermyn-street, was out of town, it was adjourned again until Wednesday, the 30th, when it was heard by Mr. Mansfield and dismissed—the reason being that the property changed hands at Midsummer, and that the defendant had ceased to be agent when the order was made. Meanwhile the house had been partially cleansed at the beginning of August, and so the case was let drop. But it 14 ought to be noticed that protracted and repeated attendances at police-courts. with such results, are discouraging to the Sanitary Committee and to the sanitary officers of the Vestry. Dungpit in Little Brown-street.—This is another case in which legal proceedings failed through the insolvency of the defendant and the uncertainty who was the real person responsible. This dungpit was in the occupancy of a " Limited" Brewery Company, whose offices were closed. It was left full of offensive matter. It was reported to the Sanitary Committee at their meeting in July; a summons taken out and heard on the 15th August; the magistrate made an order requiring the owner to cleanse and disinfect; but how to serve a notice on a dungpit ? so, after waiting some days yet, it was cleansed out and disinfected by Mr. Grant's directions at the parish expense.—See Quarterly Return, No. XXV. Drainage of Swallow-place.—This was inquired into by the Medical Officer of Health, in consequence of a death from dysentery in July. Soon afterwards a complaint was lodged against the drainage and cleanliness of No. 4. A notice which was served was disregarded, so that a summons was taken out, which came on for hearing on August 15th; but, as the defendant did not appear, the case was adjourned till the 22nd, by which time the old rotten brick drains had been replaced by pipes, the old privy abolished, a new water-closet erected, and the whole premises cleansed and sweetened. Drainage of Mount-row.—This row of nine houses has always been infested with fever and diarrhoea in a greater degree than could be accounted for. Several explorations had been made of the drainage; but at last, on a stoppage occurring at No. 5, Carpenter-street, Mr. Grant found that Nos. 4, 5, and 6, Mount-row, with the Oliver's Mount 15 public-house, and Nos. 8 and 9, Mount-row, drained through an old obstructed sewer, connected with which was a very large cesspool in the cellar of the public-house. Hanover-place.—A case of cholera was reported at No. 2, so that a regular raid was made upon every house, and a notice served requiring limewhiting of all yards, areas and basements, trapping of sinks, &c. A summons was taken out on August 22nd and fixed for hearing on August 30th, but when we came to the court, there was no defendant, for the summons had been lost by the summoning oflicer, so that another was taken out for the 6th September, by which time all cleansing and repairs had been finished. No. 99, Davies-street.—The yard behind the house dirty and offensive from overflow of sewage water and from the filth occasioned by keeping rabbits. A summons taken out was heard on Sept. 6th, when the magistrate granted an order, which was obeyed, and the work done and costs paid. Overcrowding.—At No. 30, Grosvenor-mews, three generations, consisting of seven persons—viz., a woman, five children, and the infant of one of the daughters—slept in a space of about 1200 feet. This was put a stop to. Dolphin-court.—This very close court, occupied by five houses, was rendered unwholesome by a urinal at the entrance. This has been abolished, a door put to keep out intruders, and the court newly paved. Yard behind Nos. 3 and 4, Upper Belgrave-terrace.— Overflow of soil from a cesspool, oozing into the workshops from the adjoining premises in Robert's-buildings, Eburysquare. A notice was served on June 15, and the cesspool emptied and filled up. Nos. 1 to 14, Robert's-buildings, Ebury-sqnare.—Each house has been whitewashed and cleansed throughout, the water butts cleansed, and the yards limewashed. Messrs. Gates' Stable-yard, behind No. 5, Halkin-street 16 West.—Numerous complaints have been made of this yard on account of accumulations of dung, which greatly annoy some of the inhabitants in Halkin-street West and Lowndesstreet. The yard was frequently visited by the Inspector of Nuisances and the Medical Officer of Health, who complained to the Nuisances Removal Committee of the uneven state of the pavement, allowing water to stagnate and become offensive. The yard has been repaired in some parts. No. 1, Elizabeth-street South.—A new water-closet has been erected, the privy with the brick drains abolished, and new pipe drains laid down. Upper Denbigh Mews.—Many complaints were made that the dung was not properly removed, the paving again out of repair, the yard not swept properly, the water-closets often obstructed, and the cisterns over them defective. These evils have been remedied, and the dung is more frequently removed. No. 2, Union-street, Pimlico.—Cholera occurred here to a woman, who fortunately recovered. Complaints were made of effluvia from a tripe shop, and of over crowding; but these complaints were unfounded, and the house was very clean. A nuisance, however, was detected by the Medical Officer, arising from the making of portable manure on the roof of a stable in the cow-yard behind Union-street, which unhealthy practice was stopped, and the cow-sheds have been converted into stables. Harfs-yard, West-bourne-street.—A death from cholera occurred here. The infected rooms have been whitewashed and cleansed. The patient, a man, is said to have committed some excess in eating and drinking the night before his death. Haft's Cow Yard, Brewer-street, Pimlico.—So many complaints had been made by the inhabitants during the past year of the effluvia and of neglect in the removal of refuse 17 that, upon our recommendation, the magistrates withdrew his licence. Phoenix-yard, Burton-street, Pimlico.—The owner of this place complained of the pump-water in his stable-yard. The water was analysed, and an imperial gallon contained 147 grains of solid matter, of which 13*2 grains were lost by ignition, while the organic matter amounted to 3 grains. The saline matter consisted of nitrates and chlorides, with an appreciable quantity of earthy phosphates. The water also contained ammonia. These characteristics indicated the presence of sewage matter, and rendered the water dangerous to health. A drain passed close by the well, while a gas-pipe was just above it. The owner promised to use the water for cleansing purposes only, and has erected a very large slate cistern, which is supplied with water by the Chelsea Company. Conduit between the Cascade at the end of the Serpentine and Rotten-row.—The water here and the drain into which it falls became so offensive that your Medical Officer wrote to the Hon. W. Cowper upon the subject, and received a reply from Mr. Alfred Austin, the secretary, that means would be immediately taken to prevent the noxious exhalations by the application of lime and the removal of mud, which have been carried into effect. A proposed Sanitarium in Kinnerton-street.—A memorial was sent to your Medical Officer early on September 16, signed by 42 inhabitants of Kinnerton-street and Wiltonplace, complaining that a Sanitarium for receiving diseased cows was about to be established in a yard in Kinnertonstreet, and wishing him to oppose it on sanitary grounds. Dr. Aldis attended a meeting of the Sanitarium Committee held at the Mansion House in the afternoon, when, at the request of Mr. Gibbins. the chairman, he stated the reasons of his opposition, believing that it was one of the most 18 unfit places that could possibly be selected for the intended purpose. A letter was then read from the owner, withdrawing his permission for allowing the yard to be used as a Sanitarium. APPENDIX. No. V. gas. Seventy-two observations were made during the quarter, upon the six gases supplied by the Chartered, London, and Equitable Companies, at the Works in the Horseferry-road, Bessborough-street, and Cambridge-street, respectively. The gases were burned in accordance with the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, and the illuminating power continued above the standard light required by the Act. With respect to purity, all the gases were free from sulphuretted hydrogen, and so far free from ammonia, that they did not discolour the turmeric paper. The following Table gives the average light in sperm candles of all the gases— Chartered. London. Equitable. Cannel 24.04 28.22 24.22 Common 13.94 14.56 14.11 A Table and Summary were sent with each Monthly Report on the gas to the Vestry, containing the number of examinations and the pressures, with the dates, and the weekly and monthly average illuminating power.

London: PRINTED BY GEORGE PHIPPS, UPPER RANELAGH STREET, PIMLICO, S.W. TO THE Vestry of St. George, Hanoder Square. My Lords and Gentlemen, During the quarter ended on the 30th December, 1865, the number of deaths registered in the Parish -was 511, including those of 65 non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital and 5 inmates of the Workhouse at Little Chelsea, giving a weekly average of 39. The weekly average of the foregoing ten years is 36.5. The number of births during the same period was 594. One of the 12 deaths from measles occurred in Georgestreet, Grosvenor-square; it was that of a young woman of 27. Eleven in Belgravia, as follows: Pulford-street, Effingham-street, Upper Ebury-street, Graham-street West, Grosvenor-cottages, New Grosvenor-place, West-street, Kingstreet, Stanley-street. Scarlet fever proved fatal to 14 persons : viz., of whom 12 lived in the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts; a boy in Reeves's-mews, Park-street; a boy in Davies-mews, Davies street; a girl and a boy in Mount-row; a girl in Northrow, Park-street; a boy in Thomas-street, Grosvenor-square; to another boy in Blomfield place ; and to an infant in Johnstreet, Grosvenor-mews. There were also deaths in John'scourt, South-street, Street's-buildings, and of a man of 50 in Old Bond-street. Two only of the deaths took place in Belgravia, namely, in Westmoreland-place and More ton-place. Diphtheria destroyed a boy, aged 3 years, in New Bondstreet ; a youth, aged 17, in the Workhouse, Mount-street; and a parishioner, aged 19, in the Hospital, who came from Farm-street, Berkeley-square. 4 An infant, aged 2, died from croup in Warwick-street, Pimlico. Of the 13 deaths from fever, 1 was of a non-parishioner, in the Hospital, and 1 a parishioner, who came from Woodstockstreet, Oxford-street. One occurred in Hereford-street, Park-lane (it was that of a young lady soon after confinement, and had nothing to do with zymotic disease), and 3 in the Mayfair district—namely, in Dover-street, Southstreet, and Clarges-street. Seven deaths happened in the following streets in Belgravia—Ranelagh-street, Gray's-innplace, Coleshill-street, Vauxhall-bridge-road, Churton-street, Hugh-street, and Cambridge-street. There were 16 deaths from diarrhoea, 8 of which occurred to infants under 1 year of age. Lung diseases destroyed 91 persons. Consumption, scrofula, convulsions, teething, and other diseases of degeneration and ill-development destroyed 114, including from premature birth 9, from atrophy and debility 9, water in the head 8, scrofula 1, tabes mesenterica 6, convulsions 19, teething 1, and consumption 61. Two persons died from the effects of intemperance in Belgravia. Nine persons died from fractures in St. George's Hospital, 7 being non-parishioners. A servant-maid, aged 17, died of a fractured skull and other injuries, from falling out of window in White Horse-street, Piccadilly; a labourer, aged 27, who lived in Little Ebury-street, died in St..George's Hospital from a fractured skull, received by a fall from a " traveller" at Smith and Taylor's Yard, Commercial-road, Pimlico ; a medical practitioner, aged 69, died in the same Institution from pressure on the brain, through being accidentally knocked down by a Hansom cab at Hyde Park Corner; a labourer, aged 35, died in New Grosvenor-place from fractured ribs and ruptured liver, through falling from a scaffold when at work; a porter at the Victoria Railway-station, aged 27, from fractured legs and other injuries, received while falling from a platform, the wheels of a railway carriage going 5 over him; and a boy, aged 10 years, was knocked down and run over by a waggon. Two children were burnt to death and another suffocated in the same room by inhaling the hot air and smoke, during the absence of the parents; an infant of 4 months was accidentally suffocated when in bed with its parents in Kinnerton-street; a doctor of medicine, aged 23, was poisoned by an overdose of morphia, taken medicinally ; a bootmaker, aged 45, drowned himself in the Serpentine River, Hyde Park; and a boy, aged 9, was drowned in the River Thames, at Thames Bank;—when at play he fell from a barge. Seven persons died from other injuries, two of whom were non-parishioners, in St. George's Hospital. Five deaths happened in Belgravia; one of a girl, aged 4 years, who injured her brain when accidentally falling from a staircasewindow in Moreton-street; another of a woman, aged 69, who fell downstairs in Westbourne-street; a barman, aged 34, whose body was mutilated by the wheels of railway carriages; a boy, aged 14, injured in Eaton-square by a scaffold-pole striking him; and an engine-driver, aged 41, who lived at 22, Westmoreland-place, and fell from a scaffold. A captain in the militia, aged 47, committed suicide, when insane, by hanging himself in his neck-scarf tied to a bedrail. Among the deaths from causes not specified or ill-defined are those of 3 infants: one was found dead in a urinal at Charles-street, Berkeley-square, another died immediately after birth in Stockbridge-terrace, and the third was found in one of the enclosures in Eaton-square. 6 the sickness. In the quarter ended 30th December, 1865, the number of patients attended by the Medical Officers of the Parish and Dispensary, and in the Sick Wards of the Workhouse Mountstreet, was 1,018, of which number, 161 were treated in the Workhouse. Amongst these cases were one of small-pox, 2 of measles, 20 of scarlet fever, 33 of diarrhoea, 17 of continued fever, 2 of ague, 4 of erysipelas, 242 of bronchitis and catarrh, 2 of diphtheria, one of pleurisy, and 3 of pneumonia. The case of small-pox was that of a young man named Charles B., aged 20, vaccinated, at 18, South Bruton-mews. The 20 cases of scarlatina, were at 3, John's-court, 21 and 23, Bloomfield-place, 10, Avery-row, Cock-yard, Providencecourt, Davies-mews, North-row, Mount-row, Grosvenormarket, Pollen-street, Union-street, S6, Thomas-street, Johnstreet, Grosvenor-mews, of these the following were fatal, viz.: in John's-court, 23, Bloomfield-place, 5, North-row, two at 5, Mount-row. One was sent to the Fever Hospital, viz., Thomas Pendrell, aged 12, from 10 Avery-row. Of the 33 cases of diarrhoea, one only can be identified in the death register, and not one of the 17 fever cases. A young woman of 24 died in the Workhouse, of puerperal fever, a week after delivery. The cases of ague happened to strangers. One of the diphtheria patients was a male-servant, aged 17, at a public-house in Duke-street, who died in the Workhouse. He slept in a very ill ventilated room, but no source of infection could be traced. A maid-servant was also sent to the Fever Hospital, from a house in Upper Grosvenor-street. 7 sickness in the belgrave sub-district. In the Belgrave Sub-District 7,851 persons were treated by the parochial surgeons, and at St. Georges's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St. Paul and St. Barnabas' Dispensary, and at the Workhouse, Little Chelsea. Of these 4,906 were patients at St. George's Hospital, leaving a remainder of 2,945. The total figures include 1 of small-pox, 3 of chickenpox, 85 of measles, 15 of scarlet fever, 105 of whooping-cough, 150 of diarrhoea, 3 of dysentery, 30 of continued fever, 5 of rheumatic fever, 19 of erysipelas, 3 of diphtheria, and 3 of carbuncle. There were 647 cases of bronchitis, 15 of pleurisy, and 44 of pneumonia. The following are the particulars of the case of small-pox, namely: No. 6, little Charlotte-street, Eliza Smith, aet 18—removed to the Small-pox Hospital. C. J. B. Aldis, M.D. R. Druitt. 8 APPENDIX.

No. IE. special cases. Absence of Drainage.—The following may serve as an example of a state of things which possibly may be found existing still in some of the older houses in the Parish, especially those inhabited by the better classes, and not subjected to exploration and inspection, as they would be if their inhabitants sought relief from the Parish or Dispensary. Of two contiguous houses in a good street, the drainage of one had been obstructed for years, and all the liquid sewage filtered away through the party-wall and basement to the drains of the other. Rice's Stables, Piccadilly.—These are, so far as we know, the only undrained stables of the sort remaining. A complaint was made that the basement walls of No. 114, Piccadilly, were made damp by leakage from the drains of these stables. A dry area was consequently constructed within 11 the stables, and on inspecting the works the Medical Officer was satisfied that the earth was only naturally damp, and not saturated, as had been imagined, with horse sewage. Still the stables are not drained, and the owners allege that they cannot do so without passing through other people's property. Drainage of South Molton-street.—An old sewer 120 feet long ran down the middle of this street, receiving the drainage of ten houses, Nos. 40 to 49 on the east side, and emptying itself by a transverse sewer running under Nos. 21 and 22 on the west side to the King's Scholars' Pond Sewer in South Molton Lane. This transverse part had fallen in under No. 21, creating a great nuisance in the house; and this led to the discovery of the longitudinal sewer spoken of, which was emptied of about 2 feet of deposit, and cleansed out, to serve again as sewer for the present. Drainage of part of Mount-row.—The drainage of one house in Carpenter-street and of one house in Mount-row passed into an old brick drain underneath a house in Daviesstreet, which had given way and created a great nuisance. This was replaced by pipes. It is mentioned as an instance of vicious old drainage systems, which are rooted out and abolished as fast as they come to light. Three houses in Lower Brook-street were found to drain into an old cesspool filled with deposit, which had a vent through some drains in Horseshoe-yard, which again had fallen in. All these miserable nuisances were cleared away, and pipes substituted. Complaint of a Dead Cow lying in Gillingham-street.— The complaint was made to the Medical Officer very late at night by the police, who wished to know what was to be done, as the driver had run away and the cow, supposed to be diseased, was surrounded by 100 people. The cow was removed to Atcherler's, in Maiden-lane. 12 Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7, Ebury-place, Ebury-square.— These houses were dirty and dilapidated throughout: the yards, water-closets and water-butts were also dirty. A notice was served, and they underwent a thorough repair. Thirty-seven bakehouses were inspected in the In-wards, and seven have been limewashed; and fifty-four were inspected in the Out-wards, when 30 were found to require limewashing, which has been done. BoyiTs-gardens, Ebury-square.—Dr. Aldis summoned a special meeting of the Nuisances Removal Committee, on October 30, 1865, to consider the state of these gardens. They consist of a narrow court, which is closed at one end. The following are extracts from his Report to the Committee :— " At No. 6, the floor of the upper front room is dilapidated, the water-butt is too small and without a tap, the water contained in it is filthy. There is no water to the closet, not even a pipe from the water-butt; the water-closet wants repairing. " No. 8 a. No water supply to the closet; the occupiers throw water down. The roof of the house admits rainwater, which trickles down to the kitchen. " No. 9. No water to the closet, and the paper in one of the upper rooms should be stripped off, as it swarms with bugs in summer, and the wall should be coloured. " Nos. 11 and 12 have two water-butts, which communicate with each other in the front yard. They leaked and had no tap, which was stolen and a piece of wood inserted instead. As 39 human beings lived in No. 11 alone, it was necessary to abate the overcrowding. As the pipes to the closets do not act, these are without water, and, many of the tiles over that of No. 11 being broken, an umbrella is required when it is used during rain. At No. 12 nine persons 13 slept in the front parlour, including the father, mother, a girl aged 17, and a youth of 16." One of the owners attended the meeting of the Committee, and has since remedied the evils. Nos. 1 to 7, Ebury place, Ebury-square.—Each house has been whitewashed and cleansed throughout and repaired, the yards and water-closets limewashed, the water-butts cleansed and new dust-pits erected. Nos. 8 to 12, Gray's Inn-place, Hindon-street, Pimlico.— Each house has been properly whitewashed and cleansed throughout, the yards newly paved, the water closets and washouses with the dust-pits repaired, and the sinks trapped; the fore-court also paved, and the washhouses, water-closets, and yards limewashed. Nos. 1 to 10, Robert-street, Pimlico, (North Side).— These houses have been whitewashed and cleansed; the yards, water-closets, and wash-houses limewashed, the water-closets and dust-pits repaired, the sinks trapped, and the paving in the yards repaired. No. 25a, Elizabeth-street, Eaton-square.—This was a case of combined (lrinage, the drains being connected with those of No. 60, Ebury-street, which were made of brick and were defective. They have been broken up and pipe ones laid down, and the basement whitewashed. No. 12, Boyd's-gardens, and the Stable-yard No. 5, Halkinplace.—Proceedings were taken in these cases against the owners, by order of the Committee, to remedy the overcrowding in the former one, and to repair the yard in the latter. The owners appeared before Mr. Arnold on November 30th, at the Westminster Police Court, when your Medical Officer and Mr. Grant also attended. The costs were paid, and the overcrowding had been abated, while the question of the stable-yard ended in the same satisfactory manner. 14 APPENDIX. No. V. gas. Seventy-two observations were made during the quarter, upon the six gases supplied by the Chartered, London, and Equitable Companies, in the Horseferry-road, Bessboroughstreet, and Cambridge-street, respectively. The gases were burned in accordance with the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, and the illuminating power continued above the standard light required by the Act. With respect to purity, all the gases were free from sulphuretted hydrogen, and so far free from ammonia, that they did not discolour the turmeric paper. The following Table gives the average light in sperm candles of all the gases:— Chartered. London. Equitable. Cannel 80.92 24.43 27.33 Common 14.28 14.16 14.96 A Table and Summary were sent with each Monthly Report on the gas to the Yestry, containing the number of examinations and the pressures, with the dates, and the weekly and monthly average illuminating power.
