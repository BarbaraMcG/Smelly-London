FOR 1955 Borough Council of Enfield ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health (WILLIAM D. HYDE, M.B., Ch.B., D.P.H.) FOR 1955 3 ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, 1955. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Enfield. I have pleasure in presenting my Annual Report for 1955. The area of the District is 12,401 acres. The population is approximately 109,000 and the number of inhabitated houses 31,219. Last year I referred particularly to the introduction of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954 and the Slaughterhouse Act, 1954, both of which came into force during 1954. A full calendar year of operation of these Acts has now been completed. In accordance with the provisions of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, the Council submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government, proposals for dealing during the next six years with 356 houses unfit for human habitation. During the year under review action was taken with regard to 47 such houses. A considerable amount of work was also undertaken in connection with part 2 of the Act, 40 applications for Certificates of Disrepair and 87 applications for revocation of Certificates being dealt with. The volume and responsibility of the work deriving from the slaughterhouse is shown by the increase from 9,175 to 33,284 in the number of carcases examined. With regard to the vital statistics of the Borough, the Birth Rate was somewhat lower than last year, being the second lowest this century, namely 12.49 compared with 12.38 in 1953. Compared with 1954 there was a reduction in the Death Rate, and quite a gratifying reduction in the Still Birth Rate from 25.44 to 15.89. Unfortunately there was one woman who died in consequence of childbirth. 4 The Infant Mortality Rate, I am glad to report, continues to be low, and generally the vital statistics compare favourably with the rest of the country. The reduction in the number of deaths by 62 is due mainly to 38 less from Cancer and 54 less from vascular lesions of the nervous system, but those from Pneumonia and Bronchitis have increased by 28. Deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Cancer of the lungs are slightly less at 14 from Pulmonary Tuberculosis and 52 from Cancer of the lungs, this latter figure being a continuing disturbing feature of the statistics, about which there is much speculation in regard to the inhalation of carcinogenic lung irritants, but at present little definite proof although considerable statistical evidence in certain instances. With regard to Infectious Diseases there was a marked increase in the number of cases of measles, only 2 of which, however, were admitted to Hospital. There was a notable reduction in cases of whooping cough, only 15 cases notified, none of which was admitted to Hospital. There was also a notable reduction in the number of cases of Scarlet Fever and only 16 were removed to Hospital. Unfortunately, poliomyelitis was more prevalent than during the previous year, 20 cases occurring and 3 adults dying of the disease. Although each case was carefully investigated no significant environmental or other factor was elicited. Apart from Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, and Poliomyelitis, the only other death from notifiable disease was one from Meningococcal infection. With the complete absence of Diphtheria from Enfield for 7 years and the reduction in the numbers of other infectious diseases requiring Hospital admission, the beneficial effects of the preventive health services, not only to the individual, but to the Hospital and other medical services, can be assessed. The main details and comments on the widespread responsibilities of the Department are given elsewhere in this Report and although no mention is made of the extensive range of personal health services for which I am responsible to the County Council, every endeavour is made to secure close co-operation and integration of all authorities and agencies working in the wide sphere of Health, Welfare and Social Services. 5 In conclusion, I should like once again to record my appreciation of the efforts of the staff of the Health Department during the present year. William D. Hyde, Medical Officer of Health. 6 BOROUGH OF ENFIELD J. cottenham, esq., J.P. Mrs. g. M. Jay, J.p. Mayor Deputy Mayor Aldermen : W. G. Bowyer, Esq. D. R. J. Boxall, Esq. G. Deacock, Esq.

It will be seen from Table II that of the 25 infants who died before attaining the age of 1 year, 23 died within the first four weeks of life, and of this number 19 deaths occurred in infants under 1 week. The main problem in connection with Infant Mortality is concerned with deaths within the first few weeks of life, mainly the first week during which 17 of the 19 infant deaths occurred from congenital malformation, premature birth and atelectasis. The infant mortality rate for the Borough is 18.35 and this figure compares most favourably with the rest of the country. 12 BIRTHS The corrected birth rates for both sexes, live and still births, which takes into consideration those born outside the Borough and those in the Borough not rightly recorded to the Borough, and also the corrected birth rates for the last five years are :— Year. Boys. Girls. Total. Birth-rate per 1,000 Population. Illegitimate Birth-rate per 1,000 Population. 1951 775 813 1,588 14.45 0.38 1952 715 747 1,462 13.32 0.38 1953 698 676 1,374 12.57 0.45 1954 709 706 1,415 12.95 0.52 1955 700 684 1,384 12.69 0.44 INQUESTS Fifty-nine Inquests and two-hundred-and-nine Post-mortem examinations without inquests were held during the year. Of these, 214 deaths were due to natural causes, 40 to accidental causes, 9 to suicide, 3 to misadventure, and in 2 cases an open verdict was recorded. FATAL HOME ACCIDENTS. Three years ago I wrote at some length on this subject, comparing Enfield figures with the National pattern. This year again in Enfield the emphasis is on fatal accidents to the aged. Of the 15 fatal home accidents to Enfield residents, involving 11 females and 4 males, all were to persons between the ages of 74 and 94. The precipitating cause of death in most cases was a fall, leading in many cases to fractured bones followed by lung complications, brain damage or circulatory failure. One death in a female aged 76 years was due to coal gas poisoning. The outstanding points in these figures are the high proportion of elderly females, 73 per cent, of the total, and the fact that no children were involved. One hears much more about Road accidents than accidents in the Home, and this year there were as many fatal accidents to Enfield residents in the home as there were in the streets, i.e., 15. In the case of road accidents, the percentage of males involved was 87 per cent, and the ages ranged from 7 years to 89 years. 13 The figures I have quoted indicate the continued need for propaganda to impress on the public the need to take every possible precaution to prevent accidents in the home, particularly where the aged are concerned, as an accident resulting in a fall can so frequently lead to fatal complications. It might not be inappropriate to mention here the occurrence of 9 cases of suicide, 4 males and 5 females, ages ranging from 26 years to 70 years ; the average age being 48 years. The method adopted in six cases was coal gas poisoning, one to gunshot wound of the head, and two to barbiturate poisoning. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACTS, 1948 AND 1951. No action was necessary during the year under these Acts with regard to the removal to suitable premises of persons in need of care and attention. Such cases as were brought to the notice of the Health Department were dealt with by the Medical Officer of Health in cooperation either with the Medical Practitioners or Welfare Officer, and the patients voluntarily agreed to go to Hospital or suitable Institution. Most old people show a natural reluctance to leave their homes, which sometimes consist of a single room in a dirty and unhygienic state owing to their inability to look after the premises. Some should not be living alone, and although we must not be hasty to criticize, there appears to be in some cases a need for the awakening of responsibility of the family to its aged members. In some instances, where reluctance to leave their homes is encountered, provision of Home Help and District Nurse Services can be arranged and a careful watch on the situation maintained by members of the Health Department Staff, and compulsory removal in the interests of the old person is rarely enforced, as persuasion usually succeeds in the end. AMBULANCE SERVICE The County Ambulance Service is operated in two distinct branches, i.e., the Accident Branch and the Sick Removal Branch. The Accident Service operates from Fire Stations and where an ambulance is required for accident or emergency purposes, the Emergency Exchange telephone facilities should be used, whereby calls are routed to the nearest Fire Station. The Sick Removal Service is housed locally in a newly-built depot adjacent to Chase Farm Hospital, where calls are received for both recumbent and sitting cases. 14 WATER SUPPLY The Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board, except for part of the Hadley Wood and Cockfosters area, which is supplied by the Barnet District Water Company. Both of these Authorities take regular and frequent samples for analysis. Copies of these reports are sent to the Health Department, and have shown satisfactory results. There was no cause to suspect any contamination during the year. There are three dwellings in Enfield which receive their water supply other than from a public company ; these are under constant supervision. The question of well-water supplies, both in connection with dwelling-houses and industrial premises, throughout the Borough has received the careful attention of the Department during the year, and every care has been exercised to see that such supplies are not used for drinking purposes where mains water supply is available, and during the year nine samples of well water were examined bacteriologically. In addition, one other sample of drinking water other than from wells was bacteriologically examined, and found to be satisfactory. MEDICAL ASSESSMENT OF EMPLOYEES. The following medical examinations or assessments of employees were carried out during the year:— (1) Superannuation Act: Medical examinations 22 Assessments without medical examinations 22 (2) Sick Pay Scheme: Medical examinations 41 Assessments without medical examinations 26 (3) Other Medical Examinations 5 HOUSING Number of new houses erected during the year by:— (a) Local Authority 268 (b) Other Local Authorities Nil (c) Other bodies or persons 202 15 With State assistance (included in above totals) :— (a) Local Authority 268 (b) Other Local Authorities Nil (c) Other bodies or persons Nil 1.

Thirty-five samples of new milk, procured from one farmer, were found to be deficient in fat. There was no evidence of added water and the fat deficiencies appeared to be due to seasonal conditions over which the farmer had no control. A letter of advice was sent to him. Four samples from one farmer and nine from another were all found to be deficient in fat and solids-not-fat. Here again no added water was present in the milk and letters of advice and caution were sent to the farmers concerned. The remaining thirteen samples, procured from four different farmers, were all deficient in fat but associated samples were genuine and no action was taken. Bread. A loaf of bread contained a piece of string. A caution was sent to the bakers. Cakes. A firm of retail grocers sold an article described as " Chocolate Swiss Roll." It was found to be deficient in cocoa and proceedings were instituted against the firm under the Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations, 1943. They were fined £5 0s. Od. and ordered to pay £2 2s. Od. costs. Fruit Drinks. A sample described as " Non-Alcoholic Orange Wine" was merely an orange cordial. An official caution in respect of this misleading description was issued. Ice Cream and Lollies. A sample described as " Cream Lolly " was deficient in fat. A subsequent sample was genuine and no action taken. Four further samples described as " Cream Lolly," two procured from each of two vendors, were all deficient in fat. Cautions were issued to the manufacturers. 19 Liver. This sample, sold as " Lamb's Liver," was found to be pig's liver. Proceedings were instituted against the firm of butchers and also against the manager for aiding and abetting. The case against the firm was dismissed, but the manager was fined £2 Os. Od. No costs were imposed. Pears. Imported Italian pears contained an excess lead content due to the use abroad, of poisonous insecticides or fungicides. An official caution was issued to the importers in this case. Sausages. Two samples of pork sausages, procured from different butchers, contained undeclared preservative. Official cautions were issued. Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1926. 389 inspections of shops were undertaken to ensure that the Marking Orders relating to certain imported foodstuffs made under the Merchandise Marks Act, 1926 were complied with. 1,801 separate displays of meat, apples, tomatoes, poultry, dried fruit, bacon and butter were examined. Verbal cautions were given in respect of minor infringements not being found so serious as to warrant more stringent action. In two more serious cases official cautions were issued— one in respect of Danish bacon falsely described as " English " ; the other for not marking imported meat with the country of origin. The Labelling of Food Order, 1953. This Order requires that in general pre-packed foods shall bear on the label a clear statement of the designation of the food and, in the case of compound foods, the ingredients. It also requires that the name and address of the packer or labeller appears. At 333 premises 1,531 articles of prepacked food were examined. No proceedings were taken but in respect of infringements found see paragraph " False or Misleading Descriptions " below. False or Misleading Descriptions. In addition to the foregoing activities which arise specifically from inspections, a considerable amount of work has been done in scrutinising advertisements and the labels of pre-packed foods, and correcting false or misleading descriptions or errors in statement of composition found therein. Corrective action during the year in question included biscuits, confectionery, spirits, sausages in brine, cereals, fruit squashes, margarine, ginger wine, imitation cream, liver puree, iced lollies, cheese spreads, tinned fruit and vegetables. 20 Special Designated Milk. During the year in question one licence was issued in respect of the use of the special designation " pasteurised " for milk processed within the Borough ; a licence also being issued to the same firm in respect of " sterilised " milk. The premises were inspected and compliance with the requirements of the Act or Regulations was maintained. 76 samples were taken, all of which were correct. Safe Milk. In addition to the foregoing, thirty-four samples of raw milk were procured within the Borough and submitted to test for the presence of tubercle bacilli. None was found contaminated. Throughout the year the staff of the Health Department have striven to ensure that the standards were maintained and, where necessary, improved. The sanitary inspectors paid 1,322 visits to 838 food premises during the year, always taking the opportunity of emphasising the need for constant awareness that particular care in the handling of foodstuffs is essential to ensure " Clean and Safe Food." Although structural alterations, improved layout of premises, modern equipment, additional and convenient sanitary accommodation, plentiful supply of hot water and hand washing facilities, are important, these improvements can only be successful if the staff are aware of the simple hygienic principles involved in safe food handling, and what is more important, are willing to observe them strictly. Although many tangible improvements in premises have been effected, there is still evidence of reluctance by staff to make full use of these facilities in the interests of clean and safe food.

Para-typhoid Fever 1 Meningococcal Infection 1 Scarlet Fever 16 Measles 2 Poliomyelitis 17 Pemphigus 1 Croup 1 Gastro-enteritis 4 Chicken pox 1 German Measles 1 Mouth Infection 1 Diarrhoea and Vomiting 2 Quinsy 1 Infective Hepatitis 1 50 DIPHTHERIA For the seventh year in succession no case of Diphtheria occurred in the Borough. DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION 1,257 children were immunised for the first time and 2,072 received subsequent reinforcing doses during the year. These figures are somewhat lower than last year's figures, and I do not consider the number of parents accepting this service for their children is yet sufficiently high to warrant any sense of security. WHOOPING COUGH IMMUNISATION 1,052 children were immunised against Whooping Cough for the first time during the year, and 219 received subsequent re-inforcing doses. It is encouraging to record that these figures again shew an increase. 28 VACCINATION 696 persons received primary vaccination and 87 re-vaccination. POLIOMYELITIS AND ACUTE ENCEPHALITIS. During the course of the year twenty cases of poliomyelitis occurred in the Borough. Of these, 8 were boys aged from 1 year to 15 years, 7 were girls aged 3 years to 13 years, 1 male aged 21 years and 4 females aged 17, 22, 23 and 33 years. Unfortunately 3 adult cases proved rapidly fatal. Six of the cases were non-paralytic and a follow-up of the remaining cases shows that most of them made good recoveries, only one school child requiring admission to a school for physically handicapped children. FOOD POISONING. Nine cases of food poisoning were notified during the year, all of which were single cases. Of the 9 cases, 8 were due to " Salmonella Typhi-murium," and in the remaining case no agent was identified. In addition to the nine notified cases, information was received regarding the sudden illness of several people on a coach trip from Enfield to the seaside. The symptoms and signs were those of acute food poisoning and several members of the party were admitted to Hospital at the seaside town and detained overnight. Cooked ham consumed en route in the form of sandwiches was suspected and Staphylococcus pyogenes, phage typed as 47/53/54/73/77, was isolated from a sample of ham from the suspected sandwiches and also from the nasal swabs of two of the people who had prepared the sandwiches the previous day. Information was also received regarding the sudden illness of several factory workers who had consumed, in the factory canteen, a meal containing salt beef. The symptoms and signs were those of acute food poisoning, and Clostridium Welchii type 3 was isolated from the faeces of three of those affected, and also from a sample 29 of the salt beef. Investigation also showed the content of the brine to be too low. These two instances serve to illustrate the meticulous care required in food preparation in such circumstances, particularly when food is being prepared one day and retained for consumption until the following day. During the year considerable anxiety was also occasioned by the discovery that quantities of foreign eggs and egg albumen were found to contain Salmonella organisms and to be fairly widely used in the Bakery trade. SONNE DYSENTERY The incidence of mild dysentery due to Shigella Sonnei, showed a considerable decrease on last year's figure, 9 cases as against 167 for the previous year, but this is an infection which is likely to recur in greater numbers at times, especially as its spread is so easily encouraged by careless personal hygiene.

A further Mass X-Ray Survey was carried out in the Borough during the latter months of the year, by the North East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board's Mass Radiography Unit. As on previous occasions the Unit operated at Halls and various Industrial premises, with even greater success than in previous years, due in no small measure to the great interest and cooperation of the public and Commercial organisations, the widespread publicity and the excellent organisation by the Staff of the Unit. The total attendance this year was 19,271 as compared with 17,766 in the previous Survey carried out in 1952-53. The figure of 19,271 was made up as follows :— M. F. Totals.

During the year a Rodent Investigating Officer and four operators were engaged on control of rat infestation at dwellinghouses and other premises and of the sewers in the Borough. The Council provides this service to the occupiers of all dwellinghouses free of charge; industrial and business premises are dealt with at the request of the proprietors who pay the full cost of any disinfestation undertaken at their premises. 1,090 premises were inspected during the year for rat and mice infestation, and of these 462 were found to be affected. 33 The total number of treatments carried out by the Department (including domestic, business and factory premises, and re-infestations) was 433. During the year the Sanitary Inspectors and Rodent Investigating Staff made 6,129 visits concerning rat infestation. All the sewers in the Borough have been systematically examined and the Ministry's scheme for the extermination of rats in sewers has been closely followed. During the investigations 644 manholes were examined and 290 pre-baits and 51 poison-baits were laid. The necessary follow-up treatment continues so that the rat population of the sewers may be kept under control. ERADICATION OF BED BUGS Number of Council Houses found to be infested 8 Number of Council houses disinfested 8 Number of other houses found to be infested 76 Number of other houses disinfested 76 Householders are urged to seek the assistance of the Health Department immediately they suspect the presence of bugs or similar pests.

The Act controlling premises in which these materials are used came into force on 1st November, 1951. Six premises have been registered for the manufacture of new articles containing filling materials. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act, which controls the keeping of a pet shop, came into force on the 1st April, 1952. During the course of the year the six premises previously licensed by the local authority were re-licensed. THE HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952. The above Act requiring fireguards to be fitted to gas fires, electric fires and oil heaters of types so designed that they are suitable for domestic use, and so constructed that without a guard there is likelihood of injury by burning, or of ignition of clothing by reason of contact with, or proximity to the heating element or flame, came into operation on the 23rd March, 1953, and the regulations made under this Act came into force on the 1st October, 1954. Each of the Sanitary Inspectors has been appointed a duly appointed officer under the Act. 38 FACTORIES ACT, 1937 A register is kept of all the factories in the Borough, and during the year 183 inspections were carried out. 1.—INSPECTIONS for purposes of provisions as to health (including inspections made by Sanitary Inspectors).

Byelaws were made in 1937 for the purpose of securing the cleanliness of any premises used for the purpose of carrying on the business of a hairdresser or barber and of the instruments, towels, and materials used in such premises. These byelaws have proved useful in maintaining a high standard in the premises in the Borough. PLACES OF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT Number of inspections 26 40 OFFENSIVE TRADES There is only one offensive trade business established in the Borough, and during the year no complaints were received in connection therewith. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. During the year, interest in the problem of atmospheric pollution continued to increase and the end of the year saw the introduction of the Clean Air Bill. This Bill is described in the preamble as a Bill to make provision for abating the pollution of the air, and its object is to implement the principal recommendations in the Report of the Committee on Air Pollution (Cmd. 9322). There has been considerable discussion and criticism and suggested amendments to the Bill, but new legislation will undoubtedly help in the effort to achieve clean air. To act as an indication of the extent of atmospheric pollution three deposit gauges with adjacent lead peroxide instruments are in use in the Borough. These gauges and instruments are sited approximately half a mile from the Brimsdown industrial area and about half a mile between gauges. Deposit gauges are used to show the extent of pollution by deposited matter. The deposits are collected over a period of one calendar month and the contents of the collecting vessel analysed. Results are expressed in tons per square mile. The gauges as sited serve as an indication of pollution in the residential areas on the fringe of the industrial area. During the coming year it is intended to erect another gauge and lead peroxide instrument in a residential area some distance from industry, for comparative purposes. Lead peroxide instruments indicate the extent to which Sulphur dioxide is active in the atmosphere. A known quantity of lead peroxide is exposed to the atmosphere for one calendar month. The results expressed in milligrammes of Sulphur trioxide per day per 100 sq. cm. of lead peroxide exposed, provide comparative data only. The monthly analyses of the contents of the deposit gauges and the daily average concentrations of sulphur trioxide for each month are set out below:— 41 Station 1. Rainfall (ra.m.) Ph. Value.

Station 2. is at the Government Training Establishment, Bilton Way, about half a mile N.W. of the Power Station. Station 3. is at the Superintendent's House, Enfield Lock, approximately half a mile N.N.E. of the Power Station. Although the results show the highest average to be at Station 1, there is little to choose between Stations 1 and 3. Comparisons have been made with a number of Authorities in the Greater London Area and the average deposits compare favourably with the results given by these Authorities. It should be realised that the figures given are the totals for each month and although this figure may appear reasonable as a total, there may be periods during that month when pollution is heavy and a large portion of the total is deposited in a short period. It must also be realised that it has been estimated by responsible observers that domestic chimneys are responsible for nearly half the total air pollution generally in the country, and cognizance of this view is taken in the provisions of the Clean Air Bill. SWIMMING BATHS AND POOL Enfield has two public swimming pools, a relatively modern open air pool, built in 1932, situated next to the Sports Stadium, and indoor baths at Enfield Lock, built in 1895. As regards the purification of the water, the up-to-date method of break-point chlorination with continuous filtration and aeration has been in operation at the open-air Pool for many years, and this gives a safe and pleasant bathing water. Up to, and including, the 1953 season, the indoor baths used the " Fill-and-empty " system, but a modern chlorination, filtration, and aeration plant is now in operation and working satisfactorily. During the winter months the opportunity was taken to effect considerable improvements to the dressing rooms by the extension of the premises, and the standard of the baths has now reached a high level. Reports on the twice-daily examinations for chlorine content and alkalinity of the water of both baths are sent to the Medical Officer of Health, and Sanitary Inspectors take samples regularly for bacteriological tests. 43 CARAVANS Number of applications received for consent Nil Number of applications granted Nil REMOVAL OF HOUSE REFUSE CESSPOOL EMPTYING SEWER FLUSHING The above services are under the control of the Borough Engineer's Department.
