TENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE VESTRY. PREFATORY NOTE. This Report concludes the first decade of the Vestry's proceeding's. The accumulation of duties which within that period the legislature has from time to time cast upon the Vestries of the Metropolis is very great, and taken in connection with the exigence of public opinion respecting the manner of their performance is more than sufficient to account for the comparatively small increaso in the Expenditure disclosed by the Decennial Statement on page 10. The interesting Report (p. 13) of the Medical Officer of Health unfolds the condition of the Parish and the ordinary operations of the Vestry in reference to sanitary affairs. Since the conclusion of the year, however, to which that report relates, and while this report is passing through the press, the Cholera has visited the Metropolis. This district happily has been hitherto but lightly visited; and it is to be hoped that the sanitary efforts of the Vestry in past years are now producing some tangible beneficial results. The Order of Her Majesty's Privy Council promulgated to meet the emergency, and bringing into operation the Diseases Prevention Acts, has been energetically put in execution by the Vestry of this Parish. Amongst their measures have been these. They have appointed an efficient Committee with full powers. They have engaged the services of three fully qualified medical men as Medical Visitors; and of three others as Dispensers. These, not being practitioners in the Parish, constitute therefore an addition, invaluable under the circumstances, to the medical strength in the neighbourhood. It was thought— and doubtless it was rightly thought—far better for the public welfare to import fresh power to combat the foe than merely to subsidize the power fully engaged' and already on the field. They have established at the Vestry a temporary Dispensary which is open day and night; and Medicines and Disinfectants have there been given to all poor enough to ask for them, who unfortunately are to be numbered by hundreds. This slight allusion to the very multifarious precautions which have been adopted by the Vestry must here suffice. Appended to this Annual Report will be found (p. 47) an elaborate Report on Constant Water Supply ; and a copy of Correspondence between the Charity Commissioners, the Board of Churchwardens and Overseers, and the Incumbents of Parishes for Ecclesiastical purposes within the Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark, on the subject of the administration of the Parochial Charities, which the Vestry deemed would be highly interesting and satisfactory to the Parish at large. Any parishioner will on application be furnished with a copy of this Report. DANIEL BIRT, Vestry Clerk. vestry Hall, Borough Road. 4 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark.

ANNUAL REPORT MADE TO THE VESTRY by the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. FOR THE YEAR ENDING LADY-DAY, 1866. Mb. Chairman and Gentlemen, Having now arrived at the end of the first ten years of your labours as Vestrymen, let us pause and take a retrospective view of the way we have come, contrasting the present condition of the Parish with its condition when you first met together. Ten years in such a vast work—a work of draining, sewering, road-making, and building, whereby the social and domestic habits of a people are to be changed, is but a little while. It is but the commencement of a work which will have to continue, as long as ignorance, neglect, apathy, and inherited evil tendencies are to be met with. Sanitary science has been in practical operation for the short period of the third part of a generation, to perform the herculean task of removing the accumulated evils—the growth of many centuries of neglect. The initiatory proceedings of vestries have sufficed to make daily more manifest 'the gigantic undertaking which they were organized to perform; and the public, now for the first time fully alive to the evils that exist, are apt to conclude that their origin dates from the time of their discovery, and to cast reproach and blame on the very means whereby those evils have been made patent, and to a certain extent, even at this early period ameliorated. Although we as individuals reckon our experience from a time "when sanitary reform, so far from being popular, was considered one of the shams and delusions of the day, we must not forget that Vestries, the bodies authorized for carrying out sanitary reform, have had only a few years experience from which to deduce methods °f overcoming the difficulties which they find to be considerably greater than were ever 14 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. anticipated. The developemental state of sanitary science is not calculated to lighten the duties of those who are called upon to put its teaching into practice. The laws of life and health, are, amongst the educated and higher clases but partially understood, and still less observed; whilst, amongst the ignorant and the lower classes, they are not observed at all, because they are not even partially understood. The only possible mode of preserving health is to comprehend these laws and obey them. The elements however of sanitary science are available for use, and the immediate duties of Vestries are plain ; they must insist that a plentiful supply of pure water be given to the people, that there be efficient drainage, good water closets and dust bins; that there be provisions made for the speedy and regular removal of all refuse matter; that the streets be cleansed, repaired, and watered; and that the wretched habitations which disfigure and disgrace our town be replaced by such as are fit for men to dwell in, and which they may feel some pride in calling their homes. Whilst, however, Yestries have their plain and paramount duties to perform, the people have no less theirs. For a thorough completion of sanitary work, it is imperative that the people should be willing to profit by that which is done for them, and to cooperate in producing a satisfactory result. This will requiro that they be educated in the principles of sanitary science, and the necessity and wisdom of obeying the laws of health. It was truthfully said by the Hon. and Rev. W. H. Lyttleton when speaking on the Practical Teaching of sanitary science in National Schools, "that so long as the poor are unwilling to obey sanitary laws, we shall be Sisyphus like, constantly rolling stones to the the top of the hill, which will immediately roll down again. Let then the principles of of sanitary science, the consequences of the good and evil, which flow from obeying or neglecting its laws, be thoroughly taught in our schools." Nuw, what aspect does this, and also other Parishf-s present, not only with their condition which the generation of men now living remember, but with their condition ten years ago, when Vestries had not been established! We may call to mind the thousands of cesspools which burrowed the earth, and which cesspools collected together would have formed a lake containing 300,000 cubic feet; or an exhaling surface of nearly 62 acres ; or a canal, ten miles in length, fifty feet in width, and six feet six inches in depth. Where now is this reeking, malarious mass, polluting the earth, the air, and the water ? It is being , carried far away, and by sewers so stupendous, that the like have not been seen since the days of the Romans. Where are those open ditches with which we were so familiar a few years back, the sides of which were strewed with garbage, and at the bottom of which crept in a sinuous course the black and fetid stream, here and there dammed up by some dead animal, or other foul matter ? No where to be seen ; filled up, and forming part of the highway, or other useful and innocent purpose. Whilst those sewers, which from want of fall and imperfect construction were merely elongated cesspools, have all been replaced by others constructed on efficient and scientific principles. Who is now called upon to witness the disgraceful scenes which were daily occurring at our infra-mural burials ? Within this Metropolis 52,000 interments were wont to take place annually, and the amount of gas evolved therefrom, according to a calculation of Dr. Playfair, would be equal to 2,572,580 cubic feet; and all that part of it which the soil did not absorb, escaped into and mixed with the air above. The gates of the churchyards are for ever closed to the entrance of the 15 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health. dead ; and the vaults beneath the churches, have been either emptied, or so arranged, that no longer is the health of the worshippers above endangered. Ey this step alone two of the chief agents which minister to life are no longer contaminated—the air we breathe, and the water we drink. We complain now of the want of water, but how much more serious was this want some few years back ; then it was only given every third day, and for a very short period; besides, being most impure. Numbers of houses, I might say streets, had no supply whatever, nor attempt at supply ; and, indeed, a supply of water would onlyjhave added to the nuisances abounding, as there were neither drains nor sewers. Water was obtained with difficulty, and the difficulty of getting rid of it was as great. Cleanliness under such circumstances could not be maintained. Look at the paving and surface cleansiug of our streets. They are more frequently swept; and the mud heaps not allowed as formerly to remain for weeks, aye months, often indeed, until they were re-scattered by the wind, or washed away by the rain ; whilst Guernsey granite has superseded flint for our roads, and the broad smooth flag stone, the rough gravel for our foot paths. A few of the chief streets only were watered, and those very imperfectly, and for a few months of the year. Now all the streets and roads are watered, and whenever needed. In this short and imperfect review is there not cause and reasonable ground for at any rate some little satisfaction ? Why should the good done be ignored because more remains to be done, and the goal is not yet reached ? As for myself, however, I feel disposed to treat with considerable forbearance the general impatience which has been lately manifested at the apparently slow progress of sanitary labour. The causes which gave rise to this public dissatisfaction and clamour need not here be enquired into; indeed to most of you they are known: yet, if there has been exhibited on the part of the public a grave want of judgment in not duly considering all the untoward circumstances in which Yestries have hitherto been placed, has there not been manifested also a strong desire to get rid of the evils which the practice of sanitary science has discovered, and the removal of which the health of the people urgently demand ? But, it will suffice for you, when the sanitary works now in operation shall have reached a far higher and more complete condition, that in them you fulfilled your part, and at a time when they were little understood, and their application untried. In the year ending 31st of March, 1866, the births of 2189 children (1096 boys and 1093 girls), were registered; and 1482 deaths (716 boys and 766 girls). The excess of births over deaths was 707; an excess greater than has been experienced during the last seven years. In these seven years the death rate reached its lowest ebb in 1860—1, when the mortality was 1239; and its highest flow in 1863—4, when the deaths were 1369, making a difference of 450; and giving an annual rate of mortality for the latter year of 30 in 1000 persons living. The annual rate of mortality for the year now ended is 26.' in 1000 persons living. I place before you, as I have done for the last three years, a Table, in which the weekly number of deaths is given in each sub-district, with the mean temperature as determined by Mr. Glashier, at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. 16 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark.

The temperature of the two or three preceding weeks had fallen below the average. The connexion between the mortality and the temperature is very striking. As the thermometer falls below 50° in the winter months, so do tho deaths proportionally rise. Numbers who have passed safely through this season of the year owing to its exceeding mildness, and have reached thus far into the present year, stand ready to pass away from the slightest change of temperature or other destructive cause.

The Kent Road sub-district presents the lowest death rate, 22 persons dying in 1000 living; whilst 24 die in 1000 living in the London Road, and 35 in the Borough Road sub-districts. The latter is doubtless the most overcrowded of tho three, and probably also the poorest, but a considerable share of this large excess is due to the deaths which take place in the workhouse, and to which the others contribute.

Zymotic diseases show the large decrease of 122 deaths compared with the preceding year. All deaths caused by this class of diseases are considered preventible, consequently, every death which takes place is said to be unnatural,—as unnatural as if the "unshielded breast of the victim had been struck by the murderer's knife." This statement I think has been expressed somewhat too broadly. It is very doubtful whether any sanitary means which wo at present employ, will over annihilate the poisons which produce these diseases. Some of them are found as prevalent and destructive in the healthiest localities, and in the best drained and best maintained houses, as in localities and houses that aro just the reverse. Sanitary measures, however, will improvo the health and vigour of the poople, and render them far less susceptible to the reception of zymotic poisons, as well as enable them to bear their attack more defiantly, and insure a speedier and more certain recovery; whilst under like circumstances the weak and delicate would unresistingly be attacked and die. Want and fatigue aro also active agents in the production of disease, undermining the constitution, and setting into active operation certain functions of the body, whereby contagion is more readily absorbed. Granting suitable sanitary conditions, then, the best preventive of epidemic diseases when their "waves" are passing over us, is a generous diet, composure of mind, and avoidance of excess either in mind or body. In fact, I know of no better advice than that which is attributed to Carlyle, which he gave to his household in a time of Cholera. "All we have to do," he says, "is to go on each of us doing his or her proper work, and avoiding those things which are conducive to cholera, chief of which is the fear of it." Our future prospect with regard to supply of food is certainly gloomy. Between the health of the people and the health of cattle there is a closer connexion than is generally recognised. High price of meat is a virtual prohibition of its use to tho poor. An increase in the price of food is always followed by an increase in the mortality. It is said that those well versed in the vital statistics of nations, can by the pathological results point out the years of high prices. Tho health and strength of a people depends upon the supply of animal food which they enjoy. " Well fod races have always been the energetic and dominant races." English contractors for continental railways, have found it pay better to take the flesh eating navvy with them, rather than to depend upon the weak and farinaceous subsisting native. That a fatal and wide spread epidemic should have fallen upon our cattle need occasion little surprise. They have been for a long time undergoing a training precisely adapted to make them ready recipients of this or any other pestilence. Any one who has a knowledge of tho sanitary, or rather unsanitary condition of our farm yards, and the cow-sheds or shippens which are placed in their midst, will grant that no better means could have been established to bring about the results now in operation. These sheds are surrounded by dung heaps, and other refuse matter in every stage of decomposition, with ponds which drain the whole, and from which the cattle often obtain their supply of water. Ventilation varies from excess, to want of it. These conditions, with the stimulating food with which they are fed, tho breeding in and in, and the mode of rearing calves, have brought the cattle into a highly artificial state of existence. They have become deficient in vigour and strength, and consequently lack the power of resisting disease. The Registrar General reveals a strange fact, when he tells us that the death rate of Farmers between tho ages of 23 and 35 exceed by a little, that of Shoe-makers, Carpenters, Bakers, Grocers, Miners and Blacksmiths at the same period of life. There must be some strong countervailing influence which renders well-to-do, hale and sturdy Farmers more likely to die, than the pale 19 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1865—6. faced, weary, unhealthy men who follow noxious and pernicious trades. Whilst upon this subject, I may as well state that nineteen applications have been made for licences to keep cows; seven of which were refused, either from the unfitness of the premises, or their improper situation. Should keeping cows in London be henceforth prevented, one benefit will be placed to counterpoise the evils of tho plague. And another and still greater will be, that of the abolition of slaughter-houses, so that we shall be no longer offended with their noisomene s, nor with seeing droves of cattle hurried along our crowded streets and roads foot sore and weary, exhibiting symptoms of suffering painful to behold. By examining Table No. 4, it will bo seen that in place of 46 deaths which occurred in 1862—3 from small pox, there were only 6 registered in 1865—6. There have been 64 fewer deaths from scarlatina in 1865—6, than in 1864—5 ; to diarrhoea are attributed 85 deaths, the largest number which have happened in 5 years. The summer months July, August, and September produce more than half the deaths which have followed from this disease. As the temperature rises above 60°, so do the deaths increase in equal proportion. As the deaths from this disease have risen during the past year so high as to exceed the highest number that has been registered during five years by 26, and the lowest by 52, it will be interesting and useful to try and find out the cause. Now we are told, that the weather of the summer quarter was remarkable. That although the temperature of July was 2°.4 above the average of 94 years, yet tho temperature of the month of September in which "the sun no longer rises to the same height, and no longer shines so many hours," was higher than the temperature of July. In addition, fogs and dews were prevalent on twenty days, whilst the rain fall was scanty. No instance of so warm a September has been noticed since 1771. The temperature of the six months from April to September exceeds any on record since that date. " The year had in it something of a tropical character."* The deaths from fever in 1864—5 were 128; in the year 1865—6, they havo fallen j to 51. This epidemic which has raged so long, and so generally, is at last subsiding; to be replaced doubtless by some other. A change in opinion with reference to the mode of treating fever patients is rapidly taking place, and mainly owing to the strenuous endeavours of the Physicians of the Fever Hospital. They say that all the poor afflicted with fever should be sent off at once to the Fever Hospital, and for these reasons:—that the public will be thereby protected from the spread of contagion; that tho sick have a fairer chance of recovery; and besides, that there is less risk to the attendants, they at the Hospital having become accustomed to the fever atmosphere. All the attendants there, however, take the fever, and some more than once. Within the period of the last three months of 1863 there were suffering from fever tho Resident Medical Officer and two Assistants, with four nurses. Well might the Secretary exclaim that "the proportion of the casualties among those whose humane vocation it is to grapple with disease, exceeds that of the battle field." This does not say much for the acclimatisation to the polluted air of a Fever Hospital. With reference to mortality a writer of considerable experience at Liverpool has given it as his opinion that a much lower rate of mortality prevails amongst people treated in their own homes. This opinion is by no means limited to one. But so many families * Quarterly Report of the Registrar General, No. 67. 20 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. live in one house; so many of a family in one room; so many pass in and out as visitors, that from one solitary case the disease might be carried far and wide. The chances of recovery of a solitary case, may not be put in comparison with the mischances entailed. General Hospitals were formerly, and are by many now considered as preferable for the treatment of fever, the cases being scattered up and down the various wards. In a report published of the patients treated in Guy's Hospital during 1863, it is there stated, that there was no instance during the year of the fever extending to other patients, or attendants, and that the patients had a better chance of recovery owing to the dilution of the fever emanations. But in the Charing Cross Hospital just the reverse happened ; the fever spread to the neighbouring patients, carried off one of tho sisters, and in fact caused such consternation that the whole floor of wards was closed, and thoroughly cleansed. Wherever and however fever may be treated, one thing is essential—full and free ventilation. In the Irish famine fever of 1846—7, the rate of mortality in Hospitals and Poor Housos was far greater than amongst those who lay where strickon down, in the open air, along the hedge side, exposed to all the influences of the weather. There are plenty of the like instances on record. TABLE No. 5. LUNG DISEASES, INCLUDING PHTHISIS. 1861—2 1862-3 1863-4 1864—5 1865—6 Phthisis 194 197 222 181 202 Bronchitis 108 139 203 177 132 Pneumonia 78 94 106 130 119 From epidemics, which happen only at intervals, I would call your attention to lung diseases, the mortality from which, although far greater, yet do not excite attention, because of their permanence and regularity. Phthisis has proved fatal in 202 cases ; tho greatest mortality experienced in 5 years, except that of 1863—4 ; 95 of tho 202 were between 20 and 40 years of age ; and 64 between 40 and 60. Bronchitis, which smites chiefly the aged, has caused 132 deaths; and pneumonia, which destroys tho other extreme of life, 119. Of the former 59 were 60 years and upwards; and 92 of tho latter were under 5 years of age. Forty one deaths have been caused by violence, privation, &c. Eight infants wero found suffocated in bed, their ages ranging from 3 weeks to 4 months. An infant was found dead in Bland Street, and another in the grounds of Bethlem Hospital; the cause of death was not known. An infant was found murdered; and a female, aged 38, died from tho effects of a kick upon the stomach, against the perpetrator of which, a verdict of wilful murder was returned. A male, aged 60, fell down in the street and injured his brain. A female, 73, fractured her skull by falling down stairs, as also did a male child, aged 2 years. A female, 49, died from an injury which she received on the back of her head. Another, aged 28, fell out of bed, and died from congestion ; also, another of the same ago fractured her spine, by falling against a stove whilst in a fit. A female, 35, was suffocated by falling upon the floor whilst in a fit. A male, 59, dislocated the upper part of his spinte, whilst driving beneath the archway of the Fever Hospital. A female, aged 5, was burnt from her Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1865—6. 21 clothes taking fire ; as also were a boy and a woman. A female, 53, was scalded to death by falling into a copper of boiling water. A male, 23, died from fracture of the ribs, being pushed against a form. A fomale, 40, was suffocated by the escape of gas from tho main pipe of the Phœnix Company. A male, 46, died from the effects of a fracture of tho thigh and pelvis, by falling from a window. A female, aged 9, was killed by being run over. A. female, 63, was blown off a ladder by gunpowder, whilst escaping from a fire. A female, 46, died from an overdose of colchicum. A female, aged 60, and a male 20, cut their throats. Five deaths are attributed to self-destruction by hanging; tho eldest having arrived at the age of 66 ; and the youngest, a boy of 13. Last year I was unable, owing to the death of Dr. E. D. Thompson, F.R S., to place before you the analysis of the waters of the Southwark and Lambeth Companies, which were made monthly and roported by him. This duty has beon undertaken, and is now carried on by Professor Frankland, F.li.S., from whose Tables I have selected tho one which follows, and which alone concerns us. TABLE No. 6.

Above the source from whence the Water Companies draw their supplies, the filth and refuse of about three quarters of a million of people are poured into it, "Opposite," says Mr. Menzies, " the mouths of large drains are banks of putrid mud and filth, in some places five feet deep. From a town of 6000 inhabitants, the solid parts of the sewage recently deposited might be seen floating four miles from the town." Not only is such a state of our drinking water disgusting, but it is also full of danger to health and life. There is a significant statement made by Dr. Farr in his Letter to the Registrar General on the causes of Death in England in the year 1861. He says "That the whole of the South Midland Division, which sends its waters down to London, was infested by the fever, to a much greater extent than London itself; and the waters from fever districts are not always free from fever leaven."' It was about this time that tho fever epidemic commonced in 22 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. don, and, who can say how far the waters which rolled down the bed of tho Thames, contributed to that commencement, acting as a spark to gunpowder. In 1860 the deaths from fever were 1392; in 1861, 1770; in 1862, 3598; in 1863, 2892; in 1864, 3689; and in 1805, 3262. The lowest death rate in 10 years from fever was in 1860; the period when fever was so prevalent amongst the towns on the banks of the Thames; in two years the deaths had increased by 2206. The belief is gaining ground, that if pure water could be obtained for drinking, either by preventing its admixture with sewage, or anyhow by having the sewage at once disinfected, that one cf the fatal fevers which now harass and destroy tho people might be abolished.* TABLE No 7.

Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1805—6. 23 The above table points out the streets in which deaths from the principal zymotio diseases, and also those from dentition and convulsions have occurred. 11 deaths from these causes are referred to Tower Street, 10 to Lansdowne Place, 9 to Herbert's Buildings, 8 to Lant Street, 8 to Webber Row, 7 to London Road, 7 to Southward Bridge Road, and 6 to Green Street. The most wretched place as regards its sanitary condition and the state of the occupants amongst the above, is that called Herbert's Buildings, and there the proportion of deaths has been largest. As a general rule this will be found to be the case. Given, a poverty stricken, neglected, squalid locality, there you will have the greatest prevalence of disease, and the highest mortality. Now, however, and in right good earnest, the building of suitable habitations for the lower class of the community is being discussed, and will I hope soon pass into active operation. Heretofore, more attention has been given to erecting and endowing Hospitals for the cure of the sick, rather than in endeavouring to prevent sickness by destroying the miserable dwellings in which it was bred and fostered. The very foundation of our sanitary structure depends upon the right housing of the poor; and the only attempt thus far to bring about this result has been to patch up and repair the pre- See page 26.

In many of the districts of this metropolis, between 60 and 70 per cent. of the population are compelled to live in one small overcrowded room, and in which every domestic operation has to be carried on ; in it birth and death take place; there plays the infant, and there lies the corpse ; it is lived in by day and slept in by night; weekly it is filled with the nauseous reeking steam from the wash-tub; and for days kept damp and miserable with the drying clothes ; it has also to serve as a recreation ground for the children. Such, now, is the home of multitudes of our toiling population. A little way on in the future, the home will present a brighter and more cheering aspect. In that home there will be sufficiency of light and ventilation ; efficient drainage, a continuous supply of water, and every facility for practising cleanliness ; laundries have to be established, with means of drying speedily and thoroughly the washed linen ; and, what is of very great importance, spaces have to be provided where children can play in the open air, without fear of being knocked down, or crushed to death by the passing vehicle; or, of acquiring the theory and practice of premature vice. We will welcome this "good time coming;" it is needed. For, there is growing up in the midst of our large towns a most dangerous class, and which is increasing in number and power; and is casting forward a deep and darkening shadow. This class, even in its mirth, displays a recklessness and savagery which is fearful to contemplate. The condition of this part of our population is but the result of its education, and the circumstances by which it is surrounded. Born into the world in that state where only the darkest and worst passions that find a dwelling place in the human heart are evoked and matured; goaded on by want, that terrible enemy to peace and order: life barely sustained; with impoverished blood streaming through the system, poisoning the very source of thought and action. A class ready at any time to rush and collect together wherever cause for a crowd exists; gambling in the quiet nooks and corners of our streets, often in the broad highway; living no one knows how, and sleeping no one knows where ; dwelling in the centre of the highest civilization, yet not of it; in fact, the product of that civilization, and one which civilization can alone alter and improve. Sanitary science will have much to do in this matter, and much will be expected from its administrators. Every court, alley, and wretched street which are mere refuges for crime, and nests for disease, will have eventually to be swept away, and houses built out in the open day, and in large wide streets, that all may be exposed and seen. Those who desire the prosperity and welfare of this country have an interest, and must lend a helping hand to this work. It is not the time now, nor indeed was it ever the time, when a man might do what he liked with his own; at all times it is his duty to merge his individual interests for the good of the commonwealth. Many who occupy the high places of the realm, and whose position carries with it an equal amount of responsibility, would do well to have their land freed from the foul stain of bearing houses which are a disgrace and a curse. Princely gifts of individuals must not be depended upon. Companies should be formed, not for the purpose of paying large dividends, but to help those who cannot help themselves. Justice must be done on every hand; and that is all which is required; for they who know justice and do it, are " like unto the man who sets his mill on the rock, and the river of God for ever turns his wheels."

This Vestry having, received from the Vestry of Bermondsey a communication on the subject of a Constant Supply of Water, and having referred it to the Sanitary and Sewers Committee for consideration and a Report thereon; the Committee presented the following (prepared by Mr. Rendle, a member of the Committee), which was received on the 29th of May, 1866, and ordered to be printed in the Annual Report of the Vestry. Mr. Churchwarden Saunders, Mr. Rendle and Mr. Sandall were at the same time appointed to attend on behalf of the Vestry, any meetings that might be held with a view to promote a Constant Water Supply. REPORT. The question of a constant water supply, arising out of a communication from the Bermondsey Vestry, and referred to the Sewers Committee, has been considered. No doubt, with a practically unlimited supply of water from its sources, apparatus of adequate strength, and with reasonable thought and care on the part of the people, a constant supply would be a very great boon indeed. It is stated that 30 gallons per individual are now supplied; and notwithstanding the assertion of the Southwark "Water Company's engineer that half this quantity would be enough, it may be considered to be not really too much, when we take into account the various uses for which the water would be required ; viz., drinking, personal cleansing ; washing clothes, house, and drains; for cooking, and for the modern water-closet, which alone requires a very large supply. It cannot however be pretended that anything like this amount is supplied to each indi vidual. The 28 or 30 gallons referred to, include the supply to manufacturers and others, who use large quantities, and to individual persons and families who use or waste a quantity much in excess of this average. It comes, in fact to this, that very large numbers of persons especially those in the poorest, unhealthiest, and most uncleanly districts, are in every sense very badly and insufficiently supplied. Probably in some cases the main-pipes leading to these densely-inhabited districts are inadequate, that branch-pipes to groups of houses 48 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. or to single houses are insufficient or altogether absent, or that the water is turned on much too short a time. Inspections made in this parish within the last year have shown that in numbers of cases the poor have no water receptacles, properly so called, at all. In others they have as makeshifts, tubs, jars, barrels—wholly unsuited for the purpose; these, moreover, kept in overcrowded and uncleanly living rooms, or in extremely filthy yards. In others, that there are receptacles, in bad repair, or more or less rotten and tainted. In most cases these receptacles are without covers, notwithstanding they are almost necessarily placed in situations full of offensive emanations; or where they must, in various ways, receive dust, smoke, and the like. To show the almost impossibility of keeping water reasonably pure in the receptacles in use, let it be again noted and never forgotten, what kind of receptacles are usually in use among the poor; that they are generally placed of necessity near to closets, privies, dustheaps, untrapped sinks, open drains, and in filthy sloppy yards—that from these and other causes it is almost impossible to keep water other than in a tainted atmosphere. The full force and vital consequence of this argument will be understood, by calling to mind how largely water absorbs deleterious and other gases. 1000 gallons of water are known to dissolve at the common temperature— 46 gallons Oxygen 25 ,, Nitrogen 2500 ,, Sulphuretted Hydrogen, a sewer and privy gas productive of fever. 1000 ,, Carbonic Acid 500,000 ,, Ammonia, a product of animal decomposition, as in urinals. The result of all this is, among the poor especially, that the supply is very impure indeed; and in quantity it does not perhaps exceed, on the average, five gallons per individual among this class of people. This, whether a little more or less, is altogether inadequate ; consequently filthy houses and filthy habits, and the result of these, disease, personal degradation and neglect. It should further be noted that on the Sunday, when the working classes can especially spare time for cleansing, there is virtually no water supply at all. This has been by them often and very bitterly complained of. The Edinburgh Revieiw says: "Wherever the blame of inadquato supply to the London poor may rest, and it appears to rest more with the proprietors than the water companies, the undeniable fact is that, notwithstanding the vaunted 26 gallons per head per diem declared to be furnished to Londoners, thousands of the poor get but little of it directly any day ; and none at all on Sundays." The Committee may, perhaps, in connection with present or expected disease, be permitted a few practical remarks, not altogether wide of the subject. Cholera may arise from a tainted air, but it has over and over again been proved to arise from unclean drinking water; and as this parish has in times past suffered more than 2,000 deaths from epidemic cholera and diarrhoea, the purity and sufficiency of water supply and storage are of the highest consequence. The purity of the supply is not even now as it ought to be. The brown earthy matter formerly suspended in the water received in the London butts before the sewage was Report on Constant Water Supply. 49 charged into the Thames, was not in any way so unwholesome, so dangerous, as the late apparently comparatively clean supply taken from sources into which sewage has been permitted to flow. Notwithstanding all the expense incurred by the ratepayers of London to insure the purity of their part of the river, the condition of the upper Thames, from which the drinking water is chiefly obtained, is still much too foul to be safe. No less than 56 towns in the basin of the Thames above Chelsea still cast their impurities into the river. London has, the Committee think, a claim, after its great sacrifices, to be protected from this abomination. The danger of using water tainted with sewage, even in a very slight degree is great. In this district, partly in this parish, a conclusive investigation upon a large scale, has shown how true this is. In 1849 and 1854, in a given population, part supplied by the Southwark Company, part by the Lambeth Company, and in the same streets, the epidemic deaths were as follows—Lambeth Company, 1849 (impure supply containing sewage,) deaths, 1,925; 1854 (pure supply,) deaths, 611—i.e., 37 in 10,000 living. The Southwark Company, 1849 (impure supply, and containing sewage,) deaths, 2,880 ; 1854 (still impure supply, and still containing sewage,) deaths, 3,476—130 in 10,000 living. These figures should be well noted, for they mean thousands of unnecessary deaths. In Oxford, in 1832, the district of St. Clements had its supply from the sewage-receiving stream. The cholera cases were 74. In 1849, with pure water from the Headington springs, there were but three cases. In 1854 there were 18 cases—still a small number in comparison with the rest of Oxford. In the city gaol, 1832 and 1849, there were no cases; in the county gaol, 1832, there were two cases, in 1849, 14 cases. In 1854 the city gaol was again quite free of cholera, and nearly so of diarrhoea ; while the county gaol, admirably managed, and not far from the other gaol, was again attacked, and 25 cases of cholera and diarrhoea occurred. It was now discovered that a nearly stagnant millpond and a drain from the prison ran into the stream, within ten feet of the supply pipe for the prison use, from which place the kitchen coppers were supplied, and the soup and gruel made. The supply pipes were at once cut off, and during the rest of the epidemic time but four cases of cholera and diarrhoea occurred, not one of which was fatal. The requirements to be considered in connection with water supply are, that it should be sufficient, and that it should be pure. The supply will certainly be far purer under the constant than under the intermittent system. From what we observe as to the almost universal unfitness of the means of storage among the poor, some of the conditions being probably more or less irremovable—its usually unclean situation and conditior , and from the dangers resulting from the use of impure water, it is no doubt in the highest degree desirable to have a constant supply, and that this should, if possible, be compassed at any reasonable cost. The question of an efficient supply upon this system depends it is said, mainly upon the prevention of waste. Waste is very great indeed under the present system, and it might very probably be found, that very little increased waste would occur under the new—some competent witnesses say it would be actually much less. It is said, upon good authority, that half the water supplied in London is wasted; in Glasgow, 15 gallons out of 39; in Birmingham, so much, that it is considered water could, but for this, be supplied at half or a third of the present cost. 50 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. To abate this presumed waste, water-meters are used in many places—about 500 in Glasgow. No doubt, as usual, a greater demand would lead to the discovery of a cheap and efficient apparatus. * Mr. Manwaring, of Southampton, has a cheap and simple one for water-closets'; and there is one not very cheap and not very simple, in use for drinking purposes, in this and other parishes. The advantages of a constant supply are enormous. The poor would certainly obtain their quantity, which they now rarely if ever do; and if supplied within the house it is not at all probable that there would be much waste. The evidence as will be seen at the end of this paper is, that even out of the house, increased trust begets increased care, and the people so supplied all say there is no waste to speak of. In answer to the application of the Bermondsey Vestry, the Southwark Company sent a report which, at the first sight, appears to be a complete condemnation of the constant system. The statement of the engineer is, to say the least of it, very curious when compared with the answers from the officials of the various localities enjoying the benefits of a constant supply; and it appears still more inconsistent with his own evidence on another occasion. He now says a constant supply cannot be—that it is a failure. They say, "We have enjoyed it for years, and it answers admirably." The result, Mr. Quick says, of the whole evidence coming from different localities, and arising under a great variety of circumstances and conditions is conclusive against the system. It must, however, be recollected that he is the professional advocate of the water company. Wherever the experiment has been tried, he says, it has entailed the greatest inconvenience on both the companies supplying and on the consumers. "In no single instance," he says, " it is believed has it succeeded in giving a really constant supply." "In the towns of Bristol, Croydon, Dover, Wolverhampton, Preston, Woolwich, Rugby, and others, where the works have been laid out with every provision to meet the requirements of a constant supply, it is found that, either from wilful or accidental waste, the system has proved more or less completely a failure, after entailing upon the ratepayers an enormous expenditure." Already from Preston, Croydon and Worthing have denials and explanations come, rendering it more than difficult to Understand Mr. Quick's adverse, but not disinterested statements. Such are the leading points in Mr. Quick's report sent to the Bermondsey Vestry. It does not, however, appear that Mr. Quick, the Southwark Company's engineer, was always quite so confident as to the impracticability of the constant system. In his evidence to the Board of Health, he states the waste, under the intermittent system, as tested in an instance or two by himself, to be thrice the quantity used; that the water in butts and cisterns is liable to become tainted, unless they are properly situated and attended to. In one case of constant supply, in which he was himself concerned, he says the difference was very great in favour of the new mode—there was no more quarrelling for water. The advantage was so great that increased rents could easily be obtained; and he thinks the advantage might be extended not only for the benefit of the people, but for the company also. There were difficulties, he said, but they were manageable. These are perhaps the reasons why his own tenants have in one parish been for years supplied on the constant system without cisterns. He certainly advised cisterns, but then he is careful to explain that they were not to be reservoirs, but only to prevent waste at low levels. The water, he said, when exposed to a tainted atmosphere, becomes tainted, but taken direct from the main, it is very pure. Report on Constant Water Supply. 51 Now lately, as we know, a new arrangement has been come to in London in connection with fires. An extensive establishment is in process of formation, and a tax is levied to maintain it. The constant supply of water is of the greatest importance in connection with this question. If all be true that is in evidence, and the evidence appears to be of the best, then the question of preventing or putting out fires is comparatively cheap and easy if you only connect it with a constant water supply. The great objections put forth by the water companies against the constant system appear, according to the evidence, to be connected rather with the ease and profit of the companies than with any public good, or even with the question of our getting our money's worth. What occasion have we to consider these people? They in no way consider us; they break up our best streets without need; they stop our traffic; they appear to use but little forecast to put down their pipes when we are making anew our roads, but too often immediately tear them up again. They stand upon the bond, upon the Act of Parliament made under different circumstances. The tearing up that grand new street, the Southwark-street, was a vile bit of business. Let us see whether, having to pay a fire rate, the time is come to adjust our water supply, and our water rate; and, if so, then must we at once organise, for this purpose, a working committee of the London "Vestries. The evidence appears to be clear enough. Mr. Martin, in 1850, resident engineer of the Wolverhampton Waterworks, says: "The jet-pipe of the constant service was, by its ready application and great force of water, the means of preserving a large amount of property from destruction; and satisfactory experiments were afterwards made for a Birmingham fire office." Mr. Storrat reports of Paisley:—"It is scarcely possible to burn a house, the flow of water is so great and continuous—an ordinary floor of a house can be filled in ten minutes. In nine fires out of ten, if fire-plugs are placed at convenient distances on the mains, fire engines will be very seldom required." Fires, of course, get sometimes out of control, by reason of the time it usually takes to get water to act upon them. A little, well scattered, would at first suffice; leave it a little longer, there would be enormous waste with little good—with sometimes more harm than good. In London it takes, on the average, about 30 minutes to get the water to the fire ; on the constant system it could be brought to bear within five minutes upon it. To use the auctioneer's words, in such a case as this, ''Time is the essence of the contract." Mr. Gale, of Glasgow, says:—"In the event of fires, the water is constantly at hand ; the plugs may be opened without delay, and the supply, with such pressure as there is in Glasgow, Stirling, or Kilmarnock, has a better effect than engines. Fires have," he says, " in this way been put quite out before the arrival of the ongines." Mr. Baddeley, inspector to the Society for the Protection of Life from Fire, says:—" Of 838 fires in my list, with the means of supplying water immediately, two-thirds would have been stopped at once. On the south [of the Thames, there is constant delay; and with a 'spreader,' very little water used early would suffice." Mr. Quick's evidence is conclusive in favour, his present adverse views forwarded to the Bermondsey Vestry notwithstanding. He says hose may be attached to the main in less than a minute, and that when attached it would be far before any engine—jets from a 20-inch main would deliver water in a continuous stream 70 feet high. The smallest street, he says, might have a 3-inch main, affording one jet which would deliver 40 feet high—equivalent, that is, to a 52 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. power of one engine and twenty men always in readiness at almost every house door, to act at one minute's notice in case of lire. Mr. Braidwood was of opinion that to have water on night and day in all jnains and services would be a great advantage as to fires; and he complained of the great want of water in time of need, in South London especially. Mr. Newlands, of Liverpool, says:—"Serious fires are now seldom heard of, for before the flames can gain head the jets can generally be played upon them ; and this early time is the only time there is a chance of subduing them." No doubt, in the case of warehouses filled with inflammable matter, even this might not succeed as we could wish; but even here, water in time, in continuous flow and powerful jet, must be better than water not in time. At Hamburgh, in 1842, 2,000 houses and public buildings were destroyed in a three days' fire. Mr. Lindley, the civil engineer, who chiefly rebuilt the city, .will tell us how they profited by the lesson. After that, let us hasten to profit by it also. "Throughout the whole length of the pipeage are placed, at intervals of 40 yards, fire-plugs of three inches clear diameter. A jet can be applied in two minutes. The power of eight engines may thus be anywhere applied as quickly as the hose can be screwed on; and it may be introduced inside the house where the fire is. Fires have happened repeatedly in the part of the town rebuilt, but they have all been put out at once. If they had had to wait, the usual time—twenty minutes or more—for engines and water, they would probably have led to extensive conflagrations. The effect of this rapid extinction of fires has brought another matter to light to the citizens of Hamburgh. The greater portion of the fires they found to be the work of incendiaries for the sake of insurance money. A person is absent, smoke is seen, the alarm is given, the door is forced open, the jet is applied, and so the fire is extinguished immediately. Now are discovered, the arrangements made for the spread of the fire. " The saving of money alone," Mr, Lindley says, " by the prevention of fires, would be worth the whole expense of the like arrangement in London. " And in connection with the same arrangements the jet is used in Hamburgh for watering the streets at a charge of Id. per foot frontage per annum." Mr. Gale (Report on Water Supply) says,—" As to the adoption of a constant supply in preference to an intermittent one, I think there can be but one opinion; and I feel satisfied that no one having had the experience of the former would ever think of falling back on the latter. The reasons are obvious—1st. It is less expensive in the annual outlay, fewer hands being required. 2nd. The water is less disturbed in the pipes, and is introduced into the houses in a fresher state than if allowed to stagnate in pipes and cisterns. 3rd. There is no necessity for tenements being supplied with tanks and cisterns (except, perhaps, in the case of water-closets). Lastly, in the event of fires, the water being constantly a' hand, the plugs may be opened without delay. In some cases—in many cases—the use of fire-engines would be entirely dispensed with, as the fire would often be crushed out at the very beginning." The Bermondsey Vestry, after Mr. Quick's condemnatory report, very wisely sought information literally at the fountain head. The answers from Manchester, Nottingham, Derb) Durham, Leeds, Glasgow, and Dundee, in which places the constant supply is in use, are very clear indeed as to the advantages of the system, and as to its complete success. chester—" The advantages of this system over any other are too obvious to require enuw^' ation ; it has been for many years in full and satisfactory operation within this citj ■ Report on Constant Water Supply. Nottingham—"The supply for 120,000 persons is constant, and is most efficiently given— invaluable in cases of fires." Derby—" Far more convenient than the intermittent supply." Durham—" Tho inhabitants of this city have a constant supply of water from the water company, found to be the most convenient for all parties, and efficient in its operation. The intermittent system would give great dissatisfaction here." Leeds—" We hope never to have resort to the intermittent supply again." Glasgow—" We have a daily supply of 20,000,000 gallons among 400,000 persons. It is really and literally constant, and is of the greatest convenience and advantage to all classes. W e afford a conclusive refutation of the doctrines propounded by the engineer of the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company." The Leeds correspondent strongly recommends the serious consideration of Mr. Bateman's plan of a supply from Wales. Dundee—" Our supply is constant night and day. I never heard of any inconvenience to company or consumers." Ashton-under-Lyne—"Additional experience has only more deeply confirmed the opinions as to the importance and economy of a continuous distribution of water for domestic purposes , by which tanks, ball taps and turncock's wages are wholly saved, without anything existing in the unlimited supply system to counterbalance these expenses, except, perhaps, that of laying down larger mainpipes. Indeed daily experience is establishing in this part of England, that a constant and unlimited supply is by far the cheapest method of supplying a given number of dwellinghouses with water; and that the system is not practically attended with that wasteful consumption of the precious fluid which the term unlimited might seem to imply." It might be well also to enquire of the townspeople referred to in Mr. Quick's report, although the evidence seems so good and so strong in favour of the constant supply, that probably failures, if such should come to light, might be easily explained. It must, however, be very clearly understood that, under any circumstances, very little increased supply of water can be got from the present sources. At least a fourth of the water of the Thames at Hampton or Teddington Lock is now taken from it for the supply of London. The companies are limited to a daily draw of 100,000,000 gallons; and in certain seasons, including those when the people need the largest supply of water, the river does not contain more than four times—sometimes, in dry seasons, little more than three times—that quantity. Much work, and some contrivance have to be supplied to keep the river up to its present condition. If much more water should be required, some other sources will have to be sought. If London continues to increase as it has done, it must no doubt soon come to this. The London population is now about three and a quarter millions, and in about forty years it doubles itself—every year we increase about two in the hundred. If, therefore, we carry our ideas so far as 1900, we shall probably be between five and six millions of people; and this may be within the probable existence of some here. London is now supplied, as in 1848, by ten companies. In 1850, they supplied about 40^ million gallons daily; in 1856, 81 millions; in 1865, nearly 100 millions. The Southwark Company's engineer considers that we should be well supplied with 15 gallons per individual per day; Mr. Hawksley allows 25 gallons ; in Glasgow 45 gallons. In Liverpool they seem to consider 20 gallons a fair supply, and probably, with "reasonable care, it would be. Nevertheless, one would have more if he could easily [get it, for stint 111 w a^cr mcans a large number of very grave evils. The profit is very large and the supply 54 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. very unequal and insufficient, to what it might be if better managed. Surely, if the waste is everywhere one-half or three-fifths, some better plan might be adopted, so as to make the present amount nearly if not quite equal to our wants. One remedy which might be adopted in some cases, is to make the waste pipe where there is a sink, a very [little smaller than the supply pipe—so to compel attention. The actual cost of raising water to the tops of houses for a year is estimated at 4d., while the companies exact from 10s. to several pounds for high deliveries. There is no help for the consumer, the districts being tnore or less parcelled out among the companies. The gross revenue of seven principal water companies in 1864 was £702,059 ; the working expenses, £275,547 ; the profit to pay dividends, interest, &c., £404,585. For this money they are said to supply 108,000,000 gallons to 470,000 houses, through 3,290 miles of main and branch pipes. From the experience of extra-metropolitan corporations, and from the absurdity of making this first necessary of life a monopoly, yielding an absurd profit; from tho fact that it is very unequally distributed, and the poor often get little or none, we must conclude that it would be far better that private companies should not be permitted much longer to supply water, but that it should be in the hands of responsible municipalities, acting on the general behalf without profit, and so supplying the maximum that can be supplied up to the full wants of the poor and rich at the very lowest cost. Waste in the constant system is not so certain as interested witnesses would have us believe ; nor would the alteration of apparatus be so great as is set forth. The intermittent system requires larger pipes, there are sediments. The constant supply requires piping of about half the size, and there is no sediment. People would be likely to take what they want, while at present there is a great waste not observed or not controlled. Mr. Storrat, a witness before the Board of Health, was most decidedly in favour of the constant supply system, in the interest of both company and consumer, and he believed there would be far less waste of water. He said the water was so much better; it was at all times clear and cool, and the pipes, he considered, would last three times longer. It may as well be mentioned that, in case of any very shameful lack of supply or quality, a remedy is supplied by the Act of Parliament as it stands:—" Any twenty inhabitants dissatisfied with their supply may at any time memorialise the Board of Trade, and in most cases the Board will cause inquiry to be made within a month." This remedy appears to depend a little upon the disposition of the ministers for the time being. So far the minister has not shown himself altogether acquainted with the condition and wants of the lower people. For instance, one minister does not see that gasworks near a park would be very injurious or unpleasant to the people. Another thinks the present water supply is good and ample, it being the case, nevertheless, that tens of thousands of poor people in London have, for all Pur" poses, only about three gallons of dirty, more or less dangerous, water daily. For further information as to the present condition of things, late numbers of the Edinburgh and Fortnightly Reviews may with advantage be consulted; and upon the general subject, " Hughes s Treatise on Water Works," (Weale's cheap series), and the masterly and invaluable bhie J books, published, with maps andjplans, by the Board of Health in 1850. It remains f°r the committee to recommend this Vestry to join the Bermondsey Yestry and others in seek ing a constant supply, to be first fully and fairly tried in limited spaces among the rich a® Report on Constant Water Supply. 55 among the poor, and in ways which may seem to insure a successful issue, and then, if practicable, to extend it to the whole parish ; and, whether or no, at once to urge a Sunday supply in the poorest districts at least. It would also be well in the face of a possible advent of cholera to impress strongly the companies that the supply must be even fastidiously pure. APPENDIX. It appears necessary to add that several places reportod as being now supplied under the constant system, liavo been visited by members of the Vestry and officers, e. g. Crown Court, Whitechapel. 14 houses supplied now six months by water waste preventer, which has "scarcely ever been out of order." The people state they would not on any account be without it. The water clear, good and abundant. Garden Court. 14 houses supplied by a water waste preventer of another kind. The people report "they have not been really without water but once in 7 years." Osborne Court. Supplied as in Garden Court. Waste preventer, " not out of order, never." They are never without water, which is plenty and clear. New Court. 15 houses. A tap on the constant system to every house. There is little or no waste. The water is cooler and more pleasant than that from the waste preventer. This mode of supply is of course the only really constant supply preferrod by the officers and by the inhabitants, and has been 7 years in most successful operation. Nealroy's Court. 3 houses supplied by a waste preventer during 8 or 9 years. It is in very good condition, and has never been out of order. The different modes have all been so successful that the constant supply is now in full operation in 17 places. The water closets are flushed by the people, which in poor places supplied " constant" appears to be regularly and properly done. York Place, St. George's, Southwark. 16 houses reported as belonging to Mr. Quick, the engineer of the Southwark Company, who declares the constant supply system to be very expensive, and all but impracticable. His own houses here are supplied on the constant system. The water is on night and day, and has been so with scarcely any intermission for several (9 or 10) years. There are, as in New Court, no butts or cisterns. The water here is conveyed along a horizontal iron pipe 3 feet from the ground, and is drawn behind each house, chiefly through screw down taps. It is clear, cool and pleasant. The children seldom if ever meddle, and there is no appreciable waste. Water closets are flushed by the tenants. There is no evidence in any of the cases that any water meter has been in use. Complaints were made in some of those cases, and have been made in others, that persons not 56 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. resident, fetch or " steal" the water. An argument of the very strongest kind for that complete supply for every body which will effectually prevent begging, borrowing or "stealing." It must not be forgotten that the words " constant supply," as connected with water waste prevention, can only mean a partial supply, outside the house, which has to be fetched chiefly of course for drinking purposes; and which must be supplemented by some other supply for all other purposes. It has therefore no meaning at all, as standing in the way of the constant and only effectual kind of supply for every house—such as that here described of New Court, Whitechapel, and York Place, St. George's, Southwark. Except in the case of water closets, and at first perhaps not even in these, no butts or cisterns would be required, and as here shown, little or no waste of water would in any way occur ; so Mr. Quick's statement of works and expenses (Report of Bermondsey Yestry, p.p. 5, 6), can have no meaning in opposition to a really constant supply. As to his alarming exposition of the great expense of alterations; it is in evidence from competent judges that the pipes would require but little alteration; that the expense of adapting them to houses would be trifling, and that when new pipes should come to be required, much smaller ones would generally be found sufficient; and that, furthermore, wear and tear would be greatly decreased in substituting a moderate continued pressure for the sudden and frequently repeated great strain of an intermittent rush of water into the pipes.

CORRESPONDENCE. From the Charity Commissioners to the Rev. Dr. Allen, Rector of the Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. Charity Commission, 8, York Street, St. Jameses Square, S. W. 10/A February, 1866. ^ 13459 REV. Sir, Soothwabk. St. George.—Parochial Charities. The Commissioners have received an application from the Incumbent of the new Parishes or Ecclesiastical Districts of St. Jude, St. Mary Magdalen, St. Stephen, and St. Paul, which have been formed out of part of the original Parish of St. George, requesting an order for the establishment of a scheme, whereby the benefits of such of the Charitable Endowments established for the benefit of the old parish, as may be properly divisible, may be apportioned to the new parishes. The request seems to the Commissioners to be fair and reasonable; and, in the event of their receiving a sufficient application, (as hereinafter explained) they would propose to exercise their jurisdiction by making an order directing that the nett income of each Charity to be affected thereby, should be divided by the present Trustees into a stated number of equal parts, and that certain fixed shares should be paid by them to Trustees in 58 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. each new parish, who would be appointed by the order, for receiving and applying the share of that parish, whilst the control now exercised by the existing Trustees would remain undistui'bed so far as relates to the present parish of St. George. The Charities to which the proposed Order would apply are the following:—Sayer's, Robert Shawe's, William Evans', James Savage's, Edward Dudson's, S. Skydmore's, John Scragg's, Lawrence Scamp's, William Cowper's, Samuel Simmond's, William and Mary Brook's, Bernard Hyde's, Henry Smith's, Humphrey William's, William Brooke's, Thomas Grayson's, Elizabeth Belcher's, so much of Samuel Delaforue's as is applicable for the education of children in the Charity Schools in the parish, and for decayed families, Sir John Tenner's, Edward Martin's, and Mary Phillips'; and also the right of nominating inmates of the Drapers' Almshouses. The basis on which the apportionment would be made is that of population ; and, according to the Clergy List for the current year, the number of inhabitants of the present Parish of St. George and of the four new Parishes would appear to be as follows:— S. George 26,300 S. Jude 6,968 S. Mary Magdalen 9,383 S. Stephen 5,260 S. Paul 7,699 and it is proposed to direct that the whole income of all the Charities above mentioned (except the last) shall be divided into 110 equal parts, to be distributed in the following proportions, viz:— To S. George 52 parts. ' S. Jude 14 „ S. Mary Magdalen 18 „ S. Stephen 11 ,, S.Paul 15 „ As to the last mentioned Charity, viz :—the Drapers' Alms Houses, the proposed Scheme would direct that each of the new Parishes be empowered to nominate inmates in a ratio similar to that which would govern the distribution of the income; and it would probably be sufficient to direct that of the nine appointments now made by S. George, the new Parishes should each be authorised to fill one, leaving the remaining five to be filled by deserving objects selected by the officers of the Parish of S. George. Such is an outline of the Scheme which the Commissioners would propose to establish by j their order : but as yet they have received no sufficient application, to enable them to pro- ( ceed in the matter. Under the provisions contained in the " Charitable Trusts Amendment Act, 1855," (18 and 19 Yict. c. 124, s. 10) the Board is empowered to make orders app01'" tioning the benefit of Charities, the gross yearly income whereof does not exceed £30—and j by the "Charitable Trusts Acts, 1860," (23 and 24 Yict. c. 136, s. 2) this power is extended to the making of Orders establishing Schemes for the administration of Charities; j but the 4th Section of the last mentioned Act restricts this power to the case of Charities of I which the yearly income amounts to £50 or upwards, except upon the application of the j Trustees, under their hands. Correspondence respecting the Parochial Charities. 59 I am to request that you will communicate with the Trustees or Administrators of the several Parochial Charities above mentioned, and inform me whether or not you and they will sign the requisite form of application to the Board.

February 21 st, 18G6. c. 13459. Southwark. St. George.—Parochial Charities. Sir, Your letter of the 10th addressed to the Rev. Dr. Allen, the Rector of this parish has been by him communicated to this Board. In reply we beg to remind the Commissioners that so lately as the year 1862 a solemn and exhaustive investigation into the administration of all the Charities of this Parish was instituted by the Commissioners and conducted by examination on Oath by John Simons, Esq., Assistant Commissioner. It is believed that a reference to the report thereupon made by him will show that no parts of the Parish of St. George the Martyr Southwark have become in any degree excluded through their erection into "Parishes for Ecclesiastical Purposes from their full share in both the administration and the benefits of the Parochial Charities. At no time have either the Administrators or the Recipients been selected—nor are they now from one part more than another of the whole Parish of St. George the Martyr. The Trustees and other Administrators are chosen by the Yestry of the entire Parish who are themscaes elected by the Parishioners of the entire Parish i.e. of all the Parishes. " lhe piesent Parish of St. George the Martyr Southwark except only for Ecclesiastical purposes is neither in extent nor constituents other than it has ever been. With regard to the Drapers' Alms Houses (Walters' Charity) the Court of Chancery has recently decided that the right of Election of the inmates of the Alms-houses is vested in the Parishioners Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. generally of the entire Parish. Under this decision therefore all the Parishioners of all the Sub-parishee enjoy an equal advantage with the other Parishioners of St. George the Martyr whether as Electors or Beneficiaries. Since the investigation by the Assistant Commissioner, the Vestry of the entire Parish have had under consideration the appointment of new Trustees which has become necessary in relation to some of the Charities through the reduction of the number by deaths removals &c. The Vestry have decided on making application to the Charity Commissioners to vest all the Freeholds and Fundod Property of the Charities in the Official Trustee and to make Orders appointing the Vestry as representing the entire Parish to be the Administrators of the Charities. An informal application was made to the Commissioners to ascertain whether the plan would meet with their approval and at an interview between one of the Commissioners and the Vestry Clerk that approval was understood to be very cordially and distinctly given. It has not however yet been found practicable to complete all the enquiries necessary in order duly to prepare the papers for the formal applications to the Commissioners, but it is hoped that in the course of a very short time those enquiries will be so far effected as that the formal applications in respect to some of the Charities may be at once submitted to the Commissioners. The Plan proposed by the Vestry would insure to all the Sub-Parishes their due share in the administration and the benefits of the Parochial Charities and at the same time perpetuate the administration of them in the hands of the Parishioners ; whereas the division contemplated of the Charities among the Parishes would to a large extent transfer from the people to the Incumbents of the Sub-Parishes (through the absence therein of any efficient popular institutions) a patronage and power Tyhich the Rector of the entire Parish has never had nor sought. This Board therefore respectfully request that the Commissioners will comply with the applications which will now very shortly be made to them on behalf of the proper representatives of all the Parishioners of the entire Parish i. e. of all the included Parishes.

Mee, Incumbent of St. Jude's, a Parish for Ecclesiastical purposes within the Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. Charity Commission, 8, York Street, St. James's Square, S. W., 22nd June, 1866. Hob. Ha. The Charities of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. 13459. Eev. Sir, 1. The Commissioners have now considered the question of apportioning the Charities of St. George's Parish which was raised in the year 1862 and has now been raised again. 2. They think that great weight is due to the reasoning of the Yestry who urge that the Charities are under the administration of officers and of trustees who represent the entire original parish and who have no motive to favor one portion rather than another. 3. Indeed it seems to the Commissioners that a careful administration of the Charities from one centre is more likely in such a place as Southwark to lead to beneficial results than an administration from five different centres and that the former system should be continued unless it is at variance with the constitution of the Charities or unless it is found in fact to lead to maladministration. 4. You appear in the first place to think that there is something in the constitution of the Charities adverse to the present system. In your letter of the 13th Deer. 1865 you say "we hold it to be practically impossible " that the Eector and Churchwardens of the mother district can be personally acquainted "with the most deserving cases in the new districts, and we deem it our 'imperative duty to " the poor in our respective parishes to ask that the Incumbents of the new parishes and "their "Wardens, who must of necessity know more of their own districts than the Eector " of the old parish and his Wardens, should distribute under certain regulations, apportionments of the Charities in each parish. Again in your letter of the 4th instant you say "We respectfully but most earnestly " enter our protest against the proposed administration of the Charities by such a corpora" tion as the Yestry inasmuch as the Charities were for the most part to be administered "by Clergy and Churchwardens. We deeply regret to observe from the letter of the 21st " February how much the Eector cf the Parish Church has been ignored and trust the ''Commissioners will feel the necessity for an administration more in accordance with the "intentions of the donors." 5. It appears to the Commissioners that you cannot know to how slight a degree the Clerical and even the Ecclesiastical element enters into the administration of the Charities. One Charity alone consisting of 30s. a year is committed to the administration of the Eector; one alone of £4 10s. 0d. a year to that of the Eector and Churchwardens : two amounting 62 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southward. to £79 a year are entrusted to the Eector Churchwardens and Overseers: two amounting to £206 a year to the Eector Churchwardens and inhabitants: from the administration of the remaining Charities which have an income of £607 a year the Eector is excluded, the Trustees being either the Churchwardens alone or the Overseers alone or the Churchwardens and Overseers with eleven Trustees appointed by the Yestry. The Commissioners learn from Mr. Simons' Eeport, that there are three Churchwardens, of whom two are elected by the Yestry, and four Overseers all elected by the Yestry. It is therefore obvious that as regards all but the most insignificant portion of the Charities the Yestry have of ancient right, the principal voice in the management. 6. Dr. Allen on whose behalf you make a complaint, does not himself complain of this state of things. In the year 1862 he gave evidence as follows :—"I would give my opinion " everywhere that Charities ought to be distributed by laymen; for if distributed by the '' Clergy of any Churches, they would be biased to those constituting their own flock. " This is my opinion after 25 years experience." On the present occasion Dr. Allen has not come forward at all. 7. Is there then, the Commissioners would ask, any maladministration ? In the first place they understand from Mr. Simons' Eeport, that great and unusual care has been exercised in ascertaining the recipients ; that recommendations are received from every Eatepayer, and that the Trustees are divided into parties who take each a separate portion of the Parish, and visit every person so recommended, and that no distinction of locality has ever been made. 8. Such being the general system, are there any particular instances of partiality or injustice ? You hint that there are, but say you do not specify them from motives which certainly meet with the hearty approval and respect of the Commissioners. Your opponents say that none can be adduced. 9. I am here to observe that in the opinion of the Commissioners instances of individual wrong should be of a very decided character, and should be such as are apt to recur, in order to invalidate a system of administration worked apparently with care by those who apparently are under no temptation to be unjust, and the Commissioners entertain great doubts whether you can make such a case as would be requisite for your purpose. Their reasons are these : on the Inspection in 1862, the Incumbents of St. Jude's, St. Paul's, and St. Mary's, gave evidence. The Incumbent of St. Paul's was the Eev. Thomas Howlett, who joins in your present application. The Incumbent of St. Mary's was the Eev. Alfred Snape, who' also joins. The Incumbent of St. Jude's was your predecessor, the Eev. Prancis Cruse. They all concurred in saying that they had no complaint against the Trustees, or against their administration of the Charities ; they claim an apportionment as of right, and in order that the Ministers of the Sub-Parishes might have a voice in the administration. The Incumbent of St. Stephen's, who also joins in your present application, did not appear at all. No other evidence was given to support the claim f°r apportionment while evidence of the character I have before referred to was given against it. It is clear, therefore, that up to November 1862, there was nothing in the shape of maladministration. The Commissioners are reluctant to suppose, without proof, that any can have sprung up since that time. Correspondence respecting the Parochial Charities. 63 10. The result is, that the Commissioners are of opinion that on the case presented to them the reasons in favor of continuing the present system prevail, and they feel bound * not to disturb it.
