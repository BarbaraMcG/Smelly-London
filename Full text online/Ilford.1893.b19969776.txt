Report of the sanitary condition and health of the urban district of ilford for the year ending 31st Dec. 1893. To the local Board for the District of Ilford The chairman and gentlemen In presenting my report on the sanitary condition of health of the urban district of Ilford for the year 1893. I beg to state that the local population at the end of the year was according to my estimate - 15577- which is made up as fallows Ilford 12327 Doudou county } Lumate gsylum} 2300 D.barrardos} Fillage home} 950 for sirle} 15577 Bit for the purpose of the report the population of the London Country lunate asylum may be ouilted as it would not be right to include the death occurring in that illustration in the general date rate of the district because with the exception of the official, the population are more or less includes- 14040 I arrived at my estimation of the population of ilford by addiry 172 the number of birth in excess of the number of death. and 956 , the number of new inhabitation of 169 new house. put on the rate boon during the year ( allowing 4.5 persons at a house) to 11200 the estimated population at the beginning of the year - Excess of births over deaths 172 New inhabitants 995 Population at beginning of year 11200 12327 On a usual population during the year of about 11763 The total number of deaths which occurred during the year who 294. 113 of which occurred at the county of London luatie Gayer barring 181 for the rest of the district, or at the rate of 15.38 per 1000 per annum of the population or omitting the population of D. Barred fillage hour of three deaths which occurred there, the death rate for the rate of the district would be 16.46 The number of birth registered during the year end. 353 three of which occurred at the county of London luvate gsyhim barring 350 for the rate of the district or at the rate of 32.36 per 1000 per annum of ilford aloud as there were the births at D. Barrardos village hours. The density of population of the whole district to about 1.83 persons per aere. The number of cases of notifiable cufeetion diseases was reported during the year 261 namely Small pox 4 Scarlet fever 138 Diphtheria 71 Tuberculosis Croup 4 Typhoid fever 10 Continued fever 1 Puerperal fever 3 Erysipelas 30 261 of these 20 terminated fatally making a death rate from Infection diseases of 1.69 per 1000 per annum of the population 12 deaths occurred from Phthises or fit the health 1.01 per 1000 per annum. 4 Of the 138 cases of scarlet fever reported 38 occurred at D. Barrardos Village hour leaving 100 for the district of ilford this is rather a large number and is accounted for in a great measure by a scull epidemic occurring amulet the children attending birthing side schools, which was introduced by, children who were feeling after scarlet fever & cause quantity in a highly infections condition coming from plaster to reside in backing side & infections the children there the school were not closed& the epidemic was treated by excluding children of infected families from the deaths. The epidemic at D. Barrardos village hours was not of veery great exlent considering the number of children residents there. Although the above number of cases of scarlet fever secure very large & is in excess of the local board was forward, I attained considering the serious epidemic which encased in London & in suffered during the great person. Of the year, & how suitability ilford in connected with London. A large number of its inhabitants going there every day, the epidemic at ilford was of small accidents & the morality was low, ouly four deaths arranging from it; The number of cases of Diphtheria was also considerable for in a great measure by the excluding day number & insufficient flushing of the sewers, according forreverture of the sewers in the sewers to take place, and the sewers for to be gwiru off into the street. The mortality from diphtheria was also small, only & deaths according out of 71 cases. The other cases of infections diseases were small in number & do not call for an special rewarded. The member taken to present the operate of suffered diseases, were scale for" as for as possible, & the use of insufficient. Burial srounda & bake houses have been report in good savilaty conditions, but were of the stranger houses meet with the requirement of the local government board or are in any way improved services may last report. Two houses were closed during the year, as they were streturelly ma-fit for human habitation- Three hundred and twenty five nuisances were aborted, principally by improvement of solve paid to drains, such as the abortion of bell traps Ac- Out hundred & three W.C's were fitted with flushing clothes- Eight improved preened were coutrueted - Two cowsheds were improved as regards lighting , ventilation and drainage- the reward of dust during the year has been acute face today,. and I would suggest that in the next contractor be required to empty acc. the dust been in the district, at least every server or few days. A difficulty the present contractor has had to meet, has been the great diseases of inhabited houses during the year which reduced what would have been a sufficient staff for dust removal at the beginning of the year when he look the contract, quite inadequate for the satisfactory performances of the work towards the middle & end of the year- There is no serious pollution of streets in the districts so for as Throw, but some of the districts are little better than open sewer, such as a ditch at the back of the house on the right house side going down victoria Rd house shoe more near the basement shop at the bee hive- The sanitary requirements of the district at the present time are there mentioned in my report for 1892, namely the completion of sewerage system so as to include the hamlet known as the Horseshed & the beehives & Diggings- a hospital for Infections diseases & the making up of the roads on the elements estate, St hary's estate Oalplans estate ??? Horseshed which in wet weather are swam??? and can not be conducive to the health of the inhabitants ??? the houses situated in there ??? James Shimeld molt Ilford
