The Commercial Gas Company have since fixed three meters on the South side of the Commercial Road. PUBLIC URINALS. A new slate Urinal, with 3 compartments, has been erected in Mill Place, Limehouse, near the entrance to the Regent's Canal Dock. The number of the Urinals in the District is 22. The Urinals are flushed and cleansed with water supplied by the Water Company, by men employod by the Board. CLEANSING & WATERING. The principal streets are cleansed daily, and the others every second day, but in bad weather the whole are cleansed during each day. The streets during the season have been watered by the Contractors with water supplied by the Water Oompany. LIMEHOUSE CURVE RAILWAY. The works authorised by the London Blackwall Railway Act, 1877, have been completed, and the Railway is open for traffic. There arc certain matters as to giving up land &c., not yet settled with the Railway Company. GENERAL WORKS. An additional iron post has been fixed at the West entrance of Durham Row, Ratcliff, to prevent small trucks being taken through. Tenders have been received for the Painting of the Urinals, Posts, Bridges, &c. belonging to the Board with indestructible paint, and a contract has been entered into for the execution of the works. A foot Bridge has been placed across Narrow Street, Ratcliff, to connect Messrs. Baldwin & Hough's Premises, with their new wharf on the South side of that Street, according to approved plan. An addition has been made to the iron foot Bridge across Nightingale Lane, Wapping, partly in the Limehouse District, and partly in the Whitechapel District, by the London & St. Katharine Dock's Company, upon terms sanctioned by the said Boards respectively, and according to approved plans. Trial holes in connexion with the proposed new relief Sewers have been sunk by the Contractors to the Metropolitan Board. TREE PLANTING. Many of the trees in Burdett Road having died, 54 fresh ones have been planted by the Contractor, the Board paying a moiety of the costs thereof, in consideration of the very severe winter. IMPROVEMENTS. A fire having happened at the Foresters' beer-shop, at the corner of Salmon's Lane, Limehouse, and Parnham Place, the Board resolved that if the property could be purchased upon reasonable terms, the same should be pulled down for the purpose of widening and improving the thoroughfare. This was found to be impracticable, except at very great cost, on account of the numerous and conflicting interests therein. BILLS IN PARLIAMENT. A Petition was presented to the House of Commons in support of the Bill promoted by the Great Eastern Railway Compauy, for making a new Railway to part of Epping Forest. A Petition was presented to the House of Lords in favour of dispensing with the Standing Orders in connection with the Bill promoted by the South Eastern Railway Company, for the construction of a new Railway from Ladywell Station into the Crystal Palace Grounds. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, CHARLES DUNCH, Surveyor of the Board. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS for the LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Limehouse District for the year 1880. During that period there were registered in the district 2,210 births, 1,344 deaths, and 484 marriages. From this number of deaths, however, there must be deducted 54, which occurred in the East London Hospital for Children, and were those of 2 persons usually resident without the boundaries of your District. To the result must be added your proportion of the deaths of residents in your District, which occurred in Public Institutions outside it, viz., 250. Thus, 1,344 — 54 = 1290 + 250 = 1,540, which represents the total mortality of your District during the year 1880. The Census having been taken so recently as April last, and a return (though unrevised) of the result having been made public, I am in a position to estimate with tolerable accuracy the rates of birth and mortality in the District. From this return I gather that the population of the Limehouse District is 58,500, and is divided among the parishes composing the District as follows:— Limehouse 32,004 Ratcliff 15,963 Shadwell and Wapping 10,533 Total 58,500 In 1871 the numbers were as follows:— Limehouse 29,919 Ratcliff 10,131 Shadwell and Wapping 11,640 3 You will perceive that Limehouse has gained in population to the extent of 2,085 persons, while Ratcliff has lost 168, and Shadwell and Wapping 1,107. The nett gain to the District is, therefore, 810 persons. The number of inhabited houses has also increased, and in a greater ratio than the people, for while in 1871 there were 7,816 inhabited houses, giving an average of 7.5 persons to a house, there were, in 1881, 8,012 inhabited houses, which indicates but 7.3 persons to a house. The area, in acres, of the District being 576, it follows that the density of the population is rather more than 100 persons to an acre. In the Metropolis the number of persons to a house is 7.8, and to an acre 42. The Birth rate for the year was 38 per 1,000, being nearly 3 per 1,000 above the average of the last ten years. The Death rate was 26.2 per 1,000, and exceeded the average of the last ten years by 3 per 1000, and the rate of last year by .3 per 1000. The Death rate of the Metropolis was 22.2 per 1,000. The Deaths of Children under one year amounted to 24 per cent. of the total deaths, being 2.6 below the average of the last ten years. The per-centage of deaths of Children under one year to registered births was 17. 4 The Deaths of Children under 5 years amounted to 47.5 per cent. of the total deaths, being somewhat below the average of the last ten years. Our share of the total number of deaths, in Public Institutions, was 250. Zymotic Diseases caused the deaths of 329 persons, of whom 264 were below the ago of 5 years. Twenty deaths were due to Smallpox, of which number only 5 occurred in the District; 37 to Measles; 112 to Scarlet Fever; 8 to Diphtheria; 62 to Whooping Cough; 17 to Fever (Typhus 5, Enteric 11, Simple continued 1), and 56 to Diarrhoea. The mortality from Smallpox was considerably below the average of the last ten years, the decennial average being 32. Of every 1,000 deaths registered, 13 were due to this disease. One hundred and twenty-one cases were reported to me, and they were spread over the year as follows:— January 0 February 12 March 3 April 12 May 16 June 4 July 1 August 2 September 1 October 0 November 20 December 50 5 The deaths from Measles were about the average number of the last ten years. The deaths from Scarlet Fever showed a remarkable increase, and reached a higher number than has been recorded in any year of the last decennium. Of every 1,000 deaths registered 73 were due to this disease. Two hundred and thirteen cases were reported to me, and they were spread over the year as follows:— January 30 February 20 March 12 April 9 May 26 June 25 July 27 August 19 September 13 October 16 November 15 December 1 You will not fail to observe that the period of least prevalence of Smallpox, and that of the greatest prevalence of Scarlet Fever coincide, and vice-versa. The deaths from Diphtheria, which in 1878 and 1879 were 9 and 11 respectively, declined last year to a number which, however, was almost double the average of the last ten years. 6 As regards the deaths from Whooping Cough they were ten above the decennial average. Of every 1,000 deaths registered 40 were due to this disease. The deaths from Fever were rather below the annual average of the last ten years. Of every 1000 deaths registered 11 were due to these causes. Of the 56 persons to whom Diarrhoea was fatal 52 were under 5 years of age. The annual average of the last ten years was 65, and of every 1,000 deaths registered 36 were due to this disease. Constitutional Diseases were fatal to 190 persons, of whom 86 were under 5 years of age. Twelve deaths were due to Cancer; 66 to Tabes Mesenterica; 92 to Phthisis, and 10 to Hydrocephalus. Local Diseases caused the deaths of 588 persons, of whom 271 were under 5 years of age. Forty deaths were due to Inflammation of the Brain; 26 to Apoplexy; 53 to Convulsions; 52 to Heart Disease; 205 to Bronchitis, and 88 to Pneumonia. Developmental Diseases were fatal to 126 persons, of whom 91 were under tho age of 5 years. Twenty-eight deaths were due to Premature Birth; 19 to Teething, and 42 to Atrophy and Debility. Twenty-four deaths were registered from old age, of which number 18 were those of persons between 75 and 95. 7 Violence terminated the existence of 56 persons, of whom 19 were under the age of 5 years. Eleven deaths were due to Fractures and Contusions; 21 to Drowning; 15 to Suffocation, while 7 persons committed Suicide. The Seven Principal Zymotic Diseases, viz., Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Fever, and Diarrhoea caused 312 deaths, which is equivalent to a death rate of 5.4 per 1,000 of the population, and indicates a proportion of 202 deaths from these causes for every 1,000 deaths registered. Pulmonary Diseases (other than Phthisis) killed 310 persons, thus indicating a death rate of 5.3 per 1,000 of the population. Of every 1,000 deaths registered 201 were due todiseases of this class. Tubercular Diseases were fatal to 164 persons; the deathsfrom these diseases were equal to a death rate of 2.6 per 1,000 population, and of every 1,000 deaths registered 106 were due to such diseases. The Wasting Diseases of Infants caused 136 deaths, which number indicates a death rate of 2.3 per 1,000 population. Of every 1000 deaths registered 88 were due to diseases of this class. 8 The Convulsive Diseases of Infants caused 110 deaths, a number equivalent to a death rate of 1.9 per 1,000 population. Of every 1000 deaths 71 were due to such diseases. Sanitary Work, &c. During the year 1,356 Houses, Premises, &c., were inspected, of which number 1,195 required Sanitary Amendments; 329 houses and premises were cleansed, repaired, and white-washed, and 286 houses were disinfected after infectious diseases. Two hundred and twenty-six house-drains were repaired and cleansed. No less than 1,640 complaints of accumulation of dust were received and attended to, and many other matters of a nature to improve the Sanitary condition of the District received attention, e.g.—the repairing and cleansing of closets, supplying same with water, providing new water elosets, repairing, covering, and providing new dust-bins; cleansing and repairing existing water receptacles, causing new to be erected, removing offensive accumulations, animals improperly kept, abating overcrowding, &c. For a detailed list of these operations I beg to refer you to Table VI. in the Appendix. The two Disinfectors, erected by the Board, were in almost constant use during the last three months of the year, no less than 3,042 articles of Bedding, Clothing, &c., having been disinfected during that time. The total number of articles disinfected during the year was 4,615, and includes Beds, Sheets, Pillows, Bolsters, 9 Mattresses, Quilts, Wearing Apparel, and sundry other articles. The infected rooms were disinfected with Chlorine, with as little delay as possible, after the termination of the disease, the infected Clothing, &c., sharing in this primary disinfection before being removed in a covered hand-waggon to the disinfector, there to be submitted for a time—varying from 3 to 5 hours, to a temperature of about 250°F., when they were returned to the owner free of all charge. Notices were then served upon the owners or occupiers of the infected premises to cleanse and disinfect the same, the removal of the wall paper in every instance being insisted on. Two waggons were used, one for Smallpox, the other for Fever, and they were disinfected after each time of using. The bedding, &c., has some times been found to be in such a state as to render disinfection undesirable, and such articles have been destroyed in one of the Contractor's furnaces, the owner, in every instance, receiving compensation? By such precautions, carried out with care, I am persuaded much infectious disease has been prevented, but more still remains to be done. Among Sanitary reforms which I hope to see introduced, is the Compulsory Notification to the Medical Officer of Health of all cases of infectious disease. Frequently the first information I receive of the existence of infectious disease in a locality, is an intimation of a death from such disease therein. Of course, by that time all the mischief has been done, and the most that can be effected by your Sanitary Staff, after due disinfection, is to direct their attention to the locality, ready to combat any manifestations of disease which may appear. 10 In these duties I have been ably assisted by the Inspectors, to whom I tender my thanks. Another reform much needed is a comprehensive system of removal to Hospital of cases suffering from dangerous infectious diseases. At the present time the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums District Board are supposed to be only for the reception of tho destitute, leaving for the accommodation of the general public the London Fever Hospital, and the Smallpox Hospital, at Highgate. Up to the end of the year I found no difficulty in getting patients of the non-destitute class, which your Board was called upon to deal with into one or other of these Hospitals, on payment of the usual fees, except in cases of Smallpox occuring in Children under seven years of age, which are inadmissable at Highgate. In a District like that under your Sanitary jurisdiction, where the working classes form a very considerable portion of the population, it is not always easy to state which is a destitute case, and which is not. Many cases occur on the border-ground between absolute destitution and, what I may term, respectable pauperism. Dr. Johnson, the lexicographer, defines "A pauper" to bo "a poor person," and that has always appeared to me to be the proper definition. Many of the cases that came under my notice were unmistakeably those of destitute persons, and were dealt with by the Guardians, while many more occurred on the debateable ground; these I invariably referred to the Guardians with instructions to the Sanitary Officers—that if the Guardians' Officers could 11 not deal with them I would. In some cases the Guardians dealt with them, and in others they were removed to Hospital, under my instructions, and the fee paid by your Board. Now, Gentlemen, all this suggests to me Reform in the Management of the Hospital accommodation for Infectious Sick, and that was the opinion of your Board three years ago, when you initiated the question of such Reform at the Cannon Street Conference, which ended in the introduction of a short Clause into the Poor Law Amendment Act, to the effect that—"A Metropolitan Sanitary Authority might contract with the Metropolitan Asylums Board for the reception and maintenence in any Hospital, under the management of such Board, of any person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder within the District of such Sanitary Authorities." Many circumstances have occurred to prevent the carrying out of this provision, of which I will mention but two. The first is, so far as regards your District, that you could never get any estimate from the Metropolitan Asylums Board of the probable expense, and the second is the trouble experienced by that Board not in finding sites for the erection of new buildings, should they be required, but in actually holding their own against the agitation at Hampstead and elsewhere. This Clause of the Act has, therefore, become a dead letter, and I must confess that I see but small prospect of its resuscitation. It, therefore, behoves the Authorities to deal with this matter without delay, and in indicating a basis for operations in this direction, I cannot do better than refer to the words of my Report on the subject, in 1878, 12 which were to the effect that I was of opinion that such provision could be best made by some Central Authority of a representative character. On the subject of vaccination and re-vaccination I have not much to say that will be new to you. I presume that all those, except the wilfully blind, are alive to the protective influence of both operations. I am afraid that many people consider themselves protected for life by the vaccination performed in infancy. It has been shewn, however, that the influence of the primary vaccination becomes weaker as the individual advances towards puberty, and it is, therefore, essential for his further protection that the operation should be performed again at or about that period. The daily press, during the last twelve months, has brought before you numerous examples of the protective power of re-vaccination; it has quoted instances in the Army, the Navy, the Post-Office, and in the establishments of the Smallpox Hospitals and, I may mention the fact, that of one hundred and twenty persons suffering from Smallpox, who came under my notice during the year, not one had been re-vaccinated, although the great majority were of an age to have submitted to the operation. An attempt was made last year to bring into Parliament a Bill limiting the extent of the operation of the Vaccination Acts. It was proposed—"That no parent of a child should be liable to be convicted for neglecting to take or cause, to be taken, such child 13 to be vaccinated, or for disobedience to any order directing such child to be vaccinated, if either he has been previously adjudged, to pay the full penalty of 20s. for any of such offences with respect to such child, or he has been previously twice adjudged, to pay any penalty for any of such offences in respect of such child." There was a great outcry against the introduction of the Bill, which it was felt would aim a severe blow at Compulsory Vaccination, and the Vestry of Kensington having invited your co-operation, your Board ordered a Petition to be presented to the House of Commons against the Bill, which was subsequently withdrawn. Another Sanitary Reform which is bound to exercise your consideration, at no distant date, is the question of the disposal of Town Refuse. It is a question which concerns you particularly, for at the present time your District is the receptacle for a large portion of the filth of your neighbours. The reeking contents of foul dust-bins, the scrapings and slop of roadways, the refuse of markets, and of various trades are all imported into this District. The matter has already been before you, and I have received instructions to watch the action of various Sanitary Bodies with regard to Messrs. Manlove, Alliott & Fryer's Destructor and Carbonizer. I have now to report that this apparatus is in use in Leeds, Bradford, Manchester, Warrington, Rochdale, Stafford, Bolton, Birmingham, Blackburn, Rotherham, Derby, and Bury, as well as on the Continent. The Medical Officer of Health for the City has reported favourably of its working to his Authority, and 14 wo may shortly have an opportunity of judging of its capabilities in London. In July last the inhabitants of Burdett Road and its neighbourhood were put to much inconvenience, sustained considerable damage to property, and suffered a serious menace to health by the flooding of the basements of their houses during a sudden, violent, and long-continued fall of rain. The contents of the drains forced the traps, and the ground floors were inundated to a considerable depth with water, holding in suspension sewage matter. The possibility of such an occurrence proves the inadequacy of the sowers to a sudden call upon their containing capacity, and it is to be hoped that steps will be taken, with as little delay as possible, to remedy the defect. The shafts ventilating the sewers are a constant source of annoyance, and complaint in the District. From them there is a continual exhalation of most offensive odours which, though they may not carry with them germs of disease, yet produce symptoms —such as headache, nausea, &c., which, if long continued, must result in a serious deterioration of health. As yet the Metropolitan Board of Works havonot, apparently, been able to devise a method, which would combine efficient ventilation of tho sewers with the creation of little or no nuisance. 15 Cow and Slaughter Houses. These premises having been inspected by me prior to the day of licensing, and the repairs and alterations deemed necessary having been carried out, except in one Cow Shed, the licences were renewed to all but the Cow Shed referred to The Canal Boats' Act. My appointment under this Act having expired on January 1st, your Board again appointed me your Inspector. No Boat was registered during the year. Sale of Food and Drugs Act. Eighty-eight samples of Food, Drink, and Drugs were examined at the Board's Laboratory during the year. Of these, 32 were Milks, of which 9 were adulterated with various quantities of water. Nine Butters were examined, of which three were adultered with varying quantities of fat other than Butter. Samples of Bread, Gin, Whisky, Cocoa, Ale, Porter, Violet Powder, Starch Powder, Flour, Quinine, Jalap, Rhubarb, Mustard, Tea, 16 Coffee, Sweets, Sweet Spirits of Nitre and Pepper made up the remainder, which were all found to be unadulterated. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, G. A. ROGERS. Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst. Board's Offices:- White Horse Street, July, 1881. 17 TABLE I.
