AC4375 DEPT 37 Metropolitan Borough of Deptford ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the year 1952 BY J. KERR BROWN B.Sc., M.B., Ch.B., D.P.H. PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE His Worship the Mayor (Alderman F. J. Morris, J.P.) Chairman: Councillor Mrs. A. M. Ott Alderman Mrs. G. E. Green Councillor A. F. Bennington „ G. T. Blackmore „ Miss D. Burley „ A. E. Cox „ Mrs. F. K. Dolby „ R. C. Evans „ R. W. Hutson „ E. Murphy „ W. Taylor, j.p. Public Health Department, Deptford Town Hall, S.E.14. August, 1953. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting this my first Annual Report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough for 1952. The report is in condensed form in accordance with Ministry of Health Circular No. 42/1951, dated 10th December, 1951. Until he left the Council in May, Dr. R. D. Dewar was in charge of the Department. Although he was in Deptford for only three years, already he had shown qualities of exceptional merit and I inherited a staff who held him in the highest esteem. The population continues to decline but the birth rate is higher and the death rate lower than last year. Unfortunately the infantile mortality rate shows a large increase. Almost all the known factors concerned in infantile mortality are outside the direct control of this Council, but it should be remembered that in dealing with a comparatively small number of deaths this mortality rate may fluctuate over a wide range and too much significance should not be placed on a figure for one particular year. Nevertheless, it brings to our notice the fact that infants still die in considerable numbers and disposes forcibly of the attempt made by riany people who should know better, to minimise the part played by, and indeed the need for, the many agencies concerned with infant health and welfare. The year was notable for the great fog which enveloped London in the early days of December and I have enlarged on this incident in the body of the report. There were no outbreaks of serious infectious disease. The total number of infectious diseases fell from 1347 to 1193, and the Borough was free of Diphtheria, Smallpox and Enteric Fever. There were only five cases of notified food poisoning and one confirmed case of Infantile Paralysis. Cases of Dysentery declined from 77 in 1951 to 7 in this year. Primary notifications of Pulmonary Tuberculosis dropped from 183 to 134 but the preventive and curative work undertaken by the Chest Clinic at Harton Street was undiminished. The Department has been handicapped for most of the year by shortage of Sanitary Inspectors. This has naturally reflected considerably on the volume of work and duties performed. The deficiency has necessitated an undue burden being placed on the remaining officers. 2 Many important duties in the field of education and encouragement of the public have had to be neglected to attend to the most urgent and serious complaints. While this shortage of Sanitary Officers remains no attempt can be made to perform the house to house inspection, to improve in a systematic way the standard of hygiene of many food premises in the Borough which barely satisfy the minimum legal requirements and to undertake the other multifarious duties which alert and well-trained officers perform. In these early months I have been fortified by the help of a loyal and willing staff. Likewise the Town Clerk and the other Chief Officers have shown me much kindness and consideration. Finally, I should like to thank the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Public Health Committee for their support and co-operation throughout the year. I remain, Your obedient Servant, John Kerr Brown, Medical Officer of Health. 3 STAFF Medical Officer of Health J. Kerr Brown, b.sc., m.b., ch.b., d.p.h. R. Duncan Dewar, b.sc., m.b., ch.b., d.p.h.

The proportions of old or young vary in different areas and the Registrar General gives Area Comparability factors which take these variations into account. The factor for births is 0.97 and for deaths 0.98 and the birth rate and death rate should be multiplied by the appropriate factor when making comparisons with rates in other towns. The figure for population is the estimated mid-year home population. The estimated decrease in the population is 130, whereas the number of births exceed the number of deaths by 411. The table setting out the causes of deaths will be found in the Appendix Table I. The deaths are classified under the 36 headings based on the Abbreviated List of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death, 1948.

There was once again a large number of cases of measles which accounted for more than two-thirds of the total notifications, but no deaths have been ascribed to this disease. The incidence of Sonne Dysentery reported last year as occurring during the months of March to June did not re-occur, only 7 cases of dysentery and 5 of food poisoning being reported. Scarlet fever showed an increase this year, but they were mainly cases of a mild nature and in general were treated at home. Infectious Diseases.

Tuberculosis The new Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1952, came into force on the 1st May, 1952. Although the new regulations no longer require that a register should be kept, the register is maintained in almost the same form as before. All new cases in the Borough, whether or not they are transferred from other areas, are visited by the Sanitary Inspectors in order to ascertain the housing conditions and to see if any improvements can, or should, be effected. 9 The deaths due to respiratory tuberculosis in Deptford in 1952 were 20 males and 7 females as compared with 32 and 15 respectively during the previous year. Of the 20 male deaths, 6 were persons residing at Carrington House, a common lodging house for men which is maintained by the London County Council. Of the deaths from respiratory tuberculosis 14 of the 20 male deaths and 6 of the 7 female deaths were in persons between the ages of 15 and 65 years, whereas of the deaths from all causes, only about 27% were within this age group.

Food Poisoning In September, 1952, it was reported that what appeared to be a food poisoning outbreak had occurred at St. James' School. Following a mid-day meal (12.30 p.m.) on Tuesday, 23rd September, about thirty pupils and one teacher had suffered from diarrhoea and vomiting. The first symptoms occurred in one case at 6 p.m. the same day, but most developed during the small hours of Wednesday morning. 10 Only children who had the school meal were affected and not everyone who partook of the meal developed symptoms. The Tuesday mid-day meal consisted of:— Boiled pork, Pease-pudding, Mixed vegetables and Mashed potatoes, followed by Apple and Sultana tart and custard. There was no alternative menu and the only variation was the sweet with, or without custard, which did not however appear to affect the incidence of the symptoms. The food was cooked not more than two hours before its arrival at the School. It was cooked at Ilderton Road School and carried in insulated containers. The kitchen was inspected at Ilderton Road and no fault could be found that would in any way account for the outbreak. Although the kitchen had been used to prepare the food for three schools, only the pupils of St. James' were affected. The meal was served at St. James' with crockery and cutlery that was washed and stored on the premises. A boiler was used to provide the hot water and to supplement a very small gas water heater over the one sink. There seems to be some doubt as to whether the washing up water could ever be heated to the recommended 170° F. Although it is not suggested that faulty washing up was responsible for this outbreak, the two-sink method would be an advantage and the use of a chemical sterilizing agent might be more reliable than the present system which relies solely upon hot water. Faeces samples were taken on 26th September, 1952, from five convalescent patients, the staff of Ilderton Road kitchen and the staff responsible for serving and washing up at St. James' School. All these samples gave negative results. Needless to say by the time the symptoms had commenced no food was left for bacteriological examination. It can only be concluded that this was a small food poisoning outbreak of unknown origin. Section "C" SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES ETC., AND FACTORIES ACT 12 SANITARY INSPECTION Owing to the deficiency in the Sanitary Inspector's establishment for two-thirds of the year, the figures for Sanitary Inspection naturally show a decline from those of the previous year. For example, the total number of primary inspections was down by 12% and that of re-inspections, by 25%. The figures following show details of the decline:— 1951 1952 Total primary inspections 7,873 6,844 Total re-inspections 26,536 19,868 Total intimation notices served 2,225 1,612 Total statutory notices served 972 662 Total premises on which works were completed 2,495 1,709 Total improvements effected during the year 8,563 5,226 A system of priorities had to be arranged in order that the District Inspectors, with their enlarged districts, could cope with the urgent matters requiring inspection as compared with routine inspection. In the top group of priorities were Infectious Diseases, Complaints, Notices from Builders, Special Housing Inspections and Miscellaneous matters needing urgent attention. Routine inspections of Milk, Ice-cream, Fish premises, etc., Shops Act and Factories Act visits had perforce to be left until a favourable opportunity occurred. The following table will show the percentage of Inspections carried out (i) (January-April), when the establishment was up to strength and (ii) (May-December) when the establishment was 25% deficient:— 13 Inspection for Total for Year Total Jan.-April Percentage of Total Jan.-April (33%) May-December (66%) Complaints 2,560 832 33% 67% Infectious Diseases 299 121 40% 60% Notices from Builders 299 79 27% 73% Special Housing 537 197 36% 64% Miscellaneous 1,191 438 37% 63% Factories (Non-Power) 58 42 72% 28% Factories (Power) 245 199 81% 19% Food Premises— (Cafes, etc.) 498 328 66% 34% Butchers 123 60 50% 50% Ice Cream 114 88 77% 23% Milk Premises 63 44 70% 30% Bakehouses 31 27 87% 13% Fish Premises 67 34 51% 49% Outworkers 65 52 80% 20% Shops Act 646 437 68% 32% These figures demonstrate that although the urgent works requiring the attention of the Sanitary Inspectors were comparable throughout the year, i.e., 331/3 to 662/3, the routine matters, although perhaps of long term value to the community in general, suffered a serious decline. Details of inspections and sanitary improvements effected will be found in the Appendix Tables II and III, but a summary of the work is shown below with comparative figures for some previous years:— 1938 1946 1951 1952 Total primary inspections 9,505 8,609 7,873 6,844 Total re-inspections 19,968 23,840 25,536 19,868 Total intimation notices served 2,694 1,758 2,225 1,612 Total statutory notices served 824 702 972 662 Total premises on which works were completed 2,585 1,695 2,495 1,709 Total improvements effected during the year 11,425 3,937 8,563 5,226 In general defects were dealt with under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, and the Housing Act, 1936, Section 9 was only used in two instances. 14 Smoke Abatement Between the 6th and 9th December a four-day smoke fog enveloped London and caused directly or indirectly some 4,000 deaths in the London area. Between the 8th and 29th December, there were 45 deaths in Deptford from upper respiratory diseases (bronchitis, pneumonia, etc.) as compared with two for the corresponding period last year. Deaths from these causes continued to be much higher than the average until March, 1953, and were undoubtedly the consequence of serious lung damage sustained in December. It would seem that public opinion has at long last been stimulated by the tragedy, and the Government have set up an investigating Committee. This Committee presumably will examine the whole legislative and technical field concerned with atmospheric pollution and will make some practicable recommendations for the consideration of the Government. It seems that on a National scale several procedures should be adopted without delay. Firstly, smokeless zones should be designated and created in all our large industrial conurbations, within which all domestic grates should be of the smokeless fuel type, the open grate eliminated and all factory plants modified as far as possible to eliminate smoke and grit emission. Secondly, more stringent smoke laws should be enacted with precise legal standards laid down, more easily enforcible than at the present by the Local Authorities. Thirdly, all new buildings built either by private sources or by the Local Authority should be fitted with smokeless fire grates. The open grate is a wasteful anachronism and should be abolished. With these measures which would be progressive and expanding, a start at least could be made to solve these problems. A clean atmosphere is only a degree less urgent than a wholesome water supply, an adequate drainage system and safe food. Our experience this year has shown how vulnerable we are to minor climatic change. The position in regard to atmospheric pollution is a National—nay an international scandal, which must be faced with resolution and courage, unencumbered by foolish and uninformed prejudice or resisted by selfish vested interests. Offensive Trades There is only one factory in the Borough at which an offensive trade is carried on, i.e., a soap boiler in the St. Paul's Ward. This business has been established for many years and is regularly inspected and the work in general is well conducted. From time to time complaints are received regarding unpleasant smells emanating from the factory and under the direction of the Sanitary Inspector a great deal of time and money has been expended by the firm in order to deal with this matter. There is no doubt that most of the effluvia is dealt with inside the premises, but with a business of this nature, surrounded as it 15 is by high blocks of flats and a school, it is practically impossible, under present conditions, to deal adequately with the matter. With the present method of fat extraction it is very doubtful if any further improvement can be effected, but an alternative method is being explored, which, if successful, would almost entirely remove the nuisance. Rodent Control One Rodent Supervisor and two Operators were employed throughout the year under the general direction of the Senior Sanitary Inspector, and the following tables summarise the work carried out:— PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Report for Year ended 31st December, 1952.

This largely accounts for the smallness of the figure relating to business premises. Disinfection and Cleansing The use of the disinfector at the South-Eastern Fever Hospital (now renamed the New Cross General Hospital) was continued as a temporary measure throughout the year, the Bathing Station also occupying part of the hospital premises. Neither of these are entirely satisfactory. It is also anticipated that the Regional Hospital Board will require the premises to be vacated in the near future. The construction of the new Disinfection and Bathing Station was commenced in December, 1952, and it is hoped that it will be completed in late 1953. The following is a summary of the work of disinfection, disinfestation and cleansing:— Premises disinfected (infectious disease) 252 Premises disinfected (requests) 37 Premises disinfected (verminous condition) 479 Premises disinfected (removals) 1 Total number of articles disinfected 42,769 Books disinfected 358 Number of articles destroyed at owner's request 339 In addition to the normal disinfection a considerable amount of work was done for firms engaged in exporting second-hand clothing and rags mainly to certain parts of Africa where the clothing is not allowed to be imported unless previously disinfected. The total dealt with during 1952 was 25,463 garments and approximately 1 ton of rags. The charges for this service amounted to £81 16s. 6d. Bathing Centre Number of school children who received baths (other than for scabies) 1,109 Number of school children who received baths for the treatment of scabies 56 Adults who received baths (other than for scabies) 492 Scabies baths for adults 34 Water Supply The water supply for domestic purposes for the whole of the Borough is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. Routine bacteriological examination is not normally carried out by the Council but the Water Board have supplied information on the bacteriological purity when requested. The water supply has been fully satisfactory throughout the year. 17 Certificates in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, that dwelling houses had a proper and efficient water supply were issued in respect of 34 new premises comprising 2 houses and 32 flats. THE FACTORIES ACT, 1937 The following is an epitomised statement of the administration of the Act. The inspections, visits, etc., are carried out by the District Sanitary Inspectors.

The types of work carried on by the 122 outworkers in this Borough were as follows:— Wearing apparel (106), artificial flowers (3), paper bags (2), boxes (8), button cards (1), and shuttlecocks (2). Section "D" FOOD AND DRUGS AND REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST 20 FOOD AND DRUGS A full-time Food Inspector is employed in the supervision of Food and Food Premises. Food Samples are sent for chemical analysis to the Public Analyst, and for bacteriological examination to The Public Health Laboratory Service at Park Hospital. Details of the work of the Food Inspector will be found in the Appendix Tables V, VI and VII and details from the Public Analyst's Report are included at the end of this section. Clean Food On the 3rd November the new L.C.C. Bye-laws for the protection of food came into operation. A communication was addressed to all shops and stalls dealing with the handling of food, drawing attention to the Bye-laws and the provisions therein. Royal Victoria Yard Considerable quantities of food no longer considered fit for prolonged storage by the Admiralty, are examined in order to assess their fitness for sale to the general public. Ice-Cream Conditions under which ice-cream is made and distributed in the Borough have continued to improve. 212 premises are registered for the manufacture, storage or sale of Ice Cream. Fifty-four samples were taken for bacteriological examination. Grade I 30 Grade II 12 Grade III 9 Grade IV Nil 3 Inconclusive owing to laboratory apparatus —failure 54 Synthetic Cream During routine sampling of synthetic cream sold in Deptford, but manufactured outside the Borough, abnormally high bacterial counts were found. At the same time samples taken at the bottling plant and at the place of manufacture were consistently satisfactory. From time to time reports are received from outside Deptford indicating similar high counts in samples taken from retail shops. It would appear that although this product is made and despatched under strictly hygienic conditions the deterioration rate is greater than is generally recognised. Bacterial proliferation is rapid especially if temperatures are high and storage conditions are unsatisfactory. Unfortunately, unlike milk or genuine cream, there is no souring or clotting to indicate deterioration or danger, and this product can appear 21 wholesome when in fact the bacterial count may have reached astronomical proportions. At no time have any dangerous organisms been isolated, but obviously a product containing such large numbers of bacteria and having such diverse culinary uses, must be a source of potential public health danger. A possible solution to this problem is that each bottle should be stamped with a date after which the product should not be sold to the public. This suggestion has in fact been made to the Deptford firm, but for obvious reasons they are unwilling to act unless in unison with other bulk manufacturers. The problem is known to the Ministry of Health officials. They feel however, that at this stage official action should be left to the local authority. Nevertheless without a legal standard, similar to milk for example, and in the absence so far of any 'cream borne' disease, this Local Authority must confine its efforts merely to vigilant supervision and frequent sampling of the product. Labelling of Food Orders, 1946/50 All pre-packed samples of food submitted under the Food and Drugs Act were considered also under the Labelling of Food Orders, 1946 and 1950. In 49 instances separate examinations were made under these Orders and several slight infringements were dealt with by correspondence. Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941 All pre-packed drugs submitted under the Food and Drugs Act were also considered under the Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941. Food Standards Seventy-four samples were specially examined under the various Food Standard Orders. In two instances infringements were dealt with by informal action. Public Health (Preservatives etc. in Food) Regulations Wherever desirable Food and Drugs Act samples were examined for the presence of prohibited preservatives and colouring matters and for excessive amounts of the permitted preservatives. No action was found necessary under the regulations. Mineral Oil in Food Order 1949 Eighty-two samples were taken under the Order—no contraventions were found. School Milks Eighteen samples were sent for chemical examination and nine were sent for bacteriological examination. One sample was also sent from a Day Nursery. 22 Milk (Special Designations) Act Twenty-three samples were submitted. Foreign Bodies in Food Several instances were found of foreign bodies in food. In the main, insufficient evidence was available to ensure successful prosecution and the makers of the food in question were warned. FOOD AND DRUGS ANALYSIS Food and Drugs Analysis During the year, 502 samples were submitted for analysis under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, by your Sampling Officers. These samples were also examined wherever applicable under the Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations, 1943, the Food Standards Orders, 1944-51, and the Labelling of Food Orders, 1946-51. Of the total number, 79 were taken formally, in accordance with the procedure prescribed under the Food and Drugs Act, the remaining 423 being undivided, or informal samples. The Public Analyst, Dr. H. Amphlett Williams, Ph.D.(Lond.), A.C.G.F.C., F.R.I.C., has submitted the following report on milk sampling:— "107 samples of milk were submitted for analysis during the year, of which 78 were understood to have been taken on Sundays and 29 on week-days. One sample was reported as "adulterated," giving a percentage "adulteration" of 0.9. The average composition of the samples is shown in the following Table, with the averages for the five preceding years for comparison: AVERAGE COMPOSITION OF MILK, DEPTFORD Period Fat Solids-not-fat Total Solids 1947 3.51 8.68 12.19 1948 3.45 8.72 12.17 1949 3.47 8.74 12.21 1950 3.44 8.70 12.14 1951 3.52 8.63 12.15 1952 3.48 8.69 12.17 February, March and April, 1952 3.41 8.56 11.97 The average percentage of solids-not-fat in the 30 samples analysed during the three months, February, March and April, viz. 8.56%, is again low compared with the average found during the rest of the year. The figure shows an improvement, however, over that found in the corresponding period in 1951, when the average fell to 8.47%, i.e. below the legal minimum standard. It is to be hoped that with improvements in the supply of winter feeding stuffs this fall in quality during the late winter months which has been experienced since the beginning of the War will tend to disappear. The average composition for the whole year 23 shows no appreciable variation from the average of the five preceding years. During the year further knowledge of the composition of genuine milk has been collected and published by Dr. J. G. Davies (Analyst, 1952, 77, 499-524). Since the data have been carefully checked, and are based upon over half a million analyses, they may be regarded as authoritative, and it is of interest to quote from a Table showing the average quality of milk over the whole of England during the past 50 years. AVERAGE COMPOSITION OF MILK, ENGLAND Period Fat Solids-not-fat Total Solids 1900-05 3.78 9.05 12.83 1906-10 3.70 9.13 12.83 1911-15 3.74 9.10 12.84 1916-20 3.80 9.20 13.00 1921-25 3.76 9.18 12.94 1926-30 3.81 9.09 12.90 1931-35 3.74 8.98 12.72 1936-40 3.72 8.96 12.68 1941-45 3.67 8.85 12.52 1946-50 3.62 8.74 12.36 It will be observed from the figures quoted that a significant and progressive fall in quality has taken place since about 1920, and that the quality of milk sold in Deptford, which is no doubt typical of the London milk supply, falls slightly below the average for the whole country. The downward trend in quality is believed to be due to the breeding of cows for milk quantity rather than quality, and it is suggested by Dr. Davies that a system of payment by quality, such as obtains in some other countries, should be adopted as the logical remedy. As regards actual adulteration, as distinct from variation in quality, only one sample of milk was reported upon adversely during the year, and in this instance the indicated proportion of added water was only one per cent." In addition to the analyses under the Food and Drugs Act, 123 samples were examined under other Acts, Orders and Regulations. Particulars of these samples are furnished below: Relevant Act or Order Article Number of Samples Number Failing to Comply Nature of Irregularity Food Standards (Mustard) (No.2) Orders, 1944-50 Mustard 1 0 Food Standards (Liquid Coffee Essences) Order 1945 Coffee and Chicory Essence 4 0 24 Relevant Act or Order Article Number of Samples Number Failing to Comply Nature of Irregularity Food Standards (Self-raising Flour) Order 1946 Self-raising Flour 6 1 Deficient in available carbon dioxide.

Total123 3 Section "E" HOUSING 26 HOUSING At the end of 1952 the Council had a total of 701 permanent houses and flats, a total of 586 temporary houses of various types and controlled a further 1,432 properties under requisition. The requisitioned properties housed 2,099 units of tenancy. During the year, 20 permanent flats were completed for the Council, and 68 flats, 10 maisonettes and 10 shops were in the course of construction. During 1952, 5,226 improvements were carried out in 1,709 houses, somewhat less than last year, and outstanding works at the end of the year totalled 460. The problems of the repair and maintenance of dwelling houses were no less acute in 1952 than in previous years. The rising cost of repairs made the maintenance of old houses uneconomic in many cases. A large proportion of these old houses are admittedly sub-standard and do not provide those amenities which are now considered to be essential in new buildings. They do, however, provide "reasonable" accommodation at a rental which the poorer paid members of the community can afford. Private owners are, not unreasonably, unwilling to maintain houses which cannot possibly provide any return on the necessary capital outlay and the local authority is equally unwilling to take over all these properties which are uneconomic and at the same time leave those houses which provide a reasonable return in private ownership. In the maintenance of existing property the following is a summary of the work done in 1952:— Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Total number of houses inspected for housing defects 2,859 Number of Statutory Notices served 662 Number of houses repaired or nuisances remedied 1,709 Housing Act, 1936 Number of houses represented to the Council 7 Number of Demolition Orders made by the Council, following representation 1 Number of houses repaired by owners 2 Number of houses, the subject of Closing Orders 4 Number of Closing Orders determined — Overcrowding Number of individual dwellings overcrowded at the end of the year 141 Number of families found to be living in overcrowded conditions during year 32 Number of families who have obtained alternative accommodation during year 47 27 Underground Rooms Number occupied, but unfit 1 Number closed 1 There are many underground rooms throughout the Borough and a fairly high proportion of them, although used as dwellings, do not conform in all respects with the statutory requirements and cannot without major structural alterations be made to do so. Closure is not, however, practicable in present circumstances and owners have been co-operative in making these rooms reasonably fit. Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts Certificates of Disrepair were granted in 4 cases during the year. Section "F" PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES 30 PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES The London County Council, as the Local Health Authority, became responsible for the health services set out in Part III of the National Health Service Act on 5th July, 1948. These services are now commonly referred to as the "personal" health services as distinct from the environmental health services for which the Metropolitan Boroughs continue to be responsible. The services which are provided at the various clinics are as follows:— Health Centre, Amersham Road, S.E. 14. Infant Welfare, Toddlers, Ante-Natal and Post-Natal clinics. Ante-Natal exercise clinic. Vaccination and Immunisation. Artificial sunlight. Sewing class. Foot clinic. Rheumatism and Nutrition clinics. St. George's Hall, Shardeloes Road, S.E.4. Infant Welfare and Ante-natal clinics. St. Luke's Hall, Gosterwood Street, S.E.8. Infant Welfare clinic. Princess Louise Institute, Hales Street, S.E.8. Infant Welfare clinic. St. John's Nurses' Home, Watson Street, S.E.8. Ante-natal clinic. School Treatment Centre, Reginald Square. Dental clinic. Ophthalmic. Special Aural and Minor Ailment clinics. The County Council also maintain two Day Nurseries. The headquarters of the Divisional Medical Officer are at St. Paul's House, Deptford High Street. Section "G" MISCELLANEOUS 32 MISCELLANEOUS Canal Boats Act The section of the Grand Surrey Canal passing through the Borough was kept under observation by the District Inspector but no canal boats were found of a type requiring inspection. Common Lodging Houses There is only one Common Lodging House in the Borough. This is Carrington House which is maintained by the London County Council. This building was erected in 1903 and it contains 814 separate cubicles, for use by men only. In addition to the usual facilities for washing and bathing, there is a reading room and a smoking room. The dining room is provided with a large stove on which the men can cook their own meals, and in addition, there is a canteen which provides excellent meals at a low price. A sick bay is provided on the ground floor for cases awaiting admission to hospital. No nursing of any sort is provided but sick persons are not so isolated as they would be in cubicles on an upper floor, and serious or dangerous illness is less likely to be overlooked. The standard of accommodation is high and it compares favourably with many of the rooms occupied by single elderly men throughout the district. Laboratory Service The bacteriological laboratory at the Park Hospital is run in association with the Public Health Laboratory Service. It provides a full bacteriological service for all public health requirements and the examinations are carried out without charge to the local authority. It has the additional advantages that the laboratory can carry out the very large number of bacteriological examinations which might be required during an epidemic, and that help can be provided to assist in the field work necessary in tracing the source of infection. The laboratory facilities at the Devonport Laboratory, Seamen's Hospital, continue to be available for the examination of swabs and other specimens sent by general practitioners. A week-end service is provided here and it is rather more convenient for the general practitioner to call for a consultation with the pathologist—a matter of some importance with the increasing complexity of bacteriological examinations. Mortuary and Coroner's Court Before the war both the Boroughs of Deptford and Greenwich maintained their own mortuaries and coroner's courts. By arrangement, and following war damage, the coroner's court at Deptford and the mortuary at Greenwich have been closed. The mortuary at Watson Street, Deptford, serves parts of Greenwich and Woolwich, in addition to Deptford. The number of bodies received at the mortuary is, as a result of this arrangement, greatly increased. The number of bodies received during 1952 was 587. 33 National Assistance Act, 1948 Burial of the Dead Under Section 50 of the above Act it is the duty of the Council to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who dies or is found dead within the Borough, and where no private arrangements are made for the disposal of the remains. Fifteen persons were buried under the provisions of this Act during 1952. Removal of Aged and Infirm Persons to Institutions Section 47 of this Act provides for securing the necessary care and attention for the aged and chronic sick by means of an order of the Court. The main difficulty in securing the necessary care is in obtaining a vacancy in a suitable institution. The hospital provides accommodation for the chronic sick but there is a waiting list and admission may be delayed for weeks or in some few cases, months. The turn-over of beds is naturally very much slower than with acute cases and vacancies are consequently comparatively infrequent. The hospitals require to be assured that the patient is in need of a hospital bed, either on the grounds that medical treatment is required which cannot be given at home, or that the patient is bedridden and requires nursing care as a result. The London County Council provides accommodation for persons who are unable properly to care for themselves but who are not in need of nursing care, and who can get up and wash and dress themselves. There is at present a lack of provision for those persons who by reason of age or chronic ill-health require a certain amount of nursing care, who may be unable to wash and dress themselves or to walk without difficulty, but who are not bedridden. They are too well for the hospital and too ill for the County Council's Homes. In spite of the difficulties, both the Hospitals and the County Council have been very helpful in dealing with the many difficult and distressing cases. Action under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act was contemplated in several cases during 1951, but it was not found necessary to take action to remove any person. Services for Old People The voluntary services in the district provide some assistance and recreation for old people. The W.V.S. have organised five Darby and Joan Clubs in various parts of the Borough so that one or more is within reasonable reach of persons living in any part of the district. In addition, the Albany Institute Old People's Club, although situated just beyond the Borough boundary, is patronised mainly by Deptford people. A Meals-on-Wheels service operates in the Borough. This supplies meals to aged and infirm people in their homes twice a week, to five of the Darby and Joan Clubs once a week, and to the Albany Institute daily from Monday to Friday. The meals are obtained from the London County Council's meals service and supplied to the old people at a charge of l0d. each. The vehicle was supplied and fitted by the Borough Council, 34 which also provides the driver and maintains the vehicle. The remainder of the work is done by members of the W.V.S. Shops Act, 1934 In the course of their routine inspection the Sanitary Inspectors paid attention to the ventilation and temperature of shops and the provision of washing accommodation and sanitary conveniences. Slaughter Houses Two slaughter houses are licensed in this Borough but were not in use during the year. Baths and Wash-Houses The Council maintains three swimming baths at Laurie Grove adjoining the Town Hall. A plant giving continuous filtration and sterilisation maintains the purity of the water at all times. The plant is capable of filtering the whole of the water in the baths within four hours and the system of "break-point" chlorination ensures the purity and safety of the water even during periods of maximum use. Two of the swimming baths are open all the year, but the large bath is closed from October until April, during which time a sprung floor is put in place and the building is used as a hall. In addition to the swimming baths there are 60 slipper baths for public use at Laurie Grove. At the Evelyn Baths, Clyde Street, there are 60 slipper baths and facilities for Russian Vapour Baths and Foam Baths, and in addition a public wash-house is provided. At the baths at Ilderton Road 18 slipper baths are provided. Pet Animals Act, 1951 Six applications for licences were received, and all were approved by the Council and granted. Medical Examinations During the year 40 examinations were carried out to ascertain if people appointed to the Council's Permanent Staff were fit for admission to the Superannuation Scheme.
