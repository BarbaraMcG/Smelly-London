Since the year 1861, in the absence of any exact data, I have been in the habit of estimating the increase of the population of Lambeth and its Districts at the same ratio that occurred between the censuses of 1851 and 1861. In so doing, as I remarked in my last Annual Report, I was certain that I understated the population of some of its Districts which has proved correct. Notwithstanding an under-estimate of the population, I have, year after year, shown that the healthiness of the Parish as indicated by the annual number of deaths in it, has habitually contrasted very favorably with the entire Metropolis of which it forms so large a part; had I calculated the death-rate on the actual increased population, the contrast would have been still more favorable for Lambeth. The number of Births registered in the Parish during the year 1870 were 7715; of which 2031 were registered in the first quarter'; 1957 in the second quarter, 1874 in the third quarter, and 1853 in the fourth quarter of the year. The Births exceeded those of the previous year by 43. 11 The Deaths during the year were 4593; the excess of births over deaths amounted to 3122. In the first quarter of 1870, the deaths numbered 1281 ; in the second quarter 985 ; in the third quarter 1152 j and in the last quarter 11 75. The Deaths were 219 above those in 1869. The births and deaths during each quarter of the year in each of the Eight ecclesiastical Divisions of the Parish are shown in Table II.;from which it will be seen, that in Waterloo Road 1st part district, there were 598 births, and 334 deaths during the year; in the Waterloo Road, 2nd part district, 923 births, and 473 deaths; in the Lambeth Church, 1st part district, 798 births, and 473 deaths; in th. Lambeth Church, 2nd part district, 1584 births, and 1112 deaths, 341 of which occurred in the Workhouse; in the Kennington 1st part district, 1383 births, and 837 deaths; in the Kennington 2nd part district, 901 births, and 530 deaths; in the Brixton district, 1109 births, and 580 deaths; and in the Norwood district, 419 births, and 234 deaths, 6 of which occurred in the Children's Workhouse. The comparative Mortality of Lambeth; the entire Metropolis; and the South District, of which Lambeth forms a large part, is shown in Table III; which also gives the increased Population of each of the Divisions of the Parish, upon which the death-rate of each is founded This Table is calculated on the rate of increase between 18G1 and 1871 shown by the Census taken since the close of the year 1870, so that the deathrate for 1870 can be very correctly calculated. In the nine years from 1861, the population of the Waterloo Road 1st and 2nd part districts, and the Lambeth Church 1st part district, rather decreased, whilst that of the five other districts largely increased. In 1861 the population of the parish formed rather more 12 than one-eighteenth of the entire Metropolis ; in 1870, having increased more rapidly, the population of the parish of Lambeth formed more than one-sixteenth of the whole Metropolis. The Mortality of Lambeth continues to compare very favourably with that of the whole Metropolis; as well as that of the Southern District, of which it is part. The Mortality of the whole of London for the year, being at the rate of 240 per ten thousand of the inhabitants; that of the Southern District, 234 per ten thousand inhabitants, and of Lambeth, 225 per tenthousand inhabitants. The four most healthy districts during the year were the Brixton, Kennington 2nd part, Norwood, and Kennington 1st part districts. The mortality in the Brixton district being 171 per ten thousand inhabitants; in the Kennington 2nd part, '82 per ten thousand inhabitants; in the Norwood, 194 per ten thousand inhabitants, and in the Kennington 1st part, 208 per ten thousand inhabitants. The four less healthy districts were the Waterloo Road 1st part, Lambeth Church 1st and 2nd parts, and Waterloo Road 2nd part districts. The mortality in the Waterloo Road, 1st part district, being 235 per ten thousand inhabitants ; In the Lambeth Church 1st part, 242 per ten thousand inhabitants; in the Lambeth Church 2nd part, 254 per ten thousand inhabitants; and in the Waterloo Road, 2nd part, 256 per ten thousand inhabitants. By the same Table it is also shown that one person amongst every 41 living, died in London during the year; one amongst 42 living, died in the South District ; and one amongst every 44 living, died in the whole of Lambeth. In the Waterloo Road 1st part district, one amongst 42 living died during the year ; in the Waterloo Road 2nd part district, one amongst 39 living; in the Lambeth Church 1st part district, one amongst 41 living; in the Lambeth Church 2nd part district (including the Workhouse) one amongst 31 living; in the Kennington 18 at part district, one amongst 46 living; in the Kennington 2nd part district, one amongst 51 living ; in the Brixton district, one amongst 58 living ; and in the Norwood district, one amongst 51 living. The deaths from Epidemic diseases during 1870 are shown in Table IV., they amouned to 1121, and were 24¼ per cent, of the entire mortality; in the previous year they were 21 per cent. of the whole mortality. The increase in the deaths from Epidemic diseases was mainly due to Scarlet Fever. Scarlet Fever caused 479 deaths, Diarrhoea 247, Whooping Cough 164, Measles 94, Fever (including Typhus and Typhoid) 90, Small Pox 28, and Diphtheria 19 deaths. The deaths from Scarlet Fever were much more numerous than in 1869, and those from Diarrhoea, and Small Pox, rather increased; whilst the deaths from Whooping Cough, Measles, Fever (including Typhus and Typhoid), and Diphtheria all diminished. At Table V. is seen the number of cases of Illness from Epidemic Diseases attended by the Poor Law Medical Officers during each quarter of the year. The number of cases were 1173, of which 143 arose in the first quarter of the year, 195 in the second quarter, 470 in the third quarter, and 365 in the fourth quarter. There were 424 cases of Scarlet Fever, 393 cases of Diarrhoea, 154 cases of Measles, 100 cases Small Pox, 67 cases of Fever (including Typhus and Typhoid) and 35 cases of Whooping Cough. Of these the greatest number of cases of Scarlet Fever occurred in the third and fourth quarters of the year, the greatest number of Diarrhoea in the third, and the greatest number of Measles and Small Pox in the fourth quarter. The total number of cases of Epidemic Sickness amongst the Poor, were more numerous than in 1869 but less than in 1868. 14 In Table I. the number and nature of Nuisances removed, and Sanitary Work effected is set forth. The number of Nuisances removed amounted to 280G, irrespective of the Sanitary Work effected by systematic house inspection. There were 770 houses disinfected and cleansed, in winch Small Pox, and Fever occurred; 262 dirty houses cleansed; 155 houses without proper drainage, drained; 33 cesspools emptied or abolished; 357 obstructed drains remedied; 150 defective drains trapped; 224 houses provided with proper water supply; 49 closets provided or improved; 30 houses provided with means of ventilation; 21 houses with smells from dampness remedied; 16 yards of houses paved or improved; 218 dust bins erected; 535 accumulations of dung, &c., removed;17 cases of decomposed animal or vegetable matter removed; 16 foul urinals cleansed or improved; 87 dangerous structures removed; 8 smoke nuisances removed; 3 Trade Nuisances removed; 32 lots of swine, consisting of 167 Pigs removed; 15 lots of unwholesome Fish, consisting of 2447 fish of various descriptions, condemned and destroyed; 4 sieves of currants unfit for food, destroyed; 1 case of Infringement of the "Workshop Regulation Act," and 2 cases of illegal slaughtering of Sheep were fined; and 19 lots of infected bedding were burnt. In addition to the above, 1466 houses were systematically inspected, and the following improvements carried out in them; 230 dirty houses were cleansed and whitewashed; 144 delapidated houses were repaired; 106 houses were provided with means of ventilation; 101 houses were provided with new water supply, or the supply improved; 81 yards were paved or improved; 41 cases of defective drainage remedied; and 5 cases of bad smells from dampness removed. 15 Before the completion of the Works, 1974 Notices were required to be served, and 38 Summonses and Orders were issued. There were also 104 Licensed Slauterhouses, 95 Licensed Cowhouses, and 219 Bakehouses inspected, all of which were cleansed and whitewashed, and other improvements effected.
