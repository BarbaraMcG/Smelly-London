ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR 19 6 2 To: The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Chingford Corporation, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, I have pleasure in submitting my Annual Report for the year 1962 upon the health and sanitary circumstances of the The estimated population for the year was 46,350. Vital Statistics: In the statistics which follow, the figures in brackets refer to 1961. The birth-rate was 13.1 (l3.3) per 1,000, representing 609 (612) births. The number of deaths was 453 (407). The deathrate was 9.7 (8.8) per 1,000. To enable comparisons in the birth and death rates to be made with other areas and with England and Wales as a whole, it is necessary to make use of comparability factors, These factors are supplied by the General Register Office and they allow for differing sex and age distribution of local populations. The factors for Chingford are: Births 1.04 and Deaths 1.28. The table on page 4 indicates the crude rates and the rates adjusted by the comparability factors. The infant mortality rate was 11.4 (16.3), the rate for England and Wales being 21.4 (21.4), The table on page 4 shows at a glance the birth, death and infant mortality rates for the years 1957-62. Causes of Death: Diseases of the heart and circulation, and cancer, were the principal causes of death the numbers being 224 and 107 respectively. It will be seen that these two conditions are responsible for three deaths out of every four, The rise in recent years. in the deaths from diseases of the heart and circulation is indicated in the table on page Clearly much research remains to be done in the epidemiology of these conditions. 2. Infectious Diseases: There was very little infectious illness, the most significant being measles and. scarlet fever. Chiropody Service; There is now only one chiropodist giving treatment under the Old People's Welfare Scheme. However, it was possible to transfer most of the persons on the waiting list to the chiropody clinics of the Essex County Council, Air Pollution: The Council participated in the National Survey of Air Pollution undertaken by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Stevenage, Herts. Dr. F.G. Brown, Area Medical Officer, has kindly supplied the statistical matter on pages 5 and 6. Finally, I would express my thanks and appreciation to the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their support and to the staff of the Department for their co-operation during the year. J.

Immunisation against this disease is now combined with immunisation against whooping cough and tetanus. The number of children receiving this triple immunisation was 378; booster doses numbered 60. In addition, the following numbers of children received the immunisation indieated:- Diphtheria alone Primary 40 Booster 140 Diphtheria with Whooping Cough Primary 11 Booster 4 Diphtheria with Tetanus Primary 7 Booster 15 Scarlet Fever Forty-five cases were notified. This illness was of a very mild character and recovery was very rapid in each case. It was not necessary to admit any case to hospital. Measles This was the most prevalent of the infectious conditions. There were 125 notifications, only two of which needed hospital treatment. Measles serum was available to medical practitioners on application to the Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, for the treatment of cases and protection of contacts. Whooping Cough Whooping Cough cases proved to be exceedingly few in number, only 5 being reported. Immunisation against this disease is now combined with that against diphtheria and tetanus. The number of children receiving this triple immunisation was 378. In addition, the following numbers of children received the immunisation indicated:- Whooping Cough alone - Primary 24 Whooping Cough with - Primary 11 Diphtheria Dooster 4 11. Acute Poliomyelitis There was only one notification during 1962. This was in a child of 6 years and the condition was of the paralytic type. I am pleased to report that he has made an excellent recovery from his illness. The following statistics indicate the number of persons who received immunisation against polionyelitis during 1962:- No. receiving the two primary injections - 534 No. receiving the third injection - 1341 No. receiving fourth injection (special - 771 category, children between 5 & 12 years) No. receiving 3 doses oral (from 30.6.62) - 352 Tuberculosis Fresh cases of pulmonary tuberculosis numbering 14 were only one above the previous year. The general downward trend of new cases occurring annually since the end of the war is shown by the following table:- Year: 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 Cases: 46 42 34 36 44 30 39 30 20 Year: 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 Cases: 20 32 17 21 14 13 14 In the school health service B.C.G. vaccination was offered to all children in their fourteenth year and, as a result of this, 444 children were vaccinated. The Walthamstow and Chingford Association of Tuberculosis Care Helpers gave assistance wherever possible to patients and their families who suffered financial loss through the need for prolonged treatment at home or in hospital. This assistance was mostly in the form of groceries, fuel, clothing and holidays. The contribution of £30 which the Chingford Borough Council makes annually to this Association is very much appreciated. Dysentery Fifteen cases of dysentery were notified during the year. Food Poisonin.; The two cases reported were found to be due to salmonella infection. 12. Food Hygiene All food premises in the borough received close attention from the Health Inspectors. Vaccination Primary vaccinations against smallpox totalled 3,775 (520 in 196l) and re-vaccinations 4,813 (162 in 196l). This vast increase in the number of persons vaccinated and revaccinated resulted from the importation of smallpox cases from abroad during December 1961 and January 1962. National Assistance Act, 1948 (a) Section 47: Care of Aged and Chronic Sick. No cases needed statutory action under Section 47. In several instances the provision of a home help obviated the need for hospital care or admission to an old persons' home. (b) Section 50: No burials were arranged by the Council under this section. Medical Examinations During the year 142 examinations were carried out by me in respect of Chingford Council staff and 38 in respect of staff of the Essex County Council.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Water Supplies Under the provision of Section 138 of the Public Health Act 1936 (as amended by the Water Act 1945) it is the duty of the Local Authority to ensure that every dwelling in the district is provided with a suitable and sufficient water supply. In this district the water is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board whose Dr, Windle-Taylor, Director of Water Examination, has submitted the following information:- "I can state that the water supplied to the Borough of Chingford has been satisfactory in quality and quantity during 1962, The main source of supply is River Lea derived water from the Board's Lee Bridge works but in addition there is admixture of water from the Board's wells at Chingford and Perry Lane, The water is not plumbo solvent, I regret that I have no record of the number of dwelling houses supplied but all supplies are direct to the houses and none are permanently supplied by standpipes, (There are 14,335 dwelling houses in the Borough and all are supplied with water direct to the house by the Metropolitan Water Board, C.P.H.I.) No new sources of supply were instituted by the Board in your Borough during 1962 nor were there any extensions of important trunk mains. There were no changes in the general scheme of supply during the year but new service mains were laid to the extent of 546 yards. All new and repaired mains are disinfected with chlorine before being passed for service and the water in them is tested to ensure that it is up to the quality normally supplied." Fluoride. The average natural content of fluoride in the water supplied in the Borough is 0.3 milligrams per litre. The accepted amount necessary for protection against dental caries is 1.0 milligrams per litre. 19. Public Swimming, Bath. The Larkswood open air swimming pool is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board. The water is subjected to continuous chlorination and filtration and has a six hour complete turnover at the rate of 130,000 gallons per hour. The Borough Engineer and Surveyor forwards weekly summaries of the total chlorine and alkalinity to the Health Department, Check samples taken by the Health Department have been satisfactory. Sewerage and Sewage Disposal. The Public Health Act 1936 (Part II); the Essex County Council Act 1952 and the Public Health Act 1961 contain the main provisions relating to sewerage, sewage disposal and drainage. Generally, the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department is responsible for the construction and maintenance of sewers vested in the Council and the Public Health Department for sewers which are repairable at the property owners' expense. The cost of cleaning and clearing blockages in these latter sewers is borne by the Council and the cost of repairs borne by the various owners whose properties they serve. The Borough Engineer and Surveyor has submitted the following report on this aspect of the work in his Department. "Sewerage During the past year the sewerage system has been adequate for the needs of the Borough and no flooding took place although the risk in one isolated instance will continue until the new sewer to Deephams is constructed. Sewage Disposal Works. Intimation has been received that the new gravity sewer to convey the whole of the sewage from Chingford to the Edmonton Works of the Middlesex County Council will be commenced on the 12th May 1963 and upon completion of this sewer the works at Chingford will become redundant probably towards the end of 1964. In the meantime because of continued over-loading and adverse weather conditions there are occasions when the effluent is a little below standard. Unfortunately this is inevitable, but everything possible is being done to maintain the works at maximum practicable efficienoy until they are no longer required," 20. Public Cleansing. (a) Refuse Collection. A regular weekly collection was maintained and 11,391 tons of town refuse and salvage were collected from 14,927 premises. Domestic refuse is continually becoming less dense and increasing in bulk. It is also anticipated that the amount of refuse will increase with the introduction of smoke control areas. To combat this extra bulk, the Council has now decided upon a policy of gradually replacing its fleet of side loaders with a larger capacity compression type collection vehicles, (b) Refuse disposal. The Council has set aside its plan for disposal of refuse by controlled tipping because of the imminent amalgamation of the Boroughs of Chingford, Walthamstow and Leyton, Refuse was to have been taken to a new loading bay, there transferred to large capacity vehicles and transported to a tip outside the district. The incineration of refuse has thus had to be continued. The incineration plant was not designed for the present volume of refuse and was being heavily overloaded, resulting in numerous complaints of nuisance. The Council therefore decided to reduce burning by tipping 25% of the refuse, A large capacity compression type collection vehicle was purchased and takes approximately 10 tons of refuse per day direct from households to a tip at Fishers Green, Waltham Holy Cross, In order to further diminish nuisance from the incinerator the installation of a water spray was also authorised, By this means gases from the incinerator chambers will be washed and chimney emissions reduced. These necessary measures together with a loss of income from a fall in the value of salvage have increased the cost of the service over and above the rise resulting from wage awards, (c) Refuse collection and disposal costs. The net expenditure for the collection and disposal of refuse and salvage, including loan charge, for the financial year 1962/3 was £33,482 or 38/9d per ton compared with £27,010 or 48/5d per ton for the previous year. (a) Street cleansing. 21. Pour electric trucks have been provided,with an establishment of 16 street orderlies plus four reliefs to cover holidays and sickness and to provide replacements for the refuse collection service. Difficulties in recruitment of suitable and sufficient labour have continued and seldom was the full complement available, particularly during the summer holiday season. Meclianical sweeping is being considered as a means of overcoming this problem, (e) Gully cleansing. Road gullies were cleansed by contract as in previous years. Owing to severe weather conditions one quarterly treatment was cancelled so that half the district road gullies were cleansed twice and the remainder once. Main road gullies were cleansed three times, (f) Public conveniences. The Council have provided and maintain four public conveniences. One is provided with full-time attendants and three with part-time attendants. During the very cold weather in December considerable difficulty was experienced in keeping the conveniences open for the public because of frozen services. On occasions they had to be closed. The Council is considering ways and means of preventing a recurrence. The lack of wash hand basins, hot water, soap and towels at the unattended conveniences is a matter of concern; the wilful damage of the fittings and fixtures which occurs when the conveniences are unattended discourages the provision of these amenities. In accordance with the national trend, the charge for the use of water closets was discontinued. There has been no noticeable increase in wilful damage or insanitary usage since. 22.

SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA. During the twelve month period under review 860 complaints were received (see summary Appendix A, page 45 ). 11,306 visits and inspections were made (see summary, Appendix B. page 46 ) and it is estimate that 1,700 persons were interviewed at the office, A considerable amount of repair work and many improvements were carried out following informal requests but formal action had to be taken under various enactments as follows:- Public Health Act 1936.

Section 7 (Provision and maintenance of sanitary conveniences). There were 88 factories, all using power, on the District register at the end of the year. It was not found necessary to take any statutory action under this Act, defects being remedied informally.

Under the provisions of Section 3 of the Housing Act 1957 it is the duty of the local authority to ensure that their district is inspected with a view to ascertaining whether any house is unfit for habitation. Section 4 of the Housing Act defines the standard of fitness; "In determining for any of the purposes of this Act whether a house is unfit for human habitation, regard shall be had to its condition in respect of the following matters, that is to say - repair;stability; freedom from damp; natural lighting; ventilation; water supply; drainage and sanitary conveniences; facilities for storage, preparation and cooking of food and for the disposal of waste water; and the house shall be deemed to be unfit for human habitation if and only if it is so far defective in one or more of the said matters that it is not reasonably suitable for occupation in that condition." During the year 205 dwelling houses were inspected and 114 were found to be in some respects unfit. These were dealt with as set out below:- Housing Act 1957 - Section 16. Unfit premises beyond repair at reasonable expense. It was found necessary to report 5 houses to the Council as being unfit and beyond repair at reasonable expense. Demolition orders were subsequently made by the Council. Public Health Act 1936. Section 92. Premises in such a state as to be -prejudicial to health and a nuisance. In 87 cases the defects were remedied following the service of informal notices and in 22 cases it was found necessary to serve Statutory notices. in respect of housing defects. 34. House Purchase and Housing Act 1959. Under the provisions of this Act grants are available to property owners for the improvement of sub-standard houses. The following grants were made in 1962. Standard grants 5 Discretionary grants 5 These grant schemes were designed to encourage the improvement of structurally sound houses by bringing them up to a modern standard of amenity by the installation of a hot water supply, wash basin, bath. indoor water closet, proper food storage accommodation and in the case of discretionary grants, other improvements. Thus, these houses would be given a new lease of life at a modest outlay compared to the much larger expense of demolishing and rebuilding, for such substandard properties will undoubtedly become less attractive and in time, the slums of the future. It must be in the national interest to arrest this deterioration and so take proper care of this enormous asset-our homes and surely, in this age of space flights and tha atom, it should be possible to provide every family with a bath, a hot water supply and an indoor water closet. Unfortunately the scheme is failing because few owner/occupiers and no owners of tenanted houses are improving their properties. This experience is common to built up areas throughout the country. It is chiefly for this reason that the Minister has issued the following circular: Ministry of Housing and Local Government Circular 42/62. Local authorities are urged to encourage the improvement of houses lacking bathrooms, washbasins, hot water supplies and indoor water closets. It suggests that suitable groups of houses which are sufficiently well built and have the capacity to merit improvement should be selected and dealt with as Improvement Areas, In these Areas local authorities are recommended to survey all houses and make every effort to persuade owners to carry out necessary improvements. In cases where co-operation is not received the Minister states that he will be prepared to consider compulsory action. Upon the instructions of the Council, a survey of properties in selected areas was commenced during the latter part of 1962 to determine the number and location of houses in the Borough worthy of improvement with a view to making 'Improvement Areas. 35. Housing Act 1961. Section 15. Under the provisions of this section it was found necessary to serve a notice in respect of inadequate personal washing facilities and food storage accommodation in a house in multiple occupation. The Housing (Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation) Regulations 1962. The above regulations which came into force on the 22nd May 1962 are designed to ensure that the person managing the house keeps the premises in good order and repair and makes proper provision in respect of water supply, drainage, use of bathroor, kitchens, water closets, common staircases and passages etc. Rent Act 1957. Since the above Act came into force on 6th July 1957 the Department has dealt with thirty-five applications for certificates of disrepair. During 1962 only two applications were received and one certificate of disrepair was issued. 36. CLEAN AIR ACT 1956. Smoke Control Areas - Phased Programme.

An area on the western boundary of the Borough and hounded by the south side of Kings Head Hill, north side of The Ridgeway, the west side of Old Church Road and as far as Prioiy Avenue (North side). 37. Chingford Smoke Control Order (No.8) 1972. 460 acres; 1430 dwelling houses. An area which consists of part of the northern section of the district with boundaries on the north side of Kings Road Hill and the north side of Station Road, Chingford Smoke Control Order (No,9) 1974. 344 acres; 1162 dwelling houses. An area with boundaries on the south side of Station Road and the north side of Kings Road and Whitehall Road, The street/year index showing the year in which each street will be the subject of a Smoke Control Order is printed at the end of my report (Appendix D). Details of the two Smoke Control Orders in operation during 1962 are set out delow: a) Chingford Smoke Control Order (No,l) 1960, - This order came into operation on the 3rd November 1960 and covers some 38 acres in the northern part of the Borough, The Order affects 386 houses, of which 323 are Council houses, A total of 415 adaptations or replacements of existing fireplaces were carried out at a total approved cost of £941.18,1d, The total cost to the Chingford Council was £582,3,6d, (b) Chingford Smoke Control Order (No,2) 1962. -This order came into operation on the 1st November 1962 and covers some 227 acres in the southern part of the Borough, The Order affects 1,822 private dwelling houses, 157 Borough Council dwelling houses and 115 factories, offices and shops, A detailed survey revealed that 2858 adaptations or replacements of fireplaces were necessary. The total cost of the work carried out at the 30th December 1962 was £5,628,9.4d of which the Borough Council's contribution (3/10ths and in respect of their own properties 6/l0ths) was £1,805,13.1d. Seotion 12 (Adaptations of fireplaces in private houses.) During the year the following notices were served upon owners of private dwelling houses requiring adaptations or replacements of fireplaces. a) Intimation notices - 2,622. b) Statutory notices - 540. The number of Statutory notices outstanding on the 30th December 1962 was 345. Measurement of smoke and sulphur dioxide. Daily measurements are taken at the Town Hall by the volumetric method. The table in Appendix C shows the monthly average and highest daily readings while the graphs show comparisons with other selected areas. 38. FOOD CONTROL FOOD INSPECTION. Food and Drugs Act 1955. Section 2 (General protection for purchasers of food and drugs,) In five cases legal proceedings were instituted following complaints of food which was not of the nature, substance or quality demanded "by the purchaser. Nature of offence.

It could be that these goods are sometimes delivered to shops in that state but, due to the absence of means of identifying the date of delivery, this can rarely be proved. Retailers could, as a very few do, protect themselves by dating their perishable goods on delivery either openly or in a simple code. By this means, shop management would find it much easier to check for freshnesa and thus protect their business AND their customers. Unfortunately most retailers resist dating goods and rely on memory and appearance to sort out the old from the new, a most unreliable method in these days of prepackaging and refrigerated display. Without the co-operation of the trade we must expect to buy and consume stale foodstuffs from time to time. 39. Section 9 (Examination and seizure of unsound food.)

I am concerned at the lack of control over these foodstuffs after condemnation. Because there is no suitable departmental transport, condemned food has to be left in the shops until it can be picked up on a refuse collection round. It is undesirable to leave bad food in the shops longer than is necessary and in the present circumstances, it is difficult to check that all the food has been collected. 40.

Legal Proceedings under the Regulations. It was found necessary to institute legal proceedings for the following contraventions in a butcher's shop:- FINE. Regulation (8) Placing meat so as to involve risk of contamination £15 " (6) Failing to keep equipment clean £15 " (16) Failing to provide wash hand basins £15 " (23) Failing to keep walls, floors etc, clean £15 " (14) Failing to keep sanitary conveniences clean £15 " (l4) Failing to keep W.C. suitably lighted £15 Food at fairs The standard of food hygiene at some of the food stalls operating at the Chingford Fairs has been unsatisfactory and so I have taken steps to ensure that all food vendors' stalls are inspected and the conditions improved before they are allowed on the site. This necessarily involves the co-operation of the Public Health Inspectors in whose districts the food hawkers are normally resident. The hawkers are to be required to be registered with this authority for the sale of food in Chingford. I am grateful to the Forest Superintendent and his staff for their assistance in dealing with this problem.

The manufacturers were requested to relabel their product.) Brandy 1 Genuine Gin 1 " Rum 2 " Whisky 2 " The Chief Public Health Inspectors of the Essex local authorities circulate between themselves a monthly list of samples taken and results obtained. Thus control is effected over a wide range of foodstuffs and drugs with economy in time and expense. As a further control I hope to commence bacteriological sampling of foodstuffs; in particular cooked meats which, because of their nature and current methods of handling, are extremely vulnorable to bacterial contamination. To be effective this work has to be carried out very carefully and with considerable preparation, all of which takes much time. The difficulty at present is that pressure of routine work keeps my inspectors fully occupied and leaves little time for this type of special investigation. 44. The Meat (Staining and Sterilization) Regulations 1960. These regulations require all butcher's meat and imported meat which is unfit for human consumption to be sterilized or. stained before entering the chain of distribution. During the year, 29 samples of unsterilized and unstained imported horse flesh were obtained from pet shops and submitted to the Bacteriologist for examination. As a result of adverse reports, 3 dealers ceased to sell imported horse flesh for food for pots. The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations 1960. Licences, which are granted for a five year period commencing 1st January 1961, continued to apply in respect of the following:- Dealers' licences to sell milk as tuberculin tested 6 Dealers' licences to sell milk as pasteurised 9 Dealers' licences to sell milk as sterilised 15 Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations 1959 (Milk distributors). No, of registered dairy premises in the Borough 3 No, of premises in the Borough other than dairies from which milk is sold 10 Bacteriological sampling of milk. Four samples of milk to which the special designations applied were obtained and submitted to the Public Health Laboratories for examination. In all cases the samples proved to be satisfactory when tested in accordance with the Regulations. Merchandise Marks Acts and Orders. The Acts require that goods for sale shall be correctly described. The Orders require that various imported foods e.g. meat, apples, tomatoes, are labelled on display with an indication of their origin, i.e. foreign, empire or the name of the country of origin. Several warnings were given for contraventions. 45. APPENDIX A. Summary of complaints received during 1962, The number of complaints received by the department was 953.
