Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in presenting to you my Annual Report for 1960. The Report follows the usual form, being mainly statistical, but with comments on any points of special interest. The decline in population, to which reference has been made in previous years, continued in 1960 from 108,500 to 107,120, a reduction of 1,380. The total number of live and still births was 1,968, while the live birth rate based on the number of live births, namely 1,933, was 17.50, a slight reduction over the previous year. The total number of deaths of people living in Battersea was 1,138, which gave a death rate per 1,000 of the population of 10.09, a reduction from the rate of 11.63 noted in 1959. In 1960, the number of infant deaths at 35 was nine fewer than in the previous year, and this gave an infant mortality rate of 18.1. This is not the lowest rate ever recorded in Battersea, for in 1952 the rate was 17.6, but it is nevertheless a gratifying reduction. Equally gratifying was the fact that no death occurred from diseases or accidents of child birth in 1960, and here we have to go back to 1951 to find a similar record. These low rates are most satisfactory. I have, however, noted in previous years that when the rates are reduced to low levels. and are based on a comparatively small number of actual cases, chance variations from year to year are bound to occur. It is, therefore, too much to hope that in each subsequent year we shall be able to report no maternal deaths, and an infant death rate as low as 18.1. Nevertheless, these low rates do reflect a great credit on everyone concerned with maternal and child health, particularly midwives, both domicilary and those in hospital, health visitors, general practitioners and obstetricians. The corresponding figures for the infant mortality rate and maternal rate in the administrative County of London are 21.48 and 0.45. The year was not very eventful from the point of view of infectious diseases. The total figure of infectious diseases notified, namely 558. was the lowest ever reported in Battersea, due in the main to the comparatively low incidence of cases of measles and dysentery. Measles. as is well-known, tends to occur in London every two years, and as 1960 was a "non-measles year", the drop in cases occasioned no surprise. The drop in the number of cases of dysentery, however, to 68 in 1960, from 167 in 1959, was satisfactory, since dysentery, although in most cases not a serious illness, can be of considerable nuisance value. It is hoped that this reduction will continue in subsequent years. as investigation in these cases entails a considerable amount of work. often showing relatively little result. Only one case of poliomyelitis arose during 1960. Some reference is made in the body of the Report to the action taken when the personal linen from a case of smallpox, which occurred in another part of London, was sent to a large laundry in Battersea. An incident such as this, although only a part of the steps taken to prevent the spread of smallpox, gives rise to a surpising number of problems, and an equally surprising amount of work for the Health Department. 5 The decline in the number of cases of tuberculosis brought to our notice continued during 1960. Although the number of cases notified in Battersea increased slightly from 75 in 1959 to 79 in 1960, only 44 cases as against 63 were reported to us from other sources, making a total of cases of which we became aware in 1960 of 123, as compared with ,138 in 1959. There were only 6 deaths due to pulmonary tuberculosis in Battersea in 960, and none were caused by non-pulmonary form of the disease. This figure gave a death rate per 100,000 of the population of 5.6, the lowest rate ever recorded. The table on page 18 showing the death rates from tuberculosis brings out very well the marked reduction in the death rate which has occurred over the years. I have commented in previous Reports on the changing emphasis which is taking place towards diseases of the chest, and the greater attention being paid to bronchitis and cancer of the lung and I need not dwell on the subject in detail. The general supervision of environmental conditions in Battersea carried out by the Public Health Inspectors continued during the year, and the statistical records are to be found in the body of the Report. General work under the Public Health (London) Act and the Food and Drug Act proceeded much on the lines of previous years, but I should like to make a little more reference to the slum clearance programme under the housing Act. During the year, a large area of the Winstanley Road Are was represented for clearance, following the inspection of that are to which I made reference in last year's Report. At the end of the year, the date of the public inquiry into the Council's Order was awaited. If and when this area is confirmed, a further substantial section of the Winstanley Road scheme will be in train for clearance and development. Also during the year, areas in Weybridge Street and Blondel Street were represented, and here again the date of the public Inquiry was awaited at the end of the year. Here, likewise, if and when this area is confirmed, a further sizeable part of the Battersea Park rehousing area will be available for extensions to the redevelopment of the area. All in alsaid that 1960 saw considerable progress in the Council's slum clearance programme. The figures showing the general trend of home accidents in Battersea are continued in the tables on pages 49, 50. These figures are not absolutely accurate, but are computed from returns supplied by the London Ambulance Service. They do, however, provide a general, but only a general, indication of the trend of accidents in the home. In so far as they do illustrate a trend, they do not provide much scope for satisfaction, for they suggest an increase in 1960 over previous years, and the main increase is to be seen in accidents due to falls. The distribution of accidents among the different age groups has not changed very much. Allowing for the fact that these figures illustrate a trend only therer was certainly no improvement in 1960 over the previous years. It is difficult to know how to get across to the public the danger of accidents taking place in the home. In the main, reliance must rest on the Personal approach by members of our staff who come into contact with those of the population who are most likely to meet with accidents, particularly the elderly and the old. Thus, we must depend on health visitors, home helps and social workers, and also Public Health Inspectors, who have access to people's houses. Unfortunately, it is in the groups most at risk where it is often-times most difficult to 6 effect possibly even quite small changes of routine which might lessen the chances of an accident. Modern society has long recognised that the care and welfare of old people is an important responsibility of the community which is likely to become even more so in the years ahead. It is very satisfactory to be able to refer (on page 47) to the steps which were taken during the year to strengthen the services in Battersea. There also will be found mention of the valuable help we receive from the Staff of St. John's Hospital, where there is a unit devoted to the care of old people, where work of the highest class is carried on. I am sure that the strengthening of the community services, together with the expert advice and help available at St. John's, will result in a steadily improving service for the care and welfare of old people in Battersea. The work of the section of the Health Department devoted to the implementation of the Clean Air Act continued in 1960. The final work on the Council's No. 1 Smoke Control Area was completed, and preliminary work on the second Area proceeded. The Order relative to the latter Area was duly made, and at the end of the year confirmation was awaited. Dr. Lowry, the Deputy Medical Office of Health, tendered his resignation during the year on being appointed to a post abroad, and he left the Department in the middle of November. He took leave of the Department, where he had done some excellent work, particularly in relation to housing and old people, with the good wishes of everyone The Committee duly appointed in his place Dr. T. A. Plumley who, however, had not taken up his post when the year ended. It gives me again much pleasure to thank all those who have helped me and the Department during the year. Councillor Miss E.A. Coles, J.P., Chairman of the Health Committee, gave us her usual unstinted help and support, as indeed did all the Members of the Health Committee. I should also like to thank all the staff of the Health Department, and also the Chief Officers and their staff of other Departments, for their help and co-operation during the year. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. TUDOR LEWIS, Medical Officer of Health. 7 Public Health in Retrospect 1860-1960 In previous Annual Reports I have referred to reports made by my Predecessors one hundred years ago, and the following information has been extracted from a Report by Dr. William Connor, Medical officer of Health for the Battersea Parish in 1860. The population of Battersea in 1860 is estimated to have been about 19,500 (Population 1960—107,120), showing an increase of approximately 9,000 during the preceding ten years. Dr. Connor states— "This fact at once shows not only the growing importance of the parish, but the necessity which exists for persevering exertions, in order to ma,intain so large a population under proper and efficient sanitary regulations." "During 1860 there were registered in this parish 399 deaths from diseases and other causes, of which number 205 were of males, and 194 of female being five only in excess of the previous year, notwithstanding the increase of the population in the interval. The rate of mortality to population in 1860, I calculate, will have been somewhat under 21 in 1,000." (Deaths 1960—1,138 (561 males, 577 females), rate 10.09 per 1,000 Population.) During 1860, 112 infants under one year of age died, and, with the number of births being 680, this gave an infant mortality rate of 164.7 Per 1,000 live births. (Infant deaths 1960—35, rate 18.11). Houses and premises inspected during 1860 numbered 500 ; 32 cesspools were emptied and cleansed ; 1 cesspool was abolished ; 131 waterclosets were constructed; 130 houses supplied with water ; 140 dustbins provided; 5 pig nuisances removed. These figures, reports Dr. Connor— "- will show at a glance the character of the efforts that have been made during the past year to improve the sanitary aspects of the subdistrict and when the whole of these works are taken into consideration, it can scarcely be disputed that very many salutary influences have been brought into operation, the good results of which, especially amongst the Poor, are daily becoming more and more manifest." "This being my opinion, I cordially join with my colleagues in recommending a continuation of efforts to the end of bringing the workand classes to a still more profitable recognition of the laws of health, and consequently to a stricter obedience of those laws, as well in the performance of their social duties as of their physical labours." 8 Principal Figures for 1960.

For the purpose of standardisation, the Registrar-General's area comparability factors, which make allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that of England Wales as a whole, have been applied to the rates for births and deaths. The factor for births is 0.97, and for deaths 0.95. POPULATION. The Registrar-General's estimate of the mid-year home population of Battersea was 107,120 as compared with 108,500 in 1959, a decrease of 1,380. The estimated population at the Census taken in April, 1951, was 117,140; the 1960 figure of 107,120, when compared with this, shows a decrease of 10,020 (or 8.6 per cent.). The estimated mid-year home population figure of 107,120 has been adopted for the purpose of the statistics contained in this Report. BIRTHS. The number of live births registered in the Borough during 1960 was 466 (248 males, 218 females). Of this number 10 were transferred out, the Permanent residence of the parents being outside the Borough and 1,477 registered outside the Borough were transferred in, giving on balance a total of 1,933 births (1,057 males, 876 females, an excess of 181 males) relating to Battersea residents, and a live birth rate of 17.50 Per 1,000 population. All the Battersea births (456 live and 4 still) which occurred within the Borough were "domiciliary births." Illegitimate live births numbered 192 or 9.9 per cent. of the live births. The live birth rate for England and Wales was 17.1. Still-Births. The Registration of still-births is made compulsory by the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1926. During 1960 there were 5 still-births registered in Battersea, of which 4 were of Battersea parents. Thirty-one still-births occurring outside the Borough were registered as belonging to Battersea, making 35 in all, representing a still-birth rate of 17.78 per 1,000 births (live and still) registered. Of the 35 still-births 6 (17.14 per cent.) were registered as illegitimate. The number of Battersea still-births registered and the still-birth rate from 1951 to 1960 were as under: — No. Rate No. Rate 1951 37 19.2 1956 48 26.42 1952 42 23.2 1957 51 27.01 1953 38 20.9 1958 39 20.34 1954 50 28.0 1959 36 17.42 1955 32 18.1 1960 35 17.78 The still-birth rate in 1960 for England and Wales was 19.7. 10 MARRIAGES. The marriages registered in Battersea during 1960 numbered 961. The marriage rate (i.e., the number of persons married per 1,000 of the population) was 17.9.

The number of deaths registered in the Borough during 1960 2,043. Of these, 1,244 were deaths of non-residents and were transferred to the districts in which the persons ordinarily resided. There were, on the other hand, 339 deaths of Battersea residents registered outside the Borough. The total (corrected) number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 1,138 (561 males and 577 females). This gives a recorded death rate of 10.09 compared with 11.5 for England and Wales.

During 1960 the number of deaths of Battersea residents from cancer was 262 (135 males, 127 females), as compared with 246 in 1959. The death rate from the disease per 1,000 of the population was 2.45. The deaths from cancer constitute 23.2 per cent. of the total Battersea deaths during the year. The following gives the comparative average death rates from cancer in Battersea for quinquennial periods since 1901. 1901-1905 0.88 1936-1940 1.99 1906-1910 0.95 1941-1945 2.44 1911-1915 1.11 1946-1950 2.11 1916-1920 1.28 1951-1955 2.07 1921-1925 1.33 1956-1960 2.29 1926-1930 1.51 1960 2.45 1931-1935 1.75 Details in age groups and the localisation of this disease will be sound on page 11. Infant Mortality. During 1960 the deaths of 35 infants under 1 year of age were registered as belonging to Battersea. The total number of live births registered during the year was 1,933 giving an infant mortality rate of 18.11 per 1,000 live births as compared with 21.67 in 1959 and 23.96 in 1958. The infant mortality rate in England and Wales during 1960 was 21.7. 14 The following table sets out the causes of death in detail. Infant Mortality, 1960.

The death rate amongst illegitimate children during 1960 was 52.08 per 1,000 illegitimate live births, as compared with 43.96 in 1959. The corresponding death rate of legitimate children in 1960 was 14.36, the ratio of mortality rate of illegitimate infants to that of legitimate being 360 to 100. The corresponding figure for 1959 was 225 to 100. Maternal Mortality. There were no deaths from "diseases or accidents of child-birth" during 1960. During 1959 there were two such deaths. The rate for England and Wales in 1960 was 0.39. Coparative Statistics of Births, Motality, etc. (Compiled from Registrar-General's Returns.)

During the year, 558 notifications were received, which, when compared with 1,187 cases in 1959, shows a decrease of 629. This figure is the lowest ever recorded in Battersea. The decrease was mainly due to the comparatively small number of measles and dysentery cases notified, 186 and 68 in 1960, compared with 702 and 167 respectively in 1959. This shows a decrease of 516 measles and 99 dysentery cases. Two cases of typhoid occurred within the Borough during the year. In the first case, it is thought that the patient, a 39-year-old labourer, contracted the disease whilst he was working in a sewer outside the Borough. This case proved fatal. The second case occurred in an 11-years-old boy, and it would appear that he contracted the disease whilst on holiday in Italy. He was admitted to hospital for treatment and all specimens taken from him since have been negative. There were also five cases of para-typhoid notified during 1960, and a further case was revealed by investigation. These cases lived within a very small area of the Borough, three cases occurring in one family, but even after extensive enquiries the source of infection was not discovered. It is of interest to note that the strain of salmonella para-typhi 'B' isolated from five of the cases was of a completely new type, and has now been named "Battersea" by the Colindale Enteric Reference Laboratory. In one case, that of a 61-year-old woman, it proved fatal. A total of 59 specimens was taken in connection with this disease. Only one case of Poliomyelitis occurred in 1960, and this was & a girl aged 4. She had been vaccinated against the disease. Paralysis affected the right arm only. No cases of diphtheria occurred within the Borough during 1960. No cases of smallpox occurred during the year, but a confirmed case residing outside the Borough sent his soiled linen to a Battersea laundry on the same day as the diagnosis was made. Vaccination was immediately offered to all the laundry employees, and 112 of them took advantage of this protection, and a further 5 were vaccinated by own doctors. Only one person refused vaccination altogether. A daily visit was made to the laundry and any absentees were visited in their homes. There were also five direct contacts living in Battersea, and here again vaccination was offered to them, which they accepted. All the contacts were visited daily, and it was found necessary to exclude three of them from work. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1959, Section 26. This section is concerned with the prevention of the spread notifiable infectious diseases, and the diseases to which section 23 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, applies. It authorises a Metropolitan Borough Council, if they think fit, to compensate a person who is required by the Medical Officer of Health to cease his or her employment to prevent the spread of the disese. The Health Committee decided that compensation to be paid should be based on the merits of each case reported. Two cases were dealt with during the year. 17 Analysis of (after Correction of Diagnosis) of Infectious Disease Notified during the Year 1960.

During the year 1960 there were 79 cases of tuberculosis (all forms notified in Battersea as compared with 75 in 1959, 75 in 1958, 100 in 1957, 108 in 1956 and 129 in 1955. In addition 44 cases were reported or otherwise came to the knowledge the Medical Officer of Health, making a total of 123 cases for the year. The case rate per 1,000 population (excluding inward transfers) was 0.74 or 74.0 per 100,000. At the end of the year there were 1,086 pulmonary cases and 58 non-pulmonary cases of tuberculosis on the Register. This is equal to a morbidity rate per 1,000 population of 10.14 in the case of pulmonary, and 0.54 in the case of non-pulmonary tuberculosis or 10.68 both types. The tables on page 19 give details of additions and deletions of cases on the Register during the year. 18 Deaths from Tuberculosis. During 1960 deaths from tuberculosis registered as belonging to the Borough of Battersea numbered 6, all of which were due to pulmonary tuberculosis. The death rates per 100,000 of the population during the 55 years ended 1955 in quinquennial averages, and the years 1956 to 1960, are given in the following table:— Years Pulmonary NonPulmonary Total 1901-1905 138.1 50.9 189.0 1906-1910 126.8 45.9 172.7 1911-1915 124.2 33.8 158.0 1916-1920 134.8 30.0 164.8 1921-1925 92.6 23.0 115.6 1926-1930 91.1 14.2 105.3 1931-1935 81.8 14.4 96.2 1936-1940 76.1 9.2 85.3 1941-1945 91.8 11.0 102.8 1946-1950 53.1 6.1 59.2 1951-1955 22.1 2.8 24.9 Average (55 years) 93.9 21.9 115.8 1956 12.4 0.9 13.3 1957 8.9 0.9 9.8 1958 15.4 2.7 18.1 1959 6.5 0.9 7.4 1960 5.6 — 5.6 Average (5 years 1956-60) 9.7 1.1 10.8 The death rate per 100,000 population was 7.5 for Englal1 and Wales. 19 Tuberculosis, 1960.

Diphtheria and whooping cough immunisation and vaccination against smallpox and poliomyelitis were carried out during the year under the arrangements made by the London County Council. 21 BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS The bacteriological examination of clinical material (with the exception of sputum which is dealt with at the Chest Clinic) was carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service, County Hall, Westminster Bridge, S.E.I. No charge is made to the Council for these examinations. During the year 1,172 examinations were made as follows:— Description Disease Number of Specimens Positive Results Faeces Dysentery or Food Poisoning 1,062 254 Faeces Typhoid or Paratyphoid Fever 89 4 Throat Swabs Diphtheria 21 — INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATES OF VACCINATION and INOCULATION. At the request of the Ministry of Health arrangements are made for the authentication, by the Medical Officer of Health, of certificates of vaccination and inoculation issued by medical practitioners in the Borough in respect of persons going abroad. During 1960, 399 certificates were authenticated. 22 Sanitary Circumstances. The following table sets out in summarised form the details of the work of the Department in relation to sanitation:— Inspections— Complaints 3,105 Rent Act 153 Urinals and conveniences 290 Caravans 305 Water certificates 65 Infectious disease cases— Notifiable 452 Non-notifiable 119 Drainage 3,338 Shops (Shops Act) 205 Rag flock premises 12 Pet shops 20 Hairdressers 141 Rodent Control 2,992 Other visits 5,194 Re-inspections 10,376 Notices served— Intimation 1,278 Statutory (Infectious Disease) 28 Statutory (Nuisance) 675 L.C.C.

During the year, legal proceedings were taken by the Council in cases, for the enforcement of various Acts, By-laws, Regulations, administered by the Health Department. A summary is set out below:- Cases Public Health (London) Act, 1936 88 By-laws re drainage 6 Housing Act, 1957 2 96 Fines totalling £31 0s. 0d. were imposed in connection with these proceedings, and £44 10s. 0d. costs were awarded to the Council. Public Health (London) Act, 1936. The provisions of this Act in regard to Nuisances continued to afford the main means whereby the remedy of insanitary conditions found in dwelling houses could be secured. During the year, 1,278 Intimation Notices (relating to 994 premises) and 665 Statutory (Nuisance) Notices (relating to 616 premises) were served. It was found necessary to refer 173 cases to the Council's Solicitor with instructions to take steps, by legal proceedings if necessary, to enforce compliance with Statutory Notices. In 85 of these cases a warning letter from the Solicitor had the desired effect. In the remaining 88 cases, however, summonses had to be issued. As a result, Nuisance Orders were made by the Court in 32 instances. The remaining 56 summonses were ultimately withdrawn, the Notices having been complied with subsequent to the issue of the summonses. Defective conditions in 1,194 houses were remedied—556 by owners following the service of Intimation Notices; 620 by owners following the service of Statutory Notices, and in 18 cases action to enforce compliance with Nuisance Orders had to be taken, and the Council carried out the work default of the persons on whom the Orders were made. In those cases, the Council were entitled to recover the cost of the works from those persons, and accounts were accordingly rendered to them. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1955. Section 25 of the above Act relative to choked drains was used on 113 occasions. This Section enables a notice to be served upon an owner or occupier to clear a stopped-up drain, water closet or soil pipe, within forty-eight hours. If the notice is not complied with the Council may carry out the work and recover the cost. It was necessary for the council to do the work on 30 occasions. Section 26 enables the Council to re-instate a water supply to a dwelling after the supply has been withdrawn by the Metropolitan Water Board following a defect in the supply pipe or fittings. Notices were served on eight occasions and in four cases the Council did the work in default. 24 Authority has been given by the Council to the Medical Officer of Health, the Deputy Medical Officer of Health, and the Chief Public Health Inspector to serve Section 27 notices on behalf of the Council to remedy nuisances within a specific time where unreasonable delay would be occasioned by following the normal procedure. It was necessary to serve 15 such notices during the year, and the Council carried out the work in default of the owner on five occasions. Dustbins. During the year, 21 notices were served under Section 12 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954, concerning the provision of dustbins, and 66 dustbins were provided, 2 being supplied by the Council in default of the owners, from whom the cost was afterwards recovered. Drainage Work. Drainage work to new premises, reconstruction of drains to existing premises, and drainage in connection with conversion schemes, are carried out under the supervision of the officers of the Department. Drains were constructed to 136 new dwellings, and 222 plans proposed work were deposited in connection with drainage generallyDuring the year, 131 drains were tested with smoke—80 of these Were found to be defective. The water test was applied on 1,231 occasions to drains in the course of construction. 27 frontage drains (the length of drain between the house property to its connection with the sewer) were constructed or reconstructed. This work is carried out by the Council's workmen under the supervision of the Inspectors. Drainage and Watercloset By-laws made by the London County Council are enforced by the Council. In 14 instances it was necessary to request the Council's Solicitor to take legal action for non-compliance with the By-laws in connection with the failure by the persons concerned to either deposit plans or to notify the Council of the work to be carried out; or work carried out which did not comply with the requirements of the By-laws. In 11 instances the By-laws were complied with before summonses were heard, but the remaining 3 cases were dealt with the Magistrate. Fines totalling £6 0s. 0d. were imposed, and £3 0s. 0d. costs were awarded to the Council. Combined Drainage. Two claims that a combined drain was a sewer were received during the year. In one case, following investigation of a complaint of rat infestation, the drain common to two houses was found to be defective A claim by the owner of one of the houses showed the common Portion of the drain was a "sewer" repairable by the Council, and the work was accordingly carried out at the Council's expense. In a similar case, a drain serving four houses was claimed to be a sewer, and this was also repaired by the Council. Flooding. ^ Flooding occurred in the Borough during the year, the most serious occasion being in the month of August. The flooding followed torrential and persistent heavy rain, which overloaded the existing sewer system. All possible help was made available to the persons affected. 25 Because of flooding in the Battersea area the London County Council have sewer schemes in hand to improve the present main sewers. A sewer to relieve the Heathwall Sewer has been constructed, and a Second low level relief sewer is contemplated. New pumping stations are also to be constructed, and although the completion of this work will take several years, an improvement in the situation should be noticeable next year. Water Supply. The water supply in Battersea, in common with other London Boroughs, is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board, and they are responsible for its purity. There is one exception, however, and this applies to the supply of water to part of the Council's Latchmere Estate. These houses are supplied from deep wells situated at the Latchmere Baths, adjoining the Estate. Bacteriological examination of the water supply before chlorination, and prior to its supply to the Estate, is carried out at fortnightly intervals, with consistently satisfactory results. The chemical analysis of the water is satisfactory, and no significant change in character has been noted over a period of many years. In the event of a breakdown of the pumping apparatus serving the wells, or any other contingency, the system can be adjusted to receive water from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. All the premises in the Borough have a mains water supply. During the year 12 certificates under Section 95 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, were issued in respect of 136 new or re-erected dwellings. Thirty-one notices of waste of water from defective fittings, etc., observed during routine inspections of various premises, were sent to the Metropolitan Water Board. Caravans. All caravan sites in the Borough must now be licensed under the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1959. After the "Appointed Day" (1st October, 1960), an offence would be committed by person using, or knowingly allowing to be used, land for the Purpose of siting a moveable dwelling unless he holds a licence granted by the Council. The conditions attaching to licences granted relate to the number of moveable dwellings which may be kept on any Particular area of land ; the amount of free space between the dwellings; the provision of a water supply, sanitary conveniences, adequate paving, dustbin accommodation, fire protection arrangements and the prevention of nuisance from noise. The three sites in the Borough are regularly inspected, and during the year 305 inspections were made. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. This Act gives power generally to the Council to require steps to be taken to eradicate infestation of rats and mice and where possible to prevent infestations occurring. These duties are carried out by the Rodent Officer, assisted by two Rodent Operatives. 26 All infestations coming to light, whether by way of complaint or otherwise, are systematically investigated, and the appropriate action taken. Where the cause of the trouble is obviously defective drains or other defects in the building, the owner is called upon to effect the necessary repairs. This aspect of the work involves close co-operation between the Rodent Control Staff and the Public Health Inspectors. In the case of private dwellings the work of disinfestation is carried out by the Rodent Control StafE free of cost, and on request at business premises, where the cost is charged in full. The baiting of sewers under the control of the Council is undertaken three times during the year. Similar work is carried out by all London Boroughs, and has the result of reducing the rat population not completely, but to an irreducible minimum. The following table shows the number of premises inspected which were found to be infested with rats or mice : — Infested by Property Rats Mice Major Minor Major Minor Council's properties — 13 2 — Dwelling houses — 110 11 24 Business premises — 86 20 60 — 209 33 84 The total number of visits made to the above premises, and to others which were found not to be infested, was 2,992. Verminous Premises. During the year 271 premises which were found to be infested with vermin were disinfested. The insecticide used contains Pybuthrin and Lindane/D.D.T. and gives a prolonged residual effect. Dangerous Structures. During the course of inspection for any purpose carried out by the officers of the Department, should any dangerous structure or any dangerous condition appertaining to a building be noticed, the District Surveyor of the London County Council is notified for any action he may decide to take. 108 such cases were notified. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951. The principal provisions of the Act relate to registration of premises in which rag flock or other materials are used in upholstery, etc., and the licensing of premises used for the manufacture and storage of rag flock. An authorised officer of the Council has the right of entry, inspection and sampling of any filling materials. The Medical Officer of Health and Public Health Inspectors are deemed to be authorised officers. Subsequent Regulations made by the Minister prescribed the standard of cleanliness for each kind of filling material, the methods of testing samples and the nature of the tests to be applied. 27 There are 4 premises in the Borough at which filling materials other than rag flock are used, and these are registered. There are no premises at present dealing with rag flock. Nine visits were made to registered premises during the year, but no contravention of the Act was discovered. Rag Dealers and Sorters. Premises occupied by rag sorters in the Borough are subjected to regular inspection. During the year 110 inspections were made. Offensive Trades. There are two premises in the Borough at which the scheduled offensive trade of fat melting is carried on. The firms concerned have been established for many years, and the trades are conducted satisfactorily. Local Land Charges. Enquiries relating to Local Land Charges in connection with Notices served by the Department, information concerning the issue of Disrepair Certificates, and the way in which premises are drained, are regularly received. These enquiries require a careful search of records and drainage plans. During the year, 1,893 enquiries were dealt with. Shops Act, 1950. Since the transfer of certain functions under Section 38 of the Shops Act, 1950, from the London County Council to the Borough Council, inspection of all shops in the Borough is in hand to bring existing information up to date. During the year 205 inspections were made and three notices were served. One application for an exemption certificate in respect of sanitary conveniences was received in connection with a small lock-up shop where restricted space precluded the provision on the premises of such accommodation. The Council's public conveniences are within one hundred yards of the shop, and the applicants state that the one employee at the premises had permission to close the shop whenever necessary, and the application was therefore granted. Offices Act, 1960. This Act comes into force on the 1st January, 1962. Regulations will be made to secure the health, safety and welfare of persons employed in offices. When the Act is in force, it will be necessary to post in a prominent place accessible to all persons employed at any office a copy of any prescribed abstract of the Act or Regulation made. The Health Committee have been authorised by the Council to exercise on the Council's behalf the powers and duties conferred upon them by the Act. 28 Housing. Provision of New Accommodation. During the year 1960 construction of the following dwellings was completed:— 136 new By the Battersea Borough Council: — Dwellings 17, 19, 21, 23 Alfriston Road 4 1-55 Arthur Newton House, Winstanley Estate 55 1-6 Baker House, Winstanley Estate 6 1-16 Langhurst House, Battersea Park Estate 16 1-19 Lodsworth House, Battersea Park Estate 19 1-16 Mayford Close, Mayford Road 16 1-16 Powrie House, Battersea High Street 16 132 By London County Council:— Keeper's Lodge, Clapham Common West Side 1 Warden's and Caretaker's House, Battersea College of Technology Hall of Residence, Albert Bridge Road 1 2 By Private Owners:— 1, 3 Wayland Road 2 2 Total 136 Slum Clearance. During the year, representations for slum clearance were made in respect of 27 areas, 249 premises being represented out of 959 inspected. Of the 27 areas concerned 23 were situated in the Winstanley Road area, and the remaining 4 were in the Battersea Park Road area These latter were the Weybridge Street Nos. 1, 2 and 3 Areas and the Henley Street Area. The representations of the 23 areas in the Winstanley Road district followed the survey of the whole area carried out in 1959, to which reference was made in the Annual Report for that year. The areas concerned were as follows : — Winstanley Road Nos. 1 to 8 Areas. Creek Street Nos. 1, 2 and 3 Areas. Lavender Road Nos. 1 to 4 Areas. Meyrick Road Nos. 1 to 4 Areas. Newcomen Road Area. Grant Road Nos. 1, 2 and 3 Areas. Compulsory Purchase Orders in respect of Speke Road (No. 1) Area and the Battersea High Street (No. 1—North) Area were confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government following Public Inquiries. These Orders included seven areas which had been represented for slum clearance in 1959. Inspections made in connection with slum clearance during 1960 totalled 734. 29 Demolition Orders. No Demolition Orders under Section 17 of the Housing Act, 1957, were made during the year. Closing Orders. Under Section 17 of the Housing Act, 1957, 12 Closing Orders in respect of dwelling houses were made during the year, and 19 basement rooms were closed under Section 18 of the Act. Court proceedings were instituted against two persons in respect of a house and part of a house which had been re-occupied in contravention of the Closing Orders. In the first case fines amounting to £25 were imposed, with £7 10s. Od. costs. The second case was still awaiting a hearing at the end of the year. Overcrowding. Seven cases of overcrowding creating offences against the provisions of Section 78 of the Housing Act, 1957, were investigated and appropriate action taken to secure the abatement of the overcrowding. Certificates of Disrepair. Rent Act, 1957. The following table shows the work carried out during the year in connection with Certificates of Disrepair:— Applications for Certificates of Disrepair (Form I) received 54 Decisions to issue Certificates of Disrepair (Form J) 51 Undertakings received from landlords (Form K) 42 Undertakings received from landlords (Form K) accepted 39 Certificates of Disrepair (Form L) issued) 18 Certificates of Disrepair refused Nil Applications for cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair (Form M) received 32 Cancellations of Certificates of Disrepair (Form N) issued 29 Applications for Certificates re undertakings (Form O) received from landlords 23 Applications for Certificates re undertakings (Form O) received from tenants 4 Certificates re undertakings (Form P) issued to landlords 25 Certificates re undertakings (Form P) issued to tenants 10 Inspections carried out 153 The number of applications received for the issue, and for cancellation, of Certificates of Disrepair, and for Certificates re undertakings, showed a marked decrease when compared with the previous year, as did the number of Certificates of Disrepair cancelled during the year. At the end of 1960 there was still 148 Certificates of Disrepair in force. Housing Accommodation Applications. All applications made to the Council are normally dealt with by the Housing Manager, who refers to me those cases in which the application is based wholly or partly on medical grounds. These cases 30 include applications for transfer from Council tenants. He also refers certain cases in which some special feature is involved (e.g., fitness of basement rooms). During 1960 a total of 425 cases were dealt with on the grounds of ill-health or unsuitable accommodation. The maximum number of points on medical grounds other than pulmonary tuberculosis were allocated to 20 applications and 16 cases were referred to the Housing Committee for special consideration on these grounds. In 5 cases the maximum points were given for pulmonary tuberculosis, 4 of these being referred to the Housing Committee for special consideration as the accommodation was inadequate. In 18 cases of transfer applications, rehousing was recommended as essential on medical grounds. The London County Council notify cases in which the application to that Council alleges sanitary defects. The houses are inspected, and action to secure the remedy of any defects found is taken. 31 Factories and Outworkers. Factories Act, 1937. Metropolitan Borough Councils are responsible for the enforcement of the provisions of this Act in regard to:— (i) Sanitary conveniences—Section 7—In all factories. (ii) Cleanliness, Overcrowding, Temperature, Ventilation, and Drainage of Floors—Sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6—In all factories where mechanical power is not used.

There were 12 bakehouses on the register at the end of the year, eight having been closed during the year. All these are classed as factories, and 10 of them use mechanical power. Thirty-four inspections were made but it was not necessary to serve any notices. Three of the bakehouses were "basement bakehouses" within the meaning of Section 54 of the Factories Act, 1937. 35 Atmospheric Pollution. Clean Air Act, 1956. Smoke Control Areas. No. 1 Area. The Council's No. 1 Smoke Control Order became operative on the 1st October, 1959, but the Council decided to allow an extension of time for the receipt of applications up to the 31st March, 1960. At that date, a total of 260 applications for grants had been approved in respect of the estimated costs of adaptations to 502 fireplaces. By the end of the year work had been satisfactorily completed in 257 cases -163 by owners and 94 by tenants, and grants amounting to £2,823 18s. l0d. had been paid. Fifteen applications for payment of extra grant in addition to the statutory seven-tenths or seven-twentieths grant, on the grounds of hardship, were approved, the additional cost to the Council being £46 7s. 7d. No. 2 Area. This Area adjoins and forms an extension of No. 1 Area. It is almost entirely residential, bounded by Nightingale Lane to the south side, and Broomwood Road (odd numbers) to the north, and to the limits of the Borough boundaries on Wandsworth Common and Clapham Common. The Area comprises approximately 237 acres, of which 96 acres are Common land. There are no industrial premises. Dwellings number 1,800, and properties other than residential comprise 11 business Premises, 2 hostels, 2 schools, 2 nursing homes, a nurses home and training establishment, a private home for elderly ladies, and a London County Council Superintendent's lodge. The new college recently built on Clapham Common, West Side, has been equipped with oil-fired boilers. From a detailed survey of the Area, it was estimated that 5,756 fireplaces require replacement or adaptation, and if these are all the subject of applications for grants, the cost to the Council would be approximately £25,513. However, from experience in the No. 1 Area, the final cost to the Council is likely to be much less than this figure, as it is not expected that all the fireplaces mentioned above will be the subject of requests for grants. The Council's No. 2 Smoke Control Order has been submitted to the minister of Housing and Local Government, whose approval is awaited. One objection to the Order was received, but this was subsequently withdrawn, and it was not necessary for a Public Inquiry to In connection with the No. 1 and No. 2 Areas, a total of 3,111 visits and inspections were made during the year. Smoke, etc., Nuisances and Observations. During the year, 24 complaints were made alleging nuisances from smoke, dust, grit, etc., emitted from premises in various parts of the Borough. All these complaints received careful and sometimes prolonged investigation. In addition to dealing with specific complaints, observations are kept upon the chimneys of any industrial plant which merits observation, and the appropriate action taken. A total number of 225 obserations were made. No notices were served. 36 Smoke Measuring Station. The smoke measuring station installed in the Department in 1956 continues to give valuable information concerning smoke density and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere. The readings are taken by members of the staff of the Department, and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research receive the results and collate the information with other results obtained from Authorities all over the Country. The following graphs show the readings obtained throughout 1959 and 1960. 37 Notification of Installation of Furnaces. Notification is required under Section 3 of the Clean Air Act, 1956, of the installation of any furnace with a heating capacity of 55,000 B.T.U's or more per hour. The Section does not generally apply to furnaces designed solely or mainly for use for domestic purposes. The Purpose of the Section is to see that any new furnaces installed shall be so far as is practicable, capable of being operated without emitting smoke. Four notifications were received with respect to oil-fired furnaces, and in the case of one of these, the approval of the Council was sought. With regard to this application, plans and specifications were submitted. The plant was fully automatic, but provision was made for manual operation in the event of breakdown. Smoke density equipment was provided, with an alarm bell. The application was approved. One notification was in connection with the installation of an incinerator, and this has been functioning satisfactorily since its installation. Exemption of Premises engaged in Investigation and Research. Section 21 of the Clean Air Act, 1956, provides for firms engaged in research with regard to air pollution and the efficiency of furnaces generally to apply for exemption in the event of emission of smoke above the prescribed density. One application for exemption under this Section was received, and this was granted for one year. No untoward emissions were observed. Alkali, etc., Works Order, 1958. This Order came into operation in June, 1958, and extends the list of works scheduled under the Alkali, etc., Works Regulation Act, 1906. The additions are extensive, and the list of works to be controlled by the Order has been notified to the Council by the Minister. the effect of the Order is to place these works under the control of the Alkali Inspector, and proceedings cannot be instituted by the Council in respect of smoke or grit upon the premises except with the consent of the Minister. 38 Protection of Food Supply. (A)—INSPECTION OF FOOD PREMISES. The regular inspection of all premises where food for human consumption is sold or stored is carried out as a routine. The Food and Drugs Act, 1955, and regulations made thereunder, is the principal Act under which action is taken. FOOD PREMISES. As at 31st December, 1960. Milk Distributors 135 Wholesale Milk Dealers (registered as Dairymen) 1 Restaurants, Cafés 147 Canteens, Kitchens 77 Butchers 63 Horseflesh (for human consumption) 1 Ice Cream (Sale) 264 Ice Cream (Manufacture) 9 Fish Shops (Wet and Fried) 42 Food Factories 21 Bakehouses (Not underground) 9 Bakehouses (Underground) 3 Preserved Food 111 Bakers 51 Greengrocers 86 Confectioners 213 Grocers and Provisions 261 Miscellaneous (Chemists, Public Houses, Off-Licences) Stalls :— 205 Grocers 3 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 56 Fish and/or Poultry 6 There are 1,089 food premises in the Borough, together with 65 food stalls. Some of the premises shown above are listed under more than one trade category. Dairies and Milk Distributors. At the end of the year there were 136 premises in the Borough registered for the sale of milk. One of these premises, occupied by a wholesale dealer, was registered as a dairy. The occupiers of the remaining 135 premises were registered as milk distributors. All these premises were visited during the year, and 4 notices concerning non-compliance with the Food Hygiene Regulations were served. Milk (Special Designation) Regulations. The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960, which came into force on the 1st October, 1960, replace and consolidate, with amendments, previous Regulations made between 1949 and 1954. 39 The main changes brought about by the new Regulations, insofar as they affect the Council, are as follows:— (a) Dealers' licences will be granted by the food and drugs authority for the area within which are situated the premises at or from which the milk is to be pasteurised, sterilised or sold. (b) Dealers' licences will permit sales outside as well as inside the area of the licensing authority, and supplementary licences are therefore discontinued. (c) A Dealers' (Pre-packed Milk) licence is introduced to permit the sale of all three kinds of specially designated milk where the milk is obtained by the dealer in the container in which it is to be supplied to the consumer, or is pasteurised or sterilised by the dealer. (d) The period for which a dealer's licence is granted is extended from one year to five years. These changes operate as from the 1st January, 1961. In addition, new and modified tests for tuberculin tested and Pasteurised milk have been introduced. The number of licences issued under the previous Regulations during 1960 was as follows — Full Supplementary Tuberculin Tested 88 21 Pasteurised 107 21 Sterilised 132 23 327 65 One licence to sterilise milk was issued, and is included in the above figures, but the firm concerned discontinued business during the year, and no milk is now sterilised in the Borough. Ice Cream Premises. Section 16 (a) of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, provides for the registration of premises used for the sale, or manufacture for the purpose of sale, of ice cream, or the storage of ice cream intended for sale. The number of premises registered at the end of the year was 273. Prior to registration, the premises are inspected as to suitability before recommendation to the Health Committee. The majority of applications are for the sale of pre-packed ice cream from refrigerated containers. Particular attention is paid to premises where manufacture takes place, and samples of the product are taken for examination. There are 9 premises in the Borough where ice cream is manufactured. Butchers' Shops. There are 64 butchers' shops in the Borough. All these shops are systematically inspected, 2,133 visits having been made during the year. Two notices concerning non-compliance with the Food Hygiene Regulations were served. One shop where horseflesh is sold for human food is included among the butchers' shops mentioned above. One case of an employee in a butcher's shop who was seen to be smoking a cigarette, which is an offence under the Food Hygiene Regulations, was reported to the Health Committee, who instructed that the case should be dealt with by a cautionary letter. 40 Fish Shops. Shops in which fish, either cooked or uncooked, is sold, or where the curing or smoking of fish is carried on, are regularly inspectedThere are 42 such shops in the Borough. 139 inspections were made, and 3 notices served in respect of breaches of the Food Hygiene Regulations. Preserved Food Premises. Section 16 (b) of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, provides for the registration of premises used for the preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food intended for sale. A total of 111 premises were registered at the end of the year. In addition to butchers' and fish shops, 9 inspections of other preserved food premises were carried out. Four notices under the Food Hygiene Regulations were served. Catering Establishments. All restaurants, cafes, canteens and kitchens are regularly inspected throughout the year. There are 224 of these premises on the Register, and 762 inspections were made, 5 notices under the Food Hygiene Regulations being served. Food Stalls. All street stalls from which food for human consumption is sold are regularly inspected and, where the food sold is stored in the Borough, the storage places are also inspected. There are 65 food stalls, the majority of them being in the two street markets in Battersea High Street and Northcote Road. FOOD PREMISES. Summary of Operations.

The analysis of samples of food and drugs purchased formally and informally under the Food and Drugs Act is carried out by the Public Analyst for the Borough, J. E. Woodhead, Esq., B.SC., F.R.I.C., ph.c., at his laboratory at 325 Kennington Road, London, S.E.11. 41 General bacteriological examination, and the examination of samples of heat-treated milk and of ice-cream, is carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service. The total number of formal samples taken under the Act during 1960 was 256, of which 5, or 1.9 per cent., were certified to be Adulterated. In addition, 190 informal samples were procured, of which 1, or 0.5 per cent., was certified to be adulterated. The percentages of samples reported by the Public Analyst to be adulterated during the quinquennia 1921 to 1960 are given in the following table. The year under review is shown separately. Year Formal samples (per cent.) Informal samples (per cent.)

One hundred formal samples of milk were taken during the year. Of the 100 samples, 27 were designated as " Channel Islands " or "South Devon" milk, for which a higher minimum percentage (viz., 4 per cent.) of milk fat content is provided for under arrangements made between the producers and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. All of these samples were reported to be in conformity with this standard, their average composition being:— Milk fat 4.42 per cent. Non-fatty solids 9.00 Total milk solids 13.42 The milk fat content of the 27 samples of "Channel Islands" or "South Devon" milk ranged as under:— between 4.7 and 4.8 per cent. 2 samples. „ 4.6 „ 4.7 „ 3 „ „ 4.5 „ 4.6 „ 6 „ „ 4.4 „ 4.5 „ 5 „ „ 4.3 „ 4.4 „ 7 „ „ 4.2 „ 4.3 „ 1 sample. „ 4.1 „ 4.2 „ 2 samples. „ 4.0 „ 4.1 „ 1 sample. 27 42 All the 73 samples of ordinary milk were reported as genuine and the average composition was as follows:— Milk fat 3.65 per cent.

One informal sample and one formal sample of Golden Raising Powder were found to be deficient in available carbon di-oxide to extent of 40 per cent. Upon investigation, it was found that the commodity had been in the retailer's shop for two years. Following a representation to the retailer, the stock was withdrawn from sale. Four formal samples of sausages and preserved meat were found to contain a lower percentage of meat than what is generally agreed they should contain. As there is no statutory requirement in this matter, action was taken by cautioning the manufacturers. 45 Heat Treated Milk. Samples of pasteurised and sterilised milk are taken at regular intervals for submission to the Public Health Laboratory Service for the prescribed tests, and during the year samples as under were taken with the results set out:— Phosphatase Methylene Blue Satisfactory Failed Satisfactory Failed Pasteurised 39 — 39 — Turbidity Satisfactory Failed Sterilised 18 — Monthly returns of the samples taken, and of the results of the examinations, are sent to the Milk Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and they are at once notified of any adverse report. Ice-Cream. Twenty-eight samples of ice-cream were taken during the year, each sample being submitted to the methylene blue test. The samples were, as a result of the test, placed in the following grades: Provisional Grade 1 14 „ „ 2 11 „ „ 3 2 „ „ 4 1 28 Where samples of ice-cream made at premises in the Borough received unsatisfactory reports, the premises, plant, and methods of operation are examined, and, where possible, improvements are suggested. Foreign Matter in Food. There were two instances of foreign matter in food dealt with during the year. In the first case, a bottle of milk was found to contain a piece of silver foil paper. Bacteriological examination showed that the contents of the bottle were sterile, the silver paper having passed through the bottle washing process. In the second case, a metal split-pin was found in a loaf of bread. THe firm of bakers concerned stated that the split-pin must have worked loose from one of the many belts and machines in use in the bakehouse, although they were unable to confirm this completely. Their Engineering Department had been given all possible instructions to prevent a recurrence. This was the first occasion any complaint had been received concerning this firm. In both instances the Health Committee instructed that a cautionary letter should be sent to the firms concerned. 46 The following table gives particulars of the unsound food which, under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, Section 180 (8), were voluntarily surrendered to the Council.

Four cases of food poisoning were notified during the year, and the causative organisms were found to be salmonella of the following types:— Bovis morbifican 1 St. Paul 1 Typhi murium 2 There was no connection between any of these cases, and it was not possible to determine what food was the source of the organisms. 47 Miscellaneous Matters.

The general routine work of the Department in relation to the aged continued along the lines which have been described in previous reports. Numerous health and social problems have been referred to the Health Department from many sources. The basic aim is to prevent physical deterioration and breakdown by providing help through the service which are concerned with the welfare of old people, and also enlisting the co-operation of the old persons themselves. Perhaps, however, the greatest step forward during the year was the consideration given to the future long-term plans to help the old people in Battersea. It became apparent during the year that if more was to be done, more money would have to be provided, and accordingly the Borough Council increased its grant payable to the Battersea Old People's Welfare Committee up to £3,000 in the financial year ending March 1961. At the same time, considerable thought was given to the best way by which the purely social work in relation to old people could be carried out, and as a result the existing Old People's Welfare Committee was reconstituted, and the new Committee had its first meeting on the 7th November, 1960. The new Committee draws its members from a very wide field, and includes representatives of practically every service and agency who may be concerned with the health and welfare of old People. It is thus a very broadly based Committee, and its members are able to draw on a wide and comprehensive wealth of experience. There is no doubt that in the years to come this will 48 greatly benefit the many old people in the area. Indeed, plans were already put in hand to strengthen the social services by way of providing cheap holidays, an Old People's Home, and also Community Centres. It is satisfactory to note that in the present financial year the amount of money to be made available has been considerably increased above the original £3,000. While the facilities for old people in Battersea were in many ways a pioneer service (for instance the Meals on Wheels service), this extension of the work, backed by strong finances and a keen and experienced Committee, will enable many new and important steps forward to be taken, and it may be confidently expected that in the years to come the facilities and services available for old people in Battersea will be still further extended and enhanced. It is a privilege to be able to acknowledge in this Report the outstanding contributions, both of time and experience, that the members of the Old People's Voluntary Committee have made and are making to this most important work. Removal under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948. One of the more unpleasant duties of the Public Health Department is to arrange, when necessary, for the compulsory removal of an old person living under poor conditions and suffering from chronic illness to hospital. This is a duty which we try to avoid, and in most cases are successful, for it is possible usually, in conjunction with the patient's own doctor, to persuade the old person that his/her health requires that they should enter hospital. Unfortunately, occasionally our efforts are in vain, and when it is quite clear that it is in the best interests of the old person that he should be taken to hospital in spite of his refusal to accept advice, then a Magistrate's Order must be obtained. It was necessary to take such action in only two cases during the year, and in one of these after steps had been taken to obtain a Magistrate's Order, the old lady decided she would go to hospital voluntarily. This particular old lady did very well in hospital, and eventually was discharged back to her home. Unfortunately, the other case died some time after admission. In handling the problems which arise in connection with the care of old people, particularly where the possibility of admission to hospital arises, we work very closely with the family doctor and the hospitals, especially St. John's Hospital, Battersea. This hospital has a first-class geriatric unit where outstandingly good work has been done for old people admitted. I should like to take the opportunity of expressing the thanks of the Battersea Public Health Department to the hospital, particularly to Dr. Sthyr, the Physician Superintendent, and his staff, for the great help we have received. Many old people are seen by Dr. Sthyr himself in their own homes, and everything is done to help the old person and reassure him about conditions in the hospital. An increasing number of old people are now being admitted to this hospital, where they do so well that they are able to return to their own homes rehabilitated and very much better in health, both physically and mentally, than when they entered the hospital. Indeed, the feeling which at one time was quite widespread that once an old person was admitted to hospital he never came out is now far from being the case, and many old people are admitted for possibly quite short periods, with much benefit both physically and mentally. 49 Use of Slipper Baths by Old Age Pensioners. The Council make available to old age pensioners free use of the silpper baths at their Baths Establishments (with use of a towel) on production of their pension books. This facility has also been extended to blind persons. During the year 1960 this arrangement was taken advantage of the respective Baths Establishments as follows:— Males Females Latchmere 3,621 3,120 Nine Elms 998 452 Plough Road 1,298 1,320 Total 5,917 4,892 Accidents in the Home. The following tables, compiled from reports made by the London Ambulance Service, indicate the number of accidents occurring in Battersea each year since 1956. Table I shows the number of accidents in age groups; Table II gives the numbers from various causes. HOME ACCIDENTS IN BATTERSEA, 1956-1960. Table I Year Age group (years) M. F.

Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council are responsible for the burial or cremation of the body of any Person dying, or being found dead, in the Borough, and have power to recover from the estate of the deceased person, or from any person who, under the Act, was liable to maintain the deceased immediately prior to his death, their expenses incurred in carrying out the duty, in so far as these expenses are not covered by any grant made under the National Insurance Act, 1946. During the year, 7 cases were dealt with. The burials arranged by the Council are carried out by a local undertaker under contract, and not more than one coach is provided for followers. The Health Department make the arrangements and collect all available information regarding any estate left by the deceased particulars of his National Insurance, and the existence of any "liable" relatives. This information is passed to the Borough Treasurer so that he may take steps to recover the cost. The total cost incurred in dealing with the 7 cases was £9 approximately, and of this amount £79 was recovered. 51 Barbers and Hairdressers. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954—Section 18. The Council, under the provisions of the above-named Section, registers all barbers and hairdressers and their premises. At the end of the year there were 70 registered premises in the Borough, and 141 inspections were carried out. Pet Animals Act, 1951. The object of the Act is to regulate the sale of pet animals, with particular reference to their welfare whilst kept for sale in pet shops. A pet shop may not be kept except under the authority of a licence granted in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Licences were issued in respect of 12 shops and 20 visits were made during the year. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952. Regulations under the above Act prescribe that heating appliances suitable for use in dwelling house or other residential premises shall be fitted with robustly made guard securely attached to the appliance, and shall satisfy certain other tests set out in a Schedule to the Regulations. It has been found, since the passing of the Act, that almost withtout exception appliances on sale are sold to a British Standard specification, which gives the double assurance of their being subject to inspection at the place of manufacture. Occasional cases of second-hand appliances of an old type being offered for sale may occur, however, and a constant watch is kept for such appliances. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933. This Act is chiefly concerned with the distribution by sale or otherwise of Poisonous substances. The list of poisons is contained in an Order made under the Act. This Order is divided into Part I and Part II. With the poisons contained in Part I, the Council are not concerned since an "authorised seller" is a pharmacist registered with the Pharmaceutical Society, and enforcement is entrusted to Inspectors appointed by that Society. Substances specified in Part II may be sold by "listed sellers", and these are persons who, on written application in a prescribed form, and no Payment of stated fees, are recorded by the Council as "persons entitled to sell poisons in Part II of the Poisons List" at the premises recorded in the List. The Council are required to enforce the Act and Orders so far as they relate to "listed sellers" and have appointed the Public Health Inspectors as Inspectors under the Act. There are at present 82 persons registered under the Act. Oil Burners (Standards) Act, 1960. This Act comes into effect on the 1st January, 1961, and under it Regulation are to be made requiring oil heaters to comply with specified standards of safety. Provision is made for the prohibition of the sale of oil heaters or component parts which do not comply with the regulations, and for inspection and testing. 52 The manufacturers of oil heaters are at the present time producing a heater which meets the requirements of B.S.3300—a new British standard for oil heaters. The manufacturer of such a heater incorporates with his particular sign the "Kite" mark of the British Standards Institution. This is a guarantee of safety, and a guide to the buyer. Some heaters already in use can be modified to improve draught resistance and consequent safety by conversion kits obtainable from the makers, although some existing heaters are not easily converted. Public Swimming Baths. The Council maintain four public swimming pools—three at Latchmere Baths and one at Nine Elms Baths. The source of water supply at the Latchmere Baths is from deep wells. In the event of breakdown or any temporary cessation of supply from the wells, the water is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. The Nine Elms Baths are supplied from the Board's mains. The Bath water is effectively chlorinated, and there is a turnover or change of water in the Baths approximately every 3½ hours. Samples of water from the swimming pools are taken at fortnightly intervals and submitted for bacteriological examination. The results have been consistently satisfactory. Public Lavatory Accommodation. Five public conveniences for both sexes and one for females only are provided by the Council in various parts of the Borough, two being underground. All the lavatory accommodation at each of the conveniences is provided free, and, in the interests of public health, free washing facilities are also available. Two public urinals are maintained, and in addition the urinals attached to nine licensed premises are, by arrangement with the owners available to the general public. Disinfection and Disinfestation. Methods of Disinfection: Following the notification of a case of infectious disease requiring disinfection, an inspection is made and the following methods used. The patient's room is sprayed with a formaldehyde solution. The doors and windows are closed and the room can be used again after five or six hours. Bedding and clothing are collected and steam treated at the Station. where the disinfection plant consists of two large steam disinfectors. Sheets, pillow cases and hand towels are exposed to formalin vapour in a special chamber prior to being washed in the adjoining laundry. Books and other articles which cannot be steam disinfected also treated by exposure to a formalin vapour. Disinfestation of Verminous Rooms : Articles in the room requiring treatment are removed for steam disinfestation. The room is sprayed with an insecticide containing Pybuthrin and Lindane/D.D.T., which gives a prolonged residual effect. In the case of a heavy infestation, architraves and mouldings are required to be eased for deeper penetration of the insecticide. Control of Insect Pests: The construction by the Council of large blocks of flats containing covered ducts taking hot water, plumbing and drainage pipes has raised a problem of insect infestation. These ducts form an ideal harbourage for insects which would be difficult 53 to deal with by normal hand spraying. A Microsol Mist Generator has been purchased by the Council, and this fitting, having a small motor unit, is capable of spraying a fine mist or fog of insecticide to a distance of 50 feet, the mist settling out on to the surfaces of the duct and the piping contained therein. This fitting is in use and is proving very successful. Personal Cleansing Station. There are facilities for treatment of scabies and verminous conditions at the Personal Cleansing Station, Sheepcote Lane. During the year 297 treatments were given to persons suffering from or contacts of scabies—77 to adults, 185 to school children, and 35 to children under school age. In addition to the above, 65 adults and 420 children found to be verminous were cleansed. Of the 420 children, 380 attended from local schools by arrangement with the London County Council, who have entered into a contract with the Council for the use of the Personal Cleansing Station. The cleansing and treatment of the school children is carried out under the supervision of officers of the London Country Council, while the disinfestation of clothing and, if necessary, of the homes is carried out by the Borough Council's staff. The following table shows the number of treatments at the Personal Cleansing Station and the expenditure incurred since 1950:— Year Adults Children *Expenditure *Amount Contributed Verminous and Scabies Verminous and Scabies £ £ 1950 226 2,238 1,750 410 1951 200 1,858 1,992 406 1952 176 1,994 1,956 535 1953 144 1,943 1,932 508 1954 214 2,499 1,966 512 1955 246 2,318 2,371 526 1956 262 1,517 2,681 547 1957 289 1,535 3,202 553 1958 288 1,756 2,536 560 1959 221 1,259 2,259 560 1960 142 640 2,529 545 Financial year ending 31st March. Other columns, calendar year. It will be seen that the decrease in the numbers of adults and children treated which occurred in 1959 was even more marked in 1960. The contract with the London County Council, referred to above, provides for the payment by them of 3s. 6d. for each treatment given, whether for vermin or for scabies, with a minimum payment of £ £500 per annum. 54 Arrangements have been made with the Wandsworth Borough Council, and the Lambeth Borough Council, for certain of the residents in those Boroughs, who require treatment or cleansing, to attend at the Battersea Personal Cleansing Station, the cost of this service being borne by the respective Boroughs in which the patients are resident. During the year 62 treatments were given to Wandsworth resident and 48 treatments to Lambeth residents. Methods of Treatment:— Scabies: Persons attending for treatment are given a hot bath for twenty to thirty minutes, thoroughly dried, and Benzyl Benzoate applied to the whole of the body. This is repeated on alternate days, there being three treatments in all. Verminous heads: The hair is treated with a preparation containing cotton-seed oil, tar oil, paraffin oil and oil of lemon grass, and then washed with a shampoo of soft soap and borax. It is then dried thoroughly, combed with a Sacker's comb to remove nits, washed. dried and combed again. The operation takes approximately half an hour for each child, and a final check is made by the Sister in attendance. The Council have two flats attached to the Personal Cleansing Station for the temporary use in emergency of people or a family displaced, usually following fumigating procedure. The Council have agreed that these shelters may be used for Wandsworth residents at an annual fee of £25 for the right to use the shelters and a weekly charge of £1 10s. 0d. per shelter for every case sent there. 55 Coroner's Court and Mortuary. Details as to the number of inquests held at the Coroner's Court, and bodies received into the Mortuary, during 1960, are set out in following table : — Details of Bodies Received Usual Place of Residence Total Batter- sea Wandsworth Elsewhere Residence unknown Post-mortem only 191 552 145 2 890 Post-mortem and inquest 18 90 49 2 159 Total post-mortems 209 642 194 4 1049 Inquest only - - - - - Total inquests 18 90 49 2 159 Sanitary and other reasons 2 2 — 1 5 Total bodies received 211 644 194 5 1054 Verdicts at Inquests held- Occident and misadventure 8 47 35 — 90 Alcoholism — 2 — — 2 Natural causes — 2 1 1 4 Open verdict — 3 2 1 6 Suicide 10 34 5 — 49 deferred to higher court — 2 6 — 8 total 18 90 49 2 159 In addition to the above, a further twenty-one inquests were held at the Coroner's Court in respect of which no bodies were received into the Mortuary. The Wandsworth Borough Council made a grant of £500 per annum towards the cost of maintaining the Mortuary. The London County Council pay a rent of £525 per annum for the use of the Coroner's Court. 56 INDEX.
