Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I beg to present to you the Yearly Report on the Health and Sanitation of your District during 1937. The District is divided into three Wards : Bedfont, Feltham and Hanworth, with a total acreage of 4935. The estimated population is 28,700 (mid. 1937), Registrar General). The day population is increased by people working at the various factories and shops. A small number continue to work at agriculture. The Southern Railway employ a considerable number. The population is increasing by about 2,000 a year. They are attracted by the new houses which are being built. The majority of them earn their livings outside your area. Unemployment is slight. There are no slums. My estimate of the population is 40,000. The number of inhabited houses at the end of 1937 was 9279. The sum represented by a penny rate is £"865. All classes of inhabited houses 9279 Working-class dwellings 8650 New working-class dwellings erected 820 Total number of new houses erected 880 2 Vital Statistics. Live Births— Total. Male. Female.

There is a District Nurse for Feltham and Han worth, and a separate one for Bedfont. Illness other than Hospital cases are attended by these nurses and by private nurses, and by the relatives of the patients. Midwives. Six midwives are resident in your area, and others from surrounding districts attend cases. All are und -r ihe supervision of the Middlesex County Co ncil. Laboratory Facilities. Sputums for examination for Tuberculosis aie sent to the Middlesex County Council Dispensary at Hounslow. Swabs for Diphtheria and other infectious material are sent to the Royal Hospital at Richmond. Hospitals. Acute cases are taken to Hounslow, Richmond, Windsor and Staines Hospitals. Some cases, especially maternity, are admitted to the West Middlesex Hospital at Isleworth The arrangements are satisfactory Maternity Homes. One is licensed in your district. It is supervised by the Middlesex County Council. Ambulance Facilities. An Ambulance is stationed at Bridge House. It is available day and night. Infectious cases are removed by Special Ambulance belonging to the Staines Joint Isolation Hospital. Clinic and Treatment Centres. The School Medical Officer appointed by the Middlesex County Council holds sessions once' or twice a week at Bedfont, Feltham and Hanworth. The children are inspected. Expectant and nursing mothers are advised. Free milk and other articles are issued free in necessitous cases, and others obtain them at half or cost price. Children from 1 to 5 years old are visited at their homes. The arrangements are adequate. The time has arrived when a permanent building should be erected. 6 Orthopaedic Treatment. Cases are sent to the various hospitals by the School Medical Officer, or by private practitioners. Milk Supply. All dairies, cowsheds and milk shops are periodically inspected and action taken where necessary. Samples of milk are taken for analysis. There are 8 dairies in your area. They are clean and well kept. The milk is of good quality. Sanitary Circumstances of the Area. Water Supply. Water is supplied to Bedfont and Feltham by the South West Suburban Water Co. of Egham, and to Kanworth by the Metropolitan Water Board. A few houses are still supplied by wells ; these houses should be connected to the main. The water has been analysed during the year on two occasions. The reports are satisfactory, and the supply adequate. Rivers and Streams. The River Crane passes through your district. It is contaminated outside your boundary. There is a nuisance from insects breeding along the banks. The whole river requires canalizing both within and without your district. This has partially been done by the Middlesex County Council in the Hanworth Ward. Drainage. Almost the whole district with the exception of Hatton is on the main sewer. Details are given in the report of the Sanitary Inspector. Swimming Baths- There are no swimming baths in your area. A paddling pool was opened in June 1937. The water is cleansed daily. The have been no complaints as regards the water. 7 Closet Accommodation. 22 pail closets have been abolished during the year. The drainage of 135 houses has been re-constructed. 107 cesspools have been abolished. Approximately 50 pail closets remain to be converted. Public Cleansing. See Chief Sanitary Inspector's Report. Shops. The Shops' Acts, 1912-1936 have been carried out by this department. Details in Chief Sanitary Inspector's Report. Smoke Abatement. No complaints received during the year. Schools. The water supply is from the. main and is satisfactory. The drainage is to the main sewer, with the exception of Bedfont School. The connection of the School drainage is a matter of urgency. Eradication of Bed Bugs- (1) The number of Council houses infested 33 The number of Council houses disinfested 33 The number of other houses infested 20 The number of other houses disinfested 20 (2) The methods employed of freeing infested houses from bugs are the removal of all wood-work and spraying with chemicals. (3) No definite methods were employed for ensuring that the belongings are free from vermin before removal to Council houses ; but the Council is now adopting effective means of treating household goods before a house is occupied. (4) The work of disinfestation is carried out by the local authority. 8 Housing. During 1937, 880 new houses were erected, of which 820 were working-class dwellings. There is still a demand for houses to be let at a weekly rental of 10/- or less. Under the new Overcrowding Laws, houses for the working-class, with 4 or 5 bedrooms, will have to be provided. There are still about 50 old houses which should be demolished. There are no slums in your area, other than those that are scheduled for clearance. For details of Inspections, see Appendix "A". In conclusion, Lady and Gentlemen, I beg to thank you for the way in which you have supported me in carrying out my duties, and to thank Mr. Rowdon, Mr. Bell, and the other Officials of the Council for their assistance. F. H. WOODS, Medical Officer of Health. 9 Annual Report of the Chief Sanitary Inspector for the year ended December 31st, 1937. Bridge House, Feltham. To Dr. F. H. WOODS, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I have the honour to present this my Seventh Annual Report dealing with the work carried out in connection with the administration of the various statutes and byelaws relating to Public Health in force in the District. Building in the District continues although not on so large a scale as last year. Estates are being developed in each of the three Wards, which it will be readily understood brings additional work. The usual practice has been continued of communicating with the responsible party immediately upon discovery of any sanitary defect and supplying detailed particulars of the work necessary to satisfactorily remedy same. It is gratifying to report that in no case has it been found necesary to resort to legal proceedings against any property owner for non-compliance with sanitary notices. Friendly discussions create a feeling of confidence between property owners and the Council, and usually lead to the removal of difficulties and misunderstanding. In connection with Infectious Disease, each case received has received prompt attention in disinfecting the rooms concerned. Drainage of Existing Houses. Some 135 have had the drainage re-constructed and connected to the Council's sewers. The cesspools have been emptied and either filled in or used as soakaways for yard or roof water. Sewerage and Sewage Disposal. The whole of the pumps (5) in the Hanworth Ward have been cut out, the sewage gravitating to the West Middlesex Scheme. 10 Bedfont and North Feltham Sewerage. Very few houses remain that have not had the drainage re-constructed and connected to the sewers which are available. No improvements have occured at the Northern portion of Bedfont on account of the proposed sewerage scheme not having commenced. House Refuse Collection. With the number of vehicles now provided, the house and trade refuse is being collected without difficulty. The tip at Hatton has been discontinued and tipping is taking place at the Council's Sewage Farm, which is carried out on the controlled system. Cesspool Cleansing This work is certainly very lessened. It will be impossible to do away with the Cesspool Exhauster altogether, there being a certain number of houses where there are no sewers. Shops' Acts, 1912-1936. To keep the Register up to date, it is necessary to continually go around the district to ascertain whether there has occurred a change of tenancy. Many shops have changed hands during the year and will probably continue to do so. Warnings have been given as to hours of closing, and also as to hours of juvenile employment. Dairies and Cowsheds. These are gradually getting smaller in number, apparently attributed to the combines. Slaughterhouses. There are nine licensed slaughterhouses in the District, and also one Knacker's Yard. The whole are kept in a clean state. Butchers Shops. There are 20 shops in the District during the year. These are kept in a satisfactory condition. 11 Fried Fish Shops. These are also being kept clean. A complaint received respecting the non removal of offal by the owner was immediately attended to, and no further complaint has been received. Housing Act, 1936—Overcrowding Provisions. This work continues to occupy a large part of the Assistants' time in supplying owners and agents with the prescribed number that each house can occupy. Clearance Orders- A large amount of preliminary work has been carried out in connection with the Council's scheme. Inspection of District- I desire to point out that to enable the Department to carry out the requirements of the Ministry of Health in a systematic and proper manner, it is most essential that an additional Inspector be appointed as early as possible. This work cannot be carried out with the present staff. I estimate that the population has increased since 1930 by about 22,000. In conclusion, I again desire to thank you, the Chairman, and members of the Public Health Committee, for the way they have supported me in carrying out my duties, and also to state that I fully appreciate the help of the Staff of the Department, and my colleagues of the other Departments for their ready assistance. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, H. J. ROWDON, Chief Sanitary Inspector. 12 Summary of Sanitary Work and Improvements. General Inspection during the Year 1937.
