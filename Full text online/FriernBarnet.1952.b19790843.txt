The Registrar-General estimated the population of the District to be 28,330, a decrease of 120 compared with 1951, and 930 compared with 1950. The provisional Census figure of population was 29,164. The present estimate of population is the lowest since 1946. -4- BIRTHS. The total of births during the year was 346, 14 more than last year. Of these births, 173 were males and 173 females. The Birth-Rate for the District was therefore 13.3 per 1000 of the population, but the correcting factor for age and sex distribution is 1.03 and this provided a Birth-Rate for comparative purposes of 13.7. The corresponding Birth-Rate for England & Wales was 15.3 and for London 17.6. Births and Birth-Rates for the past five years have been as follows:– Year. No. of Births. Birth-Rates. Friern Barnet. England & Wales. London. 1948 375 14.1 17.9 20.1 1949 388 14.4 16.7 18.5 1950 397 15.3 15.8 17.8 1951 332 12.9 15.5 17.8 1952 346 13.7 15.3 17.6 DEATHS. The number of deaths during the year was 298, but since the preparation of the Death-Table, the Registrar General assigned only 290 of these Deaths to the District, and this gave an uncorrected Death-Rate of 11.1 per 1000. The correcting factor for age and sex distribution is 0.98 thus the corrected Death-Rate for comparative purposes was 10.8 per 1000. The corresponding Death-Rate for England & Wales was 11.3 and for London 12.6. The total number of deaths was 6 higher than in the preceding year. 143 were males and 147 females. 187 deaths (65%) were of persons above the age of 65 years. Diseases of the heart and circulatory system were the chief causes of death. -5- An analysis of the causes of death will be found at the end of the Report. The Deaths and Death-Rates for the past five years have been:- Year. No. of Deaths. Death-Rates. Friern Barnet. England & Wales. London. 1948 232 9.0 10.8 11.6 1949 252 9.2 11.7 12.2 1950 267 9.8 11.6 11.8 1951 284 10.5 12.5 13.1 1952 290 10.8 11.3 12.6 There were 13 deaths of infants under 1 year of age, giving an Infantile Death-Rate of 37.5 per 1000 births, compared with 10 deaths and a rate of 30.1 in 1951. The comparative rates for England & Wales and for London were 27.6 and 23.8 respectively. Of the 13 infant deaths 10 occurred during the first week of life. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Details of the cases of infectious disease notified during 1952 will be found in the Tables at the end of the Report. The total of 357 cases was considerably lower than in 1951 when 497 cases were notified, but no significant changes took place and the reduction was due, in the main, to fewer cases of Measles, which as in other years accounted for more than half of the total cases of infectious disease in the District. Whilst the number of cases of Measles -6- notified during 1952 was less than in the previous year 195 compared with 317 - it should be reported that the epidemic of this infection which commenced in the last weeks of the year extended into 1953 and resulted in a total of 568 cases. Fortunately the type of disease was mild and of the 195 cases only one was admitted to hospital. Whooping Cough. There were fewer cases of this disease - 65 compared with 91 in the previous year. In one instance only was hospital treatment necessary. As the Council is aware a scheme for immunisation against Whooping Cough either alone or in conjunction with Diphtheria immunisation is provided by the Middlesex County Council. Scarlet Fever. Notifications during the year were 26, an increase of 2 over the number of cases in 1951, but well below the average of the last few years. The character of the disease was again very mild. For a number of years patients have been removed to hospital only when circumstances or conditions have made such action necessary, and in 1952 five cases were admitted. The infection was not limited to any particular period of the year or part of the District. Poliomyelitis. One case occurred during the year, the patient being a girl aged 8 years. There was no paralysis. Typhoid Fever. The one case notified occurred in the Friern Hospital. Dysentery. Of the 19 cases, 17 were patients in the Friern Hospital. Tuberculosis. The number of new cases of Tuberculosis reported during 1952 was 33 - being 28 pulmonary and 5 non-pulmonary. In addition 9 persons came to live in the District who had previously been notified as suffering from Tuberculosis whilst living in other areas. The total of cases added to the Register was 42, the same as in the previous year. -7- The distribution of the new cases among the wards was:- North South Central East West Friern Hospital 7 7 4 1 4 10 During the first two weeks of November, Mass X-Ray Unit No. 5B of the North West Regional Hospital Board visited Friern Barnet for the second year in succession. By arrangement with the Unit the Public Health Department invited the staffs of local factories, shops and other organisations to visit the Unit by appointment for chest X-Ray and acted as a booking centre for the public. The facilities whereby persons attending were X-rayed rapidly and without personal inconvenience were most acceptable and the sessions were well supported. During this period a total of 2486 persons attended. In view of the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of unsuspected cases the Mass X-Ray Unit makes a valuable contribution to the campaign against Tuberculosis and we hoped that it may be possible to arrange further and regular visits of a Unit to Friern Barnet. Diphtheria. For the fourth successive year there was no Diphtheria in the District. No excuse need be made for repeating that the control of this disease can be attributed very largely to immunisation, but it must be appreciated that this control is conditioned by support of the immunisation program. It might be recalled here that in the years 1938,1939,1940 and 1941, immediately preceding the introduction of a scheme of immunisation in Friern Barnet, the notified cases of Diphtheria were 48, 8, 31 and 49 respectively and resulted in 4 deaths. The local scheme is arranged by the Middlesex County Council as the Local Health Authority and provides for immunisation sessions at the various Welfare Clinics in the District, for special sessions at the schools, and for children to be immunised by their own medical attendant. During the year 341 were immunised against Diphtheria 191 at the Clinics organised by the County Council and 150 by their family doctors. In addition 425 children of school age received re-inforcing injections. -8- FOOD POISONING. Four cases were notified. All were fully investigated but only one was confirmed bacteriologically when the causative organism was found to be salmonella typhi-murium. In no instance was the source of infection traced. PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE DISTRICT. The general arrangement of the health services for the District continues the same as in previous years. The Middlesex County Council is the Local Health Authority for the purposes of the National Health Service Act and provides the services relating to the care of expectant and nursing mothers and young children, the domiciliary midwifery service, the home nursing service, the arrangements for vaccination and immunisation, the ambulance service, and the domestic help service. The County has been divided into ten areas each with an Area Health Committee acting as a sub-Committee of the County Health Committee. The District forms part of Area No. 2 which also includes the Districts of Southgate, Wood Green and Potters Bar. The Council is represented on this Area Health Committee by Councillors A.C. Henry and J. Foley. For hospital services the District is within the area administered by the North-West Regional Hospital Board. Laboratory services are provided by the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, and the Laboratory, Coppetts Wood Hospital, Coppetts Road, N.10. Both these laboratories are directed by the Medical Research Council for the Ministry of Health. The advice and assistance of the Laboratory Service is available at all times in investigating and controlling outbreaks of infectious disease or foodpoisoning. Fortunately the need for such special aid did not arise during the year, but the routine examination of specimens has been, as always, of very great help. The Public Health Department is a collecting centre for specimens, which are called for daily, and the following were sent for examination during the year:- -9- Throat or Nose 63 Faeces 48 Sputum 1 Pertussis 3 Ice Cream 58 Milk 23 Miscellaneous 3 SANITARY SERVICES. The public health services provided by the Council include such matters as housing, food inspection and hygiene, the sanitary conditions in factories and shops, rodent control, the investigation and control of infectious disease, sewerage and sewage disposal and the collection and disposal of refuse, all functions essential to the maintenant of a healthy environment. SUMMARY OF INSPECTIONS. Visits to premises on complaint 485 Visits in connection with infectious disease 152 Visits to shops and places where food is prepared, stored or sold 424 Visits to other shops 219 Visits to factories 120 Visits to petroleum installations 72 Visits in connection with housing and the repair of dwelling-houses 1606 Appointments and special visits 393 Visits re infestation and disinfestation 64 Visits in connection with rodent control 1419 Visits to piggeries 18 Visits re Pet Animals Act 7 Visits re Rag Flock Act 4 SERVICE OF NOTICES. Number of informal notices served 272 Number of informal notices complied with 205 Number of statutory notices served 39 Number of statutory notices complied with 31 -10- INSPECTION AND REPAIR OF HOUSES. Activities to secure the repair of dwellings and the remedy of particular defects continue to account for a substantial amount of the Department's efforts. Inspections are made either as a routine in the investigation of housing conditions, following complaints by occupiers, or as a result of statements made by applicants for housing accommodation. The volume of work in this direction has not diminished, whilst considerations, mainly financial, have made it necessary to five more time and effort to individual properties in order to secure essential repairs which are often delayed longer than we would wish. Many of the accumulated defects of the war and immediate post-war years have now been made good, but there remains a core of properties which presents a continuous problem and in which one type of defect is no sooner remedied than another is revealed. The practice usually followed in dealing with unsatisfactory houses is to indicate in the form of an Intimation Notice the particular repairs required and where possible a meeting is arranged with the owner or agent at the premises when the conditions can be demonstrated and discussed and the method and extent of repair agreed. In most instances the repairs were carried out as a result of this informal action and in comparatively few instances was it necessary to serve Statutory Notices under the Housing or Public Health Acts. In no case was it necessary to proceed with legal action to enforce compliance with a Notice, but at the end of the year an Appeal under the Housing Act to the Court, in respect of a requirement for the carrying out of repairs, was outstanding.

Inspections of the various premises wherein food, is prepared, stored or sold were made during the year to see that the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act relating to food premises and the Byelaws relating to the handling of food were being observed. These Byelaws came into operation in the District on the 3rd. July 1950, and copies have been supplied to all food establishments and to all traders distributing food in the District. It was not necessary to recommend -12- the taking of legal proceedings for any contravention of the Byelaws. In a number of instances repairs, improvements or redecorations to premises were considered necessary and these requirements were referred to the occupiers. In general there was a readiness to co-operate with the Department and these matters were dealt with without reference to formal action. The opportunity was taken whenever possible in the course of these visits to food premises to talk with foodhandlers on various aspects of food hygiene and these informal discussions on matters concerning the safe handling of food must surely have beneficial results. The Public Health Committee gave consideration during the year as to what steps might be taken to further stimulate interest in this subject and after a questionaire addressed to the food traders bad indicated good support for the formation of a Clean Food Guild the Council decided to sponsor the establishment of such an organisation in the District. At the time of writing a Steering Committee composed of Members of the Council and of representatives of the Traders has been appointed to consider the several issues involved. FOOD INSPECTION. There are no slaughterhouses in the District. Five pigs however were slaughtered during the year - two under the self-suppliers scheme of the Ministry of Food, and three in emergency. The carcases of two of the pigs slaughtered in emergency were totally condemned. Of the foodstuffs examined at the various shops and other stores throughout the District the following were condemned as unfit for human consumption:— Beef 868 lbs. Lamb 58 lbs. Pork 6 lbs. Chickens/Turkeys 138 lbs. Whalemeat 104 lbs. Fish 210 lbs. Flour 176 lbs. Sugar 127 lbs. Biscuits 36 lbs. Sweets 5 lbs. Cooking fat 14 lbs. Suet 6 lbs. -13- Tinned Meat/Ham/Veal 127 tins. „ Vegetables 140 tins. „ Milk 96 tins. „ Fish 21 tins. „ Apricot Pulp 4 tins. „ Baby Food 55 tins. „ Fruit 267 tins. „ Fruit Juice 11 tins. „ Soup 20 tins. „ Sausages 11 tins. „ Jam/Marmalad 4 tins. Cheeses 74 packets. Pudding/Sponge Mixtures 96 packets. Blancmange 14 packets. Cereals 13 packets. Dates 1 packet. Jam 7 jars. Pickles 10 jars. Fruit 4 bottles. Lime Cordial 1 bottle. FOOD HAWKERS. Persons selling food from a vehicle, cart, barrow etc., are subject to the same provisions relating to the safeguarding of food supplies as are all other food traders. In addition the Middlesex County Council Act requires that they shall be, registered by the Local Authority who may refuse to do so if the public health is or is likely to be endangered by any act or default of the person in relation to the quality, storage or distribution of the food or if the storage premises, are unsuitable. There has been little change in the position during the year. One further application, for the sale of fruit and vegetables, was approved, and the total number of registration at the end of the year was:- Persons. Premises. Fruit and Vegetables. 11 8 Fish 3 — Groceries 1 – -14- ICE CREAM. There are 49 premises throughout the District registered for the sale of ice-cream. No new registrations were granted during the year. Inspections of these premises were made to see that the requirements of the Food and Drugs Act and the Ice-Cream(Heat Treatment &c) Regulations were observed. Where ice-cream was sold from vehicles these were examined as to suitability. Generally the standards were good and called for little comment. Routine sampling of the ice-cream for bacteriological examination was continued and the results were again most satisfactory. Specimens were placed into one of four grades following a test as to their bacterial cleanliness. Grades 1 and 2 are considered to indicate a satisfactory condition and Grades 3 and 4 unsatisfactory. The 58 samples taken were placed in the following grades:- Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 Grade 4 54 4 Nil Nil MILK SUPPLY. The milk supplied throughout the District is either pasteurised, sterilised or tuberculin-tested. Twenty-three samples were taken during the year, all of which were satisfactory. Three incidents were investigated where milk was supplied in unclean bottles. The results of the enquiries suggested that in each case the bottles had been misused to contain substances other than milk, and had thereafter evaded the system of inspection at the bottle-washing depots where such bottles are usually taken out of use and destroyed. No complaints were received concerning the quality of the milk supplied. There were 19 companies or persons registered as distributors of milk within the District, and one dairy engaged in the pasteurising and bottling of milk. -15- The following licences were granted:– Dealer's Licence. Supplementary Licence. To sell Pasteurised Milk 3 8 To sell Sterilised Milk. 12 8 To sell Tuberculin-Tested Milk 4 9 WATER SUPPLY. The water supply of the District is provided by the Barnet District Water Company. The supply has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity, and there is no evidence of any plumbo-solvent action. All the houses in the District have a piped supply. The few complaints received concerning the supply were found to be due to domestic storage cisterns in need of cleansing or covering. Bacteriological and chemical examinations of the water were carried out at regular intervals in the Company Laboratory and by an independent Laboratory, and copies of the reports on samples were received in the Department. The following is typical of the reports received:- "This is a very satisfactory sample. It is clear and bright in appearance and of the highest standard of bacterial purity consistent with a wholesome water suitable for public supply purposes." PESTS AND VERMIN. The process of survey and treatment for the elimination of rats was continued during the year and 442 premises were examined. Of these 165 were found to be infested in varying degree and treatments were carried out by one or other of the methods recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. In a few instances the infestations were associated with defects in the drainage system, but to a greater extent there was a connection with the keeping of fowls. The Sewage Works, Depots, Parks and other open spaces were -16- regularly inspected and treatments were carried out where and when necessary. In addition to these attacks against the rat population on the surface, two treatments of the sewers were carried out in the months of August and December. The number of manholes shewing signs of use by rats was 29 and 20 respectively. When these treatments were first started in 1947, 55 manholes were found to be infested. As a result of these various activities it is estimated that some 1900 rats were destroyed. A further 42 premises were treated where there were infestations by mice. A total of 1374 visits were made by the rodent operative in connection with these operations. It was not necessary to take any legal proceedings under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 1949 in order to free premises or land or to secure such structural repairs as were found necessary. The reduction in the number of premises found to be in a verminous state previously noted has continued and only five dwellings were shewn to be infested by bed-bugs. All were sucessfully treated. There was an increase in the number of wasp nests in respect of which assistance was sought and thirty-one were destroyed. We first started to deal with these nests where they were in situations causing concern to users of the public footways, but subsequently our help was asked to destroy nests in a variety of locations. We will continue to give what aid we can but our resources are sometimes strained particularly where the nests are situated in the eaves or roof spaces of houses. Innumerable requests for advice and assistance were dealt with in connection with other infestations, particularly by ants, furniture beetles or moths, and to a lesser extent the many types of insects which infest foodstuffs or invade the home. One Colorado beetle found in an imported lettuce was brought to the Department as were many other insects and beetles thought to be Colorado beetles. -17- FACTORIES. The Council adminsters certain of the provisions of the Factories Act 1937, mainly relating to health. These provisions deal with cleanliness, overcrowding, temperature, ventilation, drainage of floors, and sanitary conveniences. In factories where no mechanical power is used the Council enforces all these provisions, but where mechanical power is used the Council's responsibility is limited to securing the provision of adequate sanitary conveniences, the remainder being enforced by H.M. Inspectors of Factories, who also deal with the many other provisions of the Act relating to safety and welfare. The Council also has the duty of ensuring that certain classes of factory are provided with satisfactory means of escape in case of fire and of issuing certificates to that effect. Three such certificates were issued during the year. There are 75 factories of various types and sizes in the District. The Act requires occupiers of factories to forward to the Council, twice yearly, a list of persons employed by them in outwork on specified classes of work, and the information enables control to be exercised over work carrier out in unsatisfactory premises or in conditions likely to lead to the spread of infection. Notification was received of 64 outworkers, who were engaged in the following occupations:- Wearing apparel 57 Box making 2 Brush making 2 Feather sorting 2 Making of lampshades 1 In no instance was it necessary to restrict outwork on account of infectious disease. -18- RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT 1951. This Act is designed to secure the use of clean filling materials in the manufacture of bedding, toys, baby carriages and articles of upholstery. There is one premise registered where the filling of upholstery is carried on. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948. Section 47. Removal to suitable premises of persons in need of care and attention. No formal action was taken under this Section whereby the Council are enabled to secure the removal to suitable accommodation of persons who being aged, infirm, or suffering from chronic disease are living in insanitary conditions and who are unable to devote to themselves and are not receiving from other persons proper care and attention. Section 50. Burial or Cremation of the dead. No action was necessary under this section by which it is the duty of the Council to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who has died or been found dead and where it appears that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have been made. -19- TABLE 1.
