THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. OLAVE DISTRICT. ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Sanitary Condition of the District, FOR THE YEAR 1894, BY WILLIAM ARTHUR BOND, M.A., M.D., D.P.H. (Camb.), M.R.C.P. (Lond.) Medical Officer of Health LONDON: PRINTED BY C. TALBOT, 101 TOOLEY STREET, SOUTHWARK, S.E. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Being the Report for the Year 1894. To the Members of the Board of Works for the St. Olave District, Southwark. Gentlemen, I have the honour to place before you my first Annual Report, being the Report for the year 1894, in accordance with the regulations of the Local Government Board. VITAL STATISTICS. I have based the calculations in the following Reports upon the population of all ages, as usually estimated to the middle of the year 1894. This is 12,974. The number of inhabited houses in April, 1891—according to the census return—was 2,083, an increase of 36 per cent. in ten years; and the average number of persons to a house was 6.1. BIRTHS. The number of births registered for the whole District (which includes the three Sub-Districts of St. Olave, St. John and St. Thomas), for the 52 weeks ending Dec. 29th, 1894, was 431. Of this total, 215 were male children and 216 female children. This gives a birth-rate of 33.2 per thousand 4 of the population. The birth-rates for the four preceding years were 32, 36.2, 37.8 and 30.3. The birth-rate for London for the year was 30.1. DEATHS. The deaths registered as having actually occurred in the District were 7.8; 564 of these took place at Guy's Hospital, this number including only 17 deaths of parishioners, 547 belonging to other districts. At the Parish-street Workhouse there were 34 deaths, only 5 of these belonging to the District. Fourteen bodies were found in the Thames, only one of which was that of a parishioner. The deaths of 53 parishioners were returned from outlying public institutions. After making the necessary corrections, it is found that 252 deaths of parishioners took place in the 52 weeks ending December 29th, 1894. The annual death-rate was, therefore, 19.4 per thousand. The death-rate for London for the year was 17.7. The corrected death-rates of St. Olave's, and of London for the past five years are as under— Year. St. Olave's Death-Rate per 1,000. London Death-Rate per 1,000. 1890 20.2 21.5 1891 25.2 21.4 1892 23.7 20.4 1893 21.2 21.3 1894 19.4 17.7 1 he detailed causes of death will be found on turning: to the various tables accompanying this Report. 5 Infantile Mortality.—The deaths of young children always bear a High ratio to total deaths. There were 106deaths of children under 5 years old, that is 421 of per cent. of the total deaths. The equivalent percentage for London was 40 .7. 56 children died under one year old; that is, 130 per 1,000 births registered. The corresponding rate for London was 143 per thousand. Zymotic Diseases. The death-rate in St. Olave's from "the seven principal Zymotic diseases," viz., Small-Pox, Scarlatina, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, Measles, Whooping-Cough and Diarrhoea, was 2.7 per thousand persons living, the same rate as for London as a whole. Small-Pox.-There was no case of Small-Pox notified, and no death. In London, there were 1391 notifications, and 93 deaths. Scarlet Fever or Scarlatina.—There were 33 cases notified, and two deaths. Two of the children attacked with Scarlet Fever also contracted Measles about the same time, and died from the lung complications of the latter; 31 of the 33 cases were treated in hospital. In London, the notifications were 18,950 in number, and the deaths from the complications of this disease were 964. Diphtheria.—28 cases were notified, and all were removed to hospital, except some of the Guy's Hospital cases, which were treated there. There were 4 deaths. In London there were 11,120 cases notified, and 2,673 deaths from this disease, being 952 less than in 1893. Enteric Fever—Six cases were notified, only two belonging to the District. The others were nurses who had been 6 nursing Typhoid patients. There was no death from this disease. In London there were 3,541 notifications of this disease, and 635 deaths. Measles.—This disease is not notified. There were as many as 19 deaths from this disease. This is generally regarded as a very harmless disease by the lower classes, and a doctor often is not in attendance till the patient is moribund. In London there were 3,292 deaths from this disease, which caused the greatest mortality of all the Zymotic diseases, being 23 per cent, more than that of Diphtheria, which was the next highest. Whooping-Cough also is not notified. In this District there were seven deaths from this cause. In London there were 2,094 deaths from this disease. Diarrhœa.—This also is not generally notified. Many deaths registered as "Gastro-Enteritis" would probably by some medical practitioners be certified as Diarrhoea, and vice versa. In this District there were three deaths from Diarrhoea, and seven from Gastro-Enteritis. The deaths in London from Diarrhoea were 1,780. The total number of notifications of Infectious Diseases this year have been only 83, excluding second notifications of the same cases. They were distributed among the following diseases:— Scarlet Feverb 33 Diphtheria 28 Typhoid Fever 6 Erysipelas 16 83 7 Excluding the cases of Erysipelas, for which no provision is made in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, all but two of the cases were treated at these Hospitals, or at Guy's. This fact, and the little difficulty that is now experienced in getting patients removed to isolation hospitals, speak highly of the tact and energy of your Sanitary Inspector, and of the excellent management of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and of the increasing appreciation of these Hospitals by all classes. Most of the cases of infectious disease belonging to outlying Districts that are first taken to Guy's Hospital, and afterwards removed to the Fever Hospitals, or treated at Guy's Hospital, are now notified to the Medical Officer of Health of the districts in which the patients reside. Only three of the cases of Scarlet Fever notified from Guy's Hospital belonged to other districts. Seven of the cases of Diphtheria, and two of the cases of Typhoid, were among the nursing staff of Guy's Hospital; also one case of Diphtheria and two of Typhoid, were nurses of Guy's Nursing Institution, and the diseases were contracted in their duties out of the District. The great value of compulsory notification, prompt removal to isolation hospitals, cleansing of infected rooms, and the efficient disinfection of bedding and other infected articles, has been very markedly shewn this year. Last year, there were as many as 219 notifications and, as just mentioned, this year there were only 83, a reduction of more than 62 per cent. This District this year has had rather less than two-thirds the amount of notifiable disease than the rest of London for an equivalent population. 8 I congratulate the Board on the acquisition of its own steam disinfector, erected at Guy's Hospital, which was in good working order on March 30th. The measures taken in dealing with the cases arising in the District outside Guy's Hospital were as follows:— Number of rooms fumigated 65 Number of rooms stripped and cleansed by Owner or Occupier 57 Number of notices served, calling the attention of Occupiers of houses to the provisions of Sections 62 and 65 P. H. (London) Act, 1891 43 Number of notices requiring disinfection 24 Number of articles of bedding, clothing, &c., disinfected since March 30th, when the new disinfector was first used 1010 Bedding given up and destroyed 2 Number of persons using Shelter 72 The premises where infectious diseases occurred were all inspected and examined, and notices served when necessary. The Shelter provided for temporary occupation by families during the disinfection of their rooms, has been used 17 times during the year, by 72 persons in all, 65 of whom were also provided with sleeping accommodation. There were two deaths at Guy's Hospital from Anthrax, or Mali gnant Pustule, contracted in this District from handling hides infected with the disease. Some suspicious hides were found by Dr Wightwick, at a Wharf at which one of the men was employed, and 210 China goatskins were removed and destroyed. 9 Diseases of the Respiratory Organs. In this District there were 33 deaths caused by Phthisis, or 2.5 per 1 000 inhabitants; 33 by Pneumonia, and 15 by Bronchitis. Inquests were held in 123 cases in this District; only 18, however, were on the bodies of parishioners. Mortuary. 33 bodies were removed to the Mortuary in Weaver's-lane. I may be permitted to remind the Board that the accommodation at the Mortuary is inadequate, and that there is no satisfactory provision for the holding of inquests. These matters are now being considered by your Works and Finance Committee, and several reports thereon have been furnished by your Surveyor and myself. Temperature. The mean temperature of the year was 50°.2 F., being 1°.2 above the average of the preceding ten years. 10 BAKEHOUSES. The Bakehouses of the District have been inspected by Dr. Wightwick and myself. The worst of them has since my inspection been closed. In most of them the Board's regulations have been complied with. Notices were served on the Occupiers of those in which sanitary defects were found. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT. Five houses in Queen's-court, and four in Gibbon's-rents, were found to be in such an insanitary state as to justify proceedings under this Act. Closing orders were in each case obtained, and duly carried out. At Queen's-court the houses have been demolished; at Gibbon's-rents the houses are closed, but not yet demolished. SANITARY WORK. Nuisances. In Table V. (Sanitary) at the end of the report, prepared by your Sanitary Inspector, Mr. Ashdown, will be found a detailed list of nuisances and other insanitary conditions reported upon and work done during the year. This has all been satisfactorily carried out under the supervision of you careful and conscientious Inspector, and drains thoroughly tested by the water test before being covered in, 11 Collection of House Refuse. This important service continues to be carried out regularly and efficiently, as not a single complaint of neglect or inattention has been made here during the year. On the contrary, 121 visits have been made to houses where the dustmen have reported failure to obtain the refuse at the appointed times; and in 14 cases where the Occupiers have refused the dustmen's request to permit the removals, notices have been served, but no further proceedings were necessary. 25 new sanitary dust-pails have been provided. These much facilitate the work of the dustmen. Foods unfit for Human Consumption. The undermentioned were given up by the respective Owners, and destroyed, the same being found unfit for the food of man:— Tons. cwts. qrs. Plums (3 lots) 6 18 3 Oranges 2 10 0 Pears (2 lots) 3 16 3 Potatoes 2 10 0 Onions 4 2 Salmon 1 0 0 Eggs 19 2 Tinned Meat 1 1 Green Peas (from Australia), 8 cases—about 8 0 Asparagus ( „ ), 1 case „ 1 0 18 9 3 Only one seizure of food has been made where a prosecution followed. As the case is one of special interest to a 12 district of this description, where large quantities of food of almost every description are landed, and the Magistrate's decision renders the Act to a great extent inoperative, I venture to briefly repeat the facts— About 3 tons 3 cwts. of plums—all of which were unfit for the food of man, and were subsequently condemned and ordered to be destroyed— were delivered from a Wharf in the District to a van standing in the public street, with a view to their removal into another district. The seizure took place at this point At the hearing of the case, the owner's representative admitted that he had seen samples of the goods previous to the removal of the plums from the Wharf. He, however, stated, and produced witnesses to prove, that the goods were only being removed for examination, and not for sale. Sale oe Food and Drugs and Margarine Acts. A summary of the samples that have been taken and submitted to the Public Analyst, and the proceedings taken, will be found in Table VI. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. A. BOND.
