HAM 12. Hammersmith 1910. Annual Report OF THE Medical Officer of Health OF THE BOROUGH OF HAMMERSMITH For the Year 1910. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH OF THE BOROUGH OF HAMMERSMITH For the Year 1910. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Hammersmith. April 26th, 1911. Gentlemen—I beg to present to you my Annual Report for last year. The Report will deal with the vital statistics, and with the Sanitary work carried out under the direction of your Council during the 52 weeks ending on 31st December, 1910. The statistical tables prescribed by the Local Government Board are added, as well as the several other tables that directly or indirectly relate to the Public Health of the Borough. The deaths of non-Residents have been deducted, and the deaths of Residents occurring in other parts of London have been added as heretofore. Deaths of persons occurring in institutions receiving sick and infirm persons, have alone been regarded for the purpose of correction. This is in accordance with the 4 direction of the Local Government Board, some of the figures consequently materially differ from the figures in the published return of the Registrar-General, who is not restricted to the same prescribed forms. BIRTHS. During last year 2,910 births, 1,499 males, 1,411 females, were registered in this Borough against 2,887 in the previous year. Making due allowance for the increase of the population, the number of births registered last year was 374 below the average number registered during the previous 10 years. On the population estimated up to the middle of the year, i e., 127,413 inhabitants, the number of births registered was equal to an annual rate of 22.8 births per 1,000 persons living. The birth rate in London on the estimated population of London up to the middle of the year, i.e., 4,872,702 inhabitants, was equal to an annual rate of 23.6 births per 1,000 persons living. These figures are calculated upon the actual number of births registered in the Borough and in London. No distribution of the births of children whose parents lately resided elsewhere has been made. The RegistrarGeneral has corrected the births by allotting them to the districts to which the mothers were said to belong. He gives the corrected births of Hammersmith as 3,045. I have no data at my disposal for so correcting the births in this Borough. DEATHS. During last year 1,569 deaths were registered in this Borough, 828 males, 741 females, against 1,778 in the previous year. Making due allowance for the increase of the population, the number of deaths registered in the Borough last year was 170 below the average number registered during the previous 10 years. 5 Adding 209 deaths of residents of this Borough, which took place in general hospitals and other public institutions in other Boroughs of London, in London County Lunatic Asylums and Metropolitan Imbecile Asylums, and deducting 240 deaths of non-residents which occurred, 195 at the West London Hospital, 26 at Nazareth House, 18 at the Hammersmith Infirmary, and 1 at St. John's Hospital, Uxbridge Road, the corrected number of deaths of residents registered last year was 1,538. On the before-mentioned estimated population, the corrected number of deaths of residents registered last year was equal to an annual rate of 12.1 deaths per 1,000 persons living. The death rate in London on the estimated population of London up to the middle of the year was equal to an annual rate of 13.4 deaths per 1,000 persons living. DEATHS OF INFANTS. The corrected number of deaths of residents under one year of age registered last year was 304, against 361 in the previous year. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age registered last year was equal to 198 per 1,000 of the total deaths of residents registered, and to 104 per 1,000 of the total registered births. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age, residents in London last year, was equal to 191 per 1,000 of the total deaths registered, and 103 per 1,000 of the total registered births. The mortality rate of infants under one year of age was, as compared with the total deaths of residents registered, 7 per 1,000, and, as compared with the total births registered, 1 per 1,000 greater in this Borough than in London. The following table on infantile mortality has been prepared by me in accordance with the direction of the Local Government Board. 6 LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD RETURN.—TABLE V.

The corrected number of deaths of residents at 60 years of age and upwards that were registered during last year was 509, males 245, females 264, against 589 in the previous year. These deaths last year were equal to 4.0 per 1,000 of total persons living, and 331 per 1,000 of the total deaths of residents registered. The corrected deaths registered of persons at 60 years of age and upwards belonging to London last year was equal to 4.3 per 1,000 of the total persons living, and 336 per 1,000 of the total deaths of London residents registered. This death rate was, therefore, .3 less in this Borough than in London as compared with the total persons living, and 5 per 1,000 less in this Borough than in London as compared with the total deaths registered. 9 local government board return.—table 1.

Block i may, if desired, be used for the whole district ; and blocks 2, 3, &c., for the several localities. In small districts without recognised divisions of known population this Table need not be filled up. (b) Deaths of residents occurring in public institutions beyond the district are to be included in sub-columns c of this Table, and those of residents registered in public institutions in the district excluded. (See note on Table I. as to meaning of terms "resident" and "nonresident.") (c) Deaths of residents occurring in public institutions whether within or without the district, are to be allotted to the respective localities according to the addresses of the deceased. (d) Care should be taken that the gross totals of the several columns in this Table respectively equal the corresponding totals for the whole districts in Tables I. and IV.: thus, the totals of sub-columns a, b, and c should agree with the figures for the year in the columns 2, 3, and 12, respectively, of Table I.: the gross total of the sub-columns c should agree with the total of column 2 in Table IV., and the gross total of sub-columns d with the total of column 3 in Table IV. 12 Corrected Death-rates of Metropolitan Boroughs after Distribution of Deaths in Public Institutions, &c., as calculated by the Registrar-General for year 1910.

AND V. (а) In Table IV., all deaths of " Residents" occurring in public institutions whether within or without the district, are to be included with the other deaths in the columns for the several age groups (columns 2.8). They are also, in columns 9.11, to be included among the deaths in their respective "Localities" according to the previous addresses of the deceased as given by the Registrars. Deaths of "Non-residents" occurring in public institutions in the district are in like manner to be excluded from columns 2.8 and 9.11 of Table IV. (б) See notes on Table I. as to the meaning of " Residents " and " residents," and as to the "Public Institutions" to be taken into account for the purposes of these Tables. The "Localities "in Table IV. should be the same as those in Tables II. and III. (c) All deaths occurring in public institutions situated within the district, whether of "Residents" or of "Non-residents," are, in addition to being dealt with as in note (a), to be entered in the last column of Table IV. The total number in this column should equal the figures for the year in column 9, Table I. (d) The total deaths in the several "Localities" in columns 9.11 of Table IV. should equal those for the year in the same localities in Table II., sub-columns c. The total deaths at all ages in column 2 of Table IV. should equal the gross total of columns 9-11, and the figures for the year in column 12 of Table I. (e) Under the heading of "Diarrhœa" are to be included deaths, registered as due to Epidemic Diarrhœa, Epidemic Enteritis, Infective Enteritis, Zymotic Enteritis, Summer Diarrhœa, Dysentery and Dysenteric Diarrhœa, Choleraic Diarrhœa, Cholera (other than Asiatic or epidemic), and Cholera Nostras. Deaths from diarrhœa secondary to some other well-defined disease should be included under the latter. Deaths from Enteritis, Muco-Enteritis, Gastro-Enteritis, and Gastritis (see under the heading Diarrhœal Diseases in Table V.) in Tables IV. and V. should be placed immediately below, but separately from, those enumerated under the heading Diarrhœa as defined by enumeration above. This is particularly important for deaths under one year of age, as many of the deaths in infancy returned as due to Enteritis are really caused by Epidemic Diarrhœa. In the course of years, by the adoption of this recommendation, it will be practicable to ascertain the probable amount of transfer between these different headings. (f) Under the headings of "Cancer" and "Puerperal Fever" should be included all registered deaths from causes comprised within these general terms. Thus: Under "Cancer" should be included deaths from Cancer, Carcinoma. Malignant Disease, Scirrhus, Epithelioma, Sarcoma, Villous Tumour and Papilloma of Bladder, Rodent Ulcer. Under "Puerperal Fever" are to be included deaths from Pyaemia, Septicaemia, Sapræmia, Pelvic Peritonitis, Peri- and Endo-Metritis occurring in the Puerperium. 15 (g) Under "Congenital Defects " in Table V. are to be included deaths from Atelectasis, Icterus Neonatorum, Navel Haemorrhage, Malformations and Congenital Hydrocephalus. (h) Under "Tuberculous Meningitis" are to be included deaths from Acute Hydrocephalus. (i) Under "Other Tuberculous Diseases" are to be included deaths from Tuberculosis, Tuberculosis of bones, joints and other organs, Lupus and Scrofula. (f) All deaths certified by registered Medical Practitioners and all inquest cases are to be classed as "Certified"; all other deaths are to be regarded as " Uncertified." In recording the facts under the various headings of Tables I., II., III., IV. and V., attention has been given to the notes on the Tables. N. C. COLLIER, Medical Officer of Health. 16 DEATHS FROM THE NINE PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The total number of deaths of Residents that were registered from the nine principal zymotic diseases was 165 against 205 in the previous year. The deaths of Residents last year from these diseases were equal to 107 per 1,000 of the total deaths of Residents registered, and were at the rate of 1.3 deaths per 1,000 persons living. The deaths from the nine principal zymotic diseases in the whole of London were equal to 90 per 1,000 of the total deaths registered, and were at the rate of 11 deaths per 1,000 persons living. These deaths were, therefore, as compared with the total deaths of Residents registered, 17 greater per 1,000 deaths belonging to this Borough than in London, and, as compared with the population, .2 per 1,000 greater in this Borough than in London. The following table shows the deaths of Residents registered from the nine principal zymotic diseases which occurred in the 10 years 1901 to 1910:— YEAR. Small-pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. Whooping Cough. Typhus Fever. Enteric Fever. Simple continued Fever. Diarrhœa and Cholera.

CASES OF ILLNESS REPORTED AS DUE TO INFECTIOUS DISEASE. There were, omitting phthisis, 609 cases reported as due to notifiable infectious diseases in this Borough against 675 in the previous year. The number of cases of phthisis notified was 163, against 199 in the previous year. There were also reported 912 cases of infectious diseases that were not notifiable, against 1,268 in the previous year ; 228 of these were chickenpox, 484 measles, and 200 whooping cough. SMALL-POX. No case of small-pox was notified in the Borough last year, against no case in the previous year. CHICKEN-POX. Two hundred and twenty-eight cases of chickenpox were reported, against 140 cases in the previous year. The 228 cases reported last year were treated at the homes of the patients. No death was registered. MEASLES. Four hundred and eighty-four cases were reported as due to measles, against 847 cases in the previous year. Sixty-seven deaths were registered. As this is not a notifiable disease it is of no use my giving the mortality rate on the cases reported, as no doubt only a proportion of the cases which occurred were 18 known of by me. Owing to the stringent instructions of the Educational Department of the London County Council most of the cases, as usual, occurring among pupils at the schools of the London County Council were reported to me. A strict system of disinfection was carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and very little opposition was met with. The disinfection in the case of measles has entailed a large amount of extra work on the Public Health Department, and particularly so on the Disinfectors. From the whole of the notifiable infectious diseases there were only 42 deaths, whereas from measles alone there were 67 deaths. In every case that was reported the premises were at once inspected as to the sanitary condition. SCARLET FEVER. Three hundred and forty cases were notified as due to scarlet fever, against 380 in the previous year. Two hundred and ninety-nine cases reported last year were isolated at Isolation Hospitals, and 41 cases were treated at the homes of the patients. Six deaths were registered. The mortality rate on the cases reported was only 18 per cent. DIPHTHERIA AND DIPHTHERITIC MEMBRANOUS CROUP. One hundred and sixty-one cases were reported as due to diphtheria or diphtheritic membranous croup, against 188 cases in the previous year. One hundred and forty-four cases reported last year were treated at the Isolation Hospitals, and 17 at the homes of the patients. Twenty-five deaths were registered. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 15.5 per cent. A communication was received from the Local Government Board, dated August 15th, with the order 19 of the Board of the same date, on the question of the gratuitous provision of diphtheria antitoxin and for the application of the same under your authority. I attended a Conference called by the Society of Medical Officers of Health to consider the question. A resolution was passed that the early use of the antitoxin was desirable, and I reported the result of the Conference's deliberation to your Public Health Committee. Your Committee decided that, having regard to the fact that most cases of diphtheria are immediately removed to hospitals, and that medical practitioners could easily obtain a local supply of antitoxin, it was not necessary for your Council to supply it. WHOOPING COUGH. Two hundred cases were reported as due to whooping cough, against 281 cases in the previous year. All of the cases reported last year were treated at the homes of the patients. Twenty-six deaths were registered. As this is not a notifiable disease it is of no use my giving the mortality rate on the cases reported, as doubtless a very large number of cases occurred which were not known of in the Public Health Department. I have continued to receive as heretofore information as to cases from the Head Teachers of the Schools of the London County Council. ENTERIC FEVER. Thirty-one cases were reported as due to enteric fever, against 17 in the previous year. Twenty-two of the cases reported last year were treated at the Isolation Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, four at the West London Hospital, one at the Hammersmith Infirmary, and four at the homes of the patients. Four deaths were registered. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 12.9 per cent. 20 TYPHUS FEVER. No case was reported as due to typhus fever, against no case in the previous year. SIMPLE CONTINUED FEVER. One case was reported as due to simple continued fever, against no case in the previous year. The case reported last year was removed to the Western Fever Hospital. No death was registered. RELAPSING FEVER. No case was reported as due to relapsing fever, against no case in the previous year. PUERPERAL FEVER. Nine cases were reported as due to puerperal fever, against 14 cases in the previous year. Four of the cases reported last year were treated at the homes of the patients, 3 at the West London Hospital, and 2 of the cases were treated at the Hammersmith Infirmary. Four deaths were registered. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 44.4 per cent. CHOLERA. No case was reported as due to cholera, against no case in the previous year. ERYSIPELAS. Sixty-three cases were reported last year as due to erysipelas, against 75 cases in the previous year. 21 Fifty cases were treated at the homes of the patients, 4 at the Hammersmith Infirmary, and 9 at the West London Hospital. Three deaths were registered. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 4.8 per cent. PLAGUE. No case was reported as due to plague, against no case in the previous year. CEREBROSPINAL FEVER. Two cases were reported as due to cerebro-spinal fever, against one case in the previous year. The 2 cases reported last year were treated : 1 at the West London Hospital and 1 at the Hammersmith Infirmary. Both of the patients were non-parishioners. Two deaths was registered, the mortality rate being 100 per cent. GLANDERS. One case was reported as due to glanders, against no case in the previous year. The case reported last year was removed to the West London Hospital and recovered. ANTHRAX. One case was reported as due to anthrax, against no case in the previous year. The case reported last year was removed to the West London Hospital and recovered. HYDROPHOBIA. No case was reported as due to hydrophobia last year, against no case in the previous year. 22 TABULAR STATEMENT ZYMOTIC DISEASES.

Fourteen deaths were registered as due to influenza, against 37 deaths in the previous year. No official action was taken in reference to this complaint, as no application was made for the disinfection of any of the houses in which death occurred. PHTHISIS. The voluntary notification of phthisis, which your Council decided upon on 7th April, 1902, was continued during last year. Altogether, 163 cases were notified to me against 199 cases in the previous year. These, no doubt, represent only a small proportion of the cases that actually occurred, as 135 deaths were registered, against 139 deaths in the previous year. In all cases notified or in which death occurred, the premises were at once inspected, and after death in all cases occurring in private dwelling houses an offer was made to disinfect the premises at the expense of your Council. In every case a printed instruction as to the course that should be adopted for the prevention of consumption was left at the premises. In very few instances was advantage taken of the offer of your Council to disinfect. Of the 163 cases notified last year, 123 were reported under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908, from Infirmaries, Workhouses, and District Poor Law Medical Officers. Only 8 were reported by private Medical Practitioners, 30 by the Medical Superintendent of Brompton Hospital, 1 by the Medical Superintendent of St. Margaret's Hospital, 1 from the Royal Victoria Hospital, Netley. LICENSED SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The whole of the licensed slaughter houses in the Borough were under inspection by the Inspector for offensive trades. At the annual inspection of slaughter houses in October, 1910, I had received 29 notices that 9 licences were to be applied for. All of them were found to be, as far as your Council's requirements were concerned, in a satisfactory condition. Your Council decided to inform the London County Council that you offered no opposition to the renewal of any of the licences, and at the Special Sessions at the London County Council, held in October, the 9 licences were granted.

The 61 bakehouses now in use as bakeries in the Borough were under a regular half-yearly inspection by the Factory Inspector. One hundred and three defects were discovered upon the premises during the year. Notices were at once served upon the bakers calling upon them to comply with the regulations of your Council. In every case the notice was complied with. It was not decided to apply for any summonses against bakers whose bakehouses were found not to be in conformity with the Act, as they readily complied with the requirements of your Council when called upon by notice to do so.

During the year 11 applications were received for certificates under these Acts. There was a very considerable amount of work which had to be carried out in reference to these applications. In no case was the certificate granted until the whole of the sanitary requirements were carried out so as to place the premises in a proper sanitary condition. I decided to refuse certificates in all cases in which gas stoves were used which were not provided with a hood and ventilated so as to carry off the products of combustion. The following is a list of premises which were inspected, under the Inland Revenue Acts, last year:— Name and Situation of Property. No. of Houses and blocks for which applications were received.

Eighty-six Intimation Notices were served in reference to defects found to exist in certain of the above premises, and thirty-five Notices were complied with. 38 The following is a list of the premises certified by me during the year:— i, 3, 4, and 5, The Lodge, Sinclair Mansions. 182, The Grove. 8, 27, 28, 30, and 43, Sinclair Road. SEIZURE OF UNWHOLESOME FOOD. During last year no seizure was made of food which was unsound, unwholesome and unfit for the food of man. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. During the last year the Public Health Committee gave directions for the registration of 368 " houses let in lodgings or occupied by the members of more than one family," making a total with those previously ordered to be registered of 4,647 premises. Upon the registration a copy of the Bye-laws of your Council, under which such houses are registered, was forwarded to the landlord (within the meaning of the Bye-laws) for his guidance. From various causes 1,046 houses have been removed from the list, leaving a total number now on the Register of 3,601. During the year 455 notices were served and 443 were complied with. The registered premises were visited as often as time would allow by the special Inspectors appointed for that purpose. SANITARY NOTICES AND ADMINISTRATION. During last year 2,336 notices were reported as having been served by your four District Sanitary Inspectors having for their object the removal or prevention of nuisances or insanitary conditions, against 2,314 in the previous year, and during last year 2,143 notices were reported as having been complied with, against 2,215 in the previous year. 39 The House-to-House inspection has been continued during the year. This Inspector reports that during the year he has inspected 2,999 houses and other premises in the borough, against 3,054 houses in the previous year. As a result of his inspection, defects were discovered in 1,041 houses, and 1,041 Intimation Notices were served by the House-to-House Inspector. These cases were subsequently dealt with by the four District Inspectors. Three hundred and fifty-five houses coming under the provisions of the Bye-laws as to "Houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family," were discovered by this Inspector, and were subsequently dealt with by the Inspector in charge of the work under the Bye-laws. The Health Visitor reports to me that she has made 2,522 visits with regard to the care of infants, and has advised parents as to the methods of feeding, clothing, etc. She also reports to me that she discovered 89 premises on which insanitary conditions existed. SANITATION OF THE JAPANBRITISH EXHIBITION. The Sanitation of the Japan-British Exhibition had, as in the previous year, the most careful consideration of your Public Health Committee both as to the efficiency and sufficiency of the sanitary accommodation provided. Owing to the sparseness of attendance at the Exhibition the amount of sanitary accommodation was greatly in excess of the requirements. 40 INSPECTION OF FACTORIES, Etc. Your factory inspector has during the year served 295 notices under the Factory and Workshop Act, and during the same period 283 notices have been complied with. During the previous year there were 257 notices served and 244 complied with. The following is a list of the Factories and Workshops upon the Register:— Restaurants, Hotels, &c. 158 Bakehouses (5 not used at present as Bakeries) 66 Bootmakers 73 Motor and Cycle Makers and Engineers 51 Dressmakers and Milliners 252 Laundries 305 Letterpress Printers and Bookbinders 29 Electrical and Mechanical Engineers 53 Smiths, Wheelwrights and Coachbuilders 36 Tailors 54 Bottle Washing Works 15 Dry Cleaning, Dyeing, and Carpet Beating Works 18 Firewood Cutters 15 Builders and Joiners (Machine) 31 Outworkers. 579 Miscellaneous 116 1,851 The whole of these premises have been under a systematic inspection by your special Inspector appointed for that purpose, and numerous improvements in the sanitary condition of these premises have been carried out under his supervision. In addition to this work Mr. Neighbour performed for a considerable part of the year the duties of Smoke Inspector. 41 TABLE I.

A footnote should be added to show that this has been done. † The figures required in columns 2. 3, and 4 are the total number of lists (received from employers who sent them both in February and August as required by the Act) and of the entries of names of outworkers in those lists. They will, therefore, usually be double of the number of such employers and (approximately) double of the number of individual outworkers whose names are given, since in the February and August lists of the same employer the same outworker's name will often be repeated. 44 4.—REGISTERED WORKSHOPS.

If the Annual Report is presented other than in print, it is unnecessary to include in the copy sent to the Home Office the portions which do not relate to factories, workshops, laundries, workplaces, or homework. The duties of Local Authorities and the Medical Officer of Health under the Act of 1901 are detailed in the Home Office Memorandum of December, 1904. A further Memorandum on the Home Work Provisions of the Factory Act was issued to all Borough Councils and Medical Officers of Health in October, 1906. 45 ICE CREAM DEALERS. The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902, which came into operation on the 1st November, 1902, by Part VIII., made provision for the regulation, manufacturer, and sale of ice cream or other similar commodities. The duty of obtaining the necessary information for the registration of premises upon which ice creams are made was carried out up to June by Sanitary Inspector Gee and by Sanitary Inspector S. Huggons Brown for the remainder of the year. At the present time there are 224 premises upon the register and 5 notices have been served, all of which have been complied with. The following is a table in reference to the above-named premises. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS, AND MILKSHOPS ORDER, &c. PROCEEDINGS DURING 1910. PREMISES. NUMBER OF PLACES. Number of inspections, 1910.

The regulations under the above Order appertaining to the stoppage of sale of milk, disinfection, and the granting of certificates were strictly enforced under my directions. There were 48 applications made during the year for registration of premises for sale of milk, and after inspection certificates were granted. In no case was a milkshop taken off the Register on the grounds that the premises were unsuitable. SUMMONSES ORDERED. During last year your Council and the Public Health Committee gave authority for 35 summonses to be taken out against persons for having failed to comply with the requirements of notices which had been served. In most cases before summonses were issued a letter was written to the person in default, informing him that the Public Health Committee had recommended the summons, and asking him if he was willing to give an undertaking in writing that he would forthwith comply with the notice which had been served. In most cases the undertaking was at once given, and it was not found to be necessary to apply for the summons. It has been the object of the department, as heretofore, to take out as few summonses as possible, but at the same time in no instance to allow anyone to defy the authority of your Council. During last year five summonses were taken out through the Public Health Department. 47 SUMMONSES HEARD. situation of premises. nature of offence. result of proceedings. Eynham Brickfields, Wood Lane Deposit of offensive refuse on land. Dismissed. The learned magistrate dismissed the summons on the same ground upon which I advised the Public Health Committee that the By-law would not apply. 184, Goldhawk Road Non-compliance with sanitary notice.

PUBLIC MORTUARY. During last year 223 bodies were removed to the mortuary at Fulham Palace Road. There were 116 bodies brought to the mortuary by order of the Coroner or the Police ; 58 bodies were taken from the West London Hospital, and 49 bodies were received for accommodation.

During last year I had occasion to bring before your Public Health Committee complaints in reference to the following alleged Public Nuisances in the Borough :— Eynham Brickfields, Wood Lane. Mr. J. Latter. Deposit of refuse and keeping of pigs. Excel Meat Co., Hammersmith Road. The whole of these complaints had the careful consideration of your Public Health Committee. 48 SMOKE ABATEMENT.

Regulations ok Local Government Board. The Local Government Board made an order dated 2nd September, 1910, under Section 17 of the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909. In accordance with your Public Health Committee's instructions, I presented the following report:— "With regard to the regulation of the Local Government Board dated 2nd September, 1910, made under Section 17 of the Housing and Town Planning Act, &c., 1909, I beg to state that, owing to the automatic system of house-to-house inspection which has been made by the Sanitary Authority of this Borough for many years, there is 110 class of property in this Borough in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unlit for human habitation, but in order to comply as far as possible with Article 2 of the said regulation, I have selected the subjoined list of streets in this Borough which, in my opinion, it would be advantageous to have inspected more often than can be done by the automatic system of house-to-house inspection adopted, that is to say, thev are the streets in the district which, in my opinion, are most prone to become in an insanitary condition. I beg therefore to submit the following list and advise that a house-to-house inspection be made of them at the commencement of each year under my supervision by Inspector Cosson, having regard to Article 2, Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. " I beg to advise that under Article 3 a special register be kept detailing the sanitary requirements as specified in the article, and that the book be presented to your Public Health Committee at each meeting. District No. 1. Trafalgar Street Aspen Place Bridge Street Felgate MewOrris Mews District No. 2. Grove Mews Barb Mews Rayleigh Road Brook Green Place District No. 3. Priory Mews Coleman Bldgs. Lycett Place Melina Road Leffern Road District No. 4. Hunt Street Southbrook Street Latimer Mews" Your Council adopted the report and a special book for the registration of the premises has been prepared, to be placed before your Public Health Committee at each meeting. 50 METEOROLOGY. The average mean temperature registered in London during last year was 50-2° Fahrenheit. The highest temperature registered was 82° in June. The lowest temperature was 20° in January. Rain fell on 185 days. The total amount of rainfall was 28 06 inches. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, N. C. COLLIER, l.r.c.p., l.s.a. Medical Officer of Health.
