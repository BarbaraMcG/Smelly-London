Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you for your consideration a report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough for 1962. The report follows the similar pattern of previous years which enables easy reference and comparison. The sections give you a guide to the varied work carried out by your Public Health Department. Of special interest was the opening of the Municipal Club extension by the Mayor, Cllr. Mrs. Coyle. This extension provided much needed space for the ever increasing membership and activities of our 'young' old people. Several groups of youths from Bermondsey clubs, some Guy's Hospital students, pupils from Aylwin Girls School and Bede House students commenced visiting the lonely aged in their homes. They visit in pairs during the evenings and week-ends and, as well as having a friendly chat with the old person, they make themselves useful where necessary. This is much to be encouraged and it is a good supplement to all our other services especially the week-end meals on wheels service which caters for the frail and ill housebound lonely old people who would otherwise have no visitors over the week-end periods. The part played by the mid-week meals service, the incontinent laundry service, home help service etc., and a whole host of wonderful work by the voluntary bodies does much to ease their lot. The dread of smallpox was before us during this year and, like most other Public Health Departments, numerous visits, investigations and vaccinations were carried out to exclude the possibilities of infection being brought into the area and spreading. As promised in the last year's annual report the complete article on staphylococcal food poisoning due to cheese is now included in this report. May I extend my thanks to members of the Council and to my Public Health Committee for their support and encouragement during the year, also to all members of the staff for their help and support. I am, Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. E. EPSOM. VITAL STATISTICS. AREA The area of the borough (exclusive of area covered by water) is 1,336 acres.

She was admitted to hospital and, in the meantime, her home was cleared of the rubbish, cleaned and disinfected. Her bedding was replaced and her home generally made wholesome again ready for her return from hospital. (b) A Public Health Assistant visited a flat in response to a telephone message from a Home Help who had reported that she had been unable to attract the attention of the occupier. Entry to the flat was made and the occupier, an elderly lady, was found sitting on the floor of the living room, having had a fall at 11 p.m. the previous night. She appeared to have a fractured femur which was later confirmed upon her admittance to hospital. The lady made a good recovery from her ordeal. These are only two instances of the work carried out which without any doubt has been a great comfort to numerous elderly people and has saved many of them from unnecessary worry and suffering. The bathing service provided in the Council's Cleansing Station and the domiciliary bathing service both continue to expand. The Council continue to act as agents for the Council for the Welfare of Old People in operating the Meals on Wheels service and the meals service for the Municipal Club. With the agreement of the Chairman of the Council for the Welfare of Old People the cost of each meal was increased in August from 2/- to 2/3d. and the charge to old people increased from 1/- to 1/1d. The following table sets out the number of meals supplied during the year: Meals on Wheels Municipal Club January 2,358 918 February 2,097 815 2,475 1,001 March April 2,226 806 May 2,664 1,035 June 2,327 818 2,442 927 July August 2,331 1,003 September 2,133 854 October 2,569 1,015 2,715 1,041 November December 2,359 714 28,696 10,947 The extension to the Meals on Wheels Service introduced in 1961 to cater for the needs of handicapped and homebound persons unable to provide themselves with a meal on Saturday and Sunday has proved its worth. This service started with 2 persons being catered for and by the end of the year, 15 persons were being supplied with meals each week-end. The Council, acting as agents for the Red Cross, loaned 39 articles of home nursing equipment to sick persons during the year. The Women's Voluntary Service supplied clothing to a number of old people on the recommendation of the Medical Officer of Health. MUNICIPAL CLUB In this, the fifth year of the Club's existence, the enrolled membership totalled 537. The programme of entertainments is arranged to suit the varied interests of the members. It includes Whist Drives, Old Time Dancing, darts, and Arts and Crafts classes. It is hoped that more accommodation will become available in the near future and this would allow for the provision of a television room and a reading room. On 20th June the members of the Club and Workrooms held their Annual Outing. This year they went to Margate and were accompanied by the Mayor and Mayoress and other members of the Council. During the year, parties of members visited theatres to see such shows as "South Pacific", "See How They Run", and the "Black and White Minstrel Show". Other outings included visits to Madame Tussauds and the Huntley & Palmer's factory at Reading. Members also took a trip to Southend-on-Sea to see the illuminations. All these outings were eagerly awaited and, because of the demand, some members were unable to be included in the parties. The Club, in continuing its links with the Women's Institutes Organisation, visited institutes at Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, and Hadlow, nr. Tonbridge. These visits are always thoroughly enjoyed by the members who take great pleasure in returning the hospitality shown them. On two occasions during the year the Flour Advisory Bureau were good enough to send lecturers to the Municipal Club to demonstrate the proper use of protein food. The annual "Bring and Buy" sale was held in December and the money raised helped to meet the expenses of the Annual Party which is planned early in the New Year. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 Section 47 Under Section 47 of the Act the Council has authority, where necessary, to make application to a magistrate for the emergency removal to hospital, or institution, of an aged, infirm, or physically incapacitated, person who is living in insanitary conditions and is "una ble to devote to himself, and is not receiving from other persons proper care and attention." Under the provisions of the National Assistance (Amendment) Act. 1951, a magistrate may also order the emergency removal of such persons to a hospital or institution for a period not exceeding twenty one days, on certification by the Medical Officer of Health and a general medical practitioner. Fortunately, it is only in exceptional cases that compulsory action is taken and then when all persuasive efforts have been fruitless and it is found to be essential in a patient's own interests. During the year under report the Council made application for committal orders in respect of three old persons who could not care for themselves adequately and who had refused hospital treatment although this was considered by their private doctors to be needed. Details are given below. The Misses E. & R. G., aged 72 and 80, had been visited regularly since May 1957 and latterly a marked deterioration in their health and living conditions had been observed. They became unco-operative and refused the offers of assistance made to them. Their case was discussed with their private doctor and he agreed that they were in need of proper care and attention. In view of their refusal to accept hospital treatment or to enter a home for the elderly it was considered there was no alternative but to apply for committal orders. When the orders were being effected, Miss E. G. was found lying helpless at the foot of the stairs, having suffered a leg injury, and on her admission to hospital it was found that she had sustained a fractured neck of the femur. Her sister, who did not need hospital treatment, was admitted to a home for the elderly for the statutory twenty-one days, and at the expiry of this period she agreed to reside there permanently. Miss M. J. H., age 75, occupied basement rooms in a house due for demolition. She had been visited on several occasions by the Public Health Assistant but had refused all welfare services. In view of her obvious poor state of health her private doctor was asked to see her and he agreed that she needed hospital treatment; this, however, she refused to have. Her doctor was consulted again, following a second visit when he found that her condition had deteriorated considerably, and it was considered that compulsory action was the only course to be taken. Subsequently, she agreed to enter hospital for treatment, but changed her mind on the arrival of the ambulance. Application was therefore made for a committal order and the patient was admitted to hospital where her condition proved to be such that she died the following morning. During the course of the year, four old people agreed voluntarily to be admitted to hospital or homes for the elderly, and the necessary arrangements were made. INSPECTIONS, PROCEEDINGS, ETC.

In order to obtain a punctual examination and rapid decision, the importers paid for a considerable number of samples to be examined. These results, like all others, were submitted for my approval in the first instance. The method of sampling was by batch numbers (signifying packing dates and factories). Where a sample showed evidence of contamination the whole batch was placed under detention and later either re-exported or released for pasteurisation and high temperature baking. The main importations were of frozen whole egg from Australia, South Africa and China and laboratory results showed the following percentage of contaminated samples in each case:— Australia 5.85% South Africa 5.21% China 13.15% The total number of samples from all egg products found to be contaminated was 182 and the following table shows the type of contamination:— No. of samples Salmonella aberdeen 2 Salmonella anatum 3 Salmonella bareilly 2 Salmonella derby 1 Salmonella dublin 1 Salmonella enteritidis 1 Salmonella hessarek 1 Salmonella jerusalem 1 Salmonella meleagridis 5 Salmonella mission var. isangi 1 Salmonella montevideo 21 Salmonella newport 2 Salmonella norwich 1 Salmonella oranienburg 2 Salmonella paratyphi B 4 Salmonella potsdam 5 Salmonella pretoria 1 Salmonella st.

Cheese consumed with meals came under suspicion and the remaining bulk from the hospital stores (about 180 lbs) was transferred to the importers' premises in Tooley Street, Bermondsey, where samples were taken for bacteriological examination. Of these initial seven samples the average count showed approximately 200 million coagulase-positive staphylococci per gram of cheese. The cheese in question was designated New Zealand 2nd grade and all crates and cardboard containers were clearly marked "For manufacturing purposes only". In fact, the producers never intended it to be sent direct for marketing but for processing only, which would include dilution with other cheese and heat treatment. The fact that this cheese escaped to hospitals led to prosecution of the City firm concerned, as vendor, by the Corporation of London. The firm pleaded guilty and fines were imposed. The discovery of such large numbers of coagulase-positive staphylococci in a usually reliable and safe food of this kind was unexpected and initiated one of the most interesting investigations. For full appreciation a brief description of the general situation relating to cheese is necessary. Each year about 200,000 tons of cheese are eaten in Great Britain (or about 10 lbs. per head per annum on average); 96,000 tons were imported through Bermondsey in 1961. New Zealand exports to the U.K. between 90,000 and 100,000 tons annually and, of this, under 1% is 2nd grade cheese and amounts to between 700 and 800 tons. 2nd grade cheese is so called because, when classified by New Zealand exporters, it may have neither the taste, body, colour, nor texture of normal cheese. The cause of the above faults of taste etc. is commonly the suppression of the starter culture. This in turn is due either to bacteriophage or antibiotic action. Normally, a starter culture, lactic acid forming streptococci, is added to milk and commences the changes which lead to the formation of curd. However, occasionally the starter culture is slow to grow or does not grow at all, no acid is formed and other organisms such as coagulasepositive staphylococci may grow profusely; the cheese produced may be classified as second grade. This second grade cheese has been imported into the United Kingdom for many years for processing and has not, so far as is known, caused any trouble after processing. Cheese processors have been keen to buy this 2nd grade cheese owing to its lower cost, and use between 10% and 25% of it for mixing with other ordinary cheese and certain salts. The temperature reached in processing, while high enough to destroy vegetative cells of bacteria, would not destroy staphylococcal enterotoxin. The remainder of the stored cheese was examined and, because of the bacteriological results, approximately 130 tons of 2nd grade New Zealand Cheddar cheese were placed under detention in the warehouses in Tooley Street pending further examination. Since coagulase-positive staphylococci do not all produce enterotoxin there is difficulty in saying whether cheese contaminated with these organisms is capable of producing food poisoning; nevertheless a heavy contamination with any coagulase-positive staphylococci must be regarded as potentially dangerous. The problem is complicated by the fact that there is no practicable routine method of detecting enterotoxin, and also that boiling for 30 minutes, for example, reduces but does not necessarily destroy enterotoxin 1 . Coagulase-positive staphylococci belonging to phage group IV, type 42D, were predominant in the cheese causing the outbreaks and this type is well known as a cause of food poisoning from bovine products. 2 Other strains with different phage patterns were also present in the cheese. It has been suggested that the lowest count of coagulase-positive staphylococci in foods responsible for food poisoning is approximately 500,000 to 1,000,000 per gram. 3 . 4 . Hence, sampling on a large scale was continued but, in order to keep the cheese processing factory working, cheese was released with staphylococcal counts of up to 2,000,000 per gram according to the percentages in the appendix. These brands were tasted without any effect on the individuals concerned. The term "Tasting" here and henceforward refers to the actual consumption of between one and two ounces of cheese per person, the approximate amount which would be eaten with a meal. The reaction of the person subject to enterotoxin is variable, but tasting was the only method which could be applied in the present circumstances. Although the bacteriological tests revealed that enormous numbers of coagulase-positive staphylococci were present in this cheese there was no way to identify the strains as those capable of producing enterotoxin except by inference from the results of phage typing. 4 Even so the phage types were not always clearly indicative of those known hitherto to produce enterotoxin. Therefore a detailed plan was devised whereby special processed mixes were made of cheese from various brands with staphylococcal counts of 9,000,000 to 60,000,000 per gram as set out in tasting procedures in the appendix. The plan was carried into effect in strictly hygienic surroundings in a special part of the processing factory and with separate utensils. The firm concerned was most conscientious and anxious to co-operate. There was an acute shortage of this commodity at the time. Gradually, starting with 10% of the lowest count cheese (5,000,000 per gram plate count), working through 20%, 50% and, finally, 100% no symptoms were produced by approximately twenty tasters per test. Cheese was tasted containing up to a 60.000,000 per gram 1 Jordan E. 0., Dack S.M., Woodpont O. 1931. Journal of Preventive Medicine, Vol. V. Surgalla M. J. and Hite K. E. 1945.

Proceedings Royal Society of Medicine 1949, Vol. 42, page 216. count of staphylococci without trouble. The success of volunteer experiments will depend on the number of volunteers, the amount of cheese eaten, the susceptibility of each volunteer and, of course, the number and types of coagulase-positive staphylococci in the cheese which in turn will govern the amount of enterotoxin in the cheese. It was considered that tasting was not worth while unless at least 15 to 20 persons per test took part. It was reported by Dr. B. C. Hobbs, Central Public Health Laboratory, and D. W. H. H. Merivale, Guy's Hospital, that strains of coagulase-positive staphylococci isolated from various samples of cheese were penicillin resistant. Professor R. Knox, Guy's Hospital, was unable to find traces of penicillin by microbiological assay in samples of the cheese of high and low staphylococcal counts; this was expected since penicillinase produced by the resistant staphylococci would have destroyed free penicillin. Phosphatase tests on the cheese were carried out but, they could not be relied upon to show that pasteurisation of the milk was effective or not. The verbal statements of some of the exporters indicated that only sub-pasteurisation temperatures of milk had been reached It has been widely, but mistakenly, held that good cheese cannot be made from pasteurised milk. 5 Normally, the acidity of the cheese prevents the development of staphylococci which may be present in variable numbers in milk. When insufficient acid is formed by a slow starter culture the staphylococci are able to grow in the curd and persist in the cheese. This may be due to bacteriophage action in the starter culture, but the presence of penicillin resistant staphylococci in such large numbers in cheese, nine to twelve months following production, strongly suggested that penicillin was the inhibitory factor in the milk, from the widespread use of penicillin by the New Zealand farmers in an attempt to control mastitis in their herds. The method used was to express a tube of penicillin ointment into the affected udder via the teat. Some penicillin would come down with the milk eventually together with varying numbers of penicillin resistant staphylococci. Coagulasepositive staphylococci are commonly found in raw milk. Quantities of bulked milk destined for cheese making, therefore, may have had variable amounts of penicillin and staphylococci present. Starter cultures, when added to this milk, would be killed by the penicillin and hence acidity would not develop, and the resistant staphylococci would multiply profusely in the curd and during maturation. On 12th May 1961 the first meeting of the London riparian medical officers was held with the trade representatives to discuss these new problems with cheese. It was considered that further information was required on the extent of the contamination and it was suggested that intensive sampling by batches should be carried out. Although desirable, it was not practicable since the bacteriologists could not have examined the thousands of cheese samples which this would have entailed. It was, therefore, decided to carry 5 Davis J. G. Dictionary of Dairying. out 100% sampling of three large batches and, as will be seen from the appendix, the results revealed the extent of the contamination. The second meeting of riparian medical officers, held on 12th July 1961, was called at my request and this time I insisted that a Ministry of Health representative be present. The results of all the tests as listed in the appendix were presented by me and the question of the disposal of 130 tons of cheese was discussed. I strongly resisted a proposal that all this cheese should be released for processing at 5% dilution. Following considerable further discussion it was move by the Ministry of Health representative that cheese with counts between 200,000,000 and 600,000,000 should be considered as unfit for human consumption but that cheese with counts of up to 200,000,000 should be released for dilution to 5% in processing. This was a level which it was suggested should produce a safety margin by dilution. In any processed cheese thus diluted there would be in the heaviest contaminated cheese the possibility of toxin from a count of 10.000,000 (5% of 200,000.000). Already a variety of brands of cheese had been tasted with counts up to 60,000,000 without ill effect; although the heat treatment of processing would kill the staphylococci but would not affect the toxins; it was held, however, that the 5 % dilution would lower the level of toxin to a safe degree. Preventive Measures Obviously, this soultion could not be regarded as desirable for the future, and it was essential to ensure that future supplies of cheese, either Ist or 2nd grade, were as free from coagulase-positive staphylococci as possible. The New Zealanders, following our advice that milk for cheese making should be fully pasteurised, rapidly introduced legislation for its compulsory effective pasteurisation (161°F for 15 secs.). Also all crates and boxes of 2nd grade cheese were to be marked "For Processing Only" and directed to cheese processing factories only. Further, bacteriological sampling of cheese would be carried out in New Zealand to cover the production and marketing of the cheese. A provisional standard was introduced for future consignments of 2nd grade cheese, namely 500,000 coagulase-positive staphylococci per gram, beyond which importation would not be allowed. Results The bacteriological examination of 2nd grade cheese produced after the introduction of the new regulations in New Zealand showed an immense improvement with very low counts or absence of coagulase-positive staphylococci. Comment (i) 2nd grade cheese, from whatever source, can be a dangerous commodity. It should only be released for processing (heat treatment and dilution); and then only if made from pasteurised milk. The production, development and storage should be covered by bacteriological sampling. (ii) Tasting 2nd grade cheese is not a pleasant occupation and was only justified in this instance to further our knowledge and to ascertain if possible the level at which symtoms of poisoning would take place in the potentially dangerous brands. (iii) It is paradoxical that a country like New Zealand, with world famed high quality dairy products and with the highest standards of hygiene, should be faced with a problem which presumably arose through a vigorous attack on staphylococcal mastitis in cows by the use of penicillin. (iv) This is a further warning against the widespread and indiscriminate use of antibiotics. In the first instance I must acknowledge the very great help and advice given by Dr. Betty Hobbs throughout;and also that given by Dr. H. H. Merivale, Professor R. Knox, Dr. J. Ross and Dr. M. T. Parker.

TASTING PROCEDURES 4 brands were processed at the cheese factory as follows:— OAONUI 9,000,000 per gm. BELL BLOCK 25,000,000 per gm. FLAX 40,000,000 per gm. TRIDENT 60,000,000 per gm. Each brand was processed in 4 lots in proportions of 10%, 20%, 50%, and 100 %. A quantity of cheese (BELL BLOCK) was sent to Dr. J. Ross of the Ministry of Health for tasting purposes. Dr. Ross reports that 22 people tasted the cheese and were at risk. All tests proved negative. The OAONUI, FLAX and TRIDENT processed cheeses were tasted in the Public Health Department; 18 people were at risk but all tests proved negative. IMPORTED FROZEN PRAWNS Consignments of Frozen Prawns and Shrimps from various countries continued to enter the borough during 1962. A total of 541 samples was taken. Samples from eight consignments showed bacteriological plate counts per gram at 37 °C in excess of 2,000,000, and two samples disclosed the presence of Salmonella typhi-murium. All these consignments were detained. Where a consignment showed a plate count of between 250,000 and 2,000,000 the importer was warned that the prawns must be used immediately after defrosting.
