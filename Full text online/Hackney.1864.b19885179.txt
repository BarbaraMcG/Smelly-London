Gentlemen, I have during this year, in company with Mr. Valentine, inspected a very large number of houses within your District, and in accordance with the rule adopted of late, I append a list of the localities and of the number of houses inspected. Many of these inspections were made in consequence of an outbreak of epidemic diseases, others in the course of my inspections of the poorer localities, and the rest in consequence of complaints received. 4 Street or Road.

They were generally, in a better state of substantial repair than at former visits, but 11 required to be cleansed and whitewashed, 86 repaired as to paving, and 8 required new traps. The number of Births registered within the Hackney District increases every year: in 1860, they were 2663; in 1861, 2752: in 1862, 2768; in 1863, 3075; in 1864, 3170. The Births in 1864 were more than 500 above the number registered in 1860, and more than 400 above that of 1861. 7 TABLE 1. 1864.—Births in each Sub-District. Quarters. Stoke Newington.

By this we see that the smallest birth-rate in 1864 corresponded with the smallest population in 1861, and the largest birth-rate with the largest population. Also that out of each 1000 births registered for the whole District, 46 took place in Stamford Hill sub-district, 58 in Stoke Newington, 252 in West Hackney, 248 in South Hackney, and 396 in Hackney sub-districts; that the largest number of births were registered in the third, and the smallest in the second quarter The total number of births registered in the District was 3170, of which 185 were registered in Stoke Newington, 146 in Stamford Hill, 800 in West Hackney, 1253 in Hackney, and 786 in South Hackney. The next table to which I wish to refer, is one showing the birth-rate for each Sub-District, since 1856: 8 TABLE II. 1857-64.—Birth-Hate in each sub-district. Years. Stoke Newington.

In 1857, out of each 1000 births in the whole district, 68 were registered in Stoke Newington, 62 in Stamford Hill, 322 in West Hackney, 378 in Hackney, and 170 in South Hackney. Out of each 1000 in 1861, there were 62 in Stoke Newington, 46 in Stamford Hill, 298 in West Hackney, 397 in Hackney, and 185 in South . Hackney. In comparing these numbers with those of 1864, we see that the reduction of the rate as regards Stamford Hill, Stoke Newington, and West Hackney still continues, whilst the increase in Hackney, and especially in South Hackney, still progresses. On referring to Table 4, we find that this arises from increase of population, rather than to any alteration in the social condition of the inhabitants, for the Death-rate has fallen in Stoke Newington, Stamford Hill, and West Hackney, sub-districts, and risen in Hackney and South Hackney, 9 TABLE III. 1864.—Death in each Sub-District.

This increase, although large, was not so great as for the whole of London, as the year 1864 was the most fatal one for many years past. There were 3170 births in the District against the 2142 deaths, so that the increase arising from the excess of births was more than 1000. The annual rate of increase of population in the District has been about 4 per cent. and as the excess of births accounts for only a little more than 1 per cent., the remainder must be placed to the account of immigration into the District from other localities. This great increase has raised the population from 50,000 (calculated) in 1857, to 68,000 in 1856, to 83,295 at the census in 1861, and to a calculated number of 97,000 at the present time. The rental of the Parish of Hackney has also increased enormously, shewing a corresponding addition in the number of houses In 1851, the rental was £211,000, in 1861, the rental was £302,000, whilst in 1856, when the Metropolis 10 Local Management Act was introduced, the rental was £253,000 and the population calculated at 68,000; and in 1864, the rental £358,000 and the population above 94,000. The number of deaths registered in Stoke Newington Sub-District was 143, in Stamford Hill 104, in West Hackney 483, in Hackney 991, and in South Hackney 423. These figures however do not show the number of deaths which belong to each Sub- District, as the German Hospital, the East London Union, and the Hackney Workhouse, are situated within the Hackney SubDistrict. To ascertain the proper numbers, we must deduct the deaths which occurred in the German Hospital and East London Union Workhouse, and spread the mortality in the Hackney Union pro rata over the other Sub-Districts. In this way, by eliminating the 220 deaths which were registered in this Hospital and East London Union Workhouse, from the grand total, and distributing the 20 deaths which occurred in the Hackney Workhouse, we arrive at the following corrected numbers, viz.: 148 for Stoke Newington, 109 for Stamford Hill, 508 for West Hackney, 718 for Hackney, and 439 for South Hackney; these numbers will be seen by Table 4 to have varied in almost a corresponding ratio with the births since 1856, the rate of both having been most uniform in Hackney, and varied most in South Hackney, since that year.

By this table we ascertain that although the deaths were considerably greater than those in 1863, (having indeed been more than 200 in excess), yet the mortality from epidemic diseases, was 34 below those for that year, and with the exception of the extremely healthy year 1860, was the smallest pro rata since 1856. This is very satisfactory indeed, because it is this particular class of diseasse 12 which has proved so fatal in London generally, and also because the Table proves that the increased mortality was not caused by want of care in the sanitary department. Excluding 1860, we ascertain that during the years 1857-61, the mortality from epidemic diseases has varied between 19.8 and 23.7 per cent. of all the deaths. The total number of deaths from zymotic (epidemic) diseases, was 423; from tubercular diseases, 367; from diseases of the nervous system, 239; from affections of the heart, 121, and of the lungs, 409. This was by far the largest mortality from lung diseases which has been registered, as the proportion of deaths from these affections have varied between 13.9 and 19.1 per cent, the latter being the rate for 1864. The number, 147, from old age, was about an average, indeed, the deaths registered under this head vary less than in any other class, as the lowest rate registered during 1857-64 was 6.2, and the highest 7.2 per cent. There were also registered 17 deaths from intemperance or privation, one man having died from attempting to drink a pint of raw brandy at a draught.

The disease which has varied most is small-pox, which was very fatal in the year 1863, and less so, this year. Small-pox is a disease, like scarlet fever, and other eruptive fevers, which produces a very varying rate of death in different years. It certainly would not prove so fatal as in the years 1863-64, if vaccination were efficiently performed, but we cannot expect that vaccination, however carefully done, will extirpate the disease, because a certain proportion of persons suffer from it a second time. Measles was unusually fatal, no less than 79 deaths having been registered from it, which is more than double the average number. Scarlatina on the other hand, was much less fatal than usual, and we may expect it to be so for the next two years, and then be unusually prevalent during 1867-68; and measles proportionately to decline. Diphtheria obeys the same laws as scarlatina, and many therefore are classed with it. Whooping-cough was unusually prevalent, and produced a high rate of mortality. There was however, an excess of mortality from the diseases grouped together as fever, compared with last year, but the deaths were not so numerous as in 1862. I should have excluded a considerable number of cases from this head, but as I had included all doubtful cases at first, I retained them, for the sake of comparison. It is much to be regretted that so many deaths are returned as caused by fever, which ought evidently be registered under a different class. I may mention that on enquiry I found many deaths from child-birth had been registered as fever. The total number of deaths caused by these seven diseases was no less than 366 in 1864. The deaths registered in each quarter of the year was more uniform in number than in the year 1863. There were 604 recorded during the first quarter, 466 in the second, 489 in the third, and 583 in the last quarter. The proportions in 14 each 1000 deaths for the whole year were, 282 in the first quarter, 218 in the second, 228 in the third, aud 272 in the fourth. These proportious, as may be seen in Table VII., do not differ materially from those of former years, except in 1863, as the largest mortality occurred in the fourth, and the lowest in the second quarter.

The ages at death were as follows: 477, or at the rate of 223 in each 1000 deaths at all ages; 351, or 164 per 1000 above 1 year and under 5 years; 108, or 51 per 1000 above 5 and under 15 years; 128 above 15 and under 25, or 60 per 1000; 150, or 70 per 4000 between 25 and 35 years old; 154, or 72 per 1000 between 35 and 45 years; 164, or 77 per 1000 between 45 and 55 years old; 148, or 69 per 1000 between 55 and 65 years old: 239, or 111 per 1000 between 65 and 75 years; 168, or 78 per 1000 between 75 and 85; 52, or 24 per 1000 of persons who died between 85 and 35 years old; and 3, or 15 more than 1 per 1000 who reached the extreme old age of 95 years and above. We ascertain from this statement that no less than 103 per 1000 reached the great age of 75 years and upwards before death. The mortality for the whole of London during the year, was enormously high. The Registrar-General in his summary for the year, observes that "in January, cold or other unfavorable atmospheric causes, raised the deaths to what may be termed, not unjustly, a plague rate of mortality, for in the second week of the year, they were 2427, and in the third week 2180, and in thirteen other weeks, chiefly at the beginning or towards the end of the year, they were above 1600, on two nights in the first week of January, the thermometer fell as low as 14° or 15°. The lowest number of deaths was returned in the twenty-second week, when it was 1213."—"The rate of mortality was 2.645 per cent. The average in twenty-five years, which include two periods of epidemic cholera, was 2.432 per cent. The deathrate was not so high as it was last year, in any of the preceding twenty-four years, except 1847, the influenza year, when it was 2.695 per cent., and 1849 and 1854, the two cholera years, when it rose to above 3 per cent." In the Central and East Districts, the mortality was 2.9 per cent., in the West, North, and South Districts, the death-rate was about 2.5 per cent. But the first of these groups (the West) was the healthiest, perhaps, because the people who live in it may enjoy on the whole the amplest provision of food, fuel, clothing, and houseshelter against inclement seasons. In the Northern Districts, the mortality-rate was about 2.53 per cent.; and for Hackney, after eliminating the deaths in the East London Union and German Hospital, 1 in each 49 residents, or 2.08 per cent. If we add the proportion of 16 deaths in public institutions, the rate becomes elevated to 2.24 per cent., which although in excess of that for 1863, when it was 2.12 per cent., is much below that of the Northern Districts generally, and very considerably below that for the whole of London. The mortality for the Northern Districts in 1863, was 2.37 against 2.53 in 1864, so that the increase for Hackney is less than that for the adjacent districts. The great increase in the number of houses has led to a corresponding increase in the duties of the sanitary department. The number of Nuisances abated have been considerably in excess of those in many previous years. Mr. Valentine has also had a great deal more trouble than usual in consequence of the obstinacy of many owners of property. His work has been so regularly and zealously performed, that only eight summonses at the Police Court, were necessary to obtain the removal of so large a number of nuisances. The returns of nuisances do not always show the amount of work done, as in the years 1856, 1857, and 1858, notices were served on the owners of whole streets at once, and there was consequently less labour incurred in obtaining the removal of 100 nuisances than often now obtains in the removal of 10. There is no doubt that the ordinary water-closet is not suited to the poorest classes, as in consequence of their careless and dirty habits, and want of control over their children, the water-closets become blocked up repeatedly and very often broken. The total number, 1410, of nuisances abated during 1864, are included under the following headings: Privies emptied, filled up. and drained into the sewer 169 Privies and cesspools emptied 18 Stable, Pig, Cow-dung, and other refuse removed 185 Premises repaired and whitewashed 211 Galleys trapped, Roads cleansed, &c 23 17 Pigs removed, and Pigsties repaired and cleansed 60 Choked Drains cleansed, repaired, and re-constructed 411 Urinals, and other filthy and offensive places cleansed 56 Other Nuisances 277 Total 1410 This table shows the great alteration which has occurred in the character of the nuisances during the last five years. Thus there were 1224 nuisances removed during the year 1859, of which 447 were cases requiring the cesspools to be emptied, filled up, and drained into the sewer, whilst in 1864, there were only 169 cesspools filled up. On the other hand, in 1859 there were only 138 instances of choked drains which required cleansing and repairing or reconstructing, against 411 in 1864, In 1859 there were only 85 filthy houses cleansed and repaired against 211 in 1864. This table therefore incontestably shows that as new houses are erected and new drainage works made, nuisances which require the intervention of the Board will also increase instead of diminish. There were 75 owners of property summoned before the Board for neglecting to comply with the requirements of the preliminary notices, out of which number 67 removed the nuisances without any legal proceedings being taken. The last table which I shall submit to you, is one showing the causes of all the deaths in the district during 1864, under 12 different ages. This is a very important table as it forms the basis of many of the calculations. TABLE OF DEATHS REGISTERED IN TIIE HACKNEY DISTRICT, DURING THE YEAR 1864.
