Davies (Resigned 28.12.62). 4 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Erith Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1962 which has been prepared on the lines set out in Circular 1/62 of the Ministry of Health. The Registrar General's estimate of the mid-year population is 45,300 (45,050 in 1961). The vital statistics supplied annually by the General Register Office indicate that the general trend of the health of the Borough remained satisfactory. The standardised death rate, which allows of comparisons with other areas, was 11.82 per 1,000 of the home population (13.48 in 1961) compared with 11.9 for England and Wales. The standardised birth rate was 17.52 per 1,000 home population (15.62 in 1961) compared with a rate of 18.0 for the country as a whole. The number of infants who died during the first year of life was 8 (10 in 1961) giving an infant mortality rate of 10.18 per 1,000 live births (14.35 in 1961) compared with 21.6 per 1,000 for England and Wales. This is the lowest rate ever recorded in the Borough. For the fourth successive year there was no maternal death associated with childbirth. Considering that during the past four years there were 2,892 births in the Borough it may be said that the antenatal and obstetric services in the area have worked to a high standard of efficiency. Further, the stillbirth rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births fell to 15.04 (compared with 28.03, 29.65, 26.84, and 18.98 in the previous four years). The number of illegitimate births rose again to 37 compared with 31, 33, 28, 19, 19, 22, 23, 19 and 24 in the previous nine years. Deaths from cancer of the lung numbered 26 (28 in 1961). For the thirteenth year in succession there was no case of diphtheria in the Borough and no case of poliomyelitis in the year under review. 5 The years 1961 and 1962 will be remembered for the fact that on five separate occasions during this period smallpox was brought into this country by air travellers from Karachi resulting in 62 cases in England and Wales of which 24 proved fatal. Although there was no real threat to the Borough an indirect effect of these cases was the overwhelming public demand for vaccination. The occurrence of a single case of smallpox in Woolwich in January, 1962 caused a local agitation for vaccination clinics to be opened in Erith but this was successfully resisted. Nevertheless many hundreds of people in the Borough received vaccination through their family doctors and many cases of vaccinia occurred some of which simulated smallpox and raised difficult problems of diagnosis. 1 should like to place on record the help which we received in this connection from Dr. J. V. Armstrong of the Brook Hospital, one of our local smallpox consultants. It is a matter of continual surprise that public anxiety on such occasions can be so great but that, during quiescent periods, there should be so much neglect of routine vaccination. There are good reasons why parents should ensure the primary vaccination of their children in infancy, not the least being the risk of severe reactions and the possibility, however small, of post-vaccinal encephalitis when primary vaccination against smallpox is carried out in adolescence or in later life. In March, 1962 the report of the Royal College of Physicians on Smoking and Health was published and confirmed very convincingly the association that exists between heavy cigarette smoking and cancer of the lung. Its initial impact on the public was considerable but there is now a real danger that the report, with all its implications, will be forgotten unless vigorous action is taken by the Government, local authorities and other responsible bodies to keep the issue alive as one of the outstanding public health problems of the day. At the time of writing a five-day visit to the area of a mobile unit of the Central Council for Health Education is being planned to act as a spearhead in a week's campaign concerned, mainly, with the problem of smoking by schoolchildren. We are approaching the end of an era in local government in the Greater London Area. With the London Government Act, 1963 on the Statute Book one is becoming increasingly pre-occupied with the future of the Health and Welfare Services in the proposed London Borough 18. 6 The orderly take-over of these services will need careful thought and preparation, particularly in regard to the basic administrative structure to be adopted. This should be such as to allow for the organic growth of these services in the years to come. In conclusion I wish to thank the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their support and encouragement and the Chief Public Health Inspector, Chief Clerk and all members of the Health Department for the good work which has been done during the year. I am, Your obedient servant, JOHN LANDON Medical Officer of Health 7 Annual Report 1962 SECTION A:—STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA A (1) Physical Situation and Amenities Erith is situated in the north-west corner of Kent and is bounded on the north-east by the River Thames to which it has a frontage of about four miles: on the west by the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich and the Borough of Bexley, and on the south by the Borough of Bexley and the Urban District of Crayford. In spite of continuous industrial expansion, the Borough still retains in many places an urban aspect, and views from the many vantage points in the district afford evidence of its undulating nature and the tree endowed areas of Belvedere and Abbey Wood. The shopping centres are advantageously situated having regard to the disposition of the six wards in the Borough and there is a copious supply of pure water which is provided and maintained by the Metropolitan Water Board. The chief industries are light engineering, edible oil refining, manufacture of chemicals, coal shipping and lighterage, and the production of building materials, i.e., stoneware drain pipes and asbestos components. The manufacture of television and radio equipment and toys, are also well established industries. As in other years, industrial expansion has continued. 8 A (2) Comparative Rainfall 1962 1961 Month inches Month Inches January 2.47 January 2.51 February .57 February 1.93 March 1.44 March .07 April 1.70 April 1.76 May 1.86 May 1.08 June .38 June 1.37 July 2.40 July 1.11 August 1.61 August 1.59 September 2.26 September 2.43 October 1.13 October 3.01 November 2.05 November 2.59 December 2.46 December 3.52 Total in inches 20.33 Total in inches 22.97 9 A (3) Unemployment Figures and Comments With the co-operation of the Manager of Erith Employment Exchange, to whom I am indebted for the necessary information, it is once again possible to give definite figures with regard to the state of unemployment in the district, as shown in the following table.

D (1) Refuse Collection and Disposal The method of storage is by means of sanitary dustbins and some 19,600 are emptied weekly. The dustbins are provided and maintained by the owners of the properties concerned, the Council securing this by a local Act—The Erith Improvement Act 1920. The refuse is transported to a Transfer Depot where it is transferred into Contractors' bulk container vehicles, and disposal is effected by tipping at Stone. D (l)a Costs £ s. d.

Corporation sewers have been extended to take the drainage of recently developed housing estates. Of domestic cesspools, 15 are known to exist, and these are subject to regular cleansing and emptying in accordance with the resolution of the Council dated 10th March, 1942. During the year, one cesspool was abandoned. 30 D (5)e Atmospheric Pollution Results of Analysis (A) The Erith Borough Council is represented on the Thames-side Advisory Committee for the Abatement of Atmospheric Pollution. In this connection, a deposit gauge, lead peroxide gauge, and a smoke recorder are respectively in various positions and the analysis of the contents of these gauges for 1962 are as follows:— Month Deposit gauge Lead peroxide gauge Sulphur mg/100 sq cms/day Rain in inches Insoluble deposit Tons per sq. mile Soluble deposit Tons per sq mile Total Solids Tons per sq. mile Calcium Tons per sq. mile January — Deposit gauge damaged — 2.04 February — ,, ,, ,, — 2.96 March 1.48 17.77 7.92 25.69 1.93 2.10 April 1.56 9.01 6.51 15.52 1.21 1.45 May 1.61 10.39 4.50 14.89 0.58 1.06 June 0.35 11.82 5.74 17.56 1.30 0.78 July 2.21 8.37 7.99 16.36 1.40 0.84 August 1.54 5.48 5.03 10.51 0.60 0.64 September 2.02 6.32 6.31 12.63 1.78 0.81 October 1.23 9.89 9.07 18.96 1.90 1.84 November 1.31 3.74 6.34 10.08 1.01 1.88 December 0.82 8.07 6.58 14.65 1.32 3.17 Monthly average for 1961 16.12 1.30 1.66 (B) The combined filter for smoke and sulphur dioxide apparatus which has been in operation at the Town Hall since July, 1958 has been maintained by the Department throughout the year, and the readings and results thereof have been carried out and recorded daily. Appended below are particulars of the highest recorded figures for the year ended 31st December, 1962:— Smoke: Smog level Sulphur dioxide: Smog level (200 mgs. black suspended matter per 100 cu. metres of air) 127 on 5th Dec. Highest reading 1961 71 on 12th Jan. (40 parts per 100 million parts of air) 94 on 5th Dec. Highest reading 1961 23.6 on 8th Dec. 31 (C) The volume of commercial and other mechanical transport using Erith roads continues to increase as a result of which local atmospheric pollution increases proportionately. In June, the Ministry of Transport disclosed that when the first country-wide spot check on diesel fumes was made, one in every eight of the vehicles observed was emitting too much smoke, as a result of which fifty were put off the roads immediately. Meanwhile many and varied devices and additives are being tested by the Warren Spring Laboratory, but it is authoratively stated that as yet, none of the appliances studied has proved satisfactory. At this stage, it is considered that the solution lies in good maintenance, and it is for this reason that the Laboratory is exploring the development of a reliable smoke meter with which existing legislation can be enforced. (D) As recommended by Ministry of Housing and Local Government Circular 42/61, all factory managements were communicated with and reminded that legal defence against dark smoke emission is limited to 5th July, 1963, and that it will no longer be possible to plead as a defence in any proceedings for an offence under Section 1 of the Clean Air Act 1956 that the contravention was due to faulty buildings or equipment, and to inability to remedy this. The majority of factory managements responded that every effort was being made for industrial furnaces to conform with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 1956. As a result of informal action, the following improvements were effected on industrial furnaces:— 1. Two Danks double pass smoke tube boilers (fired by wood chips) converted to oil firing. 2. One new Pratt Daniel Spark Arrestor provided at a foundry. D (5)f Clean Air Act 1956 Borough of Erith (No. 1) Smoke Control Order 1961 On 12th January, 1962, press and other publicity was given to the above, and as no objections were received, the Order was duly confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and will come into operation on the 1st October, 1964. The area in question comprises some 390 acres in which are 3,234 dwellings. Every owner and occupier is being acquainted with the necessary requirements, and during the year many conversions were effected. 32 In June, the Consumer Advisory Council's Shoppers' guide contained a special report on smokeless fuels which in terms of national clean air policy proved to be a disturbing document. Amongst other things, it was stated that between 20% and 28% of the total weight of the fue.ls investigated consisted of water, and with one exception was subject to considerable variation in size. In some cases ash content was excessive and performance on open fires was generally poor, and in consequence of such defections, it is being urged that all producers should work to specification especially in view of the fact that only one of the fuels is at present produced to a British Standard. No complaints regarding smokeless fuel performances in this area have been received. D (5)g Swimming Baths and Pools (1) The Council's open air bath is situated in Stonewood Road, and comprises one pool of 57,000 gallons capacity which now is exclusively used by the Kent Education Committee during normal school hours and local youth clubs during the evenings and on Saturdays. Water in the pool, which originates from a well 40 feet deep, is heated to a reasonable temperature by low pressure steam heating and is sterilised by the chlorine process. There is a slipperbath establishment with accommodation for 16 males and 4 females. Adjacent to the bath is a mechanical laundry which launders on behalf of the various undertakings in the locality and which includes the Corporation Catering Dept., the Works Dept., the County Health and Education Depts.. and the Royal Alfred Seaman's Home. During the year, 71,552 articles were laundered. Attendances at the Swimming Baths for 1962. Swimming pool Slipper baths Schools: During term 10,154 Schools: During holidays 1.864 Youth Clubs 5,946 Total for 1962 17,964 Total for 1962 16.099 Total for 1961 23,434 Total for 1961 15,617 33 (2) A childrens' paddling pool of 60,000 gallons capacity is situated within the Belvedere recreation ground at Woolwich Road, and which, as in previous years proved to be a popular rendezvous during the summer months in which season a successful model power boat regatta is sponsored by the Welling & District Model Engineers Society. The pool is regularly emptied and cleansed during the period it is in use, and methodically dosed with chloros. D (5)h Offensive Trades Other than 11 fish frying establishments, there are no other scheduled offensive trades under Section 107 of the Public Health Act 1936 in the Borough. Fish frying was declared to be an offensive trade on 17th March 1939, and bye-laws were made accordingly. All the fish frying businesses are well conducted and the frying apparatus at each is of modern and approved pattern. D (5)i Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act 1951 There are two registered premises in the Borough in which filling materials as defined in the Act are used. The Act is designed to secure that clean filling materials are used in the upholstery trade, and applies to manufacturers' and dealers' premises alike. The persons operating businesses are dealers, and in addition to regular inspections made at their premises, samples have been obtained and submitted to the Prescribed Analyst for the purpose of testing. A typical Report is as follows:— Tests Results Chlorine content 7 parts per 100,000 Oil content 1.2% Soap content 0.8% 2.0% Soluble impurities (1) 1.4% (2) 1.4% (3) 1.5% Average 1.4% Remarks:—Sample satisfactory. D (5)j Pet Animals Act 1951 There are 5 pet animals shops in the Borough at which a wide variety of domestic pets can be purchased. All the premises were regularly visited and found to be well conducted, and no conditions contrary to the welfare provisions of the above Act have been observed. 34 D (5)k Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960 Under Section 3 of the above Act, there is only one conditionally licensed site existing in the Borough. The site in question consists of one half acre of land on which three caravans are stationed. During the year it was found necessary to eject four unauthorised occupiers from Council owned sites in the Borough. D (5)1 Hop pickers There are no hop fields in the district. D (5)m Rodent control Two fully trained operatives arc employed to deal with rodent infestations at commercial, private and Corporation premises. The numbers of premises inspected and treated during the year are as follows:— Inspected Treated Commercial premises 91 32 Dwellings 832 108 As in other years, Corporation sewers were disinfested twice during the year when manholes were successfully treated with baits consisting of oatmeal, sugar, oil, warfarin, and added preservative. As yet, the use of Sodium Fluoracetate has not been adopted. The Prevention of Damage by Pests (application to Shipping) Order, 1951, applies to the many wharfs, jetties and dry slipways in the Borough, and was implemented by the following visits and inspections being made:— Commercial barges 48 Coastwise vessels 26 Tugs 24 Oil tankers 22 Miscellaneous craft 4 No marine infestations were located during the year. 35 D (5)n Pest control. For many years, the Department has operated a private works scheme with considerable success as a result of which matters which are outside the scope of the statutory provisions of the Public Health Act can be dealt with promptly. This practical assistance of the Department's outdoor service is available to all residents who need such help, in particular having regard to choked waste pipes, soilpipes and drainsand the destruction of ants and wasps nests. The income from the above service amounted to £37 12s. 6d. which represents the cost of materials, etc. used and the apportionment charge on the operative's time. D (5)o Eradication of Bed Bugs The number of dwellings treated during the year is as follows:— Privately owned houses 13 Corporation houses 7 Occupiers are encouraged to reveal promptly any signs of infestation so that the menace can be eradicated in its initial stages. D (5)p Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act 1952 and Regulations 1953 For the purpose of ensuring that gas and electric appliances on sale complied with the above statute, the probe test was applied to 172 fitments, when it was found that all were satisfactory. D (5)q Consumer Protection Act 1961 The Oil Heaters Regulations 1962 The above Regulations impose requirements in relation to domestic space heaters which burn paraffin oil and are not designed for use with a flue. Such appliances must now have warning notices attached at the time of sale, and provision is made for appliances to be purchased by the Local Authority under Paragraph 2 of the Schedule to the Consumer Protection Act 1961 with a view to performance being tested by any body authorised by the Secretary of State. D (5)r Mosquito Control As in other years, the whole of the river frontage has been kept under review, particular attention being paid to the many ditches which intersect the Belvedere and Abbey Wood marsh area and outfall to the River Thames. Possible 36 invasion by mosquitos from home-bound shipping is always under consideration and it is for this reason that all potential breeding grounds and resting places are thoroughly dosed with D.D.T. and Lindane. No complaints were received during the year. D (5)s Agriculture (Safety, Health and Welfare Provisions) Act 1956 No action was necessary at any premises in the Borough with regard to the above Act. D (5)t Agriculture Act 1947 On two separate occasions complaints were received from residents that foxes had invaded the district and that damage to poultry had been inflicted. Each case was fully investigated after which the matter was referred to the Pests Officer of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when the latter took the necessary action to eliminate the marauding foxes. D (5)u Common Lodging Houses There are no registered Common Lodging Houses in the Borough. D (6) Shops Act 1950 The following Closing Orders are in operation in the area:— Closing hour (1) Erith Weekly Half Holiday (No. 1) Order dated 17th February, 1913 1 p.m. Thursday (2) Erith Hairdressers & Barbers Shops Closing Order dated 11th March, 7 p.m. every 1947 evening No partial exemption Orders with regard to Sunda) trading provided for by Section 48 of the Shops Act 1950 exist. In May, the Dartford & District branch of the National Hairdressers' Federation made application to the shops Authority for the Order fixing the closing hour at 7 p.m. to be revoked and requested that individual hairdressers be permitted to choose the day of the week on which they should close for the half day. After due consideration of the matter, the Shops Authority resolved that this request be not granted. 37 No legal proceedings were instituted during the year, but on one occasion it was found necessary to draw the attention of a shopkeeper to statutory provisions regarding Sunday trading. Improvements under Section 38 of the Shops Act 1950 were as follows:— Washing facilities provided 7 Heating provided or improved 13 Seats for assistants provided 9 Lighting improved 5 Sanitary conveniences 11 D (7) Sanitary Accommodation at Offices In accordance with the requirements of section 46 of the Public Health Act, 1936, all new offices constructed in the developing area at Belvedere were provided with suitable and sufficient sanitary accommodation. Many improvements were effected at existing premises. D (8) Street Trading There is no established retail trading from stalls in the Borough. D (9) River Pollution. River Thames—Effluvia. No complaints were received during the year. D (10) Flooding No flooding incidents occurred during the year. D (11) Council Refuse Tip. Regular visits and inspections have been made at the Refuse transit depot in Manor Road, and the necessary action taken with a view to keeping the premises free from vermin. D (12) Noise Abatement Act 1960 On one occasion during the year it was found necessary to request a factory management to reduce the volume of noise. For operating loud speakers on ice-cream vans after 7 Pm. three vendors were prosecuted by the Metropolitan once and in each case a fine of £2 was imposed. 38 D (13) Factories Act 1961 Part 1 of the Act (1) Inspections for purposes of provisions as to health (including inspections made by Public Health Inspectors).

Number granted during the year: 50. D (16) Standard Grants These grants are available for the improvement of dwellings built before1 1945 by the provision of certain amenities. Number granted during the year: 32. 42 D (17) The Rent Act 1957 Action under the Act is enumerated below:— (1) Number of Applications for Certificates of disrepair 7 (2) Number of Certificates issued 0 (3) Number of Revocations applied for 1 (4) Number of Revocations granted 1 No appeals, either by landlords or by tenants, against Local Authority decisions were made to the County Court during the year. The majority of enquiries made with regard to this Act are from tenants desirous of effecting rent reductions because of items of disrepair, but considerable assistance has been given to those seeking information on matters concerning de-control, notice to quit, and tenancy agreements. Having regard to the circumstances, each case is dealt with on its merits. In one instance it was found that the rent limit of a controlled house had been exceeded and that the tenant had overpaid rent by £32. In this case negotiations with the owner resulted in an immediate reimbursement of £10 in cash to the tenant, together with provision for a period of 22 weeks free rental, and to comply with the provisions of Section 1 and the Sixth Schedule, the rent was reduced to twice gross value. 43 SECTION E—WATER SUPPLY—MILK—FOOD AND DRUGS ACT—FOOD INSPECTION E (1) Water supply The Borough is served throughout by the Metropolitan Water Board, the water containing some 30.8 degrees of hardness. Almost without exception, the supply is led direct into the premises served. Twenty four samples drawn from various points in the district have been forwarded to the appropriate Laboratory for bacteriological examination, with satisfactory results. The total length of new mains laid amounted to 550 yards. E (2) Milk supply E(2)a Food and Drugs Act 1955. Section 37. The Milk (Special Designations) (Specified areas) Order 1951. In pursuance of the above Order which has operated since 1st October 1951, all milk which is retailed in the Borougn is specially designated. E (2)b Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960 (a) The designations applicable to milk sold in the Borough are 'Pasteurised,' 'Sterilised' and 'Tuberculin Tested.' Pasteurised milk must be bottled at the premises at which it is heat treated. There are no pasteurising plants and bottling establishments within the Borough. (b) Details of dealers licences to use a special designation in relation to milk which is obtained and sold pre-packed by the dealer are as follows:— Pasteurised 25 Sterilised 14 Tuberculin tested 22 Total 61 44 (c) The following samples of designated milk from various sources and retailed in the Borough were obtained and submitted for examination:— Pasteurised 7 Sterilised 7 Tuberculin Tested 1 Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) 4 Total 19 All satisfied the prescribed tests. E (2)c Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959 Number of registered distributors in Borough 13 Number of dairies 4 Number of milkshops 37 Number of producer/retailers 0 Regular inspections have been made at the above throughout the year. E (2)d Ice-Cream 129 premises in the Borough are registered for the sale of ice-cream. There are 3 active manufacturers of ice-cream (2 bod mix and 1 cold mix). The Ice-cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations 1959. Bacteriological sampling. Nine samples were obtained and forwarded for bacteriological examination with the following result:— Grade 1 9 E (3) Meat and Food Inspection E (3)a Slaughterhouses There is one privately owned slaughterhouse in the Borough in which slaughtering takes place daily, in the evenings of at least three days, and on every Saturday and Sunday. This slaughtering at irregular hours has been maintained 45 throughout the year, and in effecting 100% inspection, the time devoted to; meat inspection is equivalent to the service of a full time Public Health Inspector. Until legislation makes provision for regulating and stabilising hours of slaughter, it would appear that the present exacting situation which the department has to cope with is likely to continue. E (3)b Meat Marking In July 1962, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food issued draft Regulations which would require the inspection of all meat and authorise Local Authorities to make charges for meat inspection. The draft Regulations provide for meat to be stamped in such a way after inspection as to identfy the Local Authority and the inspecting officer. It is anticipated that the proposed new Regulations which will replace the existing Public Health (Meat) Regulations 1924-52, and Regulations 29 and 30(b) of the Slaughterhouse (Hygiene) Regulations 1958 will be made under Part One of the Food and Drugs Act 1955 with application to England and Wales, and that the operative date will be 1st April. 1963. E (3)c Brucellosis By the end of June 1962, 190,000 calves had been vaccinated under the Ministry of Agriculture's free service of vaccinating female calves against contagious abortion. Over 45,000 herd owners have undertaken to use the service since its introduction on 1st May, 1962, but there are many farmers throughout the country who are not yet taking advantage of the service. In past years, the incidence of brucellosis has been reduced largely as a result of vaccination with S.19 vaccine. 46 The following table in prescribed form details the number of carcases inspected and condemned:— Carcases and offal inspected and condemned in whole or in part.

During the normal course of meat inspection by the Public Health Inspectors at the Belvedere slaughterhouse, lesions of generalised tuberculosis were found in two bovine carcases as a result of which the Animal Health Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at Maidstone was notified and veterinary officers were enabled to identify the animals concerned, trace back to the herd of origin and impose restrictions on that herd, including the carrying out of tuberculin tests. E (3)e Foot and Mouth Disease No case of Foot and Mouth Disease occurred in the Borough during the year. E (3)f Other Foods Much time and attention has been devoted to the inspection of food in shops and stores, as a result of which the following was found to be unfit for human consumption, and consequently destroyed:— Tons cwts. qrs. lbs. Tinned and packet food 3 6 0 8 Meat 10 2 1 Rabbits 1 2 0 Chickens 1 1 10 Turkeys 13 Cheese 3 27 Fruit and Vegetables 1 18 3 0 Total weight 5 19 1 3 In March, the Department was notified that a quantity of grossly contaminated tinned liver puree was likely to be in the district as a result of which shops were visited, the tinned food duly located and confiscated. 48 Subsequently legal proceedings under the Food & Drugs Act 1955, were instituted by another Authority and a fine of £10 was imposed in respect of the like commodity which was deposited for sale in that district. Approximately 31 tons of Spanish onions deposited at a wholesaler's premises were found to be unfit for food and consequently confiscated. In view of the considerable weight involved, arrangements were made for the onions to be tipped at the; expense of the owners at a tip in County Kent. The disposal supervision was carried out by a Public Health Inspector. E (3)g Disposal of Unsound Meat and other Food As there are no sterilising facilities for unfit meat at the Belvedere slaughterhouse, such meat is stained with naphthaline green and transported by arrangement for sterilisation elsewhere. All unsound food, exclusive of the above is disposed of by tipping with the town's refuse. E (3)h Slaughter of Animals Act, 1958 Humane slaughtering of all animals in accordance with the above prevails in the Borough. The instruments used are the captive bolt pistol and the electrolethaler. The number of slaughtermen's licences operative is 15 E (3)i Fowl Pest A change in the Goverment's fowl pest policy was announced in July. As from 31st March, 1963, except in Scotland, vaccination of birds is to be substituted for slaughter, and compensation for poultry keepers will cease. Subsidised vaccine is to be provided for two years after which the full cost will have to be paid. 49 E(4) Food and Drugs Act, 1955. Sections 2 and 91. The following samples of food were procured during the year and submitted to the Public Analyst for the purpose of analysis with the results as follows:— Article Adulterated Intermediate Genuine No. of Samples Milk - - 19 19 Margarine — — 5 5 Cheese — — 4 4 Sauce — — 5 5 Sponge and cake mixtures — — 5 5 Ice-cream — — 5 6 Meat and fish pastes — — 3 3 Fruit - - 5 5 Meat - - 4 4 Fish - - 3 3 Sausage & sausage meats - - 3 3 soft drinks - - 4 4 Medicines - - 5 5 Milk puddings - 1 2 3 Butter - - 2 2 Spices and herbs - - 5 5 Cooking fats - - 2 2 Peas pudding — — 1 1 Steak & kidney pudding — 1 1 2 Flavouring essence - - 3 3 Colouring essence - - 1 1 Cake decorations - - 2 2 Condiments - - 3 3 Curry - - 2 2 Slimming biscuits - - 1 1 Mint jelly - - 1 1 Coffee - - 2 2 Biscuits - - 1 j Carawheat - - 1 ] Cream - - 2 2 Bouillon cakes - - 1 1 Jelly - - 1 1 Marmalade - - 1 j Flour - - 1 1 Desiccated coconut - - 1 1 Bread - 1 - 1 Eclair - 1 - 1 Gelatine - - 3 3 Christmas pudding - - 1 1 Mincemeat - - 1 I Marzipan - - 1 1 Almonds — - 2 2 Total — 4 115 119 With regard to four intermediate reports, warning letters were sent to the retailers concerned. The milk samples had an average fat content of 3.6% and 8.7% solids not fat, the prescribed standard of which is 3% and 8.5% respectively. 50 E(5) Food Hygiene. The Food Hygiene (General) Regulations 1960. Almost without exception, the sale of food is limited to shop premises, and neither street trading nor mobile vehicle trading seems to have any attraction for the average food purchaser in the Borough of Erith. Of the many competitive fried fish vans and hot-pie contraptions which formerly were seen from time to time in the Borough during nocturnal hours, none now exist, and trading is established at the more usual food premises. During the year considerable improvements have been carried out at foodshops, and having regard to the availability of ample food supplies it is apparent that the majority of trade.rs are most conscious of a discriminating purchasing public, and this in itself considerably aids an all-round improvement in the display of foodstuffs in an endeavour to attract the hygienic minded purchasers. All the 34 public houses in the Borough have been inspected as a result of which many sanitary and other improvements have been carried out, and where necessary, recommendations have been made with a view to improving food service.
