It was stated in the last Annual Report that the Vestry had passed a resolution approving of the purchase of the Workhouse, &c., belonging to the parish at Little Chelsea, by the Guardians of St. George's Union, provided satisfactory terms could be arranged. The Vestry after waiting by Deputation on the President of the Local Government Board, and consultation with the Guardians, agreed to sell the property for the sum of £40,000. The Local Government Board have issued an order directing the sale and purchase at the sum named, but, have extended the payment of the purchase money over nine half years, from September, 1875. The Vestry have referred the drawing up of an agreement for securing the payment of the purchase money, and for protecting the interests of the parish during the payment of the purchase money, to the parish Solicitors, and there the matter now rests. Gas Supply to Public Lamps. The Vestry having had under consideration the desirability of taking the supply of gas to the public lamps, by the average motor system, after much enquiry and consideration, came to the following resolution on the subject, viz.:— 1st.—That in future the whole of the Lamps in the Parish be lighted a uniform number of hours, and instead of the Lamps being lighted as at present (some 4,380 hours, and others 4,500 hours), a modified system of lighting be adopted. 31 2nd.—That in consequence of the saving likely to be thus effected, a competent person be appointed to act as Gas Inspector, whose duty will be to constantly examine the various Lamps throughout the Parish, with a view of detecting any Lamps either not lighted, or not consuming the stipulated quantity of Gas, or that may be deficient in illuminating power, to call the attention of the Gas Company to such as may come under his notice, and to personally test or see tested with the officers of the Company such burners and regulators, and to report generally on the state of the Lamps weekly to the Committee of Works. 3rd.—That a uniform quality of Gas be consumed throughout the Parish, if possible. The Vestry being of opinion that it is not desirable to pay for two sorts of Gas, viz., Cannel and Common, at two separate prices, as is now the system. 4th.—That with a view of ascertaining the actual quantity of Gas consumed, a limited number of the most improved Meters be fixed to certain Lamps in such parts of the Parish as the Vestry shall hereafter decide, the lighting and extinguishing of which to be entirely under the control and management of the Surveyor for a given time. 5th.—That it may hereafter become advantageous both to public and private consumers in the Parish, that pressure gauges should be fixed in the In and Out Wards to test the pressure of Gas supplied. 32 6th.—That in the event of the Gas Company objecting to the adoption of these suggestions, the Meter system be adopted. These resolutions were communicated to the Gas Light and Coke Company, and The London Gas Light Company. The former Company declined to accede to the conditions sought to be imposed, and gave notice under the 38 sec. of the City of London Gas Act, 1868, of their intention to apply to the Gas Referees, to prescribe and certify the mode of ascertaining the quantity of Gas consumed by the public Lamps. The London Company have offered to arrange for a reduction in the number of lighting hours, and a proportionate reduction in the charge per Lamp per annum. The whole matter is now referred to a Committee for consideration and arrangement. Proposed Rochester Row Improvement. The Vestry during the year joined with the Board of Works for the Westminster District, in Memorializing the Metropolitan Board of Works to carry out as a Metropolitan Improvement, the Improvement of the approach between Rochester Row and Victoria Street, either by widening Strutton Ground, or by continuing Artillery Row into Rochester Row, and widening the short street known as Old Rochester Row. The Metropolitan Board informed the Vestry, in reply, that they saw no reason to depart from the decision arrived at, on a previous memorial of the Westminster Board, namely, that the Improvement is not one which should be undertaken by the Board at the cost of the Metropolis at large: but that it is a local Improvement, 33 towards the cost of which the Board would be prepared to contribute one half, on application being made by the local authorities for the purpose. Proposed Removal of Harewood Gates. The Vestry acceded to a request from the Vestry of St. Marylebone, to join that Vestry in suggesting to the Earl of Harewood, that directions should be given for the opening of the gates at Harewood-place, daily, for a few hour3 in the afternoon. The joint application was laid before the Earl of Harewood, and his lordship, in reply, informed the Vestries that he could not comply with their request. The Vestry then called the attention of the Metropolitan Board of Works, to the necessity for some steps being taken to relieve the large amount of traffic, passing up and down Regent-street and Bond-street, to and from Oxford-street, and suggested their obtaining Parliamentary powers to throw open Harewood-place, to carriage traffic. The Board replied that they did not consider it advisable to act upon the suggestion of the Vestry. Continuation of Chelsea Embankment up to Chelsea Suspension Bridge. The Vestry in October, 1875, having heard that it was the intention of the Metropolitan Board of Works to apply to Parliament, for powers placing the Chelsea Embankment under their management, asked the Board to also apply for power to enable them to complete the footway and roadway and lighting, and the granite facing of the Embankment, up to the Suspension Bridge in this Parish, and to continue the parapet wall of the Embank- c 34 ment eastward to the point where the roadway diverges from the river wall; and, further, to vest the maintenance and management of the whole Embankment, from Chelsea Suspension Bridge to Old Battersca Bridge, in the Board. In the subsequent Session of Parliament, the Metropolitan Board of Works (various powers) Bill was introduced, and in the Bill it was proposed to seek powers for placing the management, control, and authority of maintaining and lighting the Embankment wall and the adjoining footway of the Chelsea Embankment, under the Metropolitan Board of Works; but the request of the Vestry was not adopted. The Vestry then (in March, 1876) memoralized the Board to complete the Embankment up to the Chelsea Suspension Bridge, and to undertake the management of the part of the Embankment in this parish, to the same extent as was proposed to be done in the matter of the portion in Chelsea parish. The Vestry received a reply, stating that the Board, having given careful attention to the subject, did not consider it expedient to comply with the request of the Vestry. Separation op City of London from rest of Metropolis for carrying out "Artizans and Labourers Dwellings' Improvement Act, 1875." The Vestry on 18th November, 1875, passed the following resolution, which they communicated to the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, viz.:— "That in view of the large amounts that the Metropolitan Board of Works will have to expend in carrying out the various improvement schemes under ' The Artizans and Labourers 35 Dwellings' Improvement Act, 1875,' the Metropolitan Board of Works be respectfully urged not to contribute to the Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London, any sum of money towards improvements in the City." New Valuation List. The New Valuation List prepared in accordance with the Valuation Act, (Metropolis) 1869, was deposited on the 31st May, 1875, as required by the Act. The List was prepared by a Committee of Vestry, acting in conjunction with the four Overseers. Messrs. Castle & Son, of Chancery Lane, were employed to re-value the Gas and Water and Railway Companies properties in the parish, as well as the New Western Pumping Station, belonging to the Metropolitan Board of Works. The List contains 11,241 assessments. The totals of the first Valuation List, made under the provisions of the Valuation Act, in 1870, were, after appeal, gross value, £1,641,449 ; rateable value, £1,368,999. The totals of the new List, made in 1875, after appeal, are, gross value, £1,794,292; rateable value, £1,499,954, an increase of £152,843 gross value, and £130,955 rateable value. There were 5 appeals to Special Sessions, and 7 to General Assessment Sessions. Of the appeals to Special Sessions, 2 were allowed by the Justices and 3 were dismissed; of the appeals to the Assessment Sessions, 2 were abandoned by the appellants on going into Court, c 2 36 1 was referred to arbitration, 1 was allowed, and in the 3 remaining cases the Court fixed the Assessments at figures below those adopted by the Committee, but in excess of those desired by the appellants. The Vestry were appellants to General Assessment Sessions in one case, against a reduction made by the Magistrates sitting in Special Sessions, and were successful in their appeal. Charities. A copy of the account for the year 1875, submitted by the Churchwardens, of the expenditure by the Rector and themselves as trustees for Charities belonging to this Parish, is printed in Appendix No. 5. Sacramental Alms' Fund.—Parish Church. The money collected at the Offertory of Holy Communion, is under the control of the Rector and Churchwardens, who dispose of it in monthly payments, of seven shillings each, to about eighty poor and aged persons, selected from the parochial district of the Parish Church. The amount distributed during the past year (viz., from Ascension Day, 1875, to Ascension Day, 1876) was £325 17s.

Valuation Bill. A Bill to consolidate and amend the laws relating to the value of property for the purpose of rates and taxes. By this Bill it was proposed to repeal the Valuation (Metropolis) Act of 1869, and whilst most of the clauses in this Act were re-introduced into the Bill, there were objections entertained by the Vestry to several new proposals; they waited on the President of the Local Government Board by deputation, and laid before him a statement of their objections. That gentleman promised to give the statement his consideration. The Bill was withdrawn. Metropolis Gas Companies Bill. The Vestry in two successive years (1875-6) have had under consideration a Bill introduced into Parliament on behalf of the Metropolitan Board of Works, to make further provision for regulating the supply of Gas to the Metropolis. With regard to the statutory 10 per cent. maximum dividend, the Vestry passed the following resolution:— "That the Vestry object to any rate of dividend becoming prescribed or statutory in the interests of the Gas Companies, on the ground that the tendency of such regulation is to take away all inducement to economy in the production of Gas." Both Bills were referred to a select Committee, and the Vestry, in addition to forwarding a copy of the resolution to the Metropolitan Board of Works, also forwarded a copy to the Chairman of the select Committee in each year. The Bill is now before Parliament, 41 Subway between Victoria Stations. Notices were given and Plans were deposited in November, 1875, of an intended application to Parliament, for power to enable the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Company, to construct and maintain a Subway between the Victoria Stations, respectively of the Company, the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company, and the Metropolitan District Railway Company, passing under the yard in front of the Station, and under the Wilton Road. The Vestry with a view of protecting the interests of the parish in the Sewers, &c., of the Wilton Road, lodged a Petition praying to be heard by Counsel against the Bills. Subsequently this Petition was referred to the parish Solicitors to draw Clauses for protecting the parish, for insertion in the Bill. The Clauses drawn by the parish Solicitors were adopted, and, with these added to the Bill it was passed. During the year 34 communications have been received from the Superintending Architect of the Metropolitan Board of Works, notifying the applications made for the consent of the Board to the erection of porticoes, bay windows, additions, or other alterations to property within the line of area in this Parish. A list of these communications, with the opinion of the Vestry, and the decision of the Metropolitan Board of Works upon each application, is submitted in Appendix No. 9. Sixty-eight applications for permission to build or alter vaults, areas, dung pits, and other works, abutting upon or under the public way, have been considered by the Vestry. A list of the various applications, with the decision of the Vestry, is printed in Appendix No. 10. 42 LIST OF CHARITIES. Lyon's Estate Charity.

The duties of the Trustees, Receiver and Clerk, are laid down in the Scheme, and the application of the income is as follows, viz.:— "After providing for any costs or expenses which may from time to time be directed by any Court or authority of competent jurisdiction to be paid out of the funds of the Charity, and paying the current expenses of the management and administration of the trust, in pursuance of this Scheme, the Trustees shall, until the further order or direction of the Court of Chancery, from time to time pay three-fifth parts (not exceeding £600) of the net annual income to the Treasurers or other the persons for the time being acting in the administration of the funds of King's College Hospital in Portugal-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, and the remaining two-fifth parts (not exceeding £400) of such net annual income to the Treasurers or other the persons for the time being acting in the administration of the funds of Charing-cross Hospital in Agar-street, Strand, such payments to be received by the said Hospitals respectively on the conditions hereinafter mentioned:— "I, The Governors of King's College Hospital shall set apart twenty-four beds, and the Governors 47 of Charing-cross Hospital shall set apart sixteen beds, in a convenient part or parts of their respective Hospitals, and shall receive therein such patients' (herein called inpatients), being sick and otherwise qualified according to the provisions hereof, as shall be sent by the Trustees with in-patients' orders as hereinafter provided. "II. The said Governors respectively shall also receive and supply with advice and medicine as out-patients all poor persons resident in the said several Parishes who shall be sent by the Trustees with out-patients' or-ders at the customary times for the attendance of out-patients. "III. The Secretaries of the said Hospitals respectively shall give immediate notice to the Clerk of all vacancies in the number of the inpatients, and of any person being rejected as an in-patient. "IV. All in-patients requiring medical or surgical aid, and being fit cases for Hospital treatment, shall be received by both Hospitals indiscriminately, whether suffering from contagious or infectious disorders or not (smallpox alone being excepted), and shall be treated in all respects in the same manner as the other patients received into the Hospitals respectively." The orders for admission as in-patients or for treatment as out-patients in the Hospitals, are granted by an Order Committee, consisting of five Trustees, one member of the Committee being elected from each Parish interested. 48 A new Scheme is to be obtained, if by the falling in of leases or otherwise the net income of the Charity shall excced £1,000, or if at any time from change of circumstances or otherwise, Her Majesty's Attorney-General should be of opinion that further arrangements are desirable. Samaritan Fund. In the year 1802 the sum of £50 was left by Lady Williams to the poor of this Parish. The sum having been handed to the Clerk of the Governors and Directors of the Poor, they, under the authority of the 13th section of "The Parish Local Act" (7 Geo. IV., cap. exxi.), on the 21st May, 1862, resolved:— "That a book be provided, called the Samaritan Fund Book, in which the amount should be entered; that the money be kept in the Clerk's hands, and disposed of, from time to time, by this Board, the sums given being signed by the presiding Chairman of the day. Subsequently the Board further resolved:— ''That a box be placcd at the House in Mount-street with the following inscription,—'Samaritan Fund of St. Ceorge, Hanover-square, for the Relief, by Gift, of such Poor Persons as the Poor Board cannot, by law, assist with Moneyand "That the Governors and Directors of the Poor, for the time being, constitute a Committee for the distribution of the Samaritan Fund." Upon the formation of St. George's Union, the Fund was handed over to Trustees, for the benefit of the poor of this Parish. The box is retained at the Mount-street 49 Workhouse, and the funds arising therefrom are distributed by the Trustees, upon the recommendations of the Board of Guardians of St. George's Union. The following is a list of the Resolutions, of an active character, which have been passed by the Vestry, since March, 1873: — The Resolutions passed between 1856 and March 1873, are printed in the previous report.

My Lords and Gentlemen, I beg to submit this my Second Annual Report of the various Works which have been carried out during the year ended Lady-day, 1876, also a statement shewing the actual cost incurred in each department. Maintenance of Roads. It will be remembered that the winter of the past year has been a most trying one; such perhaps as has not been experienced for many years; consequently, owing to the severe frosts and the almost unprecedented falls of snow and wet, the roads have been reduced to a very bad condition. The filthy state of the streets also during the past winter caused repeated complaints, and the question of street cleansing generally attracted considerable public attention. Many and varied were the suggestions thrown out for the better removal of snow from the streets (none of which, however, were at all practicable in London) ; and also for clearing away the slop, &c. Indeed, so much had been said and written upon the subject, and it had become one of such importance, that I felt it my duty to express my opinion on the matter in the form of a report, which I submitted to a Sub-Committee, who at the time had the question of street cleansing under consideration. 53 The streets of this Parish, in common with those of others, were undoubtedly at times during the period referred to in a very dirty condition; every exertion, however, was made to have them kept clean, but the accumulation of slop was so overwhelming that it was quite impossible to do so in a satisfactory manner. I may add also, and I think with truth, that the streets of this Parish are under equal conditions, always kept as clean and in as good repair as those of any other Parish in the Metropolis. I may mention also an improvement, which was carried out with the view to protect the property of that portion of South Belgravia abutting on the river Thames from being inundated during heavy floods. The roadway known as the Grosvenor Road (from St. George's Square to opposite Messrs. Simpson's factory,) has been considerably raised, some portions as much as 3 feet 6 inches. So far, this improvement has been successful, for during the last flood (in November, 1875,) which is stated, I believe, to have been the highest ever known, the water did not reach the centre of the roadway by several inches. The cost of this work was £252, towards which His Grace the Duke of Westminster contributed £100. The following statement shews the quantity of material used in the maintenance and repairs of the various roads in the Parish, and the total amount expended, including labour:— Granite. Tons. Flints.

The steam roller has worked continuously on the granite and flint roads, and, as regards the former, very satisfactorily. For flint roads, however, a horse roller of less weight (viz., 5 tons) has been purchased, at a cost of £90, which is more suitable. The cost of maintenance, including all expenses of every description, is as follows:— March 25th, 1876. £ s. d. Wages 162 18 10 Cartage of Water 117 1 0 Oil, Tallow, Waste, &c. 26 0 7½ Coke 91 7 6 Coals (estimated) 6 0 0 Firewood 9 0 0 Repairs by Messrs.

Two small portions of wood pavement have been laid down in the Parish during the past year, one in Wilton Road, opposite the entrance to the Victoria Station, the other in the Uxbridge Road, adjoining "Henson's" pavement in Oxford Street; the former comprising an area of about 150 yards, was laid by the Patentee, at his own expense; the latter by the "Improved Wood Pavement Company," at a cost to the Parish of £293, being at the rate of 15s. per square yard. The portions of wood pavement which have been laid in Piccadilly by the Improved Wood Pavement Company, in 1873, have worn exceedingly well, and are at present in very good condition. 55 Maintenance of Footways and Carriageways. There have been constantly employed during the last year, in the various repairs, &c., four masons and four paviours, they have re-laid certain portions of the foot and carriageways which were worn, sunk, or broken, using new materials supplied by contract where the old was not fit to re-lay; they have also made good the pavements disturbed for gas, water, new buildings, alterations, &c. They have used during the year 963 super, yards of York paving, and the cost has been as follows:— £ s. d. South Belgravia 305 3 11½ Grosvenor-place District 236 8 7½ In Wards 489 5 l £1030 17 8 Carriageways.

The Socéité Francaise des Asphaltes have, during the year paved the following footways with asphalte, which has been carried out at the rate of 5s. per yard super., including the Portland cement concrete foundation, 3 in. thick and f in. of asphalte. The work has been done in a very satisfactory manner, and promises to be a cleanly and durable footway. With the view of testing the merits of asphalte as a 56 footway paving, the Vestry have had several samples laid down in this Parish, and so far as I am able to judge from my experience, I am of opinion that the asphalte laid by this Company is the most suitable. The following footways have been re-laid with this asphalte at a cost of £771 13s. 8d. Super. Yards.

The cleansing of the streets has been done by men in the employment of the Vestry. The sweepings in the In Wards were removed under contract by Mr. T. Hobbs, Jun.; the sweepings in the Out Wards have been carted from the streets by the Parish carts to the Parish Wharf, and thence barged away by contract. With the view of preventing disagreeable smells which were complained of, the principal thoroughfares have, as occasion required, been thoroughly washed, and the effect has proved so beneficial that during the past summer I have not received a single complaint. Watering the Streets. The spreading of the water in the streets of the In W ards has been done by Mr. T. Ilobbs, Jun.; in the Out Wards by the horses and carts belonging to the Vestry. The water for the In Wards is supplied by the Grand Junction Water Company, and that in the Out Wards by the Chelsea Water Company. Stock of Plant and Materials. The valuation of the plant and materials, consisting of 1 steam roller, 1 horse roller, 28 horses, 27 slop carts, and 14 water carts, 12 water vans, 4 shoot carts, &c., &c., the property of the Vestry, at the expiration of the parochial year, was £6631 7s. 7½d. 4 horses have been purchased since Lady-day, 1875, at a cost of 343 guineas, as follows:— 1 at 95 guineas. „ 80 „ „ 68 „ 100 „ 343 guineas. 4 horses have been sold during the year, and have realized 200 guineas. 59 Sewers. The sewers in the Parish have been cleansed, repaired, and flushed from time to time by the workmen in the employment of the Vestry. New gullies have been fixed for carrying off surface water, and gullies and ventilators have been trapped and repaired in all cases where necessary. The Committee of Works having given instructions, as occasion offered, to fix ventilators over all man-holes which were found unprovided with gratings, not only to promote the better circulation of air in the sewers, but also to prevent the accumulation of coal-gas at those places, I have had a proper ventilator fixed in every case where such is found.

MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH (BEING HIS FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT.) To the Vestry of the Parish of St. George, HANOVER SQUARE My Lords and Gentlemen, The statistical tables in this Report have been, as a matter of necessity, compiled from the Annual Summary of the Registrar-General, just as my monthly statistical reports are compiled from his weekly returns. This has been necessitated by the Registrar-General's discontinuing to send me the weekly returns made by the Local Registrars of Births and Deaths, and by the fact that you have not considered yourselves justified in paying the Local Registrars for supplying me with copies of their returns, considering that they are already sufficiently paid by the public, and that the returns they make are public property. This is a very serious loss to my department, as by it I am deprived of the official account of the localities in which diseases are prevalent, and of one of my most important sources of information 62 of the existence of infectious diseases, as will be more fully explained in the body of the Report. From Table I. it will be seen that the total number of deaths, viz.: 1867, was higher than it has been in any year since 1871, and higher than the average for the seven years, 1868-1874; but it must be noted that the number of deaths in Public Institutions in the Parish, 502, was very high indeed, our due share of such deaths being only 362. Table I. YEAR. Jan. to Mar. April to June July to Sept. Oct. to Dec.

I estimate the population of the parish at the middle of the year at 90,628, almost exactly one thirty-eighth part of the estimated population of London at the same date, so that the corrected death-rate has been 19.05 per thousand per annum, as against 18.56 in 1874, and the difference in the death-rate is not so much as might at first sight have been expected from the gross totals of deaths. The general London death-rate was 23.7 in 1875, and 22.5 in 1874, showing a far greater difference than that of St. George's, which proves that the causes of the increased mortality are general, and have operated less in our parish than in London generally. The corrected death-rate in the western districts was 22.1, or 3 05 higher than in St. George's, while the general London rate was no less than 4.75 higher than ours. The lowness of our death-rate for the year is also illustrated by the fact that it is less than that of any of the large towns mentioned by the Registrar-General, the nearest to it being Portsmouth, with a rate of 19.5, and the farthest from it Salford, with one of 31.5 per thousand per annum. Table II. shows that the number of births was rather smaller than in 1874, but rather larger than in 1873; the birth-rate was 24.12 per thousand per annum, a very low rate, as usual; that of London being 35.7, and the average for the 21 large towns being 37.1 per thousand per annum. 64 Table II. Births, and Death-rates among Children. REGISTERED BIRTHS, 1875 Deaths of Children under l Year. Total Per-centage to Registered Births. Per-centage to Total Deaths. 1st Quarter 619 345 15.75 18.48 2nd „ 541 3rd „ 513 4th „ 518 Total 2191 The number of deaths of children under one year was 345, being 15.75 per cent, of the registered births, as against 16.2 per cent, in London generally, both being rather larger per centages than last year; but the per centage of deaths under one year to total deaths was only 18.48, whereas it was 19.57 last year, that is to say, that, compared with the aggregate number of deaths at all ages, there were fewer deaths of children under one year of age in 1875 than in 1874. Vaccination. By the courtesy of the Public Vaccinators, I am enabled to give the following return of the numbers of persons Vaccinated or Re-vaccinated by them during the 52 weeks. District. Vaccinator. Vaccinations. Re-vaccinations. Total. Hanover Square and May Fair Mr. E. D. Jay 139 0 139 Belgravia Dr. E. L. Webb 487 7 494 Knightsbridge Mr. G. H. Pedler 76 0 76 702 7 709 65 Persons are also encouraged to take their children to St. George's Hospital for gratuitous vaccination, and 790 vaccinations have been performed there during the year. I am of course unable to give any account of the total number's of children vaccinated, or of persons revaccinated throughout the parish. Table III., which should contain a detailed account of the diseases which have proved fatal during the year, is absent from the report for the reason stated at the beginning. The same remark applies to the Table which should show the number of deaths from certain important classes of diseases. I may state here that the number of persons of 60 years of age and upwards who died during the year was 469, or 25.2 per cent, of the gross total of deaths, as against only 20.6 per cent, for London generally. The number of deaths from violence was 84, equal to 4.5 per cent, of the total deaths, or to 9 per 10,000 inhabitants; in London generally there were only 8 deaths from violence per 10,000 inhabitants; our parish contains one half of the Serpentine. There were 112 inquests held. From Table IV. we see that, as usual, the birth-rate and death-rate are different in the 3 Sub-districts into which the parish is divided, Belgravia having the highest rates, and May-fair the lowest; the death-rate in Belgravia, including Pimlico, was, however, more than 3 per 1,000 per annum less than that of London generally, Avhile that in May-fair was no less than 10.3 per thousand less than the London general rate. These rates are all calculated on the numbers corrected for the deaths in Public Institutions throughout London, and this, while reducing the rates of the other two Sub-districts somewhat, raises that of Hanover-square. It will be observed that the death-rate of the Hanover-square Sub-district is smaller than its birth-rate, which was not the case last year. e 66 I estimate the population of these Sub-districts, at the middle of the year 1875, as follows:—Hanover square, 18,215; May-fair, 13,080; and Belgravia, 59,303; total, 90,628, as before stated.

During March there were more births (230), and more deaths (232) than during any other month. Table V. shows that the number of deaths from the principal infectious diseases and from diarrhoea, 227, was larger than the numbers for the two previous years; almost the same as in 1872, and less than the average of the last seven years; there were, as in 1874, no deaths from smallpox, but the deaths from all these diseases, except diarrhoea, were considerably more numerous in 1875 than in 1874, or in 1873. Measles was epidemic during the year and caused 30 deaths, the average number during the previous seven years being 24.1. 67 Table V.

Diphtheria was unusually fatal, causing 16 deaths, or nearly twice the annual average; this disease is frequently associated with scarlet fever. Whooping Cough caused 42 deaths, rather fewer than the annual average, but more than during either of the two previous years. Fever—Including typhus, enteric or typhoid, and simple continued fever, caused no less than 37 deaths, a larger number than in either of the previous seven years except 1870, when it caused 41 deaths. Diarrhœa caused rather fewer deaths than the average number. The 227 deaths from these diseases are equivalent to a rate of 2.5 per 1000 of the population; the rate for London generally was 3.9, and that for 18 of the largest English towns (including London) was 4.4, neither of those towns having as low a rate as ours. During the year the numbers of cases of, and deaths from, these diseases reported to the Sanitary Inspector were as follows:— Cases (not fatal) Deaths. Scarlet fever 68 4 Small pox 2 0 Enteric fever 7 2 Typhus 0 0 Cholera 0 1 In all these instances, reported by Medical men and by the Relieving Officers, thorough disinfection of the places and clothing was carried out, according to the 69 requirements of each, and in the case of enteric fever, structural sanitary defects were often found and remedied. But it appears from the Registrar General's Returns that there were 40 deaths from scarlet fever, 16 from diphtheria and 37 from fever in the parish during the year, so that out of 93 deaths from these important preventable diseases only six were reported to the Sanitary Inspector, and we had no knowledge of where the other 87 deaths occurred cr what precautions were taken to prevent the spread of the diseases by means of infected bedding, clothing, &c. This shows, I think, quite clearly, that it is necessary that in some way or another I should be supplied with the mortality returns, and especially with details of the deaths from infectious diseases. As regards the cases which do not prove fatal, there is at present no official way of obtaining information about them, still, as has been shown, a considerable number are reported to us. Sanitary Work. For the year ending March 3lst, 1876. The following Table has been compiled for me by Mr. Dickson, your Sanitary Inspector, from his Report book. Table VI. Various kinds of Complaints of Nuisances, &c., from April lst, 1875, to March 31st, 1876. Total number of complaints 350 Notices served103 Houses and premises limewhited and general repairs 94 Houses disinfected after infectious diseases 71 Drains trapped, ventilated, &c.; sinks repaired, and in some cases new pipes 27 70 Closets supplied with water 22 Dust bins renewed, repaired, new covers, &c. 12 Cisterns repaired, new covers, &c. 9 Removal of animals improperly kept, (cases of) 4 Meat and fish condemned (cases of) 2 Drains and closets unstopped 18 Overcrowding abated 2 Cesspools abolished 4 Street gullies trapped on account of bad smells 15 Cases removed to hospitals 20 Old people living in filthy rooms removed 2 Inspection of houses after cases of typhoid and low fever 11 Legal proceedings taken 1 Accumulation of dung, straw, &c., removed 21 Bake-houses in the Parish 77 Licensed cow-houses 7 Licensed slaughter-houses 14 The articles disinfected in the hot-air disinfecting chamber belonging to the Parish, were as follows:— 89 Beds 74 Bolsters 113 Mattresses 135 Pillows 33 Palliasses 64 Carpets 57 Quilts 19 Hearth-rugs 200 Blankets 39 Curtains 63 Sheets 7 Counterpanes 43 Dresses 72 Pillow-cases 14 Window-blinds 12 Towels 46 Table-covers 30 Cushions 24 Bed-hangings 21 Shawls 43 Suits of Clothing and a large quantity of sundry articles. 71 This, of course, does not include minor complaints, nor does it show the total number of visits of Inspection made. The number of complaints of general nuisances was much less than in the preceding year, which is, of course, satisfactory; but the number of houses and of articles of clothing, &c., disinfected after infectious diseases was much greater, on account of the greater prevalence of those diseases, and the large number of cases about which information was given to the Sanitary Officers: 20 persons suffering from infectious diseases were removed to the Fever Hospitals, Although there were a considerably larger number of deaths from fever than in the preceding year, fewer houses were inspected after fever (enteric, low fever, &c.) ant) the number of cases reported to the Sanitary Inspector did not even equal the number of deaths from the disease. A death occurred in July, with all the symptoms of Malignant Cholera; thorough disinfection was at once carried out and the bedding burnt—there were no other cases. It will be seen that although 103 formal notices were served, it was only necessary to take proceedings once during the year; a sufficient proof that notices are not sent without sufficient reason, and that your Sanitary Officers do their utmost to get nuisances abated without the annoyance and expense attending prosecutions. The exception was in the case of a person who was summoned for default of payment for work done by order of the Vestry (supply of water to a closet), and was imprisoned for 6 weeks. The Slaughter-houses, Cow-sheds and Bake-houses of the Parish are regularly inspected, and are kept in a 72 cleanly condition; of the 19 Slaughter-houses, only 14 were re-licensed by the Magistrates, as the licenses were not applied for in 3 cases, and in two others the Metropolitan Board of Works successfully opposed the renewal of the licenses, because they were not constructed in accordance with the Bye-laws which the Board are empowered to enforce. The bad smells in Piccadilly and in Knightsbridge were complained of during the summer, but not to the same extent as in the preceding year; I may add that Piccadilly has since been paved with wood, and that no smells along it have been complained of since, or perceived by me or by the Sanitary Inspectors; this fact, I think, quite justifies the statement in my last Annual Report that the Piccadilly Sewer was not in fault, as was very generally supposed to be the case, but that the smells arose from the uncleanly condition of the roadway. The water supplied by the Grand Junction and Chelsea Water Companies was analysed from time to time, and found to be of average purity, except at the beginning of the year and in the month of November, when the filtration was inefficient on account of the heavy floods in the river. The common gas supplied by the London Gas Company has been examined by me from time to time at their testing room, and has always been found to be above the required standard of illuminating power, to contain occasionally faint traces of Ammonia and to be free from Sulphuretted Hydrogen. For the information of the parishioners, I may mention that a hospital carriage for removing persons suffering 73 from infectious diseases is kept at the workhouse, in Mount Street; but those who are in a position to bear the expenses of their support, should apply at the London Fever Hospital, Liverpool Road, Islington, where they can be accommodated on favourable terms. I have the honour to be, My Lords and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. H, CORFIELD, M.A., M.D, (Oxon.), F.R.C.P (London), Medical Officer of Health. 10, Bolton row, May Fair, W. June, 1876. APPENDIX TO THE REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health. Summary of Analytical Work for the Year ending March 31st, 1876. Milk.—32 samples were analysed, of which 14 were found to be genuine, 10 of poor quality or skimmed, and 8 watered. Notice of intention to submit for purposes of analysis was given in four instances, but only one of the samples was found to be adulterated so as to warrant a prosecution; in this case a fine of 42s. and costs was imposed. Bread.—16 samples were analysed and all found to be genuine. 74 Butter.— Of 5 samples, 3 were found to be genuine, one poor, and one largely adulterated with foreign fats, and a certificate to that effect was given to the purchaser. Tea.— Of 8 samples analysed, 5 were genuine, 2 fairly good and one contained exhausted leaves. Vinegar.— Of 4 samples, got to obtain information, 3 were genuine and 1 adulterated with Sulphuric Acid. Cream.— One sample, brought by a parishioner, was genuine. Whiskey.— A sample, which had been complained of, was found to be genuine. Of the above 67 samples only 3 were brought by parishioners, and only one bought by the Inspector on the complaint of a parishioner; 2 were procured by me from a house where there was a case of enteric fever, and the rest were all bought by the Inspector under my instructions.
