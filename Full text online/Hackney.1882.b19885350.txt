10 number of houses, be sufficient to shew that there are manymore residents there than in 1881. In West Hackney there were only 625 deaths in 1882 against 678 in 1881, but this decrease was caused to a great extent by the diminution in this year of deaths from diarrhoea, which disease causes ordinarily more than its fair proportion of deaths in this sub-district. In Hackney sub-district there were fewer deaths than in 1881, viz., 1698 against 1728; whilst in South Hackney there were only 628 deaths against 700 in 1881.

LONDON: A. T. Roberts, Son & Co., Printers, 5, Hackney Road, E. 1883. REPORT FOR 1882. As some very unusual defects in the drainage of houses have come under my notice during this year, chiefly in connection with cases of diphtheria and typhoid fever, I propose stating them at some length, as well as one or two other instances which have been noted in former years. In one house standing in its own grounds, the drainage arrangements were examined in consequence of a death from typhoid fever. Everything was said to he in good order, hut offensive smells had heen at times observed. As the house had formerly heen drained by a brick drain into a cesspool, it was decided to search for the cesspool which was found 130 feet from the house, and had not been emptied. The old brick drain was also discovered, and traeed to within 13 feet of the house, and as the soil was loose, there is no doubt that the sewer gas was drawn along the course of the old drain into the house. The cesspool was emptied and filled up, and the drain dug up for some distance from the house, since which there has not been any smell observable. At a house in De Beauvoir Road offensive smells were complained of in a bedroom. On being inspected the cause at first appeared to be incomprehensible, but on the loft over the room being examined, it was found that the stack pipe instead of being carried outside had been placed in an angle of the wall, and was connected without the intervention of a trap with the drain. The hopper head was in the loft, so that the drain was ventilated directly into the house. At one of the Police stations some cases of diphtheria occurred, but on a search being made a cesspool, covered with a grating, was found in the yard which had been used as a playground by the affected children. It was of considerable depth, and received not only the yard 4 drainage but the waste water from the kitchen sink. As all the rest of the offices were well drained, the existence of this oesspool was not even suspected, much less known, because from the manner of its construction its contents could not be seen through the grating. Another instance was that of a house, the basement of which was flooded after heavy rains, and as the water was clear and not sewage, it was supposed to have been caused by land springs, but drainage of the basement did not make matters any better. Every effort was made to detect the cause, which remained undiscovered until a deep cutting was made along the garden walk of the adjoining house for purposes of drainage, when the owner of the first-named house thought that an examination of the ground might give some clue to the dampness of his house. On looking into the trench he saw that a drain had been cut across, and on putting a stick into each end of the drain, he found that it ran in the direction of his house. This was an old field drain, which still drained the adjoining gardens, and had been cut off close to the footings by the workmen when building the house. This drain was connected with the new drain in his neighbour's garden, when the cure was complete. This is the second instance I have known of dampness in houses being caused by field drains having been cut off instead of being connected with the new drains. Many other nuisances also arose from neglect of workmen. Thus a very offensive smell was noticed in a house in which there had been frequent cases of illness, which was attributed by the medical attendant to sewer gas. The smell was most perceptible in a bedroom, and on taking up the floor boards an open 2-inch leaden pipe was found. On making enquiry it was ascertained that the former tenant had had a bath in the room, and the plumber had simply contented himself when removing the bath with cutting through the pipe, which was directly connected with the soil pipe, instead of properly closing it. In another instance the basement of a house was made quite wet by the supply pipe to a wash-hand basin having been cut off close to the supply pipe of the house, and imperfectly knocked 5 up, instead of having been properly closed. In another house several inches of water were found under the boards, and as the water was clear and the room half under ground was supposed to have been caused by a spring. On pulling down the skirting board the wall was found to be damp, as well as the joist in which the floor boards rested. In making a closer examination the under surface of the joist was found to be wet, although nearly a foot above the level of the water. The adjoining premises were therefore examined, when in a gateway leading to the stables, about 1 foot under ground, a defeotive water supply pipe was found, from which water was continually running. Several of the more common causes of offensive smells have been discovered, many in large houses, during the year. For instance in a clergyman's house, the pupils who used a particular study habitually suffered from headaches, and after a time from low fever. On examination of the house, the drainage arrangements of which were most defective, it was found that there was a covered wash-hand basin in a corner of the room, which was connected with the soil pipe, and as the basin was never used the trap was dry, so that it was practically a ventilator for the soil pipe. The most common causes of offensive smells in houses is the use of bell traps in sinks, when the waste pipes are directly connected with the house drains. Great attention has for some time past been paid in this District to the disconnection of sinks from house drains, especially since the appointment of the third Inspector of nuisances, as more time can be given to this work without neglecting other equally pressing nuisances. Many instances have also come under notice of nuisances arising from defects in adjoining premises. For instance, sewage was found in the cellar of a well-drained house, and as the party wall was damp, and as the closet pipe belonging to the adjoining house was placed against the party wall, some whitewash was poured down the closet, and escaped from the pipe which was found to be defective. Another very frequent cause of the escape of sewer gas 6 into houses in this district is the defective manner in whioh connections have been made between the traps and the drains. It was a by no means uncommon practice for some builders, where a pipe did not quite reach as far as the trap, to connect the pipe and trap with brick work, which the rats displaced, and then got into the houses. In several instances rats have worked under a garden wall, and then under the foundation of the adjoining house into the pantry, and thus afforded a passage for sewer gas from one house to another. Rats have also made their way into houses from the sewer, outside the pipe, in consequence of the eye having been badly put in. I may also mention as an instance of very bad drainage a large house, where all the junctions were at right angles to the main pipes, the pipe from the sink had not been picked up; the waste pipes from the cistern and a wash basin came into an unventilated soil pipe, and were not trapped ; the cesspool had not been emptied when the drain pipes were laid down, and the bend of the outlet was irregular. Considerable difficulty was experienced in having every fault remedied, as the workmen covered the pipes over without doing the work properly, and it was only by having them stripped again, and relaid, that the drainage was carried out efficiently. One of the Inspectors visited the premises more than a dozen times, and I accompanied him on two occasions. The means of drainage and water supply of the houses have been carefully examined in every house where infectious diseases appeared during the year, and all the defects found have been remedied. In almost every instance where diphtheria or typhoid fever occurred, the drainage or water supply arrangements were more or less defective, consisting chiefly of the presence of bell traps instead of efficient traps, and of direct communications between the sinks or the rain-water pipes and the house drains. In abating these nuisances the rain-water pipes are not invariably cut off from the house drains, but only in those instances where the hopper heads are near the windows. 7 TABLE I.

The estimated population of the district on July 1st, 1882, was 195,200, or close upon 200,000, being a very great contrast to the population at the time of my appointment, when it consisted of less than 70,000 persons. The density of population per acre is also rapidly increasing, being now 49.6 for the whole district—that is to say, including the 568 acres of water and open spaces, the greatest part of which are situated on our borders. The number of births still increase, but not in so great a proportion as in former years, whilst the deaths were fewer in 1882 than in 1881, owing to the much smaller number of deaths from infectious diseases, and especially from diarrhoea. The proportion of births to population being less than 1880 and 1879, it is possible that the number of inhabitants is not quite so large as the calculated number. It 8 is, moreover, a fact that the ratio is almost the same as in the census year of 1871, and does not differ largely from the birth rate of last year (1881), so that the calculations cannot be far wrong.

Of course the experience of one year is not to be taken as an absolute check on the population, but if the diminished rate should continue it would lead me to believe that the increase of population in this parish had come to a comparative standstill. There was an increase to a rather greater extent in the Stamford Hill Sub-Registration district, the births having been 349 in 1882 against 330 in 1881 ; whilst in West Hackney there was a decided decrease, as only 1258 births were registered there during the year, against 1291 in 1881; but there was an excess of births in Hackney and South Hackney sub-registration districts, especially in South Hackney, where there were registered 1426 births against 1380 in 1881. The percentages of births to the whole of the births in the District were 12.2 in Stoke Newington, 5.4 in Stamford Hill, 19.6 in "West Hackney, 40.6 in Hackney, and 22.2 in South 9 Hackney, corresponding pretty closely to the percentages of population at the time of the last census.

There are also other reasons, notably that the Hackney subdistrict includes the German Hospital, the Hackney Union Workhouse, the East London Union, the Fever and Small Pox Hospitals and the Asylum Board, and some Lunatic Asylums. It would, therefore, be of little use to distribute the deaths to the sub-districts to which they belong without being fairly certain as to the number of the population on which the deaths should be calculated. The table, however, is useful in shewing the probability of variations in the number of residents in these localities. The number of deaths in Stoke Newington was 379 against 300 in 1881, indicating, together with the births, that the population has not greatly increased there during the year ; whilst the large increase which has taken place in the deaths of Stamford Hill sub-district, viz., 175 against 148 in 1881, would, without the knowledge I have of a large addition to the 10 number of houses, be sufficient to shew that there are manymore residents there than in 1881. In West Hackney there were only 625 deaths in 1882 against 678 in 1881, but this decrease was caused to a great extent by the diminution in this year of deaths from diarrhoea, which disease causes ordinarily more than its fair proportion of deaths in this sub-district. In Hackney sub-district there were fewer deaths than in 1881, viz., 1698 against 1728; whilst in South Hackney there were only 628 deaths against 700 in 1881. TABLE IV.

The total deaths from zymotic diseases (Class 1) were 682 against 928 in 1881, being a very great reduction for the year; but, as might be 11 expected, there was an increase in almost all the other groups. Under the heading of deaths from constitutional affections, chiefly cancer and consumption, there were 688 deaths against 578 in 1881; 1657 deaths from "local diseases,"—that is to say, from affections of the heart, lungs, liver and other organs, against 1593; whilst from developmental diseases, viz., premature birth, atrophy and debility, and old age, there were 378 deaths against 421 in 1881. The mortality from violence was nearly the same as usual, viz., 100 against 94. The deaths from all causes under 1 year of age were 768, or 21.9 per cent. of the whole, against 23.0 in 1881, 24.3 in 1866-75, and 21.0 in 1856-65. The deaths between 1 and 5 years of age numbered 683, or 19.5 per cent. of those at all ages, which was a somewhat smaller percentage than in 1881. At the age period of 5-15 there were 230 deaths, or 6.6 per cent. of the total mortality; at 15-25 there were 150 deaths, or 4.3 per cent; at 25-35 there were 211 deaths, or 6.0 per cent; at 35-45 there were 264 deaths, or 7.5 per cent.; at 45-55 there were 274 deaths, or 7.8 per cent.; at 55-65 years there were 291 deaths, which equal 8.3 per cent.; at 65-75 years of age there were as many as 326 deaths, or 9.3 per cent. of the total mortality. The number of deaths above 75 years of age was large, shewing that a considerable proportion of our inhabitants live to more than 75 years of age, for no less than 308 out of 3508 deaths occurred at the age period of 75 to 100 years, against 286 last year. It seems to me decidedly satisfactory that nearly 9 per cent. of our population live to this great age. The following are the ages at death at above 80 years of age, viz.,—21 at 80-81, 24 at 81-82, 22 at 82-83, 11 at 83-84, 18 at 84-85, 9 at 85-86, 7 at 86-87, 13 at 87-88, 5 at 88-89, 11 at 89-90, 5 at 90-91, 5 at 91-92, 6 at 92-93, 2 at 94-95, 1 at 96-97, and two above 100 years of age. I enquired into these two deaths and have reason to believe that the return was correct. The percentages of deaths from the zymotic class was 19.5 per cent. of all the deaths; from constitutional affections, 19.6 per cent; from diseases as affecting special 12 organs, termed local diseases, 47.2 per cent.; from developmental diseases, including old age, and premature birth and debility, 10.8 per cent.; whilst deaths from violence amounted to 2.9 per cent. of the deaths from all causes.

The deaths returned in the Zymotic class for this table are not so numerous as in the former table, because deaths in order 1 of this class only are included. As before mentioned these deaths were considerably fewer than in 1881, although in proportion to the population they were nearly the same as in 1880, but were less than in 1879. The last named, however, was a year in which deaths from these diseases were less numerous than for many preceding years. The mortality from tubercular affections, and pulmonary diseases, except phthisis, which are included amongst tubercular, was higher than in 1880 and 1881, which is usually the case when zymotic diseases are less fatal than usual, as they were in 1882. Convulsive diseases of infants, which include hydrocephalus and meningitis 13 occurring in infants, convulsions and teething, as well as wasting diseases of children under 1 year, were much below the average.

Under the word fever is included several different diseases, viz., typhus, typhoid or enteric fever, and simple continued or ill-defined fever. As regards typhus it is a very rare disease in Hackney, as only one death occurred in the district, but how it was caused I could not ascertain, as I knew nothing of the case until after the patient's death. The deaths from small pox were very few, viz., 13 against 225 in 1881; but although they exceeded the number registered in 1873, 74, 75 and 79, they were much below the average for the 10 years which was as high as 79, chiefly owing to the two epidemics of 1877 and 1881. Measles also was less fatal than usual, as 43 deaths were registered against 149 in 1881, and an average of 60 for the last 10 years. Scarlet fever on the contrary was very prevalent, as 144 deaths were registered against the annual number of 76 for the 10 years, and of 118 in 1881. Diphtheria was also very fatal, as 51 deaths were recorded against a mean of 22 for the 10 years, and of 61 in 1881. Whooping cough caused by far the largest number of deaths amongst this group of diseases, viz., 182 against 70 in 1881, and a mean for the 10 years of 97. The mortality from fever was nearly the same as in 1881, having been 63 against 64, whilst that from diarrhoea was unusually small, having been only 99 against 135 in 1881, and 170 in 1880. The mean number of deaths per 10,000 population in 1882, from these diseases, was 31.02 against 32.7 in 1872-81. The death rate from small pox was only 0.66 per 10,000 in 1882, against 2.20 from measles, 7.88 from scarlet fever, 2.61 from diphtheria, 9.32 from whooping cough, 323 from fever, and 5.12 from diarrhœa. These figures are very satisfactory, as if whooping cough were subtracted, the deaths from the other six diseases were less than 2.2 per 1000 population. The death rate from these diseases was much lower than that for all London. 15 TABLE VII.

During the 10 years, 1841-50, the mean annual number of births was 1,398, and of deaths 946; in 1861-70, the mean annual number of births was 3,440, and of deaths, 2,182; and in 1882 there were 6,423 births to 3,505 deaths registered 16 in the district. The birth rate as compared with the death rate has, with a few exceptions, kept continually increasing sinoe 1841, shewing that, as oompared with the rest of the population, the number of married women at child-bearing ages has increased very considerably since that year. In 1841-50 there were 148 births to 100 deaths; in 1851-60, there were 159 births to each 100 deaths; in 1861-70, there were 157 births to 100 deaths; in 1871-80, there were 178 births to the same number of deaths; and in 1882 as many as 183 births to 100 deaths. The death rate per 1000 population has remained nearly the same during the whole of this period, so that the increased ratio of births to deaths has not been caused to any marked extent by variations in the death rates. The very slight excess of deaths pro rata to population since 1841-50, is very satisfactory indeed, because not only has the density of population increased, but there were fewer servants in proportion to population in 1871-80 than in 1841-50, and a much poorer class of residents. On the other hand the sanitary arrangements are better now than they have ever been, and the number of children and young persons amongst the population has certainly increased, although the proportion of servants has diminished. The deaths of infants under 1 year old in proportion to total births was satisfactory, as there were only 119 out of each 1000 births against 162 for all London, and 142 for Hackney during the 10 years, 1871-80. This very small death rate of infants arises to a great extent from the diminution in the mortality from small pox, measles and diarrhoea, but against this there was a great excess in the number of deaths from whooping cough, viz., 60 in 1882, against 23 in 1881. This makes the low death rate under 1 year all the more satisfactory. The death rate per 1000 population was singularly low, having been only 17.9 against 21.4 for all London, and is smallest I have recorded since my appointment, the next lowest, 18.3 having occurred in 1880. These figures are the 17 more satisfactory as they happened in the year before and the year after the census of 1881, so that the calculated population could not be far wrong in either year. Indeed, if the census had been taken some years since I should have thought that my calculated population was much too high, and the assumed death rate consequently too low; but under the circumstance s the error, if any, from this cause cannot be large. The proportion of deaths from the seven chief zymotic diseases in Hackney was small, viz., 3.10 per 1000 inhabitants against 38.3 for all London, and 2.39 for all England; the mean in Hackney for the 10 years, 1871-80, having been 3.40 per 1000. I may mention here that I have made what I consider to be a full allowance for deaths in hospitals by retaining all the deaths in the German Hospital, the Lunatic Asylums, in the River Lea, and of inhabitants of this district in the Asylum's Boards Hospitals, especially as from the social position of our population we cannot have so large a proportion of deaths in hospitals as occurs for all London. The number of small pox cases reported to me this year was very small as compared with 1881, there having been only 79 against 1146 in the last-named year; and of these 50 occurred in small houses, and 29 in better class houses—to a great extent amongst servants and other employes. There were several cases in the vicinity of the hospital, and especially in Clifden road, where 3 cases occurred, as well as 2 in Brooksby's Walk, 1 in College street, and 1 in Nesbitt street. The small pox cases were treated in wards situated at the back of the hospital, nearer to Clifden road than to any of the other streets and places where the disease has hitherto been so prevalent. The source of infection could not be ascertained in any case, although particular enquiries were made. One of the persons attacked had, however, come to reside in Clifden road rather less than three weeks before the disease manifested itself. There were not any other cases of zymotic disease in Clifden road, although the Fever Hospital is within a very short distance from the houses on one side of the road, and the 18 disease was very prevalent in many other parts of the district. Indeed, there were more cases of scarlet fever reported to me than of small pox, diphtheria, typhoid fever, and simple continued or other ill-defined fevers put altogether, as there were 459 cases of scarlet fever, 79 of small pox, 76 of diphtheria, 124 of typhoid fever, and 7 of other fevers. There were also but few cases of zymotic diseases in the neighbourhood of the hospital, viz., about 1 per 1000 population of scarlet fever withiu a quarter-mile radius, against 2.5 per 1000 for the whole district; and 0.8 cases of typhoid fever within the quarter-mile radius, against 0.6 for the whole district. There were 57 deaths from typhoid fever in the whole district against 124 cases reported, so that there must have been more than 0.6 cases per 1000 population. As a far larger proportion of the cases of small pox, which occur within the quarter-mile radius, are removed to the hospital than amongst the population generally, and as I do not get a large number of private cases reported to me, I should say that in proportion to population there were at least quite as many cases outside the quarter-mile radius as within it. At the same time it must not be forgotten that the disease has not been epidemic during the year, so that the epidemic influence, as it is termed, has been absent; that the number of cases treated in the hospital has been very limited ; and well within the number which has hitherto, apparently, been innocuous to the neighbourhood. In the early part of November a severe outbreak of diarrhoea occurred at Clapton Common, and the upper part of Stamford Hill, the disease attacking the inmates of most of the houses (which are of a good class) between the 3rd and 6th of the month. I cannot state the precise number attacked, as the medical practitioner who gave me the information thought that a house-to-house visitation would not be of any practical assistance, and might prove injurious by increasing the existing alarm. The outbreak was so sudden and general that it clearly arose from some common cause—that is to say, from polluted milk or water, or from sewer gas. The time of year and the 19 absence of smell from the sewers were against the latter supposition. A little enquiry as to the milk supply shewed that the inhabitants received their milk from several dealers, who obtained it from different sources. There only remained the water supply, but the puzzling part was the simultaneous outbreak at Stamford Hill and at Clapton Common. I immediately wrote to the Engineer of the East London Water Company, requesting him to have the Clapton main scoured out, which was done in less than 24 hours. As I was informed that a sample of the water had been drawn from a supply pipe in a house direct from the main, and sent to Mr. Wigner for analysis, and as I could not readily obtain another sample, I examined the water at the Town Hall, but did not find anything unusual in it. The analysis by Mr. Wigner shewed a slight excess of ammonia and of organic matter, as well as some mycelium, small fibres and animalculæ in the first sample sent; and the absence of anything unusual in the second, which was taken after the main had been flushed. As several fresh cases occurred the day after the main was scoured, I requested it to be flushed a second time, which was done, when the outbreak ceased as rapidly as it had occurred. The cases happened amongst those only, at least so far as I could ascertain, who drank unboiled water, and several visitors who partook of luncheon on the 3rd at Clapton, and drank water, were attacked with the disease on their return home, whilst two visitors who drank sherry at luncheon on the same day escaped an attack. I would mention that I am indebted to Mr. Hanbury for a copy of Mr. Wigner's analyses. As the evidence of the outbreak being due to some local pollution of the water supply was so strong, I went to the Company's offices at St. Helen's Place, where I was shewn the position of the water mains at Clapton and Stamford Hill. I then found that the main at the top of Clapton Common terminated in a blind end, in which there was not any plug or valve, so that the water in it beyond the supply pipes had become "dead," and in my opinion allowed of the growth of 20 mycelium and other organic bodies (small fibres seen by Mr. Wigner) which had caused the outbreak. I also ascertained that there was a cross main leading to the main supplying Stamford Hill, which accounted for the simultaneous occurrence of diarrhoea at this part of the district. The cases occurred at the part of the Hill above the junction of the cross main, and in the line of direction taken by the water supply. Cases also occurred in streets adjacent to Clapton Common and Stamford Hill, but in a comparatively few instances only. I was informed by a medical practitioner who drank some unboiled water, that he suffered a good deal from abdominal pain, as well as from diarrhoea. He also felt a considerable amount of prostration, and had no doubt that it was caused by the water supply. The failure of a chemical analysis to account for the outbreak (as both samples of water would have been considered as fairly good) shews that too much reliance ought not to be placed on a chemical examination, but that in all cases microscopical examination should also be made. In this instance it revealed the presence of some organisms, which are indicative of what is termed a " doubtful water." It is not possible in the present state of chemical and microscopical knowledge to say that a given sample of water is absolutely harmless, probably because the state in which organic matter exists in water is more important than the absolute amount. I mean that when organic matter is undergoing change and breaking up into simpler compounds, or acts as a pabulum for the growth of the lower forms of life, a very small quantity is likely to be injurious, whilst a large amount in another condition may he quite harmless. The inability of chemists to distinguish between water containing a small portion of the stool of a typhoid patient, from that containing an equal proportion of a stool from a healthy person, was shewn by experiments carried out under the supervision of Dr. Cory, on behalf of the Local Government Board. Further, the chemical analysis of a sample of water containing one grain of enteric fever stool per gallon, which is a most dangerous amount, would be scarcely 21 appreciable by the chemist, who, although he may be able to point out waters which are hazardous, cannot say in all cases that a particular water may be used with perfeot safety. Although most of the bakehouses in the district have been visited every year, yet a systematic inspection of the whole during a number of consecutive days has not been made since the Bakehouse Regulation Act was repealed until this year. As there are 146 bakehouses in the district, and they are scattered all over it, an inspection of the whole was made, and occupied some time. It was carried out without opposition on the part of the bakers, when they were informed that entry was demanded under the provisions of the Sanitary Act, and not under those of the Factory Act. As many as 93 bakehouses were found to be in good order, and in a cleanly state, but the following objectionable arrangements were met with, viz., in two there were untrapped drain openings in the floor of the bakehouses; in 21 there were bell traps, several of which were dry, so that there might as well have been no trap at all; and in two other instances there were unventilated wateT closets which opened into the bakehouses—one of these had been recently erected. In addition, 26 required limewhiting and cleansing. The whole of the defects were removed under the notices served on the occupiers to our satisfaction, yard gullies being substituted for bell traps; the two water closets being properly lighted and ventilated, and separated by a double door from the bakehouse. The limewhiting and cleansing were also speedily attended to. A bed and bedding was found in one bakehouse instead of in a separate room, but over this objectionable arrangement we have no control. I may say in conclusion that there has not been any difficulty in obtaining the abatement of any nuisances which have been found in the bakehouses of this district. About the middle of the year complaints were made to me respecting the foul state of the Lea, which, it was alleged, arose from imperfectly purified sewage being poured into the river at Tottenham. I made enquiries into the matter, and inspected 22 the river more than once, when I found it in an unsatisfactory state. I communicated with the Clerk to the Lea Conservancy Board, who promised that due attention should he given to the matter, and since that time I have not received any more complaints. I have also continued my occasional inspections of the Ambulance Station, London Fields, and was quite satisfied with the manner in which the Ambulances were kept, and the general arrangements, including disinfection, were carried out. I consider the conveyances and mode of removal to be attended with less risk to the public health than the old system of each parish removing their own sick. There has also been an entire immunity from small pox in the immediate neighbourhood of this station since its establishment. During the year several persons have called on me respecting the newly establishing of offensive trades, and I have in all instances informed them that if the trade should prove offensive to the neighbourhood in which it was carried on, legal proceedings would be taken, and in no instance was the premises fitted up for the purpose. I have received complaints respecting some offensive trades which were earned on in the district, and succeeded in abating the nuisance in all cases without the necessity of taking summonses against the occupiers of the premises. In one which consisted in the manufacture of waterproof cloth, the proprietor asked for time to finish a large order which he had in hand, which was given him by the Sanitary Committee, and at the expiration of the time allowed, he removed his business to another parish. Another person who boiled oil for making printing ink has discontinued the process; and a third, who kept a very large quantity of rags on his premises, and sorted them in the open air, has removed out of the district, in consequence of the notices served upon them. I think it a matter of congratidation that we have so very few premises in this district upon which these trades are carried on, but the inhabitants are sometimes annoyed by offensive smells which are given off by manufacturers in an 23 adjoining parish, and from the Gas Works at Haggerston, but the last-named are not so much complained of as they were. The whole of the cow-sheds in the district, amounting to 61, and many of the slaughter-houses were inspected by the View Committee, and I visited a considerable proportion of them on more than one occasion. They were generally in a fair condition, but above 30 notices were served for repair of paving, new traps, cleansing and lime-whiting the sheds, nearly all of which were complied with. It was, however, necesssary to oppose the renewal of the license to a butcher for not properly paving and draining his yard, and to a cowkeeper for refusing to alter his grain pit in such a manner as to prevent the effluvia from tainting the air of the cowshed. Also another cowkeeper for not properly paving his yard and part of the shed, and not using proper means for preventing the offensive vapours from the dung-pit entering the shed; and a third cowkeeper for not providing sufficient ventilation to the shed, and proper paving for the yard. The renewal of these licenses was adjourned at the October to the November Sessions, when the butcher and one cowkeeper were warned that they would lose their licenses if they did not keep their premises in a more cleanly state, and as the others had complied with our requirements all the licenses were granted. During the year I have attended 49 Committee Meetings, viz., 27 of the Sanitary Committee, 9 of the View Committee, chiefly for the inspection and re-inspection of the cow-sheds and slaughter-houses; 4 of the Trap Committee, which was appointed by the Board to report as to the most efficient trap for the street gullies; 6 of the Mortuary Committee, and 3 meetings of other Committees unconnected with Sanitary work. In addition to these I attended at the Sessions House, Great Prescott Street, to oppose the renewal of the licenses to those occupiers of cow-sheds and slaughter-houses who had neglected to carry out the orders of the Sanitary Committee, as well as on several occasions at the Police Courts, to give evidence against 24 the owners of property who had neglected or refused to abate the nuisances existing on their premises. I have also attended on two occasions before the Royal Commissioners on Hospitals for Infectious Diseases, to give evidence, and submit statistics as to the effects of the Homerton Hospital on the health of the adjoining neighbourhood, as well as of the Ambulances and Ambulance Station of the Asylums Board at London Fields. My evidence was rather voluminous, and is noticed in many portions of their report, as no less than 31 of my statements or answers to questions are referred to in it. The report of the Commissioners as to the future management of these hospitals, contain recommendations which, if carried out, will materially limit the number of small-pox patients treated in the Metropolitan Hospitals. The number of nuisances abated during the year was very large, as no less than 2,951 bell traps were removed, and the same number of more efficient traps, chiefly yard gullies, were substituted. There have been also 1,474 sinks cut off from the drains, and 1,446 stack pipes disconnected. These latter have been cut off from direct communication with the drains when they were placed near to windows, and were therefore likely to prove injurious to the health of the inmates of the houses. In many cases the only objectionable arrangements connected with the water supply or drainage in houses where typhoid fever or diphtheria had occurred, was the existence of hopper-heads near the bedroom windows. There were 355 choked drains cleansed and repaired or re-laid; 199 damp yards drained; and 202 choked water-closet pans released. In addition to these there were 1575 yards in which the paving was repaired or new paving provided; 435 dust-bins repaired or new ones supplied ; and 1,477 houses whitewashed, cleansed and repaired. As a large number of the small houses in the district were and are not even now supplied with water for the closets, a large number of notices have been served on the owners during the year, where a constant supply has been given, to provide a proper water supply and apparatus for flushing the closets, 25 which has been done in a very large number of instances, as 755 flushing boxes (water waste preventers) were fixed in the closets, and as regards 1,035 other closets, either a new water-supply apparatus was provided, or repairs of the old carried out so as to make them efficient. In addition to these 1,790 improvements in the apparatus for the supply of water closets, as many as 591 lengths of pipe with screw-down taps were supplied by owners to enable the occupiers to obtain their water supply direct from the service pipe, instead of from the cistern. I attach much importance to this arrangement, as it enables the occupants of houses to obtain water uncontaminated by deposits in the cisterns, or from cisterns which are in connection with water closets. The total number of houses in which improvements as regards water supply or the means of flushing closets have been effected is, therefore, as many as 2,381, which I consider to be satisfactory. There is still a number of houses in which means of drainage and the watersupply arrangements are not so good as they should be ; but as all newly-built houses are inspected, under the Surveyor's directions, by some of his staff, both as regards means of drainage and water supply, I trust, before long, all nuisances of this kind will be removed, although those arising from bad use and ordinary wear and tear of the fittings, traps, &c., will always give a considerable amount of work to this department. An inspection was made of 24 public schools, partly those of the London School Board, and in most of these the drainage arrangements were defective, although in the lately-built schools the provision of flushing tanks, improved traps, and better means of ventilating the drains have rendered them much more healthy than the old schools. The number of notices served for the removal of nuisances was very large, viz., 9,325, but the number of persons summoned was smaller than usual, for including tho persons who had to appear before a magistrate for selling adulterated articles, the total was only 44. The number of houses inspected under the Sanitary Act, 1860, was 4,227, and of premises inspected in consequence of complaints, 812, or 26 less than one.sixth of the whole. The number of houses in which nuisances were found amongst the 4,227 inspected under the Sanitary Act was 3,034, shewing the absolute necessity for a periodical inspection of this class of houses. There were 16,804 rooms in the 4,227 houses, all of which were examined, as well as the yards, water.closets, water.supply apparatus, and the means of drainage, including the traps, the sinks, and rainwater pipe connections. The number of families was 5,921, and of inmates, 26,067, being at the rate of 1*4 families and nearly 6.2 persons to each house. The number of cases of zymotic disease reported to me from these houses during the year was as follows, viz., 50 of small pox, 305 of scarlet fever, 46 of diphtheria, 96 of typhoid fever, and 4 of other kinds of fever, including 2 of typhus, one of which occurred in the person of an employee of the Fever Hospital, and the other was apparently an imported case, as the house was clean, free from smell, well drained, not overcrowded, and the sick person was not in want of ordinary necessaries. The total number of cases of zymotic disease, excluding measles, whooping cough and diarrhoea, brought to my notice during the year, was 79 of small pox, 459 of scarlet fever, 76 of diphtheria, 124 of typhoid fever, and 7 of other fevers. These figures include those who died as well as those who recovered. Articles Disinfected for the Years 1878 to 1882. ' Years. Beds. Mattrasses. Palliasses. Bolsters. Pillows. Blankets. Sheets.

The outlay for the disinfection was as follows:—For wages of the men, £114 8s. 0d.; for disinfectants, £62 9s. 3d.; for coals and coke, £3 12s. 7d.; for a hand truck, £5 5s. 0d.; and for various other expenses, £12 13s. 9d.—making a total of £198 8s. 7d. The whole of this amount is strictly not chargeable to the disinfection of premises, as the whole of the disinfectants used for the gullies and for disinfecting offensive matters moved from the gullies is charged to this account. The sum received from persons able to pay was unusually small, as most of the houses in which infectious diseases occurred in 1882 were occupied by the poorer classes. The removal of dust during the year has been very satisfactorily performed, as the contractors have made no difficulty about supplying the number of carts, horses and men required, and the dust inspector has carefully superintended all the men employed, and seen that they went into the different streets on the assigned days, so that only 1,240 requests to remove dust have been received here during the year. Now considering the very large number of houses in the district this is a very small number, especially when we consider that no less than 22,250 loads of dust were removed at a total cost of £2,860 10s. 0d., or for 2/7¼ for each load of 60 cubic feet. The weather during the year was somewhat remarkable, having been, almost without exception, unusually warm during the first five months; mostly cold and unseasonable during June, July, August and September; and very variable during the remainder of the year. The month of January was mild, having a mean temperature of 40.4, which is more than two degrees above the average of the preceding 41 years, with less rain than usual, and a comparative absence of north and northeast winds. February resembled January very closely, and was 28 unusually warm, except for the first 11 days, the mean temperature of the month being nearly 2½ degrees above the average. March was mild and pleasant, with a mean temperature of 46 degrees, which was nearly 4½ degrees above the average of 41 years; indeed, there have been only 4 instances since 1771 of so high a mean temperature for March. As regards the death.rate for this quarter, the Registrar.General stated that for all England there had not been so low a death. rate since the civil registration of deaths was established in 1837, but that in London it was in excess for the time of year, viz., 25.6 per 1,000, owing to dense fogs and the prevalence of whooping.cough. 1n Hackney the annual death.rate was 222 per 1,000 during the quarter, and was as high as 30'8 during one fortnight, owing to the dense fogs. 1n April the weather was warm and rainy, with S., S.W. and W. winds, but the mean temperature was only a little in excess, owing to a short snap of cold weather at the end of the month. May was warm and dry, the temperature having been nearly 2 degrees in excess, and the rain nearly three.quarters of an inch in defect. June had a mean temperature which was nearly 2½ degrees in defect, with less rain than usual. 1n all London the death.rate was 20.9 per 1,000, whilst that of Hackney was only 15.8 per 1,000 population, having been as low as 13.2 for the fortnight ending June 24th. July had a mean temperature of 60.4 degrees, which was 1.8 degrees below the average, whilst August was cooler still, the mean temperature having been only 59.6 degrees, which was 1.9 degrees below the average, and September shewed a greater departure from the mean even than the other months, as the mean temperature was only 54 3 degrees, or 2.8 degrees below the average. There was a deficiency of rain in each month, amounting to 1.41 inches during the quarter, August being unusually dry. The death. rate in all London was only 18.6 per 1,000 population, chiefly owing to the comparatively small number of deaths from diarrhoea. 1n Hackney the death.rate was only 13.3 per 1,000, having been as low as 11.3 for the fortnight ending July 15th. 29 The mean temperature for October was 50.8 degrees, which was nearly 1 degree above the average, whilst that for November was 43.5 degrees, or precisely an average. December had a mean of 40.1 degrees, which was slightly in excess. Snow fell in London on the 24th of October, and there were occasional slight falls of snow in the first fortnight in December, the total rainfall in October being 5.42 inches, or more than 2½ inches in excess, 2.19 inches in November, and 1.78 inches in December, which was about one-fifth of an inch in the two last-named months in defect of the mean. The death-rate for the quarter in London was less than usual for the three months, having been 21.8 per 1,000, and in Hackney it was still less, having been only 18'8 per 1,000. The mean temperatures just given are those for Greenwich, as there is not a sufficiently long series of observations made here for purposes of comparison.
