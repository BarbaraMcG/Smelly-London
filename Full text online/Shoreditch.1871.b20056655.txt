Published pursuant to the ''Metropolis Local Management Act," 1855. N.B.— The Medical Officer's and Sanitary Reports will be issued separately. REPORT OF THE VESTRY CLERK. Gentlemen, During the year ending Lady-day, 1872, the amount collected by the Poor's Rate was £83,742 18s. 8d.; the amount in the pound levied for the four quarters was 4s. 1d., being for the quarter to Midsummer, 1871, 1s. 2d., to Michaelmas, 1s. 1d., to Christmas, 10d., and to Lady-day, 1872, 1s. The gross amount levied was £91,075, from which has to be deducted losses from defaulters, excused, vacant premises, and allowances to owners, equal in all to about 13 per cent. of the gross sum charged. The £83,742 18s. 8d. collected has been expended thus: Balance due to Treasurer, Lady-day, 1871 851 14 2 Paid to Guardians for calls 57500 0 0 Police Rate 12530 5 6 County and Lunatics Rate 5994 4 9 Parliamentary Voters Registration, Returning Officers charge, and Jury List 480 6 5 Law Expenses, Appeals, &c. 1354 8 6 Collectors' Poundage 1298 17 4 Burial Board 110 5 0 Election of Vestrymen 68 0 6 Rates, Brokers, Stamps, &c. 294 14 6 £83,742 18 8 At Lady-day, 1871, the Vestry was indebted to the Guardians on Contribution Orders £11,000, and at the same period, 1872, £13,500. 6 The amount of the Guardians Contribution Orders for the year ending Lady-day, 1871, was £51,000, and for the year ending Ladyday, 1872, £60,000. Further particulars will be found in the Balance Sheet given with the Accountant's report. SEWERS AND GENERAL RATES. The Accountant's statement hereto appended will give the details of the receipts and expenditure on account of the Sewers and General Rates. It is only necessary here to state that the rates levied for the last two years, were 1871. 1872. General in the £ 1/9 1/5 Sewers ditto 4d. 4d. It may be mentioned here that in January last a collision occurred between the Guardians and the Vestry. The former make orders on the latter for payment and the Vestry is bound to raise the money by Poor Rates. Owing to the Vestry having had, during December, to pay about £7500 for Police and County Rates, the payments to the Guardians fell into arrears, and the sum of £13,500 was then due to the Guardians. Proceedings were taken by the latter body at Worship Street Police Court against the Vestry to recover the arrears. Counsel appeared on both sides and after some argument, in which the Vestry stated the cause of its difficulties, and promised to discharge its then liabilities by the 9th of March, the summons was dismissed by oonsent. The arrears were paid by the 9th of March, but £9000 was then owing, and a third instalment was accruing. The calls by the Guardians were then heavy, but this state of embarrassment must always occur every six months when the Police rates have to be paid, unless the Vestry makes provision by ceasing to calculate outstanding rates as available for current payments. ASSESSMENTS. The Provisional and Supplemental Valuation Lists for the year have been duly prepared. One case only requires special mention, the Workhouse of St. Luke, though situate in the parish of Shoreditch, has from its establishment been virtually exempt from Assessment. The Local Act of St. Luke's provided that so long as it was used as a 7 house for the Poor of St. Luke's it should not be assessed at a higher value than the property was assessed at previous to its being so applied, i.e., £19. In 1849 the Trustees of the Poor of this Parish sought to set aside this exemption, but the Queen's Bench decided that the Workhouse was by the Local Act not liable to assessment to a greater extent than the £19. In 1868 the Parish of St. Luke was joined to the Holborn Union for Poor Law purposes, and the occupation of the Workhouse passed to the Guardians of the Union, in addition to which the Holborn Guardians had erected a building at a cost of about £13,000 on the land. As the exemption by statute applied to the Guardians of St. Luke only, it was contended that it could not apply to the Guardians of the Holborn Union, and the premises were assessed at £1800 gross and £1200 nett value. The Holborn Guardians appealed primarily to the Assessment Committee and subsequently it was agreed between the two parties to submit the matter in a Special case to the Queen's Bench. At a period subsequent to Lady-day, 1872, the matter came before the Court for argument, and it then transpiring that the Guardians of the Holborn Union paid to the Parish of St. Luke a rental for the use of the premises, it was held unanimously by the Judges that the exemption ceased. No formal decision was given, it being left to the Holborn Guardians to withdraw or amend the case, with an intimation that the case if amended must be decided in favour of Shoreditch. The assessment is therefore virtually confirmed. THE SMALL POX EPIDEMIC. This disease which had raged with great violence in this parish during the Autumn and Winter of 1870-71, so far subsided as to allow of the temporary Hospital to be closed in May. The total cost of the Hospital, including Building and Furniture, Medical Attendance, Nursing, Provisions, Removal of patients to Convalescent Homes, &c., was £1317 1s. 6d., from which may be deducted Fees for admission of patients £64 16 6 Sale of old building, &c. 62 0 0 Nett cost £1196 5 0 It is only due to state that Dr. Sutton neither asked for or received any extra remuneration for the arduous duties imposed upon him by this visitation. 8 LOCAL IMPROVEMENTS. HUNTINGDON STREET. The widening of this street, the particulars of which were reported last year, has been practically effected. The street is now widened to an average of 40-feet; the cost of the land was £4415 10s., the Metropolitan Board agreed to contribute one half, and have paid £1000 on account; two-thirds of the amount have been paid to the Freeholder. There now remains one-third or £1471 16s. 8d. to be paid by the Vestry, and £1207 15s. to be received from the Metropolitan Board. THE SHEPHERDESS WALK IMPROVEMENT. This work has at length been completed; all the projections have been removed and the paving finished. The remaining £100 of the £2500 which the Metropolitan Board agreed to pay for the paving of the road, has been received and paid to the Contractor, and the whole affair has been completed. SUSANNAH ROW. The desirability of widening this thoroughfare was considered by the Improvement Committee before it was decided by the Metropolitan Board to ask power for the construction of a New Street from Old Street to Pitfield Street, and as the matter would not allow of delay, an arrangement was made between the Vestry and the lessees, with the approval of the Metropolitan Board, to set back the line of building for a consideration of £300. The Metropolitan Board agreed to contribute one-half, but the amount has not been received from the Board, as the works are not yet quite complete. The lessees have been paid by the Vestry. LUKE STREET. An Agreement has been made with the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to effect an improvement in the vicinity of Luke Street and John Street, between Paul Street and Curtain Road. No money payments have been made, but a mutual concession of land has been arranged, and the Vestry will construct the sewers and make up the roads as required. Luke Street will be extended into Charles Street, a thoroughfare made from New North Place to Luke Street, where there will be an open space reserved, and a small court, which was a great nuisance, will be abolished. 9 METROPOLITAN IMPROVEMENTS. The Bill promoted in the last Session of Parliament by the Metropolitan Board of Works for the widening of High Street, Shoreditch, having been rejected by a partisan Committee, the Vestry again in the Antumn memorialized the Board to introduce a Bill for the same purpose and also for the formation of a New Street from Shoreditch to Old Street in continuation of Commercial Street. Several other Vestries made similar requests, the most important of which, in respect to this locality, were for a New Street from Shoreditch to Bethnal Green and the continuation of Old Street to Oxford Street. A Bill embodying these proposals was introduced into Parliament, and though strenuously opposed at every step by several Vestries and Boards, chiefly suburban, has hitherto made satisfactory progress and gives every promise of becoming law this session.* The parishes of Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, St. Luke's, Clerkenwell, Holborn, &c., have reason to be satisfied with the course the Metropolitan Board has taken and the triumph which has been obtained over the selfish policy advocated by several favored and wealthy parishes. The improvements though within or adjacent to the above parishes, will be for the benefit of the Metropolis at large. TRAMWAYS. Nothing new has been promoted in respect of Tramways in Shoreditch during the past year; but the works for which Parliamentary powers were obtained in the previous session have been commenced and are in active progress from Stamford Hill to Shoreditch, and will be ultimately extended through Hackney Road, Old Street, East Road, and New North Road. The Vestry have entered into an agreement with the Tramway Company in respect to the paving of Old Street, in front of the Town Hall, with Asphalte. The work has been executed by the Val de Travers Company with compressed Asphalte, at a cost of about £1400, of which the Tramway Company will pay about £600. PRIVATE BILL LEGISLATION. Only one Bill was introduced this Session relating directly to this, parish, viz.: The London and North Western Extension of Goods * The Bill has since passed Royal Assent, August 6th. 10 Station between Eldon Street and Worship Street. One of the objects of the Bill was the diversion of that portion of Finsbury Avenue between Sun Street and Eldon Street further westward, this the Company proposed to make but 15-feet wide; the Vestry opposed, and insisted upon a wider thoroughfare not less than 20-feet. The question was heard by the Commons Committee, and the terms offered to the Vestry not being satisfactory, the Bill was with the assistance of the Metropolitan Board opposed in the Lords, and the Vestry were successful in obtaining a minimum width of 20-feet with other protective clauses. THE THREATENED STOPPAGE OF SUN STREET. This is a question which will materially affect Shoreditch, though the exact point of intersection by the Railway is on the City of London. The Corporation of London introduced a Bill into Parliament to remove the doubts as to the alleged power to stop up the street, and to provide that it should be kept open, but the House of Lords Committee threw out the Bill on the ground that as the Corporation had already appealed to the Court of Equity it could not avail itself of two remedies concurrently. The existence of the alleged power to close this street, affords a striking instance of the unsatisfactory character of Private Bill Legislation, and as it is a matter of considerable importance to the parish, the following statement prepared for circulation among Members of Parliament, &c. may not be without interest. "In 1864, the Great Eastern Company obtained an Act to make the City Extension from Shoreditch to Liverpool Street by a viaduct to cross over Sun Street; and the deposited plans show that the level of Street was to remain unaltered, and the street was to be spanned by a bridge 35 feet wide and 16 feet high, this being a great arterial thoroughfare with about 130 vehicles per hour passing through. "The preamble states that it "is expedient that the Company should be authorised to acquire all the Lands and Buildings in the City of London comprised within an area bounded, fas described) and to stop up all streets and highways within the said area, and to appropriate the site of such area to the purposes of a Railway Station." Sun Street bisects this area. 11 "Section 6 recites that plans showing the lines and levels, &c., have been deposited, and enacts that, subject to the powers of deviation contained in the Act, the said Railway shall be made upon the lands so described, and according to the levels defined, "and it shall be lawful for the Company to enter upon, take, and use all or any of the said lands, except as hereinaftermentioned (not applicable), which they may require for the purposes thereof," &c. "By Section 8 it is enacted that "the Company may stop up and cause to be discontinued as public highways, all streets and highways within the area herein-before described, as the site of the intended station, and may appropriate the site of such streets and highways to the purposes of such station," certain places excepted. "Except that Sun Street is mentioned as dividing tho line in two sections, for construction at different times, no other reference to it is made in the Act. It is, however, significant that while the plans show Sun Street to be kept open, they show other narrow and unimportant places to be stopped up. "It is clear, therefore, that under this Act, Sun Street was not intended to be appropriated but arched over. "Capital could not be raised, and the Works did not proceed, and in 1870 the Company obtained an Act, the main object of which was to alter the character of the line from a high to a low level, and the deposited plans showed that the level of the rails was to be 18-ft. 6-in. below the surface of the street, instead of above, but this Act confers no additional power upon the Company to take lands beyond extending the area, and the extended area includes but a few feet of the footway of a portion of Sun Street, just sufficient to enable the Company to deal with the vaults under the footway. The Act is silent as to stopping up Sun Street, though it mentions by name a few small streets and courts in Bethnal Green, &c. "The Terminal Station is to be constructed and the appropriation of Sun Street is to be within the City of London, but there is not, beyond as to payment of rates and lighting of arches, a 12 single saving clause for the City ! ! But section 94 of the first Act, and 52 of the latter, provide that nothing in these Acts shall exempt the railways of the Company from the General Act. "The General Railway Clauses Act, 1845, sec. 13, provides, that arches or tunnels as shewn on plans shall be made accordingly; and sees. 53 to 56 provide, that if it is neccessary to interrupt a road by the constructon of a railway, the Company shall first construct a temporary road, and if the original cannot be restored, the Company shall substitute a permanent road, as convenient as the original. "Under these powers the Company now claim the right to stop up and appropriate the site of Sun Street one of the main arteries of London, for which they offer no substitute whatever! ! "Upon an application by the City of London, Vice-Chancellor Bacon granted an injunction to restrain the Company, holding that the plans must be considered as explanatory of the Act, and that there were no powers to stop up Sun Street. "The Company appealed to the Lord Justices, who have decided the contrary; they admit that the plans may have deceived the parties affected, but they do not govern the powers of the Special Act which overrides the General Act, and Lord Justice James said he wished he could have bound the Company by the plans, but he could not. "The Company therefore, through an accident, if nothing worse, have acquired extraordinary powers, and intend to inflict upon the metropolis, an enormous injury, which it would cost a quarter of a million to partially remedy, and although there is an appeal to the House of Lords with doubtful result, there is nothing to prevent the Company from proceeding forthwith, which probably, unless Parliament interferes, they will speedily do." 13 THE PROPOSED MORTUARY. \ No definite step has been taken towards the providing of a Mortuary, but negociations are in progress with the North London Railway Company which it is expected will result in placing a convenient site at the disposal of the Vestry, upon which a building with all requisites can be erected. THE TOWN HALL. During the year the large hall has been let 146 times, and the Council Chamber 27 times. The Committee Rooms have been frequently used by the Local Committee of the London School Board, the Parochial Schools Committee, the Poor Rate League, and the Shoreditch Ratepayers' Association. The receipts from letting were £698 5s. 0d., the amount paid for cleaning after lettings £84 15s. 0d., the cost of Gras for the year, including consumption in Office, Vestry meetings, &c. was £155 7s. 0d., Insurance and Water Rate window cleaning and repairs amounted to about £50. DISORDERLY HOUSES. Since the proceedings to which I alluded in my last report, when in June, 1871, convictions were obtained against six persons, two of whom were sentenced to twelve months hard labour, and a fine of £50; three from the Vinegar Ground to four months hard labour each, and one from Nancy Street was required to find bail to come up for judgment when required, no other proceedings have been taken. The result of those proceedings was to reduce the number of Brothels in the N Division of Police from about 70 to about 20, but some of those who left through fear of prosecution have returned, and complaints have been made by the inhabitants. In consequence peremptory notices have been served on all the keepers to immediately close the houses and quit the parish, or warrants will be forthwith obtained. I have reason to believe that those notices have had the desired effect: all who fail to obey them will be prosecuted without further warning. 14 CONTRACTS. The contracts for Dusting, Scavenging and Watering this year and last, were as follows:— DUSTTNG AND SCAVENGING. 1872. 1871. East Division.. Messrs. Stroud £2800 Messrs. Stroud £3000 West Division Mr. Dodd £2600 Mr. Crane £2655 WATERING. Whole Parish Mr. Crane £1000 Mr. Crane £1020 I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, E. WALKER, Town Hali,, Shoreditch, Vestry Clerk. June, 1872. REPORT OF THE ACCOUNTANT. To the Vestry of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, Gentlemen, Herewith I present for the information of the Vestry, the annexed report, comprising a statement of all receipts and disbursements, under orders of the Vestry; likewise an account in Abstract of the monies owing to, with debts and liabilities against the Vestry at the termination of the last financial year, being in accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act. On reference to the tables it will be seen that the amount raised in one year by Poor and Vestry Rates alone was £115,610 19s. 4d., there being an increase in the amount collected on the Poor Rate of £15,478 15s. 9d., while there is a reduction of the amounts of Vestry Rates levied of £10,440 0s. 9d., as compared with the last published statement. It is further shown under column heading "Hire of Town Hall," that the amount received from persons during the year 1871-2 was £698 5s. 0d., a sum less by £218 than was realized during 1870-1; which, with other minor amounts make an aggregate receipt of £117,375 18s. 9d., that is after making the following deductions:—Balance in hand at the commencement of the year, £6,393 5s. 10d., transfer from Consolidated Rate, £1,262 5s. 8d., Temporary Loan to Poor Rate, £3,500, and £5 l1s. 9d. from Mortgage Debt Fund to close account. The chief items forming tbe expenditure will be found to be payment to the Ghuardians £57,500, being £8,500 in excess of last year, 16 while there is a decrease of £3,283 in the amount levied by precepts from the Metropolitan Board of Works. These with payments on account of Police Rate £12,540, County Rate £5,994, Collectors' Poundage and Officers' Salaries, £3,265, and other disbursements not here specially mentioned, make a total approaching £117,700. In the statement of the Rates collected, the actual deficiency from arrears, losses, &c., &c., upon one year's assessment was £17,084, being a loss of about 13 per cent., deducting the amount collected from the first charge of the assessment. It will be observed that £2,801 in the loss column, is a reduction on appeal by the London and North Western Railway Company. Any further information may be obtained by a perusal of the appended Tables, which upon the whole show a satisfactory account of the finances of the Parish.

East Division 987 West Division 1093 As regards the general condition of the parish, I beg to state, that the carriageway paving is in very good order, as the greater portion of it is composed of new work; there are a few places which must, before long be repaved, such as— High Street, Shoreditch, (from Bateman's Row to the Boundary). And Hoxton Street (portions of). The footways are mostly in an unsatisfactory and dilapidated condition, and the repairs during the year having been very slight, I fear that unless some of the worst places are repaved, and that very shortly, they will become dangerous. The course I would recommend would be, to repave those footways in the thoroughfares of larger traffic with new stone, using such of the old material as is fit for places of less traffic. The condition of the sewerage is very satisfactory, the sewers being comparatively free from deposit, and there are but few places without that most necessary of sanitary requirements. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, G. C. PERRETT, Surveyor. Town Hall, June, 1872.
