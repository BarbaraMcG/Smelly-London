August, 1961 To: The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the annual report on the health and sanitary circumstances in the Borough for the year 1960 The report of the Public Analyst, T. McLachlan Esq., C.M A.C. G. F.C , F.R.I.C . is included. The health of the inhabitants of the Borough has continued to be satisfactory and there was no serious outbreak of infectious disease during the year. Staff changes during the year were as follows- The only member of the staff to retire was Mr G Churchill, Mortuary Keeper who reached the age of 65 in March, after 31 years service with the department The retirement of Mr Churchill, who unfortunately had not had very good health of recent years coincided with the Council's decision to close the Mortuary and allow Fulham cases to be dealt with by the Hammersmith Borough Council Mortuary which has been modernised and enlarged This arrangement became effective from the 1st June Two Public Health Inspectors resigned during the year to take appointments with other authorities Mr D. Brisk 8 years' service, went to the London County Council and Mr R Griffiths, 3½ years' service went to the County Borough of Croydon The only appointment as Inspector during the year was that of Mr J W Deards, previously a student, who qualified in July There were four vacancies for District Public Health Inspectors at the end of the year. Repeated advertisements have failed to attract applicants and students appear to be the sole source for replacements. Mrs. V J. Warrier, part-time shorthand-typist, resigned in June after being with the department for 4½ years and was replaced by Mrs, E R Read as a full-time shorthand-typist. The only other staff change was the appointment of Mr. H.J. Edwards as an additional Enquiry Officer for smoke control area surveys. This appointment resulted from the decision of the Council to speed up the clean air programme 5 Clean Air The Clean Air Programme has been reviewed and the date by which the whole of the Borough should be subject to spoke control brought forward to October, 1965. During the year the clean air film "Window to the Sky", produced by the Gas Council, was released for general showing. This film was produced in collaboration with the Fulham Health Department and many of the scenes were taken in Fulham. with Health Department staff filling many of the roles. Water As an added safeguard for the health of the public, regular monthly sampling of domestic water from the mains has been introduced. There is no doubt as to the purity and safety of the water as supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board but the new arrangement provides early warning of possible contamination arising from defects in the local supply pipes. Many of these pipes must now be very old and the possibility of contamination, although slight, must be borne in mind and looked for regularly. Details of the findings are given in the body of the report on page 37. Close co-operation is maintained with the Medical Officer of the Metropolitan Water Board, Dr. E. Windle Taylor, to whom copies of all reports on water samples are sent. A circular in December 1959 from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government drew attention to the urgent national need for economy in the use of water. I am of the opinion that far more use should be made of shower baths in new dwellings and conversions, as one valuable way of economising in water usage. A slipper bath uses 30 gallons of water compared with the two to three gallons used with a shower. There are corresponding benefits from economy in water heating costs. Shower baths are also preferable for old people, who often have great difficulty in entering or leaving slipper baths. There is also scope for improved methods of plumbing. Hot water systems are often arranged so that there is a long run of pipe from the hot water storage system to the tap and millions of gallons of water must be wasted annually in letting the unwanted cold water in the dead space of the pipe run to waste before the hot water reaches the tap. The ideal arrangement is an instant type of water heater at or near the point of use of the hot water and the development of such an appliance is called for in the national interest. Such a device would enable the existing type of water system to be simplified, with considerable economy in house building and water heating costs. Food Hygiene Food hygiene is a subject which has received much attention nationally over the past years but from the public health point of view, the results achieved to date are very disappointing. 6 The root of the problem is the low standard of hygiene in food handling which the nation generally is prepared to accept without complaint and the lack of knowledge of elementary food hygiene by the majority of food handlers Many of the persons working in food handling are employed casually or temporarily There is a constant turnover in personnel and this prevents any serious attempt at proper training in the hygiene of food handling. The only hope would appear to be raising the status of food handlers to attract persons to it as a permanent career and to require proper training of all persons engaged in the trade. Large sums have been spent by the catering trade to modernise food shops and fittings but until the food handler is properly trained and educated to use them, then the public health is still endangered. As an example, I have seen an assistant in a Cafe which was equipped with modern protective display cabinets, etc. and provided with plastic "forceps" for the hygienic handling of the exposed sandwiches and cakes, actually placing the sandwiches into the "forceps" by hand, thereby completely negativing the safeguards for which the forceps were provided. In a different establishment, I have seen the reverse procedure taking place with fancy cakes! Under the Pood Hygiene Regulations, proper facilities for the washing of hands are required in food handling premises. Unfortunately, almost without exception, the hand washing facilities provided to comply with the law are so sited that they are rarely or never used by the staff. It would appear that food shops or restaurants, etc which value their reputations have missed a golden opportunity to place staff hand-washing facilities in positions where not only would they be convenient for frequent use by the staff whilst working but also where customers could see the staff using them Unfortunately, as long as the public is prepared to accept appallingly low standards of hygiene in food handling premises, little progress can be expected I would emphasise that mere compliance with the letter of the law by the provision of hand washing facilities for use by food-handling staff, cannot protect the public health It is the regular, frequent and proper use of these facilities that is the safeguard. Domestic rubbish During the year the Council approved a scheme of the Works and Highways Committee whereby the collection of domestic refuse was widened in scope to include the removal, free of charge, of old furniture, bicycles, carpets and general lumber. Previously such items had only been removed for payment and, as a result, there were few houses in the Borough which had not got old lumber stored in the yard or garden or on the roof of outbuildings, etc. This practice was most undesirable. It led to the dumping of rubbish in open spaces. The lumber formed harbourage for rats and, if against a wall of a house, it encouraged dampness and disrepair. It could also be a source of infection for wood worm and dry rot and, in addition, these collections of rubbish were an eyesore to neighbours and a disfigurement to the Borough. The new arrangement for the removal of rubbish is heartily welcomed by the Public Health Department and has proved of great assistance 7 Rodent Control In the body of the report, on page 45 is a detailed account of the work of the Department in respect of rodent control. The Fulham sewage system is connected to the network of sewers serving all the London area North of the Thames. It appears to me that the present method, whereby Local Authorities carry out their sewer treatments independently and without co ordination with the efforts of neighbour ing Boroughs, greatly reduces the benefits to be derived. If we substantially reduce the rat population of the sewers of Fulham, we only make space into which rats from other areas can move. In my opinion, what is needed is a co-ordinated plan, so that adjoining authorities undertake treatment simultaneously or in close succession, so that the rat population of London as a whole is given a severe blow at more or less one and the same time. It is appreciated that such a scheme would require careful planning and the fullest co-operation but the means for this already exist in the Workable Area Committees. It is also recognised that if certain of the dangerous poisons are to be used, additional trained teams of operatives will be needed at present many Boroughs employ private specialist firms for this work and their man power resources may not be adequate for a "blitz" programme but the problem is not insurmountable and the project is I feel, worthy of serious study In conclusion, it is a pleasure to record my sincere thanks to the Council and to the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their continued support and interest in the work of the Department Thanks are also due to my Chief Officer colleagues and their staffs with whom the Health Department works closely to my medical colleagues in hospital, general practice and the L.C.C. Divisional Office who are always so helpful and to the various local Organisations with which the Department works closely Last, but not least, I have to thank all the members of the staff of the Health Department for their loyalty and assistance at all times. I have the honour to be. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Medical Officer of Health. 8 Section A General and Vital Statistics Page Physical Features of Borough 9 Population and Area 9 Rateable Value and Product of Id Rate 9 Marriages 9 Births and Stillbirths No and Rate per 1 000 population 9 Deaths No and Rate per 1 000 population 10 Death Rate of Infants under 1 year of age 10 Maternal Mortality 10 Deaths, classification of causes of 10 Deaths, Infant Table of causes of 11 Deaths.

Its other boundaries are formed by the Boroughs of Hammersmith in the west, Chelsea in the east, and the Royal Borough of Kensington in the north. It is very flat and low lying being only 12-13 ft. above sea level The subsoil is of flood plain gravel overlying London clay 20 to 40 ft below Subsoil water is rarely met within 15 ft. of the ground surface. Fulham is principally a dormitory Borough with a fringe of heavy industrial undertakings on the riverside, and is well served with open spaces and parks which have been added to by post-war development. The slum clearance and redevelopment programmes are also having the dual effect of improving the standard of housing and the appearance of the Bor 1,706 acres Population (estimated mid-1960) 112,960 Separately Rated Dwellin 29,796 Rateable Valu £1,955. 578 Rate levied - 18s. 6d. in the £-Estimated Yield £1,731,600 A Penny Rate produces approximately . £7.800 No. of assessments 33,760 No. of Marriages registered during the year 898 The Registrar General's estimate gives the mid-year population of the Borough as 112 960 - a decrease compard with 1959 of 340. Ten years ago in 1950. the estimated population was 123,400 The birth rate is 15 99 compared with 15.56 in 1959. Ten years ago the birth rate was 14.35 The infant mortality rate has risen to 22 01 compared with 21 46 in 1959. The figure for Bigland and Wales in 1960 is 21.7. The death rate in 1960 shows a decrease compared with 1959 - being 10.89 as compared with 12.09. Heart disease continues to be the main "killer" with cancer the next most important. This is dramatically shown in the diagram on page 13 where it will be seen that heart disease and cancer together account for nearly half the total number of deaths. With an ageing population, it is likely that this propor tion will increase in future years.

There has been a steady decline in the incidence and mortality of this disease since the end of the war, largely due to the introduction at that time of drugs which are effective against the tubercle bacillus. The dramatic improvement is shown by the fact that, in 1950, the tuberculosis death rate per 100,000 population was 34.0. The notification rate for tuberculosis in 1960 was 73.5 compared with 78.5 in 1959. Ten years ago, in 1950, the rate was 184.7.

The following tables from information kindly supplied by the Consultant Chest Physician, Dr. H. C. Price, show the position as far as Fulham is concerned and also the nationality of the immigrants and the length of time they were in this Country before the disease was indent.ified.

H. C. PRICE - CHEST PHYSICIAN) TUBERCULOSIS The number of new notifications of pulmonary tuberculosis continued to decline from 83 for 1959 to 71 for the year under review. The number of new non pulmonary notifications, however, rose from 6 for 1959 to 12 for 1960, this increase being due mainly to 5 notifications of tuberculous adenitis, the highest number for many years. Two of these patients were over 60 years of age, and the other three had come to this country from Eire. The number of deaths (from 21 in 1959 to 17 in 1960) has fallen at much the same rate as for the new notifications; of these deaths 76% were over the age of 60 years and 50% were over 70 years of age. The deaths of some of these patients were ascribed to heart disease or bronchitis, but the main contributory cause was tuberculosis. Increasing numbers of patients are being removed from the Tuberculosis Register as cured. This is, of course, the direct result of the changed situation in the treatment of tuberculosis, where,if the patient is seen and adequate treatment is commenced before the 20 patient is in an advanced stage of phthisis, then there is usually a 100% chance of a complete cure taking place. In practice this does mean that in spite of the continued fall in the number of newly notified cases, the number of patients attending for treatment and follow up increased, a tendency noted in most parts of the country, since some of the more chronic cases have to be treated for a number of years and their follow-up is much more prolonged. Of course, in the past many would have died within 5 years of notification. The attendance figures for the year were very much as usual, the routine tuberculous attendances rising from 2086 in 1959 to 2102 in 1960 AFTER-CARE After-Care for both tuberculous and non-tuberculous chest patients continues to be very necessary, more especially now that there is less long-term hospital treatment. Problems dealt with covered a wide field. People of stable personality needed mainly practical help of various kinds to face their illness. On the practical side, co-operation with the Local Authorities and National Assistance Board enabled patients to be provided with free extra nourishment, recuperative holidays, free or at a reduced cost, referral to the Home Help Service and many other agencies. Close contact was maintained with the London County Council and Borough Housing Departments, and when the medical needs were acute the application was occasionally successful Housing problems tend, however, to be long drawn out. Following illness, family, work, and personality problems may arise, which might have been resolved had the housing been adequate and the patient fit. Patients with such problems often made heavy and continuing demands for support from the clinic workers, and rehabilitation to as normal a life as possible was the aim To help further this aim, a Re-Settlement Clinic continued to be held once a month, in which the Ministry of Labour Disablement Re Settlement Officer, the Chest Physician, the Care Organiser and the patient discussed mutually, the individual problems of return to working life. Sometimes suitable work was found quite quickly, sometimes a period at an Industrial Rehabilitation Unit helped the patient to re establish himself. Divisional Therapy and twice weekly classes at the Pottery Workshop also assisted in rehabilitation. The Pottery Workshop held its first Exhibition in November, 1960, which was very successful. The Fulham Tuberculosis Care Committee continued to give financial help to clinic patients to ease difficulties for which the State does not provide. Help of this kind was given through the Care Organiser on 72 occasions, including fares, holidays, coal, clothing, wireless repairs, etc. Special gifts at Christmas were also given to 40 patients. The Care Organiser was. of course, always available to listen to patients personal problems, to discuss them and where possible to help the patient to reach the solution best suited to himself 21 DISEASES OTHER THAN TUBERCULOSIS The number of patients who attend for diseases other than tuberculosis continues to increase, this applies both to the number of new cases referred to the clinic and old cases still attending for treatment. This tendency will, of course, increase in the future. In fact, 274 such cases were referred to the clinic for the first time compared with 228 for 1959. THE POPULATION SURVEY OF RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS The pilot study of this survey was started in May 1959 and the survey itself started in January 1960 and continued throughout the year. The first six months of the year were spent in visiting the selected families in the sample and completing the questionnaires for each individual member. The information collected in this way has been collated transferred to punch cards and is now in the hands of the statisticians. RESPIRATORY DEATHS IN FULHAM Owing to the relatively mild winter of 1959/60 the number of deaths from non respiratory disease has shown a fall off from the previous year. However the deaths from lung cancer remain unaffected hy the better weather. Comparative Figures for the Three Main Causes of Death from Respiratory Causes TUBERCULOSIS Pulmonary TOTAL Males Females 1958 22 8 30 1959 20 1 21 1960 16 1 17 BRONCHITIS 1958 80 44 124 1959 87 47 134 1960 52 29 81 LUNG CANCER 1958 70 14 84 1959 80 16 96 1960 72 23 95 ALLERGY There has been a general increase in the number of patients referred because of symptoms of allergic asthma, such patients attend for skin sensitivity tests and, in suitable cases undergo a course of desensitisation with a prepared vaccine. As a general rule this form of treatment is only carried out in those patients who have a raised eosinophile count in both blood and sputum specimens. 22 CARCINOMA OF THE BRONCHUS Early diagnosis and a quick decision as to the most suitable form of treatment, associated with the minimum of delay before its implementation remains the only rational policy in this disease at the present time. With the co operation of the Mass X ray Department, the Local General Practitioners and our surgical colleagues, patients can in the majority of cases start their treatment with radical surgery or radiotherapy within ten days of their first abnormal x ray, Normally, after this first x ray a new patient is seen at the clinic and referred to our bronchoscopic clinic all within the space of a week. It is the long delay in obtaining diagnostic confirmation and a surgical opinion and treatment which is one of the causes for the bad results for this disease in many centres. PHYSIOTHERAPY The sole form of treatment available for the average patient with bronchitis is chemotherapy of the acute relapse associated with tipping and graduated breathing exercises. Breathing Exercise Classes have continued throughout the year interrupted from time to time by the shortage of a full time physiotherapist. This state of affairs will be remedied in 1961 with the appointment of further staff in this Department, IN PATIENT TREATMENT The old tuberculosis wards are now at last undergoing radical upgrading into single, double and larger cubicles, and one such ward is to be air conditioned for the treatment of chronic respiratory disease. These wards should be completed and open for the reception of patients during the summer of 1961. The Chest Clinic is still one of the few units of the National Health Service where the clinical, preventive and social medicine aspects of health are combined in one unit. The fortunate accident that prevented the dichotomy that afflicts the other sections of the Health Service was not extended to tuberculosis, and this has allowed the old tuberculosis dispensary to develop into the modern chest clinic of today, where the patient can be treated as a whole and not simply the diseased portion, and disease can be seen in its true perspective as a variation of the normal, due to various adverse environmental factors. Many misguided individuals hope that as tuberculosis wanes so the necessity for chest clinics will decrease, so that this unfortunate accident of the Health Service Act of uniting treatment and prevention aspects of the health service can be quickly forgotten. It is to be hoped that sane councils will prevail, and the policy that guides the chest clinics will spread to other aspects of our curative services. 23 COMPARATIVE SUMMARY OF STATISTICS FOR ANNUAL REPORT 1960 Number of New Patients Attending 1960 1959 Non Tuberculous Chest Cases 274 (228) Contacts 147 (126) Transfer-In Notifications 63 (63) No, of Clinic Attendances Notified Cases of Tuberculosis 2, 102 (2,086) Contacts of Cases of Tuberculosis 3,819 (4,019) Other Chest Diseases 1.767 (1,558) 7,688 (7,663) No, of New Notifications of Tuberculosis in Fulham Pulmonary 71 (83) Non-Pulmonary 12 (6) No, of Deaths in Fulham Pulmonary Tuberculosis 17 (21) Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis (-) Bronchitis 81 (114) Cancer of the Lung 95 (96) No, Taken off Tuberculosis Register as CURED Pulmonary 48 (25) Non-Pulmonary 7 (-) No. of visits by Chest Physician 71 (62) No. of visits by Health Visitors 2,862 (3,409) No. of X-Rays taken 3,701 (3,616) No. of Patients undergoing Treatment at Home 7 (8) No. of B.

REPORT FROM THE SOUTH WEST LONDON MASS X RAY SERVICE (SUPPLIED BY COURTESY OF DR F. A. NASH MEDICAL DIRECTOR) The Central Mass X Ray Centre at Western Hospital, Seagrave Road, Fulham, from which the South West London Mass X Ray Service operates three mobile Units, continued throughout the year to provide a regular one-day a week service to the public. Although people from all parts of South West London attend there, the Centre is particularly used by those who live or work in Fulham. In addition to private individuals, who can attend between 2-4 p.m. and 5-7 p.m. on Wednesdays, many general practitioners in the Borough refer their patients there, and employees from local firms and organisations attend hy arrangement with the managements concerned. 24 During 1960, 14,866 mass miniature chest x-rays were taken at the Western Hospital, of which 5,780 were doctors' patients. Seven visits to factories were made by the mobile Unit, as a result of which a further 1,756 examinations were made. Seven Fulham Firms are continuing to co-operate in the special six monthly service for their male employees who are 45 years of age and over, which was started in 1958 in an attempt to afford some protection against the hazards of lung cancer, which is causing an increasing number of deaths, particularly among men in the older age group. This service is also available to and is being used hy men of that age group who live in Fulham a considerable number of whom are keeping the six monthly appointments they receive to attend the Western Hospital Mass X Ray Centre. This Centre also provides a special large film service for patients sent by the Ante-Natal Clinics in the Borough., and for schoolchildren who require an x ray in connection with the B. C. GVaccination Scheme. The Mass X-Ray Service provided x-ray facilities to assist the Fulham Chest Clinic in carrying out the Fulham Health Survey, and also in following up a number of young people in their first years of employment, who were positive reactors to the Mantoux test before they left school. The South West London Mass X Ray Units invite all citizens in the Borough to make full use of this Service to safeguard the health of themselves, their families, and those with whom they work. FOOD POISONING During the year twenty single cases were notified and in nine of these the causative agent was identified as follows:- Agent Identified No, of Cases Salmonella Typhi-murium 6 " Thompson 1 " Ehteritidis 2 There was one mild family outbreak notified of six cases but no causative organism was found. SCABIES AND ALLIED CONDITIONS (Treatment Centre-Disinfecting Station, Townmead Road) The Centre which was established in January 1957, is open on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1.30 to 4.30 p.m. During the time of bathing the clothing is heat treated and is ready to wear afterwards. The work of bathing men is undertaken by the existing staff under the supervision of the Superintendent, and the bathing of women and children by a part-time female bathing attendant. Medical practitiones are notified after treatment has been carried out. 25 Number of treatments carried out during the year:- Adults 76 Children (under 5 years) 9 Children of school age are referred to local L. C,C. School Treatment Centres. AUTHENTICATION OF VACCINATION AND INOCULATION CERTIFICATES In several parts of the world certificates of vaccination and/or inoculations are not accepted unless they are endorsed by a Medical Officer in the Government or Municipal Service of the country of issue. The form of authentication which appears to be most readily accepted by Health Authorities abroad is that given by Public Health Authorities; whereby practitioners signatures are verified by the Medical Officer of Health. The Minister of Health therefore has asked Local Authorities to make arrangements under which any person who desires to have a certificate of vaccination or inoculation for the purpose of travel abroad may have it stamped accordingly at the office of the Health Department. The purpose of the authentication is to provide proof to those Health Authorities abroad who desire it that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. Authenticators are not required to certify that the vaccination or inoculation has been properly carried out or. indeed, that it has been carried out at all; the responsibility for issuing the certificate remains with the doctor signing it. This does not imply any suggestion that a certificate of vaccination or inoculation issued by a registered Medical Practitioner requires any official supervision or control in order to be of adequate medical value. Authentication is not a requirement of Her Majesty's Government but the proposal is designed as a remedy for difficulties which have in practice been met by persons from this country travelling abroad. During the year a total of 620 certificates of vaccination and/or inoculation were authenticated. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS The following bacteriological examinations were carried out for the Council on specimens submitted by general practitioners and the Public Health Department during the Year:- Nose and Throat Swabs 33 Faeces 1,045 Urine 8 Miscellaneous 13 26 Section C _________ Personal Services Page Hospitals and other Centres in the Borough 27 L C C Personal Health Services 28 Home Nursing Fulham District Nursing Association 29 Old Peoples Welfare in Fulham 31 Bathing facilities for the Elderly 33 S.O.S.

Close co operation is maintained between the Divisional Medical Officer, Dr. B.RA. Sharpe, and the Medical Officer of Health and between appropriate members of their respective staffs. To facilitate the necessary close co-operation meetings are held between the Divisional M.O. and the M.O.H. of the three Metropolitan Boroughs forming Division No. 1 of the L.C.C. Many problems encountered by the Health Department have aspects which require the attention of the Divisional services and vice versa. In the former category for example are the old people with housing cr other environmental problems which are dealt with by the Health Department and who are often found to require the assistance of the services of the L.C.C. e.g. Home Help. The Health Department has also assisted the L.C.C. by providing accommodation in the Town Hall for public immunisation sessions during the special anti-poliomyelitis inoculation drive. The location of the Town Hall close to Fulham Broadway Station enabled many young people who work in the West End or City to obtain their injections with a minimum of inconvenience. The following information on the Clinic Services of the London County Council and the statistical data have been kindly supplied by Dr. B.E.A. Sharpe, L. C. C. Medical Officer.

Although the overall total visits have decreased during the last five years, the visits to the age group over 65 years have increased as follows 31 Year Total visits to over 65's Percentage of Total 1956 39,221 67% 1957 41, 206 72% 1958 42,816 75% 1959 41,770 76% 1960 44, 513 82% OLD PEOPLE' S WELFARE IN FULHAM INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY MR. C. F, THATCHER', LL.B., HONORARY SECRETARY FULHAM OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE COMMITTEE The Ftolham Old People's Welfare Committee is a co-ordinating and advisory body set up for the furtherance of old people's welfare in the Borough of Fulham. It is a voluntary organisation which has as its members, representatives of authorities and organisations concerned with the welfare of the aged. It derives its income mainly from grants from the Borough Council. The following activities in this field have been selected as being of general interest. Meals on Wheels and Luncheon Clubs These services, which are undertaken mainly by the Women's Voluntary Service in co operation with the Committee, enable a hot midday meal to be provided either in the homes of old people who are infirm and cannot manage to prepare a meal for themselves or at one of the four centres in the Borough run by voluntary organisations. The charge to old people is 10d, although the cost of each meal is 2/6d the balance being made up of the London County Council's subvention of 1/- and a subsidy of 8d. from the Borough Council, In the spring of 1961, the price of the meals from the local caterer was increased from 2/- to 2/6d as it was found impossible to continue to obtain a meal of the standard required at a figure of 2/- The increase, however was not passed on to the old people who receive the meals, but has become an additional charge to be met by the Borough Council who also accept the responsibility for providing a delivery van and a driver Difficulty is still being experienced in the recruitment of voluntary help for delivering the meals to the housebound and also for serving them at luncheon clubs and it is unfortunate that this problem prevents a much needed extension of this work The total number of meals supplied by this service for the period ist January to 31st December i960, was 20 364 an increase of 2,061 over the previous year Invalid Meals Special dietetic meals for invalids have hitherto been provided by Invalid Meals for London In January 1960 however, due to administrative and financial difficulties Invalid Meals for London found it impossible to continue their work and in an emergency the London County Council used their powers under the National Health Service Act 1946 to undertake the service themselves The County Council now propose that legislation should be promoted to empower 32 Metropolitan Borough Councils to take over this service and these powers are likely to become available in 1962, In Fulham the invalid meals are prepared at a restaurant and kitchen in Munster Road and taken daily by mobile vans to the homes of those who qualify for them. A doctor's certificate is required in each case. The charge to the recipients is is 4d per meal. Social Clubs The 13 social clubs in the Borough all of which are run by voluntary organisations, have been well supported during the year They offer companionship to those who are lonely and the atmosphere of their weekly meetings is always convivial They arrange their own entertainment annual outings and Christmas activities towards the cost of which the Old People s Welfare Committee. in appropriate cases makes a grant Chiropody In April 1960 the London County Council accepted responsibility for all chiropody including the cost of treatment provided for old people at two centres in the Borough run by Bishop Creighton House and the British Red Cross Society with the aid of a grant from the Old People s Welfare Committee. The work of these voluntary organisations since that date has continued to operate on an agency basis "Hie charge made to all patients was 2s per treatment until 23rd January 1961, since when in accordance with a County Council's decision following a review of all charges for chiropody no charge has been made for treatment to persons receiving old age or normal retirement pensions. In the great majority ot cases therefore foot treatment for old people is now provided free This decision also applied to domiciliary chiropody which is available to old people who are unable through physical infirmity to visit a clinic and in most cases no charge is made for treatment Better facilities for chiropody are being provided hy the British Red Cross Society at 52. New Kings Road, S W 6 As part of the programme for rebuilding their headquarters at this address a new annexe has been built specially for this work and a new chiropody chair has been kindly presented to the Society by a firm of local manufacturers. The number of treatments given during the year (January to December. 1960) were as follows:- British Red Cross Society Clinic 599 Bishop Creighton House 677 Domiciliary Chiropody 244 Holiday Scheme This scheme which has run successfully for the past 11 years enables any resident of Fulham who is over the age of 60 to enjoy 33 a holiday at a good class, boarding house in Broadstairs at very reasonable terms during early and late summer periods During the season 1960 253 pensioners participated as compared with 241 in the previous summer. The charges and periods for the 1960 season were as follows:- Period 1960 Charge per week Return Fare 20th May to 3rd June £4 15/- 10th September to 24th September £4 15/ Holiday parties, escorted by volunteers from the Women s Voluntary Service and St John Ambulance Association travelled from Fulham Town Hall direct to boarding houses in Broadstairs The Rural District Council as in the past made several concessions to the holiday parties including free use of deck chairs and reduced rates of admission to entertainments Chri stmas Parcels Scheme A generous donation by His Worship the Mayor (Councillor Mrs. Florence C Pusey, J P ) from the Mayor's Party Fund made it possible, last Christmas, to distribute over 300 parcels to elderly Fulham residents living alone The names were selected from lists submitted j by local organisations and churches, and the parcels were delivered by Fulham boy scouts. One interesting feature of the scheme is that several local firms and private persons apply to the Town Hall for names of deserving old age pensioners to whom they wish to send Christmas gifts and the names are willingly supplied Local organisations who have schemes of their own co operate by sending their lists to the Town Hall for checking against the Mayor s own list This helps to avoid duplication and enables many more old people to benefit from Christmas gifts than would otherwise be the case BATHING FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY Public Baths Old people may obtain without charge a hot bath at the Fulham Baths on Tuesdays and Wednesdays between 10 a.m. and 12 noon, and 2p.m. and 4p.m. I am informed by the Baths Superintendent, Mr R C Gerred. M N A B S , M.I. Mar. E , that 30-40 persons a week take advantage of these facilities Home Bathing This service was commenced in April, 1954 It has proved immensely popular and not unduly costly. 34 Number of baths given during 1960 2,340 Number of persons receiving baths at end of year 98 Number of persons on waiting list at end of year 9 At the end of the year there were three part-time female attendants engaged on this work paid on a sessional basis. It is not easy to recruit suitable ladies for this work. They need to be physically strong, patient, kind and gentle and imbued with a desire to be of service to old people Authority exists to increase the number employed as and when there is an increased demand for the service.

Hie work is carried out at the Disinfecting Station where modern equipment enables the staff to deal quickly and efficiently with all demands By arrangement with Chelsea Borough Council the laundry of their old people is dealt with at the Station, The following 20,059 articles of Fulham residents were cleansed during the year:- Sheets 6,023 Pillow Cases 1,828 Towels 2,576 Underwear 6, 397 Mattress Covers 200 "Pieces" 2,558 Blankets 477 35 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 19 48, SECTION 47 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 19 51 Visiting of old people whose circumstances require assessment under the above Acts is carried out by the Public Health Department. No compulsory removals were found necessary under either Act Departmental Records of Old People The details of old persons as they become known are recorded in the Department and the number, although fluctuating is generally on the increase:- Number of new cases investigated in 1960 288 Number of above recorded for supervision in 1960 152 Number of deaths recorded in 1960 51 Number of old people admitted to Hospitals Homes and Institutions permanently 43 Number of cases referred to other Authorities and Organisations, or Miscellaneous 8 Number left District 13 Hospital Liaison Visits 103 Re-visits 1,188 Total number of cases under supervision at end of year 482 Total number of cases recorded in Department 1 568 36 Section D Sanitary Circumstances of the Area Page Water Sampling 37 Visits to Dwellings by Public Health Inspectors 37 Statutory Action 37 Summary of Works carried out under supervision of Public Health Inspectors 38 Legal Proceedings 38 Works in Default 38 Land Charges 39 Noise Nuisances 39 Hairdressers and Barbers 41 Disinfection.

This shortage increased to three with a resignation in February. A fourth vacancy arose with a further resignation in the summer, but fortunately this was offset by one of the Council's students passing his qualifying examination and being appointed to the permanent staff Owing to the understaffing there was a regrettable drop in the number of house-to-house inspections which could be undertaken, but in most other respects the pattern and extent of inspections followed a fairly close relationship with those of recent years Water Sampling As mentioned in the introduction regular monthly sampling for bacteriological examination of domestic supplies in different parts of the borough was introduced at the beginning of the year.

In 38 cases notices were outstanding at the time of search, and these were declared accordingly. NOISE NUISANCES In appropriate circumstances action has previously been taken informally or under Section 76 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act. 1937 During the year the Noise Abatement Act, 1960, was passed and became operative from 27th November Where a noise or vibration is deemed to be a nuisance it becomes under this Act a statutory nuisance and the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, procedure can be followed by the local authority An abatement notice can be served on the person causing the nuisance or on the owner or occupier of the premises on which it arises. Such a notice can be enforced by proceedings at Magistrates' Courts In addition three or more occupiers of land or premises who are aggrieved by a noise nuisance may complain to a Magistrate. Neither of these actions, however can be taken regarding noises or vibrations from aircraft nor in the case of noise or vibration caused by statutory undertakers in the exercise of their powers Where a complaint concerns a trade or business it is a defence to show that the best practicable means have been used for preventing a noise or vibration and counteracting the effects. The Act also prohibits the use of loudspeakers in streets between 9pm. and 8 a.m. except in defined circumstances (police, fire brigade, ambulance, etc.) and at any other time for advertising any trade, business or entertainment, with the exception that a loud speaker operated on a vehicle between noon and 7 p.m. so as not to give reasonable cause for annoyance of persons in the vicinity may be used in connection with the sale of perishable foodstuffs. During the year 65 visits were made to premises in connection with 13 complaints of noise nuisances. The following table sets out the various noise nuisances alleged and the results of any action taken following investigations:- Nature of complaint Action taken (if any) 1 Noisy moving machinery of roadmaking materials plant. Owners approached informally. More modern plant installed. Complaint since ceased 2 Noise from car breaking in open yard. Greater use of oxy-acetylene burner suggested instead of manual hammering. Co-operation secured from occupier and complaints since ceased 3 Noise from repairing of sewing machines. Some noise inevitably suffered by tenant living directly over factory Complainant obtained other accommodation and flat subsequently let to a friend of the proprietor.

Management decided to do testing on job sites only 5 Noise from diesel operated fork lift truck Re-siting of work within factory and fitting of silencer brought great improvement and complaints ceased 6 Noise from panel beating in repairs garage Panel beating at premises reduced to minimum on request. No further complaint received 7 Noise from sheet metal works At first sound insulation measures taken and noisy work re-sited within factory, but finally decided to have all heavy work carried out at Midlands' works 8 Noise from pile driver Due to essential foundation works of temporary nature, Work confined to daylight hours No statutory action called for in circumstances 9 Noise from taxis leaving and entering garage early morning and late at night Some noises inevitable to longstanding business but managerial co-operation to keep them to a minimum was forthcoming 10 Noise from circular saws in joinery works Some sound insulation works carried out and week-end work reduced Complaints have ceased 11 Noise from dry-cleaning machinery in open yard Not considered excessive by Council's officers but owner voluntarily resited machinery within premises 12 Noisy machinery in light engineering works Factory work was being carried out in accommodation forming part of a residential terrace Works now removed to factory premises elsewhere causing no nuisance. 13 Noise from basement engineering works Nature of business changed to types of work not involving use of machinery. In addition to the above complaints applying to specific premises, complaints have been received regarding traffic noises When these are related to vehicles of a particular factory or depot, the management's co-operation is sought to minimise any inconvenience to neighbouring householders This does not however, cover the wider problem of general traffic on main roads, which can be and is often the cause of heavy and continuous background noise, and regarding which no practical solution is at present available. 41 HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS The number of registered hairdressers and barbers increased during the year to 96 48 inspections were made and no statutory action was found necessary Evidently the drive made during 1959 to improve these premises to the byelaws' standard had met with success DISINFECTION, DISINFESTATION and LAUNDRY SERVICES PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT 1936 The following details relate to the services provided by the Disinfecting Superintendent and his staff during i960 Number of rooms disinfested 694 Number of rooms disinfected after Infectious Disease 39 Number of wards and rooms disinfected in Maternity Hospital 45 Number of articles stoved 5,534 Laundry carried out for the Refuse Destructor staff Bath Towels 1 281 Dust Coats 42 Roller Towels 65 Boiler Suits 5 Hand Tbwels 3 The disinfecting staff have also dealt with infestation from cockroaches, beetles, ants, silver fish moths, etc, List of verminous and stained articles destroyed during 1960:- Bedsteads and Bedsprings 3 Mattresses 52 Beds 14 Bolsters 4 Pillows 37 Sheets 18 Blankets 22 Furniture 8 Cushions 10 Covers 5 Divans 8 Carpets 9 Clothing 75 Rags and Pieces Large Quantity HOUSING ACT, 19 57 DEMOLITION AND CLOSING ORDERS No demolition orders were made during the year Three closing orders were made in respect of whole houses as follows:- 42 Premises Date of Order 12, Lanfrey Place 9. 3. 1960 10, Lundy Street 9. 3. 1960 146.

IMPROVEMENT GRANTS (HOUSING ACTS 1949 1957) I am indebted to the Borough Architect and Director of Housing, Mr. E. A. H. MacDonald. A. R.I.B. A , for the following particulars applicable to 1960:- Applications Applications received dealt with Discretionary grants 53 45 Standard grants 59 45 In each case the Public Health Department is given an opportunity to check whether proposals comply with statutory and byelaw requirements. SLUM CLEARANCE PROGRAMMES The joint programmes with the London County Council for the period 1951-1960 were completed last year During 1960 a further programme, involving 217 premises, was agreed by the two authorities for completion by 1965. RENT ACT, 1957 The administration regarding questions of certificates of disrepair under this Act continued to work smoothly. The examination of documents and giving of advice was undertaken in the Town Clerk's Department, whilst inspections, preparations of forms and correspondence were carried out by the Public Health Department staff. The number of applications received fell to one-third of those made in 1959 and to one-tenth of those received in 1958. When visiting premises it was often found that nuisances under the Public Health (London) Act existed, sometimes, but by no means always included in the tenant's notice (Form G) Independent statutory action was taken to secure abatement of nuisances whether or not so included. 43 During the year no certificate of disrepair issued by the Council was challenged by any owner or occupier in the County Court. There are still 94 certificates issued under the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, uncancelled, two being cancelled during 1960. 84 Certificates under the 1957 Act were outstanding at the end of the year. Details of action taken between 1st January and 31st December, 1960, are as follows:- Applications for certificates 21 Decisions not to issue certificates 2 Decisions to issue certificates 19 (a) in respect of some but not all defects 11 (b) in respect of all defects 8 Undertakings given by landlords 13 Undertakings refused by Council Nil Certificates issued 4 Applications by landlords to Council for cancellation of certificates 10 Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates Council decisions to cancel in spite of tenants' objections 6 3 Certificates cancelled 5 HABITATION CERTIFICATES UNDER SECTION 95(2) OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1936 During the year 19 certificates were issued in respect of 421 newly erected dwellings in the Borough. REHOUSING OF FULHAM RESIDENTS The situation in relation to the rehousing of Fulham residents remains substantially the same as last year, with priority being given to families displaced from slum clearance and compulsory purchase areas. Number of families rehoused by London County Council 58 Number of families rehoused by Fulham Borough Council 154 212 DWELLINGS COMPLETED BY THE COUNCIL between 1st January and 31st December, 1960 Information supplied by the courtesy of the Borough Architect and Director of Housing:- 44 Estate and Block Date Completed No. of Dwellings No. of Rooms Total Rooms 1 2 3 4 Clem Attlee Court 17. 10. 60 236 34 40 120 42 642 Barclay Close 28. 3. 60 40 - 10 10 20 130 Ethel Rankin Court 26. 3. 60 9 3 - 3 3 24 Passfields 28. 3. 60 24 3 - 15 6 72 Gibbs Green 26. 11. 60 130 30 32 60 8 306 St. Augustine's Church (Lintaine Close) 8. 10. 60 10 2 - 8 - 26 449 72 82 216 79 1, 200 DRAINAGE OF NEW BUILDINGS and RECONSTRUCTION OF DRAINAGE A Senior Public Health Inspector specialises in the inspection and supervision and testing of drainage works and is available for advising contractors and plumbers etc. on any project During the year the following major drainage schemes were approved by the Public Health Committee - Addition to existing buildings or additional sanitary accommodation 96 Reconstruction of drainage system 3 Conversion of premises into flats 203 New buildings 57 Among the plans of new buildings submitted during the year one project is worthy of particular note. This was the development by the North Thames Gas Board of a site of approximately four acres bounded by Peterborough and Carnwath Roads, The building covers almost the whole of the area and consists of a six-storey main building with various ancillary lower buildings These will house both offices for administrative staff and various workshops and testing laboratories for gas appliances, and will be known as the New Watson House. Prior to building operations being commenced, the architects and engineers had consultation with the Borough Engineer and. owing to the large quantity of waste water to be discharged from the building, it was necessary to construct a special relief sewer in Peterborough Road to accommodate such a discharge. The drainage for the building and more particularly, the above ground sanitary plumbing was of a very complex nature necessitating frequent inspections and consultations between the Contractor, the Plumbing Sub-Contractors and the Senior Public Health Inspector. It is expected that the building will be completed and occupied some time in the autumn of 1961. The majority of the plans submitted for conversion of properties into flats were submitted by the Borough Architect and each of these was inspected by the Senior Public Health Inspector, again necessitating numerous visits and consultations. 45 RODENT CONTROL The following is a summary of the work carried out by the Rodent Operatives during the year: - Type of Property Total Local Authority Duel ling Houses Business & Industrial Premises 1.

No. of visits made by Rodent Operatives - 6, 172 725 6,897 The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 places responsibility upon the occupier of land or premises to notify the Local Authority of the presence of rats or mice on those premises. The Local Authority is empowered, through its officers, to inspect and prescribe the necessary treatments and, if necessary, to order structural work to rid the premises of rodents and to prevent reinfestation. In addition to the investigation of notifications of the presence of rodents, premises are inspected periodically for the purpose of discovering infestations and to supervise the carrying out of proper treatment. The Council provides a free baiting treatment for private dwellings but charges for treatments carried out to business premises. A staff of three trained rodent operatives is employed under the supervision of a Senior Public Health Inspector. Since 1946, for Rodent Control purposes, the Metropolitan Area has been divided into four Areas. Fulham is in No. 4 Area, together with the Boroughs of Hammersmith, Chelsea, Kensington. Westminster, Paddington. St. Pancras, St Marylebone and Hampstead. A Committee composed of officers in charge of rodent control from each of these Authorities meets twice a year to discuss new methods of treatment and problems of rodent control. Fulham has again been honoured this year 46 by the re-appointment of the Senior Public Health Inspector, Mr F. E. Walsh, as Chairman of the Area Committee. The Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food has a Rodent Control Research Division which keeps Local Authorities advised of new techniques and poisons On the advice of this Research Division, during the past year we have used a new poison sodium fluoracetate for sewer treatment Results so far appear to indicate that a reduction of the rat population in the sewers has followed, as there are fewer surface infestations following these treatments. It is proposed in 1961 to carry out four treatments of the sewers using sodium fluoracetate, with a test baiting, without any poison, between the third and fourth treatments This should give an indication of the efficacy of this new weapon. Most cases of infestations of rats in dwellings in Fulham are traceable to defects in the drainage system, thus allowing rats from the sewers to enter the houses. In such cases the owner is called upon to repair the drainage system and further infestation is thus prevented. The total number of complaints received from residential business and industrial premises was the same as in 1959 i.e. 669. The following table shows the number of inspections made and treatments carried out in respect of rats and mice separately since 1950. As regards dwelling houses there has been little change in the incidence of rat infestation but there has been a considerable reduction in the number of complaints of mice. As regards business and industrial premises, there again is little significant change in the rat problem whilst the mouse infestations have increased markedly This may be due to the increased consumption of food in work and business premises, e g during tea breaks as any crumbs or scraps left about will encourage mice.

As one example of the excellent co operation experienced, managements now give notice to the department when any breakdowns or mechanical defects occur which might temporarily cause undue smoke emissions Such occasions apart, no contraventions have been observed from premises where the Council has responsibility for taking direct action On the few occasions when excessive dark smoke was observed from the stacks of the Fulham Generating Station, both the local superintendent and H. M. Alkali Inspector were informed. In each case there was an explanation for the emission. SMOKE CONTROL AREAS (a) Revision of Programme Under the original programme, it was planned to make all the Borough "smoke controlled" in ten annual stages, to be completed by October 1967. After considering the various ways in which this programme could be accelerated, it was finally decided to speed up the rate of progress so that the full project could be completed two years earlier, i.e. by October, 1965. This was done by increasing the size of the remaining areas to be dealt with and, apart from making a part-time survey assistant full-time meant no additional staff. It was also decided to review the smoke control programme annually. 48 (b) Progress made by Metropolitan Boroughs The Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee has produced a table showing the progress made up to November, 1960, by the London Boroughs and it was very gratifying to note that Fulham had the highest number of premises subject to Smoke Control Orders in force, viz., 12,177. (c) Position reached by the Council at 31.12.60 Area Acres No. of premises Operative Date 1 100 3,927 1.10.58 2 160 5,827 1.10.59 3 85 2,423 1.10.60 4 174 5,801 1.10.61 5 152 5,613 ) Survey in 1.10.62 proposed 6 47 14 ) progress 1.10.62 proposed (d) Publicity ~ No. 3 Smoke Control Area The third Smoke Control Order came into operation on 1st October. 1960. The procedure followed the now established pattern in accordance with the policy of the Council to inform every householder in the area of the reasons for the Smoke Control Order and of their responsibilities to avoid contraventions of the Order. The action taken was as follows: - (1) Following confirmation of the Order by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government on 12th January, 1960, all householders were sent a letter telling them of the action to take to obtain grant aid towards the cost of any necessary conversions or adaptations of their fireplaces (2) Estate Agents, coal merchants local builders, the North Thames Gas Board and the London Electricity Board were informed at the same time, and their attention drawn to the particular aspects of the Order with which they were most concerned. (3) The "Fulham Chronicle" published a message from the Chairman of the Public Health Committee, Councillor J. W. Perotti, in their editions of the 29th January and the 5th February together with an outline map of the area and a list of streets affected by the Order. (4) Exhibition and Film Show Central Library - 18.2.1960 Invitations to this one-day exhibition were sent with the householders' letter and attracted a total of 323 persons, with a further 88 attending the film show and "Any Questions" session in the evening. 49 Exhibitors were the North Thames Gas Board, London Electricity Board, Solid Smkeles's Fuels Federation, Green & London Ltd., the National Society for Clean Air and the Public Health Department. The films shown were "Guilty Chimneys" and "Window to the Sky", and questions were answered by a panel consisting of the Chairman of the Public Health Committee, the Deputy Medical Officer of Health, Clean Air Officer and representatives of the North Thames Gas Board and London Electricity Board. The attendance for a one day show was considered to be very satisfactory and all the exhibitors expressed themselves pleased with the arrangements There is no doubt that people will come to exhibitions if they feel there is something to be gained. The timing of the invitation is most important, and it is felt that, as in this case, it is best if it can be arranged to coincide with the announcement of confirmation of Orders and instructions on the action to take. A photograph of part of the Exhibition is reproduced on centre page. (5) Window Display This was on view at Messrs. Green & London's showrooms at Fulham Broadway The display detailed the action to be taken and showed a map of the area and the streets affected by the Order. (6) Reminder Leaflet This was distributed to householders by hand in the week ending 20th July. 1960. It was designed to remind people who had not taken action, that time was getting short and that after the 1st October, 1960. it would be an offence to emit smoke from their chimneys therefore conversions should be completed by this date. (7) Mobile exhibition vans - Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation North Thames Gas Board and London Electricity Board All these visited the area between January and October. The Department co-operated with the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation on their visit, which was for one week in September, during which 207 people visited the van. (e) West London Inter Boroughs' Smoke Control Liaison Committee Five meetings of this Committee were held during the year for the purpose of exchanging views and advice on common problems arising from the creation of Smoke Control Areas.

All complaints have been investigated but very rarely have they been found to fall within the scope of statutory nuisances and calling for action by the Local Authority. Nevertheless, where considered appropriate the firm or firms concerned have been approached and the alleged nuisance brought to their notice. More recently there has been an increase in the number of complaints received, particularly as regards noise and exhaust fumes from vehicles smells from factories, danger from traffic etc. As a result of this increased number of complaints the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, Mr E R Knight M Eng (Liv. ) etc and the Medical Officer of Health visited every major industrial undertaking in the Borough and discussed all aspects of the work which might affect the public or give potential opportunity for complaints. The matters investigated covered health aspects and traffic problens and the findings of the officers was the subject of a report to the Council More than 60 firms were visited and in every case discussions took place with senior executive or technical officers of the firms and a visit was paid to the plant itself Without exception we met with every courtesy and assistance and were given the fullest information. In general, there is no serious nuisance in the Borough from industry In almost every case, managements were fully alive to any potential nuisance from their works and were already taking steps to minimise or eliminate this many having spent large sums on special plant to eliminate nuisance. In a very few instances suggestions were made on possible further lines of action. In a handful of cases the nature of the materials used or the processes involved, make it impossible in the light of present technical knowledge - to prevent the escape, in some degree of dust or odour, etc. In some of these cases, there is at present no known practical method of eliminating the trouble but the firms are already taking the best known means of minimising the emission In a number of cases, research is also being carried out to find better methods of control. EXHAUST FUMES FROM DIESEL VEHICLES In October, 1959. following observation that Diesel engined vehicles proceeding through Qnoke Control Areas were sometimes polluting the atmosphere by the emission of heavy black smoke, the outside staff of my Department were asked to report details of any such vehicle observed to be emitting excessive smoke, so that the matter could be brought to the notice of the owners of the vehicles concerned. This practice had been successfully followed by the writer in his previous appointment since 1954 Since that date, six vehicles have been observed in the Borough to be emitting heavy black smoke and on each occasion the owners of the vehicle have been traced and written to, with a view to seeking their 53 co-operation by having the vehicle inspected and appropriate action taken, in order to eliminate pollution of the air At the same time the opportunity was taken of pointing out to the firm that it was in their own interest to have any defect in the vehicle remedied as the emission of black smoke represented wasted fuel. I am pleased to say that in all six instances the firms have been fully co operative in having the vehicle examined and the faults remedied. FACTORIES ACTS Every factory in the Borough was inspected at least once during the year and every possible step is taken to keep the register up- todate Changes in occupation, particularly of the smaller businesses, are frequent Notice of such changes are sometimes received from H. M. Inspector of Factories, who has a joint responsibility in factories where mechanical power is used Other changes are noted at the times of inspections by the Council's officers The position at the end of 1960 was as follows:- Factories with mechanical power 285 Factories without mechanical power 253 The following is a summary of industries and trades registered as factories in the Borough:- Antique Dealers 19 Boot Repairers 39 Cement Works and Road Surfacing Materials 7 Clothing (including Tailors Dressmakers, Shirtmakers and Bathing Costume Manufacturers) 27 Goal Wharf 1 Dyers and Cleaners 5 Dyers and Cleaners' Receiving Depots 32 Electricity Generating Station 1 Engineers: General 36 Electrical 22 Precision 17 Sheet Metal 10 Spraying 9 94 Exhibition Stand and Display Specialists 6 Pood (in all its branches - pie manufacturers butchers, etc,) 22 Garage (Services and Repairs) 44 Gas Works 1 Laboratories 4 Launderettes 9 Laundries 9 Laundry Receiving Depots 17 Oil Depots 5 Paint Manufacturer 1 Paper Bag and Cardboard Box Manufacturers 4 Photographers 2 Potteries 3 Printers: General 27 Silk Screen 4 3 1 Scrap Metal Merchants 10 Timber Merchants and Joiners 41 Warehouses, Wharfingers and Bonded Stores 26 Miscellaneous 78 538 54 The following is a record of inspections made and action taken:- Section 8 Premises v .

A. B. S. M. I. Mar. E. , BATHS SUPERINTENDENT) The Fulham Public Baths establishment comprises 3 swimming baths, 90 personal washing baths, and 2 Public Laundries. The swimming baths are respectively 75' x 25' - 100' x 30' - 125' x 35' They are filled from the Metropolitan Water Board mains, and from then on are purified by continuous pressure filtration, with a 4 hour turnover. Chlorine is used as a sterilising agent, and bacteriological tests are taken regularly, which show a high standard of purity commensurate with recommendations of the Ministry of Health. Once a year all baths are emptied for thorough cleaning. During the winter season two of the swimming baths are closed and floored over, being used for badminton, indoor bowls, table-tennis, meetings, dances etc. One swimming pool remains open all the year. The facilities in both the private warm baths, which includes showers, foam baths etc; and the Public Laundries, prove very popular and are used to capacity particularly at the weekends. 56 Section E Inspection and Supervision of flood Page Food, Examination 57 Food, Voluntary surrender 57 Milk 58 Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations 59 Food Standards (Ice Cream) Regulations 60 Sampling, Poods and Drugs 60 Adulterated or Irregular Samples and Pood subject of Complaint 60 Bacteriological Examination of Foodstuffs 65 Food Establishments, Inspection 66 Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955 66 Report of the Council's Public Analyst Thomas A.

EXAMINATION OF FOOD AND SEIZURE OF UNSOUND FOOD Certain articles of food which are liable to be adulterated are controlled by sampling and chemical analysis by the Public Analyst, but foods which deteriorate in quality and become unfit for human consumption are supervised by inspection and can be seized with subsequent condemnation by a Justice of the Peace and destruction. Voluntary Surrender of Food In practice shopkeepers rareiy attempt knowingly to sell to the public any foodstuff which is unfit for human consumption and it is customary for retailers who find food they have purchased from wholesalers to be unsound at the time they receive it or to have become unfit after storage on their premises to notify the local authority and request an inspection by the district public health inspector who if satisfied after examination that the food is unfit issues a certificate to that effect and arranges for its removal to and destruction at the Council' s Refuse Destructor. The surrender of foodstuffs from various depots and food premises during the year involved the examination and destruction of the following articles and the issue of 957 certificates:- Tinned and packeted goods 12, 307 Apricots 27 lbs. Bananas 5 cwts. Beef 160 lbs. Beef suet 154 lbs Biscuits 2 cases Chickens 114½ lbs Condiment 3 gallons Confectionery 43 lbs Crumpets 2 lbs. Eggs ¾ case Figs 29 lbs. Fish 24 stone Fruit 5 lbs.

Sausages 24 lbs. Vegetables 51 lbs. Winkles 1 cwt. Storm damged goods 730 lbs. \ 58 Sale of Milk Regulations 1939 The above Regulations state that where a sample of milk contains less than 3% of milk fat and less than 8 5% of solids not fat, until the contrary is proved the sample shall be deemed to be not genuine The following table sets out the monthly statement of the number of samples taken together with the percentage of fat and non fatty solids present These percentages show a slight increase on past years:- Month No of Average % Samples Fat Non-fatty solids January 6 3,73 8 70 February 5 3 58 8 70 March 9 3 56 8 69 April 6 3 54 8 75 May 9 3 55 8 77 June 5 3 48 8 64 July 4 3,49 8 55 August 6 3 62 8 68 September 2 3 65 8 71 October 5 3 80 8 77 November 3 3 93 8 86 December 9 3 84 8 75 Monthly Average 3 65 8 71 Milk and Dairies (Channel Islands and South Devon Milk) Regulations 1956 These Regulations prohibit the sale for human consumption of milk described as "Channel Islands", "Jersey", "Guernsey", or "South Devon" if it contains less than 4% milk fat. The following table shows the details of samples taken. Average % No. of samples Pat Non-fatty solids 29 4.40 9.02 In no case did a sample fall below the minimum of 4.0% milk fat and as with the samples listed in the earlier table, the figures show a slight increase in quality.

Number of Inspections of milk dealers premises 151 Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc ) Regulations 1959 Ingredients used in the manufacture of ice cream are required to be pasteurised or sterilised and thereafter kept at low temperature until the freezing process is begun As before, ice cream which has been allowed to reach a temperature exceeding 28°F must be heat treated again before sale. Exempted from the heat treatment requirements are water ices and ice lollies that are mixed before freezing and have a pH value of 4.5 or less. During the year, the trend towards the exclusive sale of wrapped ices continued Routine sampling has been carried out, and it is pleasing to report that every sample has reached the highest grade of cleanliness prescribed under the Regulations. Details of samples taken are as follows:- Wrapped "Loose" Total Ice Cream 33 5 38 Lollies 19 - 19 57 All samples reported in Grade 1. 60 The Food Standards (Ice Cream) Regulations 1959 The Regulations prescribe standards for ice cream and for "Parev" (kosher) ice and separate standards for dairy ice cream and for milk ice. The requirement that ice cream should contain not less than 10% of sugar is replaced by a provision that no type of ice cream shall contain any artificial sweetener. The standard of composition briefly stated is as follows: Ice Cream. Shall contain not less than 5% fat and 7½% milk solids other than fat. (Where ice cream contains any fruit, fruit pulp, etc the total fat and milk solids other than fat shall be not less than 12½% of the whole) Dairy Ice Cream. Shall contain not less than 5% milk fat and no other fat, and not less than 7½% milk solids other than fat (Where dairy ice cream contains any fruit, fruit pulp, etc. the total content of milk fat and milk solids other than fat, shall be not less than 12½% of the whole). Milk Ice (or milk ice containing any fruit, fruit pulp, etc.) shall contain not less than 2%% of milk fat and no other fat and not less than 7% milk solids other than fat. "Parev" or kosher ice shall contain not less than 10% fat and no milk fat or other derivative of milk. During the year a total of 43 samples of ice cream were obtained with the following results:- Commodity Average % Fat Non fatty solids Total solids Ice Cream 9.00 27 37 36. 37 Dairy Ice Cream 11.09 26 90 37 99 In no case did a sample fall below minimum requirements Food and Drugs Sampling Twenty-two complaints were received from members of the public regarding food, and these were fully investigated.

FOOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS 1955 AND 1960 On the 1st October. 1960, the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960, superseded the Pood Hygiene Regulations of 1955. The object was to extend the regulations to food businesses carried on from home going ships and moored vessels, and to extend and amend the earlier regulations in the light of experience gained, The operation of the regulations in relation to ships was postponed until 1st November, 1961. So far as the implementation of the regulations was concerned the policy of explanation and persuasion was again followed in a continuing effort to win the support of all food handlers in the cleanly handling of food at all stages. In only two cases was it decided to institute legal proceedings against offenders. 67 Date Legislation Offence Result 16.2.60 F.H.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ANALYST THOMAS McLACHLAN D.C.M A.C.G.F.C., F.R.I.C., M,I. Biol. During the year 1960, 800 samples of foods and drugs were examined. Of these 402 were taken formally and 398 informally. The number adult terated or about which some comment was made was 43. The incidence of complaint may be classified as follows:- Number of samples examined Number of samples adulterated, etc. Milk. 98 1 Other foods 698 42 Drugs 4 A sample of milk contained foreign matter which appeared to be essentially a mixture of clay with vegetable fibres. The bottle was clean except for the extraneous matter and it appeared that the contaminating material had probably gained access to the bottle after it had been filled. Three pieces of cheese were submitted because they possessed an objectionable odour, thought to be due to a type of weed eaten by animals in pasture. Examination showed that it was more likely to be due to bacteriological infection of the milk before it was processed for making the cheese. Some butter contained 16.3 per cent of water whereas under the Food and Drugs Act it must not contain more than 16 per cent of water. Two rolls and butter were reported as adulterated because they were spread with a mixture of butter and margarine, and a third sample submitted as a roll and butter was found to be spread with margarine only. Three loaves were received because they contained foreign matter. One contained a splinter of wood, thought to be from a bench, a sack filling machine, or some similar source a white loaf contained a piece of wholemeal bread which had probably been folded into the dough during moulding: and the third contained parts of an insect, possibly a bee, which appeared to have been present in the dough before the bread was cooked. A scone also contained foreign matter which consisted of general dirt and from the position of the dirt it had probably been picked up from the moulding board. 68 Four bun loaves were considered to be deficient in fruit. They contained respectively 6.1%, 6.4%, 6.7% and 6.0% of fruit. Two other bun loaves contained a satisfactory amount of fruit, but a stone was found in each loaf and the fruit had been improperly cleaned. A sample sold as flour was incorrectly labelled as it was in fact self-raising flour and must be sold as such. Some steak mince contained 1230 parts per million of sulphur dioxide and, therefore, contravened the provisions of the Preservatives, etc., in Food Regulations. A veal cutlet contained 93 per cent of meat, 6 per cent filler and 1 per cent water, the meat being minced, whereas a cutlet should be a cutlet of meat and not a pinced product. The lid from a can of corned beef was examined and from a pinhole puncture in the can lid it appeared to have been punctured after manufacture and resealed. Some chicken and ham paste was submitted as a complaint because it contained a dark mass. This consisted of a sugar coated ferrous sulphate tablet, and the tablet appeared to have gained access after the jar of paste had been opened. The presence of onion was declared on the label of some rollmop herrings with vegetables but no mention was made of the gherkin,chillie or other spices present. Rollmop herrings, when prepared, are not exampt from disclosure of their ingredients under the Labelling of Pood Order. Four samples of non-liquid soup were considered to be incorrectly labelled and, in the opinion of our analysts, should have been described as "Appetizer Soup". The made-up soup had only half the nutritive value of canned soup. Three samples of pure lemon juice were examined and all were fermenting. A blackcurrant vitamin C. syrup contained only 10 per cent of blackcurrant juice, and this quantity was considered to be insufficient to describe the product as a blackcurrant vitamin C. syrup. A blackcurrant health drink appeared to be correctly prepared, but it possessed a grey colour and was probably old stock. A grape and blackcurrant drink contained artificial flavour not disclosed on the label and therefore contravened the Labelling of Food Order. An ice fruit lolly was incorrectly labelled as containing "stabilizer" as an ingredient. A stabilizer must be declared by its correct scientific or other name. An orange spread was reported as inferior because it had an insipid and uninteresting flavour. A sample of prunes was reported as inferior because the 51 grams submitted contained a live maggot and an appreciable quantity of insect excrement. A sample of glace cherries were found to be fermenting. They contained 0.8 per cent alcohol and masses of viable yeasts. Two samples of mincemeat contravened the Pood Standards Preserves Order, 1953. They each contained 2.20 per cent of fat, whereas the Order requires 2.5 parts of fat. A sample of ground almonds smelled and tasted very rancid, although it did not respond to known chemical tests for rancidity. It was thought that the mixture probably contained debittered almonds which had been heated, some of the oil being polymerised during the 69 process, and consequently becoming rancid. A sample of parsley was reported as inferior because it contained ash 15.5 per cent and acid insoluble ash 2.5 per cent, indicating excess of earth. These figures are high because parsley is not like thyme, sage and marjoram, which grow more or less along the ground, but parsley grows to an appreciable height and should be freer from extraneous earth. A packet of tea was submitted as a complaint. When received the packet itself was damp and had a strong smell due to Dettol, T.C.P., or some similar antiseptic, which had passed through the wrapper into the tea. It was thought unlikely that the contamination could have occurred in the shop, and was more likely to have taken place in the purchaser's shopping bag. Some coffee contained a piece of phosphor bronze. The manufacturers were probably correct in suggesting that this had resulted from the resoldering of a boiling pan. A sample of whisky contained alcohol of proof strength of 54 per cent only, so that it contained not less than 47.7 per cent of added water, based on the fact that the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, Section 3 requires whisky to contain not less than 65 per cent proof spirit. In reality it probably contained not less than 50 per cent of added water. The advertisements for a "vinegar and honey mixture" contravened the Labelling of Food Order by making claims for vitamins and minerals without stating the quantities present. These were in fact negligible. A kettle and a sample of water boiled in it were submitted because a complainant stated that when water was boiled in the kettle the chalk precipitated was coloured blue. Examination showed that the water itself was also tinged slightly blue. The manufacturers had lacquered the interior of the kettle with a blue lacquer containing a blue colour not permitted in food. Food Legislation The year brought little change in food legislation, although the Pood Standards Committee issued two long reports, of which mention will be made later. The Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960, No, 1601, consolidated and amended the previous regulations. One amendment extends the regulations to cover the cleaning of food utensils and equipment, but it is remarkable that no regulations have yet been made to cover the material of which food handling utensils and equipment are made. Over many years attention has been drawn to the risk involved in using articles such as enamelware coated with antimony enamels and toasting prongs coated with lead, but it is still necessary to show that food stored in or treated with this equipment has been contaminated before any action can be taken. The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960, No. 1542, prescribe modifications of the existing Methylene blue test, provide a fresh Phosphatase test for pasteurised milk, and also provide a new test, the Clot-on Boiling Test for tuberculin tested milk. The Skimmed Milk with Non Milk Pat Regulations, 1960, No. 2331, cover fresh ground in food law inasmuch as they provide for the sale of milk, condensed milk, and dried milk, from which the original milk fat has been removed and replaced by other fats or oils. Pats and oils 70 used for this exchange are generally of vegetable origin and are intended primarily for persons suffering from coronary disease, and the reconstituted milk products are not to be used for babies. The Regulations are unfortunate in that they "do not apply to any food intended at the time of sale for export from the United Kingdom" , because certain foreign governments accept foods, which comply with the requirements of the British Food and Drugs Act to be admitted into their countries and accept the certificates either of any public analyst or of certain recognised public analysts to this effect. Any Regulations should, therefore, be so worded that they apply only to countries, where there are no restrictions. Another unfortunate provision in these regulations is that the labelling requirements do not apply to sales to catering or manufacturing businesses or to sales for immediate consumption. One would have thought that the casual consumer or eater-out is as much entitled to know what he is consuming as the purchaser buying a pre- packed food for use in the home. The Arsenic in Food (Amendment) Regulations, 1960, increase the amount of arsenic in brewers' yeast to be used in manufacture from 2.0 to 5.0 parts per million when calculated on the dry matter, but make no other alteration to the existing regulations, The Report of the Departmental Committee on "Milk Composition in the United Kingdom* occupies some 86 pages and makes 23 main recommendations, which may be summarised as follows:- (a) Milk should continue to be sold as it comes from the cow except for separated and other grades, which must be clearly labelled: (b) Efforts should be made to improve the quality of milk both with regard to fat and solids-not-fat, though the committee is more concerned about the solids-not-fat than the fat content: (c) The presumptive minimum standards should in five or ten years time become minimum legal standards for sale to the consumer: (d) The Hortvet Freezing test should be made legal subject to certain provisos: (e) Differential payment schemes should be introduced according to the quality of the milk: (f) Better provision should be made for the testing both of bulk and of individual cow milks. The Food Standards Committee Report on Bread and Flour occupies 19 pages and includes 24 general recommendations regarding flour and 10 regarding bread, but it also contains 51 pages of Appendices. The main provisions are that all flour required to be fortified at present should continue to be fortified for the present and that no change should be made in the quantities prescribed, that all sampling should be made at mills or docks, and that only certain bleaching and improving agents should be permitted. It is recommended that there should be a statutory list of ingredients permitted to be used in bread, that descriptions of "protein", "milk" and "slimming" breads should be controlled, and that exaggerated claims for enrichment or energyproducing qualities of bread should be prohibited.

In addition London University students studying for their Diploma in Health Education were instructed in the work of the Department with particular emphasis on health education activities. A party of 30 West German Local Government members and officers visited Fulham in June and were given talks to 'Local Government', 'Public Health' and 'Clean Air'. Discussion Groups and Talks: These were given on a variety of subjects, the talks dealing with all the varied aspects of the Department's activities. 5 Discussion Groups were held to a total audience of 73 persons. Average attendance 15. 25 Talks were given to a total audience of 707 persons. Average attendance 28. Film Shows: No. of shows 8. Total attendance 497 Average attendance 62. Press Publicity: The help received from the local press in giving publicity to all the various health education activities of the Department was greatly appreciated. Their co-operation in publishing articles, photographs, etc, was of tremendous value. 'Friends of Fulham Hospital' Carnival and Fete - 11th June, 1960 Continuing the practice of publicising a matter of topical Public Health importance, the Department entered a float with the House Fly and Its Dangers as its theme, which won the first prize in its class at this Carnival, A large model of a house fly was used as the centre piece and thanks are due to the boys and staff of Henry Compton School for their work in constructing the model, A photograph of the entry is on centre page The model has since been loaned to other local authorities for health exhibition purposes. Home Safety: (Section 82 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1957 Talks and Film Show 10 Talks on Home Safety were given to a total audience of 257. Average attendance 26 In addition a film show was arranged for members of an Old Age Pensioners' Club at which 265 persons attended. 77 Sketch at Open Air Theatre, Bishop's Park - August, 1960 This short sketch, written and acted by Town Hall staff, was very favourably received and was performed on six occasions before the normal public shows arranged by the Civic Recreation Department commenced. Mr, C. R, Davis, Divisional Superintendent of the St, John Ambulance Brigade, and members of the 133rd Fulham Division also took part The sketch was entitled "Living with Danger" and demonstrated the following hazards:- 1. Pan handles protruding over the edge of the stove. 2. The open oven door. 3. The insecurely stacked pans. 4. A bucket of hot water. 5. The overhanging tablecloth. 6. Teapot near the edge of table. 7. Chair with a broken rung. 8. Mirror over fireplace. 9. Fire without fireguard. 10. Long flex from the ceiling light, 11. Torn linoleum 12. Rumpled rug near the doorway. House of Hazards' Home Safety Competition for Children A "Home Safety" Competition for children was organised at the suggestion and with the assistance of Messrs. Smith & Nephew Ltd., manufacturers of first aid requisites. 45 entries were received for this competition which appeared in the "Fulham Chronicle" on the 5th August, The competitors were divided into two age groups, under 11 years, for which there were 19 entries, and 11 15 years, for which 26 entries were received. Each competitor had to spot the faults illustrated in an outline sketch of a domestic scene and then colour in the picture. The judges were Councillor J. J. Ireland, Chairman of the Accident Prevention Committee, Miss A. Prudhoe, Assistant Public Relations Officer, Smith & Nephew Ltd., Mr. Graham Barber of Messrs. Barber's Stores, Mr. L. Garratt, representing the Editor, "Fulham Chronicle", and Dr. C. A. Meade, Deputy Medical Officer of Health. First, second and third prizes, plus three consolation prizes were kindly provided for each group by Smith & Nephew Ltd., and were presented by The Worshipful the Mayor, Councillor Mrs. F, C. Pusey, J. P., at Messrs. Barber's Stores. Letters signed by Councillor J. J, Ireland were sent to all the competitors who failed to get a prize. The Home Safety Department of R.O.S.P.A, were informed of the competition and published a photograph of the Mayor presenting the prizes in their "Safety News" Bulletin. 78 L.C.C "Safety in the Home" Week - 31st October to 5th November: The Department co-operated in this special "Week" by displaying posters and distributing leaflets and bookmarks etc. The themes were the danger of falls and poisoning, which together account for some 75% of all fatal home accidents in England and Wales, "Lock Away Dangers in Your Home" Campaign - October to December, 1960 This was a national campaign organised by R.O.S.P.A (Home Safety Division). The Department participated by issuing press notices, distributing leaflets and displaying posters on Council and commercial sites. A display was erected in the foyer of the Department which proved quite attractive and was maintained for two weeks. A circular letter was sent to all Borough organisations enclosing literature and inviting them to apply for further information or have a talk on the subject A letter was also sent to all shops in the Borough selling or using poisons (Chemists, Ironmongers and Hairdressers) enclosing literature The circulars included copies of R.O.S.P.A 10-point Safety Plan consisting of simple safety rules which if generally adopted would prevent many a poisoning accident. Leaflets and Posters As usual these were widely used in connection with the various campaigns the principal sources of supply being Central Council of Health Education Ministry of Health and Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. A large display fixture is provided in the foyer of the Health Department offices on which 20 or more different leaflets and brochures can be displayed and from which the public are invited to "help themselves". Eight types of leaflet on the dangers of smoking were distributed from the dispenser, Seven of the leaflets were obtained from the Chest and Heart Association but one called "One out of Eleven" was obtained from the L.C.C. Supplies of this leaflet were sent to all Council Departments for distribution to staff and members of the public. MORTUARY ACCOMMODATION H.M. Coroner for West London having decided to centralise post mortem work at the Hammersmith Mortuary, the Fulham Mortuary became progressively less used. It was decided, therefore, to ask Hammersmith Borough Council to provide facilities for Fulham cases at their Mortuary, which was extended and modernised to cope with the increased admissions. This arrangement was approved by the L.C.C. in accordance with Section 237 of the Public Health (London) Act 1936, and operated from the 1st June 1960 Hammersmith Borough Council being paid an annual contribution in recognition of their services. 79 I am indebted to Dr. F. M. Day, Medical Officer of Health, Hammersmith, for details of the Fulham cases admitted to the Mortuary during 1960, as follows:- No. of cases admitted 227 (226 by order of the Coroner and 1 on application of Undertaker). No. of post-mortem examinations 226 No. of inquests held 41 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 Section 50 - Burial or cremation of the dead. 8 Funerals were arranged under the provisions of this section of the Act. Details of the cost of the burials are as follows:- £ s. d. 8 Funerals as per contract 148 9 0 Less amount recovered from estates of deceased, or by gifts, or responsible relatives 74 2 3 Balance, being cost to Council £ 74 6 9 PUBLIC CONVENIENCES With the opening of the new Ismailia Road Convenience a picture of which is on centre page, there are now 8 Conveniences in use under the control of the Public Health Department, each with a Men's and Women's Section. These have been constructed at various times between 1900 and 1960, All the conveniences have both a free and paid wash for the convenience of the public, the only exception being at Wyfold Road, where there is a free wash only. These facilities are well used and appreciated. New Conveniences Ismailia Road (Builders, W, J. Marston & Son Ltd.) opened to the public on the 11th June, 1960. A census taken of the use made of this convenience established that although the Men's Section is busy, the Women's is not. It has been decided, therefore, to vary the staffing of the Women's Section in order to effect economy. Gibbs Green (Replacement of existing underground convenience (built 1900) by a new convenience on site opposite) (Builders, Tersons Ltd.). Work commenced on the 8th August, and the convenience is expected to be ready for use in March, 1961. 80 Charger for Use: In September, the Council decided that although there would be a loss in revenue, it would be a progressive step for all W. C. accommodation in the public conveniences in the Borough to be provided free. Improved Lighting: During the year fluorescent lighting was installed at the Walham Green and Putney Bridge conveniences and before the end of March. 1961, the other conveniences requiring conversion (Lillie Road New King's Road and Effie Road) will also be improved. Letters of congratulation on the condition of the Fulham Public Conveniences are frequently received from persons living outside the Borough, and the installation of fluorescent lighting will have the effect of improving the existing high standard. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS During the year 123 medical examinations were carried out. These included the examination of new entrants to the Councils service, to determine their medical fitness for the post and their suitability for acceptance under the Superannuation Scheme Others were referred because of sick leave or accident. The latter usually required specialist investigation and this is done in collaboration with the patient's private doctor. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act regulates the sale of pet animals and empowers a local authority (in London a Metropolitan Borough) to grant licences to keep a pet shop on payment of a fee not exceeding ten shillings. During 1959 nine licences were renewed. No contraventions of the Act were found during 18 routine inspections. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT, 1933 The retail sale of poisonous substances by shopkeepers who are not registered pharmacists is controlled by the Act and Rules made thereunder. 81 The Poisons List, which has been prepared by the Poisons Board and confirmed by the Home Secretary, prescribes two Lists of Poisons Part I and Part II. The sale of poisons included in Part I is restricted to registered pharmacists whilst those included in Part II may be sold to the general public not only be registered pharmacists, but also (subject to certain conditions) by ordinary traders whose names are entered on a List of Persons entitled to sell such poisons, kept by the Local Authority, In April 1960, a new Poisons List Order amended the list of poisons contained in Part I and in the same month The Poisons Rules 1960, consolidated, amended, extended and revoked various Rules enacted between 1952 and 1958. The Acts and Rules lay down certain requirements regarding type of container, labelling, storage, transport and sale of poisons, penalties being prescribed for non-compliance, Fees are payable to the local authority by persons whose names are entered on the List. At the end of 1960 there were 148 names on the Council's List and the following changes took place in the Register during the year:- Number of listed sellers on Council's register at 1.1.60 153 Number added during the year 12 165 Number who transferred their business or discontinued the sale of poisons. 17 Number on register at 31.12.60 148 85 visits to listed premises were made during the year under review. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 Under this Act is is unlawful in the course of business to use filling materials to which the Act applies in any form of upholstery, the stuffing or lining of toys, baby carriages etc., except on premises registered by a local authority (in London, a Metropolitan Borough). It is also an offence to sell or expose for sale on any premises, any article containing filling material to which the Act applies, which is unclean. The standards of cleanliness for the various types of filling material are laid down in the Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Regulations, 1951-1954, At the beginning of the year there were six premises registered for the use of filling materials and during the year two new ones were added. At one premises the work of mattress making ceased, leaving seven registered premises at the end of the year. During the year samples were taken as follows: - 82 Type of Filling No of Samples Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Millpuff 3 3 - Feathers 4 2 2 Curled Hair 1 1 - Rag Flock 5 5 - Kapok 2 2 - Woollen Mixture Felt 1 1 - Cotton Felt 2 2 - Coir Fibre 2 2 - Total 20 18 2 The samples comprised 8 of filling material taken at registered premises and 12 of articles exposed for sale in shops. Two samples of feathers (Nos. 6/60 and 10/60) contained in pillows on sale in a retail shop were found to contain average total impurities of 2.3% and 2.4% respectively (permitted maximum is 2 0%). Legal proceedings were instituted against the retailer who was fined £2 and 2 guineas costs were awarded to the Council. FULHAM BOROUGH COUNCIL Town Hall, Fulham. S.W.6.
