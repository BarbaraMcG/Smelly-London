Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Annual Report for 1947. The health of the district was again satisfactory; the infectious disease rate was low, and there was no serious epidemic in the district, in spite of the fact that there was a somewhat severe epidemic of Anterior Poliomyelitis throughout the country. The work of the department has again been maintained at a high standard due to the efficient manner in which all members of the staff have carried out their respective duties and I welcome this opportunity of conveying to them my sincere thanks for their sustained efforts. I am, Your obedient servant, L. D. BAILEY, Medical Officer of Health. 4 MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE Medical Officers, Middlesex County Council : Northwood, Eastcote and Ruislip : Miss E. M.

It is gratifying to note that not a single case of Diphtheria was notified throughout the year. There was slight increase of Anterior Poliomyelitis in the District from July to December, nine cases in all, none of which fortunately proved fatal. At first sight it would appear that cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in the district have increased considerably from 37 to 63, but it must bo remembered that these cases are frequently changing their locality being admitted and discharged from Hospital and there is no doubt that the introduction of Mass Radiography has brought to light many cases which would otherwise have escaped detection. Smallpox : There were 110 eases of smallpox in this area during 1947. Scabies: Arrangements have been made with the Joint Isolation Hospital, Uxbridge, for the treatment of Scabies. Application for treatment must be made to this office in the first instance as no application will be accepted except on the recommendation of the Medical Officer of Health. 13 Water Supply : The whole of the district is supplied by the Colne Valley Water Company, with the exception of the following : Cottages in Field End Road, South Ruislip 4 Cottage, Rayson's Hill, Eastcote 1 5 Arrangements are in progress for the main supply to be brought to the Cottage, Rayson's Hill, Eastcote. Reports are received monthly from the Colne Valley Water Company as to the chemical and bacteriological examination of samples of water, and these have proved satisfactory in every case. Bathing Establishments — Ruislip Lido. Samples of water have been taken throughout the year which have proved satisfactory, thus justifying in full the labour and expense involved in the provision of the Chlorinating Plant and Boat mentioned in my report for 1946. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE The whole of the soil sewers in the Council's area discharge into the sewers of the West Middlesex Drainage Scheme. FACTORIES AND OUTWORKERS During the year the Sanitary Inspectors made 47 visits to factories and 14 to outworkers' premises. No serious defects were found, but in many cases improvements were carried out. INFESTATION DEPARTMENT Throughout the year the Rodent Control Section of the Public Health Department continued to operate. Investigation and disinfestation have been carried out at business premises, private dwellings, Council property and refuse tips, which involved 7718 visits. The sewers have been treated by means of a test bait, but no trace of rats in the manholes has been found. 14 SANITARY INSPECTION OF DISTRICT Public Health Act, etc.: Visits Houses inspected for nuisances 1170 Offices and Business Premises 10 Verminous Premises 76 Caravans 55 Hutment Dwellings — Ponds, ditches, watercourses, insects, etc. 44 Ruislip Lido, visits and water sampling 28 Animals, pigs, poultry, etc. 63 Yards, passages and footpaths and car parks 111 Other nuisances 139 Water supplies 56 Drainage inspected or tested 1038 Infectious disease general enquiries 167 Hospital discharges 23 Food poisoning enquiries 30 Schools 8 Camping Sites 34 Premises visited for Middlesex County Council for Music and Dancing Licences 21 Cinemas, general visits 16 Smoke nuisances 16 Paddling Pools, recreation grounds, samples 51 18 Hawkers' registrations 23 Housing Acts: Houses, inspections, etc 181 Houses, measured re Land Registry Searches 865 Premises visited re Building Licences 122 Food and Drugs Act : Foodshops and cafes 89 Bakehouses 11 Unsound food 359 Fish shops 72 Cowsheds and Dairies 9 Food delivery vehicles 1 Milk sampling 8 Ice-cream sampling 56 Shops Acts: Premises visited 12 Factory Acts: Premises visits 47 Outworkers visits 14 Petroleum Acts: Premises visited 25 Riding Establishment Acts: Visits and enquiries 10 Council Houses : Houses inspections 11 Requisitioned Houses: Houses visited 20 Miscellaneous and General Enquiries 248 Premises visited re dustbins 255 Infestation Order Rats and Mice: Visits to Premises by Sanitary Inspectors 5 Rodent Officer 761 Rodent Operatives 6957 Premises disinfected 70 Bedding and Clothing steam disinfected 71 Informal action 371 Nuisances abated 295 Drainage unstopped—premises affected 718 15 PRINTED AT RAWLINSONS NORTHWOOD
