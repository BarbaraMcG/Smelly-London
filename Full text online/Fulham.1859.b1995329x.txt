FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT. Pursuant to the 198th section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, the Board of Works for the Fulham District present to their Constituents the Fourth General Report of their proceedings. During the past year they have obtained from the Public Works Loan Commissioners the third instalment of the Loan referred to in their former Report, viz., £,5000, and with which they have been enabled to carry-out permanent Works as follows:— hammersmith parish: Fulham-road, between Queen - street and tlie Parish Boundary, paved and curbed, in length about Feet. 1030 Black Lion Lane, east side, paved and curbed 600 Part of north side of New-road, paved 2400 4030 fuliham parish: London-road, from Fulham Town to Walham Green, paved, about 4750 Parson's Green Lane, paved 1780 From Walham Green to Stamford Bridge, south side, paved 1900 Church-street, paved 280 8710 The Board have reason to believe that the above works of improvement, so much needed, have afforded general satisfaction ; and it gives them pleasure to state that the rates will not be materially increased thereby. So far as they have been able to ascertain, the estimates for the ensuing year will not exceed those of former years, although they will include the re-payment of one twentieth part of the whole loan and interest. The Board have had under further notice the drainage of the two parishes; and considering that no plan of general benefit could 4 be carried-out until the main trunk Lines and outlets were constructed, they urged upon the Metropolitan Board of Works the necessity of commencing the main drainage of the district, and are happy to report successfully in so far as concerns the northern part of the parish of Hammersmith. The Acton line of sewer, now constructing along the Uxbridgeroad is of capacious size, and will afford an efficient outlet for the sewerage of that part of the parish of Hammersmith north of the Gold-Hawk-road; and, as it has ever formed a part of the Intercepting Scheme of the Metropolitan Board of Works, the payment of cost of construction will be metropolitan and not local: thus, at a mere nominal charge, the inhabitants of that increasingly populous district will have the means of removing numerous nuisances and of being provided with the most ample house drainage. The sewage, also, from Woodstock-road and Richmond-terrace will be diverted from the open ditches and extensive morass abutting on Shepherd's-Bush-road, and that flowing from a considerable portion of Shepherd's-Bush to the same places will be intercepted. The local drainage works which have been constructed from Blythe House and Messrs. Macalpine's Factory have also diverted the sewage from the said morass, so that it may be anticipated that this place locally known as the "Dismal Swamp," from which much reasonable apprehension of danger to public health has arisen, will occasion no further trouble in that respect. The Board refer with satisfaction to the improved sanitary condition of the district under their jurisdiction: the deaths therein have been below the number of those of last year proving, as they believe, that their earnest and persevering efforts for the removal of nuisances, and the means taken to prevent their recurrence, have had a most beneficial effect. During the past year 599 cases of nuisance have been removed, as shewn in the analysis as follows:— Privies and cesspools emptied, &c 258 Drains and gullies cleansed, repaired, &c. 106 Houses cleansed and repaired . 74 Pig cases removed 56 Dust-bins made 25 Miscellaneous 80 599 Houses benefited in Fulham by the removal of such nuisances 236 „ Hammersmith 293 529 5 By means of the Sanitary Committee the Board exercise a careful and vigilant supervision over the slaughter-houses within the district, and much benefit has arisen from the regulations now enforced by the Board and Justices in Petty Sessions. Notices of 31 applications for licenses to slaughter-houses were received, none of which it was considered necessary to oppose, and the whole were consequently granted by the Magistrates. With reference to the debts charged on the parish of Fulham, the Board stated in a memorial to the Metropolitan Board of Works so far back as the 20th October, 1856— "That the sum of £8,127 14s. 7d apportioned on Fulham is "for the cost of works constructed in other places, and that no ."part thereof has been expended in Fulham in the construction of "any sewer therein : and that, therefore, it would be manifestly an " act of injustice to call upon that parish for the contribution of one " farthing towards the payment thereof." And subsequently when opportunity has offered, the Board have reiterated in effect the above statement, and called upon the Metropolitan Board to seek of Parliament power to re-distribute those debts in a more equitable manner. It is but justice to the Metropolitan Board to state that they have regarded the case of Fulham as peculiar; and that, having felt the force of facts brought under their notice, they have, in a Bill to amend the Metropolis Local Management Act, proposed a re-distribution of these said debts,—relieving Fulham to the amount of upwards of £7,000. As intimated in their Second General Report, the Board have had to defend an action brought against them by Mr. F. Scott, relating to the swing gate placed on the footpath leading from the GoldHawk-road to the Uxbridge-road; they regret to state that the result has been adverse to the Board, and that Mr. F. Scott has obtained a perpetual injunction restraining the Board from interfering with such gate. An abstract of the several contracts entered into by the Board during the past year is appended; also, in pursuance of the 198th section of the Act, an abstract of accounts, duly audited, showing the receipts and expenditure for the same period; the report of the Medical Officer of Health; and a list of the names and addresses of the members of the Board and its officers. abstract of contracts entered into by the board during the year ending 25th march, 1860: Mr. Coat, for paving and masonry works, at certain prices set forth in the schedule, and embodied in the contract.

Gentlemen, After a lapse of four years, devoted to the prevention and removal of conditions prejudicial to health, it is due from sanitary science that we should be able to show some marked and tangible evidence of its effects on the people, but in proportion to the facilities, natural or otherwise, available for the purpose, so must the results be commensurately anticipated, and estimated when realized. In a District situate at an advantageous level, and more or less supplied with the opportunity for carrying-out effective house drainage, we should cæteris paribus expect a far greater change in the social state than where the opposite circumstances prevail. In reviewing our own position on the sanitary ladder, we must not lose sight of these important elements of success. The non-existence of effective outlets must ever operate (however great the labour bestowed) in retarding the progress of sanitary improvements, and however favourable other conditions may be, this radical defect will assuredly and most unerringly influence the well-being of any community subjected to it. A large proportion of the Fulham District is thus circumstanced, and the efforts of the Sanitary Committee have consequently been much impeded, and, indeed, the duties of your Officers thus indefinitely multiplied. Palliatives of an evanescent character have been applied instead of effectual remedies, and constantly recurring nuisances have taken place where it would have been more profitable to all finally to have obliterated them. It would be easy to point to instances within our area of every possible disadvantage arising from the absence of this first great fulcrum on which all permanent improvement turns, but we may also look with 9 tion on many equally demonstrative of the desired favourable conditions. In reviewing the sanitary history of the past year we must consider how much we have progressed in the removal of those natural conditions prejudicial to health, and how far we have curbed or removed those incidental to operations of a social nature, as also to what extent we have added to our sanitary appliances. In a word how many open offensive ditches have been covered over, cleansed or removed; how many effective sewers and drains have been constructed, and how far those already in existence have been rendered available for our purpose. To what extent have we prevented the pollution of the air by effluvia from noxious trades, and improved the purity of our dwellings by increased cleanliness within them. The records of the Sanitary Committee show the number of works accomplished, and are given in the general report of the Board. The main-drainage scheme proceeds so slowly that little can be said of sewers constructed save that now in hand at Shepherd's Bush, whilst the absence of power to enforce a water supply for domestic purposes yet remains an opprobrium to the statute book. water supply. In any effort to improve the sanitary condition of the dwellings of the poor especially, not only water, but a good supply of it is an indispensable necessary. Without this adjunct no effectual trapping and panning of closets or flushing of drains can be accomplished, whilst it is equally essential for preserving the healthful state of the houses and the occupants themselves. Many cases could be enumerated where the absence of an efficient water supply has completely defeated the permanency of all other sanitary improvements ; the traps to privies and drains are rendered in-operative, and the pipes become speedily blocked with solid soil. The removal of the nuisance arising from that ultra-abomination known as the "Dismal Swamp" will be hailed with satisfaction by all. The refuse from the extensive Laundry and Bleaching Factory of Messrs. Macalpine in Blythe Lane has been diverted from it, whilst the drainage from Shepherd's Bush will in future be satisfactorily effected by the new sewer in the Uxbridge Road. offensive trades. Amongst the offensive trades which have been carried on around us, the keeping of Pigs stands prominently forward. The population however has now so much increased that it is necessary our District should no longer be made unwholesome merely on account of its contiguity to richer and more luxurious parishes, to whom the removal of the inconvertible refuse is solely a question of cost. Hitherto this has been accomplished without expense to the pro- 10 ducers, because the feeding of these animals thus near to the supply has offered a profitable employment to those engaged in its gratuitous collection, and because until the constitution of your Board as a sanitary supervisor no impediment of consequence was offered to the corruption of the air by the boiling of offensive offal and the pollution of our open ditches by the drainage of extensive piggeries. During the past year several prohibitory Magisterial orders have been obtained against persons keeping Pigs in improper places. removal of domestic refuse. The speedy and regular removal of domestic refuse is an equally important sanitary requirement, and yet there is perhaps none where greater difficulty has been experienced in effecting it in this District. However well the Contractor may be disposed to carry-out the stipulation he has agreed to, he is greatly at the mercy of the men employed by him. It generally happens, too, that the persons who enter into these engagements with the Local Authorities are engaged in other branches of trade requiring the plant necessary for carrying into effect a contract of this kind, and hence it is much to be feared that the collection of the refuse is made subservient to the other more profitable employment of it. The men engaged are fully aware of their irresponsibilty to the Vestries and District Boards, and that their officers have no direct authority over them, and hence the numerous complaints which continually inundate the Office with reference to this subject. The time will come when the authorities must take this matter into their own hands, and although it might probably form an item of direct expenditure it will not be without its indirect advantages. sickness returns. By the kind consideration of the Board of Guardians and the Committee of the West London Hospital I have been enabled through the past year to ascertain every week the exact amount of pauper sickness prevailing in the District, and thereby to take prompt measures for checking as far as possible the progress of any special malady. This facility has been of vital importance particularly with regard to cases of Small Pox which have occurred at intervals. It gives me an opportunity also of observing what class of disease may be incidental to particular localities: thus, of 97 cases of Diarrhoea recorded in Fulham under the Union Medical Officers, 41 occurred in the immediate neighbourhood of North End, 21 in that of Walham Green, and 22 in Fulham Fields. Of 40 cases of Diarrhoea in Hammersmith 21 occurred in or near the Rookery and Slater's Buildings, as also did 4 of English Cholera. Of 10 cases of Fever recorded in Fulham 5 occurred in Crown-street and Parson's Green; and of 19 cases in Hammersmith G occurred in the Rookery, &c., and 10 in the neighbourhood of South-street 11 and the High Bridge. Again, of 29 cases of Scarlatina in Fulham, 28 occurred at North End; whilst of 30 cases of this disease in Hammersmith, 12 happened in or near Queen-street and the Broadway, G at the Rookery, and 6 in the neighbourhood of South-street. Of 8 cases of Small Pox in Fulham, 4 occurred at Walham Green and 1 near Sun-street. Several cases of this disease have been observed in Hammersmith, of which many occurred in or near South-street, but isolated cases have been noted in almost every other part of the parish. The West London Hospital returns show that 12 cases of Small Pox have presented themselves at that Institution during the year, 5G of Measles, 27 of Scarlatina, 10 of Whooping-Cough, 214 of Diarrhoea, 4 of Ague, and 28 of Fever. mortality. The total number of Deaths registered during the year in the District has been 751, of which 426 arose in Hammersmith and 325 in Fulham. 63 persons have died in the Union House, 13 in Lunatic Asylums, 12 in Roman Catholic Institutions, and 5 in AimsHouses. 32 Inquests have been held within the District. Of the 751 deaths, 265 had not reached their 3rd year, and 297 had not attained their 5th year, whilst 109 had arrived at 70 years and upwards ; 73 persons died between 70 and 80 years, 32 between 80 and 90 years, and 4 at 90 and upwards. Of deaths from diseases of an epidemic character, 3 were contributed by Small Pox, 31 by Measles, 29 by Scarlatina, 6 from Diptheria, 11 from Whooping-Cough, 9 from Fever, and 34 from Diarrhoea. 89 have died from Pulmonary Consumption. births. The number of Births registered during the year has been 1118, showing an excess of births over deaths of 367. meteorology. The Meteorology of the year has been characterized with a heavy rain-fall and great vicissitudes of temperature. On the morning of Friday, April 1st, the thermometer fell to 24.2, and rose on the 7th at 2 p.m. to 92 0 in the sun, showing a range of 678. A considerable quantity of snow fell on the two last days of March. The temperature attained its maximum height on July 12th and 18th, on both of which days it stood at 87.0 in the shade. The latter parts of October and the beginning of November were unusually severe, though attended with great fluctuation of the thermometer. On the 6th November, for instance, the minimum 12 temperature was 55.7 and the maximum 59.0, showing a range of only 3.3, whilst on the 15th of the same month the minimum was 22.1 with a maximum of 41.0, a range of 18.9. On the 19th December the temperature fell to 16.5 and did not rise beyond 30.1 during the day, and on the following day it again descended to 16.0. (The minimum temperature of January 1st, 1860, was only 51.7.) OZONE. The observations on ozone through the year fully corroborate my previous experience of the deoxidizing influence of London air over that of our District. that of our District. This was specially marked during the eight days ending March 13th, as shown below, according to a scale registering 0 to 10. Days. Wind. Ozone. March 6th W. 4 „ 7th s. w. 4 „ 8th w. 9 „ 9th N. W.
