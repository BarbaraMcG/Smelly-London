ANNUAL REPORT, 1876. In compliance with the requirements of the Metropolis Management Act, the Board present to the Parishioners their Annual Report, comprising the Works commenced and completed, and those in progress ; the proceedings for the Removal of Nuisances, the improvement of the Sanitary Condition of the District; the Reports of the Medical Officer of Health, and of the Analyst under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, and abstracts and summaries of the Annual Accounts. The following Meetings have been held during the year commencing June, 1875, and ending May, 1876:- Board Meetings 34 Finance Committee Meetings 18 Works Committee „ 14 Sanitary Committee „ 11 Special Committees on various subjects 10 In all . 87 Accounts. The Accounts of the Board are annexed to this Report. On perusal it will be seen that the large payments to the Metropolitan Board of Works and the London School Board, for which precepts were made on this District, amounted as follows:- For the Metropolitan Consolidated Rate (including therein Main Drainage, Fire Brigade, Sinking Fund, and General Expenses), the sum of £6,751 15 4 The School Board for London 3,953 0 2 Making together . £10,704 15 6 8 And being more than one-third of the whole of the expenditure of the Board. lhe following table shows the several amounts paid oy tnis District to the Metropolitan Board of Works for the last nine years:— Year. Amount. £ s. d. 1867-8 7,328 12 10 1868-9 6,297 8 5 1869-70 6,303 4 0 1870-1 6,648 13 10 1871-2 4,308 14 4 1872-3 3,244 0 10 1873-4- 3,434 16 0 1874-5 5,605 13 8 1875-6 6,751 15 4 The precept for the year 1876-7 amounts to £6,417 3s. 6d., nearly a fifth part of the annual expenditure of this Board. The amounts paid by this District to the London School Board since it was constituted are as follow:— Year. Amount. £ s. d. 1871 719 11 9 1872 1,208 8 10 1873 939 15 11 1874 2,348 5 1 1875 3,953 0 2 The precept for the present year amounts to £5,744 7s. ad., being a rate exceeding 4d. in the £. Notwithstanding the many remonstrances against the lavish expenditure of the School Board since the year 1873, and the extreme dissatisfaction expressed by the Ratepayers in all parts of the Metropolis, and the Deputations to the Council on Education, the London School Board continued not only to pursue a like course of extravagance, but to increase it, and by the Report of its Statistical Committee, it appears that at the end of its financial year, it had • not only spent the enormous sum of £263,713 lis. 5d., for which precepts had been issued in the past year, but there was an excess expenditure of no less a sum than £69,245 15s. 5d., and without any hesitation precepts were issued to the several Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis for payment, not only of the last mentioned sum, but of further sums required, amounting in the whole to £398,867. A great outcry in the Metropolis followed, and amongst other authorities that of the Westminster District Board of Works immediately proceeded to pass strong resolutions condemning these proceedings, and to convene a Meeting of all the Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards, of which twenty-five of 9 those authorities sent their Delegates to such Meeting, who, after duly deliberating, unanimously resolved as follows:— "1. That it be recommended to the various Rating Authorities, and to the Ratepayers, that it is advisable to call Meetings in their respective localities to draw attention to the present action and policy of the London School Board, and to combine in the several divisions and agree to support Candidates who will pledge their word to economy and endeavour to keep the expenditure within a rate not exceeding 3d. in the £ per annum, as originally contemplated. "2. That a Deputation be appointed to wait on the Premier to urge the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the working of the Elementary Education Act. "3. That the Rating Authorities of the Metropolis be requested to petition Parliament to appoint a Royal Commission to enquire into the carrying out of the Elementary Education Act, more especially with regard to the rapidly increasing expenditure of the London School Board." The Election of Members of that Board will take place in the month of November next. This Board would call the attention of the Parishioners to the fact that there is no control over or appeal against the Expenditure of the Metropolitan Board of Works or the London School Board. The Decease of Members. The Board sincerely regret to announce the deaths of Thomas Bellamy, Esq., Mr. Thomas Burden, and Mr. Thomas Simmons, late Members of this Board. Mr. Bellamy was unanimously called on to preside at the first Meeting of this Board at its Constitution in 1855, and continued for many years to take an active and beneficial interest in its proceedings. Mr. Simmons was elected Member at the same time as Mr. Bellamy, and from that date to within a short time before his decease, a period extending over twenty-one years, he took a most active and disinterested part in the duties of his office. Mr. Burden became a Member in the year 1871, and assisted in the duties of his office till his death. The Board cannot forbear to express their sense of the loss the Parishioners have sustained by the decease of those gentlemen. Medical Officer of Health. The sudden death, in the month of September last, of Dr. George Ross, the late Medical Officer of Health, was seriously felt in this District. His great experience, coupled with the very able and judicious manner in which he uniformly and most successfully discharged the duties of his responsible office (to which he was appointed in the year 1869), was duly appreciated by the Board, and in the District. The Board, shortly after Dr. Ross' decease, appointed Dr. Samuel Robert Lovett, of Great Russell Street, his successor, believing him to be thoroughly qualified to discharge successfully the duties of that important office, at a salary of £150 per annum. 10 Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875. This Act was, as is generally known, passed to enable the Local Authority (which in London, excepting the City, is the Metropolitan Board of Works), with the consent of Parliament and the Home Secretary, to carry into effect schemes for the re-arrangement and re-construction of the Streets and Houses of close, narrow, and badly arranged districts, partly indicated by a low condition of health, as being unfit for human habitation. Under this Act the late Dr. Ross, as Medical Officer of Health of this Board, proposed to officially represent that certain Houses, Courts, and Alleys comprised within the area bounded by Great Queen Street and Wild Court on the North ; Chapel Place and King's Head Yard on the Northeast ; Princes Street and Duke Street on the South-east, and Drury Lane on the South-west, and known as the Great Wild Street District, were an unhealthy area within the meaning of this Act, and that the powers of the Act ought to be applied to remedy the evils existing therein ; but his decease, in the month of September last, delayed the proceedings. Dr. Lovett, his successor in office, applied himself to the subject, and made an official representation to the Local Authority. A Special Committee of that Board, attended by several Members of this Board, in the month of March last, carefully inspected the locality, and the subject is, at the date of this Report, under the consideration of the Metropolitan Board as the Local Authority. Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868. The Board have continued their endeavours to enforce this Act, with the view of improving the condition of the dwellings of the poorer classes in this District, and orders for that purpose have been made in respect of houses in Monmouth Court, Neals Yard, and Tower Street, which are in course of prosecution. Notwithstanding these efforts there are portions of the District in which, by reason of the narrowness of the Streets and Courts, and the limited space on which the present dwellings were erected a century ago, the sanitary evils now existing can alone be remedied by the application of the provisions of the Artizans' Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875. Much, however, yet remains to be done towards rendering the close and densely populated portions of the District healthy. The inhabitants thereof are for the most part low Irish, and to introduce, cultivate, and enforce habits of cleanliness and sobriety amongst them is very difficult. Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875. The Adulteration Acts of 1860 and 1872 have been repealed, and the above Act, by the passing whereof very considerable 11 ations have been made in the law relating to the adulteration of food, drink, and drugs—heavy penalties are imposed on persons mixing injurious ingredients and selling the same, as also on persons selling any article which is not of the nature, substance, and quality demanded by the Purchaser, provided that no offence shall be deemed to have been committed if at the time of delivery of such article a notice is delivered to the purchaser by a label legibly printed, to the effect that the same is mixed. There are rather special regulations the Purchaser must pursue should he desire to have the article analysed. But, on the whole, the Act is considered to be an improvement in the law ; one new and important feature being that the penalties imposed by the Act are, in cases of prosecutions by the Vestries and District Boards, ordered to be paid to those Authorities, to be applied in liquidation of the expenses of such prosecutions. Under this Act, Dr. Redwood, of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, has been re-appointed the Analyst for the District of this Board. There have been 206 cases of analysis during the year. Proceedings were taken in 11 cases, and convictions obtained. The fines and costs imposed in such cases amounted to £26. 19s. 6c/. It is to be observed that the number of analysis cases, convictions, and fines is less than last year, owing to the alterations in the law being under the consideration of Parliament during a part of the period, and to time being required to make the necessary arrangements for carrying out the new law. Annexed to this Report will be found that of the Analyst for the past year. Sanitary Acts. There have been several cases of prosecutions under these Acts, and in all cases orders have been made by the Magistrates for the abatement of the nuisances complained of. In some instances the Board have, under the powers given by the Acts, entered on the premises and performed the work directed by the Magistrates, and recovered the costs of the same from the owners. Wood Pavements. Several applications, by residents in the District, having been made to the Board to lay down Wood Pavements in their Streets, the Board, after much consideration, on account of the increased cost of such work, and to there being no satisfactory datd of the best and most durable pavement, determined to try three of those most approved, and accordingly have caused the following Streets to be paved with wood, viz.: the west side of Bloomsbury Square, consisting of 1,048 yards, by the Improved Wood Pavement Company Limited, at a cost of 14s. 6d. per yard; a portion of Hart Street, from New Oxford Street to Bury Place, by the Asphaltic Wood Pavement Company Limited, consisting of 12 1,131 yards, at a cost of 14s. 6c/. per yard ; and a part of High Street, St. Giles, consisting of 648 yards, by Messrs. John Mowlem & Co., at a cost of 14s. 6 c/. per yard, the several contractors agreeing to keep their several pavements in repair, free of cost to the Board, for a period of three years from the completion of the work, and thereafter, for twelve years, at a cost of Is. and Is. 6c/. per square yard. The Board consider that at least five years should be allowed to elapse to enable it to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion as to which of the several Wood pavements should be adopted as the best. Gas. The Metropolitan Board of Works, during the Session 1874-5, had three Bills before Parliament relating to the Gas Supply of the Metropolis:— 1. To establish Independent Gas Works. 2. To Purchase the Undertakings of the existing Gas Companies. 3. To amend the Metropolis Gas Acts. The first two of these Bills were withdrawn, the third passed a second reading in the House of Commons, and was referred to a Select Committee, which was presided over by Mr. Forster. This Committee, at the suggestion of the Board of Trade, recommended to the House the adoption of a sliding scale dividend inversely to the price of Gas. That the initial price should be 3s. 9d. per 1,000 cubic feet for 16-candle Gas; and that the dividends of the Companies should decrease or increase at the rate of 5s. per cent, for every penny of increase or decrease in price. Owing, however, to the lateness in the Session when the Committee reported the Bill, it did not reach a third reading, and so was lost for the Session. During the present Session the Bill, as settled by the above Committee, was again introduced into the House of Commons ; it passed a second reading, and was referred to a Select Committee. This Committee has not yet, however, been appointed, and it is not considered probable that the Bill will be further proceeded with. Recently a scheme of amalgamation has been agreed to, and has received the Royal Assent, between the Gas Light and Coke Company (usually known as the " Chartered"), the Independent Gas Company, and the Imperial Gas Company ; the last named Company lights a considerable portion of this District. Subsequently terms were arranged between the Amalgamated Company and the Metropolitan Board of Works, under the superintendence of the Board of Trade, and a Bill introduced into Parliament by the Company for farther powers was amended in conformity therewith, these terms being the same as those recommended by Mr. Forster's Committee. This Bill has passed the House of Commons, and is now before the House of Lords awaiting a second 13 reading, and inasmuch as there is practically no opposition to the Bill on its merits, it is considered pretty certain to become law. The London Gas Company, which lights the remaining portion of this District, has also agreed to certain terms proposed by the Board of Trade. These are practically the same as those contained in the Gas Light and Coke Company's Bill, and the Board of Trade is preparing a Bill for Parliament embodying them, which will doubtless pass the Legislature and become law. Tottenham Court Road. At the south-west end of Tottenham Court Road is a narrow and ill-ventilated Court, called Bosiers Court, consisting, until recently, of very old and dilapidated Houses ; those fronting on Oxford Street needing to be pulled down. The Inhabitants of the immediate neighbourhood memorialized this Board to join with the adjoining Parishes of St. Marylebone, St. Pancras, and St. Ann's, Soho, in purchasing the east side of the Court, pulling down the Houses, and appropriating the space to widening Tottenham Court Road, the traffic at this spot—the j unction of three great thoroughfares—being at all times very great. Accordingly, this Board proposed to the Metropolitan Board of Works to purchase the property in question, and appropriate the ground whereon it stands to the purposes above mentioned. The adjoining Parishes made similar applications. The Metropolitan Board, however, declined to assent to the proposal, alleging that the plan was not a Metropolitan improvement; but offered to contribute one-half of the cost of the same, providing the above mentioned parishes and this Board undertook to bear the other half. Thereupon memorials were presented by their several Parishes and this Board, and a deputation, consisting of members from the same, attended the Metropolitan Board, and urged it to bear the entire cost of purchase, on the ground, amongst others, that this Board has no power to take property out of its District for improvements. No formal resolution has been communicated by that Board, but as it was believed that it would decline to alter its previous decision, the subject was allowed to stand over in case any fresh circumstances should arise, and induce the parishes again to bring the subject under the consideration of that Board. Since then, the old buildings have been taken down, and the site built on. THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR Abstract of Receipts and Payments of the above Board, for GENERAL RECEIPTS. £ s. d. Ledger. £ s. d.

Great Russell Street has since been paved during the current year, and will be referred to in the next annual report, but Chenies Mews, as the Board is aware, has been indefinitely postponed. In compliance with the order of the Board of the 23rd February, 1875, a Steam Roller was used experimentally in ramming the new granite paving in Broad Street, the result was not satisfactory, and hand ramming was resorted to in all subsequent works. The following Macadamized Roadways were repaired with broken Guernsey Granite, Steam Rollers being in all cases used to consolidate the granite after being spread:- Bedford Square (East Side, and por- Chenies Street tions of North, South, and West Sides) Brunswick Square Russell Square (portions of North, South, and West Sides) Montague Place- Woburn Mews West (entrance to). A Bedford Place horse roller was employed here Various isolated repairs to other macadamized roads were made during the season, at which rollers were not used. New Sewers. The principal Sewer Works carried out during the past year were the construction of new Sewers in Vernon Place, the South and East sides of Bloomsbury Square, Great Russell Street, from Bloomsbury Street to Caroline Street, Duke Street, and Great Queen Street^ the total length of Sewer constructed being about 2,076 feet. 27 Street Cleansing. A staff of Street Orderlies employed by the Board has been constantly engaged during the year in sweeping the public ways of the District. The slop and dirt have been carted away by contract. Two Street Sweeping Machines have been purchased by the Board; they commenced work on the 30th September last, and have been of great assistance in cleansing the Streets. They are drawn by horses, hired by the Board at an agreed price, which includes all risks to the horses, their feed, and the services of one driver. The Board has also employed a Scavenging Foreman, whose sole duty it is (under your Surveyor and Street Inspector) to superintend all works of Street cleansing and watering and the removal of dust: he commenced his duties on the 24th September last, and the results of his supervision have been very satisfactory. The recent winter has been an exceptionally long and severe one. There has been a considerable amount of rain, and on twenty-one days snow has fallen in larger or smaller quantities. On seven occasions the snow-fall was heavy, and the badness of the season generally rendered the Street cleansing a work of considerable labour and difficulty. The snow removed from the public ways as snow during the season was as follows:—After the snow-fall on the 2nd December, 1875, 112 loads; 8th December, 1875,234 loads; 11th January, 1876,8 loads; 13th January, 1876, 229 loads; 13th February, 1876, 146 loads; 22nd March, 1876, 58 loads; or a total of 787 loads of snow. The total quantity of Street Sweepings and Slop (including Snow) carted away during the half year ending 25th March, 1876, was 6,623 loads—the quantity removed during the half-year to 25th March, 1875, was 4,489 loads—there being, therefore, nearly fifty per cent. more stuff removed in the six months just ended than in the corresponding period in the previous year. This gives strong evidence of the usefulness of the Horse Sweeping Machines, and the badness of the weather. The whole of the snow removed was carted at once away from the District. It was, at one time, the intention to deposit the Snow from the main thoroughfares, in the first instance, in some of the squares and open spaces in the District, but a magisterial decision being given against a neighbouring Vestry for doing so in its Parish, it was thought best to remove it at once away from your District. This, owing to the great distance at which shoots could only be obtained, much retarded the cleansing of the Public ways. The additional cost incurred during the season in the snow removal, including all labour, cartage, &c., was £214 12s. 6d. Application was made to your Board by The London General Omnibus Company for permission to sprinkle salt on the main lines of thoroughfare. Permission was granted, subject to your Surveyor's supervision, but the Company only availed itself of it on one 28 occasion, viz., on the 14th February, 1876, when salt was strewed by the Company on the Carriageway of High Street, between Oxford Street and Denmark Street. The use of Salt for dissolving Snow has given rise to considerable discussion in the Metropolis, many persons alleging that it is most injurious to the health of pedestrians, destructive to their clothing, and detrimental to the hoofs of horses. These objections if they exist, can, however, to a large degree be obviated by a discreet use of the material. Salt was used on the paved Carriageways in your District on several occasions during the past winter, and except to those who actually saw it sprinkled, its use was hardly suspected. The measures adopted were as follows:—The Salt was spread very lightly over the Snow, and as soon as its effect began to be apparent by the discolouration and partial dissolution of the Snow, a time varying from 10 to 20 minutes, the Horse Sweeping Machines were used to sweep the Snow on to the breasts of the Carriageways, the Salt there completing its work without annoyance or detriment to any one using the least ordinary care to avoid it. This use of Salt, by reducing the bulk of the snow, saved considerable labour and cartage, and consequent expense, and enabled the Streets to be cleared in less time and at less expense than would otherwise have been the case. The cost of Street Cleansing from 25th March, 1875, to 25th -March, 1876, was as follows. For Street Orderlies, &c. £1,643 7 11 Amount paid to Contractors for removal of Slop, &c. 1,397 6 8 £3,040 14 7 To additional expense in the removal of Snow:— Street Orderlies £18 1 10 Paviors' Labourers 90 3 2 Salt 8 0 0 Cartage 98 7 6 214 12 6 Total cost of Street Cleansing £3,255 7 1 Street Watering. The Public Ways of the District were Watered under contract from 1st March, 1875, to 1st October, 1875, at the following cost:— To Contractor for hire of men, horses, carts, &c. £1,099 13 0 To cost of water, meter hire, repairs to stand posts, &c. 296 3 3 Total £1,395 16 3 29 Removal of Dust and Ashes. The Dust and Ashes have been removed from the houses in the District under contract at a cost of £1,277 10s. 0d. Limewhiting Courts, etc. The entrances to the Mews, Courts, Yards, &c., in the District were twice limewhited during the year, at a cost of about £60. Public Urinals. The following is a List of the Public Urinals belonging to the Board—20 in number, 10 of which have water laid on to them; the whole are cleansed daily by the Board's workmen. They were painted once during the year, at a cost of about £15. List of Public Urinals in the St. Giles District. Seven Dials 6 Compartments. Water laid on. Dunns Passage 5 „ do.

This has been done, and was recently laid before you. The "Average Meter System" has also been brought prominently to your notice, and is now, with the whole subject of Gas Lighting, under your consideration. In accordance with an arrangement entered into between your Board and the Duke of Bedford, the Public Lamps, eight in number, which formerly existed around the garden railing in Bedford Square, have been removed, and twelve new columns and lanterns of an ornamental pattern, selected by the Board, have been erected. These new lamps have been much approved, and the effect on the lighting of the Square has been most satisfactory. The cost of this work will be defrayed by the Duke of Bedford. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, G. WALLACE, Surveyor. 1875.

GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen,— I have the honour to present my first report. The Annual Report is a record from the 1st January to the 31st December each year. I was elected 2nd November, 1875, and therefore up to that date I have only those records of my predecessor, Dr. Ross, which are in your office. Before discussing the vital statistics of the District, I will place before you a few important facts compiled from the Registrar General's Annual Summary relating to the whole Metropolis:— "The estimated population of London in the middle of the year 32 1875 was 3,445,100, an increase over the numbers of the previous year of 44,459. " The Registered Births were 122,871 The Registered Deaths were 81,513 Excess of Births over deaths . 41,358 " The hirths of males exceeded the births of females by 2,447; and upon the other hand, the deaths of males exceeded the deaths of females by 2,321 ; thus redressing the inequality at birth. "The increase in the population in the years 1861-71 was chiefly in the Outlying Districts, and the decrease in all the Central Districts (of which St. Giles forms a part). "Water Supply.—The water is supplied from the Thames, the Lea, and wells chiefly in the chalk round London. 529,752 metric tons of water were pumped into 518,558 houses and factories daily at the rate of 368 metric tons a minute. "weather.—The mean temperature of the year at Greenwich was 49º.2. The rain-fall was 28.2 inches. The wind blew at the rate of 11.5 miles an hour, which is nearly 1 mile over the average of 26 years." The annual Birth-rate per 1,000 for London in 1875 was 35.7. The annual Death-rate per 1,000 for London in 1875 was 23.7. The Birth-rate per 1,000 for St. Giles District in 1875 was 28.8. The Death-rate per 1,000 for St. Giles District in 1875 was 23.6. The Marriage-rate in St. Giles District. Vital statistics are incomplete without the Marriage-rate. By the courtesy of the Rectors of St. Giles-in-the-Fields and St. George, Bloomsbury, and the Registrar of Marriages for the District, I am enabled to place before you the facts which give that rate. TABLE No. 1.—Showing Number of Marriages which have taken place in St. Giles District during the year 1875. Name of Building. Denomination. Number of Marriages. St. Giles-in-the-Fields (Parish Church, High Street) Established Church 159 St. George, Bloomsbury (Parish Church, Hart Street) Established Church 156 Superintendent Registrar's Office 26 Sardinian Chapel, Duke Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields Roman Catholic 41 Bloomsbury Chapel, Bloomsbury Street Baptist 4 Little Wild Street Chapel Baptist 5 Keppel Street Chapel Baptist 1 Great Queen Street Chapel Wesleyan Methodist 3 Eglise Suisse, Endell Street Swiss Reformed Church 2 Total 397 33 In the year 1875, then, 397 marriages took place in the District, so that 794 persons were married, which, is 14.86 per 1,000 of our population. The Birth-rate in St. Giles District. The Registered Births in St. Giles District for the year 1875 were 1,709; of which 444 belonged to the Sub-District of St. George, Bloomsbury, 803 to St. Giles South, and 462 to St. Giles North. TABLE No. 2.—Shewing Number of Births Registered in St. Giles District during the year 1875. Sub-Districts. Births. St. George, Bloomsbury 444 St. Giles South 803 St. Giles North 462 Entire District 1,709 These numbers require correction, for they do not accurately represent the Birth-rate, either of the whole District or of the SubDistricts. For instance, the following table shews that 89 children were born in St. Giles Workhouse, and 167 in the British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street, and as both of the buildings are situated in St. Giles South, the registrations are effected in that Sub-District; therefore, to make Table No. 2 correct, various alterations must be made. TABLE No. 3.—Shewing the Number of Children Born in Public Institutions in St. Giles District, 1875. Sub-Districts. Workhouse. Lying-in Hospital. Total.

C 34 Again, 167 mothers gave birth to 167 children in the British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street, but out of this number only 22 of the mothers belonged to the united parishes. Therefore, 145 outsiders must be deducted from the aggregate number, and also from the number of St. Giles South, and 3 must be added to the Sub-District of St. George, Bloomsbury, and 9 to St. Giles North. The following tabular form will exhibit the facts more clearly. TABLE No. 4. — Showing the Analysis of the Births in St Giles District. St. Gilea District. St. Giles South, Sub-District.

The mean Birth-rate of St. Giles District and of the SubDistricts are as follows:— TABLE No. 5.—Showing the Birth-rate to Population in St Giles and its Sub-Districts in 1875. Sub-Districts.

The Birth-rate for London in 1875 was 35.7. 35 The Death-rate in St. Giles District. The registered Deaths in St. Giles District for the year 1875 were 1,199, of which 312 belonged to the Sub-District of St. George, Bloomsbury, 546 to St. Giles South, and 341 to St. Giles North. The Deaths are tabulated in the same manner as the Births. TABLE No. 6.— Shewing the Number of Deaths Registered in St. Giles District for the Year 1875. Sub-Districts. Deaths.

I visited the Hospitals of the Metropolis, in order to ascertain from their books the number of persons of our district who died in them, and to ascertain, with a view to exclusion from our deaths, those non-parishioners who died in institutions within our district. The following table will show the number of persons who died during the year in St. Giles Workhouse ; the British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street, and the Infants' Home, 35, Great Coram Street—institutions all situated in St. Giles District.

I will now discuss these tables in order to arrive at a correct Death-rate. 151 persons died in the Workhouse, 7 in the British Lying-in Hospital, 24 in the Infants' Home, together 182. But only 115 of these belonged to us by previous residence, leaving 77 outsiders from various Metropolitan Parishes to be deducted from the entire District, and also from the several Sub-Districts. On the other hand 141 deaths, which occurred in the General Hospitals and Public Institutions outside the District, must be added to our number. The necessary additions and subtractions required to exhibit the actual numbers are made as follows:— TABLE No. 9.—Showing the Analysis of Deaths in St. Giles District St. Giles District.

On making a comparison of the Birth-rate with the Death-rate, we find that the Births for 1875 were 276 more than the Deaths. The Death-rate for London in 1875 was 23.7. The following Table shows the comparative Death-rate in St. Giles and its Sub-Districts for a period of ten years, with the Deathrate for 1875.

The Death-rate for the District in 1875 was below the average of the preceding ten years. Death-rate for 1875 23.63 Death-rate for preceding 10 years 26.87 The Death-rate for the Sub-district of St. George, Bloomsbury, was also lower. Death-rate for 1875 18.83 Death-rate for preceding 10 years 20.0 38 The Death-rate for St. Giles South was much lower. Death-rate for 1875 26.71 Death-rate for preceding 10 years 33.30 But in 1874 the rate was 33.16 The year 1874 was marked by a violent outbreak of Typhus Fever in Great Wild Street and the adjacent Courts, which so much raised the Death-rate, while in 1875 that part of the district was free from fever. The Death-rate for St Giles North was higher in 1875— Death-rate for 1875 25.27 Death-rate for preceding 10 years 23.96 But in 1874, the rate was 21.82 The Death-rate among Infants in St. Giles District. In 1875 the number of children who died under 1 year of age was 289 (excluding the deaths of 24 infants in the Home, Great Coram Street, and 5 in the British Lying-in Hospital). Of these 76 belonged to St. George, Bloomsbury, 118 to St. Giles South, and 95 to St. Giles North. The rate of Mortality was as follows— Whole District 1 Death in every 5'32 Births = 18-77 per cent. of Births. St. George, Bloomsbury 1 do. do. 6.0 do. = 1666 do.

The Death-rate among Persons 60 years of Age and upwards. The registered deaths among persons 60 years of age and upwards were 275; but after the necessary corrections have been made the number is found to be 291, of which 85 belonged to St. George, Bloomsbury, 145 to St. Giles South, and 61 to St. Giles North.

(EXCEPT INFANTS UNDER 1 YEAR AND PERSONS 60 YEARS AND UPWARDS.) The number of deaths among persons at all ages, excluding those who died in extra-parochial institutions and those non-parishioners who died within the district, was 683. The proportions to be distributed among the sub-districts are as follows:—St. George, Bloomsbury, 175; St. Giles South, 247; and St. Giles North, 261. The ratios to the whole mortality, and to population, are thus expressed:— Whole District 1 Death in every 78 of pop. = 12.78 per 1,000 St. George, Bloomsbury 1 do. do. 101 do. = 9.80 do. St. Giles South 1 do. do. 77 do. = 12.93 do. St. Giles North 1 do. do. 63 do. = 15.82 do. The following are the ratios to total deaths:— Whole District 1 in every 1.81 of all Deaths.

The total number of deaths from Zymotic Diseases in the year 1875 was 206, of which 9 belonged to the Enthetic, 7 to the Dietic, and 2 to the Parasitic orders, leaving only 188 against the Mias- D 42 matic order, the number of which was 217 in 1873, and 231 in 1874. The number in 1875 is about the lowest hitherto recorded against the deaths from these causes in St. Giles District. Small-Pox.—No deaths from Small-pox occurred in our District during the year. Not only St. Giles District, but the whole of the Metropolis was remarkably free from this disease in 1875. The only signs of it in our District, which came to my knowledge, were 2 cases belonging respectively to St. George, Bloomsbury, and St. Giles North. Both patients suffered from a mild type of the disease; they were removed to the hospital of the Asylum Board at Stockwell, and both recovered. Our immunity from Small-pox is only in common with that of the whole Metropolis, and is doubtless the result of the great care of Boards of Guardians in enforcing Vaccination. Measles.—Only 15 deaths from Measles occurred, the average number for 10 years being 26.0. The number in 1874 was 31.0. Scarlet Fever.—The Registrar-General states "that the great increase of Scarlet Fever forms the special feature in the returns for the past year." Scarlet Fever was epidemic not only in the Metropolis, but over nearly the whole kingdom, but not with equal intensity. The District has suffered less than some other districts, yet the mortality was heavy, for 48 persons died in the District, being exactly the same number as in 1874, while the average number for ten years was 42.4. The fatality of this disease fluctuates very much in different years, as will be seen more clearly on referring to Table No. 13, ex. gr. in 1870, 103 died from it, and in 1872, only 5. Epidemic Scarlet Fever might often be arrested, if the public would endeavour to carry out the principles laid down for the purpose by competent medical authority ; but both the middle and lower classes of society have yet to learn the importance of fresh air, isolation, and cleanliness, in checking the spread of the disease. It is much to be regretted that children from infected houses should be sent to school, and some means should be adopted to ascertain the existence of disease, in order to the exclusion of such children. Diphtheria.—The District shows a clean bill of health for this disease. Croup.—2 males and 2 females, together 4, being but half the number who died in 1874. Whooping Cough.—Is to be credited with 9 deaths for St. George, Bloomsbury, 19 for St. Giles South, and 21 for St. Giles North, together 49, against 27 for the previous year. This disease, like Scarlet Fever, has been epidemic during a great portion of the year, and the District, in common with the Metropolis, has suffered beyond the average. The Begistrar-General points out 43 "the large proportion of deaths from this disease belonging to the children of the working classes." Whooping Cough, like Measles, during some seasons is slight, at other times, severe; and very frequently dangerous symptoms creep insidiously on before the family is aware, and often before medical aid is sought. Many persons believe that medical remedies are of little avail, and that the disease will run its course "until May arrives," one of those nursery savings which it seems impossible to get rid of. Fevers.—In 1875 the deaths from Fever, which includes Typhoid, Typhus, and Common Continued Fever, were only 10 viz..:— Typhoid. Typhus. Common Continued Fever. Total. St. George, Bloomsbury 4 ... ... 4 St. Giles South 1 ... ... 1 St. Giles North 4 1 ... 5 Whole District 9 1 ... 10 Both the sick and death lists from Fever show a much more satisfactory state of things than in 1874, when 113 patients were sent to Stockwell Hospital from this District (of which 37 cases were Typhus), and the deaths from Fever during the year were 54. (For the number of deaths from Fever in each year from 1865, vide Table No. 13). The marked improvement in the Health of the District is to be connected with the efforts of the Board in enforcing Sanitary Arrangements. Diarrhœa.—The mortality from this disease was 53 against 59 in 1874. The mean number for 10 years is 78. Our deaths, like those of last year, were below the average, and may be accounted for by the low temperature of the summer months. Deaths from Pulmonary Diseases. Bronchitis was again the most fatal disease in the District during the year, and it carried off no less than 260 persons. The cold weather and heavy rain-fall during a greater portion of the season might have been the principal causes in this heavy death-rate, but, without these causes, there are influences enough in the District to produce a heavy death-rate without them. A large number of poor people reside in the District, and live badly both in quality and quantity, and whose homes, as a rule, are cold and comfortless, who, to make up for these deficiencies, frequently indulge in the habit of excessive spirit-drinking ; it is among these that the 44 disease is so fatal, their constitutions, already debilitated, speedily make them fall victims to it. Also the extremes of age, the very young and old, succumb principally to this disease, as will appear by the following table, viz.:— Out of 260 deaths— 88 died before they were 5 years of age. 6 „ between 5 „ and 20 9 „ „ 20 „ „ 40 56 „ „ 40 „ „ 60 95 „ „ 60 „ „ 80 6 „ „ 80 „ „ upwards. Total 260 Deaths from Tubercular Diseases. Consumption is the next heaviest in the death list, and during the year 115 died from phthisis pulmonalis (the tubercular disease chiefly affecting the adult) and 25 from tabes mesenterica (the tubercular disease of the infant), together 140. The heavy deathrate from tubercular complaints, like those from diseases attacking the respiratory organs, occurred to inhabitants of the squalid neighbourhoods. Inquests. There were 88 Inquests held on persons who died from natural, accidental, or wilful causes during the year. It is deplorable so often to find the clause "death accelerated from drinking habits " in the verdicts of the Coroner's Juries. TABLE No. 16.

In some districts many more deaths are returned as uncertified, so that this district appears to he in a more satisfactory state, but there ought to be no uncertified deaths. Mortality in the Workhouse. In 1875 151 deaths took place in the Workhouse, against 187 in 1874. By a recent regulation of the Local Government Board, the sick are removed from the Workhouse to the Central Sick Asylum. District in Cleveland Street. This arrangement reduces the number of deaths at the Workhouse. I have to thank the different officers of the Workhouse for their kindness and attention to me whilst seeking information from their various books. The British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street. During the year, there were 167 poor women delivered in this Hospital, who gave birth to 82 males and 85 females, a total of 167 children, 3 of whom (by previous residence of the mother) belonged to St. George, Bloomsbury, 10 to St. Giles South, 9 to St. Giles North, and 145 to various other Metropolitan districts, and allowance is made for them in the Table of Births, No. 4. No deaths occurred to any of the women during labour, but one of them died some days after confinement from Septicemia. No woman was delivered of twins in the Hospital during the year. 40 Six of the children died, 1 belonging to St. Giles South, and 5 outsiders. No puerperal fever is reported during the 12 months, and the general health of the inmates has been very good. Both the sick and death rate appear to be highly satisfactory, which, undoubtedly, is owing to the efficiency of the staff of the hospital and its management. The Infants' Home, Great Coram Street. Twenty-four children died in the Home in 1875, being 7 less than the previous year. This house, 35, Great Coram Street, is a "Refuge for Destitute Mothers, and a Home for their infants." Young women of hitherto respectable character are admitted, who have, for the first time, become mothers of illegitimate children. Every woman admitted to the Home is allowed to remain there until the child is weaned; during this time the mother is employed in household and needle work, besides having the entire charge of her own child. The mothers do the work of the house, under the superintendence of the matron. When the child is weaned, a situation is mostly found for the mother. The Bloomsbury Dispensary, Great Russell Street. Mr. Steele, the resident Medical Officer of the Bloomsbury Dispensary, has kindly forwarded to me the annual return of the Medical and Surgical cases under treatment by the several medical officers of the Charity during the year. The next table will sufficiently prove the large amount of good work this valuable institution has done during the year.

Underground Eooms.—Thirty-two notices were served on owners of houses for permitting their Underground Rooms to be illegally occupied. In all cases the orders of the Board to vacate those rooms were obeyed. Overcrowding.—Forty-eight cases of Overcrowding occurred in the district during the year. In each case the owner was prompt in endeavouring to eject the tenants. Bakehouses are in fair condition. 49 Cow Sheds.—With one exception they have been kept in a satisfactory condition, and in that case the magistrates refused the application for a license. Slaughter-houses.—The Slaughter-house Act, 1874, empowers the Metropolitan Board of Works to exercise jurisdiction concurrently with local boards of works over Slaughter-houses. The necessary works, in all but two cases, were completed in time for the license, and in those two cases an extension of time was allowed ; so that all the licenses applied for were granted. Rag and Bone Shops.—These shops appear to be kept in a clean condition, considering the nature of the articles dealt in. Artizans' Dwellings Act, 1875.—Dr. Ross mentioned to the Sanitary Committee his proposal to report on the Great Wild Street neighbourhood to the Metropolitan Board of Works for the application of this Act to its improvement, but his lamented death prevented his doing more. On my appointment as your medical officer I was instructed by that Committee to visit and report on the neighbourhood. My report was approved and forwarded to the Metropolitan Board of Works, which afterwards visited the spot with a view to deal with the locality; and the subject is now under their consideration. The past year has been remarkable for a lower death-rate than usual, and the more healthy condition of the district is encouraging to the Board, as a testimony to the value of those efforts which have been made for its improvement. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, S. R. LOVETT, Medical Officer of Health. June, 1870. APPENDIX. TABLE I. Registered Deaths in 52 Weeks of 1875. Sub-Districts of St. Giles.
