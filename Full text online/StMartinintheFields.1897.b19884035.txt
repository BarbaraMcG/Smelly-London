STMART 13 Vestry of St. Martin=in=the=Fields. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH For the Year 1897. LONDON: HARRISON AND SONS, ST. MARTIN'S LANK, Printers in Ordinary to Her Majesty. 1898. MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT, 1897. Annual Report on the Health of the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, for the Year 1897. To the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you my Twentyeighth Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Parish. Births. The Births registered daring the year numbered 175, a decrease of 46 over the previous year, 1896. The following Table gives the number of Births registered in each month of the year:- A. 2  Males. Females. Total. January 4 5 9 February 10 5 15 March 4 11 15 April 7 5 12 May 3 8 11 June 9 10 19 July 5 7 12 August 7 5 12 September 5 6 11 October 7 13 20 November 4 10 14 December 5 14 19 70 99 169* These 175 births will produce a birth-rate of 13.4 per 1,000, against 16.9 of the previous year 1896. The birth-rate in London, for the year 1897, was 30.0 per 1,000. This is the lowest London birth-rate on record. Deaths. The total Deaths registered in the Parish during the year 1897 were 297, a number 43 less than in the previous year. *To these 169 Births occurring in the Parish must be added 6 belonging to St. Martin's which took place at the Bear Yard Receiving Ward, making a total of 175. 3 The following Table gives the number of Deaths registered in each month of the year:— Males. Females. Total. January 22 4 26 February 11 11 22 March 17 12 29 April 17 8 25 May 15 11 26 June 14 11 25 July 11 16 27 August 15 10 25 September 15 7 22 October 11 10 21 November 17 8 25 December 14 10 24 179 118 297 These 297 Deaths include those non-parishioners who died in the Charing Cross Hospital, and must therefore be omitted in estimating the death-rate, but, on the other hand, the deaths occurring in Public Institutions outside the Parish among persons belonging thereto must be added. On referring to Table 8, it will at. once make clear what I have just stated. The Death-rate of the Parish for the year 1897 is 15.2 per 1,000. In London, the Death-rate for the year 1897 is 17.7 per 1,000. With the exception of the rate in the year 1894, the rate in 1897 was the lowest hitherto recorded in London. Infantile Mortality. Of the 199 deaths of parishioners occurring within and outside of the Parish, 44 were under 5 years of age, equal to 221 per cent. of the total deaths. a 2 4 The deaths of Infants under 1 year of age numbered 28, equal to 14.1 per cent. of the total deaths, and 160.0 to 1,000 registered births. In London, for the year 1897, the deaths of Infants under 1 year of age to 1,000 births were 159. Old Age Mortality. The deaths of parishioners over 60 years of age, occurring within and out of the Parish, were 67. 34 were from 60 to 70 years of age. 20 „ „ 70 „ 80 „ 8 „ „ 80 „ 90 5 ., ,, 90 „ 100 „ Causes of Death. Zymotic Diseases.—The principal Zymotic Diseases are Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Typhoid Fever, Typhus Fever, Puerperal Fever, Cholera, and Diarrhœa. The number of deaths occurring in the Parish from this class of disease was 24. This number includes those nonparishioners who died in the Charing Cross Hospital. After deducting these, and adding those parishioners who died in Public Institutions outside the Parish, the mortality due to St. Martin's would be 15, against 31 of the previous year, 1896. Vide Table 5. Small-Pox.—Two cases of this disease were notified, one of which I refused to accept, as I considered the case was not contracted in the parish. On receiving the notification, I ascertained the following particulars:—A man, a tailor by trade, and 55 years of age, had been residing for some little time at 12, Bear Street, Leicester Square; he was suffering from Consumption, and on the 28th December, 1896, he was admitted into the Cleveland Street Asylum for treatment. On 25th February, 1897, two 5 months after admission, he was found to be suffering from Smallpox. I further learnt that a man about that time (February) had been admitted into the Cleveland Street Asylum suffering from supposed Erys'pelas, which later on proved to be Small-pox; this man infected several of the inmates of the Asylum along with the case notified to me. The man from Bear Street was removed from Cleveland Street Asylum to the Small-pox Hospital Ship, "Castalia," of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, where he subsequently died of the disease. The other notified case occurred in Long Acre, was removed to hospital and recovered. Measles.'—One death was due to this complaint. Scarlet Fever.—No death was recorded as occurring in the Parish, but two parishioners died from this malady in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. The number of cases of Scarlet Fever notified during the year was 44, against 71 of the previous year, 1896. Diphtheria.—Eight deaths from this disease occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, of which two were parishioners, and one in Whitcomb Street, making a total of three to the credit of St. Martin's. A female, a non-parishioner, also died in the parish of Diphtheria as she was being conveyed to the Charing Cross Hospital. Whooping Cough.—Three deaths occurred in the parish from this complaint, also two parishioners in hospitals outside the parish, making, in all, 5 for the year. Typhoid Fever.—Seven deaths were recorded from this disease, all of which occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, and only one of that number was a parishioner. Typhus Fever.—No death was recorded from this malady. Puerperal Fever.—One death was recorded from this disease. 6 Cholera.—Nil. Diarrhœa.—Two deaths were due to this complaint, one of of which occurred outside the parish. Inquests. During the year 1897, inquests were held in the Parish in reference to the deaths of 63 persons, of whom 13 were residents, and also 3 inquests were held respecting the deaths of parishioners outside the Parish. The causes which produced death were as fellows:— Natural causes 21 Pistol Shot Wound (suicide) 3 Drowning 7 Burns and Scalds 4 Suffocation when in bed with parents (infants) 2 Poison, Prussic Acid (suicide) 1 „ Cyanide of Potassium (suicide) 1 3 „ Opium (suicide) 1 Injuries received from being run over or knocked down by vehicles in the street 9 Injuries received from a fall from scaffold at the Alhambra Theatre 1 Injuries received from falling off a van and being run over by same 1 Injuries received from falling from window 2 „ to head from fall when iutoxicated 1 „ to throat (suicide) 2 ,, received in a lift 1 ,, „ on the line of the South Eastern Railway Company 2 Injuries received through the overturning of a cab 1 7 Inquests—continued. Injuries received from falling- down stairs 2 ,, ,, in a boxing contest 1 „ „ through falling into a trench at the new Admiralty Buildings, Spring Gardens 1 Exposure and want of food (infant) 1 Cause not specified (newly-born infant) 1 66 Notification of Infectious Disease. During the year 1897 the number of cases of infectious disease notified in accordance with The Public Health (London) Act 1891 was 81, as against 120 of the previous year. On referring to Table 10 the diseases will be found specified, and the localities where the cases occurred. The fees paid to the Medical Practitioners for forwarding the notification of these 81 cases amounted to £9 3s. 0d., which sum is repaid to your Vestry by the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Disinfection after Infectious Disease. During the year 70 rooms and the contents thereof were disinfected by your Contractor, at a cost of £80 19s. 10d. The House to House Inspection. This undertaking I am unable to report as finished, but at the same time is progressing in a satisfactory manner. When this inspection was commenced three inspectors were engaged for carrying out the work; three months afterwards one resigned, reduciug the number to two, and fourteen months from the commencement of this inspection the remaining two inspectors sent in their resignations. 8 We then engaged a new man to take up the thread of the work; he, however, resigned last year, and another was selected to fill his place, so practically speaking we have had nearly the whole of the time only one inspector for the work. The drainage works in course of construction have to be superintended by the inspector, who for that purpose pays frequent visits to the houses, and when completed, the drains are tested by means of the water test. These proceedings, I need hardly point out, take up a great deal of time. In the appended list of houses where notices and plans have been sent in of intention to lay down new drains since the commencement of this inspection down to the end of May, 1898, the number will be found to have reached nearly GOO; in addition, an almost equal number of houses have had sanitary defects remedied, but which have not involved the drains. This undertaking has been carried out so as to cause as little friction and annoyance as possible to the parishioners, and the fact that so rarely have legal proceedings been resorted to clearly shows that tact and discretion have been exercised by your officers in carrying out this work. Appended is a list of those premises where notices and plans have been sent in of intention to lay down new drains since the commencement of this inspection down to the end of May, 1898.

The net gain in life saved during 1897 is represented by 7,651 lives. In other words, had the average death-rate in 1887-96 continued throughout the year under present notice, 7,651 lives would have been sacrificed in addition to those which have been actually lost by death. In the year 1897 there was, as compared with the decennial average, an excess of 222 deaths from diphtheria, 1,156 from diarrhœal diseases, 475 from cancer, 282 from premature birth, 135 from urinary diseases, and 134 from accident. Under each of the other headings in the table the mortality in 1897 was below the average. This was notably the case in regard to measles, whooping-cough, phthisis, and diseases of the nervous and of the respiratory system, the deaths referred to the last-mentioned group of diseases being 4,910 below the annual average.
