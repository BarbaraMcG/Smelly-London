FRI 9 TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE Friern Barnet Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Report for the year 1911, to which is attached the Report of Mr. Albert Harman, which again shows a good record of sanitary work done by him during the year. I have pleasure in expressing to the Members of the Council my appreciation of their unfailing courtesy and assistance during the past year. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Frank A. Spreat. For the convenience of the Local Government Board and those not well acquainted with the District, I repeat the following short description. The District of Friern Burnet is situated in the Loudon area, and is bounded on the North by East Barnet, on the East by Southgate, on the South by Hornsey, and on the West by Finchley. It comprises 1,304 acres (including 152 acres occupied by the buildings and grounds of the Colney Hatch Asylum), most of which is undulating ground, varyiug from 150 to 800 feet above the sea level, the geological formation being Loudon clay, with here and there patches of gravel. 2 The General Character of the District.—For the purposes of representation statistics, &c. it is divided into three Wards—North, South, and Central; and in addition Colney Hatch Asylum, situated between the Central and South Wards, is treated separately, as to include the deaths (more than twice those of the district) of such an Institution with those of the District would create a mistaken and adverse impression of the health of the District. The population is unevenly distributed; thus in the North Ward a large part is pasture land, and the houses for the most part are of a higher rateable value, being detached and separated some distance from each other, but during the year several houses of lower rent have been built. The houses in the Central Ward are chiefly semi-detached, and in terraces and streets. Many new houses have been built lately. The South Ward is the most thickly populated, the houses being of the usual six-roomed kind, and are inhabited in many cases by more than one family. In this Ward also there is the tendency to the erection of flats, and the conversion of six-roomed houses into flats. The Bounds of the District were beaten by the Overseers on May 3rd, 1910, and additional boundary plates were fixed where necessary. Vital Statistics. Population.—I have before explained the methods adopted for estimating the intercensal years, and the reasons that have led me to adopt the figure 5.4 for estimating the population. Taking the number of occupied houses in the middle of the year as 2295, and multipying by 5.4, gives an estimated population of 12,394, and this number agrees very nearly with the census, allowance being made for the different periods under consideration, the census being taken in April and the estimate of the population of the District in June. 3 The population in 1881 was 4,405: in 1891, 6,716; and in 1901, 8,8l6; the average number of persona per house being respectively 6.01 and 5.6 for the two later years, as estimated from figures supplied from the Census Offices by the Registrar-General. Total population at all ages at Census of 1901:— District, 8,816 ; Asylum, 2,750 11,566 Number of inhabited houses 1,633 Average number of persons per house 5.6 Total population at all ages at Census of 1911:— District, 12,185 ; Asylum, 2,740 14,925 Number of inhabited houses 2,765 Average number of persons per house 5.4 The following table gives the number of occupied and unoccupied houses, together with the estimated population for each Ward for this year. North. South. Central. Total. Houses occupied 469 1077 749 2295 „ unoccupied 38 188 65 291 Estimated population 2533 5816 3945 12,394 The population per acre in 1901 was approximately 8 in 1910 it was 8.9. and is now 9.5. Births. These numbered 307, giving a birth-rate of 24.5, being a decrease of 5.7. The natural increase of the population by the excess of births over deaths was 307—138=169; the excess iu 1908 being 213; in 1907, 177; in 1906, 152; and in 1910, 240. Deaths. There were 104 deaths (Tables I., III., and IV.) registered in the District, excluding the Asylum, giving a death-rate of 8.4, an improvement of 0.1 on 1910. 4 Thirty-four deaths occurred outside the District of persons belonging to it, giving a net total of 104—34=138, showing a net death-rate of 11.2, and producing a deathrate corrected for age and sex distribution by the factor 1.0774 of 12. Deaths occurring between 1 and 2 years.—Of these one was Diarrhoea, two Bronchitis, and one Measles. Between 2 and 5.—There was one due to Measles. Between 45 and 65.—There were 33 deaths. Of these six were due to Phthisis, five to Cancer, and five to Pneumonia. Between 65 and upwards.—There were 47, of which twelve were due to old age, and ten to Heart Disease. Thus 34 per cent of the total number of deaths was due to old age. Infantile Mortality, The number of deaths under one year was 38, twelve more than in 1910, giving and infantile mortality rate of 123. We have to go back to 1906 for any thing approaching so high an infantile mortality rate, and this only confirms my remarks made in my last report on the determining influence of high temperature and low rainfall on the incedence of intestinal diseases. The summer of 1911 having been the hottest and driest for some years. Previous to the circular of the Local Government Hoard, of August, drawing attention to the importance of domestic scaven ging and general cleanliness, and the part played by insects in polluting fcods, a circular letter had been prepared and issued on the subject by this authority. There is no doubt but that the high rate of 123 is due to the above conditions. 19 of the 38 deaths being due to intestinal diseases. Last year there were only two deaths from this disease. 5 The following is a table comparing the number of houses occupied and unoccupied, the population, births, birth-rate, deaths, and death-rate since 1885, giving an idea of the growth and health of the District during that period:— Yeah.

The Zymotic death-rate—deaths from the following diseases— Small-pox, Measles, Scarlatina, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Diarrhoea, Fever (Typhus, Typhoid and Continued) was 1.76, due almost entirely to deaths from summer Diarrhoea. 6 The principal Epidemic Diseases Death-rate in previous years was:— 1884 2.1 1885 1.2 1886 2.7 1887 0.8 1888 1.5 1889 0.7 1890 1.6 1891 1.5 1892 1.0 1893 2.3 1894 1.6 1895 0.9 1896 1.5 1897 2.5 1898 1.9 1899 2.5 1900 0.5 1901 1.8 1902 1.4 1903 1.4 1904 1.1 1905 1.0 1906 1.5 1907 0.58 1508 0.47 1909 0.63 1910 0.6 It will be seen from Table II. that 49 Notification Certificates of Infections Diseases were received as compared with 50 in 1906,78 in 1907, 122 in 1908, 114 in 1909. and 56 in 1910. The decrease being due to the fewer number of Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever and Tuberculous cases. Table of Infectious Diseases. Month. Smallpox. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria Enteric. Erysipelas.

During the year I received 7 notifications of coDtact persons. Five of these related to workmen engaged in building new Post Office premises in Islington. They were visited over a period of 11 days, but no case developed. The remaining 2 notifications were received from the Southampton Port Authority respecting travellers. scarlet fever. 18 cases were notified as compared with 16 in 1910 and 27 in 1909. These cases were removed to Hospital. Enteric Fever. Two cases were notified, neither case was removed to Hospital. There was no death. Puerperal Fever. There were 2 cases, neither being attended by midwile. Erysipelas. There were 11 cases, 5 of which occurred in the Asylum. Measles. This disease has been present to a slight extent only. There were a few cases at St. Paul's Schools during June, but I did not consider it necessary to take any steps with a view to closing any department of the schools, after careful consideration of the number of cases, and the proportion of children who had already had the disease, &c., &c. 9 Whooping Cough. There was an outbreak at St. John's Schools in December, 28 cases being notified. Mumps This disease was prevalent at the Middlesex County Council's Infants Schools in Sydney Road, during the Autumn. Phthisis and other Tubrecular Diseases. Seven cases were notified as belonging to the district, 6 under the Poor Law, aud one under the Hospital regulations. Ten Transfer notifications were received of patients transferred from Leavesden to Colney Hatch Asylums, aud 14 general notifications. The death rate was .48. In each case, it has been the practice for many years past, ou a case being brought to notice the premises are visited, the nature of the disease explaiaed, aud disinfectants aud leaflets supplied. Disinfection after removal aud fatal case is carried out as far as possible, and has generally been readily accepted. There is no hospital accommodation for this disease. Poor Law cases are as far as possible sent to a sanatorium. Asylum.—There were 56 deaths from this disease, approximately one fifth of the total number 262. This Institution has Isolation accommodation for Phthisis. 10 Cancer. There were 11 deaths, giving a death rate of .9. Infections Diseases other than those notifiable under the Act. 1911 is the second year of systemic notification of disease by School Teachers. The following notifications have been received, Disease.

Midwives Act. Two cases of puerperal fever were notified. There are five Midwives working iu, but only one of these is living within the district. Isolation Hospitals. The District, under an arrangement with the Southgate District Council, has six beds for the treatment of Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, and Enteric Fever. Fourteen cases have been removed to hospital during the year. Provision has this year been made for Smallpox. The District having made arrangements with the Middlesex Joint Smallpox Hospital Board. Infectious Diseases and the Means taken to Prevent their Spread. On receipt of information respecting infectious case the premises are visited, a printed list of instructions as to necessary precautions is given and explained, disinfectants are supplied, and the schools attended, in the case of children, and their employers in the case of adults, notified. Removal to an Isolation Hospital is offered, and when accepted is carried out, subject to beds being obtained. After recovery or removal of an infectious case, disinfection of the room or rooms occupied is performed by means of sulphur and formalin. Cleansing and stripping notices are served where necessary. 12 Clothes, bedding, &c., are removed to Finchley, where they are put through the steam disinfector. Diagnosis outfits and antitoxin are supplied free to medical men for use in cases occurring in the District, and the suspected specimens are examined and reported upon at the expense of the Council. Supplies of antitoxin are kept at the Council Chambers in the Central Ward, and at the residence of the Medical officer of Health in the North Ward and at that of the Sanitary Inspector in the South Ward. Medical men have availed themselves ot this serum, both for acute cases and as a preventive. This is the first year that we have received information respecting Infectious diseases throughout the country by means of a return received direct from the Statistical Department of the L.G.B. These returns are compiled by local weekly reports sent to the Statistical Department and the County M.O.H, from each authority in the Kingdom. On the receipt for notification of Infections disease among pupils of the elementaly schools, a form giving full particulars of contacts, is sent to the Chief Medical Inspector of Schools for the County, and copies of this form are also sent to the school teacher, and the attendance officer, with a view to their exclusion. Housing. The house accommodation still meets the demand. In the South Ward, the most densely populated, there are 188 unoccupied houses. Overcrowding. A few cases were dealt with under the nuisance clauses of the Public Health Act 1875. 13 Two representations were made under the Housing and town planning act, and closing orders were made and are still in force. The two houses which were closed last year, have been put into repair, and the closing order determined. Common Lodging Houses. There are not any. Movable Dwellings. Four cases have been dealt with. Canals. There are none iu the district. Meat and Food Inspections. The Sanitary Inspector has continued to give this matter attention, and the butchers' shops and general food vendors' premises are under periodical inspection. The meat sold in the District is chiefly derived from the Meat Markets of London, and show signs of having been previously inspected. All locally killed pork is inspected ou exposure for sale, and the glands of the neck and throat are incised and examined. Pig Keeping. I would repeat that it does not seem possible to convince the ordinary ig-keeper that the pig is really a clean animal in his habits, the opinion prevails, it would 14 almost appear that the dirtier the surroundings and the more decomposed his food the more he likes it and the better he thrives. The result of such erroneous ideas is that Piggeries are almost always carried on in such a manner as to be bordering on if not actually a nuisance. With the rapid extension of building the difficulties surrounding this industry have largely increased. In one case proceedings were taken and a conviction obtained, which was upheld on appeal, on account of repeated complaints. Application was made to the Local Government Board asking that pig-keeping be scheduled as an offensive trade. The application was refused. There is no doubt that the boiling of food in a semifermentivestate, and the extraction of fat therefrom is very offensive, quite apart from the intolerable stench which arises from a number of pigs improperly kept. Offensive Trades. There are not any. Dust Disposal and Removal. This is undertaken by the Engineer and Surveyor's Department. The collection is made weekly, and the dust removed in covered vans. Notices are served as required to provide portable sanitary dust-bins in place of worn-out or unsanitary bins. The refuse is chiefly taken to the Sewage Works and deposited on the ground. The provision of an up-to-date Dust Destructor is before the Council, and the Committee have the matter under consideration. 15 Ambulence. This District does not yet possess an Ambulance, but satisfactory arrangements have been made with the Finchley District Council for the hire of their conveyance. mortuary. The Finchley District Council have an excellent Mortuary a short distance from Friern Barnet's West boundary, and arrangements have been made for its use. Coroner's Inquests. The large room on the West side of the Council Offices has been fitted np for Coroner's Inquests, and during the year a number of Finchley and Friern Barnet Inquests have been held here. The Council Offices being near the Finchley Mortuary, this room has been found convenient for holding the Finchley Inquests. Formerly the Inquests were held at public-houses. Legislation.

Situation of the Works.—The Sewage Works are situated on the South side of the Di trict (in Wood Green Parish), and within 100 yards of a small brock, into which the effluent flows. The original works were completed at the end of 1886, from designs furnished by Mr. Baldwin Latham, M.Inst.C.E., and were executed under his direction. The works have been extended from time to time aud continue to produce a very satisfactory effluent. The method of treatment is as follows:— The sewage, which enters the works by gravitation, is first passed through a revolving screen, after which a solution of Buxton lime equal to 4 grains per gallon is added, and the whole is thoroughly mixed. It then receives alunrinoferric to the extent of 1 grain per gallon, and is again well mixed by passing through a salmon ladder; and in this 17 dition it flows into settling tanks, of which there are five, four having a capacity of 70,000 gallons, and the fifth, which will hold 92,000 gallons. The overflow from the tanks first passes out of the tanks into an opeu channel, then into the first Contact Bed, and through the filter or second Bacteria Beds into an effluent chamber, and thence into the brook referred to above. The roads in this District have separate sewers for storm water, and all houses except the older ones have the dual system of drainage. An endeavour is being made to carry the storm water from the old houses into the surface water sewers, as opportunities occur. This is very necessary, as everything should be done to make the flow of sewage at any sewage works as uniform as possible. The sewage from the Avenue and Ely Place section of the Disrict has to be pumped to the Sewage Works, and in this case any rain water admitted to the sewers greatly increases the cost of lifting the sewage to the gravitation sewers. New Sewers. During 1911 new sewers have been laid in part of Beaconsfield Road, Chandos Avenue (Extension), Fenstanton Avenue (site of), Clevedou Avenue (site of) and a further portion of the watercourse running eastwards from the Finchley boundary near Grove Road has been enclosed and culverted with a 4 ft. diameter culvert consisting of reinforced granite concrete tubes laid in concrete. 18 Water Supply. The Barnet Water Company now gives a constant and good supply. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops. A list of these will be found under the Scheme at the end of the Report. These have been constantly inspected, and suggestion for the personal cleanliness of the milkers and the groom ing of the cows have again been urged. Veterinary surgeon has not yet been appointed. On complaint one sample of milk was taken and found to be adulterated, and was dealt with by the County Authority. Slaughter Houses. There is only one in the district, subject to an annual use. 19 Notification of Births Act. [Form of Notification.] Reference Urban District Council of Friern Barnet NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS ACT, 1907.

Notification of birth must be sent to the Medical Officer of Health within 30 hours after birth, under a penalty not exceeding -20/- in case of default. 2. The duty of notifying falls firstly on the father, but if not living at home at the time, secondly on any person in attendance at the time of, or within 6 hours after the birth. 3. Therefore those in attendance upon the mother should arrange amongst themselves who will send the notification to the Medical Officer of Health. 20 Forms or letters received 190 Total Births notified 196 Males 95 Females 79 Sex not stated 8 Still Births 1 No. of Births attended by Midwives 106 Visits requested 0 Visits by Voluntary Helpers 0 Visits by Sanitary Inspector 21 Number of Cards of Hints sent 190 In all cases where the mother is attended by a midwife the notification forms are sent to the Chief Inspector under the Midwives Act, after the particulars are entered in the Register. There has been a falling off in the number of notifications during the year from 67—64 per cent. The midwives are very prompt in sending nofifi :ations cf births, over 50 per cent, of the notifications come from them. School*. 1, All Saints; 2, St. John's ; 3, Friern Lane ; 4, St. Peter's ; 5, St. Peter's ; 6 and 7, Middlesex County Schools (Sydney Road and Holly Park). All these seven schools have been frequently inspected, and have been found to be in good order. During epidemics the schools are visited daily and lists of absentees obtained, whose homes are visited. Disinfectants are supplied for use in the lavatories, and also to be added to the water with which the slates, desks, and floors are washed. 21 During the vacations the schools are thoroughly disinfected. I would again urge the necessity of a supply of paper in the school W.C.'s. Inspections. I have inspected Oakleigh Road, Bawtry Road, Sydney Road, Alexandra Road, Pembroke Road, Roman Road, The Avenue, Holmsdale and Stanhope Roads, the mews and Licensed Houses, &c., &c. Public Improvements. The whole of the south footway along the Friern Barnet Road and the remainder of the north footway have been paved with Patent Victoria Stone, and the Middlesex County Council have agreed to contribute about £490 towards the cost of this work. The footways of the new road Avenue extension and the east footpath of the Oakleigh Road South from the Friern Barnet Road to the boundary by the Recreation Ground have also been paved with Patent Victoria Stone. Various Roads have been widened in parts and footway repairs have been carried out where necessary. Kerbing, channelling has been done and a portion of the road in Friern Lane near Myddleton Park opposite widening has been made up. Fire Brigade.—This Council has a retained Fire Brigade. The District is well served with water at a high pressure, there being Hydrants at frequent intervals. Many additional fire hydrants have been fixed during the year. Post Office Telegraphs.—Undergronnd mains have been laid in the Torriugton Park, Friern Barnet Boad, Coluey Hatch Lane and Friern Barnet Lane. 22 Post Office Facilities.—An additional Post Office has been provided opposite the Council Offices. Vent Columns.—Additional vent columns have been fixed wherever necessary. Dust Prevention and Motor Traffic:—All the public roads of the District were coated with hot tar during the summer. This work both protects the surface of the load, aeduces the scavenging and watering, and prevents nuisances from storms of dust. The Council have now two tar spraying machiues. The Council should continue the practice of coating all roads with broken granite as this makes a better sir-face than broken gravel. The tarring of the roads strengthens their surface, as the surface is rendered impervious, the watering and rains cleansing the roads without washing the surface away. The, Friary Park.—The Local Government Board have now sanctioned a further loan for £2,500 for various works in the Park and conveniences, Bowling Green, Rockeries, Ponds, etc., are being constructed. Three Drinking Fountains, the gilt of the Metropolitan Cattle Trough and Drinking Fountain Association have been fixed and were much appreciated during the summer months. Mews.—The Council have given special attention to these during the past year. Lighting.—All-night lighting by means of Automatic Clockwork Controllers is now general throughout the District except for a portion of the North Ward. Additional lamps have been fixed and the lighting improved in many parts of the District. Allotments.*— As in past years the Council have continued their search for suitable laud and have entered into a provisional agreement to purchase five acres of land and 23 cottages off the Oakleigh Road North. Application has been made to the Local Government Board for a loan and sanction to purchase this land. Homing of the Working Classes.—This matter is under consideration and the Council desire to purchase some laud between Sydney Road and Alexandra Road for this purpose. On referring to the table ot houses and population, it will be seen that there are 188 unoccupied houses in this the South Ward. Town Planning Act.—This matter has been considered in connection with the development of the Friern Watch Estate. Sewage Works.—After several years negotiations the London County Council Asylums Committee have agreed to straighten the water course forming the Northern Boundary of these Works and the matter is now being put in hand. This is a long needed improvement and will prevent floodiugs iu the Asylum Grounds. Urinals, Conveniences, etc.—The Council have considered the question of providing a convenience near the boundary of this District and are taking the matter up with the adjoining Authorities. Great Northern Railway Bridge, Friern Barnet Road. —The Agreements for widening this Dangerous Bridge are now completed, and application will be made for a loan for this work as soon as the detail plans are ready. Tree Planting, Public Roads.—This work has been continued during the past year, and I would recommend that trees be planted wherever possible, particularly in the poorer parts of the District. 24 Table 1.

For years before 1911 some of the corrected rates probably will not be available. The rates should be calculated per 1,000 of the estimated gross population. In a district in which large Public Institutions for the sick or infirm seriously affect the statistics, the rates in Columns 5 and 13 may be calculated on a nett population, obtained by deducting from the estimated gross population the average number of inmates not belonging to the district in such institutions. *In Column 6 are to be included the whole of the deaths registered during the year as having actually occurred within the district. In Column 12 is to be entered the number in Column 6, corrected by subtraction of the number in Column 8 and by addition of the number in Column 9. Deaths in Column 10 are to be similarly corrected by subtraction of the deaths under 1, included in the number given in Column 8, and by addition of the deaths under 1 included in the number given in Column 9. 25 The following special cases arise as to Transferable Deaths:— (1) Persons dying in Institutions for the sick or infirm, such as hospitals, lunatic asylums workhouses, and nursing homes 'but not almshouses) must be regarded as residents of the district in which they had a fixed or usual residence at the time of admission. If the person dying in an Institution had no fixed residence at the time of admission, the death is not transferable. If the patient has been directly transferred from one such institution to another, the death is transferable to the district of residence at the time of admission to the first Institution. ('2) The deaths of infants born and dying within a year of birth in an Institution to which the mother was admitted for her confinement should be referred to the district ot fixed or usual residence of the parent. (3) Deaths from Violence are to be referred (a) to the district of residence, under the general rule ; (b) if this district is unknown, or the deceased had no fixed abode, to the district where the accident occurred, if known , (c) failing this, to the district where death occuried, if known; and (d) failing this, to the district where the body was found.

TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE friern Barnet Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I beg to submit my report for the Year ending 31st December, 1911, including a summary of the work carried out, in the abatement and suppression of nuisances, the means taken to check the spread of disease, and the supervision of the food supply of the district. Complaints. These numbered 111, and were investigated, 13 related to the non-removal of dust and were handed over to the Surveyor's Department to deal with, four related to matters not remedial under Public Health Law. Nuisances. The number dealt with was 457, of these 431 were abated and 20 imabated on the 31st of December. The supervision of all works for the abatement of nuisances is carried out by your Inspector, 38 The number of nuisances causing heavy constructional work to drains, roofs, and yards gets less every year, as the old houses are put in repair, leaving more time lor your Inspector to deal with insanitary conditions arising from dirt and overcrowding and to pay more attention to the food supply. Ambulance and Disinfections. Thirteen patients were removed to hospital by your Inspector aud one privately. This Authority continues to use the Finchley Ambulance for this purpose, and so long as the amount of disease keeps small in both Districts the arrangement is workable without much delay. In times of stress, however, Friern Barnet has to take second place and loss of time arises in getting the patient away. Our arrangement for isolation of patients with Sonthgate however, compensates us to some extent, as the time formerly taken in hunting up beds from the surrounding districts' hospitals is now saved. After removal, the room previously occupied by the patient is fumigated with formaldehyde or sulphur di oxide and the walls sprayed with a 1.l000 solution of perchloride of mercury. Where the room requires it, stripping notices are served. Disinfection is now carried out alter Phthisis, cancer and any other disesase 011 request of medical practitioner, and disinfectants supplied to buildeis and others for vermin killing at cost price, Factory and Workshops Acts. The inspections of Factories, Workshops and Workplaces, numbered 235. The Sauitary conveniences of two factories have been overhauled, aud put into proper condition and sundry nuisances from uncleanliness have been abated. Three notices of occupation of new workshops have been received from H.M. Inspector. Bight names of outworkers have been received from other districts. There are apparently no employers employing outworkers in this district as no lists have been received. 39 The Bakehouses receive periodical inspection and have been kept fairly well. In two instances flour is stored within the bakehouse, and this greatly reduces the air space available, but so long as the act is not contravened the practice con not be prevented. Food Inspection. This as in previous years has had special attention. There are 52 premises where food is sold under periodical inspection. The business of fish frying is carried on in two places within the district and in each case the business is well conducted, although the frying ranges are a little out of date. The Council have no bye-laws governing this trade. During the summer, special attention was given to the ice-cream shops, aud 14 samples purchased aud subjected to microscopical examination. The itinerant vendor of ice-cream was not observed in the district during the year. The hawkers,of food within the District are well known to your Inspector, aud their wares are frequently inspected. In case of doubt, these vendors bring their goods for inspection before offering for sale. It has been necessary to condemn one case of mackerel aud two boxes of kippers as unfit for food. I gave a certificate to enable the trader to get a refund of the purchase price in each case, but before doing so, insisted on seeing the invoice or receipt identifying the goods. There is low only one slaughterhouse iu the district, killing days— Mondays aud Wednesdays. The premises are subject to annual licence, and your Inspector is present as often as possible. The business is well conducted. Much of the meat consumed iu this district is imported or comes from the Louden Markets, aud has been previously inspected. 40 Sale, of Food and Drugs Acts. This Act is administered by the County Authorities, but we have an arrangement coming into use in 1912, whereby your Inspector takes informal samples for examination by the Public Analyst. One sample of milk taken by your Inspector, during the year was found adulterated, the matter was followed up by the County Inspector and a conviction obtained. Petroleum Acts. Various applications have been received for information of the conditions attaching to licences for storing petroleum, In one Instance your Inspector, with the Captain of the Fire Brigade, visited some stables where it was intended to store petroleum, but the premises were quite unsuitable and the application was not proceeded with. Statutory Notices Legal Proceedings. Twenty-two statutory notices were served during the year. This is the largest number of this type of notices that has been served in one year since your Inspector has held office, and can only be accounted for by the fact that the persons responsible had difficulty in removing some families, causing overcrowding. In only one instance was it necessary to go to the magistrates, a conviction was obtained and upheld on appeal. Re-Drainage. During the year, 13 houses have been re-drained. the number of nuisances from defective drainage becomes less every year, showing that most of the old houses have been re-drained, and put in order, and that owners are finding out that it pays to put in the best of materials and workmanship 41 There are some however, who regard the requirements of the sanitary authority as exacting, and it needs tact to convince them that it is not what bye-laws require, hut what the abatement, and prevention of the recurrence of the nuisance requires that should be considered. Cast iron for drains is now becoming more usual, and the practice of using light iron pipe for ventilating shafts is extinct. House to House Inspections. This work continues as opportunity serves, and 147 houses were primarily inspected in this manner. The primary object of house to house inspection is to get nuisances abated, and experience shows that this object can only be attained by constant inspection and re-inspection of the same houses. Many of the uuisances arise from ignorance of the elementary principles of hygeine, aud a few visits from the Inspector and a talk with the occupiers accomplishes more sanitary improvements than many notices. There is a tendency to overcrowd some of the small houses in the Avenue district, and 20 cases came under the notice of your Inspector during the year, but so long as rents keep high there will always be this tendency to overcrowd, two or more families sharing the expenses of a house only adapted for one family. The provision of extra W.C's., Sink etc., does not check this overcrowding, but on the other hand seems to encorage it on the principle "The more convenience, the more people to share it and cut down expense." Advantage has been taken of the new powers conferred by the Housing & Town Planning Act, and two houses have been closed as unlit for human habitation. The provisions ot the Act are not so workable as the Nuisance clauses of the Public Health Act, in dealing with small property, aud the majority of nuisances found thereon. The Powers of closing however, conferred on the Local Authority by the Housing Act, greatly assietthe prompt removal of grossly insanitary conditions. Two closing orders made in 1910 were determined on the owner putting the houses into substantial repair. 42 Clerical Work. Your Inspector performs all the clerical work of the Health Department. The following is a list of books now in use:- Register of Infectious disease (Notification Acts). „ „ Tuberculous persons (Tuberculosis Regulations) „ „ Nuisances, „ „ Samples purchased, „ „ Medical Specimens examined, ,, „ House to House Inspections (one for each ward) „ „ Transferred notifications, „ „ Notices sent to School Authorities and County M.O.H.
