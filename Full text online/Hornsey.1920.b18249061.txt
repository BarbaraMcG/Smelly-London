Births.— The number of Births recorded during 1920 was males 861 and females 846, making a total of 1,707. This is an increase of 519 as compared with the number of births registered in 1919. In the preceding twelve months (1919 compared with 1918) there was an increase of 151 in the recorded births. Twenty-three of the births occurred in the Edmonton Infirmary and 86 at other Institutions and places outside the Borough. The birth-rate for the year was 17.3, as compared with 12.09 in 1919. Illegitimate Births.— There were 76 illegitimate births recorded in 1920, and 33 in 1919. The proportion of illegitimate births to the total registered births is 4.4 per cent., an increase of 1.6 as compared with last year. Seventeen of the illegitimate births occurred in the Edmonton Infirmary. Deaths.— The number of deaths registered in the Borough in 1920 was 657, being 115 deaths less than the number registered in 1919. The death-rate calculated on these figures (gross death-rate) is 6.7 per thousand of the mean population for the year. This is 1.5 less than in 1919. 4 This includes only deaths actually registered in the Borough, and does not include those of Hornsey people dying elsewhere. There were 285 Hornsey people who died outside the District during 1920, viz.:— 104 in the Edmonton Workhouse Infirmary. 21 in the Great Northern Central Hospital. 7 in the Prince of Wales' General Hospital. 70 in other Hospitals outside the Borough. 13 in Lunatic Asylums, 57 in various other places, and 13 in Sanatoria. On the other hand there were 39 deaths registered in Hornsey of persons nan-resident in the District. To get the nett deaths belonging to Hornsey we must add to the number of deaths registered in the Borough the number (285) of Hornsey people dying outside the Borough, and deduct the number (39) of deaths registered in Hornsey cf persons who normally resided in other districts. This gives the nett number of deaths belonging to Hornsey as 903, a decrease of 89 on the corresponding number for 1919. The death-rate calculated on these figures: is the nett death rate, and for the past 15 years is as follows: — Year. Nett. Death Rate. 1900 9.57 1907 9.35 1908 9.14 1909 9.47 1910 8.77 1911 9.58 1912 9.82 1913 9.34 1914 8.80 1915 12.2 1916 11.5 1917 10.9 1918 13.8 1919 10.5 1920 9.2 Further details regarding causes of death and details of other vital statistics are given in Tables I., III. and IV. on pages 18, 20 and 21. — 5 — NUMBER OF DEATHS 1897-1920 FROM THE SEVEN PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES.
