BOROUGH OF ACTON ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TOGETHER WITH THE REPORT ON THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS FOR THE YEAR 1952 BOROUGH OF ACTON ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TOGETHER WITH THE REPORT ON THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS FOR THE YEAR 1952 ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1952 Public Health Department, Town Hall, Acton, W.3. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Acton. Ladies and Gentlemen, I submit the Annual Report of the health of the Borough of Acton for the year 1952. One notes from the statistics of the Borough that the death rate of children under one year of age is 18.6 per 1,000 live births. This figure is extremely low, the figure for England and Wales being 27.6. For the last fifty years the infantile death rate has been falling; the reason may be that theoretical knowledge in medicine is being applied in a practical manner to maternal and ichild welfare matters, and to environmental hygiene. The birth rate is 13.21 per 1,000 and the death rate is 10.08 per 1,000 of the population. The births outnumbered the deaths even in this time of increased longevity of the population. There were no deaths attributable to infectious disease, but a child under two years died from gastro-enteritis. I should like to take this opportunity of expressing to the staff of the Public Health Department my appreciation for their cooperation and loyalty throughout the year. I remain, Your obedient servant, George E, B. Payne. 4 LIST OF CONTENTS Introduction 3 List of Staff 5 Section A.—Statistics and Social Conditions 6 Section B.—General Provision of Health Services in the Area 11 Section C.—Health Services Provided by Middlesex County Council 13 Section D.—Infectious and other Diseases, Scabies and other Conditions 17 Section E.—Housing 25 Section F.—Sanitary Circumstances of the Area 26 Section G Inspection and Supervision of Food 32 Section H.—Atmospheric Pollution 39 Annual Report of the School Medical Officer 43 5 STAFF Medical Officer of Health George E.

The Ministry of Health Emergency Medical Service provides a Pathological Service at the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital Laboratory at Ealing. The following Table gives the types, and number, of specimens submitted for examination. 12 Type No. of specimens examined Throat and Nose Swabs 383 Ear Swabs 3 Sputum 6 Faeces 128 Hair, Widals, etc. 7 Blood 2 Methylene Blue Reductase Tests on Milk ; and Ice-Cream 154 HOSPITAL PROVISION The Regional Hospital Board of the N.W. Metropolitan Area, which includes Acton, is responsible for hospital treatment of the sick. The most difficult cases for which to obtain treatment are old persons or chronic sick who become acutely ill or who are in the terminal stage of their illness. These types of cases need continuous care and treatment, and it is just these requirements which cannot be met in the home. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 No cases have been dealt with under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, but in those cases which have come to our notice it has been possible, by co-operating with the local hospital, to arrange for the persons concerned to be admitted. The Borough of Acton carried out its obligations under Section 50 of this Act, (i.e. the burial of bodies for which no other provision was made). 13 SECTION C HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY MIDDLESEX COUNTY COUNCIL AMBULANCE FACILITIES The Middlesex County Council is responsible for this service. NURSING IN THE HOME This service is administered locally by the Middlesex County Council. The number of sick persons under care in Acton during the year was 1,472 necessitating 27,259 visits. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE The new Clinic in Cloister Road, North Acton, was ready to open in January 1952, and the Child Welfare Sessions hitherto held at St. Gabriel's Church Hall in Noel Road were transferred as from the beginning of the year. The adaptation of the Cloister Road premises, formerly known as the North Acton Club, provided spacious treatment and reception rooms, and the popularity of the new clinic was soon felt in increased attendances. In addition to the improved facilities for the Maternity and Child Welfare services, Dental and Orthodontic clinics were provided, with full equipment, and rooms for speech therapy and minor ailment treatment were also included in the lay-out of the buildings. It became possible to arrange for separate clinic sessions for the two Health Visitors based on Cloister Road, and each district was given two sessions, one with, and one without a doctor in attendance. The average attendances per session for the five Clinics are given below, last year's figures being shown in brackets. Avenue Road 4 sessions weekly 22.8 (30.5) Trinity Way 2 sessions weekly 33.7 (32.5) Cloister Road 4 sessions weekly 29.0 (26.5) Palmerston Road 2 sessions weekly 30.8 (30.0) Steele Road 2 sessions weekly 28.4 (28.0) 14 HEALTH VISITING Number of visits during the year by all Health Visitors working in this area :— To expectant mothers—First visits 294 Total visits 422 To children under one year of age—First visits 899 Total visits 3,438 To children between the age of one and five years Total visits 4,279 INFANT WELFARE CLINICS Total number of children who first attended the Clinics during the year, and who, on the date of their first attendance were: Under one year of age 842 Between the ages of one and five 84 Total number of children in attendance at the end of the year: Under one year of age 835 Over one year 2,008 Total number of attendances at Centres during the year: By children under one year of age 13,765 By children between one and five years 6,168 MIDWIFERY SERVICE Domiciliary Midwifery was performed as in previous years by the Midwives of Queen Charlotte's Hospital. During 1952, 272 women were recommended for admission to Central Middlesex County Hospital for their confinements and most of these were accepted. ANTE-NATAL CLINICS In last year's report it was stated that one Ante-Natal session at Avenue Road had been temporarily discontinued, but it was found possible to re-start this clinic at Cloister Road and Trinity Way on alternate Friday mornings. By the end of October we were seeing such large numbers at Cloister Road that a weekly clinic was a necessity, so it was arranged that Friday mornings should be given over completely to Cloister Road, and the dwindling clinic 15 at Avenue Road should share Thursday mornings alternately with Trinity Way. Number of new Cases attending Clinics during year 638 Total number of attendances made 2,795 Average number attending per session 14 The arrangements made by women for their confinements are tabulated below: % Confined in Central Middlesex County Hospital 48.1 Confined in Queen Charlotte's Hospital 23.0 Confined in other Hospitals 7.1 Confined in Nursing Homes 1.6 Confined at home (Queen Charlotte's Midwives attending) 20.2 EXERCISE CLASS FOR MOTHERS The classes for expectant mothers were continued throughout the year, the total number of women attending in 1952 being 83 as against 61 in 1951. The number of attendances, however, showed a decrease, 565 as against 785 in 1951. PREMATURITY Emergency apparatus for this purpose were kept and maintained at the Fire Station, Gunnersbury Lane. The total number of premature live infants born at home during 1952 was four. One of these was nursed entirely at home and survived the first month, one died at home within the first half hour. The remaining two were transferred to hospital and survived. BIRTH CONTROL CLINIC As in previous years, arrangements for this purpose with the North Kensington Women's Welfare Association were continued. One clinic weekly was held at the Palmerston Road Hall, South Acton, a nominal fee being paid to the County Council for the use of the premises. Two new patients were referred for advice in 1952. 16 HOME HELP SCHEME At the end of the year there were 5 Full-time Home Helps, and 50 Part-time Staff. The following Table shows the number of cases booked and those actually attended: — Maternity: Total number of cases booked 56 Number of cases attended 42 Tuberculosis cases attended 26 Other cases attended 347 DAY NURSERIES During the latter part of the year, considerable changes took place in the administration of the Day Nursery scheme. The chief of these was the increase in the standard charge from 2/- to 9/per day, based on a scale of assessment of the means of each family, the minimum charge remaining at 2/- per day. Admission to the Nurseries was still governed by the list of priorities approved by the County Council and the Minister of Health, but applications for admission, assessment of charges, and appeals against assessments were now dealt with by the Joint Area Medical Officers, and the Day Nursery Panel was only concerned with appeals against refusal to admit and appeals after re-assess-| ment. A six-monthly review of cases accommodated in the nurseries was also to be taken by the Panel, but this would not fall due until the Spring of 1953. The new charges came into force on the 1st December, 1952, and a certain number of childen were withdrawn by their parents.: The four Acton Day Nurseries continued to operate through out the year, the accommodation remaining unchanged. The table given below shows accommodation, numbers on the registers a 31st December, and average attendance throughout the year.

(2) All infant welfare attenders were approached. (3) All children admitted to Day Nurseries were given protection. (4) Health Visitors combed their districts for children who did not attend Welfare Centres, and urged their protection. (5) Head Teachers gave forms of consent to new school entrants. (6) Prior to school medical inspections, questionnaires were sent to each parent asking, inter alia, whether the child had been inoculated. If the answer was in the negative a form of consent was sent to the parent. All immunised cases were followed up and, at the end of three years, each child was offered a boost dose. At the age of 11 years or over, this was preceded by a Schick test. All children under 5 who had not had the disease, were inoculated against Whooping Cough at the same time as they were inoculated against Diphtheria, i.e. they had three doses of protective material at monthly intervals. Owing to the fact that estimates of child population are no longer supplied by the Registrar General, it is not possible to give, 18 as in former years, the proportion of children immunised against Diphtheria, but the actual number at 31st December, is as follows: Children under 5 years of age 2,899 Children 5 to 15 years of age 7,352 The figures of work carried out during 1952 are given below: DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION, 1952 . Total number of under 5's inoculated 724 Total number of over 5's inoculated 62 Boost Dose after 3 years 1,313 Schick Test after 3 years—Negative 306 Positive 25 Primary Schick Test —Negative 9 Positive 3 19 CASES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE NOTIFIED DURING THE YEAR Notifiable Disease Cases notified in whole District at Ages — Years Ward Distribution Cases treated in Hospital At all Ages Under 1 1 to 2 3 to 4 5 to 9 10 to 14 15 to 24 25 to 44 45 to 64 Over 64 North East North West South South East South West East West Central j Diphtheria 1 — — — 1 — — — — — — 1 — — — — — — 1 Scarlet Fever 168 — 12 35 106 8 5 2 — — 27 15 14 9 20 33 32 18 54 Puerperal Pyrexia 8 — — — — — 2 6 — — 1 1 1 — 2 2 1 1 Measles 609 '25 132 141 299 7 1 3 1 — 159 19 46 42 47 125 88 83 5 Whooping Cough 65 8 15 24 16 1 1 — — — 16 — 6 4 5 19 9 3 3 Typhoid Fever 3 — — — — 1 1 1 — — — 1 — — — — 2 — 3 Food Poisoning 18 1 2 1 3 — 3 4 4 — — 4 2 1 1 9 — 1 3 Dysentery 7 1 — — — 1 — 4 1 — 1 — 2 — — 2 1 1 3 Pneumonia 31 1 — — 1 — 3 8 13 5 5 2 6 4 5 4 — 5 4 Poliomyelitis (paralytic) 2 — — — — — 1 1 — — — — — — — — 2 — 2 Poliomyelitis (non-paralytic) 1 — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — 1 Encephalitis 1 — — — 1 — — — — — — — — — — 1 — — 1 Meningitis 1 — — — • — — 1 — — — — — 1 — — — — — — Erysipelas 3 — — — — — — 1 2 — — — 1 — — — 1 1 1 Tuberculosis (Pulmonary) 52 1 1 — — 1 12 21 15 1 3 5 6 7 5 7 10 9 33 Tuberculosis (Non-Pul') 8 — — — 2 2 2 1 — 1 2 1 — 1 — 2 1 1 8 TOTALS 978 37 162 •202 429 21 32 52 36 7 214 52 85 68 85 205 147 122 119 20 INFECTIOUS DISEASE During the year there were 978 cases of infectious diseases notified, as compared with 1,430 during 1951. Of the total cases 609 were in respect of measles. Diphtheria. One case of Diphtheria occurred during the year in a girl aged 6 years who had not been immunized against the disease. The child recovered and was discharged from hospital after 9 weeks' treatment. Scarlet Fever. There were 168 cases of Scarlet Fever notified during the year, the highest number since 1937. Although the number of cases in recent years has remained quite high, the disease has been of a very mild character and there have been no deaths since 1934. Acute Encephalitis. A case of Acute Encephalitis following measles occurred during the year. The patient, a boy aged 5½ years, developed encephalomyelitis two days after the measles rash appeared. He was in a stupor for fourteen days and showed cerebellar signs. The child recovered completely after nine weeks in hospital. Poliomyelitis. Of the three cases of Poliomyelitis notified, two had paralysis. There were no deaths from this disease. Typhoid Fever. During the year three cases of Typhoid were notified:— A girl aged 10 years was admitted to hospital with suspected Cerebral Spinal Fever. Typhoid Fever was diagnosed and upon enquiries being made it was found that the patient had spent a holiday at West Mersea about one month before admission to 21 Hospital. Whilst on holiday she ate shrimps and drank the local water. I corresponded with the Medical Officer of Health of Colchester, and was subsequently informed by him that two cases had occurred in his area and investigation had shown that shellfish were involved. In each case cultures belonged to an untypeable V.I. strain. It can therefore be concluded with reasonable certainty that these cases came from the same source. A woman aged 33 years was admitted to hospital after being bitten by a dog. A blood culture revealed B. Typhoid. She was transferred to an infectious disease hospital where two widal tests were taken, which proved negative. The patient subsequently discharged herself from hospital to an address outside the Borough. A male aged 24 years developed Typhoid Fever after spending a holiday on the French Riviera. He regulary bathed near a sewer outlet. Food Poisoning. Eighteen cases of food poisoning were notified during the year, fourteen of which occurred during the September quarter. Eleven cases were associated with 3 minor outbreaks and the remainder were single cases. Salmonella organisms were the causative agent in 15 cases, the agent not being discovered in the remainder. 22 TUBERCULOSIS Age Periods NEW CASES DEATHS Respiratory Non-Respiratory Respiratory Non-Respiratory Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female 0 — 1 — — — — — — — 1 — — 1 — — — — — 5 — 1 — 2 2 — — — — 15 — 7 5 — 2 — — — — 25 — 5 6 — 1 1 — — — 35 — 6 3 — 1 — 2 — — 45 — 7 1 — — 2 — — — 55 — 5 2 — — 2 — — — 65 upwards 1 — — 1 — 1 — — 33 18 2 7 5 3 — — 23 STATEMENT OF PARTICULARS APPEARING ON THE REGISTER OF CASES OF TUBERCULOSIS—1952 Pulmonary NonPulmonary Total (a) Number of cases of tuberculosis on the Register at the commencement of the year 536 males 81 males 1,081 373 females 91 females (b) Number of cases notified for the first time during the year 33 males 2 males 60 18 females 7 females |(c) Number of cases previously removed from the Register which have been restored thereto during the year — males 1 male 2 — females 1 female (d) Number of cases added to the Register other than by notification during the year 25 males — males 44 15 males 4 females (e) Number of cases removed from the Register during the year 31 males 4 males 55 18 females 2 females" (f) Number of cases remaining on the Register at the end of the year 564 males 80 males 1,132 389 females 99 females SCABIES AND VERMINOUS CONDITIONS As in previous years, cases suffering from the above conditions have been referred to the Kensington Medicinal Baths for cleansing treatment. 24 Persons Treated for Body Lice January — — — — — 1 — — 1 1 April 1 i — October — — — — 1 — — — 1 2 1 November 1 1 December 1 1 totals — 2 — 1 — 3 6 3 Persons Treated for Scabies Month Central N.E.

Temporary Prefabricated Dwellings. Completed and occupied 31.12.52 250 New Permanent Dwellings. (1) Within the Borough: (a) Completed and occupied 81.12.52 698 (b) Contracts let or under construction 31.12.52 144 (c) Schemes in preparation 138 (2) Outside the Borough: Completed and occupied 31.12.52 435 1,665 Rebuilt War Destroyed Dwellings.

The whole of the population is supplied from the public water mains direct to each house and the supply has been satisfactory. Waste of water has been notified to the Metropolitan Water Board on 66 occasions and, in addition to saving a measure of water supply, these notifications have been the means of preventing nuisance from dampness in many cases. In addition to the public supply, there are three deep wells in the district, two at factory premises, and one at the Public Baths. Samples of water from these wells have been taken from time to time and on submission to bacteriological and chemical examinations have proved satisfactory. In the course of the year a total of 21 samples of water were submitted to the Council's analyst or pathologist for examination as to chemical or bacteriological content. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE All the dwelling houses are provided with water closets and are connected to the sewerage system which discharges, by an arrangement with the L.C.C., into the London sewers. Stormwater is filtered and emptied into the Thames. PUBLIC CLEANSING The amount of house refuse collected by the Council in 1952 was 15,262 tons and trade refuse collected amounted to 2,190 tons. All was removed to controlled shoots. In addition to the foregoing, 2,344 tons of salvage were sold. 27 RODENT CONTROL Test baiting of public sewers and treatment as necessary have been continued in accordance with the recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. The services of the Council's Rodent Destruction staff have been divided as occasion has demanded between destruction of newly discovered rats and mice by intensive treatment, and the regular visiting, examination and treatment of business premises. There is no serious infestation of rats or mice in the Borough, and there can be no doubt that this is largely due to the Council's policy and practice of maintenance treatment in business premises, particularly those where food for human consumption is manufactured or stored. Investigation, destruction and maintenance have entailed a total of 3,228 visits by the Rodent Operatives, 1,889 to business premises and 1,339 to dwellings, in addition to inspections by the Sanitary Inspectors as noted elsewhere. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 Under the above Act, fifteen premises are registered for the manufacture of articles of upholstery, toys, etc., and two premises were licensed for the storing of Rag Flock. In the course of inspections it has been noted that Rag Flock and other Filling Materials ; are stored and used so as to be maintained in hygienic condition. COMPLAINTS The number of complaints registered at the counter was 1,463. INSPECTION OF FACTORIES The number of factories in the Borough has lessened to 646, and these have been subject to inspection by the Sanitary Inspectors to ascertain that the provisions of the Factories Act, 1937, and regulations as to sanitary accommodation are complied with. The usual work of inspection of factory canteens has been 28 tained, and advice given as necessary as to fitness or otherwise of food for human consumption. The home addresses of 91 outworkers engaged in work at home for Factories within and outside the Borough, have been visited to ascertain hygienic conditions and freedom from infectious disease.

Under the direction of the various Departments of the Ministry of Food, much inferior food material is received into the Borough for manufacturing purposes subject to control by the Local Authority, and the Sanitary Inspectors carry out necessary examinations to ensure that only sound material is used; this accounts generally for the bulk surrenders of meat. Two large wholesale grocery Depots are within the Borough, and hence surrenders of canned and packeted goods are made to this Authority; these surrenders constitute the major part of such foodstuff noted. The following list collated for convenience shows some details of the surrendered food-stuffs: Bacon 256 lbs. Bakers Sundries 19 cwts. 2 qrs. 3 lbs. ,, ,, 48 packets Cereals 44 packets ,, 128 cwts. 78 lbs. Cheese, processed 19 boxes Confectionery Sundries 19 cwts 60 lbs. Confectionery 1 lb.

Vegetables 6,157 tins FOOD COMPLAINTS There were 36 complaints as to unsound food, etc, and in three cases the Council instituted legal proceedings. A firm of bakers pleaded guilty to selling a loaf containing a cigarette end. A fine of £5 was imposed and three guineas costs Were awarded to the Council. A dairy firm pleaded guilty to selling partially baked rolls in a mouldy condition. The firm was fined £20 and ten guineas costs were awarded to the Council. 34 A firm of bakers pleaded guilty to selling a cake containing a nail. A fine of £35 was imposed and the Council were awarded five guineas costs. MILK The number of dairies in the Borough has been reduced to nine on account of greater wholesale distribution of milk in bottles from large bottling depots to local depots, for delivery by roundsmen, or over the counter in milk shops. Of 43 samples taken throughout the Borough and submitted to the Pathological Laboratory of the Ministry of Health, there was only one failure in respect of the methylene blue test, while all phosphatase tests were satisfactory. The wholesale, pasteurising and bottling centre in Bollo Lane has continued in operation without cause for complaint, and 18 empty bottles taken from the filling lines for examination as to sterility, were found to be sterile. The following licences were granted under the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations 1949 and 1950, and the Milk (Special Designation (Raw Milk) Regulations 1949 and 1950. Dealers Licences:- Tuberculin Tested Milk 20 Pasteurised Milk 29 Sterilised Milk 28 Supplementary Licences:- Tuberculin Tested Milk 12 Pasteurised Milk 13 Sterilised Milk 13 115 ICE-CREAM The number of manufacturers of ice-cream in the Borough isi now 6, while there are 112 premises where ice-cream is not manu-i factured, but where the commodity is sold in the main from prepacked stocks. During the year 109 samples were taken, 55 of icecream manufactured in the Borough, and 54 from shops or itinerant vendors trading in ice-cream manufactured outside the Borough, i 35 The grading of samples noted below and expressed in percentages indicates the very good standard maintained of ice-creams manufactured in the Borough. Grade I. 89.2% Grade II. 5.4% Grade III. 5.4% Grade IV. — Premises, plant, processing and storage conditions are well and satisfactorily maintained. SYNTHETIC CREAM Two samples of synthetic cream were taken from a bakery following a complaint from another local authority that cream in a Chocolate Eclair contained B Coli, Faecal Type. These samples were satisfactory.

Within the last two months of 1951, because of numerous outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease in the country, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries made a large controlled area under the Foot and Mouth Disease (Controlled Area Restrictions) General Order of 1938 which included Acton. This area was still in being on January 1st and during the whole of the year the Borough was included in one Infected Area and four Controlled Areas which lasted altogether for 134 days. The longest and last inclusion extended from June 2nd to August 10th. In the period up to May 7th, all movements of pigs within or into Controlled Areas — except those from collecting centres or markets — had to be licensed by the Acton Local Authority, and this involved the checking of the applications to ensure that the proposed movement was permissible. Owing to the considerable numbers of infected areas within the controlled area, this was rather a complicated procedure and entailed the completing and issuing of over 2,000 licences. After May 7th, the regulations were varied and it was then possible for Movement Licences to be issued either at the sending or receiving end. This relieved the pressure on the office and only some 122 Controlled Area Movement Licences were issued locally. However, during the inclusion of the borough in a Foot and Mouth Infected Area from 15th June to 27th June, the licensing procedure reverted to normal and over 800 licences were issued. For the whole of the periods during which the borough was included in the various areas, two additional inspectors were detailed for duty at the slaughterhouse for the purposes of antemortem inspection, receiving and examining licences and supervising the cleansing and disinfecting of vehicles. During the year, a total of 5,135 licences involving the movement of 52,304 pigs were received. These animals were carried, in some 1,700 vehicles which were cleansed and disinfected before leaving the slaughterhouse. These duties entailed the working of a considerable amount of unavoidable overtime by the inspectorial staff—some 750 hours —as the movement of animals took place almost every day and all day often up to 10 p.m. 39 SECTION H ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION The seven lead peroxide and three deposit gauge stations, established last year, continued in operation throughout the year and give, for the first time, pollution figures for a complete year. ESTIMATION OF ATMOSPHERIC SULPHUR BY THE LEAD PEROXIDE METHOD The table on page 40 gives the monthly figures for each station in the Borough for the years 1951 and 1952. The station giving the highest average monthly figure was again Bashley Road— 2.10, but the highest month's reading was given by the Town Hall station—4.24. Again, the lowest average figure was obtained at Acacia Road — 1.69, and the lowest month's figure at Kendal Avenue—0.56. It will be noted that the amount of sulphur pollution increased throughout the whole of the borough when comparing the average figures with those of the previous year. The figures for the last two months of the year showing a very marked increase over those for 1950. The monthly average figure for all stations is given in the form of a graph on page 41. DEPOSIT GAUGES The monthly figures for the deposit of atmospheric solids is given on page 42. The highest average monthly deposit—27.02 tons/square mile—and the highest month's deposit—36.85 tons— were again obtained at Bashley Road, and the lowest average monthly deposit—15.01 tons and lowest month's deposit—7.82 tons —as last year, were at Kendal Avenue. As the deposit gauges were not installed until August 1951, it is only possible to compare the results for the last five months of each year. This comparison shows a slight increase in total deposit at the Town Hall and slight reductions at the other two stations. The percentage of combustible material in the solids deposited during this five months period was 18%, an improvement of some 3% over the figure for 1951. However, the figure for the whole year was 20%. The average monthly deposit over the year for the three stations is given in the form of a graph on page 41. As the deposit gauges act as rain gauges, it might be of interest to note the average monthly rainfall, and these figures are given in the table on page 42. 40 ESTIMATION OF ATMOSPHERIC SULPHUR BY LEAD PEROXIDE INSTRUMENTS Weight of S03 in Milligrams per 100 Square Centimetres per day.
