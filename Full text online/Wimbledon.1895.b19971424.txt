URBAN SANITARY DISTRICT OF WIMBLEDON COUNTY OF SURREY. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER of HEALTH For the Year ending December Jist, 1895. wimbledon: PRINTED BT EDWIN TRIM, HOMEFIELD ROAD, AND HILL ROAD. Report of the Medical Officer of Health For the Year ending 31s/! December, 1895. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year ended the 31st December, 1895. \ The total number of births registered was 857 (417 males and 440 females), equal to a birth-rate of 27"6 per thousand per annum. The birth-rate in England and Wales for the same period is given at 30'3 in the Report of the Registrar General. The total number of deaths registered was 377 (180 males and 197 females), equal to a death-rate of 12"1 per thousand living per annum, taking the population at 31,000 (the estimated population at Midsummer, 1895). After making the usual corrections as indicated at the bottom of Table 3, the total number of deaths properly belonging to the District is found to be 374, and the death-rate 12 06. The death-rate for England and Wales for the same period is given as 18'7. Infant mortality is represented by a ratio of 119 deaths under one year of age to 1,000 registered births. Between the ages of 1 and 60 there were 174 deaths, and 101 deaths of persons aged 60 years and upwards. Influenza caused 14 deaths against 10 last year, 20 in 1893, and 18 in 1892. There were 38 deaths from Bronchitis, 26 from Pneumonia, 16 from Phthisis, 29 from Cancer (see Table 6 which shows deaths from all causesj. The number of deaths from Zymotic Diseases, including Influenza, was 63, viz.:—-from Measles, 2; Whooping Cough, 11; 4 Diphtheria, 16; Typhoid Fever, 1; Membranous Croup, 2; Influenza, 14; Diarrhoea, 15; Erysipelas, 1; Puerperal Fever, 1. The death-rate from all Zymotic Diseases was 2 03 per 1,000 of the population per annum. Table A shows for the last year and the 4 preceding years the births, deaths, death-rates, and the deaths at certain ages and from specified causes. Table B shows for the same years the number of Infectious cases notified and the deaths from each notifiable disease. Table C shows the death-rates from Zymotic Diseases for the last 10 years. Table 5 shows the localities in which all the notified cases of Infectious Diseases have occurred.

The greater number of cases occurred in the months of June, July, and November (see Table 2), when 44 cases were notified. The total number of cases notified was 76, of which 45 were treated in the Infectious Diseases Hospital and the remainder in their own homes. There were no deaths from this disease during the year. In June an outbreak occurred in the Cottenham Park Schools. I examined the scholars as soon as the first cases were notified and discovered two of them to be desquamating freely. I at once took steps to have these two children removed to the Isolation Hospital, the School closed and disinfected, and other necessary precautions taken. Altogether 17 children in 9 households were attacked. I also thought it advisable to prevent children from Cottenham Park attending other Schools, with the result that the outbreak was limited to a small area. 6 DIPHTHERIA. Thirty-seven cases were notified during the year and 16 deaths registered against 43 in the preceding year and 10 deaths. Of those 27 were treated in the Infectious Diseases Hospital, of which 9 died and 18 recovered. There were, however, 2 other deaths from Diphtheria in the Hospital, among the Diphtheria patients remaining in from the previous year, making a total of 11 deaths from this disease in the Hospital during the year. The remaining 10 were treated in their own homes, and of these 5 proved fatal. Three of the cases occurred in new houses where the Sanitary arrangements were in good order, and no cause could be found for the occurrence of the disease. One case was probably due to the bad odours which emanated from a filthy ashpit close to the back door. At the houses where all the other cases occurred the drains were found to be very defective. Two cases of Membranous (.'roup were notified, and both proved fatal. TYPHOID FEVER. Fourteen cases were notified and 1 death occurred, against 13 last year and 3 deaths.. No cases occurred in March, April, and August. In .January 3 cases occurred, the first in Hartfield Road, a young man, aged 29 years, who committed suicide when delirious. The second a man of the same age living in Nelson Road, and the third a young woman, aged 19, in Edge Hill; this was a case imported from London. Serious Sanitary defects were found in the first two houses. In February a case occurred in the Lambton Road, the origin of the disease could not be traced. The patient (a young man of 26) recovered. 7 In May a boy of 15, living in Graham Road, was notified as suffering from this disease, which had developed after a serious attack of Influenza. The Sanitary arrangements at the house were in good order. In June two cases occurred, one an imported one from London, the other a boy aged 12 years, living in Hartfield Road, at a house where the drainage was found to be very defective. In July an imported case from London was notified in Queen's Road. In September a mild case was notified from North Road. The origin of the disease in this case (a child of 2 years) could not be traced. In October an imported case from Hythe was reported from Lake Road. In November a young lady, living in South Park Road, was notified as suffering from Enteric Fever. It was ascertained that she contracted the disease in London. In December a mild case was notified from Wycliffe Road (a boy of 14), the disease could not be traced. It will be seen that of the 14 cases notified 5 were imported from other Districts. INFECTIOUS DISEASES HOSPITAL. During the year 73 persons were admitted to the Hospital, 45 of whom were suffering from Scarlet Fever, 27 from Diphtheria, and 1 from Chicken Pox which had been notified as Small Pox. All the Scarlet Fever cases recovered; of the 27 Diphtheria cases admitted during the year 9 died and 18 recovered. Two other deaths from Diphtheria occurred however in the Hospital, both these were patients who were admitted in December, 1894. The Chicken Pox case was discharged 3 days after admission. 8 The following are the cases of Infectious Diseases admitted o during each month of the year. Diseases. January. February March.

A cab was disinfected after it had been used for the conveyance of an infected case. 9 Miss Warren, the Matron, resigned at the beginning of the year, and Miss Pearson was appointed in her stead. On October the 3rd a letter was written to the Sanitary Inspector by the Medical Officer, Dr. Little, who requested that an examination should be made of the Hospital to ascertain its Sanitary condition, as bad odours were noticeable in different parts of the building. This letter was laid before the Sanitary Committee the same evening, and the Sanitary Officer was instructed to inspect and report. The following was Mr. Mayne's report:— October 10th, 1895. To the Chairman and Members of the Sanitary Committee. Gentlemen, Infectious Diseases Hospital. As instructed by the Committee at their last meeting, I have made an inspection of the Hospital and have to report as follows:— Site. The Hospital stands on a wet site, with apparently no subsoil drainage; the natural fall of the ground on the East side is towards the building, and as this ground is that part of the Sewage Farm which is irrigated with untreated sewage, the site is rendered not only damp but offensive. Cellars. The cellars, which are situated below the Matron's room and the large Ward, are paved with porous bricks, and on opening up, I found three cesspools, two of which contain stagnant water and one liquid sewage. The odours in the cellars from decomposing woodwork and the cesspools were most offensive. The roots of a tree growing beneath the floor had upheaved the bricks into the form of an arch and the space thus formed was full of water. Between the cellar roof (which is composed of loose boards) and the floor of the Matron's room is a 10 thick layer of odourous dust, caused by dry rot and the occupancy by many generations of rats Matron's The odour complained of in both these rooms is more Room and noticeable when fires are lighted, as the cellar air is then Large ° Ward. drawn into them through the crevices of the boards, and the occupants are then living in an atmosphere of warm moist and foul air which can only be prejudicial to health. Sanitary The Sanitary arrangements are not as they should be. Arrange- An attempt has been made to reconstruct a portion of ments- drainage, but still a good deal remains to be done to render them satisfactory. For instance:—The drip sink on the passage floor leading to the kitchen, down which the bath water is thrown, has an untrapped waste pipe directly connected with the drain which, therefore, acts as a ventilator to it, thus there is direct communication between the drain and the interior of the Hospital. Again, in one of the upstairs roo;ns a bath is used, with an outlet which discharges into a long length of untrapped, foul zinc pipe; this pipe is broken off at the lower end, so instead of discharging over the gully as it is supposed to do, the soapy water has been soaking into the earth against the walls and has rendered it a sodden mass. This pipe also acts as an inlet ventilator to the house and the air on its passage through must become foul; then, the rainwater pipe which takes the water from the roof of the bay window of the Matron's room discharges into an old large sized dip-trap which is full of black, stagnant water. The servants' water-closet is of the wash-out type and foul. I have not had time to complete my inspection of the drainage. 11 Remarks. The general surroundings of the Hospital are insalubrious as the Committee are aware, and further comment on my part as to this point is needless. Most of the woodwork is affected by dry-rot (the smell of which is noticeable in every room). The whole building is in a very dilapidated state, the roofs are leaky and rain water finds an entrance at many places. The Hospital fails in ever}' way to come up to what is required in a habitable building. 1.—The site is very wet. 2.—The construction does not insure perfect dryness of the roofs, walls, and foundations. 3.—The system of drainage is unsatisfactory. 4.-—The ventilation is imperfect. I consider the building to be quite beyond repair and think that any expenditure on it would be money wasted. I suggest that the Hospital be closed, and Patients treated in the Iron Hospital until some further proper accommodation is provided. A house could be rented for the nursing staff in the Gap Road, at a small cost, and the present Hospital furniture could be used for it. I may add that knowing now the insanitary condition of the Hospital, I should, as the Sanitary Inspector for the District, have great hesitation in advising parents to send their children into it, for the Sanitary condition of thenown homes could scarcely in any case be worse than that of the Hospital. I produce a bottle of the sewage taken from the cesspool in the cellar. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN W. MAYNE. 12 A Special Meeting of the Sanitary Committee was called on the 10th of October, when the report was read. The Hospital was closed the following day, the Patients transferred to the Iron building, and a house rented in the Gap Road for the nursing staff as suggested. The Council gave much consideration to the question of a site for the proposed Isolation Hospital, and finally decided 011 a site outside their district, which is far removed from houses and all sources liable to become a nuisance. The site is on fairly high ground and appears in every way suitable. It is to be hoped that the preliminary treaties in connection with the purchase will be satisfactorily arranged and all the matters necessary to start the work got through as soon as possible. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890. In my report for 1894 I stated that a notice had been served under the " Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890," on the owner of South Place, and that nothing had been done to remedy the defects at the end of the year. Since then certain improvements have been carried out. A notice under the above Act was served in September on the occupier of "Thatched Cottage" in the Durnsford Road (as the owner could not be found). This house was in a very bad condition, being damp, dilapidated, and without proper drainage. As the notice was not complied with, a closing order was applied for and granted on the 18th of December. The cottage is now closed. A similar notice was served the same month on the owners of Nos. 1 to 23, Berkeley Road. All these houses were in a very dilapidated and insanitary condition. The necessary work for putting the houses into a habitable state is now in progress. FACTORY & WORKSHOPS ACT. Several of the Workshops have been inspected, and in cases where Infectious Diseases have occurred in the homes of the 13 workers, steps have been taken to prevent such workers returning to business until all fear of Infection was over. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS, & MILKSHOPS. The Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops have been inspected periodically and at intervals, and, with a few exceptions, have been found to be kept in accordance with the regulations. There are 37 of these premises in the District, 4 having been registered during the year. In 2 cases notices were sent for Cowsheds to be limewashed. In 3 cases the Milk Utensils were found to be improperly kept. The usual notices were served on the owners and were complied with. SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The Slaughter Houses have been inspected frequently and found to be kept in accordance with the Bye-laws. There are only 6 Slaughter Houses in the District, and 3 of these are not much used. BAKEHOUSES. The Bakehouses, 22 in number, were inspected during the year. Of these, 2 required whitewashing, notices were served on the owners in each case and were complied with. Throughout the year there has been little to complain of with regard to the way in which these premises have been kept. PIGGERIES. Pig-keeping has again been the cause of a number of complaints. In May, a Piggery at the Old Farm, containing 23 pigs, was abolished. A Piggery, containing 25 pigs, in the Garfield Road was complained of in the summer. On inspection it was found that 14 the styes were improperly constructed and that there was no proper drainage. A notice was served on the owner to remove the pigs and pull down the styes within a specified time; the notice was complied with. Summonses were issued in the Wimbledon Police Court against two pig-keepers in respect of the nuisances caused by their Piggeries in Cottenham Park, and both were fined small fines on their undertaking to remove their pigs and abolish the styes. In December, a small Piggery in the Durnsford Road was abolished. In consequence of an outbreak of Swine Fever in a large Piggery in Durnsford Road in December, over 300 pigs were slaughtered and buried, and the styes burnt. Most of the pig-owners in the District are men who have been carrying on their trade in the Metropolitan Area and have had to move further afield. As Wimbledon is now become a largely populated suburb, it will be well when bye-laws can be made to entirely prevent pig-keeping from being carried on as a trade in the District. OVERCROWDING. A bad case of overcrowding existed at 27, Dundonald Road in February, 2 small rooms were used by a family of 8 people as a bedroom and kitchen. The rooms were in a filthy state and smelt very badly. The nuisance was abated on notice being served. A Private School in the Latimer Road was inspected in October and found to be grossly overcrowded. The room, which has a floor area of 200 3 square feet and a cubic capacity of 1703 0G cubic feet, was occupied on the date of inspection by 33 scholars, of the average age of 8 years, and 1 teacher; thus the floor area per occupant was 5'8 square feet and the cubic space 48 9 cubic feet after making the deduction of 37'6 cubic feet (the space occupied by the bodies of the children). This School 15 was closed, the Proprietress agreeing to take a more suitable house. Three other cases of overcrowding were abated on notices being served. There is, unfortunately, a great deal of overcrowding in South Wimbledon. In many cases, 2 families occupy a house which is suitable only for one. This is due to the very high rents demanded by owners of cottage property. The earnings of the working classes do not allow of their setting apart more than a certain sum for rent, so that a man with a large family is often unable to pay for more than a share of a small house. WATER SUPPLY. Owing to the Lambeth Water Works Company having sunk a deep well at Streatham and having fixed powerful pumps, several Artesian Wells in Wimbledon were completely drained, and in others the water level much lowered. This action of the Water Company necessitated the laying on of water from their own mains to about 116 houses which were formerly supplied from these wells. The result is beneficial, as in many cases the water from these wells was not sufficient for the number of houses it was supposed to supply. UNSOUND FOOD Several cases of fish have been condemned and destroyed as being unfit for human consumption. No action was taken, as the fishmongers themselves drew the attention of the Sanitary Officer to the state of the fish on delivery to them. A quantity of bad shrimps, which were exposed for sale by a Hawker in the Broadway, were seized by the Inspector and condemned by a Justice, who ordered them to be destroyed. This was done. The man was not prosecuted. However, he has not since hawked his goods in the District. 16 SANITARY WORK. The nuisances dealt with are summarized in Table 1. The drains of 162 houses and premises have been entirely reconstructed and laid to stand the water-test, with manholes for inspection purposes and efficient inlet and outlet ventilation. The following blocks of houses have been re-drained, the main drains were put in in most cases by the District Council at their own cost. Nos. 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, Durham Road. „ 1, 3, 5, Wandle Road. „ 6, 7, 8, 9, The Pavement, Haydon's Road. „ 69, 71, 73, 75, 79, Deburgh Road. „ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, Lancaster Place. „ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, Pelham Road. „ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, Railway Place. „ 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, Milton Road. „ 29, 31, 33, Merton Road. „ 1, 3, 5, Effra Road. „ 19, 21, 23, South Road. „ 50, 52, 54, Hubert Road. „ 57, 59, 61, Hartfield Crescent. „ 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71,73, Palmerston Road. „ 115,117, 119,121,123,125,127,129,131, 133,135,137,139, 141, 143, Russell Road, besides these several pairs of houses have beeu re-drained and many single ones. There has been little trouble in getting the necessary work done in the cottage properties, as most of the owners recognise the necessity of sound drainage, and now that the Council are compelled to put in the main drains at their own expense, property owners more willingly carry out the notices served upon them. I may mention that an improvement is about to be effected in the block of 35 houses between the Broadway and Hartfield Road. These houses at present drain into a defective sewer at 17 their rear. This sewer is badly constructed, has no fall, the joints are very leaky, and it is blocked nearly its whole length. Notices have been served on the owners, and the houses are to be redrained into the Broadway and Hartiield Road sewers respectively. Some of the work is now in progress. It will be seen that a large amount of useful work has been carried out. I have, as in former years, to express my entire approval of the manner in which Mr. Mayne has performed the arduous and increasing duties which have devolved upon him, and I consider him a very valuable officer. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, E. POCKLINGTON, M.O.H. 18 TABLE 1.

The words " Urban " " Rural, " or " Metropolitan" must be inserted in the appropriate space in the heading, according as the District is Urban or Rural, or is within the Metropolitan Area. 4. The " Localities " adopted for the purpose of these statistics should be areas of known population; such as parishes, groups of parishes, townships, or wards. , As stated at the head of the first column in eacli Table, Public Institutions should be regarded as separate localities, and the deaths in them should be separately recorded. Workhouses, Hospitals, Infirmaries, Asylums, and other establishments into which numbers of people, and especially of sick people are received, are Public Institutions for the purpose of these statistics. 5. The deaths which have to be classified in this table (3), and summed up in the horizontal line of " Totals, " are the whole of those registered as having actually occurred in the several localities comprised within the Division or District. But the registered number of deaths frequently requires correction before it can give an exact view of the mortality of a Division or District; and the two lowest horizontal lines are provided for the purpose of enabling Medical Officers of Health to indicate, to the best of their ability, what the extent of such corrections should be. Details concerning the corrective figures, e.g., the institutions that have been considered, or the particular localities to which corrections apply, may appear in the text of the leport or in supplementary tables. Area and Population of the District or Division to which this Return relates. Area in Acres 3,173 Population (1891) 25,758 DEATH RATES. General 121 per 1000 Population estimated to middle of 1895. Infant (under one year of age) 119 1 per 1000 Births Registered. In recording the facts under the various headings of Tables 3 and 4, attention has been given to the notes endorsed on the Tables.
