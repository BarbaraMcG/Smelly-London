To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District of Barking Town. Mrs. Clark and Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you the Annual Report for the year 1919. During the year instructions have been received from the Ministry of Health, from which it appears that a complete survey of the district is desired, so that a picture of the needs of the population can be obtained. Such a document, however, would be of rather voluminous character, and on that account would not be read. It is proposed to focus attention particularly on three subjects, Housing, Infectious Disease and Hospital Accommodation, and Maternity and Child Welfare. The remaining details of the year's work will be made as brief as possible. On 31st October, 1919, a return was submitted to the Housing Commissioner as to the condition of the town and its needs. The following statement covers the main points of the return:— 4 HOUSING AND TOWN PLANNING ACT, 1919. Section I.- Prevailing Conditions Affecting Shortage of Houses. Industries. 1. Particulars as to the staple industries of the district (or of any parish or part of the district). The district can scarcely be said to have any staple industries. During- the last 20 years it has been extensively developed, but a large proportion of the residents proceed daily to work in and around London. There are, however, the following established industries, viz.:— The Beckton Gas Works of the Gas, Light & Coke Co., various Chemical, Engineering, Asbestos, Match, Tin Box, Paint and Varnish, and India Rubber Works. 2. Particulars of any anticipated industrial development. The geographical position of Barking on the Eastern fringe of London, with over three miles of frontage to the River Thames and Barking Creek, would appear to make the development of the District for industrial purposes imminent. Enquiries from manufacturers of all kinds are constantly being received for particulars of factory sites, etc. 3. Particulars of any considerable reduction which may be cipated in the number of persons employed in any industry in the district.—Nil. 6 Population. 4. Pre-war population (1914) 34,685 5. Average annual increase of population for the five years before the war 1,050 6. Estimated present population 35,383 7.

Measures already taken as regards the area. Further action to be taken by Local Authority for dealing with the area (give approximate dates). Contemplated measures for re-housing displaced Population. The vital statistics for the four years prior to the War are unfavourbte, viz.:— Infantile mortality, 283 per 1.000 as against 110 for the whole district. Zymotic Death Rate, 5.1 per 1,000 as against 3.9 for the whole district. Total Death Rate, 17.5 per 1,000 as against 13.5 for the whole district. The houses are badly arranged, the sites of the houses are not concreted, rooms are very small, roofs and walls are defective, a certain number of the houses are without forecourts and others without back yards. Notices under the Public Health Act, and the Housingand Town Planning Act, to execute repairs, etc. It is proposed to apply for an Order for a Reconstruction Scheme before March, 1921. The policy of the Council as to whether they shallbe re-housed on the site or alternatively offered other houses to be erected on the F.astbury or Upney Estates, has not yet been decided. 10 Section IV.—Insanitary Houses (other than houses in unhealthy areas of which particulars are given in Section III). Prevailing Conditions. 1. How many inhabited houses in the district which are not and cannot be made fit for human habitation? 25 2. Number of persons inhabiting these houses? 146 3. How many houses are already subject to (a) Closing Orders? None (b) Demolition Orders? None i. How many houses are seriously defective but can be made habitable? 63 Proposed Action. 5. What immediate action is contemplated by the Local Authority with regard to (a) houses which are not and cannot be made fit for human habitation? They will be closed as soon as other housing accommodation is provided. (b) houses which are seriously defective but can be made habitable They will be dealt with under Sections 15 and 17 of the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909. 6. Within what time is it contemplated that conditions will be such as to warrant the demolition of the houses which are not and cannot be made fit for human habitation? Twelve months. 11 Section VI.—Scheme of the Barking Town Urban District Council for the provision of New Houses under Section I. of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1919. The scheme should include any proposals which have already been submitted for approval as assisted schemes. 1.

Eastbury Estate Scheme. U. Upney Farm Scheme. There are two additional schemes (Greatfields and Ledge Lane) in respect of which it is, at the moment, impossible to state the number of houses they will accommodate. Total number of houses and separate apartments 1,089 2. Approximate number of existing empty houses to be acquired and :— (i) Made suitable for housing the working classes Nil (ii) Converted into flats for the working classes Nil Approximate number of families to be housed under (i) and (ii) 1,098 12 3.

Approximate localities in which land is to be acquired. The Eastbury, Upney Farm, and Lodge Lane Estates adjoin the eastern boundary of the developed portion of the district. Greatfields is south of the developed portion of the district and adjoins the Council's existing Housing Estate. 6. Time within which it is proposed that the scheme (or if the scheme is to be carried out by instalments, each part of the scheme) is to be carried into effect:— Part of Scheme. Approximate Date for Completion. Eastbury Estate July, 1921. Upney Farm Estate July, 1922. 7. Particulars of any measure necessary, as part of the scheme, for the preservation of existing erections of architectural, historic or artistic interest, or for the preservation of the natural amenities of the locality. Eastbury House, an Elizabethan mansion, has already been acquired by the National Trust. The lay-out of the estate has been planned with a view to leaving an open space round it. 8. Any other provisions (including provisions for joint action with any other Local Authority). 9. Is it anticipated that the scheme may subsequently require to be amended? If so, any relevant considerations should be stated. It is probable that sites for schools and other buildings will be required on the Eastbury and Upney Farm Estates. The layout of the former estate may require amendment. 13 The following particulars give the actual number of occupants per room in such dwelling-houses where a birth occurred. It is seen that out of 757 houses, 115 were overcrowded on the basis of more than two per room. Occupants per Room. Rooms per Tenement. Occupants per Tenement.

The following table gives the number of cases of notifiable ailments that occurred during the year, with age, district, and number removed to Hospital. Taking the points in o.rder and comparing with previous years, the following will be noted :— Scarlet Fever shows a slight tendency to rise, and gives some reason to believe that the disease will become prevalent during the fall of the current year. Diphtheria. --The sequence with respect to this disease is marked, and justified the prophecy which has since been verified that the disease was likely to maintain its position. The figures fo.r the four years are 86, 126, 93, and 98. Diphtheria was present in epidemic form in 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906 and 1907. From 1908 to 1914 the cases average about 25 each year. Under ordinary circumstances the present year should be the last of the series of excessive prevalence, and should be followed by four or five years quiescence. In view of the housing conditions it would be unwise to modify administrative action on this expectation. 15 Cases of Infectious Diseases Notified during the Year 1919. Notifiable Disease.

As this must necessarily depend to some extent on the increased number of births, there seems little evidence to believe that venereal disease has materially increased as a result of demobilisation.

The numbers for the last four years are:—318, 924, 534, and 369. Formal notification ceased at the end of the year 1919. Analysis of the successive waves and the type of population attacked is of interest. During the year it was decided to apply to the Ministry for consent to continue formal notification. This application has not been made, as it necessarily depended on certain other services which were the subjects of negotiation at the time. Draft regulations have now been issued and have been granted to certain areas. The main points appear to be the limitation of notification to those aged five years and under, and the necessity of supplementing notification by a nursing service. 17 Measles. Barking. 1916.

(months) Standard deviation — 1.184 + — 100 .610 + — .11 (deaths) From investigation of the curve'from 1917, it is found that B2 = 4.2 and B2 = 4.73, and that F=-.42, hence the curve is markedly skew, that is, the rise is steeper than the fall. A curve that is to be expected from a heterogenious population, on one which consists of groups of varying size. (The groups in a civil population are the families.) It has been shewn that density of the population is a factor in the rate of spread, hence the chance of infection in the family, should one member become infected, is greater than the chance of an individual member receiving infection from general sources. The ratio can be expressed as the square of the number of the unit. Thus, a family of two might each derive infection from general sources, and then infect each 18 other in the home, hence the chance of such a unit occurring in our record is 22-4, and similarly the chance of a family of ten occurring is 102 = 100. Thus, a family of ten should be attacked at 2(5 times the rate of a family of two. Hence the curve of incidence can be regarded as a number of curves which depict the rate of spread in a population of a density similar to families of i, 2, 3, etc. If these are superimposed, assuming a normal distribution in each case, a skew curve will be produced. Actual observation shows that the number over ten years of age per household during the rise of an epidemic of measles was 2.7 (300) and in the fall -.4 (300), a significant difference. The number of children under ten were approximately equal.

There is possibly some error or omission dependent on the fact that notification depends on the presence of the disease, and also on whether life i's threatened or not, and as that risk decreases as the child gets older, it may be reasonable to expect that the notifications at the earlier ages more closely reflect the age incidence at that time. Still in spite of these factors it is obvious that the age incidence has changed in the four years under consideration, a fact that must lie due to, firstly, the susceptibility of the population has altered owing to previous attack, or secondly, the organism has changed in character. Now with respect to the first, there are certain categories to which this cannot apply. Thus, the children of one year and under in 1917 and 1918 are not in any way different from the group of a similar age in 1916, and the same applies, in a lesser degree, to those under two in 1918, yet the proportional number attacked is different. It may, however, be contended that owing to the rising immunity of the older children, the chance of infection being introduced into the home has decreased. That will not explain why the epidemic as a whole caused considerably more discomfort in 1917 than in 1916, and yet the relative number attacked under one year was less in 1917 than in 1916. Unless we assume that the organism has changed during the course of the year, we are led into considerable difficulty. Pneumonia and Influenzal Pneumonia. This disease became notifiable during the year, and 73 cases were reported. The order was, of course, dependent upon the epidemic of 1918-1919. Although sporadic cases are still occurring, it is hardly likely to rise to any high level for a number of years. It is possible now to form a fair estimate of the proportion attacked during the epidemic. The figures are estimates and are based on information derived from various sources :— 21 1st WAVE. 1918. 2nd WAVE. 1918. 3rd WAVE. 1919. Week ending. Cases. Deaths. Week ending. Cases. Deaths.

This percentage, though varying in different factories and services, is a fair all-round estimate. With respect to school children the position is more interesting. During the week ending September 28th batches of 20 school children were taken attending school, and the following numbers were found to have temperatures between 99 and 100 degrees F. : 6, 5, 7 4, 3. That is, an average of 4.6 or 23 per cent, of the children attending school had abnormal temperatures during that week. The normal number found during an ordinary year varies from 3 per cent. to 4 per cent. Observations on temperature during the following week failed, owing to the fall in the school attendance, to get any further reliable information. It is obvious that the abnormal number must have been dependant on mild forms of infection, as the majority of these developed no further symptoms. Hence, if to the 30 per cent. who were seriously ill, 23 we add another 20 per cent, who were attacked and did not know it, it is safe to assume that the proportion of the population that was absolutely immune was very small. The point is of interest because if the number of cases which do not seek medical advice or are themselves unaware of their condition is very large, then any attempt to control infection will be hopeless. Even suppose we advise that congestive areas or rooms should be avoided, that precaution only dilutes the possible infection; it does not militate against it. The effect might be not to reduce the number of cases, but simply to prolong the period of spread. There is no evidence to believe that any particular economic section of the population was attacked, though information on this point is extremely difficult to obtain, owing to the nature of the population at the present time. One point arises with respect to those suffering from Tuberculosis. Out of 130 patients 10 died, and their deaths were returned as dependent on Influenza alone, suggesting that the Phthisis death-rate for the year may be lower than it would otherwise have been. The possible similarity in the epidemiology of Measles and Influenza is of interest, and the following points have been drawn up. The three waves are compared with the prevalence of Measles in 1916, 1917, and 1918. Incubation Period'— Measles 12 days. Influenza 2-4 days. Ratio one to five roughly.

Influenza (age of deaths) 58.50 years 17.0 years 16.0 years Measles (age of attack) 4.42 years 2.68 years 2.11 years Influenza (age of attack) 7.88 years 9.06 years 9.50 years Standard deviation of temporal wave based on deaths. Influenza — 1.236 mos. 1.945 mos. Measles — Standard deviation of epidemic wave, based on attacks. Measles 1.97 mos. 1.40 mos. 1.2 mos. From these facts it would seem that a rough numerical relationship exists, the ratio between the incubation periods being in some way associated with the periodicity. Thus, Measles is periodic over a 2-3 year period, whilst Influenza occurs roughly about every 15-25 years. The point is of interest, but the information available is not sufficient to make any definite statement. As a general conclusion it would seem as if any attempt to hinder the spread of infection is hopeless, and that it is even doubtful whether the development of the the epidemic wave can be delayed. Whatever action is taken, it should be concentrated on the relief of those attacked. The immunisation of the individual through his own powers is the natural manner by which the parasite is slowly overcome. It is common sense to expect that if the disease is ever eradicated from our midst it will be on these lines. In the meantime, those objects which aim at the maintenance of health during non-epidemic periods are more likely to curtail the death-rate than improvisations when the disease is in our midst. The relationship between the ordinary common cold passing on to the condition roughly classed as an influenzal cold and endemic-influenza, as regards the symptoms produced and the 25 similarity in the age periods attacked, lends credence to the view that epidemic influenza is the periodic rise of virulence of the common complaint. A similar sequence occurs in respect to Measles, Scarlet Fever, etc. The aggregation of large numbers of similar ages consequent on the national emergency, may have had something to do with the evolution of this particular type of disease. Hospital Accommodation. Since 1915 the scope of the work done at the Hospital has steadily expanded, though Dr. Fenton in 1907-1908 admitted (18-13) 31 cases of Tuberculosis. In 1909, however, it was discontinued. In 1912 Tuberculosis was again admitted along with 3 cases of Ophthalmia. In 1914 20 cases of Diarrhoea and vomiting (infants) were treated, and from that date the number of cases other than infectious disease has steadily increased. From 1917 onwards the ordinary infectious ailments were less than half the total number of patients admitted. Up to June, 1919, however, the admission of general ailments was mainly during periods of quiescence. From that date onwards a whole unit of the Hospital (14 beds) was allocated to maternity work. This steady expansion in the scope of the work attempted may to some extent weaken the influence of the urgent recommendations made both by the (Local Government Board) Ministry of Health and the various Medical Officers as to the pressing need for further accommodation. The following facts should be carefully borne in mind :— The air space necessary per bed for infectious ailments is 1,872 cubic feet. The Lower Hospital contains 23,000 cubic feet, sufficient for 14 beds. 26 Upper Hospital (at present Maternity) contains 13,000 cubic feet, sufficient for 9 beds. Lower Hospital (at present Diphtheria) contains 18,000 cubic feet, sufficient for 10 beds. On air space measurement for infectious work, the total capacity of the whole Hospital is 33 beds. From the end of September, 1919, to the end of March, 1920, the total daily number of occupied beds has averaged over 50. The Diphtheria Ward has constantly had more than twice as many patients than its air space allows. It is obvious, therefore, that the allocation of 13,000 cubic feet of air space to Maternity was not justifiable, unless the conditions under which births occur are such as obviously threaten life. As to what extent actual working has justified1 this procedure will be referred to later. It is highly desirable that any further buildings should form some part of a comprehensive scheme. To draw up a plan on these lines, some idea of the future population to be served must be formed. The question as to whether the future extensions are or are not under the one civic control does not materially affect the Hospital, as every endeavour should be made to make it serve the whole area. A small institution such as is at present possessed should be avoided for many reasons. The essential facts may be taken as follows :— (1) The future population to be served may be estimated at 250,000. 27 (2) The requirements for the various purposes are as follows :— Per 1,000 Population. Per 1,250 Beds. For Infectious Diseases 1.6 beds 200 ,, Tuberculosis 1.0 „ 125 ,, Maternity .5 „ 63 ,, Ailing Children and Mothers (Diarrhoea, Bronchitis, Pneumonia) .4 „ 50 ,, School Children .3 „ 37 ,, Children 2-5 years .2 „ 25 ,, General acute medical cases, over 14 years 4.0 „ 500' ,, Chronic cases 2.0 „ 250 Totals 10.0 „ 1,250 This gives one bed per 100 population. Assuming, however, that the housing conditions of the district to be served will be better than that on which this estimate is based, it may be safely halved. This would necessitate 325 beds for infectious cases and 925 for other conditions. These institutions should be kept as close together as possible, without undue contact. The recommendations are :— (1) That the present site be retained, but squared off, including the land up to Yanderplank Road. (2) That the low-lying area be fenced off as an open public area, having a road with grass spaces each side. (3) That the southern part between the open space and the railway be used for infectious cases, and medical, surgical, maternity, and children on the present extended as suggested above. 28 (4) The area for infectious ailments should be spaced out into blocks or units of 36 beds indoor and 14 outdoor. One of these units'should be erected at once. (5) The other items needing attention are the Laundry and Kitchen, both of which have now been outgrown by the demands made upon them. The following table gives the work the Hospital has done since its beginning in 1893, with the cost. It is to be noted that the financial and hospital years do not coincide; nine months of present is included in the previous year's work. Taking periods, we have the following figures:— The expenses on maternity work are as follows :— Expenditure— £ s. d. 1,380 maternity days, at 10s. 4d. ... 692 6 0 Income— . Patients' fees 36 4 6 Nett cost £656 1 6 Cost of Hospital per Patient. Average Cost Average Patients. 1896-1899 (first 3 years excluded) 13.8 88.25 1900-1909 10.51 185.4 1910-1919 ,£12.2 192.4 Gross cost of Hospital, April 1st to December 31st, 1919, was £3,885 1 8 Total number of patient days was 7,417 This gives a cost per day of (5s. 6d. pre-war) 10s. 4d. The total number of mother days were 756 days The total number of baby days were 624 days The total number of child welfare days were 610 „ 29 / The total number of patients admitted was 35. It should be noted, however, that during the nine months under consideration several heavy items of expenditure occurred. Thus £792 was spent on redecorating, £595 for furniture and bedding, and £202 for ironmongery and repairs. The nature of the cases admitted is given in the last column of the table, page 15. The excessive prevalence of Diphtheria has been commented on previously. The fall in the number of Tuberculosis cases admitted is consequent on the admission of maternity cases. The first maternity case was admitted in March, and 37 were dealt with by the end of the year. One mother died from Phthisis, and 30 babies were born. No case of infectious disease developed in any of these cases, nor was any variation in temperature noted which might lead to the belief that they were undergoing any undue risk. It is to be noted that in February of the present year a rather suspicious looking throat occurred, which caused some anxiety. Subsequent events, however, showed that the precautions taken were unnecessary. Certain experiments were tried, with the object of warming the bed for open-air treatment. An electrically warmed blanket was purchased, and proved eminently successful, the cost per day at present rates for current being about Is. 2d., though this could be reduced, owing to wastage through resistance to about 11d. Two beds were also fitted with hot water pipes supplied from an independent gas-heated boiler ; the cost per day for gas worked out to about 6d. The cost of warming the Diphtheria Ward is about 4d. per day per occupied bed. In spite of the higher cost, the many advantages in such a method of treatment would justify p further extension. It is hoped to have ten shelters in use where one or other of these methods of warming is adopted. 30 Maternity and Child Welfare. The work conducted during the past year has been amplified in certain respects. An attempt was made to bring all the agencies in the town under the influence of the Council, but the effort failed. The number of midwives practising in the district has increased considerably, partly by fresh additions and partly by appointments made by the Council. The town now possesses one midwife to every 80 births, a figure which is in excess of what is actually required. Estimating the number of births for the current year as 1,000, and allowing 450 of these to the medical men, 650 are left to be divided amongst eight midwives—two at the Hospital, two at the Nurses' Home, one at the Hut, and two in private practice. This gives an average of one to 80 births; a midwife should do 120 births. It is to be borne in mind that with respect to births which occur in institutions, maternal mortality has fallen considerably during the last 50 years. There has, however, been little change in this respect amongst those occurring in the Home. It is fully realised that much of this death-rate depends on causes operative before birth. These causes may or may not be capable of removal in a practical sense, still until information is obtained that the 31 birth is impending no attempt can be made to acquaint the prospective mother with the'facilities that the Council are prepared to place at her disposal. In many instances persuasion is necessary to induce these women to have their babies under decent and sanitary conditions. Notification of pregnancy was tried in 1915, and failed; its repetition cannot be recommended. A scheme was approved during the year for the appointment of an Assistant Medical Officer, the appointment being made in June of the present year. It is hoped that the pre-natal Clinic will be re-established under the guidance of this officer. Work Done by Health Visitors. There were 886 births notified during the year, and 815 regis- . tered. As many as 100 per cent, of the number of births notified received a visit from the Health Visitors. Out of 886 cases, 358 were attended by a general practitioner, and 165 by midwives. 316 received assistance from the local branch of the Plaistow Maternity Charity and 33 at the Municipal Hospital, Upney. The following table gives the figures for the year 1919:— 1914. 1919. Total number registered 977 815 Total number notified 983 886 Attended by Doctors 406 358 Attended by Midwives 577 481 Number visited 857 936 In 144 cases re-visits were necessary, the total number of re-visits being 2,199. This figure includes visits paid to children born in 1918. The reasons why further supervision was required were : 101 first children, 5 twins, 2 poverty, 19 artificial feeding, 32 and 17 other causes. At the time of the first visit out of 886, 848 were entirely breast fed, 19 mixed, 19 artificially fed. At about the third month 174 were entirely breast fed, 54 mxed, and 55 artificially. The following figures give some idea as to the reason of death other than its immediate cause. The last column gives the percentage dying in the first year. Total Numbers.

There can be no doubt that the maintenance of the modern standards of life and the reproduction of a child every two years is rather more than can be borne by the average woman unless some assistance is given in her domestic duties. 33 The amount of dried milk sold during the year was 7, 118½ lbs., costing £699 6s. 9d. Of this, 811 Albs, was given free of charge and 341bs. at half price. Babies' Welcome. Meetings are held from two to five on Tuesday afternoons at the School Clinic. The waiting room is used for general assembly purposes, and the consulting room for weighing and examination of infants. The weighing is performed by the Health Visitor in charge, and simple advice is given to the mothers on clothing, feeding, etc. Any infant whose progress is not satisfactory is examined by the Medical Officer of Health. A cup of tea is provided for each mother. An, additional meeting is held on Thursday afternoons for sewing. During the year the average attendance per week was 45.5; during the warm weather the weekly average was 52. The number of individual mothers who attended during the year was 280. Of these, 47 attended once only, the total number of attendances being 2,181, making an average number of attendances of nine per mother. There are many who come regularly, either weekly or fortnightly, but the number should be Jarger. Regular attendance is most necessary, as far more can be done for such a child than for one who is only brought up when it begins to show signs of wasting. The most regular attendants are those with " first" babies. Speaking generally, the mothers seem to greatly appreciate the opportunity for obtaining advice with regard to feeding, clothing, and so on. Paper patterns of these garments are given to those who wish for them, and many mothers have availed themselves of this opportunity. It is desirable that material at cost price should be supplied as well. 34 Poor Law Administration. The figures are as follows :— 1918. 1919. Out-Relief, £2,375 2s. 8d. Out-Relief, £3,079 3s. Id.
