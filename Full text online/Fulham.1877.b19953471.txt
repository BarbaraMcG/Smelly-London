The Board, during the year ended 25th March, 1378, obtained the sanction of the Metropolitan Board of Works to a loan for permanent works as follows:— loan £4125. London Road Sewer £3500 Stamford Brook Sewer contribution 625 £4125 north end road. The widening and improvement of the road at the entrance to Walham Green has been carried out, and the Metropolitan Board of Works have agreed to contribute a moiety of the cost. The Board has not yet been able to obtain the consent of the leaseholders for the continuation of the improvement northward to Beaufort House. Queen street. The improvement of this street, to be effected by setting back the boundary fence of the churchyard upon the one side, and by the setting back of the houses upon the other side, from a point near to the south end of Queen's Terrace to a point near the Britannia Court, is still under the consideration of a Committee, and it is proposed to include it in a scheme for general street improvements. west kensington station, north end road. In laying out the Estate opposite to this newly-named Station, an opportunity was afforded, by the liberality of the landowners and leaseholders, for effecting a most important improvement, by the setting back of the fence line upon the western side of the Roadway, from a point by the "Anchor 16 in Hope" public house to the Railway Bridge, and the widening of the road and footway there. Arrangements are in course of progress by which it is hoped that a further improvement may be carried out along the line of the adjoining estate, Sir William Palliser having offered to carry out certain improvements. shepherd's bush. The Board has carried out certain improvements at Shepherd's Bush by the alteration and widening into a trumpet mouth of both ends of the road, in front of Lawn Place, and by the formation of good pitched crossings at the intersection of the two main roads, and the construction of a refuge or halting place for pedestrians. general street improvements. The Board, for some time past, has had under consideration the necessity of widening and improving certain thoroughfares in the District, in order to meet and provide for the rapidly growing requirements of the traffic, and has prepared a Schedule as follows:— Class I., embracing those improvements which the Board term "Metropolitan," and propose to ask the Metropolitan Board to undertake. Class II., embracing those alterations and improvements which are considered to be "Local," and which the Board propose to carry out by means of a loan, to be raised on security of the rates. As, however, Parliamentary power will be required in both classes it is feared that some time will yet elapse before the work can be carried out. albert place drainage. A new deep sewer has been constructed in Beavor Lane from the main intercepting sewer on the Mall, and the whole of the house drains have been re-constructed and connected with the new sewer. open spaces.—wormholt scrubbs. The Board is informed that Her Majesty's Government, having purchased the soil of this Common, are about to introduce into Parliament a Bill to vest the said Common in the Metropolitan Board of Works on trust, to enable the same to be used for military purposes, and subject thereto upon trust, 17 for the perpetual use thereof by the inhabitants of the Metropolis for exercise and recreation, and to enable the Metropolitan Board to maintain the same, and to make compensation for till rights injured by the trusts and purposes aforesaid. eel brook common, brook green, parson's green. During the year a preliminary inquiry has been held before one of the Assistant Inclosure Commissioners, with a view to dealing with these Commons under the provisions of "The Metropolitan Commons' Act, 1866," the Metropolitan Board of Works having memorialized the Inclosure Commissioners to hold such inquiry, and to prepare a draft scheme under the powers of the said Act, for preserving these Commons for the use of the public. shepherd's bush. The work of raising the level of the Common has progressed slowly during the year, but already it can be seen how much improved the Common will be when the works are completed, metropolitan district railway extension works. The result of the Board's action in this matter was, that the Company agreed to construct their works so as to interfere as little as possible with the level of the roads, to carry out certain works of paving and pitching, and to pay the sum of £500 in satisfaction of costs incurred by the Board. thames river (prevention of floods) bill. In pursuance of the prayer of their petition to the House of Commons, this Board duly appeared, in conjunction with the representatives of other Riparian Vestries and District Boards, by their agents, counsel, and witnesses before the Select Committee upon this Bill, and after a careful and impartial investigation by the Select Committee, involving, upon the part of this Board, a most arduous and expensive contest with the Metropolitan Board of Works, extending over the twelve days of the inquiry before the Committee. On the fifth day of the inquiry, during the progress of the case of the promoters of the Bill (the Metropolitan Board of Works), the Committee stated "That they did not consider the case of the promoters complete "in respect of evidence as to the incidence of taxation pro"posed by the Bill, and that they would expect the promoters "to produce the plans and estimates promised by them before "the opponents opened their case." b 18 And thereupon the Committee adjourned to the 7th of June, when a series of plans and estimates were produced, among them one for works in the Fulham District, estimated at £6,300. Having received a copy of the plan and estimate, so far as related to the Fulham District, and having carefully considered the estimate and examined the plan, after a detailed inspection of the banks of the River, the Board were, by their counsel, able to show the defectiveness of the Metropolitan Board's scheme, and the utter inadequacy of the estimate to the work required, and this point has received a striking exemplification during the present Session, when the estimate for Fulham is increased from £6,300 to £12,574. At the conclusion of the case for the promoters, the various opponents were heard, and after deliberation the Committee resolved," That the most equitable "mode of charging and meeting the expenses to be incurred "for the prevention of Floods within the Metropolitan District "would be, that the works should be carried into effect by the "Metropolitan Board of Works, and the expenses paid by a "rate levied over the whole Metropolitan area." Upon this resolution complying with and meeting the prayer of this Board's and various other opponents' petitions, the Metropolitan Board of Works stated their intention of withdrawing the Bill. This Board, feeling the, responsibility of the necessity for works of protection being carried out, entered into communication with her Majesty's Government, and by memorials and deputation to the Home Secretary, urged upon the Government to bring in some Bill dealing with the question in the manner approved by the Committee of the House of Commons. The Government has been in communication with the Metropolitan Board upon the subject, but to the surprise and alarm of the Board the Metropolitan Board are now seeking for leave to introduce a Bill into Parliament, whereby they seek to revoke the law and to establish the liability of riverside owners, and, while accepting the decision of the Select Committee so far as compensation is concerned, and proposing to make it a charge upon the Metropolis, the Metropolitan Board rejects that decision as regards the cost incurred in the execution, maintenance, repair and alteration of all defensive works, and the new estimate for works in this District is £12,574. The Board, immediately upon learning the nature of this proposition, put themselves in communication with the various riparian parishes, and has reason to believe that this attempt of 19 the Metropolitan Board to override the decision of the Select Committee, will be totally unsuccessful. the mall (obstructions). An action having been brought against the Board by Mr. William Ayres, he claiming the land in front of East Cottage as a private wharf, the Board deeply regret that they were unsuccessful in their defence, founded upon the assertion of the public right of access to the river at the point in question. A verdict having been given for the plaintiff, the Board has moved the Court for a new trial, and trust that they may be able at a later date to report that they have succeeded in maintaining the right of the public to the use of the piece of land now in dispute. toll bridges. The Metropolitan Board, having obtained the necessary Parliamentary power, it is expected that the three Bridges over the Thames, within the Fulham District, will shortly be declared free from toll. street nomenclature, etc. Westwick Gardens, in the parish, has been re-named, "Westwick Street," and re-numbered. pillar letter boxes. Upon application of the Post-Office authorities, the Board has sanctioned the erection of additional pillar letter-boxes within the District, viz.: one in Latymer Road, and one in Wood lane. victoria road and bullow road. The Board has constructed a sewer to form an outlet for the drainage of this Estate, and has issued notices upon the owners of the property for payment of the cost of the work of sewering the two streets, and it is hoped that the carrying out of this work will materially assist in the improvement of this locality. construction of sewers by private persons. Having regard to the great importance of securing the control over the construction of sewers by land owners and others within the District, so as to ensure that the plans, as sanctioned by the Metropolitan Board, are adhered to, this Board has published a set of rules and regulations for the guidance of landowners, builders, and others. For the general information 20 of tlx; inhabitants a copy of the rules is printed herewith in Appendix No. 7. blomfield road sewer. Early in the course of the year an application was made by Mr. Saunders for permission to construct a 12 inch pipe sewer in continuation of the existing sewer in this road, but the Metropolitan Board refused to sanction anything less than a 3 ft. by 2 ft. brick sewer. Mr. Saunders then drew the attention of the Metropolitan Board to the fact that the sewer in the road had not been constructed by the landowners at the depth and level, as shewn upon the plan sanctioned by the said Board in 1864. After some correspondence the Metropolitan Board called upon this Board to alter and reconstruct the sewer in the manner and at the levels shown upon the plan sanctioned in 1864. A long correspondence ensued, the Board pointing out to the Metropolitan Board that at the time the works were executed, the Clerk of the Works for the said Board authorized the departure from the approved levels in consequence of the great pressure of water rendering it exceedingly dangerous and difficult to carry out the plan, and this Board submitted to the Metropolitan Board two alternative schemes for dealing with the drainage of the road, either of which schemes would have provided a perfectly efficient and sufficient drainage without incurring the heavy cost of taking up and relaying the sewers. The Metropolitan Board, however, insisted upon a strict compliance with the order of 1864, and have commenced proceedings against this Board to enforce their demands. london road sewer. In consequence of the defective condition of this old shallow sewer, the Board, during the year, has constructed a new 3 ft. 6 in. by 2 ft. 9 in. brick sewer in the London Road, from the main intercepting sewer, by the White Hart public house, Walham Green, to Stamford Street, providing an efficient outlet for the sewerage of this line of road and the lateral streets. sale of food and drugs' act. The Board, after correspondence with the Local Government Board, determined to carry into effect the provisions of this Act by the appointment of a public analyst for the District, and on the 6th June last appointed Mr. R. H. Davies as Food Analyst for the District at a salary of £100 per annum, and the appointment was duly ratified and confirmed by the Local 21 Government Board. The Board also appointed the two Inspectors of Nuisances to be Inspectors under this Act A tabular statement is given at the end of this report, shewing the number of articles analysed, etc., in the nine months ended March, 1878. See Appendix No. 5. tramway. The Board report that after protracted negotiation with the proprietors of the Tramway in the Uxbridge Road, arrangements were made by the proprietors for the repairing and pitching the Tramway with granite cubes, so relieving the Board from the necessity of taking legal measures to enforce the carrying out of the work which had long been rendered desirable by reason of the unsafe condition of the Roadway. The work of pitching has lately been completed, and the whole line of road is now in fair condition. sand's end lane. The Gas Light and Coke Company having given notice to the Board as Surveyors of Highways, of the Company's wish to stop up a portion of this lane, and to dedicate to the public in lieu thereof a new road running from the King's Road to the River, the proposal was laid before the Fulham Vestry in due course, but the said Vestry declined to sanction the proposal. fulham bridge, The Board has carried out important works at this place by raising the level of the approach road, the draw-dock landing stage and plying place, and it is hoped and believed that the work performed will materially contribute to the safety and comfort of the inhabitants of Fulham Old Town by preventing the overflow of the River Thames at this point. church row, fulham. The Board has agreed to make certain alterations and improvements here by the kind permission of the Vicar, who consents to the garden wall upon the south side being set back, so as to widen the road leading to the church. salting roads (during frost). At the request of the London General Omnibus Company the Board has consented to allow the Company to sprinkle salt upon the carriage way for the purpose of enabling horses, &c., to obtain foothold during frosty weather. 22 parliamentary notices. During the month of November the usual Parliamentary notices were given, and the plans were lodged for the following schemes referring to this District, viz.:— Fulham and Walham Green Railway. Metropolitan District Railway. Great Western Railway. Fulham Improvements. Metropolis Water Supply. Cromwell Road Bridge. Of these various schemes the Fulham and Walham Green Railway Bill, Fulham Improvements Bill and the Metropolis Water Supply Bill, were withdrawn by the promoters, and the Great Western Bill was only for the acquisition of additional land, at or near Ladbroke Road. With respect to the Metropolitan District Railway—a Bill for the construction of a Railway from West Brompton to Fulham Old Town, with a pier a short distance below the Bridge,—the Board lodged a petition against the Bill to obtain a locus standi before the Committee; but upon certain conditions being agreed to by the promoters and embodied in clauses inserted in the Bill before the Committee, the Board withdrew their opposition, and it is expected that this Bill will shortly become law. cromwell road bridge. A Bill for the construction of a bridge over the network of lines of Railway lying between Addison Road and West Brompton, with approach road from Cromwell Road West, in the parish of Kensington, and from the North End Road, in the parish of Fulham. The Board agreed to certain terms with the promoters and the Kensington Vestry, which are embodied in the Bill, and it is hoped that Parliamentary sanction may shortly be obtained to enable the promoters to carry into effect this scheme, and so provide a new and commodious approach road, connecting South Kensington with the parish of Fulham at a point where large and important building operations are in course of progress. public health. While the general public health has remained good the Board deeply regrets to have to report the continued virulence of small-pox within the District. The Board, in their endeavours to combat the spread of this fearful disease, have spared neither time, trouble, nor money, feeling assured that 23 they will be supported by public opinion in their efforts, although the cost to the District has been so large. It had been the practice of the Board to burn all infected bedding, &c., that had been in use by patients suffering from small-pox and other infectious diseases, but, owing to the difficulties often experienced in cases where it has been found impossible to burn the articles in the yard or. garden attached to the premises, by reason or the near contiguity of the surrounding houses, and having in view the danger incurred by the public when the goods were conveyed through the public streets to some suitable place for destruction, the Board, after inquiries and inspection of the various apparatus in use at hospitals, workhouses, &c., determined upon having erected at the stone wharf, "Chancellors," a disinfecting chamber, of a similar character to one they had seen in operation at Woolwich, and this work has been carried out by Messrs. Rosser and Russell, of Queen's Wharf, Hammersmith, who have also supplied for use, with the apparatus, an iron vehicle for the conveyance to and from the Chamber of the bedding, &c. This vehicle is itself run into the Chamber with its load of bedding, and the sides being opened, is there left, so that the vehicle, as well as the goods, is disinfected with each load. One of the most important difficulties of the Board, in dealing with an outbreak of infectious diseases, is the difficulty that exists of obtaining early information of individual cases, and the Board has memorialized the Home Secretary upon the subject, suggesting that Her Majesty's Government should obtain legislative power, making it compulsory upon medical practitioners and others to give notice to the Local authorities of the outbreak of every case, so as to enable the Local authorities to order the necessary precautions to be taken for the proper isolation of each patient. prosecution of west. In connection with the subject of small-pox, the Board report that it became their painful duty to prosecute a tradesman (Thomas West), who had been entrusted with orders to supply to persons whose goods had been burnt, certain articles to replace those destroyed. From the evidence given at his trial it was proved that West had been systematically charging the Board for goods which had not been delivered, and he was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment. One of the Board's officers (Clarence W. Keall), late Inspector of Nuisances for the Parish of Fulham, it is presumed 24 was in league with West to defraud the Board. Keall has absconded, and the Board has offered a reward of £50 for his apprehension. actions against the surveyor and the clerk. In carrying into effect the arrangements referred to in the last annual Report (page 22), the Board made certain payments to the Surveyor and to the Clerk in respect of work done to the 25th of March, 1877. Subsequently an action was brought against each of those officers for receiving the said payments. The Board instructed their Solicitors to defend the two actions, which were dismissed with costs against the complainant. roadmaking, cartage, etc. The Board has purchased for use in the District for the purpose of the better and more economical repair and formation of the carriageways a ten ton steam roller, which has been in use for some time past with marked success.

GENTLEMEN, In presenting to you My Annual Report for the year 1877, I beg to state, that it is the first that I have had the privilege to lay before you. I have to thank you for the honour you have conferred upon me in appointing me to the distinguished post of Medical Officer of Health to this important district, and I hope and trust that my services will prove satisfactory to your Board, and beneficial to the inhabitants whom you represent. POPULATION . The first subject that I beg to bring before your notice, is the question of population. From calculations that I have made upon the number of the inhabitants in the district, at the different times the census has been taken during the last 27 years, I am able to inform you with almost absolute certainty (in the absence of the census being taken), that we have a population of about 96,000 inhabitants ; about 58,000 in the parish of Hammersmith, and about 38,000 in the parish of Fulham. My calculation is based upon the number of births, these having continued in the same proportion, without any material variation, at the different times that the census has been taken, giving a ratio of 35.5 births per annum to 1,000 inhabitants. MORTALITY. The number of deaths registered during the year, was 1,765, against 1,963 in the previous year. The average number of deaths in the three previous years being 1,839. This diminution in the death-rate is remarkable, when we take into consideration the epidemic of small-pox which has visited us. 46 Of the 1,765 deaths occurring during the past year, 121 were registered in the sub-district of St.Peter's; 814 in the sub-district of St. Paul's; and 830 in the parish of Fulham. The average number of deaths in the three sub-districts during the three years previous being, St. Peter's 132; St. Paul's 976; and Fulham 731. There was, therefore, as compared with the three years previous, notwithstanding the increase of population, a decrease of 11 deaths in the sub-district of St. Peter's; 162 deaths in the sub-district of St. Paul's; but an increase of 99 deaths in the parish of Fulham. This increase of mortality in Fulham parish is mainly due to the small-pox epidemic, from which 63 deaths were registered, and to the number of deaths occurring in the Fulham Small-pox Hospital, which were 49 of the 63 registered in the parish. The greater number of these cases were removed from other parishes to Fulham, for the purpose of isolation. Of the 1,765 deaths occurring during the past year, 481 were those of infants, under one year of age, and 397 were those of persons aged 60 years and upwards. Of the 481 deaths occurring in infants, under one year of age, 34 occurred in the sub-district of St. Peter's, 218 in the sub-district of St. Paul's, and 229 in the parish of Fulham. Of the 397 occurring in persons aged 60 years and upwards, 38 occurred in the sub-district of St. Peter's; 108 in the sub-district of St. Paul's; and 179 in the parish of Fulham. The mortality, therefore, in children under one year of age, is proportionally greater in Fulham than in Hammersmith, though the mortality in Fulham is favourable when compared with other districts in the metropolis. It is on the infantile mortality that we are able to judge in a great measure as to the condition of a district. The mortality in children one year of age and under was 14.973 per cent. in the sub-district of St. Peter's; 11.912 per cent. in the sub-district of St. Paul's; and 17.588 per cent. in the parish of Fulham. Nearly 4 per cent. more children died under one year of age, in Fulham, than in Hammersmith. This difference in the infantile mortality is sufficient to call forth rigid enquiries for the cause or causes acting to produce it. BIRTHS. The number of births registered in the Fulham district during the past year was remarkably large, being 3,409 against 3,315 which occurred in the previous year. It is worth notice that while the number of deaths in the district decreased 47 198 as compared with the previous year, notwithstanding; the increase of population, and the presence of an epidemic of small-pox, the number of births increased 92, the excess of births over deaths, being 1,643, nearly double the number. Of the 3,409 births registered last year, 227 were in St. Peter's, 1,830 in St. Paul's; and 1,352 in the parish of Fulham. CAUSES OF DEATH. Of the eight so-called zymotic diseases, 213 deaths were registered; 9 in the sub-district of St. Peter's; 94 in the subdistrict of St. Paul's; and 110 in the parish of Fulham, 72 deaths occurred from small-pox, 14 from measles, 43 from scarlet-fever, 5 from diphtheria, 44 from whooping cough, 15 from fever, 57 from diarrhoea, and 2 from English cholera. Of the 72 deaths from small-pox, two occurred in the sub-district of St. Peter's, 7 in the sub-district of St. Paul's, and 63 in the parish of Fulham, of which number 49 occurred in the Smallpox Hospital, the patients having been brought there nearly all from other districts, and 14 occurred at the homes of the patients in the parish; 55 deaths occurred from violence; 113 inquests were held; 167 deaths occurred in public institutions. SMALL-POX EPIDEMIC. At the end of the year 1876, small-pox again visited London, from which disease it had been almost free since 1871. The Fulham district also felt the effects of the visitation, the disease continuing in some part of the district during nearly all the year. Owing to the measures adopted by your Board, the number of cases occurring in the district has been small as compared with other districts, and it is most satisfactory to be able to state that in almost every instance in which a case was reported, the course adopted was so far successful as to prevent any further spread of the disease in the same house. On the other hand, your Board have had before you on very many occasions the lamentable results where cases were not reported. I may mention, as one example out of many, the first case at Rectory Place, Parson's Green, Fulham, which was the means of producing 14 fresh attacks, and four deaths in the same row of cottages, though from none of the 14 did the disease spread after they were reported to your officers. During the year 1877, 328 cases of small-pox, occurred in the Fulham district; 119 in the parish of Hammersmith and 209 in the parish of Fulham; 196 cases were removed to hospitals; 132 cases 48 were not removed. Of the 196 cases removed to hospitals ,74 were taken by the Union Authorities, and 122 by your Board, 112 to Highgate, and 10 to the Fulham Small-pox Hospitals. Of the 119 cases occurring in the parish of Hammersmith. 100 were isolated at hospitals. Of the 209 cases occurring in the parish of Fulham, 96 cases were removed. 84.0 per cent. therefore, of the cases occurring in Hammersmith, were removed to hospitals, and 45.9 per cent. of those occurring in Fulham. This difference in the per centage of cases properly isolated is sufficient to account for the great difference in the number of cases occurring in the two parishes. Of the 112 patients removed to Highgate, 21 died, and 9 out of the 19 treated at home in the parish of Hammersmith. 18.7 per cent. therefore, of the patients removed to Highgate died, and 47.3 of those treated at home in Hammersmith. The most energetic efforts were made to get cases removed to hospitals, but unfortunately a large proportion of patients remained to spread the disease without proper accommodation, or means of isolation. Some of the medical men in the district and nearly all of those in Hammersmith, did all in their power to assist us in the removal of cases. I wish particularly to mention Dr. Daniell, who spared no trouble to assist us in stopping the spread of the disease, I do not know of a single instance in that gentleman's practice, where the case was not at once reported, immediately removed, and as a consequence the disease at once stamped out in the house. I do not think that I am saving a word too much when I state, that if all the medical men in the district had adopted the same course, 90 per centl of the cases would have been prevented. Unfortunately there was a very different course adopted by s6me, though I am very glad to say few. I found numerous cases treated with the worst possible accommodation. One case in particular, which occurred at North End, Fulham, where I found a patient who was being treated upon a sofa in a parlor through which the people of the house passed into the kitchen very many times a day. In another case, at North End, Fulham, I felt it my duty to dispute the question of accommodation, and appealed to the learned magistrate, who was of the same opinion as myself, that all such cases ought to be removed to hospitals, and granted us all the power the law affords. I am glad to say that since he expressed his opinion in public the opposition with which we had been met has very considerably diminished. The difficulties that we have to contend against 49 are innumerable. The law as it now stands is undoubtedly most defective as regards the isolation of persons suffering from infectious diseases. In the first place it should be a legal requirement of every one having charge, either professionally, or otherwise, of any sick person suffering from any infectious disease, that he should within a given time report the same to the Sanitary authorities. In the second place, the Sanitary authorities should be endowed with legal power to remove every case so as to ensure complete isolation. This would be really no new idea, for we read that in the Sanitary law of Moses, every person suffering from any unclean disease was immediately isolated without the camp. Nothing short of going back to that old Sanitary law can have any effect to absolutely prevent the spread of infectious disease. There can be no earthly doubt to any reasonable mind that vaccination is an absolute preventive to the poison of small-pox, and if vaccination was only sufficiently carried out, small-pox would no longer exist; but on the other hand, there can be no doubt that a great many people are not sufficiently protected by vaccination, and as a consequence they will take small-pox when exposed to its influence. In a small per centage of cases there can be no doubt that the constitutions of children are destroyed through impure vaccine. The great question to my mind is whether vaccination would be necessary if persons suffering from small-pox were properly and immediately isolated. I am rather of opinion that it would not. It appears to me that it would be less an inter, ference with individual right to isolate a person against his wish, when suffering from an infectious disease, than it is to introduce a poison into his blood when he is in a state of health. The question of disinfectants is one that requires some few words. There can be no doubt that the theory upon which thev are used, is a very sound one; but the manner of using them is quite absurd. The public, as a rule, look upon a disinfectant in a mysterious sort of way, believing that it possesses some wonderful power of protection against disease. One is met with the reply that there is no danger because a small quantity of some so-called disinfectant is sprinkled on the floor. All fear is often removed thereby, and as a consquence the best disinfectants, an abundant supply of fresh air and complete isolation, are neglected. All that the science of hygiene can accomplish comes far short of what was done by that ancient law, which if adopted in the present day would no doubt be the means of preventing this large sacrifice of human life, to say nothing of the enormous expense incurred by the palliative means now adopted. 50 SCARLET FEVER Of the 43 deaths resulting from scarlet fever, 20 occurred in the sub-district of St. Paul's, and 23 in the parish of Fulham. My remarks as to the necessary isolation for the prevention of small.pox will equally apply to this disease. Very ineffectual measures are, as a rule, adopted to prevent the spread of the poison. It is quite an exception for us to obtain information of a case except through the death returns. FULHAM SMALL-POX HOSPITAL. Several cases of small-pox have occurred in the immediate neighbourhood of the Fulham small-pox Hospital. The question that has arisen is whether the disease has been propagated from that institution. From all the enquiries that I have made, I have been unable to obtain the slightest evidence which would lead me to suppose that such was the case. I am of opinion that although a more isolated situation would have been desirable, in the absence of any evidence that the disease has spread, there is no need for the slightest anxiety. PIGGERIES. Many thousands of swine are kept in the District, and numerous reports have been brought before your Board on the subject. It is beyond question that the Fulham district is not a fit or proper place for the keeping of swine. The population has now become so large that the air is required in as pure a state as possible to ventilate human dwellings. Most of the piggeries are without doubt a nuisance and injurious to health. Your Board have already commenced steps for the abolition of this evil. I trust that the course adopted will be beneficial to the District. METEOROLOGY. The low rate of mortality during the past year has been mainly dependent upon the temperature of the first and last three months, at which periods the greatest number of deaths usually occur. The weather during the first quarter was remarkable for an excessive rain fall, and comparative high temperature, though there was very little sunshine throughout that period. 4.35 inches of water fell in the month of 51 January, being the largest amount since the year 1815. This excessive fall of rain was the cause of serious floods almost everywhere. In December the readings of the barometer were alternately above and below the averages. The highest readings in the year being 30.507 inches on December 20th. The lowest reading in the year was 28.64 inches on November 11th. The mean temperature of the air for the year was 49.4.
