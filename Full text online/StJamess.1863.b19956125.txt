General Report of Works EXECUTED BY THE VESTRY OF ST. JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER, IN THE YEAR 1863-64. b 11 To the Chairman and Vestry of St. James's, Westminster. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, 23rd June, 1864. Reverend Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, As directed at this period of the year I present yon with a short summary of the principal Works that have been executed during the twelve months ending 25th March, 1864, in connection with the department to which I have the honour to belong. None of them, as will be seen, are very formidable; the chief object of the Works Committee, under whose instructions they have been carried out, having been, as far as possible, to curtail and reduce expenditure of any kind, so that all the various matters referred to in the lists annexed have been considered as actually necessary. It should be borne in mind that, as a general principle, a great deal more time and consideration is required to do a little judiciously, than to do a great deal indiscriminately; and although the 12 amounts expended do not seem large full value has been obtained by the Parish for them. The list of Paving Works is reduced to a minimum, only one special work being reported; but the time of the few men employed by the Parish has been fully accounted for in the maintenance of the various roads and footways. It will be seen from the annexed list and my fortnightly reports, that no small responsibility is incurred with regard to the various openings made by the gas and water companies, which always require immediate and constant attention. The same thing occurs in connection with all openings made from any cause by private individuals. These matters, combined with the constant watchfulness required, to prevent the carriage and footways generally from becoming in too bad a condition to repair, and the general repair of the whole of the Macadam roads, account in the main for the time of the workmen employed, and to a great extent for my own time, for it is of course much less trouble to a surveyor to order a contractor to re-lay a whole street, which is the most obvious and usual course than for himself personally, with two or three men, to watch and maintain the same in a sound condition, or at any rate a safe one. Sooner or later much larger outlays than this year's account shews, will be necessary, but I have to congratulate the Vestry that on this occasion the actual expenditure in the various Paving Works 13 provided for by the annual estimate, has been considerably below the computed amount. The Sewers department has not involved any very special works. We have constructed no actually new sewers; the bulk of the work done has been in cleansing and repairing gullies and drains, including of course preliminary examinations. In this branch of the Vestry's work, as in in the Paving Works, no unnecessary expense has been incurred, or anything done that was not imperative. Much has been done in the way of cleansing sewers which is in fact the Flusher's usual work, the cost of which is included in their wages. Of course a great deal of my own time has been occupied in various investigations and examinations, to be able to report and advise upon such works as might from time to time be considered necessary. I trust that the item of £.42 17s. 2d. for work in Argyll Place will be refunded to the Vestry, as it represents a sum necessarily expended in investigating and preparing the defence to an action brought by Messrs. Gordon against the Vestry for alleged damage to wine vaults below the carriageway in Argyll Place, Regent Street,—the facts of which are too well known to require recapitulation. The amounts expended in connecting private drains have been refunded. The subject of Urinals has received a great amount of consideration and attention both from the Works Committee and myself; but with 14 the exception of slight repairs and clearing drains where stopped, the only result has been the removal of one urinal from the corner of Bridle Lane, next Brewer Street. A praiseworthy attempt to erect one of superior construction in Cork Mews unfortunately proved abortive. The only course apparently open to the Vestry at present is either to sink them below the surface of the ground, or to rent or hire premises for the purpose of constructing these most necessary conveniences. I have in previous Reports urged upon the Vestry the urgent necessity of giving this subject full consideration, and therefore need not needlessly occupy time or space in again recurring to it, trusting that all the members feel the responsibility that rests upon them, and the great powers that are vested in them by the Legislature to meet that responsibility. With regard to the various other matters connected with the Surveyor's department very little, if any, explanation is required; suffice it to say that all that has been necessary to be done has been done; such matters as involved expenditure have received the attention and sanction of the Works Committee, and are mentioned in the annexed lists. A great portion of the duties of the Surveyor's department cannot be detailed here without occupying a greater amount of space than the Vestry might think it wise to publish. They are all necessary though not interesting; and I wish to call the attention of the Vestry to the fact 15 that these duties, in connection with the Surveyor's department have considerably increased during the last few years, and are even now rapidly enlarging. This fact cannot be ignored and should not be; the increase of traffic during the last ten years has been very great and still continues, thereby gradually but surely rendering the execution of all Paving Works, or works executed in busy thoroughfares, more and more difficult and costly. It will be found upon inquiry that the increase of labour is extending through every branch of the Surveyor's department, and as it is all legally responsible work, the consequences are, or may be, very serious. The Vestry cannot do otherwise than recognise the fact, and give it that attention which it deserves. Their responsibility does not merely consist in actually keeping the paved surfaces safe and free from obstruction, though that involves a great deal, but recent circumstances have shewn how much depends upon the promptitude and ability with which any difficulty is dealt with as it arises; and I take it to be the chief duty of an Officer of a Vestry as far as possible, to settle any matter of business that may occur, as far as lies in the power of his office, without troubling the Vestry unnecessarily, and such has been the chief aim of your Surveyor during the time he has acted as such; the attempt to publish a printed list of every days work for twelve months in his department would in 16 all probability not receive the sanction of the Vestry, as it would fill a moderate volume, nor would any corresponding advantage be answered thereby. With sincere thanks for the re-appointment to my office, the indulgence constantly shewn, and the confidence that has been placed in the endeavours to conduct the business of my department in a satisfactory manner, I remain, Rev. Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, A. P. HOWELL. 17 GENERAL WORKS, &c. executed by The Vestry of St. James's, Westminster, from 25th March, 1863, to 25th March, 1864.

A 23 TO THE VESTRY of The Parish of St. Jame's, Westminster. —♦— Reverend Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you for the Eighth time a series of Tables illustrating the condition of the health of your Parish, with remarks upon the work that has been done for the prevention of the spread of disease and death in the year 1863. THE CENSUS OF 1861. Before entering more particularly into this department of my labours, I wish to call your attention to some of the results of the Census of England and Wales for 1861, as far as it relates to the Parish of St. James's, Westminster. In my report for the year 1861, I was enabled, through the courtesy of the Registrar-General, to give you an account of the general results of the Census, as far as they related to the increase or decrease of the population, and the number of houses and families in the Parish, and the number of inhabitants in each division of the Parish. On the present occasion I shall be able to refer to the value of the property of the Parish, to the ages of 24 the people, their civil condition, occupation, and birth places. VALUE OF PROPERTY. In a table in which the annual value of property assessed in the several parishes within the district of the Metropolitan Board of Works is given, and which is founded on data supplied by that Board, I find the following statements of the value of the rateable property in your Parish and adjoining parishes:— Houses. Population. Annual Value of Property. St. James's, Westminster, 3,333 35,326 £. 431,500 St. George's, Hanover Square 10,437 87,771 943,696 City of London, 13,218 111,784 1300,156 St. Marylebone, 16,357 161,650 976,820 St. Pancras, 21,852 198,788 800,640 Paddington, 9,687 75,784 526,420 Thus it will be seen that whilst the rateable property represents £.12 per head per annum of the population in St. James's, Westminster, it is £.11 in St. George's, Hanover Square, the same in the City of London; £.7 in Paddington, ,£.G in Marylebone, and £4 in St. Pancras. It is very evident from this statement that for all purposes of public improvement and the means of advancing the physical comfort and happiness of its inhabitants, that the Parish of St. James's, Westminster, is in a better position than any parish in the Metropolis. 25 AGES OF THE PEOPLE. The relative ages of people living in various parts of England and Wales vary very much according to circumstances. The following is a summary of the ages of persons in the three districts of this parish:— Berwick Street. St. James's Sq. Golden Square. Males. Females. Males. Females. Males. Females. Under 5 years, 700 713 341 335 723 755 Over 5 & under 10, 592 584 282 305 528 620 „ 10 „ 15, 534 473 275 334 488 531 „ 15 „ 20, 486 479 501 739 606 746 „ 20 „ 25, 460 503 672 956 718 924 „ 25 „ 30, 459 518 598 725 677 870 „ 30 „ 35, 432 481 488 542 523 658 „ 35 „ 40, 367 395 425 403 467 541 „ 40 „ 45, 354 350 404 359 431 469 „ 45 „ 50, 264 285 321 276 353 382 „ 50 „ 55, 204 226 266 232 258 312 „ 55 „ 60, 125 140 187 167 196 218 „ 60 „ 65, 109 126 152 141 167 222 „ 65 „ 70, 54 65 81 61 95 128 „ 70 „ 75, 30 46 64 59 85 121 „ 75 „ 80, 16 20 21 23 35 55 „ 80 „ 85, 6 8 9 3 13 35 „ 85 „ 90, 1 1 5 1 6 7 „ 90 „ 95, .. 1 .. .. 1 2 5193 5414 5092 5661 6370 7596 10,607 10,753 13,966 It will at a glance be seen how different is the number of persons at particular ages in the three districts. Whilst the population is nearly the same there are more than twice the number of children under ten years of age in the Berwick Street and Golden Square districts than there are in the St. James's Square district. 26 CIVIL CONDITION OF THE INHABITANTS. The following table gives the proportion of married and unmarried of males and females, of persons aged fifteen years and upwards, in the Parish of St. James's, Westminster:— Total. 15— 20— 25— 35— 45— 55— 65— 75 and upws. Unmarried, M. 5860 1584 1609 1512 586 309 164 79 17 F. 6754 1914 1884 1751 594 341 159 86 25 Married, .. H. 5687 9 237 1626 1743 1215 623 197 37 W. 5638 49 485 1904 1631 979 472 103 15 Widowed, Wr. 645 .. 4 39 119 142 149 133 59 Wid. 1629 1 14 139 292 393 383 291 116 From this table it will be seen that the proportion of females above fifteen exceeds the number of males by the large number of 1887, or nearly onethirteenth of the whole population. Of this number 954 are single women, 49 are married women, and 984 are widows. OCCUPATION OF MALES AGED TWENTY YEARS AND UPWARDS. In estimating the causes of disease and death in any particular district, it is a matter of importance to know accurately the occupation of the inhabitants, as it is by this means alone that the influence of occupation, independent of other causes, can be estimated. I have therefore thought it would be of considerable interest to extract from the Census of 1861 that part which relates to the occupations 27 of the inhabitants of the Parish of St. James's, Westminster. The following is a Table of the classes and orders according to which the occupations of the people have been classified by the Registrar-General:— CLASSES. Order. ORDERS. Professional Class. I. Persons engaged in the General or Local Government of the Country. II. Persons engaged in the Defence of the Country. III. Persons engaged in the Learned Professions or engaged in Literature, Art, and Science (with their immediate Subordinates). Domestic Class. IV Persons engaged in the Domestic Offices or Duties of Wives, Mothers, Mistresses of Families, Children, Relatives (not otherwise returned). V Persons engaged in entertaining and performing Personal Offices for Man. Commercial Class. Persons who buy or sell, keep, or lend Money, Houses or Goods of various kinds. VII. Persons engaged in the Conveyance of Men, Animals, Goods, and Messages. Agricultural Class. VIII.

A glance at them will supply certain broad features, 34 ing the population of this Parish from many others. Of the 12,000 women above twenty years of age, nearly 5000 have no occupation, 3800 being wives, and another 1000 being dependent on others for their support. On the other hand the male population seems very actively engaged, as we have only 240 persons returning themselves as unemployed or dependent on others. The wealth of the population is at once seen by the fact that more than a ninth of the whole population is employed in domestic service. This includes 3000 maid servants and 1200 men servants. Amongst the men are 1730 tailors, and amongst the women 485 engaged in the same occupation, making altogether a population of 2265; thus indicating that a fifteenth of the whole population is engaged in this business. Of the boot and shoemakers, 763 are men and 450 are women. Amongst the women there are 766 milliners and dressmakers, 310 shirtmakers, and 340 laundresses. It will be seen from these facts how large a portion of the inhabitants of St. James's, Westminster, are engaged in sedentary or indoor occupations. This, perhaps, will throw some light on the statement I made last year, that in proportion to its population our Parish suffered more from consumption than any other in London. This disease is mainly produced by want of fresh air, and is especially engendered in overcrowded dwellings and ill-ventilated shops and work-rooms. 35 BIRTH PLACES OP THE INHABITANTS OP ST.

In the first place it shews that not half the inhabitants of St. James's Westminster, were born in London at all, and probably only a small proportion of them were born in St. James's. This does not arise from increase of population, as St. James's in this respect has rather decreased than increased within the last thirty years. The number of persons under twenty who have been born in London is much greater than those over twenty, shewing the tendency to removal after that age. In the same way it will be seen that the number of persons who come into the Parish to live is much greater after twenty than before twenty years of age. Another curious fact presented by this table is the much larger number of women than of men who have been imported into the Parish. This probably arises from the large demand for domestics, of whom there are 3000. The large number of 1584 persons are found in the Parish, who are foreigners, and not British subjects. Of these 1066 are males, and 518 are females. The following table shews in what part of the world these persons were born. B 38 BIRTH-PLACES OF FOREIGNERS IN ST. JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER. WHERE BORN.

Having dwelt so largely upon the general character of our population in the preceding part of this Report, I only propose to make a few remarks on the tables of mortality which are appended. From these tables you will see that the deaths of the past year are 757. This number is slightly above the average of the last seven years, and is above the mortality of 1862, and is nearly the same as that of 1861. On looking over the tables for the purpose of ascertaining whether any particular form of disease has been more than usually destructive of life, we find no evidence that any of the more controllable forms of disease have been more than usually active. Consumption of all the definite forms of disease takes the lead, and gives us 107 deaths. This however is not so large a number as died in 1862 of this disease. Turning to the group of Zymotic diseases they do not appear, with the exception of small-pox, to have been unusually fatal. The following table will shew you their fatality during the year. Diarrhoea. Hooping Cough. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Small Pox. Typhus. Total. 1st Quarter 2 15 8 7 3 .. 35 2nd Quarter 4 1 13 8 3 2 31 3rd Quarter 14 5 3 8 15 3 48 4th Quarter .. 1 • • 8 • • 3 12 20 22 24 31 21 8 126 40 Although for the whole group of these diseases the mortality is higher than the average, which was 95 for the last nine years, yet it is not so high as the mortality of the year 1862. The table however presents us with this peculiarity, that although all the other forms of Zymotic disease are below, small-pox is very much above the average. The deaths from small-pox during the nine years preceding 1863, were only eighteen, whilst in this one year they were twenty-one. This was only a part of a great epidemic of small-pox which spread throughout London, and even now has not subsided in the provinces. Although but one case of death from small-pox occurred in 1862, I felt that our Parish as well as the rest of London was unprepared to meet an outbreak of this disease, and I have been very urgent that means should be taken to secure the only protection which we know against this disease, and that is Vaccination. The Government has from time to time legislated on the subject of vaccination, but we have still to look for the legislative enactments that shall secure the due vaccination of all children born in this country. Amongst the causes which operate against securing the due performance of the operation of vaccination, I would mention the following:— 1. The carelessness and want of foresight of a large number of the population, who seldom think of providing against the evils 41 of a future day, and when small-pox is not prevailing never think of having their children vaccinated. 2. The prejudices of a few who believe that vaccination is injurious, and who utterly ignoring the proofs of the enormous benefits conferred on the community by this practice, refuse to have their children vaccinated. 3. The insufficient payment of public vaccinators under the Poor Law Act. The fee usually paid to these gentlemen is so low that it acts as no inducement for them to seek out children who are not vaccinated, and they only vaccinate those who are brought to them. 4. The want of a properly constituted medical officer to see that the provisions of the Vaccination Extension Act are properly carried out. In our own as well as other parishes great irregularities are permitted, in the carrying out of this Act, especially in the issue and return of the certificates of vaccination. 5. The necessity of a compulsory registration for births. Many children are born who are not registered, and it is impossible to give the due notice of the necessity of vaccination under such circumstances. 6. A general aversion on the part of the British public to legislation in a matter which they believe to be an interference with their 42 rights. This feeling, which is so fatal to all combined action for the civilisation and welfare of mankind, which demand that individual natural rights should be given up for the public good, not only exists amongst the lowest classes of our population, but amongst the wealthy, is one of the great barriers to the carrying out of vaccination and other sanitary measures. In February 1862, I recommended the adoption of a plan for securing the vaccination of the children of the Parish, by supplying the Sanitary Inspector with a list of all the children born, so that he might by personal visits and inspection ascertain if the provisions of the Vaccination Extension Act had been acted on. He commenced these new duties on the 6th of November, 1862, and in his report in the Appendix, you will see the result of his labours. From that report you will see that he discovered seventeen children unvaccinated. I would make one or two remarks on these returns. In the first place twenty-six persons had given wrong addresses to the Registrar, 122 children had not been supplied with certificates of vaccination although this is required by law, 27 families had removed from the Parish and had left their addresses, 46 families had removed and could not be found. In two instances only the parents refused to satisfy the inquiries of the Inspector. From this you will see 43 how necessary it is to adopt some general system of inspection. For we may conclude that as 73 children have been removed with their families into other parishes, so 73 other children of whose birth we have no registration, have been removed into this. It is only by a systematic supervision of the whole country, that we can expect to extirpate small-pox by means of vaccination. It is too much to expect that under the present circumstances any of the populations of the London parishes will be so completely vaccinated as to prevent future epidemics of small-pox. Of all diseases this is the most contagious and the most certain to attack the unprotected. Hence the importance of removing those who are attacked, from the families and neighbourhoods in which they reside, to some isolated spot. Although there is a small-pox Hospital in London, it has been found during an epidemic that it is quite incapable of holding all who seek admittance. Either each parish should have a place where they may send their small-pox cases, or the parishes of London should combine and make the Small-pox Hospital sufficiently large to meet all demands. This subject was felt to be so important, by the medical officers of health, that on the 25th of April, 1863, they issued a circular to all the Vestries of the Metropolis, urging upon them to provide hospital accommodation, for the purpose of permitting an immediate separation of the diseased from the healthy. 44 The next disease which claims attention is Typhus fever. Although only nine cases of death occurred in the year 1868, there were undoubted indications of a tendency in this disease to spread in the Metropolis, at the end of the year 1868. The admissions into the London Fever Hospital which were 66 in August, rose to 97 in September, and to 235 in October. On November 26, 1868, I read a communication from the Association of Medical Officers of Health, in which they recommended, with a view as far as possible to arrest the epidemic, the following principles:— 1. That in no house should a typhus patient be retained in the house where the disease originated. 2. That adequate provision should at once be made for the reception of typhus fever cases. 3. That the overcrowding of small tenements should as far as possible be prevented. 4. That as the connection between typhus, and privation was well established, liberal relief should be granted to the poor in respect of fire, food, and clothing. These principles have I believe been acted on as far as possible in this Parish, and up to the present time typhus has not assumed an alarming aspect amongst your fellow parishioners. 45 One of the greatest difficulties I have to contend with is the tendency to overcrowding in some parts of the Parish. It is not so much that persons do not remove when notice is served, but that from the constant changes of residence occurring amongst the poor, it is almost impossible to supervise the number of inhabitants contained in each room. That typhus is not more prevalent in our population depends upon the fact, that, although overcrowded, they are not under-fed. I have not any means of ascertaining the average wages of the working people of this Parish, but on turning to the Census of Occupations it will be seen that only 152 persons returned themselves as labourers, thus shewing that the great mass of the employed are skilled artisans who earn high wages. It is only upon the supposition that our poor are well fed and clothed that we can explain their security from typhus fever. In many districts of the Metropolis where the population is much thinner the proportion of typhus is much greater. I present you with the results of an investigation into this subject by Mr. Orton, Medical Officer for the Limehouse District. Deaths from Typhus in 1862. St. James's, Westminster, 13 or 17 in 1000 deaths. St. Marylebone, 104 „ 27 ,, 1000 „ Limehouse District, 115 „ 77 „ 1000 „ 46 We may very properly congratulate ourselves on having kept at bay so dreadful a disease as typhus, and Mr. Orton holds us up as a pattern parish in this respect. But the picture of death has another side for us, and whilst the Medical Officer for Limehouse speaks of our comparative freedom from fever, he points to our terrible mortality from consumption.

St. Marylebone, 894 ,, 104 „ 1000 „ Limehouse, 134 „ 90 „ 1000 „ The practical value of our returns of disease is seen in such facts as these. Whilst Limehouse must be active in preventing the causes of typhus, it behoves us to be alive to the much more insidious causes of consumption, which makes our Parish the grave of the young and hopeful. WORK-ROOMS. The following extract from my report laid before Vestry on the 25th June, will bring to your remembrance a subject which excited at the time very general interest, and which I hope has drawn the attention of the proprietors of large establishments in this Parish to the necessity of ameliorating, as 47 far as is in their power, the condition of a large number of young persons in this Parish. "In consequence of the report in the news"papers of an inquest that had been held upon the "body of a young woman who was found dead "upon the premises of Madame Elise, court dress "maker, of 170, Regent Street, I felt it my duty "to visit the premises, and went last Monday "morning, and the proprietor of the establishment "gave every facility for inspecting the whole of the "premises. They consist of not only the house in "Regent Street, but of the houses Nos. 62 and 63, "King Street. I visited these premises quite un"expectedly, and went into the kitchen, the dining "room, the work rooms, and several of the bed "rooms, in some of which the young women were "dressing, therefore I did not enter them, although "the proprietor wished me to wait and do so. The "whole of the rooms were in good order. In all "the bed rooms measures were made for ventilation "by the sashes of the windows coming down from "the top. There were single bedded, double "bedded, and three bedded rooms; two young "women slept in each bed. I visited especially "the bed room in which the young woman died. "It was a room, which, according to the measure"ments of the Sanitary Inspector, contained 1360 "cubic feet of air. It was a double bedded room, "and four young people slept in it, thus giving "340 cubic feet of air to each individual. There 48 "were two windows in the room which could be let "down by sashes, so as to secure the ventilation of "the room. I visited the work rooms and found "60 young women working in two rooms, which "I found afterwards contained 8000 cubic feet of "air, which gives 130 cubic feet to each indi"vidual*. * In the original report, through the error of a clerk in copying the measurements of the Sanitary Inspector, the cubical space afforded in these rooms was placed at much too low a figure. I immediately forwarded the following letter to The Times and other Daily Papers, who had taken up the case of the young milliner very warmly. " DEATH IN THE WORK-ROOM. " To the Editor of The Times. "Sir,—In my report read to the Yestry of St. James's, "Westminster, on Thursday last, on the premises occupied by "Madame Elise, 170, Regent Street, I stated that I had seen "two rooms in which were sixty young women working, and I "gave the measurements of these rooms as they were sent to me "by the Sanitary Inspector. I have since found that, through "the omission of a clerk in copying the document sent to me, "the whole contents of one of these rooms were omitted in my "calculation. I have accordingly paid a second visit to the "premises of Madame Elise, and have had the rooms measured "in my presence. I find that the cubical contents of the two "rooms give about 130 cubic feet of air to each of the sixty-two "women I there saw at work. I trust you will insert this "correction, which I feel it necessary to make in justice to "Madame Elise, whose establishment is not more to be con"demned than many others of a similar kind which exist in the "neighbourhood. Perhaps I may be permitted to add that there 49 "Since my own inspection I have had measure"ments made of all the upper rooms in each "house, and calculated their cubical contents, and "the Vestry will find these calculations in tables "which I now place before them. It will be seen "from these tables that there are 19 bed rooms "in all, containing accommodation for 74 persons. "is not a very definite view entertained by the public as to tlie "amount of space required indoors for healthy existence. In "this parish I have held that the minimum each adult should "have in a sleeping room is 300 cubic feet, and in a lodging or "sitting room 500 cubic feet of air. Of course the advantages "of even this space may be lost by want of ventilation, and a "smaller space, with good ventilation, may be free from "immediate bad effects. Unfortunately the most disastrous "consequence of a want of fresh air, I mean Consumption, "comes on so slowly that its presence is not felt until the victim "of impure air is too far gone to be rescued from the grave. "It is thus that workrooms are allowed to be overcrowded, to "the certain injury, sooner or later, of those that occupy them. "I know that in churches, schools, theatres, and other places of "public resort, there is frequently much less space than that "named above for breathing purposes ; but it must be re"collected that the occupation of these places is but for a short ''time, and that the occupants change the air they breathe at "intervals. Not so with the inhabitants of work-rooms and "work-shops, such as those filled with dressmakers, tailors, and "others. For many hours together they are obliged to breathe "the same air; and it is to the fact of the long and often "excessive hours of work to which I would attribute the "principal evil effects of the atmosphere they are in. A con"dition of things which may be borne without positive injury "for a few hours daily, becomes absolutely destructive to life 50 "The average cubical space for each person is 310 "feet. The 310 cubic feet of air is not however "distributed equally, as there were 11 rooms where "they have more than that quantity. In one "room the quantity of air for each individual is "but 120 feet, but the room in which the young "woman died contained above the average cubical "feet for each person in the bed rooms of the "establishment. "I shall not make any special remarks on the "case of the young woman, as that has been "legally investigated and a verdict delivered by a "jury. I would however remind you that the "when it has to be endured for a large number of hours without "sufficient rest, and with a system enervated by overwork. "I am, Sir, yours, &c. "EDWIN LANKESTER, M.D. "Medical Officer of Health, St. James's, Westminster." The Editor of The Times added the following note:— "We trust the Vestry will ask Dr. Lankester why he does "not do his own work, instead of leaving it to the carelessness "of a clerk. The least his employers can expect is that he "shall supervise the work of his own clerks." I should not have re-produced this note here on account of its intended censure, but it displays an utter ignorance of the duties of a Medical Officer of Health. It is not the "work" of that officer either to measure rooms or copy documents for the Vestry. Neither has he clerks in his employ whose work he can supervise. He is not so responsible to his "employers" for the clerical error in this case as the Editor of The Times to his "employers" for the frequent errors and inventions of his Penny-a-liners. 51 "case opens up the whole question of the internal "condition of the workshops, work-rooms, and "sleeping rooms of our city populations. It also "opens up the question of the number of hours "that persons may be employed consistent with "health in sedentary occupations in ill-ventilated "rooms. The question is one of the greatest "importance to the whole of the community, as it "involves the life and health of a very large class "of persons. There is no parish more interested "in this question than the Parish of St. James's, "there being a larger number of persons, in pro"portion to its population, working in shops and "work-rooms, than in any other parish in the "kingdom. It is also in this Parish that one of "the most densely populated and over-crowded "districts exists, and in which a large amount "of disease and death occurs from over-crowding, "or in other words the want of fresh air. With "regard to establishments like those of Madame "Elise, it is almost impossible without professional "oversight, to prevent over-crowding, in some "instances neither the heads of the establishments "nor the young persons in the house have "sufficient intelligence to know how to ventilate "rooms, and apply the many means which science "has suggested. It is a question well worthy the "consideration of the Legislature, whether some "systematic inspection under properly educated "officers might not take place. In all establish- 52 "ments where large numbers of persons are "domiciled, as in schools, workshops, &c. there "can bo no doubt but that the confinement of "young persons in close rooms for ten, twelve, "fourteen, and sixteen hours per day, must be "detrimental to health, and no amount of sleeping "space can make up for the destructive effect of "the confinement, when we add to this that in the "winter many of these rooms are lighted with gas, "and that each gas burner destroys as much air as "five persons, it is not to be wondered at that "occasionally a young woman dies, but rather that "the human system resists in so many cases the "destructive influences that are brought to bear "upon it." The result of my reports and investigation of this particular case was the determination of the Yestry to have inspected under my direction, the shops and work-shops in the Parish. The Sanitary Inspector commenced this work at the end of the month of July, and in the course of the next three months he inspected upwards of 100 shops and work-rooms, of which work you will find a summary in his report in the Appendix. On the 12th of November I reported that up to that time the Sanitary Inspector had "examined "96 work-rooms and shops, and up to the present "time has reported none that appeared to me to "call for immediate interference. When he has "completed his work, I shall lay before you a 53 "report and make such suggestions for alterations "as may appear to be demanded for securing the "health of those who occupy these rooms." As far as my present inquiries extend, it appears to me that there is much improvement to be made in the general condition of the workrooms. There is not sufficient regard paid to the ventilation of rooms where large numbers of work-people are employed. Individual instances have constantly come under my notice where young people are suffering for want of a sufficient supply of pure air. At certain seasons of the year they are employed for a larger number of hours than is consistent with health. This is especially the case with young people who live in the houses where they are employed. They commence work at an early hour in the morning, and do not leave off till a late hour at night, and no time is given them for exercise in the open air. The result of such occupation is especially seen in a tendency to disease of the lungs, and I attribute the great amount of fatal disease of the lungs in our Parish especially to this system. The system of working in rooms lighted with gas is especially injurious when the most effective means of getting rid of the poisonous exhalations of gas are not employed. There are many minor questions with regard to the employment of young persons in work-rooms, such as the influence of C 54 gaslight on the eyes, the time allowed them for their meals, and the quantity of air in their sleeping-rooms, which ought to be inquired into. These are some of the questions which I hope in future reports to be able to give you some definite information. COW-HOUSES. I have often called your attention to the difficulty of rendering cow-houses compatible with the health of the neighbourhoods in which they were situated. On the 29th of October, 1863, I made the following report:— "With regard to the cow-houses, I would "remind you that the Magistrates determined that "they would not renew the licences unless the con"ditions for their regulation which you had laid "down were complied with. One of the chief of "these conditions was, that the cow-houses should "not be overcrowded, but that each cow should "have at least a breathing space of 1000 cubic feet. "This condition I found in all cases, with one "exception, had been broken. In the Marshall "Street cow-houses I found in the first shed 400 "cubic feet for each cow, in the second 330 cubic "feet, and in the third 377. "In Pugh's Place there were 500 cubic feet to "each cow, in Blenheim Mews 500 cubic feet, in "William and Mary Yard in the first shed 600, "and in the second 750. In Ham Yard I found 55 "only four cows giving 1300 cubic feet to each, "but in the summer they had eleven cows in the "same shed, which would give not much more than "400 cubic feet for each cow. "With regard to paving, the cow-houses in New "Street is in a shocking condition, and contravenes "the first rule you require to be observed in the "management of cow-houses. "In the 7th rule you require that every cow"yard in which a cow-house shall be situated shall "be well paved. The cow-houses in William and "Mary Yard do not comply with this condition, as "the paving of the William and Mary Yard is the "most dilapidated and disgraceful piece of paving "in the Parish. Notices have in vain been served "on Mr. Reid, the Agent of Sir Walter Farquhar, "for the repair of this disgusting pavement, but "in vain. "It is difficult to know if the refuse is removed "three times a week, but from the universal "complaint of the intensely filthy smell of the "cow-house in New Street, I do not think it can "be regularly attended to in that place. Such is "the baneful influence of this cow-house on "health and decency, that I have dissuaded persons "from taking lodgings in the St. James's Model "Lodging House adjoining it. "I now strongly recommend you to act on "your own resolution of last year, to recommend "to the Justices the closing of all cow-houses in 56 "the Parish, seeing that every one of them have "broken the laws yon laid clown for their regulation, "and this after repeated warnings." The result of this report was your determination to recommend to the Magistrates the closing of all the cow-houses in the Parish, and this has now been effected, as there is no longer a cow-house in the Parish. I may state that the result has already been beneficial in a high degree. The property in the neighbourhood of the cow-houses has already improved, a better class of tenants occupy the houses, and no complaints are heard of the quality or quantity of the milk to be obtained in the Parish. CONCLUSION. There are many other subjects which I have brought before you in my fortnightly reports to which I might allude, but as my report has already extended to an unusual extent, I must defer them till another year. I have had little or nothing to report with regard to the supply of gas or the adulteration of food, as the apparatus which you have determined to erect is not yet in a sufficiently advanced state to be practically employed. I have also advocated the improvements in certain parts of the Parish by which property now covered with buildings which are injurious to the health of those who now occupy them would be removed, but as these improvements are in abeyance I defer for the present to dwell upon them. I have much pleasure 57 in placing in your hands this my eighth Report, as I am convinced it affords abundant evidence of the importance of the office I have the honour to hold in your Parish. In the census of 1861 I am returned as one of forty-seven health officers who exist in the United Kingdom. The Registrar observes, "This is a new Medical Office. Hitherto "the medical skill of the country has been usefully "employed in the treatment of the rich, but the "means of life-preservation was neglected, and was "rarely applied practically because it formed no "part of the business of the medical profession. "The Health Officers, few in number, have already "done incalculable good, and the local government "of no community is complete without them. The "conditions on which health depends are so various "as to require for their regulation the highest "order of medical education and talent." To have been one of the earliest to work this noble office will be a perpetual source of satisfaction to myself and of gratitude to you, whose generous confidence have been so abundantly testified in the readiness with which you have listened to and carried out my suggestions.
