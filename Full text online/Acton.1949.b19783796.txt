ACT S2 BROUGH OF ACTON annual report OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TOGETHER WITH THE Report on the medical inspection of schools for the Year 1949 ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1940. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Acton, W.3. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Acton. Ladies and Gentlemen, I submit the Annual Report of the health of the Borough of Acton for the year 1949. Under the Sanitaiy Officers Order of 1935 the duty is laid upon the Medical Officer of Health of familiarising himself with matters Meeting the health of the borough. Such information in the years Previous to 1948 was obtained in the course of one's duty ; now, as a part-time Area Medical Officer to the County, of Middlesex the inforination is still forthcoming. I feel that such information as has been submitted in previous years should still be given, and I am continuing to give some statistics of the work covering Maternity and Child Welfare, and School Health Service in the report. 4 The Registrar General estimates the population as, Civilian 67,690, and total as 67,740. The total figure 67,740 includes persons normally resident in Acton who are in the Military Services, and for statistical purposes I have based my calculations upon the civilian figure alone. A comparability factor has also been given for Acton and this factor is used to calculate the Corrected Death Rate. Until 1939 the population had for many years shown small change but there has been a change in the proportion of the constituent members of the population. During the period 1939 to 1945 a large number of persons came from Eire to work in this Borough and have remained; also there is an obvious settlement taking place of persons from Europe, and quite a number of persons of Polish nationality are establishing themselves, obtaining employment either here or outside this area. The Crude Death Rate is 10.8 and the Corrected Death Rate is 10.9, as compared with 9.4 for 1948. The Birth Rate is 15.4 as compared with 16.7 per 1,000 of the Civilian Population for 1948. Infantile Mortality Rate is 23.04 as compared with 24.4 in 1948, and for England & Wales is 32; County Boroughs and large towns (including London) is 37.0 There is no record of any child under the age of 2 years having succumbed to Gastro-Enteritis,. Infectious Diseases and other matters of interest I have dealt with in the body of the report. During, 1948 a scheme was designed to come into force in January 1949 for the Borough to be re-organised into 8 wards. Each ward elected three Councillors to serve on the Council and an Alderman was to represent each ward. The statistics are based on the new ward boundaries. 5 STAFF George E. B.

Laboratory Facilities : These continue as in previous years. The Ministry of Health Emergency Medical Service, Section 6, are providing a Pathological Service at the King Edward Memorial Hospital Laboratory at Ealing. 12 The following Table gives the types, and number, of specimens submitted for examination. Type No. of specimens examined Throat and Nose swabs 307 Sputum for T.B. 17 Faeces 54 Methylene Blue Reductase Tests on Milk and Ice-Cream 216 Ambulance Facilities. The Middlesex County Council are now responsible for this service. Nursing in the Home. This service has been taken over and is administered locally by the Middlesex County Council. The number of sick persons under care in Acton during the year was 564, necessitating 20,186 visits. Hospital Provisions. The Regional Hospital Boards of the N.W. Metropolitan Area which includes Acton is responsible for hospital treatment of the sick. The most difficult cases for which to obtain treatment are old persons,, or chronic sick who become acutely ill or who are in the terminal stage of, their illness. These types of cases need continuous care and treatment, and this cannot be given in the home. National Assistance Act, 1948. No cases have been dealt with under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, but in those cases which have come to our notice it has been possible, by co-operating with the local hospital, to arrange for these persons to be admitted. The Borough of Acton carries out its obligations under Section 50 of this Act. 13 Maternity and Child Welfare. Palmerston Road Mission Hall was opened as a Clinic for Welfare and Maternity purposes on the 8th March, 1948. There are therefore now five Centres accommodating six Health Visitors' districts. (1) The School Clinic, Avenue Road (two Health Visitors' districts served by this Centre). (2) Steele Road Mission Hall, Acton Green. (3) John Perryn School, East Acton. (4) St. Gabriel's Church Hall, Noel Road, North West Acton. (5) Palmerston Road Hall, South Acton. As in the previous year, two weekly sessions were held for each Health Visitor's district, one with a doctor in attendance, and one without. Average weekly attendances (last year's figures in brackets): — Central district 98.5 (99.1) South East 70.2 (82.3) South West 81.5 (88.8) North East 78.4 (94.2) North West 52. (52.3) West district 90. (86.1) Attached is a table showing the attendances at all Clinics and the visits paid by the Health Visitors to the homes. The numbers of mothers and children seen and treated at the Ophthalmic and Dental Clinics are given in the School Medical Report. Health Visiting. Number of visits paid during the year by all Health Visitors working in this area: To expectant mothers First visits 243 Total visits 362 To children under one year of age First visits 964 Total visits 2885 To children between the ages of one and five years Total visits 3320 14 Infant Welfare Centres. Total number of children who first attended the Centres during the year, and who, on the date of their first attendance were; Under one year of. age 950 Between the ages of one and five 96, Total number of children under 5 years of age who attended at the Centres during the year and who, at the end of the year were: Under one year of age 1015 Over one year 2016 Total number of attendances at Centres during the year: By children under one year of age 15550 By children between one and five years 7357 A total of 1,009 Toddlers attended the Welfare Centres during 1949 for a yearly examination. Midwifery Service. Domiciliary Midwifery was performed as in previous years by the Midwives of Queen Charlotte's Hospital. During 1949, 330 women were recommended for admission to Central Middlesex County Hospital for their confinements and the bulk of these were accepted. Ante-Natal Clinics. Four Ante-Natal clinics were held weekly at Avenue Road and a fifth session was held at the new Palmerston Road clinic. Number of new cases attending Clinics during year 1066 Total number of attendances made 3849 Average number attending weekly (5 clinics) 74 The arrangements made by women for their confinements are tabulated below: — % Confined in Central Middlesex County Hospital 38.8 Confined in Queen Charlotte's Hospital 17.3 Confined in other Hospitals 5.6 Confined in Nursing Homes 5.6 Confined at home (Queen Charlotte's Midwives attending) 32.1 Private Doctors and Midwives 5 | 15 Poif-Natal Clinics. The majority of women had their post-natal examination at hospital where they were confined, those confined at home being Examined at Queen Charlotte's Hospital. 9 women attended our cjjnic for their examination. Exercises Class for Mothers. The classes for expectant mothers were again a feature of the jinte-natal work, the total number of women attending in 1949 being 105 (the same figure as 1948). The total number of attendances was 1195 as compared with 2,756 for 194S. Birth Control Clinic. As in previous years, arrangements for this purpose with the North Kensington Women's. Welfare Association were continued, but as from the 26th May one clinic weekly was held at the Palmerston Road Hall, South Acton, a nominal fee being paid to the County Council for the use of, the premises. 10 patients were referred for advice in 1949. Home Help Scheme. At the end of the year there were 17 Full-time Domestic and Home Helps, and 24 Part-time Staff. The following Table shows the number of cases booked and those actually attended:— Maternity: Total number of Cases Booked 100 Number of Cases attended 74 Number of Cases cancelled 16 (Other arrangements made without notification to Town Hall) 10 T.B. Cases attended 24 Other Cases attended 282 Day Nurseries. The routine of the Day Nurseries was maintained during 1949 along the same lines as in previous years. The same four Nurseries 16 were in being, namely Bollo Bridge Road, Horn Lane, Friars Place Lane and ' Longcot ' the accommodation at these being as follows: Under 2 Over 2 Total Bollo Bridge Road 17 18 35 Horn Lane 25 35 60 Friars Place Lane 20 25 45 ' Longcot' Newton Grove 19 25 44 The numbers on the register at 31st December, 1949, were as follows: — Bollo Bridge Road Horn Lane 66 Friars Place Lane 49 ' Longcot' 49 The waiting list shows a decrease on the previous year's figure.

Immunisation was carried out along the lines indicated in previous reports. Advertisements were placed monthly in the local papers giving time and places of inoculaton clinics, and posters were displayed in prominent places. In addition to this, the following routine was practised: (1) A notice was sent to the parent of each 6 months' old child. (2) All infant Welfare attenders were approached. (3) All children admitted to Day Nurseries were offered protection (4) Health Visitors combed their districts for children who did not attend Welfares, and urged their protection (5) Head Teachers gave forms of consent to new school entrants. (6) Prior to school medical inspections, questionnaires were sent to each parent asking, inter alia, whether the child had been inoculated,. If the answer were in the negative a form of consent was sent to the parent. All immunised cases are followed up and, at the end of three years, each child is offered a boost dose. At the age of 11 years or over, this is preceded by a Schick test. All children under 5 who have not had the disease, are inoculated against Whooping Cough at the same time as they are inoculated against Diphtheria, i.e., they have three doses of protective material at monthly intervals. 56.3% of the population under 5 years of age is now protected, and 82.1% of the population aged 5 to 14.

Four cases of Diphtheria were notified during the year. Two in children 1-2 years; one between 3 and 4 years and one between 10 and 14 years. Of these cases, the last only was considered to be Diphtheria and it occurred in a boy who had been immunised but was due for a boost dose. There were no deaths from Diphtheria in immunised or non-immunised persons.. The number of cases of measles notified were 439, with two deaths, one in a child who was mentally backward (imbecile) and the other in a child who died under an operation for appendicitis,. and measles was considered a contributory cause of death. The case notified as Dysentery was on arrival at hospital diagnosed as enteritis, and salmonella typhi murium was isolated. Sixteen cases of Poliomyelitis were notified and three others were admitted to hospital as suspected Poliomyelitis,, but the diagnosis was not confirmed.. There were four deaths at ages 4 years a months, 4 years, 6 months, and 11 months. The four-year-old child was at school the day before he died, and the brother, six days after his brother was taken ill, was notified as suffering from Poliomyelitis. The brother, who was aged 6 years 4 months recovered. The ages of those who were affected but recovered were one under a year, one 11/4 years old, three 2 years old, one 3i years old, three 4 years old, one 6 years, old and one 9 years old. There were two adults—one female who worked at a hospital suffered a mild attack and the remaining case is interesting, being an adult male whose wife was working in the "Polio" ward of a large fever hospital. Another interesting case is that of a child who was taken ill at a holiday camp, saw the Camp Doctor who prescribed a tonic, and a few days after arriving home became weak in her limbs. The first case occurred in September and the last case on the 27th December. The majority of cases (10) were in the months of October. 3 in November and 3 in December. Two cases of food poisoning were notified in two separate families in which infection was not due to association. One boy came home ill from holiday camp and the salmonella typhi murium was isolated from the stool. 21 Year of Birth No. of Children Known Contact F. A. U.

Particulars of new cases and of deaths from the disease during 1949 are given below: 102 new cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and 5 cases of NonPulmonary Tuberculosis occurred during the year. There were 14 deaths from Pulmonary, and 2 deaths from Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis duing the year. The following Table gives the age incidence of new cases of the disease in 1949, and of deaths from the same cause. During 1949 I investigated the number of children who attended the Clinic whose parents or guardians were concerned about their child's health for such reasons as that a child was an intimate contact of a case of Pulmonary Tuberculosis or because the parents suspected the child had been in contact with a case of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. I included cases which the Clinic Medical Officers had referred to the Ealing Chest Clinic. I have tabulated the number of cases under the year of birth with the results of the investigation, and have traced the known contacts. The Patch Test is a method of ascertaining a person's reaction to tuberculosis, and employs a jelly which contains Tuberculin. This jelly is applied on a plaster to the skin for twenty-four hours. If a reddening of the skin occurs it is apparent that the person has, or has had, a Primary Complex. The ' Primary Complex' is a term used to denote that a young person has acquired a first infection due to the tubercle bacillus. It is believed that nearly all persons have such an infection and with treatment this condition should become quiescent or heal. But at a later date ill health associated with a further respiratory infection may cause this condition to flare up and cause Pulmonary Tuberculosis. 21 Year of Birth No. of Children Known Contact Neighbour Contact TYPE OF -INFECTION : Patch + Test Primary Complex Meningitis Pulmonary Tuberculosis M.

F = Farther. A = Aunt. U = Uncle. All known contacts suffered from Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Two cases of children not included had Surgical Tuberculosis (infection of a joint by tubercle bacilli). 22 From these figures one notices that of the 56 cases, nine developed a Primary Complex and one case had acute Meningitis, and the remainder were at the time free from infection. Eight had positive Patch Test and ten Were negative, and of the remaining thirty-eight no observations were made. Analysis of the Contacts shows that the source of the infection might arise in eight mothers, seventeen fathers, two aunts and one uncle, and six neighbours who were in the same house. Twentytwo contacts are named, but in several of these during the examination of the child the parent suspected, or vaguely suspected that the child had been in contact with a case of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. As the parent was not sure it was impossible to follow-up the contact, but the child was examined clinically and referred either to the Chest Clinic or kept under observation at the Clinic. I think these figures will illustrate the dangers of children in a house in which one of the members suffers from Pulmonary Tuberculosis. The dangers are greater if all the members sleep in the same room and this should be avoided. I then followed this investigation by Patch Testing a series of children known to be healthy and although six reacted positively, one was able to arrange for these to be examined at the Chest Clinic although three of the positive reactors were attending the Clinic and were considered non-infectious.

The Middlesex County Council are the sampling authority in this area, and the Chief Officer of the Public Control Department has supplied the figures appended below of samples taken during the year:— Article Taken Adulterated Milk 170 2 Antipain tablets 1 — Aspirin 1 — Black pudding 1 — Chewing gum 1 1 Coffee and chicory essence 1 — Cooked sausage 4 — Cream fancies 7 — Gelatine 1 — Gin 7 Goats Cheese 1 — Haddock smoked 6 — Ice-cream 1 — Lemon sole 1 — Liquorice, menthol and violet pellets 1 — Liver sausage 1 — Meat paste 1 — Meat savouries 2 — Meats cooked 2 Pork sandwich 2 Rum 2 Salad Cream 3 1 Sausage and sausage meat 1 — Sherbert 2 1 Sulphur tablets 1 — Whiskey 12 — 233 5 Two informal samples of milk were deficient in fat but subsequent follow-up samples were genuine. A sample of chewing gum was found to contain 95% of paraffin wax, but it was not possible to take any action under the Food and Drugs or Merchandise Marks Acts. No action was taken in the cases of a Salad Cream deficient in egg yolk solids and Sherbet deficient in sucrose. 29 SECTION C. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Water Supply. The Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board. The whole of the population is supplied from the public water mains direct to each house and the supply has been satisfactory. In addition to the public supply, there are three deep wells in the district, two at factory premises, and one at the Public Baths. Samples of water from these wells have been taken from time to time and on submission to bacteriological and chemical examinations have proved satisfactory. Drainage and Sewerage. All the dwelling houses are provided with water closets and are connected to the sewerage system which discharges,, by an arrangement with the L.C.C., into the London sewers. Stormwater is filtered and emptied into the Thames Public Cleansing. The amount of house refuse collected by the Council in 1949 was 16,527 tons and trade refuse collected amounted to 1,175 tons. A total weight of 10,463 tons was destroyed by destructor and 7,239 tons was removed to controlled shoots. In addition to the foregoing, 2,527 tons of Salvage was sold. Rodent Control. Treatment of the public sewers by the methods approved by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Infestation Control Division, and the consequent reduction of the rat population in the sewers, has undoubtly resulted in a lessened surface infestation. Maintenance treatment of factory and business premises by arrangements with the occupiers at the Council's approved charges has also reduced the need for intensive work on large infestations. More time has been devoted to investigation and treatment necessary in dwelling houses. 30 While complaints have been less frequent than hitherto, any reported nuisance has been the occasion for survey in the immediate area, and for treatment in accordance with block control as advocated by the Ministry. Investigations, destruction and maintenance have entailed a total of 2,213 visits by Rodent operatives, 1,631 to business premises and 582 to dwellings in addition to inspections by the Sanitary Inspectors as noted elsewhere. Inspection of Factories. There are 655 premises within the borough in connection with which the Sanitary Inspectors make inspection from time to time to ascertain that the provisions of the Factories Act, 1937, and the Sanitary Accommodation Regulations are complied with. In addition to this routine work, hygiene of canteens, etc., has received attention, and advice as to the fitness of food for human consumption given as necessary. The home addresses of 71 outworkers engaged in work at home for Factories within and outside the Borough, have been visited to ascertain hygienic.conditions and freedom from infectious disease. Sanitary Inspection of the Area. The following table includes the tabular statement by the Chief Sanitary Inspector under article 27 (18) of the Sanitary Officers (Outside London) regulations, 1935. Tabulated Statement of Inspections and Details of Work carried out by the Sanitary Inspectors. Number of Inspections made and Action taken:— Total number of dwelling houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health or Housing Acts) 3,187 (1) Dealt with by service of Informal Notice 1,222 (2) Dealt with by service of Statutory Notice under Section 9 Housing Act, 1936 505 31 (3) Dealt with by service of Statutory Notice under Public Health Acts 133 (4) No defects found 76 Premises (other than defective dwelling houses) inspected for nuisances and miscellaneous defects 2,841 (1) Dealt with by service of informal notice 112 (2) Dealt with by service of Statutory Notice under Public Health Acts, etc. 5 Reinspections subsequent to service of Notice 15,611 Inspections after notification of Infectious Disease 167 Premises inspected under Rats and, Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919, and Infestation Order, 1943 599 Details of Work carried out. The policy of requiring every possible house, flat or tenement to be rendered fit for human habitation in accordance with Section 9 of the Housing Act, '1936, has been maintained, and its effect is seen in the clearing up of many dilapidations and war damage repairs. In the course of normal procedure, 145 Statutory Notices were passed to the Town Clerk in default of the Owners not complying with the Council's requirements in due time. Delay has been attributed to a number of reasons. One common cause is the high cost of necessary repairs in relation to the income from property, while quite frequently a job cannot be proceeded with expeditiously on account of a claim by the owner awaiting decision by the War Damage Commission. The upper part of one house was closed under Section 12 of the Housing Act, 1936, being unfit for human habitation, and as it appeared that it could not be rendered fit at a reasonable cost. Subsequently the Owner carried out the necessary repairs and the closing order was determined The following table indicates the extensive and varied nature of the defects and dilapidations which have been made good following inspection by the Sanitary Inspectors.

The amount of foodstuffs surrendered owing to deterioration or damage is related to the extensive work of food manufacture and distribution in the Borough. Under the direction of the various Departments of the Ministry of Food, much inferior food material is received into the Borough for manufacturing purposes subject to control by the Local Authority, and the Sanitary Inspectors carry out necessary examinations to ensure that only sound material is used; this accounts generally for the bulk surrenders. Two large wholesale Grocery Depots are within the Borough, and hence surrenders of canned and packeted goods is to this Authority; these surrenders constitute the major part of such foodstuff noted. 34 The following list collated for convenience of record shews some details of the surrenders: — 5,217 containers milk 820 ,, preserves 2,420 „ fish 255 ,, beans and spaghetti 1,087 ,, savouries — soup, pickles, etc. 5,639 ,, fruit 75 packets suet 147 ,, barley flour 456 ,, Cereals, various 5 ,, Sweet fat 6 „ Dried egg 23 boxes French Cheese 4 tins Bacon 31 casks Condensed Milk 154 puddings (savoury or sweet) 5½ lbs.

Corned beef 461½ lbs. dried fruit 6 stones chitterlings 3 cwt. 2 qrs. 23 lbs. Strawberry pulp 9 cwt. 2 qrs. 24 lbs. Meat (misc.) 4 cwt. 2qrs. 20 lbs. Macaroni /spaghetti 5 cwt. Mixed cereals Apart from the foregoing list of surrendered food materials, there were 54 complaints with reference to various foods which were alleged to be contaminated. unsound, out of condition, or unfit for human consumption. All cases were dealt with by-way of special examination of (analysis, and where necessary, premises where manufacture, deposit or sale took place were inspected and circumstances applying to each case investigated, in order to prevent repetition of the cause for complaint. In three cases, the Council prosecuted the firms, or persons responsible for contravention of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, and fines were imposed by the local Magistrates and costs awarded. 35 The Council. The food comprised three loaves of bread in which found a cigarette end, a piece of wire, and a rusty nail respectively. Milk. In the course of frequent visitation by the Sanitary Inspectors &tothe eleven dairies in the Borough, they have been observed to be kept in good condition, and processes of bottling and distribution satisfactory. No complaints have been received as to any Dairy, and of 140 samples of Milk taken, only one failed in the Methylene Blue test; all Phosphatase tests proved satisfactory. The large wholesale pasteurising and bottling centre in Bollo Lane has been maintained in a highly satisfactory condition, and is subject to frequent visitation by Professional and Technical bodies account of the modem plant installation, working arrangements. for milk testing and bacteriological examination. During the year, 50 empty bottles taken from the filling lines of this centre, after cleansing in the mechanical bottle washers, were examined in the Pathological Laboratory of the Ministry of Health and all were found to be sterile. These results together with the invariably satisfactory reports of Methylene Blue and Phosphates tests, of the milk processing and bottling, indicate the high standard of efficiency maintained in the Centre. Ice Cream. There was no change during the year in the number of manufacturers of Ice Cream in the Borough, but the number of vendors at registered premises was increased to 68 This increase was due largely to the taking up of Agencies for manufacturers who distribute Ice Cream wrapped as briquettes or inclosed cups or cartons. The sale of Ice Cream in this way is an eminent improvement on the old time method of serving the commodity in cornets, cones or wafers from large containers of cream, though there may be no objection to the latter method under well controlled conditions. Samples of Ice Cream from all sources totalled 57, and confirmed a generally satisfactory state of manufacture and trading. Water. Samples of water for drinking and domestic purposes numbing 34 taken from various sources in the Borough were submitted 10 bacteriological examination and. all results indicated satisfactory supply. D'sease of Animals Act. An outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease involved the Borough, '"d restriction placed on the movement of cattle and pigs 36 sioned the granting of 274 Movement Licences for animals to be received into a slaughter house at Atlas Road. Slaughterhouses The Slaughterhouses in Adas Road and Hanbury Road, have been in commission throughout the year, and the carcase and offal of every animal slaughtered have been examined as to their fitness for human food. There was a reduction in the number of horses slaughtered for human food but it may be said that the quality of the flesh was superior to that from killings in previous years. The supply of bacon and pork was almost twice that of the previous year, and the table below indicates a much lower incidence of tuberculosis. No case of tuberculosis was recorded in respect of horseflesh.

The following is a report upon the schools and health of the schoolchildren of Acton for 1949. All existing clinics were open during the year. Furthermore, the services of a chiropodist were made available to the children during 1949 and weekly sessions were opened at Palmerston Road Mission Hall for that purpose. One case of Diphtheria was notified during the year, occuring in a child who had not had his boost dose. The percentage of schoolchildren inoculated against diphtheria was well maintained and on the whole showed a slight rise. Further details will be found in the report of the Medical Officer of Health. The School Meals Service showed considerable increase throughout the year. During 1942 an Acton expectant mother evacuated to Suffolk gave birth in May to triplets girls, and returned to Acton in November of the same year. All three children lived and were seen at School Inspection as Entrants in 1946, and again in 1949. The parents have cared for the children both in regard to body and mind, so that the children do not realise that being triplets is abnormal. I feel that placing on written record the observations made at the Welfare Clinic and School Inspections is of interest in view of the fact that the three children are strong and healthy. Twin births are common (one in 89) but triplet births are rare 40 (One in 7,910). From the notes I append the table showing weight of the triplets at various stages: Date First Child's weight. Second Child's weight. Third child's weight. At Birth 4 lbs. 15 oz. 4 lbs. 6 oz. 3 lbs. 10 oz. 9.11.42 14 lbs. — 13 lbs. 15 oz. 11 lbs. 4½ oz. 12.11.46.

On the 9th November, 1942, the family had returned from Suffolk and it is reported that the two elder triplets were on feeds of Ostermilk and that the youngest one was being breast fed, with Ostermilk as supplementary feeds. At this time the eldest triplet was attempting to sit up in her cot. To all three halibut oil and orange juice were recommended. All the trio had been vaccinated. On the 27th January, 1943 the triplets were on National Dried Milk, and were having broth, Farex and rusks. The second of the triplets had swollen gums (teething). During 1944 the family returned to Suffolk but were in Acton on 14th September 1945 when the Health Visitor reported the children were on a mixed diet; their nutrition satisfactory and all three had 20 teeth. Their habits were clean and they were making normal progress both mentally and in their speech. They had been immunised against diphtheria. On the 23rd March 1946 it was reported that they were on a progressive mixed diet; all were very active physically but the two youngest were "rather thin" and the eldest was thin and pale. They attended nursery class at 4½ yrs. of age. When seen at medical inspection their nutrition was graded as 'B' and the mental condition was noted as " Good". No congenital defects were noted and all three were physically fit. They had received a 'boost dose' against diphtheria and had suffered only from Rubella and measles. 41 The dental card shows that in 1948 the two elder triplets had no dental caries whilst the youngest needed dressings to her teeth in 1948 and 1949. As will be noted, this is a very fine effort on the parents part have reared such fine and healthy triplets during the difficult period of 1939 to 1945.
