To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea,, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my second annual report on the health of the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea for the year ending 31st December, 1951. The report has been prepared in accordance with the desires of the Minister of Health as expressed in Circular 42/1951, dated 10th December, 1951. In various sections of the report a review of the local progress made in that particular field of Public Health during the past 50 years is undertaken. Where appropriate, graphs have been prepared to illustrate the position. The Registrar-General's estimate of the population as at mid-1951 is 52,430, as compared with 52,490 in 1950; these figures, however, include military personnel stationed in the Borough. Last year they were estimated to number 150 and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary it can only be assumed that the civilian population has decreased by sixty. The number of Live Births recorded was 819, a decrease of ten compared with 1950. Of this total 420 were Males and 399 Females, deficiences of 6 and 4 respectively compared with the preceding year. The birth rate is 15.6 - a decline of 0.2. There was a decrease in the number of Still Births which totalled 20 (Males 12:Females 8) as compared with 24 (Males 12 : Females 12) last year. The respective rates are 23.8 and 28 .1. The death rate advanced to 13.1 being 0.9 above the figures attained in 1950 (12.2)• The average for the ten years 1930 - 1939 was 13.5. If it were possible for the populations of all areas to be similarly constituted as regard the proportions of their sex and age components, their crude death rates (deaths per 1,000 of population) could be accepted as valid comparative measures of the mortalities experienced by the populations. In practice, however, populations are not so constituted, and the Registrar-General has, therefore, employed a factor known as the "Area Comparability Factor" for each district. This provide® for an adjustment of the age and sex composition of a particular area to that of England and Wales as a whole, so that a statistical basis 6 can be established. To obtained the adjusted death rate, the crude death rate is multiplied by the "Area Comparability Factor", and as 0.94 represents the "Factor" so far as Chelsea is concerned, the adjustment results in a death rate of 12.3. It is most satisfactory to report that no deaths have occurred as a result of accidents or diseases associated with pregnancy or puerperal pyrexia since 1946. During the years 1940 to 1946, eleven deaths were registered from these causes. Deaths of infants under one year of age have again fallen, only nineteen occurring during 1951. The infantile mortality rate of 23.2 is the lowest ever recorded in Chelsea. A perusal of the short summary set out below will clearly indicate how the enormous wastage of life in this particular age group has been very considerably reduced:- Year Deaths under one year of age No. of births registered Rate per 1.000 registered births 1900 333 2,245 148 1910 141 1,376 102 1920 73 1,392 52 1930 32 799 40 1940 15 428 40 1950 21 829 25 1951 19 819 23 It will be noted that since 1940 there has been an apparent tendency for the dramatic improvement of the early decades of the century to decline. The rate, however, must be viewed in conjunction with the actual number of deaths and births registered. It will be seen that there has been a much greater proportionate reduction in the number of deaths than in the number of births. Infectious Diseases. The number of notifications received during 1951 showed a sharp increase as compared with 1950 (837) and 1949 (616), and totalled 1,031. The incidence of Measles alone was responsible for 669 notifications, or some 65 per cent of the aggregate. No fatality oocurred among these measles cases - a happy contrast with the farmer case mortality which varied between 1.4 per cent and 4.0 per cent in the earlier decades of the century. As a general rule eighty or ninety per cent of all persons attaining to the age of twenty years have had measles, and of the 1,289 notifications received during the last three years, approximately 96 per cent of the sufferers were aged between 0 and 15 years. The figures for the past 7 years conform to the well-known biennial periodicity of measles which also shows a fairly constant phasic pattern within each twoyear cycle. Notifications of Food Poisoning fell from 122 (of which four cases terminated fatally) in 1950, to 13 last year. Food and Drugs. As is customary, four hundred samples were examined and reported upon by the Council's Public Analyst, Mr. T. McLachlan. A comprehensive account of his work during the year is included in this report. 7 Food Hygiene. A close supervision is strictly maintained on all premises concerned with the preparation, storage, and sale of food, whilst the manufacturers, caterers, and shopkeepers are constantly reminded of their responsibilities to the general publico Ice Cream is a commodity which calls for a high level of hygienic consideration, and the attention it has received from my officers is apparent from an examination of the section devoted thereto. Housing Conditions. The provision and maintenance of satisfactoryhousing conditions continues to receive the active attention of both District and Housing Inspectors as required by the various Acts, Orders and Regulations governing this part of a local authority's responsibilities. An additional Sanitary Inspector was appointed during the year to deal mainly with the supervision of food premises and certain provisions of the Factories Act, 1937. Inspections, It will be seen that the work of the Department continues to increase, and in passing I would indicate that the number of visits and inspections aggregated 22,223, as compared with 19,350 in 1950. Welfare of Old People, Every endeavour is made to bring some measure of happiness and freedom from care into the lives of those who by reason of advanced age or infirmity are unable to lead a full life, and an account of the many and varied facilities available will be found in this report, I record with sincere gratitude the keen interest and support which the Chairman and Members of the Public Health and Baths Committee have consistently shown in all the problems it has been my duty to place before them, I have been particularly appreciative of the courtesy and consideration which they and Members of other Committees have extended to me. I would also like to express my gratitude to all members of the Public Health Department for the loyal and zealous manner in which they have performed their particular duties, I am, Madam Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J.H. WEIR Medical Officer of Health. 8 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF CHELSEA ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1951 i POPULATION: Registrar-General's estimate of the population of the Borough (mid-year, 1951) 52,430 AREA OF THE BOROUGH: 660 acres LIVE BIRTHS Total M.

The infant mortality rates for England and Wales, and London were 29.6 and 26.4 respectively. Thirteen of the deaths recorded were in infants under four weeks of age. Deaths were attributed to:- Atelectasis 3 Influenzal Meningitis 1 Broncho—pneumonia 1 Misadventure 1 Congenital malformations 2 Pneumonia 1 Erythroblastosis 1 Prematurity 7 Gastro-enteritis 1 Sarcoma of lower jaw 1 Whilst it is of interest to record that the death rate of infants under the age of one year is the lowest ever obtained in the Borough, it is far more satisfactory to observe that the actual number of deaths has steadily decreased over the last half oentury.

One notification was received, but this was finally diagnosed as "acute tonsilitis". Notifications received and confirmed during 1948 and 1949 were 2 and 1 respectively, and only one death has occurred during the past thirteen years. Set out below are details of notifications of and deaths from Diphtheria from 1900 to 1951. Year Cases Deaths 1900 179 18 +1901^-1910 108.3 9.7 +1911-1920 84.3 6.1 +1921-1930 133.7 6.2 +1931-1940 93.7 3.2 +1941-1950 10.6 0.1 + Averages over periods of ten years. The very sharp decline in the incidence of Diphtheria during the period 1941-1950 is, to some extent, attributable to the outbreak of hostilities prior to the commencenent of this particular decade, with the consequent evacuation of children to safer areas, but it must be borne in mind that by mid 1947 the population (51,000) was again approaching pre-war levels. The average numbers of cases and deaths for the five years 1947-1951 were 2 and Nil respectively. Immunisation which is commented upon elsewhere, has played a major part in, from a statistical point of view, the present excellent position; nevertheless it is constantly necessary to publicise the efficacy of such a service. 19 DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION-1951 Number of children at 31st Decembers 1951 who had completed a course of Immunisation at any time before that date (i.e. at any time since 1st January, 1937). Age at 31st December, 1951. i„e. Born in year Under 1 1 2 3 4 5 to 9 10 to 14 1951 1950 1949 1948 1949 19A2-1946 1937-1941 Number Immunised 20 310 438 475 517 2,015 1,235 Total under 15 years of age 5,010 The Registrar-General has estimated the child population of Chelsea to be 7,983, made up as follows:- Children under five years of age 3,693 Children between 5 and 14 years 4,290 7,983 The percentage of the child population between the years 0. to 15 who have benefited from the advantages of Diphtheria Immunisation is approximately 63, whilst the percentages for the age groups 0 and under 5, and 5 and under 14, are approximately 47 and 75 respectively. It will be obvious, therefore, that the Immunisation service is not being accepted as it should, because it is held that a percentage of 80 is necessary to ensure a level of immunity sufficient to minimise the possibility of any substantial outbreak of diphtheria, The London County Council, the authority responsible for Immunisation, is taking steps to publicise the dangers which may arise from the present indications of misplaced complacency. 20 MEASLES Six hundred and sixty-nine notifications of Measles were received in the Public Health Department during 1951, as compared with 318 and 302 in 1950 and 1949 respectively. POLIOMYELITIS Two notifications of Poliomyelitis came to hand, only one of which was subsequently confirmed; the latter was of a non-paralytic type, and the patient, after receiving hospital treatment, and subsequent discharge, has enjoyed good health. There were three confirmed cases in 1950. SCARLET FEVER The figures for the year showed a very great improvement, only twenty-nine notifications being received, representing only about 53.0 per cent of those notified in 1950 ( 55). DYSENTERY There was also a welcome decline in the notifications of Dysentery received-95 as compared with 117 in 1950. It must be stressed that practically 95 per cent of the sufferers were residents of institutions not controlled by this authority. The premises concerned were of a type not conducive to the adequate control of the persons amongst whom this disease was rife, and the Borough Council has been at great pains to bring about the eradication of the incidence of dysentery. 21 FOOD POISONING A considerable decrease in the number of cases of Food Poisoning occurred during the year. These totalled 13 as compared with 122 in 1950, whilst four of the latter succumbed to the effects of food poisoning. It has to be recorded that the fatalities occurred in premises over which this authority exercised no supervision,, A summary of all cases occurring during the year under review is set out below in identical form to that supplied to the Ministry of Health. Annual Return of Food Poisoning Notifications Notifications of the occurrence of Food Poisoning were received as follows:- First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Total 1 7 4 1 13 Outbreaks (other than family outbreaks) due to identified agentss- NIL Family Outbreaks due to Identified agents NIL Outbreaks (other than Family Outbreaks) of undiscovered causes- NIL Family Outbreaks of Undiscovered cause Total Outbreaks: 1 Total Cases: 4 Single Case3 8- Agent identified: 1 (Salmonella typhi-murium) Unknown causes: 8 Total cases: 9 22 SMALLPOX No case of Smallpox has been notified as having occurred in the Borough since 1928. The following table briefly sets out the incidence of this disease during the last fifty-two years. Notifications received Deaths 1900 2 1 1901 5 1 1902 38 7 1903 6 - 1904-1919 - - 1920 1 - 1921-1927 - - 1928 1 - 1929-1951 - - The annual average of notifications received and the death rate for the period under review are, therefore 1,019 and 0.17 respectively. It will be observed that in 1902 a very serious outbreak of Smallpox occurred. Although only 38 cases were notified, 47 came to the notice of the Medical Officer of Health. During the same year, 7,797 cases were notified in the County of London. Case rates per 10,000 of population in this and adjacent Boroughs, were as follows:- CHELSEA 5.8 Kensington 6.4 Fulham 7.4 Paddington 9.2 Hammersmith 12.3 Westminster 18.5 County of London 20.6 23 ZYMOTIC DISEASES The term 'Zymotic' was at one time applied to a considerable number of diseases which were "epidemic, endemic and contagious", Now, however, it is considered relevant to such diseases as cholera, diarrhoea, diphtheria, measles, scarlet fever, smallpox, typhoid and typhus fevers. In 1951 the Zymotic Death Rate in Chelsea was 0.09 per ls000 of the population: the corresponding figure in 1900 was 2.26. It is far more significant to translate these rates into actual figures as will be appreciated from the fact that whilst in 1951 five deaths were attributed to Zymotic Diseases, a total of two hundred and ninteen occurred in 1900. The numbers of deaths at other periods during the last half-century are as follows 190 5 98 1910 66 1915 76 1920 41 1925 29 1930 22 1935 17 1940 1 1945 6 1950 3 TUBERCULOSIS 90 cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis were notified during the year. These were made up of 59 primary notifications, 27 "inward transfers", and 4 from death returns. There were also 7 non-pulmonary cases, of which 4 were primary notifications, 2 "inward transfers", and 1 death return,, The accompanying tables present details of cases at present on the Tuberculosis Register. - 24 - (A) NEW CASES OF TUBERCULOSIS DURING 1951 (B) DEATHS FROM TUBERCULOSIS DURING 1951 Under 1 year 1 and under 2 years 2 and under 5 years . 5 and under 10 years 10 and under 15 years 15 and under 20 years 20 and under 25 years 25 and under 35 years 35 and under 45 years 45 and under 55 years 55 and under 65 years 65 and under 75 years 75 years and upwards TOTALS (all ages) (A) NEW CASES Pulmonary M — - - 1 - 2 6 24 11 3 2 3 - 52 Pulmonary F - - 1 - - 3 5 16 6 4 1 1 1 38 NonPulmonary M — — — 1 — — — 1 — — — — 1 3 NonPulmonary F - - - - 1 — 1 2 - - - - - 4 (B) DEATHS Pulmonary M — — — — — — — 3 - 1 6 1 4 15 Pulmonary F — — — - - — — 2 — 1 - - 2 5 NonPulmonary M — — — — — — — — — — — — — — NonPulmonary F - - 1 - - - - — - - - - - 1 25 TUBERCULOSIS (Continued) VARIATIONS IN REGISTER DURING 1951 PULMONARY NON-PULMDNARY ' TOTAL CASES (a) Number of cases remaining on register at 1st January, 1951 M.

As a result of examinations made, the following data has been compiled:- Results of examinations Male Female Total Number satisfactory 2,346 2,147 4,493 Number unsatisfactory and referred to their private doctors:- (a) Probably tuberculous 21 16 37 (b) Non-tuberculous 4 3 7 Number of examinations not completed 3 4 7 Number of persons who failed to attend for further examination 5 5 10 2,379 2,175 4.554 It is understood that a Mobile Unit will be again located at the Chenil Galleries during the summer of 1952. 26 TUBERCULOSIS DISPENSARY During the past three years, the following work was carried out at the Tuberculosis Dispensary. 1242 1250 1951 Number of notified cases of Tuberculosis on register at end of year 415 425 411 Number of such cases who failed to attend at the Dispensary 262 284 279 Total attendances during the year 1,979 1,823 1,834 Total number of persons referred to Dispensary by their doctors 363 377 389 Number of these who were oontaots 106 163 170 Number of cases newly notified to Medical Officer of Health, exclusive of inward transfers. 67 78 72 Number of oases diagnosed as tuberoulous at the Dispensary during the year 15 21 24 Number of X-ray examinations 1,084 1,137 1,301 Number of Mantoux tests 59 201 199 Number of sputa examinations 179 265 311 Number of patients who reoeived artificial pneumo-thorax refills during the year L 15 29 47 Number of patients who reoeived "special treatment" at home - 11 12 Number of patients given "B.C.G." - 11 15 Number of home visits by medical staff - 14 31 Number of visits made by Dispensary Nurse 2,004 1,866 2,436 Number of visits made by Dispensary Almoner 387 301 137 Number of Clinic sessions per week 2 2 2 Child contacts are frequently referred to the Children's Contact Investigation Department, Brompton Hospital, for supervision# Suoh "followup" work as may be necessary is done by the Dispensary's staff. 27 SANITARY ADMINISTRATION OF THE BOROUGH SUMMARY OF WORK PERFORMED BY THE SANITARY INSPECTORS DURING THE YEAR 1951 Number of complaints received during the years- 1,344 INSPECTIONS: DWELLINGS Houses inspected after complaints 4,343 Houses inspected after Infectious Disease. 2,158 House-to-House inspections 2,396 Underground Rooms 890 Overcrowding and "Permitted Numbers". 373 Visits to obtain information re Housing applications 73 Lodging Houses 1 Inspection of Council flats for vermin 34 Other visits 27 10,255 FOOD PREMISES Butchers 89 Horseflesh Dealers 1 Fishmongers and Fish Friers 88 General Provision Shops, including Delicatessen Shops 184 Dairies and General Stores selling Milk 93 Ice Cream Vendors (Premises, Stalls, Vehicles, &c.) 92 Ice Cream Manufacturers 237 Bakehouses and Underground Bakehouses 80 Street Stalls and Barrows 70 Food Factories (Mechanical) other than Bakehouses 23 Food Factories (Non-mechanical) other than Bakehouses 10 Hotels, Restaurants and Dining Rooms. 722 Premises in connection with Unsound Food. 1,049 Premises in connection with Sampling. 173 Other Food Premises 272 3,183 FACTORIES AND OUTWORKERS Factories-other than Food Factories (Mechanical) 196 Factories-other than Food Factories (Non-Mechanical) 119 Outworkers 27 Other visits (not classified) 3 345 DRAINAGE Drains tested-by water 249 Drains tested-by smoke 146 Drains tested-by air 69 Final tests after repair or reconstruction 56 Drains traced by colour 108 628 Carried forwards 14,411 28 SUMMARY OF WORK PERFORMED BY THE SANITARY INSPECTORS DURING THE YEAR 1951 (Continued) INSPECTIONS (Continued) Brought forward: 14,411 MISCELLANEOUS Public Conveniences and Hotel Conveniences accessible from the street 17 Internal Conveniences at Cinemas, Theatres, Hotels &c. 3 Animals, poultry and birds 9 Open spaces, highways, allotments, fairgrounds, etc. 138 Office premises 7 Marine Stores and Second-hand Dealers' premises 4 Premises under Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933 73 Premises to enforce requirements of Shops Act. 95 Visits to premises re Voluntary works 3,739 Visits to Owners, Builders and Agents offices. 378 Smoke observations 26 Food poisoning 26 Fumigation of furniture 10 Visits to Aged and Infirm Persons 267 Visits to Verminous Persons 20 Visits to premises which resulted in "no access" 1,786 Premises other than dwellings after infectious disease 8 Other visits 1,206 7,812 TOTAL: 22,223 29 WORKS SUPERVISED BY THE SANITARY INSPECTORS FACTORIES ACS 1937 HOUSING ACT, 1936 PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1936 FOOD & DRUGS ACT, 1938 TOTAL N. v.

TINNED During the Summer, a very large amount of tinned ham had to be condemned as unsound, a matter which was the subject of a report to the Public Health and Baths Committee on 2nd October, 1951. At the time of the report, 1,210 lbs. of tinned ham had been condemned as unfit for human consumption. One of the factors of interest was in the different nature of defect in different tins. Some showed signs of liquefaction only, other liquefaction and gas, others no obvious change, but had offensive smelle Another point about these hams was that they appeared quite normal but might "blow" very rapidly in a few days. The hams had come from most of the European countries, few having any indication on the pack that they were not of a full-keeping quality. Some indicated that they were perishable and should be kept under refrigeration, but shopkeepers had no control over non-refrigerated storage in wharves, in wholesale warehouses, or in transit, and no refrigerated accommodation to store tinned hams in bulk. Samples of different types were submitted to the Central Public Health Laboratories for examination, which revealed that most of the tins under examination contained bacteria, and it seemed, in many instances, that the pickle used for curing had not retarded the multiplication of such organisms. Advice was given that these canned meat packs should not be accepted unless clearly marked with directions as to the correct temperature of storage and keeping time; there should be powers to enforce the conditions for storage. 38 The facts were reported to the Ministries of Food and Health, who undertook to communicate with the countries concerned, with the trade, and with individual canners. Subsequently, the Council approached the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee with a request that this problem should be brought to the attention of the Ministries for Food and Health. In addition to verbal advice given to traders by the Council's Food Inspectors, I addressed a circular letter to all local firms concerned in the sale of tinned hams. In this, attention was drawn to the position, and advice given regarding sale and storage, and it was intimated that the services and knowledge of the Departmental Staff were at the disposal of the traders whose co-operation was invited. The Ministry of Food duly contacted the appropriate authorities in the countries concerned, and I am pleased to report, that although 3,775 pounds of tinned hams were condemned as unfit for human consumption during the year, the wastage of this particular commodity had almost been arrested at the end of 1951. (By 31st March, 1952, it had only been necessary for the Public Health Department to condemn some 95 lbs. of tinned ham). 39 DISINFECTION AND DISINFLATION The following is a summary of the work carried out by the Council®s staff at the Disinfecting Station and Cleansing Centre during the yeart- (a) SCABIES Treatments were carried out as followss:- Cases Treatments Adults (Males) 2 2 Adults (Female s) 5 13 Children 11 17 (In addition to figures shown abovey 9 children attending London County Council schools were given 14. treatments,) (b) VERMINOUS CONDITIONS Details of work in this connection are set out belows:– Cases Treatments Adults (Males) 3 4 Adults (Females) 221 221 Children HI 111 (354 treatments were also given to London County Council school children.)

A consideration of the table set out below will clearly emphasise the excellent standards now attaining in respect to Ice Cream. Grading 1949 1950 1951 No. of samples Percentage of total No. of samples Percentage of total No. of samples Percentage of total I 11 19.7 63 59.4 50 83.3 II 13 23.2 27 25.5 7 31.7 III 13 23.2 13 12.3 – – IV 19 33.9 3 2.8 3 5.0 TOTALS: 56 100.0 106 100.0 60 100.0 It will be readily apparent that whilst the percentage of satisfactory (Grades I & II) samples has risen from 42.9 in 1949 to 95.0 in 1951, the percentage of unsatisfactory (Grades III & TV) has fallen from 57.1 to 5.0 in the same period. Traders whose products are reported as "unsatisfactory" receive notification of the adverse findings. Ice Cream manufactured in other areas, and which is poorly graded, is the subject of communication to the particular Medical Officers of Health. Details of Ice Cream which has been chemically examined will be found in the section devoted to "Food and Drugs" on page 56. 44 MILK SUPPLY Under the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, a local authority is required to keep a register of all persons carrying on the trade of milk distributor, and of all premises used as dairies (other than dairy farms) in their district, and to remove from the register the name of any person who ceases to trade as a milk distributor, and of any premise which ceases to be used as a dairy premise. On 31st December, 1951, entries in the register were as followst- (a) Number of registered distributors with premises in the Borough 35 Number of registered distributors other than those included in (a) above 14 Number of premises in Chelsea registered as dairies II Number of premises in Chelsea, other than dairies, from which milk is distributed 33 During the year, 96 applications were received, and principal licences were granted under the Milk (Special Designation)(Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949, and the Milk (Special Designation )(Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949, authorising the use of special designations in relation to milk sold at or from premises within the Borough. 37 supplementary licences were granted in respect of milk sold by retail within the Borough from 15 premises not situate in the area of this authority. Details of licences granted were as follows:– Type of Licence Tuberculin Tested Accredited Pasteurised Sterilised TOTALS Principal 27 7 34 30 98 Supplementary 11 – 14 12 37 On the 1st October, 1951, the Milk (Special Designations)(Specified Areas) Order, 1951, came into foroe for the whole of the County of London. After this date it was illegal for any person to sell by retail for human consumption any «ilk other than milk which may be sold as specially designated milk in accordance with the provisions of the Milk (Special Designation)(Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949, and the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949, and it was necessary for all rertaQars selling milk in the area specified (whether or not their premises were situated in such area) to be licensed by the appropriate authority to use a special designation in relation to milk. All retailers selling milk within the Borough have now been licensed to use special designations. No pasteurisation or sterilisation of milk took place in the Borough during the year, such processes having been carried out in other areas. 45 RAG PLOCK AMD OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT. 1951. The Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951? came into force on 1st November, 1951* and brought about the repeal ofi- The Rag Flock Acts of 1911 and 1928, and Section 136 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. The new Act represents a consolidation of the 1911 and 1928 Acts, and extends control to a large number of filling materials in order to ensure the cleanliness of same. The following is a list of filling materials within this Act, and to which the term "clean" is applicablet- (a) rag flock, (b) unwoven cotton, cotton linters, cotton millpuffs, cotton felt, cotton flock, (c) unwoven wool, woollen flock, (d) jute, (e) unwoven synthetic fibres, synthetic fibre flock, (f) hair, (g) feathers or down, (h) kapok, (i) coir fibre, Algerian fibre, Mexican fibre, sisal, (j) seaweed, seagrass, Spanish moss, (k) straw or chaff, (1) such other materials as may be prescribed. "Rag Flock" means flock which has been produoed wholly or partly by tearing up spun or woven or knitted as ffeltofl materials, whether old or new9 but does not include flock obtained wholly in the processes of the scouring, milling or finishing of newly-woven or newly-knitted or newly-fitted fabrics. 14 is the duty of a local authority toj- (i) Secure registration of premises used for upholstering and similar processes? (ii) Issue licences in respect of premises used for the manufacture, or for storing, of rag flock; (iii) Arrange periodic inspection of all registered and licensed premises, inspection of premises where it is believed filling materials, etc., are held for sale or offered or exposed for sale, inspection of premises believed to be subject to registration, and premises where it is believed that rag flock is manufactured or kept, etc.; (iv) Ensure that occupiers of registered and licensed premises keep proper records relating to filling materials and rag flock; (v) Arrange for the taking of samples of filling materials by an authorised offioer, and for testing by an Analyst prescribed by regulations, or by the Public Analyst; and (vi) Take proceedings for offences under the Act. Eight applications were received from persons using premises in connection with upholstering or similar processes, and in each case a fee of £L.0.0o was paid for the registration of the premises concerned. In each instance the Public Health Committee expressed its approval to registration. 46 RODENT CONTROL The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, which became operative on 31st March, 1950, is much more advantageous to a local authority in dealing with rodents than the Rats and Mice Destruction Act, 1919, which has been repealedo The new Act empowers a local authority to take all practicable measures to rid its area of rats and mice,, Under the provisions of the Rats and Mice Destruction Act, 1919, the primary duty for the eradication of these particular pests rested upon the individual occupier. With the advent of this new legislation, an occupier is guilty of an offence if he fails to destroy rodents, or use his best endeavours to prevent an infestation There has always been co-operative action between owners, occupiers and the local authority in this borough# Details of woric carried out in this connection during "the year are as follows l. Treatment of Business and Private Premises Business Premises Private Premises Number of visits made 33 302 Number of infestations found 33 297 Number of treatments undertaken 28 291 Number of pre-baits laid 1,800 Number of poison baits laid 671 Number of complaints received 373 2.

Russell, Medical Officer for Division I of the London County Council, (which comprises the Boroughs of Chelsea, Fulham, Hammersmith and Kensington) has kindly supplied information in connection with the above services, which have, of course, been the responsibility of the London County Council since the National Health Service Act, 1946, came into force in July, 1948. WELFARE CENTRES Attendances at Ante-Natal & Post-Natal Sessions 1,773 Attendances at Infant Welfare Sessions 8,325 HEALTH VISITING Number of visits carried out by Health Visitors in respect of:- Premature Infants 17 Infants under 1 year 2,837 Childreaibetween 1 and 5 years 5,910 Unsuccessful visits 2,318 1 Expectant Mothers 882 Stillbirths 9 Infectious Diseases 348 Miscellaneous 485 12,806 FOSTER MOTHERS Number of registered foster mothers 8 Number of children in their care 14 DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION Number of children who completed a primary course of injections 465 Number of children who received reinforcing injections 316 VACCINATION • Number of children who were vaccinated at the Violet Melchett Infant Welfare Centre 468 48 PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT, 1933 The provisions of the Act and the Poisons Rules relating to the retailing of poisons specified in Part II of the Poisons List were administered throughout the year. The number of listed sellers placed on the Council's register was 50 (47 retentions and 3 new applications). The sums received as payment of fees totalled £12.17s.6d. As a general rule the poisons retailed were insecticides, rodent exterminants, hair dyes, and household ammonia, sales being made from the premises of general and hardware storekeepers, grocers and hairdressers. All applications are investigated to ensure that records are properly maintained, labelling efficiently performed, storage accommodation is adequate, and that sales sure only made by employees nominated on application forms. In every instance it was found that the requirements of the Act and Poisons Rules were being complied with, whilst subsequent enquiries revealed that all concerned were well aware of their responsibilities in such matters. Applications for inclusion and/or retention in the Council's register are considered by the Public Health and Baths Committee each Spring. When approval has been expressed to applications, appropriate entries are made for a period of twelve months (1st May to 30th April). 49 UNSOUND FOOD Some 9,788 pounds of unsound or diseased food were surrendered to and destroyed by the Council's Food Inspectors during the year. This exceeds the aggregate for 1950 by approximately 67 pounds. The foodstuffs lareely dealt with were as followss lbs. Fish, fresh 327 Fish, tinned 402 Fruits, tinned 2,184 Fruit juices 165 Ham, tinned 3,775 Meat, tinned 830 Milk, tinned 241 Preserves - Jams, Marmalades, etc 77 Sausages 300 Soups 132 Vegetables709 Particular reference to the large amount of tinned ham condemned during 1951 will be found on page37. WATER The Metropolitan Water Board is responsible for supplies of water for commercial and domestic use throughout the Borough, During the year, twenty-three samples were examined and found to be satisfactory. One was secured from private premises, whilst all the others were secured at the Public Baths4 The foilcwing provisions were also mades- Supplies to tenements 10 Taps on mains far drinking purposes 6 Storage tanks cleaned, covered or repaired 15 PUHLIC MORTUARY There are no mortuary premises situate in the Borough but by virtue of an agreement with Hammersmith Borough Council adequate facilities are, readily available at that authority's mortuary in Fulham Palace Road. During 1951, two hundred and twelve bodies were admitted to the Mortuary, and in every instance a post-mortem was performed, whilst inquests were held in thirty-four cases. 50 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT. 1948 BURIAL OR CREMATION OF THE DEAD (Section 50) In accordance with the provisions of the above Act, the Borough Council is required to make arrangements for the burial or cremation of the body of any person in respect of whom no other suitable action can be taken. During the period 5th July to 31st December, 1948, the Borough Council was responsible for the interment of forty-three bodies. In March, 1949, however, the Minister of Health reconsidered the application of this particular section of the National Assistance Act, and decided that Hospital Committees and Boards should arrange and pay for the burial or cremation of patients dying in hospitals under the following circumstances:– (a) Relatives not being traced; (b) Relatives being traced, but who were not, immediately before a patient's death, liable to his (or her) maintenance under Section 42(1) of the Act, and are not willing to undertake the arrangement of burial or cremation; and (c) Relatives not being able to obtain a death grant under the National Insurance Act, 1946, and unable to accept financial responsibility for burial or cremation expenses. This decision by the Minister of Health greatly eased the financial burden on the Council in a direct sense, for in 1949 and 1950 this authority was only called upon to arrange interments in 25 and 9 instances respectively. Responsibility for the interment or cremation of the great majority of persons who die in hospital is, therefore, not falling upon the local authority, as will be evident from the figures given above0 This Council deals with such cases as may be referred to them by hospital authorities owing to the failure of liable relatives to assume their responsibilities, whilst the necessary arrangements are made in respect of persons dying in their own homes, when it is obvious that exhaustive enquiries have proved of no avail. Section 50(4.) of the Act provides that "an authority may recover from the estate of the deoeased person or from any other person who for the purposes of this Act was liable to maintain the deceased person immediately before his (or her) death, expenses incurred". Generally speaking, it has been found that the estates of deceased persons whose burials have become the responsibility of the Council, are negligible in value. During 1951, the Public Health Department, in accordance with the terms of an annual contract with a local undertaker, arranged the following interments:– Adults 8 Children 1 Stillborn 1 51 WELFARE OF (LP PEOPLE A keen interest is shown by the Borough Council in the lives of old people, and many and varied services are available to them0 In many instances -those concerned much prefer, despite infirmity, to continue to live in their own homes; in such cases the Council's social worker and helpers from various voluntary bodies are able to greatly improve the lot of aged people by informal and regular visiting, the provision and delivery of hot meals on four days in each week, arranging the supply of library books, and attending to other personal needs, whilst every endeavour is made to obviate any feeling of "assistance" that might existo To further this work the Borough Council makes an annual grant of £350 to an Old People's Committee. At the present time 613 persons are on the Council's register. In 1950, only 106 cases were being considered, but 507 were added during last year, when a survey was carried out of a block of flats managed by a Trust, and with the assistance of the Superintendent thereof it was ascertained that of ihe total population of 1,514, some 514- were eligible to receive the services under consideration. The following short summaries will give some impression of ihe work undertaken Hot Meals. This service operates daily from Monday to Thursday in each week, and has steadily grown in popularity, and the average.weekly distribution has risen from 150 to 220, which latter figure is the maximum attainable at the present time,, Much of the grant mentioned above is expended under this headingo Chiropody. The services of a qualified chiropodist are greatly appreciated, and 228 treatments were given during the year to 34 persons, of whom 28 were regularly attended in their own homes. A fee of two shillings per visit is paid by the patients. Holidays. 75 people were able to enjoy holidays in the country or at the seaside, returning to their own homes greatly benefitted. Transport was provided voluntarily by the owners of private cars. Visiting and Shopping. Members of the British Red Cross Society are regularly visiting 38 old people, and also escort them when they have to attend at the out-patients' departments of various hospitals. At other times they help with shopping and the collection of pensions where it is not possible for those concerned to leave their homes. Library. The British Red Cross Society also operate a regular visiting library which is much appreciated. At the present time, thirty aged persons take advantage of this facility. Wheelchairs for both indoor and outdoor use are available, free of charge, all the year round. 52 Clothing . Dud to the kindness of numerous donors and also by application to the Women's Voluntary Services, it was possible to provide some warm clothing to 141 persons, whilst in 34 instances, warm bedding was allocated, and in most cases, new beds. These facilities were generally forthcoming as a result of grants made by the National Assistance Board. Hospitals. It is veiydifficult to secure hospital accomodation, but the good relationship which exists between all concerned made it possible for thirty-nine old people to be admitted to hospitals during the year, many of whom later returned to their homes and resumed a normal life. Institutional Treatment. During the period under review it was necessary to arrange for twenty cases to be admitted to institutions because they were unable to give themselves proper care and attention, and it is gratifying to record that all adjusted themselves to a communal life. However, it must be stressed that in some cases, considerable tact and patience is necessary before agreement is secured and arrangements can be made for such treatment. 53 SUMMARY OF SERVICES PROVIDED FOR AGED AND INFIRM PERSONS DURING THE YEAR 1951 Cases New Old BEDDING 19 15 Cleansing: (a) Personal – 1 (b) Erfects 2 1 (c) Rooms 2 1 cHIROPODY 48 180 Clothing 35 106 Club FAcilitIES 20 12 Convalescence – 4 Dental Treatment – 2 dOMASTIC equipments 15 17 Domestic Help 46 23 Financial Assistance 17 26 Food parcel Issues 16 139 Furniture Issues 7 25 General Practitioners, Contact with 64 212 Hospital Treatment 13 26 Housing, Applications for 1 12 Housing Defects, Action re 2 2 Home Nursing 26 26 Holidays 22 53 Institutional Care through London County Council 8 12 Library 19 5 Meals, Provision of 126 8,906 Ophthalmic Treatment – 7 Pensions, Main and Supplementary 30 22 Recreational Facilities 22 141 Shopping 6 18 Sickroom EQuipment 10 21 Visiting 907 797 TOTALS: 1,083 10,812 54 METEOROLOGY - 1951 The following table gives details of certain meteorological observations made during each quarter of the year, and has been prepared from information supplied by the Director of the Meteorological Office, based on data obtained at Kew Observatory.

General precipitation expressed in percentages of the averages for southeastern districts of the country was as followst- January- 150; February - 300 j March - 175. As regards sunshine, 91 per cent of the average was recorded. The June quarter did not open auspiciously, rainfall being well above average in both April and May. April was, however, quite sunny. The month of June brought about a great improvement there being only a little over half of the anticipated rainfall, whilst abundant sunshine was enjoyed. "Generally unsettled" is expressive of the •weather during the SEPTEMBER quarter. July was rather warm and sunny, and the greater part of the rainfall was attributed to thundery outbreaks. August and September were conspicuous for the absence of warm days and the occurrence of heavy rainfalls. Apart firotfl exceptionally wet and mild weather in November, the DECEMBER quarter was dry and sunny, both October and December markedly exceeding the expectation of sunshine. METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF fflELSKA Annual Report of the PUBLIC ANALYST for the year ended 31st December, 1951? by THOMAS McLAGHLAN, A.C.G,F.C„, F.R.I.C. Public Analysto 56 To the Mayor? Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea. Madam Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, During the year 1951, 400 samples of foods and drugs vere examined under the Food and Drugs Act. Of these, 213 were taken formally, and 187 informally. The number adulterated or incorrectly labelled vas 18, or 4.5 per cent. Ho sample of milk examined during the year was found to be adulterated. The incidence of adulteration may be classified as follows:– Number of samples examined Peroentage adulteration Chemical Labelling Milk 197 0% 0% Other Foods 188 6.9% 1.6% Drugs 15 0% 13.0% Two samples of Ice Cream vere reported as adulterated. One contained only 2.78 per cent of fat and vas 44 per cent deficient in fat; the other contained 4.33 per oent of fat and was 14 per oent deficient. The Food Standards Ice Cream Order, 1951, required Ice Cream to contain not less than 5 per oent of fat. Some uncooked potato slices used for potato crisps were received and reported as adulterated because they contained traces of sulphur dioxide. Tour Analyst considered that -the prooedure of bleaching the unoooked potato slices with sulphur dioxide was theoretically illegal, but as the Ministry of Food had approved prooesses of this type, no exoeption could be taken by a Local Authority. A sample of sugar was found to be contaminated with floor sweepings, and it vas thought that the sugar had been spilt on to the floor of a shop and svept .up, but it was not possible to express a definite opinion as to hov the dirt had originated. Later your Analyst's suspicions vere found to have been correot. A sample of Mushroom Ketohup vas reported as inferior because the label did not state the ingredients, although the Ketchup vas satisfactory. Pickles and Sauoes oome under the Labelling of Food Order, and the labels must bear a notioe stating vhat are the ingredients, but this bottle may have been old stock. A sample of Cooonut in Syrup vas reported as inferior as the syrup contained only 18.4 per oent of sugar. It is difficult to state exactly hov much sugar must be present to varrant the use of the term "syrup'', but as coconut oontains approximately 8 per cent of sugar a very mild sugar solution only could have been employed for the canning of this preparation, and the description "syrup" vas certainly not varranted. 57 A sample of Sandwich Spread submitted had an unsatisfactory taste, and a bacteriological examination revealed the presence of several hundred thousand bacteria per gramme. It was, therefore, suggested that a sample should be purchased and sent to the Council's bacteriologist. This further sample contained very few bacteria, but your Inspector was informed at the shop that the manufacturers had informed them that as the particular batch from which the first sample had been obtained was out of date, the sale had been stopped. The results obtained by your Analyst would, therefore, appear to have been in accordance with those of the manufacturers. A sample of Ready Mix Custard Powder was reported as inferior as it contained edible oil instead of butter fat. Some Chocolate Powder was described as a mixture of pure cocoas and sugar, but as it contained 60 per cent, of sugar and only 40 per cent, cocoa matter, the declared composition must be sugar and pure cocoa. This sample contravened the Labelling of Food Order. The label on a tin of Health Salts also contravened the Labelling of Food Order as it failed to state all the ingredients, but showed 40 per cent, other constituents". Four samples of Semolina were reported as Adulterated as your Analyst considered they were too finely ground - from 96.12 per cent to 100 per cent passing a 40 mesh sieve. The public expects a semolina which is more nearly the size of seed tapioca, and not more than 40 per oent. should pass a 40 mesh sieve. It has unfortunately not been possible to obtain co-operation on this point either from the semolina millers or from the Ministry of Food. A sample of Honey was examined and found to contain invert sugar as well as honey. An examination carried out by the local public analyst in the neighbourhood where the honey was produced showed that the presence of invert sugar was due to the artificial feeding of the bees. Hie sale of the product was, therefore, permitted to continue, but it should be borne in mind by bee-keepers that honey should really be collected from plants and not merely transferred from a sugar store. A sample of Beef Extract was examined and found to be mouldy, but enquiry showed that it was very old stock, and that its manufacture had been discontinue for some four years. A sample of Wine was received which was stated to have been sold under a well-known "Chateau" description. On examination the wine was found to possess sin stroma more acrid and vinegary and a flavour definitely more vinegary than that of the genuine wine. The wine was cloudy and did not decant readily? whereas the genuine product decants readily from the bottle.
