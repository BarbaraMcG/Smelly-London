January, 1940. TO THE WORSHIPFUL THE PORT OF LONDON HEALTH COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health of the Port of London. Circular 1937 of the Ministry of Health dated 11th January, 1940, requests that "having regard to the desirability of reducing the number of records to be kept and of avoiding as far as possible the disclosure of information relating to the movements of ships, the Minister desires that the requirements set out in Memo.204-/S.A. shall be modified during the period of emergency: the letterpress of the report should consist of short notes on any points of special interest". During the year 1 ,470 vessels were boarded and inspected by your Medical officers and 11,417 by your Inspectors. Infectious Disease was reported as having occurred during the voyage on 233 vessels, the total number of cases being 383, of which 216 were landed in the Port. The following cases of infectious disease occurred in the Training Ships moored in the River:- Chickenpox 5; Scarlet Fever 7; Measles 9; Diphtheria 1 and Mumps 11. Three cases of Diphtheria occurred on a Houseboat moored in the district. One hundred and seven cases, particulars of which are given in Appendix II, were admitted to your Hospital at Denton. No case of human plague occurred during the year on any vessel bound for London. Of the 2,099 rats examined bacteriologically, 790 were from ships and 1,309 were from shore premises. No rats were reported to be infected with Plague. The Parrots (Prohibition of Import) Regulations, 1930, continued in operation and the work done thereunder is reported on page 9. Ninety vessels were fumigated for rat destruction under the supervision of your Inspectors; 33 by sulphur dioxide resulting in the destruction of 501 rats and 32 mice; 56 by hydrogen cyanide accounting for 64-3 rats and 527 mice and 1 by a combination of both hydrogen cyanide and sulphur dioxide resulting in the destruction of 39 rats, a total of 1,74-2 rodents. In addition 1,750 rats were trapped in ships and 4, 164 on shore in the port. Intimation Notices were served in respect of 52 cases 5. of infringement of the Bye-laws relating to Offensive Cargoes. Nuisances from smoke were reported in 7 vessels. The arrangements whereby the registration of Water Barges was made conditional upon the report of your Officers as to their fitness for the carriage of drinking water, continued to work smoothly. No action of any importance was taken to apply the existing Houseboat Bye-laws to the houseboats coming within the jurisdiction of the Port Health Authority, for the reason that the Bye-laws are under revision and new draft Bye-laws are in course of preparation. During the year 4,641 tons of foodstuffs were condemned as unfit for human consumption and were either destroyed or disposed of for animal feeding or industrial purposes under suitable guarantees. During the year Legal proceedings were instituted by the City Solicitor for a contravention of the Order dated 23rd April 1936, made by your worshipful Committee under the Public Health (Shellfish) Regulations, 1934; the defendant pleaded guilty. The case was dismissed under the First Offenders Act but the Magistrates issued a warning that any further case of this nature would be regarded most seriously and to that and they desired that full publicity should be given to the dangers of the sale, exposure or distribution or offer for sale or possession for the purpose of sale for human consumption, of shellfish from prohibited areas. No complaints were received during the year on the pollution of the River by sewage discharged from the Northern and Southern Outfalls. The year 1939 was marked by a gradual but rapid change in the organisation of the Port Health Service to meet the eventual outbreak of hostilities. Consequently the Port Health Service found itself, in a large measure, prepared on the declaration of war on September 3rd. The war-time organisation has necessitated additional and ofttimes heavy burdens on the staff and I have the honour to record that all grades have carried out their duties in an entirely satisfactory manner and in the very best spirit. The work of so large a port could not be carried out efficiently without the co-operation of the Officers of His Majesty's Customs and of the Port of London Authority, the Pilots and the Members of the Staffs of the Shipping Companies and Merchants, whose assistance and courtesy are gratefully acknowledged. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, M.T.MORGAN. 6. I.- AMOUNT OF SHIPPING ENTERING THE PORT DURING THE YEAR 1939 Table A.
