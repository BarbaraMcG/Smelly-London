In September, 1863, the Surrey Consumers' Gas Company entered into a contract to supply gas tor lighting the public lamps of this Parish for seven years, at £4 10s. 0d. per lamp per annum, being a reduction in price upon the old contract of live shillings per lamp per annum. 13 Watering, The Vestry still continue to contract with Messrs.

The old Plough Bridge having been condemned as dangerous by the Commissioners of Police, and a Magistrate's Order obtained for its demolition, it was resolved at a Meeting of the joint Committees of the Trustees of the Roads, the Commercial Dock Company, the Grand Surrey Dock-, and Canal Company, and this Vestry, that the Bridge should be taken down and a new iron bridge, forty feet wide, be constructed in lieu thereof. The cost of rebuilding the Bridge was roughly estimated at £1200, which it was agreed should be apportioned as follows, viz.— the grand Surrey Docks and Canal Company, to pay £200, and to give sufficient land to allow of the new bridge being built forty feet wide, on condition, however, that in future the Company should be relieved of the repair and maintenance of the Bridge. The trustees of the Roads likewise agreed to contribute a sum not exceeding £333 6s. 8d., and the Commercial Dock Company the sum of £300 towards the expenses of erecting a new Bridge. It was further agreed that the Vestry should carry out the works and apply to the Metropolitan Board of Works for a contribution in respect of the improvements in the roadway, and the Metropolitan Board of Works consented to contribute £233 6s. 8d. towards the cost of the bridge. The work was tendered for, and the Vestry ultimately entered into a contract with Messrs. Aird and Son for the erection of an iron girder bridge, forty feet wide, upon brick piers, for the sum of £1325. The works were immediately proceeded with, but in consquenee of the unsatisfactory nature of the ground, extra care, labour and material had to be used in constructing the foundations of the piers, which will add to the cost of the works. The bridge has been completed and opened for traffic and the approaches thereto widened and improved. Messrs. Cowan having applied for permission to bring out the front wall of their new Mill, Church passage, and Mr. Hill having also applied to bring out his adjoining shop in a line therewith so as to do away with an angle in the footway at that spot which was likely to become a nuisance. The Vestry granted their applications upon condition that they should build upon or effectually fence in the ground so as it should not hereafter become a nuisance to the public. In consequence of a suggestion made at the General Meeting of Parishioners for the election of Vestrymen and Auditors in May, 1863, the Vestry caused Counsel's opinion to be taken upon the question whether under the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 19th and 20th vic., cap, 112, the Church wardens of this Parish were to be appointed by the Parishioners in open Vestry, as it had been done previously to the passing of the Act, or whether section 3, vested that power in the Vestry constituted under the Act 18th and 19th \ ic., cap. 120. The opinion of Mr. Lush.Q.C., was accordingly taken, and the following is a copy thereof: " 1 am of opinion that the power of appointing Churchwardens is transferred to and belong exclusively to the new Vestry constituted under the 18th and 19th Vic., c. 120, but that the making of Church Rates remains as it was before, with the open common law Vestry of the Parish." The Grand'Surrey Dock and Canal Company have abandoned all their Appeals against the Paving and Lighting Rates of this Pariah. 16 A Memorial having been received from the Inhabitants of Russell-street and that neighbourhood, complaining of the annoyance and nuisance experienced by them in consequence of certain houses in Russell-street being kept as brothels and disorderly houses, the Churchwardens and Overseers, at the request of the Vestry, caused Indictments to be preferred at the Surrey Sessions against the Occupiers of Nos. 18,43, and 52, Russell-street, which resulted in the Occupiers of the houses Nos. 18, and43 being found guilty and, the former sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment, with hard labour, and the latter to 9 months imprisonment, with hard labour. The Occupier of No. 52, Russell-street removed out of the Parish, and he not appearing on the day appointed for the trial of the Indictment, his recognizances were estreated. These indictments have had the good effect of abating the nuisances and annoyances complained of by the inhabitants in that part of the Parish." Notwithstanding the opposition of the City of London, and the several parishes on the south side of the Thames, the Authorities of St. Thomas's Hospital obtained the decision of Vicechancellor Sir Page Wood in favour of the Stangate site for the new Hospital. The Vestry set apart a sum not exceeding £50 towards the expenses that might be incurred in opposing the removal of the Hospital to Stangate, of which the sum of £29 13s. 11d. only has been expended. In November last the Vestry received Parliamentary Notices from the promoters of the following Railway and other schemes affecting property in this Parish, viz.—The East London Railway (Thames Tunnel Line), Metropolitan District Railways ; the Thames Tunnel Railway ; the Commercial and Grand Surrey Dock Amalgamation, and the Southwark Park. The Vestry presented Petitions against the East London Railway (Thames Tunnel Line), and the Commercial and Grand Surrey Docks Amalgamation Bills, to protect the interest of this Parish, and a Committee was appointed to watch the said Bills. The Commercial and Grand Surrey Docks Amalgamation Bill was apposed by Counsel in the Committee of the House of Lords, and ultimately clauses were inserted in the Act, providing for the better accommodation of the public at the Bridges over the entrances to the Grand Surrey Docks; also for regulating the opening and shutting of the said Bridges, and empowering the Vestry to recover a penalty for every offence, neglect, or omission, on the part of the Company in not complying with the provisions of the Act. The Bill has passed the Legislature as amended in Committee and embodying all the requirements of the Vestry. An arrangement was also made with the Promoters of the East London Railway (Thames Tunnel Line), for the adoption of an easier gradient in the incline of the approach to the proposed bridge to carry the Deptford Lower Road, and the Deptford Old Lower Road, at Westfield Terrace, over the said Railway; also for the insertion of clauses in the Act for the protection of the foot-paths and the Parochial Rates. This Bill has been lately thrown out by the Committee of the House of Commons. The portion of the line of the Metropolis District Railways, proposed to pass through this Parish, was abandoned on the recommendation of the Committee of the House of Lords, to whom the same was referred. The Thames Tunnel Railway Bill was not proceeded with, in consequence of the Promoters not having complied with the Parliamentary standing orders. The Act lor the formation of the Southwark Park in this Parish passed the Legislature, and the Metropolitan Board of Works (the authority authorized for that purpose) have resolved to cam' the same into effect without delay. 17 The site of the Park contains about 60 acres of land, and is bounded on the east by the Deptford Lower-road, on the south by the Rotherhithe New-road, on the west by Messrs Frosts' Rope Ground, Jamaica-level, and Jamaica-level, and on the north by the Gardens in the rear of the houses, Paradise-row. The Vestry presented a Petition to Parliament, praying for a Repeal of the Duty on Fire Insurances, and a Committee was appointed, and had an interview with John Locke, Esq., M.P., one of the Members for this Borough, on the subject A clock having been erected in the tower of Christ Church, by subscription, application was made to the Vestry to bear the cost of lighting the same with gas. This the Vestry agreed to do during the winter months, commencing on the 29th September, and ending on the 25th March, in each year. The Metropolitan Board of Works has ordered that the whole line of thoroughfare heretofore known by the names of Union-place, Mill Pond row, West-lane, and West-buildings in the respective parishes of Bermondsey and Rotherhithe, be called West-lane, and that the same be renumbered throughout, the odd numbers commencing from 1 and ending with 45 being assigned to the houses on the west or Bcrmondsey side, and the even numbers commencing from 2 and ending with 64 to those on the east or Rotherhithe side, such numIters to commence at the southern end. The Metropolitan Board of Works has sanctioned the formation of the following new streets in the Parish, viz..— Four new streets, each 40 feet wide, on land southward of the Rotherhithe New-road, and abutting upon Manor-row. Two new streets, each 40 feet wide, to be called respectively Hawthorne-road and Bushroad, on the site of the Cricket Field, Deptford Old-road, and Medway-place. One new street, 40 feet wide, to lead from Dodd's-place to Clarence-place; and Two new streets, each 40 feet wide, Jamaica-level, one to be called Hickling-street, the other has no name appropriated to it at present. APPENDIX No. I. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, From 25th March, 1863, to 25th March, 1864. To the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, Surrey. Gentlemen, I have the honour to lay before you a table of the cauaes of death in Rotherhithe during the e1apsed year namely, from March 25th,1863,to March 25th, 1864, and to present you with a report of the Sanitary work done during that period. 18 The fact upon which all calculations relating to the mortality of any place must necessarily be based is population; now the population of this Parish, according to the rate of increase from 1851 to 1861, when the Census was taken, ought to be 26,512 souls, or in round numbers 26,500, which I believe to be nearly correct. Eight hundred and eighty-one children, 434 males, and 447 females, were born during the elapsed year, giving a small fraction more than 33 births for every 1,000 inhabitants, which is about the average all over Great Britain, and an increase of 22 births on the year preceding, the increase of births being exactly proportioned to the supposed increase of population. There were registered 664 deaths, namely: 354 males and 310 females. This representation of the mortality is not, however, perfectly correct, because it is erroneous to include in the mortality the deaths of 17 persons upon whose bodies inquests were held, and who, not belonging to the place, were found dead in it or washed ashore from the Thames. These 17 deducted from 664 leave 647, upon which number our calculations must be made. There died, then, last year in Rotherhithe, about 24 persons in the 1,000, which is a little above the average death rate of the whole of London in previous years. This increase may be explained by the fact that this Parish, in common with almost every other metropolitan Parish, was visited last year by two epidemic diseases, viz.: the small pox and typhoid fever. Small pox broke out early in the year 1863, and during the spring and summer months spread itself in this locality. The alarm excited in the public mind by its appearance caused every human effort to be made to stay its progress, and apparently with some success. The children in all the public schools were examined and either vaccinated or re vaccinated, and hundreds of other children and adults underwent the same operation. The disease gradually died away in the winter, still, however, a solitary case of small pox occasionally shows itself. Typhoid fever, which had been nearly absent from the neighbourhood for some years, and very rarely manifested itself sporadically among us, gave signs of its presence in the year 1862, during which year (25th March, 1862, to 25th March, 1863) 16 deaths were registered from that malady. In the months of April and May, 1863, it attacked the inmates of the miserable tenements in Fisher's-court. It travelled thence to Hanover-street, New-place, Cross-alley, Kenning's-buildings, Eve's place, Adam's-gardens, Staples-rents, William-street, and other places. The only parts of the Parish which seem to have been free, or nearly free, from the complaint, were the line of Rotherhithe-street along the waterside, Paradise-row, and the Deptford Lower-road. I have no means of ascertaining the relative population of the eastern and western divisions of Rotherhithe, but certainly the cases of fever were far more numerous in the western than in the eastern district, the proportion being about 1 in the eastern for 9 in the western. This may be, to a certain extent, explained by the more crowded state of the western district, and by the fact that above 200 acres of the eastern, occupied by the Surrey and Commercial Docks, are open space, allowing free circulation of the air, which must be conducive to the healthfulness of any place. It would not be proper here to attempt to discuss whether typhus and typhoid fever be the same disease or perfectly distinct in their nature and origin, as some have asserted, but it is quite true that the two maladies often showed themselves simultaneously among the inmates of the same house, and sometimes among members of the same family. 19 The Parish Authorities, throughout the trying circumstances of these visitations of disease, acted with energy and humanity. Every means was used to stop their progress. The Board of Guardians supplied liberally comforts, and even luxuries, to the sufferers, some were attended at their homes, and others sent to the Fever Hospital. Nor was the Local Board of Health idle, the cleansing and scavenging of the various streets was everywhere carefully attended to. Summonses were taken out against the owners of houses who would not effect such improvements as the Sanitary Officers thought necessary. Every house in Fisher s-court and Cross-alley was cleansed and whitewashed, in New-place the drains were cleared; in Hanover-street dust bins were built, the water receptacles repaired or renewed, and, above all, the overcrowding of the houses was discontinued. There was, however, and is still, one thing wanted, which, alas! Sanitary Boards and Sanitary Officers cannot communicate, I mean habits of order and cleanliness among the people. Let us hope, however, that the day will come when the humbler classes of society will be well educated enough to know that cleanliness and attention to the decencies of life bring not only comfort and health, but also improved morals in their train. I shall consider, as I did last year, the table of mortality appended to this Report in regard to the seasons, the ages of the persons who died, and the diseases to which they succumbed. The most unhealthy period was the summer quarter from June 24th to September 29th, 1863, when 191 deaths were recorded. The number of deaths in the other quarters were nearly equal, being 152 from March 25th to June 24th, 1863, 159 from September 29th to December 25th, 1863, and 162 from December 25th, 1863, to March 25tli 1864. In respect of age 205 deaths, or less than a third of the whole number, were of children under 2 years, and 85 were between 2 and 5 years, making together, 290, or considerably less than half the mortality. A glance at the annexed tabular arrangement will give a good idea of the fatality of different diseases at different ages of life. The Zymotic diseases destroyed 179 persons, viz.: 79 died from fever, 23 from smallpox, 46 from scarlatina, 18 from whooping cough, 6 from measles, 18 from diarrhoea, 2 from cholera, and 1 from diphtheria; 45 deaths were registered from natural decay, 6 between 60 and 70 years, 17 between 70 and 80, 21 between 80 and 90, and 1 between 90 and 100. The last was of a man aged 99 years 11 months and some days. He followed actively his calling a« s chimney sweep till within about 3 weeks of his death. • Let us now pass to the Sanitary work done. During the elapsed year 166 nuisance notices were served, the drainage of 187 houses was completed, and 1,595 feet of pijie sewer and drains added to those already existing. Fifty-four summonses were issued, one against a wharfinger for storing and kiln-drying damaged grain, one against a coal tar distiller, 50 against an owner of property for allowing his houses to be overcrowded and not attending to their Sanitary arrangements, and 2 against a fish manure maker at the China Hall Gate. This last manufacturer was afterwards indicted at the Old Bailey. In the meanwhile his premises at the China Hall Gate were incorporated into those of the Grand Surrey Dock Company. and he transferred his business to the Atlas Works Jamaica-level. This Board then consented to stay the proceedings on condition that he, the manufacturer, should erect proper buildings for storing the ingredients used in the manufacture of fish manure, and also the 20 manure itself, and that he should put up efficient machinery, so that all gases generated in the factory should pass through a fire and be burnt before escaping into the atmosphere. This he has since done. (See Monthly Reports). At Messrs. Miller and Johnson's, Manure Makers, Rotherhithe-street, the shaft has been raised, and the smells arising from the factory thereby much diminished. At the Globe Wharf, which has been much complained of, the manufacturer has promised to use every practicable means to abate the nuisance, and has set about it by consulting at once the Surveyor of this Board. The cowhouses and slaughterhouses have been inspected as usual, no complaint has ever been made against these places, and I believe them to be well conducted. Thirty-three bakehouses in Rotherhithe have also been personally visited by me, and I must say that I was everywhere received by the bakers with kindness and courtesy. The bakehouses in Rotherhithe are, as a rule, clean and well appointed. The master bakers generally eulogising the recent Act of Parliament relative to the regulation of bakehouses, and often describing in no measured terms the dens in which they had been obliged to work when journeymen, or in the days of their apprenticeship. The Petroleum Works at the back of the Noah's Ark have been discontinued, the premises having been taken by the Commercial Dock Company. The Water supplied to Rotherhithe is of good quality. Complaints, however, have often been made to me by inhabitants of some of the new streets branching off from the Deptfordroad of scantiness of supply for several days consecutively. The scavenger work has been better done than during the preceding year. The Black Ditch, or Earle Sewer, and the Surrey Mill Stream, than which there are not two more disgraceful receptacles of filth in all London, still continue in the same state as heretofore. It is refreshing to turn from these streams of putrefaction to the park which is about to be formed in Rotherhithe. The inhabitants are already enjoying in anticipation its green turf, pleasant avenues, shady walks, and cooling water jets. We must all congratulate ourselves upon this coming event, which will not only afford to the people a place of innocent recreation, but tend also much to improve the healthfulness of the Parish. I shall conclude by expressing my cordial thanks to the Vestry and its Officers. Yours respectfully, W.
