In laying before the Ratepayers, whom they have the honour to represent, a report of their proceedings during the year, which ended on the 25th March, 1867, the Vestry cannot do better than refer to the Annual Report of their Surveyor, which is appended hereto. It contains the detailed particulars of the paving and sewerage works undertaken and carried out, which it is hoped will be deemed a satisfactory instalment of those operations, which have for their end and aim the health and comfort of the parishioners; but, on account of the expence involved, can only bo gradually accomplished. It must be a satisfaction to those who reside in the Hamlet, to know that great progress has been made towards the complete drainage of the district, and that there are but few houses which are not within an available distance of a sewer. The streets which have been adopted by the Parochial Authorities are almost all paved, and those, which, through the neglect of owners of property, have not been brought under the control of the Vestry, are being, from time to time, as circumstances permit, put into proper order at the expence of the persons upon whom the law justly imposes the burden. 8 The abolition of tolls on the Mile End Road, which took place at the end of last October, has been an event of some importance in the history of the parish. It was no doubt insisted on by public opinion, but it has materially added to the expenditure and duties of the Vestry. Rendering due justice to the late trustees of the Middlesex and Essex turnpike roads, for the condition in which they left this important thoroughfare, the Yestry still believe that the public will not suffer from its having passed under their control. The sanitary condition of the Hamlet engaged much of the attention of the Yestry throughout the year. The outbreak of Cholera in the summer of 1866, imposed upon them much additional labour and anxiety. The regulations issued by Her Majesty's Privy Council on the subject of that fearful visitation, were duly enforced, and for many weeks a numerous committee, specially charged with the duty of carrying them out, met for deliberation and action almost daily. The steps taken to stamp out the disease, and for the treatment of the sufferers, will be found in full detail in the Special Reports of the Medical Officer of Health and Surveyor, published during the Autumn of last year. The expenditure incurred by the Vestry in carrying out the regulations of the Privy Council amounted to £1145 2s. 7d. This was a large addition to the burdens of the Hamlet, but the Yestry were able to keep the rates within their ordinary limits. The vigilance of the Special Committee appointed to enforce the sanitary law within the district during the prevalence of Cholera, brought to light many defects in drainage, and other arrangements, on which the 9 public health depends, which had previously eluded discovery ; and they found it necessary to engage, for a limited time, several assistant inspectors of nuisances, who made a house to house visitation, and reported fully upon all sanitary defects which were found. The expense thus incurred was amply compensated by the results produced, in the suppression of nuisances and the removal of causes which tended to spread disease. The following list of sanitary measures, adopted during the year, in pursuance of orders of the Yestry, will confirm this statement: Cesspools abolished 976 Houses and premises connected with sewers 1097 Houses to which water laid on 457 Foul drains cleansed 421 Accumulations of dung and refuse removed 96 Traps provided for drains, closets, &c 1320 Premises from which pigs were removed 54 Houses cleansed and purified 237 The spread of Cholera throughout the Eastern parts of London, and its almost complete isolation within that area, coupled with the alarm given by the reports of the Registrar General, impressed the Yestry with the necessity of adopting proper steps for securing to the East End of London an adequate supply of wholesome water ; and they therefore took the initiative by convening a meeting of the members of all the Vestries and Boards of Works within the Tower Hamlets. The result was that a committee was formed, in which those local authorities were represented, to take the question of water supply into consideration. From various causes the committee found it impracticable to obtain special legislation, but, by fixing public attention upon the question, they had considerable B 10 weight in inducing the Government to institute enquiries on the subject, and the East London Waterworks Company to seek from Parliament for enlarged and beneficial powers. The duties of the Vestry, which recur from year to year, have not been neglected. The condition of cow-houses, slaughter-houses and bake-houses has been duly supervised, and the necessary steps have, from time to time, been taken, to secure the due observance of sanitary requirements. In October last, 32 licenses for slaughter-houses, and 27 licenses for cow-houses were granted by the Justices. The annual contract for the removal of dust from houses was duly entered into. The accounts for the year ending 25th March, 1866, were in due course submitted to the auditors, vouched and allowed. The abstract of the accounts, showing the receipts and expenditure of the Yestry, with their assets and liabilities, is appended to this Report. Vestry Hall, Bancroft Road. 29th June, 1867.

Auditors REPORT OF THE SURVEYOR TO THE VESTRY or THE Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. REPORT. June, 1867. Gentlemen, It is with much pleasure that I again place before you a statement of the various works carried out in my department for the year ending March 25th: Paving. The quantity of 355,800 feet superficial of 2½ inch paving have been laid during the past year 20,800 feet of which have been laid by Mr. Druitt under contract, and 15,000 by your own workmen. A large quantity has been used for paving the footways abutting on the flank walls of houses, and is spread nearly equally throughout every Ward in the Hamlet. Park Road and Edinboro2 Road have also been paved. 4 Carriageway Paving. The Vestry have purchased of Messrs. Hill and Keddle about 2000 tons of second hand pitching from the Holborn Valley; but, owing to the works of the Corporation of the City not proceeding as rapidly as was anticipated, we have up to the present time only received 840 tons. This has been laid in Devonshire Street, Globe Road, and Hayfield Passage. New Streets. During the year you have made up and taken to Calverley Street, Floriston Street, Copley Street, Carlton Road, and Wentworth Road. The footways of the streets have also been paved. The whole of the works, with the exception of Copley Street, have been performed at the expense of the owners of property situate in such streets. I append a tabular statement shewing the cost of labour, scavenging, and horse hire, for the year ending 25th March, 1867, also the quantity of materials used during the year: ROAD MATERIALS.

On the 1st of November last the Act of Parliament authorizing the Trustees of the Middlesex and Essex Turnpike Roads to levy tolls terminated, and the maintenance of the road as a highway devolved upon the various parishes through which it passed. The boundary of this Hamlet in the Mile End Road to the west is at Cannon Place, the eastern boundary of the Hamlet is at the City of London Union, opposite the centre of Coborn Road. The whole length of this portion of the road has been cleansed, lighted, and ropaired by you. I find that the line of road extending from our eastern boundary, near the "Moor's Arms," Bow Common, along the Old Road, Bull Lane, Diamond Row, Smith Street, North Street, Epping Place, Raven Row, and Cannon Place, which formerly was largely used by persons for the purpose of avoiding the toll, is now comparatively unused, and consequently this long line of thoroughfare which has hitherto been very costly for maintenance, has, since the abolition of the tolls, ceased to be more used than any of the other ordinary roads of the Hamlet. I cannot at this moment give you the difference of cost of maintence of these roads as compared with last year, sufficient time not having expired, but on a future occasion propose to do so. While on this matter I would wish to observe that at the expiration of the Act, a large balance remained in the hands of the Trustees, a large portion of which was, by the judicious management of the Trustees, who were inhabitants of this Hamlet, with Mr. E. L. Johnson at their head, expended in laying down pitchings in various parts of the Mile End Road in this Hamlet, effecting a saving to the ratepayers of over a thousand pounds. 8 I think the alteration made in the Mile End Road which I have spoken of has given satisfaction to the inhabitants of the vicinity. "Watering. During the summer season the water carts were employed on 67 days, and cost the sum of £455 10s. for horses and men, and the sum of £174 15s. 9d. for water supplied by the East London Water Works Company. As you have to perform the watering of the Mile End Road during this season you have had 5 new water carts constructed by Mr. Mansfield, making 16 carts now used by you. Lighting. The lighting of the Hamlet is still continued by the Commercial Gas Company, who light 729 lamps at a cost to the Vestry of £2933 6s. 2d. No complaint has originated during the past year of either the quantity or quality of the gas supplied. Sewers. During the past year sewers have been laid in Heath Street, Arbour Street East, Arbour Street West, Arbour Square, Rhodeswell Road, Jubilee Street, Albert Street, Albert Road, and Longnor Road. That portion of the work executed at the cost of the Vestry was performed by Mr. Finch and Mr. Ashby. The outlay to the Vestry for these works was £1439 13s. 6d. Fifteen new gullies have been constructed, and 135 old gullies trapped. There are still 300 gullies in the Hamlet which are untrapped. Much inconvenience is occurring from the small 9 flow of water in many of our sewers; large quantities of soil deposit in them instead of passing away to the outlet. The following will show the quantity of each description of sewer executed during the year: 3 feet 6 inches by 2 feet 3 inches 2,020 feet, 1 ,, 3 ,, 1 ,, 3 ,, 1,100 „ 1 „ 0 „ 1 „ 0 „ 2,435 ,, 9 „ 0 „ 0 „ 9 „ 1,972 „ 6 „ 0 „ 0 „ 6 „ 7,520 „ I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES KNIGHT. Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town REPORT OH THE SANITARY CONDITION & PUBLIC HEALTH OF Mile End Old Town for THE YEAR ENDING MARCH the 30th, 1867, BY MATTHEW CORNER, M.D., Officer of health LONDON Printed by T. Penny, 121, Leman Street, White chapel, E. 1867. REPORT. to the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Gentlemen, In this Report, I purpose to review briefly, the proceedings of the health department of the Vestry, during the year ending March, 1867 ; to notice the present sanitary condition of the Hamlet, and to make passing allusion to, or comments upon, any subject of interest to the public health. I have prepared tables in a way which I consider will give you, at a glance, a clear insight as to the births and deaths for the year, compared with previous years, and the relative rates of births and deaths compared with other places. I have prepared a special table for deaths from zymotic diseases, as it is by their variation, rise or fall, that we can best judge of the results produced by our sanitary measures. At each meeting of the Committee, I have presented and read Reports upon the current mortality and sanitary condition of the Hamlet, upon subjects continually arising of importance to the general health—such as nuisances dangerous to health, or supposed to be so, and upon numerous special matters, which it is neither necessary nor desirable, in all cases to particularize. I will only allude, in the course of this report, to those of greatest general interest. By the Report of the Inspector of Nuisances, appended to this, you will see 4 that an amount of work (comprising a total of 5603 orders issued and completed) unprecedented in anyprevious year, or probably number of years, has been effected in that department. Altogether, I think you will consider that a large amount of good work has been done, and if we may judge of its necessity and effects by the mortality from zymotic diseases, especially during the second half of the year, (Table III.), then all the sanitary measures have been fully justified, and their effects eminently satisfactory. It is not necessary that I should specially refer to the Cholera epidemic of last year, having already presented a special report thereon. Births and General Mortality. Table I. shows the total number of births and deaths for the year, with and without cholera, and for four preceding years. The births are above the average, though slightly lower than the year immediately preceding; the latter circumstance may be reasonably attributed to the epidemic of last year. The excess of births over deaths (including cholera) for the year ending March, 1867, was 809, and of 1488 over what would have been the normal mortality, in the absence of cholera. The birth rate upon the population of the Hamlet was 3.753 per cent.; the rate for the whole of England was 3.537 per cent., proving the birth rate of Mile End about one quarter per cent., higher than that for the whole country. In addition to this, the population of the Hamlet has been very largely and respectably increased by immigration, as shown by the occupation of vast numbers of new houses which have been built. All this proves what I have TABLE I. Births and Deaths in Mile End Old Town for the year ending March, 1867, and for Four previous years ending— BIRTHS. DEATHS.

Diarr. 679 Inclusive of Cholera. 2381 * From all causes except Cholera. The number of deaths from Cholera and Diarrhœa, includes those which occurred in the Hospital, and taken from Mile End but not registered as such, and to this extent all calculations, based upon the Registrar Generals returns, would appear erroneous. 6 often before repeated, that judicious expenditure in effective sanitary measures is returned with large interest, by salubrity and low rates, inevitably attracting better tenants and higher rents. To give a fair and clear idea of the mortality, it was necessary to distinguish the exceptional deaths from cholera, from those produced by all other causes; at the same time I have retained among the latter the deaths from the diarrhœa, usually prevalent at certain periods of the year. Thus we find the total ordinary mortality of last year was 135 below the average of the four preceding years. The unprecedentedly healthy condition of the Hamlet for the six months ending June last, has no doubt greatly contributed to the favourable result. It would be during this period that the sanitary measures previously initiated and carried out, would produce their beneficial effects. This must be very gratifying to the members of the Committee of the Vestry, through whom such measures were accomplished, as in all human probability the greatest of all good works was thereby achieved, that of preserving health and saving life. Table II. gives a comparison of the number of deaths from zymotic diseases during the whole year, and for four previous years. The number for the past year is 132 below the average for the four previous years; but to give a clearer idea of the mortality in the Hamlet from this class of diseases, I have prepared a table (III.) showing the death rate, per 1,000 living, from all causes, and zymotic diseases separately, in Mile End and the five Metropolitan districts. In both classes we contrast most favourably with the other districts, being much lower than all, except the west districts, which are only fractionally lower than Mile End. 7 TABLE II.

Table IV. shows the number of deaths at different ages, the period between birth and five years of age gives as usual an excessive and disproportionate numover all other periods. Popularly this result is accepted as a matter of course, the idea being that children must in some preordained or conventional way, have measles, whooping-cough or scarlatina, in obedience to laws as immutable as that by which they cut their teeth; in other words that the germs of these fatal diseases are congenital and born in the flesh; such views are, I believe, entirely fallacious; constitutional diseases, such as consumption, arising in an abnormal and defective condition of the integral constituents of the body are so inherited by the infant and afterwards developed into fatal disease; but that the specific and active blood poisons of the infantile diseases referred to, which incubate, develope and exhaust themselves in a few days, should remain dormant in the system for an indefinite period and then suddenly become active, is a theory quite untenable. I have been induced to make these observations owing to having been frequently asked whether these infantile diseases were not dependent upon natural and inevitable laws. I cannot, within the limits of a report of this kind, enter into a detailed discussion of such questions, but only allude to and express a passing opinion upon them in their relation to vital statistics, still it would not be justifiable to pass without special notice that portion which constitutes half the total mortality of the country. If it were possible to exclude and preserve children from the producing causes of infantile diseases by which they are surrounded directly they are born, they would TABLE IV.

When the diseases are not fatal they may leave behind them such a condition of the system as will be most damaging to the constitution of the future man probably for generations to come. Therefore, to elucidate and eradicate the causes of this class of infantile diseases is to strike at the roots of the greatest and most insidious enemies to health and life, and they are unquestionably amenable to preventive measures. 'Zymotic Diseases and Sanitary Measures. By Table II. it will be seen that the number of deaths during the year from preventible diseases was nearly one fourth the total mortality of the Hamlet. In all cases of zymotic diseases which have come under my notice, I have, when necessary, directed printed notices, under the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1866, to be sent, requiring the premises, or part thereof, to be thoroughly cleansed and disinfected. [See next page for copy of the order.] As will be seen by the Inspector's return, 107 such orders have been issued during a period of about six months. The Inspectors inform me that in nearly every instance the orders have been well carried out, and in only two or three instances have objections been made or opposition raised and referred to me, and in those cases a courteous explanation of the objects desired has been sufficient to cause a ready acquiesence therein. 11 HAMLET OF MILE END OLD TOWN. TO THE OCCUPIER of the House being in the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town, in the County of Middlesex. Infectious disease having occurred or at present existing in your house, you are required, under the Provisions of the Public Health Act of 1866, to forthwith have the rooms of such house thoroughly cleansed and disinfected. The ceilings and walls to be cleansed, and, where practicable, limewhited—the floors and other woodwork to be washed with water ANd chloride of lime or carbolate of lime—(when purchased, chloride of lime should be dry, and of a greyish white color). The bed clothes and linen of the patient, and all soiled articles, to be placed as speedily as possible in boiling water and there left until cold—all discharges from the patient must be immediately disinfected with "Burnett's Fluid," or "carbolic acid" and directly thrown away. The rooms and the house generally to be thoroughly ventilated as often as possible by open doors and windows. Where sickness is at the time in the house, the medical attendant should be consulted as to these measures of disinfection. If further instructions are required they can be obtained upon application at the Vestry Hall, Bancroft Road. Dated this day of 1867. By Order of the Vestry, HENRY LESHAAW, Sanitary Inspector. Vestry Hall, Bancroft Road, Mile End Road. I am fully aaware that owing to a prejudice felt by many against these measures resulting from ignorance of their value and objects, they must be carried into effect judiciously and with much tact and discretion; this course has always been my aim, to ensure that the sanitary measures are efficiently carried out, without at the same time creating opposition or annoyance to owner or occupier by unreasonable or impossible demands. I believe this system has been most effective 12 in. staying the progress of diseases by destroying their infectious properties in the places where they had become fixed. Recently in the West Ward of this Hamlet, where fever has been very prevalent for several months, I have observed many marked instances of the success of the course pursued, whereas in houses in which such measures had not been adopted the disease continued to extend. Overcrowding, Ventilation, &c. There can be no doubt that these diseases have their exciting causes, and their remote origin too, in the evils attendant upon overcrowding and uncleanliness producing specific blood poisoning, thus inflicting upon us a fatal penalty for ignoring the fundamental and even instinctive hygienic laws of nature. The most complete system of drainage and water supply with every other sanitary accessory would be rendered useless by a continuance and disregard of the evils referred to. Of course much may be done in mitigation by improved methods of ventilation, but in calm weather and in winter, when every means of ingress for air is cut off to retain necessary wamth, nothing short of a hurricane would suffice to displace and renew the air in the houses of the "built in" old courts and streets which exist in all large towns. With a belt of air 40 miles in depth surrounding the earth, surely it is the refinement of cruelty to restrict its supply within limits which we know to be not only injurious, but ruinous to the health and well-being of present and future generations. If the enormous supply of air above mentioned should ever prove insufficient, no doubt the credulity of the public would be equal, as is proposed in the case of water, to contribute the means 13 for a supply being brought from an indefinite distance, so there need be no fear on the ground of the Metropolitan supply of air becoming exhausted. We are most solicitous to avoid the consumption of unsound or adulterated food, which is consumed only at intervals, but the air we are incessantly breathing, is permitted to be consumed impure and poisoned in quality, and restricted and utterly deficient in quantity, although a pure and inexhaustible supply is provided for all. The effect of respiring this poisonous air is to produce prostration of the vital energies and want of power to resist the attacks of disease. A labouring man sleeping, or rather narcoticizing, with his wife and family in a room allowing from 50 to 150 cubic feet of air to each person, and without the most ordinary provision for ventilation, becomes totally unfitted for his work, and unable, however willing, to bring to his aid sufficient vigour and spirit to attempt to raise himself and family from their condition of poverty, misery and dependence. In this way the statistics of pauperism are increased, several instances of which, through the deaths of heads of families, I have already seen in this Hamlet. These questions of overcrowding, and consequent deficient and impure air supply, are therefore the most important subjects which I can urge, and it is my duty to do so, upon your consideration, as the legitimate and responsible guardians of the public health. Mile End is not an exception to all other large communities, in having densely packed populations and squalid poverty in certain localities, existence in which only proves the tenacity of human life under the most adverse and pernicious influences. The supply of air according to the space is often insufficient to sustain life for a single day, and but for 14 its adventitious and accidental ingress, sudden deaths would occur instead of being preceded by prolonged illness; indeed, doubtless many mysterious sudden deaths are attributable to this cause. These conditions, if they cannot be completely remedied, can, by earnest efforts, be largely ameliorated without injury to the interests of any and with great benefit to all. I am fully conscious of the difficulties in the way of a speedy and perfect remedy for these evils, but seeing that they are literally the cause of so much disease and death, I think we ought, so far as we may reasonably be expected, endeavour to mitigate them, and to this end we can do much. Legislation would be the most effectual, as it would be the most just means for dealing with a large question like this, and which it would be impossible for individuals to meet with more than partial success; moreover it is a condition for which they are not wholly responsible. It is impossible for an officer of health to ensure success for the means he employs to promote the health of a community under his charge, with such enemies as overcrowded and unhealthy dwellings to contend against, unless some means for the amelioration of such evils are within his reach; but I repeat that with earnest and sincere efforts, we can, even with the inadequate means now at our disposal, do much to mitigate the dangers of such conditions. Small-pox and Vaccination. In common with the rest of the Metropolis, indeed with the whole country, small-pox has been epidemic in the Hamlet, but has now almost entirely abated. 15 In the course of my enquiries I found there were a great number of unvaccinated children above one year of age, among whom the severity and fatality of the disease was much greater than in those who had been vaccinated. I found several instances of this clear evidence in favor of efficient vaccination, in the same families where sometimes all, and in others most of the members thereof were attacked with small pox, some mildly, others severely, and some fatally, the degree being influenced by previous vaccination or non-vaccination. I communicated with the Guardians recommending increased facilities for vaccination by establishing temporary vaccine stations in all the poorest districts, but in view of the impending legislation upon the subject, it was deemed better to defer any action until the result was known (see Report to the Committee.) By the kindness of the Guardians the patients' books of the Union Medical Officers are placed at my disposal, so that I can, at any time, ascertain if infectious disease is prevalent in any district of the Hamlet, and adopt measures accordingly. The number of new cases of all kinds attended by the Union Medical Officers during the thirteen weeks ending June 29th, 1807, were 2142, of these 478 were cases of zymotic diseases. Table V. shows the numbers of deaths from all causes in the Hamlet during the year ending March, 1867. Of the 349 deaths from ordinary zymotic diseases in the year ending March, 1867, 287 occurred in the same streets, places, &c., as those for the previous year, a list of which is appended to my Cholera Report of last year. TABLE V. Mortality from all causes during the year ending March 30th, 1867. CAUSES.

With regard to the water supply in the Hamlet it has been ample and the quality equal to, and often superior, to that of the other London companies, as shown by the frequent analyses of both Professors Letheby and Frankland. There have been a few complaints of deficient supply, but these have been satisfactorily attended to upon my application to the Company. The principal defect under the present intermittent system is the absence of a Sunday supply. This is more especially felt in some of the poorer districts, where the water is not turned on until late in the day on Mondays. This evil is greatly aggravated, and indeed mainly caused, by want of sufficient and proper receptacles for storage, the result being that a great excess more water is wasted than used. The essential and only satisfactory condition is a constant and pure supply—water, next to air, is Nature's greatest antiseptic and purifier. If all supplied was properly used, it would go far to destroy or prevent the evils produced by some of the causes already alluded to. The greater absence of impurity from the water of the East London Company has been shown by the periodical analyses but of course the public willnot submit to a continuance of the presentsewage contamination of the London waters any longer than will be required for the application of the means of prevention, and a constant and pure supply is the only allowable condition of surrender. Wherever practicable the Committee have ordered water waste preventers to be provided, this is tantamount to a constant supply. 18 New Dwelling Houses. I have reported upon the danger caused by building new houses upon ground or waste lands previously unprepared for the purpose. Many open places now built, or being built upon in this Hamlet, have been for years the receptacles for all kinds of animal and vegetable refuse, and have become thoroughly impregnated with the products of their decomposition, houses are built thereon, and the result to the health of the occupants may be imagined and is daily realized by the excessive numbers of zymotic diseases and deaths which occur in them. Such foundations should be properly prepared by previous drainage and other means, to prevent the exhalation of miasmata from the ground into the houses. My report to the Committee upon this subject was suggested when it was proposed to build houses upon some ground in East Street, for years used as the receptacle for all kinds of organic refuse. Finding there was no Act of Parliament containing any provision to prevent this evil, I sent a copy of my Report to the Building Act Committee of the Metropolitan Board. I may mention as interesting to residents of East London and all interested in saving Epping Forest from destruction, that similar objections apply to building dwelling houses upon recently cleared forest lands. Woods and forests are highly conducive to the health of inhabited districts for miles around, but once cleared the land gives forth its previously pent up pestiferous malaria, being transformed from a source of safety and protection to a focus of danger to health ; this consideration ought to have been sufficient to prevent any portion of the Forest being cleared, and should now check further progress in -such a course. 19 Another great source of the unhealthiness of large towns, consists in building long uninterrupted lines of houses and squares, in a way utterly regardless of the principles and influence of ventilation, the surrounding air being completely enclosed, and often hopelessly stagnant. Public institutions and large hospitals are very often unhealthy and dangerous to patients, from this cause. The London Hospital is an example of this system, and the mischief has been increased by the position of the new wing. Such buildings should be built in detached portions. Diseased Food and Adulteration. Several cases of dealing in unsound or diseased meat intended for human consumption have been discovered and the meat destroyed under the supervision of the Inspectors. In one instance the offender was also convicted in a penalty. There is no doubt much of this traffic going forward, but it is difficult to detect, owing to every means of deception and secrecy being practised. In addition to being a cruel robbery of the poor, it is a source of much illness among them, and the Vestry should insist upon the evil being suppressed to the utmost possible extent. Adulteration of food, though it may not be so directly injurious to health as diseased meat, still from the large scale upon which it is practised, must, in many instances, be seriously prejudicial. Local Boards have not yet adopted any definite system in regard to its prevention. To deal effectually with the subject would require considerable time and a somewhat elaborate machinery. I believe adulteration of food is much encouraged by the excessive demand for all articles included under the name of "luxuries," and to supply them in a pure state 20 is beyond all present productive power. This general custom of adulteration often explains the cause of many small and mysterious manufactories which we so frequently discover, where least expected, in crowded and obscure neighbourhoods. One of these little industries is very common, and consists in rendering all kinds of refuse, fat and dripping, the product of which, under the alterative influence of a voyage from Brewer's Quay, London, to Rotterdam and back, undergoes transmutation into Prime Dutch Butter. The "Presiding Genius" of this same Quay could make interesting revelations with respect to the chemistry of many articles of human food, both liquid and solid, producing an impression upon the mind of the very successful application to the science of human food of the ancient art of Alchemy. Cow and Slaughter Houses. Accompanied by the Inspector Iexamined the slaughter and cow houses in the Hamlet; the latter were 23 in number, containing, at that time, the very limited number of 253 animals. In my report to the Committee I stated that, with one exception, the cow-barns were totally unfitted for the purposes used. There is no ventilation where most required, near the heads of the animals; and owing to the places immediately abutting upon private grounds, yards, &c., this defect could not be remedied. The animals are, therefore, continually respiring a poisoned atmosphere, so that it is impossible for them to be healthy, and lung disease, rinderpest, etc., are the necessary results from the blood poisoning. Generally the places were kept clean, but many orders were issued for cleansing and improving the drainage (see report to Committee). 21 Of the slaughter-houses it is only necessary to say that, owing to restrictions imposed on account of the Cattle Plague, they were very little used, were clean, and well ventilated; some defects in drainage were ordered to be remedied. I have now placed before you the more important subjects which I have from time to time reported upon to the Committee, whose duties are so onerous in relation to the public health; and, I trust, from this report that the Vestry will be enabled to form a fair estimate of the sanitary condition and state of the public health in the Hamlet. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, M. CORNER, M.D., &c., Officer of Health for Mile End Old Town. Vestry Hall, July, 18G7.
