July, 1948. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Surbiton. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am presenting my 26th Annual Report to which is attached the Sanitary Inspector's Report. I regret to have to record the death of Mr. McClelland, the Chief Sanitary Inspector, after a protracted illness which was a great loss both to me and the Public Health Department. His keeness for work was, I think, appreciated by all, and his absence from duty threw a great burden on the staff and on his deputy who, after a lapse of six months, was appointed Senior Sanitary Inspector in his stead. I am certain he will prove to be equally reliable and a great worker, and apart from the personal loss, will give the Council and myself the same loyalty which the late Sanitary Inspector endeavourei to give. As suggested in my previous report it might be as well for the Council to consider the provision of accommodation for the elderly people in the form of blocks of houses, hostels, etc. and I suggest that further homes should be erected in addition to quota to combat the possible increasing overcrowding. The practice of permitting two or three families to occupy rooms in one house, and to use the only kitchen in most cases and other offices seeus to me to be a rather retrogade step to the health of the inhabitants and, for want of a better term "moral overcrowding", leading to mental strain, distress and other undesirable features. It is interesting to note that the number of new houses, (with the exception of those rebuilt following enemy action) and the conversion of flats, total 173, out of which 119 were built by privet enterprise and only 54 by local authorities.

The charges agreed are 5/per treatment, and during 1947 seventyeight cases were treated. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply The water throughout the district is furnished by the Metropolitan Water Board, and is a constant supply of excellent quality. I am supplied with monthly reports by the Board giving details of their chemical and bacteriological examinations. All dwelling houses have a mains supply direct to the house. Swimming Baths and Pools Publicly owned baths. Surbiton Lagoon, situated in aeburn Avenue, Surbiton, is an open air pool 165 feet long and 90 feet wide with a depth of 3 to 9 feet. The water is treated by continuous pressure and filtration, sterilisation by injection of chlorine and oxygenation over an ornamental cascade. Periodical samples of water are taken by the Borough Engineer and Surveyor and the plant adjusted accordingly. In addition, check samples are taken by the Public Health Department. During the period of 1.947 certain restrictions were put on the pools as to the number to be admitted during each session. The children's sand pit was closed as one of the means of preventing any further spread of poliomyelitis. -12- FOOD POISONING There were three small food poisoning occurrences during the year. In the first cose two persons are slightly ill due apparently to eating sausages which had been kept too long before cooking. The responsible organism was not traced. The second occurrence affected five persons and was probably due to eating goose. The affected persons were seriously ill and the responsible organism was found to be Salmonella typhi-murium. Unfortunately the remaining portion of the suspected goose was thrown away and the only specimen therefrom was a small quantity of fat, while did not reveal Salm. typhi-murium. By arrangement with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries blood specimens were token from ten geese and thirty ducks at the smallholding from which the suspected bird come, but with negative results. Rats from the vicinity were also examined without result. The third occurrence was part of a widespread outbreok involving a large area in the South East due to eating a meat product which had been infected with Staphylococcus aureus at the factory where it was made. Six cases occurred in the Borough end there were probably other which were not brought to my notice. All the patients were affected with vomiting and diarrhoea, (two seriously) the symptons occurring within three hours of eating the food. All mode o rapid recovery. FACTORIES APT, 1937.

The Town Council provided two Ambulances (a Daimler 20 h.p. and a Talbot 10 h.p.) for dealing with accidents and Private cases in the Borough. The personnel consisted of two drivers and two attendants, Untill November this staff was responsible for day and night duties, working 24 hour shifts. -19- With the adoption of the recommendations of the National Joint Council for Staff of Hospitals and Allied Institutions the Council came to an arrangement with the British Fed Cross Society whereby that organisation provided an ambulance service between the hours of 10 p.m. and 0 a.m. drily, leaving the Corporation ambulances to cover the hours from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. During the year 371 accident and 607 private eases were dealt with by the Council ambulances, the milleage covered being 7,897 miles. The British Red Cross Society dealt with 24 private and 2 accident cases. BUILDING LICENCES. During the year 688 applications for building licences, involving 842 visits to premises, were dealt with in the Department and suitable recommendations made to the Borough Surveyor who is Licensing Officer. COUNCIL HOUSES AMD REQUISITIONED PROPERTIES. The work of maintenance of Council houses and the adaptation and maintenance of requisitioned properties was dealt with in the Department until towards the end of the year when the duties were taken over by the nowly-appointed Housing Officer.

The responsibility for disinfestation rests by law upon the occupiers of premises, and during this year a charge was made when occupiers requested the Corporation to carry out the work on their behalf. The scale approved by the Town Council was 2/6d per servicing visit which included labour, transport, traps, poisons and baits. Special terms were quoted for cases requiring long-term treatment. No charge was made for inspections and advisory visits. In June the Corporation appointed an operator and a labourer to assist the Rodent Officer with this work, and as a result considerable progress was made in dealing with surface infestations and work on sewers was commenced. The following figures summarise the work carried out. Total number of complaints 203 (A few of these referred to the same infestations) . -21- 1. VISITS.

All wore passed as fit for human consumption except one pig which was affected with generalized tuberculosis, and was surrendered and destroyed. ICE CREAM. Thirteen premises were registered by the Corporation for the manufacture, storage and sale of ice cream, and sixty-two for storage and sale but not manufacture. On 1st May, 1947, the Ice-Cream (Heat Treatment etc) Regulations made by the Minister of Health carlo into force with the exception of the requirement relating to thermometers, and with a "delay" clause in connection with the provision of cooling apparatus. Broadly, the Regulations deal with methods of manufacture and storage of ice cream, and with measures to prevent contaminate -26- The Minister stated that he had given consideration to the proscription in the Regulations of a bacteriological standard of cleanliness for ice-cream , but be was still not satisfied that there was any tost the reliability ??? was sufficiently established to justify its use as a ??? with which would constitute an of fence. ???, however, draw attention to a form of methylene blue test,??? for testing ice cream which night provisionally bo used as a ??? to cleanliness. He suggested that where ice-cream consistently failed to reach Grades I and II it would be reasonable to regard this as indicating defects of manufacture or handling, calling for further investigation. It should be noted that this tost is not a neons of chocking the safety of ice-cream, but only a guide to cleanliness. Because of the possibility of error in the test itself it is suggested that frequent samples should be taken from each retailer and manufacturer, and the hygienic quality thereof judged not on a single result but on a series of results. It was not possible during 1947 to take many samples, and as it was our first experience with the now test, as well as its first use in the Laboratory, I do not think that firm conclusions should be drawn from the results. All retailers were supplied with a copy of each Laboratory report, and a Sanitary Inspector visited the premises and gave advice thereon. Copy reports were also sent to the Sanitary Inspector for the district where manufacture took place. It is hoped in future years to take a much larger number of samples, and it is anticipated that with wider experience, the tost will prove of greater value. For record purposes the following table is given shewing Laboratory Reports on ice cream. samples taken during the year. Ref ,No. >. Date Vendor Whether manufd. in Boro.

There were forty-one persons registered in accordance with the Milk and Dairies Order, 1926,. as follows:- Cowkeepers 6 Retail purveyors of milk residing in the district 27 Retail purveyors residing outside the district but retailing in the district 0 In consequence of the Rationalisation Scheme only thirteen retailers are now selling milk in the Borough, but the others have expressed a wish not to be removed from the Register. Eight dealers' licences to sell "Pasteurised" milk, 3ix to sell "Tuberculin Tested" milk, two supplementary licences to sell "Pasteurised" milk and two to sell "Tuberculin Tested" milk were granted under the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1936-46. Forty-eight samples of milk wore taken for phosphatase test to ascertain if pasteurisation had boon properly carried out, and all found to be satisfactory* Fifteen samples of Pasteurised milk were taken for Methylene Blue test. Eight were found to be satisfactory and seven unsatisfactory. These seven samples all came from the same dairy, five being taken on one day in an attempt to account for complaints received. As a result of action taken the standard of the milk was improved and complaints ceased. Four samples of "Tuberculin.Tested (Pasteurised)" milk were taken for Methylene Blue and Phosphatase tests. These milks all came from the same farm; three samples passed both tests, but the fourth failed on the Phosphatase test, and the matter was reported to the local authority in whose district the farm was situated. Two samples of "Tuberculin Tested (Fasteurised)" were taken for methylene blue test only and both passed. PUBLIC MORTUARY During the year sixty-eight bodies were received into the mortuary and sixty-eight post mortem examinations were carried out. FACTORIES AND BAKEHOUSES. The total number of factories on the register at the end of the year was 216. The businesses carried on at the respective premises were as follows:- Bakehouses. 17 Laundries 7 Cleaners and Dyers. 6 Tailors. 5 Engineers (various) 50 -29- Steel Hardeners 2 Printers 6 Builders, Joiners and Plumbers 24 Boot Repairers 10 Motor Engineers 24 Cycle Repairers 3 Radio and Electrical Engineers 12 Spectacle Frame Manufacturers 3 Dressmakers 3 Works of building censtruction 6 Miscellaneous. 38 69 visits were mad to factories and bakehouses, and as a result works were carried out to remedy contraventions as under; Additional W,Cs. provided. 2 factories. Flushing cisterns repaired. 1 factory. Moans of escape in case of fire put in order. 1 factory. Miscellaneous. 3 factories. One certificate was issued under section 34 of the Factories Act, 1937, that the factory to which it related was provided with such means of escape in case of fire for the persons employed there as may be reasonably required in the circumstances of the case. There were 20 outworkers on the register at the end of the year. 18 visits of inspection were made but no contraventions found. The absence of the late Chief Sanitary Inspector and Housing Officer on sick leave during the early part of the year, followed by his untimely death at the end of March, was a severe blow to the Department. In July the Town Council decided that the management of council houses and requisitioned properties as well as dealing with over 2500 applicants for accomodation had become a task of such magnitude that a separate Department under an independent Housing Officer was called for . Th;i3 decision was duly implemented, and by the end of the year the new Department was staffed and functioning. The transfer of these duties, coupled with some degree of permanence of staff which now seems possible, should enable the Department to function with proper efficiency. CONCLUSION I am grateful to my colleagues in other Departments, and to my own staff for their support during a rather difficult year. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H.J. ELDRIDGE. Senior Sanitary Inspector -30- I wish to thank all the members of my staff for their assistance during the past year.
