Tuberculosis Dispensaries. Since the last Annual Report, the three Dispensaries in the Borough have continued on the same lines. The alteration in the size of the three areas has proved satisfactory. The appointment of the Tuberculosis Officers to the Poor Law Hospitals for consultative purposes has been the means of bringing the Dispensaries into contact with a much larger number of patients suffering from the disease, particularly advanced infective cases. It has also served to strengthen the co-operation between the Hospitals and the Dispensaries. One of our greatest problems still remains, viz., the chronic and infective patient Many of these cases are comparatively fit, but they are, none the less, a source of danger to others. Permanent institutional treatment for isolation purposes is, in most cases, out of the question on account of the long period necessary. Assuming the necessary accommodation to be available, most patients would not remain in an institution for periods running, in some cases, into years. In order to try and prevent the spread of the disease to the children of consumptive parents, a movement has been initiated recently by the London County Council, the object of which is to remove children from their homes for the last three months or so of the parents' life. It is a modification of the French method whereby babies of tuberculous mothers are removed to healthy surroundings immediately after birth. Whether these half measures will prove to be beneficial remains to be seen, but I think it savours somewhat of "Locking the stable door after the horse has escaped." Co-operation between the private doctors and the Tuberculosis Officers becomes closer every year. Larger numbers of patients are now examined at the dispensaries at the request of private doctors in the district, and more patients were examined in the homes of the patients than formerly. 17 New Patients. The following tables show analyses of the patients who have been examined for the first time. TABLE 1.

All children of school age who are suffering or suspected to be suffering from tuberculosis are now kept under frequent observation either by the London County Council School Medical Officers or by the Tuberculosis Officers. Case cards are exchanged with the School Medical Officers regarding all such children examined, and the necessary observati n is then carried out either by them or by the Tuberculosis Officers— depending upon the nature of the individual case. 18 This arrangement ensures that all "contacts" of school age are examined. It is still found impossible, however, to persuade all adult "contacts" to be examined, particularly male "contacts." Insured Patients. Table II shows an analysis of the Insured patients. TABLE II.

Very few patients have been recommended for industrial training from the Dispensaries, largely on account of the great difficulty— in fact, the impossibility —of obtaining work on the expiration of the training period. Until employment in this country becomes satisfactory, it will remain impossible for men whose working capacity is impaired to obtain work in the open market. 19 Table IV. shows a general statement of the work during the year.

Fourteen applications were received during the year from the London Hospital respecting 7 patients undergoing Finsen Light Treatment. Payment was guaranteed by the Council for 168 attendances. Twenty-five Refills were supplied by the Brompton Hospital with respect to 2 patients receiving Artificial Pneumo-Thorax Treatment. Payments were made by the Council for such Refills. Leprosy. A woman suffering from leprosy was brought to my notice. She is about 55 years of age and was born in Austria. Her parents separated when she was a baby, and she was brought up by friends. When she was a child, she came over to England to look for her father. It was impossible to obtain any further information from her, as she is obviously mentally defective—whether due to her illness or whether she has always been so—I am not in a position to state. She went to live in Glasgow, and about ten years ago she got married in London. After about four or five years of married life, her husband, who was about 70 years of age, died suddenly in 1918 outside his residence in Turner Street when he was returning from the Synagogue. An inquest was held, and the verdict was "Found dead—Heart failure -natural." From inquiries which I made I found that the husband had an eruption on the face, which might very well be that of leprosy, and in that case the patient might have contracted the disease from him. Otherwise it is very difficult to account for the fact of her having contracted leprosy. For about four years she lived in a house in Cannon Street Road and then she developed an eruption on the face. She went to the London Hospital where the disease was diagnosed as leprosy. She was, on the recommendation of the Skin Specialist of the London Hospital, admitted to the St. George-in-the-East Hospital, but after being there for a few months, she discharged herself, but she was refused admission at Cannon Street Road. She was taken by somebody to Greeneld Street, where, according to the occupier of the latter premises, she was "dumped on them." She again attended the London Hospital and was again sent to St. George's Hospital, but after a short stay she discharged herself and returned to Greenfield Street. The occupiers of these premises were unaware of her real disease, and in any case the premises were totally unsuited for the purpose of housing her, and I communicated with the Ministry of Health on the matter. The Leper Colony receive male patients only and she was removed to a Home in the countrv at the expense of the Guardians. 24 Infantile Mortality. 407 infants died under one year of age, or 35 more than in the previous year. 105 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 69 per 1,000 births. 68 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of 75 per 1,000 births. 163 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 72 per 1,000 births. 71 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 87 per 1,000 births.

Stepney Health Week was held from October 4th to October 10th inclusive. The Town Clerk wrote to the Ministers of Religion and asked them to make a reference to the subject in their sermons on Saturday or Sunday, and we have every reason to believe that this was done in a large number of churches, chapels and synagogues. On Monday, October 6th, at 3 o'clock, the Exhibition was opened by Mr. Arthur Greenwood, Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health, and His Worship the Mayor (Alderman Prevost) took the Chair. A Baby Show was held on this day fcr male babies under one year of age, and 88 took part in the competition. The prizes were given and distributed by the Mayor. Films were shown to senior children on " Swat that Fly," and on the care of the teeth—" The Ivory Castles." From 6 to 7 o'clock the films " Our Children " and " Public Health Twins " were given to a good audience. Later in the evening a lecture was given on Venereal Disease to a mixed audience by Mrs. Clayton and Dr. Sloan Chesser, when about 250 people were present.

The competition for female babies under one year of age took place, and 70 babies were entered for this competition. The prizes were given and distributed on this occasion by Mr. H. Potter, a late Mayor of Stepney. At 4.15 p.m. a dental film was shown to schoolchildren in charge of two schoolmasters, and they were addressed on the care of the teeth and tooth brush drill, by Mr. F. Lawrence, a dentist of Whitechapel Road. At 5 o'clock, children were admitted into the Hall, and it became very crowded, and several children had to be refused admission because of want of room. Films were shown—" The Ivory Castles " and "A Fight in Fairyland " —both films having a bearing on the care of the teeth, and the necessity of keeping them clean. At 6 o'clock cinematograph films on " Our Children " and " Our Mothers and Babies " were shown to a mixed adult audience. 30 At 7.30, a lecture and cinematograph film on Tuberculosis was given by Dr. Goss—the Senior Tuberculosis Officer—when an audience of about 200 was present.

Champneys, Bart., Vice-President of the National Council for Combating Venereal Diseases and Consulting Surgeon Accoucheur at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. The Chair was taken by Alderman (Mrs.) Reidy. 49 male babies between one and two years of age took part in the Baby Show competition, and prizes were given by Councillor (Dr.) J. J. Reidy, J.P. At 5 o'clock cinematograph films were shown to children. The hall was so crowded that the Dentist was not able to make much impression on the children with his remarks on the care of the teeth. Other films were shown between 6 o'clock and 7.30 to an adult audience. At 7.30 a lecture on Venereal Disease was given by Dr. Feldman for men only, and a film, "Whatsoever a Man Soweth" was shown. The hall was crowded, at least a hundred had to stand up at the back and sides of the hall, and admission had to be refused to a large number afterwards. On Thursday, October 9th, the Exhibition was opened by Rabbi Dayan A. Feldman, and the Chair was taken by Councillor (Miss) M. Moses, J.P. Chairman of the Public Health Committee. The prizes for female babies between one and two years of age were given by Councillor H. Kosky, J.P., and were distributed by Councillor (Miss) Moses. 39 babies were entered for this competition. At 5 p.m. a lecture on Ante-Natal Care was given by Dr. Eardley Holland, Assistant Obstetric Surgeon to the London Hospital, when a good audience of Nurses, Midwives, Health Visitors and Social Workers was present. From 6 to 7 o'clock, cinematograph films on "Social Hygiene for Women" and on "Venereal Disease" were shown. At 7.30 a lecture on "Health and Happiness" was given by Dr. E. Sloan Chesser, the Chair being taken by Alderman Keefe. An audience of about 250 was present. On Friday, October 10th, a Baby Show was held for children of both sexes between 2 and 5 years of age, when 109 children competed.

At 6.30 a cinematograph film for a mixed audience was shown entitled "Public Health Twins" and a lecture on Venereal Disease was given together with a film called "The Gift of Life." At 7.30 Dr. C. W. Saleeby gave a lecture on "Sunlight and Babyhood," when the chair was taken by Alderman W. C. Johnson, J.P. There was a very good and appreciative audience. A short film belonging to the Electricity Department was shown each day, giving the advantage of electric light for heating and power, etc. The two Exhibitions on Infant Welfare and Venereal Diseases were well attended each day from 4 o'clock until 7.30. Demonstrations in the care of infants from birth up to two years of age were given daily as well as in first aid and bandaging. Model menus for children and invalids were shown by the Invalid Kitchen's Association, Health Week efforts were quite successful due to the efforts of all who took part in its organisation, more especially Dr. Browne, the Health Visitors, and the clerks engaged in the Maternal and Infant Welfare Department.

A ship containing dried Apricots was accidentally sunk in the River Thames. These dried Apricots were salved from the sunken vessel and landed in this Borough. An application was made to me to allow these Apricots to be exported to Hamburg. In consequence of their unsound condition I refused the application. Part of this cargo had already been sold to a firm in Hamburg, but as I was not satisfied as to the object for which they were to be exported, I refused to release it until it had been examined by a Justice. The matter was, therefore, taken to Court, and the applicant intimated that the Apricots were to be used for cattle food. The Magistrate, however, was not satisfied that this was the case and adjourned the matter. At a subsequent hearing, an agent from the firm in Hamburg gave evidence as to their destination, and stated, on oath, that they would not be used for anything but for cattle feeding, The consignment was then released. I communicated with the Health Authorities in Hamburg, and stated the destination and object for which they were to be exported, but I received no acknowledgment of my letter (although it was written in German), nor have I received any information that they were not used for the purpose of being prepared into human food. 35 Disinfecting; Station. 1,449 rooms were fumigated, and the bedding, etc., were removed and disinfected by steam.

To the Mayor. Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my first Annual Report, dealing with the work carried out in the Borough Laboratory during the year 1024. As I commenced my duties here on February 25th, my report covers two months during which the office of Public Analyst was held by my predecessor. During the year, 1,496 samples were submitted to me for analysis. Of these, 1,456 were purchased by Inspectors under the Food and Drugs Acts; 35 samples were analysed for the Public Health Department ; 2 for the Borough Engineer's Department; and 3 for private purchasers. The 1,456 samples taken under the Food and Drugs Acts comprised 959 formal samples and 497 informal samples. Table A shows the nature of the samples taken under the Food and Drugs Acts, and gives the numbers and percentages found to be adulterated. TABLE A. Number of Samples. Number Genuine.

This figure could reasonably be raised to 3.25 per cent. The calculation of the amount of adulteration by removal of milk-fat is based on the figure 3.0 and this obviously in the majority of cases gives a figure far from the truth and distinctly favourable to the vendor, e.g. a sample of milk giving on analysis 2.9 per cent. of fat is returned as 3.3 per cent. deficient in fat. Assuming the milk to have been originally of the average quality containing 3.7 per cent. of fat the deficiency becomes 21.6 per cent. or using 3.25 as a reasonable figure for calculation the deficiency is 10.8 per cent. Again a sample containing the average 3.7 per cent. of fat may be adulterated by depriving it of 19 per cent. of its fat and it will still satisfy the standard. The figure for solids.not.fat follows a normal course in each month, with the exception of December, where an average figure of 8.54 is shown. Although this includes a number of adulterated samples this figure is far too low, as in November, December and January, the milk should be rich in solids.not-fat, A similarly low figure namely 8'60 was obtained in December, 1920. There is no doubt that milk is subjected to a great deal of careful adulteration, good quality milks being "adjusted" to what is considered to be a margin of safety as compared with the legal standard. 65 Much has been made of the fact that genuine samples of milk have been obtained which on analvsis were found to be below the standard. This may be so in the case of individual cows, but such deficiencies hardly ever occur when the mixed milk of a herd is taken. Although it has been held that it is no offence to sell milk which is below the standard, but which is the actual product of the cow, even if the deficiency is brought about by improper feeding or milking, it is the business of the farmer by a process of selection and the weeding out of cows giving milk of poor quality to ensure that the mixed milk of the herd is of satisfactory composition. By the presumptive standard of the Board of Agriculture milk below the standard is not necessarily adulterated and milk above the standard is not necessarily genuine. If this presumptive standard were made absolute it would legalise the " adjustment " of the quality of milk to pass that standard, but, particularly if the standard for milk-fat be raised, a supply of milk of reasonably good quality, whether previou dy adjusted or not, would result, as poor quality and slightly watered milks would be eliminated. In eases where the adulteration is large, say 10 per cent. and upwards of added water, convictions are usually readily obtained, but there is more difficulty in obtaining a fine when the adulteration ranges from 4 to 6 per cent. of added water. It must be remembered that this figure, when an average quality milk has been adulterated is about 2 per cent. lower than the truth. The weekly sale of 300 gallons of milk adulterated with 5 per cent. of water means the sale of 15 gallons of water at 2s. a gallon or 30s. per week apart from legitimate profits, and if the vendor be detected a caution or small fine is the usual result for the first offence. In the Final Report of the Departmental Committee on the use of Preservatives and Colouring Matters in Food (1924), the following paragraph occurs under the heading of Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations:— "An amendment of the law is required to render more expeditious the prosecution of a person actually responsible for offences under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, where a warranty defence is pleaded." The Warranty Clause, primarily intended to protect the honest tradesman has become a convenient method of evasion for the fraudulent trader, and it is high time that this clause be so amended as to protect the public against the same. 66 Table H. shows the extent of the adulteration and the action taken in each case.

In one case the vendor was not registered as a purveyor of milk and was fined £1 (Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order). In two cases the vehicle and receptacle were not inscribed with the name and address of the vendor. The vendor was cautioned. 67 Butter. 140 samples were examined, of which 3 or 2T per cent. were returned as adulterated. H. 7 Consisted of Margarine. Vendor cautioned.

label was not printed in the manner prescribed by the Regulations:— T 79 (Informal) Caution authorised by the Ministry of Health The composition of sweetened and unsweetened condensed full cream milk and condensed skimmed milk has been standardised by the Public Health (Condensed Milk) Regulations, 1923 Rules with respect to the labelling of condensed milk are stated and the label must declare the number of pints of milk or skimmed milk equivalent to the total contents of the tin For the purposes of these Rules, milk means milk which contains not less than 124 per cent, of milk-solids (including not less than 36 per cent, of milk fat), and skimmed milk means milk which contains not less than 9 per cent, of milk-solids other than milk fat Sponge Cake 12 samples examined were genuine Of these one informal sample was found to contain 009 per cent, or 63 grains per pound of boric acid; a repeat sample taken formally showed 004 per cent, or 28 grains per pound of boric acid Representatives of the Bakery Allied Traders' Association (Ministry of Health Circular 381) have agreed not to import Liquid Whole Egg containing more than one per cent (70 grains per pound) of boric acid, and that Liquid Whole Egg must not be used in the manufacture of Sponge Fingers, Sponge Biscuits and the small variety of plain sponge cakes No restriction, however, is made on the use of butter or margarine which may legally contain 05 per cent (85 grains per pound) of boric acid, nor is the Presence of Boric Acid definitely prohibited No objection can be raised therefore to the presence of small quantities of boric acid, unless it can be proved that the boric acid resulted from the use of liquid whole egg Fruit Wine, Four samples were analysed Of these three were artificially coloured and were preserved with 13, 26 and 26 grains of salicylic acid per pint respectively The Departmental Committee on Food Preservatives in 1901 recommended that salicylic acid should not be used in greater proportion than 1 grain per pint in liquid food In a recent report (Reports on Public Health and Medical Subjects No 24), the Government Chemist found that, out of 142 samples of nonalcoholic wines, 71 contained salicylic acid in amounts ranging from a trace to 12 grains salicylic acid per pint and that 24 of these contained, in addition, sulphurous acid or boric acid In the remaining 71 samples the addition of salicylic acid had evidently not been found necessary 71 The Draft Rules and Orders, Public Health (Preservatives, &c, in Food) Proposed Regulations, 1925, prohibit the addition of salicylic acid but allow a maximum of 5 grains benzoic acid per pint in non-alcoholic wines Spirits Six samples were examined One sample of brandy was found to contain 225 per cent, excess water, the remainder were genuine, being either 35 degrees under proof or of the strength declared when the sample was purchased F 46 Brandy, 225 per cent, excess water Vendor paid £5 5s costs The position with regard to the adulteration of spirits is still unsatisfactory, In a recent High Court decision, it was held that the notice "All spirits sold on this establishment are diluted and no alcoholic strength is guaranteed" could not be accepted as a protection The sample in this case was 4226 degrees under proof (equal to 11*7 per cent, excess water) In a later case at Bow Street Police Court where the sample of whisky was 48 degrees under proof (equal to 20 per cent, excess water) and a similar notice was displayed, it was held that the notice afforded protection as the defendant had not sold the spirit at an unreasonable degree of dilution as was shown by the price It is not possible for the purchaser to know whether the price paid is a reasonable one as the degree of dilution cannot be ascertained and definite statements as to the number of degrees under proof to which the spirit has been reduced are often without meaning to the purchaser Draft Rules and Orders of the Public Health, (Preservatives, &c, in Food) Regulations, 1925, Proposed to be made by the Minister of Health Briefly, these Regulations contain the following provisions:— (1) No cream to contain any thickening substance (2) No article of food to contain any added preservative except:— (a) Sulphur Dioxide (in seven classes of food) (b) Benzoic Acid (in three classes of food) (3) No article of food to contain both Sulphur Dioxide and Benzoic Acid (4) Permitted preserved foods to be labelled (5) Permitted preservatives to be labelled (6) The use of certain metallic, vegetable and coal tar colouring matters, to be prohibited 72 If and when these Regulations come into operation the use of boron compounds in butter, margarine, cream, cake, etc, and salicylic acid in jams, non-alcoholic wines, etc, will become illegal The Public Health (Milk and Cream) Regulations, 1912, and the 1917 amendment thereto will be revoked Drugs Of 83 drugs examined, four were adulterated E 85 Sweet Spirit
