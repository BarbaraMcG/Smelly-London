Nuisances abated during the year 1339 Chiswick Urban District Council. Public Health Department, Town Hall. To the Chairman and Members of the Chiswick Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Annual Report for the year 1911, and in doing so, I am able to report that the general health of the district has been fairly maintained and that no epidemic of a very serious nature, conducive to a high rate of mortality, has prevailed during the period embraced by the statistics given. The deaths from zymotic disease, which may always be taken as a fair test of the sanitary condition of a locality, compare very favourably with any preceding year, more especially taking into consideration the annual increase of population. The population at the last general census taken in April was found to be 38,705 compared with that of 1801, when it was 3,233, the increase in the century and a decade amounting to 35,472. 6 Births. These numbered 877, of which 465 were males, and 412 were females. The birth rate was 23.21 per thousand of the population; that for London was 25.0, and for England and Wales 24.4. Deaths. The number registered in the district was 373 (172 males, 201 females). The death rate was 9.60 per thousand; for London it was 15.8, and for England and Wales 14.6. The number of deaths of residents registered outside the district was 122 and of non-residents registered in the district 17 ; the net total number of deaths for the district being therefore 478. The death rate was 12.30. The deaths from the principal zymotic diseases amounted to 66 compared with 25 for the year 1910, and were attributed to the following diseases:— Measles 7 Scarlet Fever 2 Diphtheria 8 Whooping Cough 6 Enteric Fever 3 Diarrhœa 14 Enteritis 8 Croup 0 Erysipelas 0 Puerperal Fever 1 Total 49 7 The Zymotic death rate was 1.26, against 0.66 for 1910; that for London was 2.2. The death rate for the different wards is as follows: Bedford Park 8.36 Chiswick Park 13.23 Grove Park 12.44 Gunnersbury 9.27 Old Chiswick 12.69 Turnham Green 15.38 Infantile Mortality. On referring to Table IV, you will observe that the number of children who died under the age of one year was 86, which includes 15 under one month, and was equal to 98 per thousand registered births compared with 69.9 for the preceding year. For London it was 128, and for England and Wales 118. The abnormal summer heat, which was fully enjoyed by all in good health, was responsible for a considerable increase in the number of deaths of young children under five years of age, more especially during the months of July, August and September. This increase was not confined exclusively to this locality; in London alone there were during the year, nearly 3,000 more deaths than in 1910, all of which were attributable to the excessive heat of the months which I have mentioned. Old Age. One hundred and forty-three persons died aged 60 and upwards, including twenty-five between 70 and 80, fourteen between 80 and 90, and three between 90 and 95. 8 Notifications. These amounted to 377, an increase of 90 on the previous year, due in a great measure to the larger number of cases of phthisis and chicken-pox. I append a table showing their headings for the last and the three preceding years:— 1911— Small-pox 0 Cholera 0 Diphtheria (including Membranous Croup) 41 Erysipelas 40 Scarlet Fever 97 Typhus „ 0 Enteric „ 15 Continued Fever 0 Puerperal Fever I Phthisis, under Tuberculosis Regulations 1908 11 Do. under do., 1911 32 Others 29 Chicken-pox (Varicella) 111 Total 377 1910— Scarlet Fever 125 Diphtheria 58 Enteric Fever 4 Erysipelas 41 Phthisis (Voluntary) 39 „ under Regulations, 1908 19 Total 286 9 1909- Scarlet Fever 117 Enteric Fever 7 Diphtheria (including Membranous Croup) 52 Puerperal Fever 1 Erysipelas 46 Phthisis 55 Total 278 1908— Scarlet Fever 89 Enteric „ 5 Diphtheria 32 Phthisis 1 Erysipelas 38 Total 165 Scarlet Fever and Scarlatina Were less prevalent than during 1910. Some of the cases were, however, of a more severe type than in that year. A severe outbreak occurred at the end of April, 19 crises being notified. The patients with only two exceptions were supplied with milk from a local Dairy, and after a careful investigation, the complaint was clearly traced to this cause. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. Fortyone notifications and 8 deaths were ascribed to these diseases. A certain proportion of suspicious sore throats were also brought under my notice. However, after the usual bacteriological examination was made, it was found, that several cases were regarded as true diphtheria. 10 Typhoid or Enteric Fever. During the year 15 cases were notified, of which 3 ended fatally. Each case was carefully investigated, with the result that both milk and water could be exculpated from any share in the dissemination of the disease. Several were imported cases, and in two there was evidence that shell fish had been the cause of the disease. Diarrhœa, (Including "Enteritis" and "Gastro Enteritis") was responsible for 22 deaths as compared with 8 in 1910. Thirteen of these deaths were those of infants under two years of age, and are more fully referred to "Infantile Mortality," Table IV. Measles. A sharp outbreak of this complaint occurred in February, and resulted in seven deaths. It was prevalent during the spring and summer. The fatalities were mostly the result of pulmonary complications. A certain proportion of cases became known to me through the Council's School Officials. It is a matter of importance that the public should be educated in regard to measles, and the only practical way is to convince people of two facts: 1st, that the complaint may prove a very serious and fatal disease; 2nd, that it is practically never fatal, provided a few elementary precautions are taken in the earlier stagesof the illness. 11 Whooping Cough Occurred during the early spring, and part of the summer, resulting in 6 deaths, compared with 9 for the year 1910. Cancer or Malignant Disease Was responsible for 30 deaths, 15 males, 15 females,, whilst for the previous year they numbered 26.

Phthisis or Pulmonary Tuberculosis Resulted in 27 deaths. During the previous year there were 34. The Local Government Board have now completed their system of the compulsory notification of this serious disease, which was introduced in a partial and tentative form by the Regulations of 1908, which applies to Poor Law patients It will, I believe, be generally acknowledged that in considering the question of compulsory notification, the Board have displayed a thorough grasp of the requirements of the situation. Although compulsory notification has been lately advocated by most public health workers, who have devoted themselves to the subject, there have been those who have urged that the inconveniences which may attend the general application of the principle of compulsory notification are sufficiently great to outweigh any advantages which might be anticipated. Provisions for the compulsory notification of tuberculosis were granted by Parliament in the Council's Act of 1911, tout have been held in abeyance, as the general order of the Local Government Board above referred to came into operation at the same date as was proposed by the Council's Act.

I can but repeat the statement which I made in my last Annual Report, that all milk for consumption, more especially in the case of young children, should be for a moment brought to the boiling point or sterilized. By these means the risk of acquiring tuberculosis, diphtheria and scarlet fever is lessened considerably. There is only one cowshed in the district at the present time, consequently the major portion of the milk supply comes direct from the country daily by rail or otherwise. Infantile Purulent Ophthalmia. In my report for September, I called the attention of the Public Health Committee to the fact of several cases of infantile purulent ophthalmia having been brought before my notice, and, fully realizing the serious nature of this disease, I strongly recommended that it should be added to the list of compulsorily notifiable diseases. This has since been done. It is a matter of importance that more stringent instructions should be given to midwives on the seriousness of diseases of the eye in newly-born children. It has been suggested that the "Central Midwives" Board should issue such instructions. In the month of December I received a Circular from the Local Government Board recommending that, in the interest of the public health, the diseases known as "Acute Poliomyelitis" and "Cerebrospinal Fever" should be made notifiable. They are both serious diseases, acute poliomyelitis being more 16 general in children and less frequent in adults, a large proportion of those who survive, in serious cases, being left disabled by muscular paralysis. Water Supply. The whole of the district is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board. One of the advantages of the Local Act is, that it requires every house shall be supplied with water direct from the main. Unfortunately, the powers in the past have not been adequate to compel a direct supply in every case. It is a matter of importance, that all cisterns used for the storage of water for domestic purposes, should be placed in proper situations, and be provided with covers and kept clean. Cremation. There were five persons cremated during the year. Although a certain amount of prejudice exists against this form of disposal of the dead, it is far more sanitary than the custom hitherto carried out, and as the population grows and the cemeteries become full, the prejudice against it will become less. Public Abattoirs. I should much like to see private slaughter-houses entirely done away with, and superseded by Public Abattoirs, as is the case in many large towns and cities, notably Liverpool, Manchester and Croydon. They afford greater facilities for meat inspection, many of the private slaughter-houses being located in unsuitable situations. 17 In July I attended before the Local Legislation; Committee of the House of Commons, and gave evidence in reference to therecent Local Act. Inquests. There were 19 during the year Of this number 13. deaths were attributed to natural causes, two to accidental suffocation, two to drowning, one tohanging a case of suicide), and one to an accident. Sanitary Inspection. During the year I have personally inspected a certain number of insanitary and dilapidated housesin the parish. Many were old and damp, owing tostructural defects rendering them unfit for habitation until repaired and cleansed under Section 46 of the Public Health Act. Surface Water Drainage. I must take this opportunity of referring to the surface water drainage of Gunnersbury, which has recentlv been carried out under the supervision of your Engineer, who has kindly given me the following details appertaining to his department, but affecting the health of the district. Surface water sewers have been laid in Chiswick High Road (portion), Oxford Road (northern portion), Clarence Road, Wellesley Road (from Clarence Road to Railway bridge), Brook Road, Paxton Road, 18 Belmont Place, Grove Park Station Road, Clifton Gardens (portion), Bourne Place (portion), Stamford Brook Avenue (portion), Prebend Gardens (portion), Vanghan Avenue and Pleydell Avenue ; the majority having been laid without the intervention of a contractor. Open Air Bath. The mixed and family bathing originally started by the Council has continued to prove eminently successful and has now been followed by other municipalities. An independent sample of the water was taken just prior to cleansing, and the purity of same was proved thoroughly satisfactory as shown by analysis. Packhorse Improvement. A very considerable improvement from a sanitary point of view has been made by the re-erection of the Old Packhorse public-house and the removal of all the old property adjoining same at the western end of Essex Place to make room for a new Music Hall, the roadway and footways have both been widened in the main road, and there will be a 20-ft. passage-way on either side of the new building. Education. A site for a new Secondary School has been purchased in Burlington Lane from the Duke of Devonshire, and it is hoped the building will be commenced this year. A new elementary school for 420 boys is 19 being erected in rear of the present school at Strandon-the-Green, and will be ready for occupation in July or August, 1912. Commons. A small area of the Back Common adjoining, Turnham Green Terrace, has been laid out and planted with a view to improving the amenities of this part of the district, and when considered in conjunction with the new and widened bridges over Turnham Green Terrace, the result has given general satisfaction. New Buildings. Sixty-six dwelling houses have been completed and occupied during the past year, whilst nineteen additions, three lock-up shops, and ten temporary buildings have been completed, including the entire re-construction of the London General Omnibus Co.'s motor garage in Belmont Road. Motor Ambulance. This continued its useful purpose, and I am able to testify as to the many advantages the parishioners have experienced in cases of sudden illness or accidents, by the rapid and expeditious way patients have been conveyed, either to hospitals or infirmaries. Isolation Hospital. This was opened on the 7th April, 1904, for the admission of patients suffering from scarlet fever, enteric, or diphtheria. It contains 20 beds in three blocks, and stands in three acres of ground situated 20 at Clayponds Lane, Brentford. The staff consists of a Matron, Staff Nurse and Assistant, and two Probationers, together with a porter and his wife, wholive in the lodge. On the arrival of a patient an intimation is at once sent by the Matron to the relatives or friends as shown on page 23. On the discharge of a patient, and before leaving the institution, he or she has a disinfectant bath, and is well rubbed with eucalyptus oil, and a notice as shown on page 23 is given to the friends or relatives. The number of admissions into the Hospital since date of opening is upwards of 900. With regard to the number of patients admitted during the year, there were 78, compared with 126 for 1910 and 122 for 1909. Scarlet Fever 56 (13 adults, 43 children). Enteric „ 5 (all adults). Diphtheria 17 (4 adults, 13 children; one —being a patient from Slough). 78 Only 6 Deaths occurred (4 diphtheria, 1 scarlet fever, and 1 enteric). Most of these patients were in a critical state on admission. Although there was a decrease in the number of patients admitted during the year, several cases were of a severe type of disease and occurred amongst very young children. As regards diphtheria, in each case three swabs are taken from both throat and nose of the patient and submitted to a pathological examination, one on admission, and two subsequently. No patient is allowed to leave the hospital until the result of the examination is negative. 21 The reports of your chief Sanitary Inspector, and of your Health Visitor, are appended, and also the usual tables of the Local Government Board. Before concluding this report, I must express my appreciation of the kind consideration which I have received from the Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee during the year. I also tender my thanks to my official colleagues for their assistance, and to the staffs both of the Public Health Department and Hospital for their valuable services. I am, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, FREDc. C. DODSWORTH, Medical Officer of Health, Medical Superintendent of the Isolation Hospital, Fellow of the Society of Medical Officers of Health, Member of the Royal Society of Medicine. 22 Public Health Department, Town Hall, Chiswick, W. HEALTH VISITOR'S REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1911. Sir, I beg to report that during the year ended 31st December, 1911, I have registered the notifications of 886 births, and in 662 cases I have visited the homes. The total number of visits and re-visits during the year was 1,334. There were 46 deaths amongst the infants visited, and of these 23 were artificially fed. Eleven died from premature birth, &c., before I visited the homes, and nine deaths occurred amongst infants under one year of age who were born outside the district. Of the total number of children under one year of age ten deaths occurred in various institutions outside the district. During the year, thirty-one notifications of stillborn births have been received. As you are aware, 72 cases of phthisis and tuberculosis have been notified, and 43 of these have been enquired into and reported upon. The majority of the patients have been re-visited from time to time. Yours obediently, J. CRU1CKSHANK, Health Visitor. 23 CHISWICK ISOLATION HOSPITAL. Notice Given on Admission of Patient. Personal enquiries at the hospital respecting patients therein, can only be made on Wednesdays and Sundays, between the hours of 2 and 4 p.m., except in special cases, as to which notice will be given to the relatives as occasion may require. Information as to all patients can be obtained at the Public Health Department, Town Hall, Chiswick, daily (except Sundays), from 9.30 to 12 a.m. Notice Given on Discharge of Patient. It is highly undesirable that, for two or three weeks after being discharged from hospital, a patient should sleep, kiss or come into immediate contact with other persons. Although every precaution is taken to see that patients are free from infection before being discharged from hospital, it must be understood that no amount of vigilancecan guard against a recurrence of infectiousness, and this, though rarely, does occur in some cases. Should a patient " catch cold " any time within a few weeks of leaving hospital, or should discharge from the nose or ear be noticed, a medical man should be communicated with, and pending his advice, the patient should be temporarily isolated. Diphtheria Patients. If in the course of the next few weeks, after leaving the hospital any alteration of voice, defect in the sight, loss of power in the limbs, or difficulty in swallowing should be observed, a medical man should be consulted at once, and the patient kept at rest in bed until his arrival.

Urban District of Chiswick ANNUAL REPORT of the Chief Sanitary Inspector. 1911. JOHN H. CLARKE, M.R.San. I., Cert. R.I.P.H., &c., Chief Sanitary Inspector. Urban District of Chiswick Public Health Department, Town Hall, Chiswick, W. January, 1912. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, In accordance with the Order and Circular of the Local Government Board, I have the honour to submit my Twentieth Annual Report, giving a resume of the work carried out by your sanitary staff during the past year. I am also appending the usual tables, giving particulars of the systematic inspections, houseto-house inspection, and the varied sanitary work performed in pursuance of the Public Health Acts, etc. In submitting this report, I may state that although the health of the district has been maintained at a high standard (as will be seen on reference to the report of the Medical Officer of Health), considerable activity has been displayed in promptly dealing with cases of infectious disease, the testing and making good of drainage, the removal of general nuisances, the inspection of food, and inspections under the Regulations as to the systematic inspection of the district. 4 The amendment of the procedure for Closing Orders, etc., under the Housing Acts, in respect of insanitary property, has very much increased the work of the Department, and during the year under review many houses have been represented as being unfit for human habitation, full particulars of which are given in the section on the Housing Acts. As in previous reports, I am giving a brief account of my duties performed in accordance with the Orders of the Local Government Board and the Council, under the following headings:— (а) General and Systematic Inspection of the District. (b) Housing of the Working Classes Acts. (c) House Drainage. (d) Water Supply. (e) Infectious Diseases and Disinfection. (f) Factory and Workshop Acts. (g) Dairies, Cowsheds, Milkshops, Slaughterhouses, Fish-shops, etc. (h) Food Inspection. (i) Sale of Food and Drug Acts. (j) Petroleum Acts. (k) General Matters. House-to-House Inspection. The Housing (Inspection of District) Regulations, which were made by the Local Government Board under the powers conferred on them by Section 17, 5 Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909, have been strictly complied with. I referred in my last annual report to the provisions of the Regulations, which require that the local authority shall, as part of their procedure under the Section referred to, make provision for a thorough inspection to be carried out from time to time, according to the varying needs or circumstances of the dwelling-houses or localities in the district of the local authority, and also that the officer making the inspection shall examine the state of the dwellinghouse in relation to the following matters, namely— (1) The arrangements for preventing the contamination of the water supply. (2) Closet accommodation. (3) Drainage. (4) The condition of the dwellinghouse in regard to light, the free circulation of air, dampness and cleanliness. (5) The paving, drainage and sanitary condition of any yard or outhouses belonging to or occupied with the dwelling-house. (6) The arrangements for the deposit of refuse and ashes. (7) The existence of any room which would in pursuance of sub-section (7) of Section 17 of the Act of 1909 be a dwelling-house so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. (8) Any defects in other matters which may tend to render the dwelling-house dangerous or injurious to the health of an inhabitant. House-to-house inspection is made with a view to ascertaining the existence of nuisances and obtaining their immediate abatement, and also for the purpose of examining the houses as to their suitability for 6 human habitation. The first-mentioned duties have' been repeatedly urged on local authorities by the Local Government Board in their various circulars, and under the heading of " Powers and Duties of Councils" in the circular issued with the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1911, the importance of frequent inspection is again emphasized as. follows:— " Apart from the actual treatment of cases, the " Board would again urge on local authorities the " great importance of their making full use of " their powers of preventing overcrowding and of " securing the removal of any conditions tending " to injure the health of persons residing in their " district." I have in many previous reports referred to the useful purposes served by a system of thorough houseto-house inspection of a district, which is productive of good in so many ways that it may certainly be looked upon as one of the principal duties of a Sanitary Inspector. During the year under review, 2,607 houses were inspected in compliance with the Regulations. They included 1,035 tenements, housing 10,624 adults and 5,413 children, as will be seen on referring to Table IV. The provisions of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907, dealing with the paving of yards and the fixing of sinks, have been found to be of great use, and their reasonable application has resulted; in the paving or repairing of 422 yards and the provision of 191 sinks in connection with dwelling 7 houses. Other sanitary defects remedied were 102 defective and leaky drains, 64 choked drains, 194 insufficient water supplies to water-closets, 108 defective soil-pipes and drain ventilators, 596 premises requiring repairing and cleansing, and 96 drinking water cisterns so placed, constructed or kept as to render the water therein liable to contamination, causing or likely to cause risk to health. With regard to the inspection of the Sulhamstead Estate, I reported that many of the houses contain basements, and that as a number of the underground rooms are used for sleeping purposes, care was exercised to ensure that the provisions of sub-section 7 of Section 17 of the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909, were not contravened. I also suggested for the consideration of the Public Health Committee, the question of making Regulations under the Section referred to. The Committee decided to make Regulations with respect to such rooms, and they are now awaiting the consent of the Local Government Board. In the Strand-on-the-Green area, my attention was called to the overcrowded and insanitary state of a house in Waldeck Road, particulars of which were entered in the Nuisance Register, and in respect of which notices were served on the occupiers. The house was let in three tenements, and after making several inspections of the first floor flat, I was compelled to ask for instructions to issue summonses against the. first floor occupiers, who were living in an extremely filthy state. Orders were made against the defendants, who were severely cautioned, and they 8 resulted in an improved condition of the premises. These cases are by no means uncommon, and the letting of a house in two or more tenements, particularly where it was originally intended for occupation by one family, is primarily responsible. From personal experience I am convinced that the filth, squalor and other evils which are so apparent in certain neighbourhoods are the result of such methods of housing the poor, more especially is this so where the landlord or some other responsible person does not exercise control over the entire house, and I am of opinion that the practice referred to, which is increasing year by year, cannot be too strongly condemned. The occupier of another flat in Waldeck Road complained to the Local Government Board of the insanitary state of the premises, and on making an inspection I found that the rooms in the occupation of the complainant were, as a result of his neglectful and dirty habits, in an unwholesome condition, as was also the food cupboard; and the water-closet, which which was of modern construction, was in a most filthy state. This house had recently been redecorated and cleansed throughout, and the tenant had been served with an ejectment order prior to his complaint to the Local Government Board. Having regard to the fact that the drains of several houses in the High Road and Grove Park Terrace were found to be in a defective and leaky condition, the Committee instructed that a house - to - house inspection should be made of certain parts of these roads. The inspection was made, the nuisances 9 and sanitary defects discovered were reported for the service of statutory notices, and they have since been remedied. Housing of the Working Classes Ants. The passing of the Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act, 1909, has very considerably increased the powers of local authorities for dealing with insanitary property, but it is a matter for regret that, in Section 14 of the new Act, the condition implied in the contract for letting that the house is fit for human habitation, was not applied to houses of a higher rental. In the Administrative County of London, Section 14 applies to a house, or part of a house, let at a rent not exceeding £40, but in this district it only applies to houses let at a rent not exceeding £16, and there are very few houses or flats in Chiswick which are let at the rental mentioned. The effect of this is that Section 15 (which extends the condition implied by the previous section to include an undertaking that the house shall, during the holding, be kept by the landlord in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation) is practically of no use so far as this district is concerned. I would also point out, that in their memorandum on the Housing, Town Planning,. &c., Act, 1909, the Local Government Board refer to the advisability of Councils resorting to the provisions of Section 15 for securing that houses (within the rental limits mentioned) are put by the landlord into habitable repair, in preference to enforcing the powers conferred upon them by Sections 17 and 18 in. 10 regard to the closing and demolition of houses which become unfit for human habitation. I was compelled to call the attention of the Council to the difficulties which arose through the service of notices on occupiers, of the Council's intention to make Closing Orders. This procedure was carried out in accordance with the recommendation of the Local Government Board that notice should be given to all persons interested in the house, whether within the definition of owner or not ; but as it caused considerable and unnecessary trouble in almost every case, the Committee decided to defer the giving of notice to occupiers until the statutory proceedings are commenced, As the proceedings to enforce repairs to houses could not be taken under Section 15, in every case where the premises were found to be unfit for human habitation, notice was given of the Council's intention to make a Closing Order, and the statutory requirements were subsequently complied with. Sixty-nine houses were thus dealt with during the year, particulars of which are as follows No. 1 Church Street.—Subsequent to the Council's notice of intention to make a Closing Order, the owner executed the necessary repairs inside the house, and the question of the condition of the flank wall was referred to the Surveyor. Nos. 1 and 2, Church Walk.—These two cottages were reported to the Council as being unfit for human habitation by reason of insufficient light and II tion and various other defects. Prior to the making of Closing Orders, the owner signified his intention of converting the two houses into one, and this has since been done. Additional windows have been provided, the sanitary accommodation has been re-arranged and other necessary work executed. Nos. I to 12 and 14 to 19, William Street.—Representation under Section 17 of the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909, has been made in respect of these cottages in consequence of their very insanitary condition, but up to the end of the year no further action other than the making of Closing Orders was taken in respect of this property, owing to the fact that the Council had not completed certain enquiries •with regard thereto. Nos. 10 to 18, Wood Street, and Nos. 1 to 7, Furze Street.—In consequence of the very dilapidated and insanitary condition of these dwellings, I made the required representation under the Housing Acts, but before the Closing Orders were made, the owner requested that he might be allowed to submit a statement of works which he was prepared to carry out at the houses in question. The statement was approved by the Committee, and the houses have since been thoroughly overhauled and rendered sanitary. No. 165, Devonshire Road.—This house, an unoccupied one, was in such a neglected, dilapidated and dangerous condition as to be unfit for human habitation. A Closing Order was made, and up to the end of the year, when the Closing Order had 12 not expired, the owner had not signified his intention of executing any repairs. Nos, 4 and 6, Essex Place.—Representation in respect of these cottages was made owing to their very dilapidated, damp and insanitary condition. The premises were thoroughly renovated, new waterclosets built, and the whole of the ground surface within the external walls concreted. At the end of the year certain other work remained to be executed. Nos. 31 and 33, Essex Place.—Service of Closing. Orders resulted in the owner's agents preparing a specification of suggested alterations and repairs at these two houses. The execution of the work was approved by the Committee, and on completion of the repairs the Closing Orders were determined. No. 35, Essex Place.—Immediately the Closing Order was issued the owner gave instructions for this cottage to be thoroughly repaired and put in proper order, and as a result the Council subsequently determined their Order. No. 37, Essex Place.—As this house is unoccupied and there was some difficulty in ascertaining the names of all persons interested therein, the matter wasnot disposed of at the close of the year. Nos. 49 to 59, Essex Place.'—Closing Orders were served with respect to this property, and the ownerssubsequently submitted a statement of works which it was proposed to execute in order to comply with the Council's requirements. The statement was approved,. 13 and on completion of the specified works, the Closing Orders were determined. Nos. 61 and 63, Essex Place.—The usual representation was made with respect to the insanitary condition of these dwellings. Closing Orders were made and the property was demolished without the service of demolition orders. No. 175, Devonshire Road.—Complaint was made by the occupier of this house and, owing to the very insanitary state of the premises, representation under "the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909, was made to the Council. The owners gave instructions for the execution of the necessary work, and the Closing Order has since been determined. No. 20, Fisher's Lane.-The walls, ceilings and flooring of this house were in a generally dilapidated state, there was no through ventilation, the watercloset was dilapidated, and other sanitary defects existed. A Closing Order was issued, but the dwelling has now been put into a state fit for human habitation. Nos. 6 and 8, Wood Street.—Closing Orders were made with respect to these two cottages, and the property has since been purchased by the owner of the adjoining houses, who has signified his intention of carrying out any necessary work, as required by the Council. Nos. 495-513, High Road.—This property was in a generally dilapidated and insanitary state; thepantiled 14 roofs were defective, brickwork at rear decayed and dilapidated, the back additions and water-closets were very dilapidated, and, in several instances, dangerous ; the yards required properly paving and draining, the majority of the houses were without sinks and a proper supply of water, and the walls, ceilings, floors, staircasesand woodwork generally, required thoroughly overhauling and repairing. The owner's surveyor has submitted a statement of proposed works, which has been approved by the Committee, and the work is in hand. Closing Orders were not made in this case. Nos. 124-130, Chiswick Lane.—During the houseto-house inspection of the Manor House Estate these cottages were found to be in such an insanitary condition as to warrant action being taken under the Housing Acts. However, prior to the making of Closing Orders, the owners agreed to comply with the Council's requirements, and the work is in hand. House Drainage. This important part of sanitary work has received the usual careful attention, and during the year 305 drains were examined, tested and exposed for inspection, etc. 102 of these were re-constructed in accordance with the Council's bye-laws and 145 were repaired. Amongst the principal work which has been carried out during the past year, in connection with house drainage, is the re-construction of the whole of the drains at Nos. 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 and 17, Barrowgate 15 Road, Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 17, 19 and 21, Grove Park Terrace, Nos. 63, 65, 67 and 69, Devonshire Road, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5, Bond Street and Nos. 13S to 146, ThamesRoad. It is a pleasure to be able to record that the Council by their private Act, which received the Royal Assent on the 18th August, 1911, have disposed of the difficulties which were constantly arising in connection with combined drainage, and consequently it will now be possibly to equitably deal with all matters which may arise in relation to private drainage, and the enormous expense incurred (spread over a number of years) in the re-construction or repair of certain private drains, will now be obviated. Water Supply. The whole of the district is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board, and the only matters in connection with the water supply which have required to be dealt with by this department have been the method of service and storage, and in this respect we have been able to obtain the provision of 96 more houses with a supply direct from the main. In every case which has come under our notice where the drinking water is obtained from a cistern, care has been taken to ensure that the supply is not in consequence liable to contamination. Infectious Diseases and Disinfection. The work in connection with infectious diseases is carried out under the direct control of the Medical 16 Officer of Health. Immediately on receipt of a notification, enquiries are at once made at the premises of which the patient is an inmate, and where removal to the Council's Isolation Hospital is desirable, arrangements are made and the removal of the patient superintended by one of the sanitary staff. Disinfection by means of spraying with formalin or by fumigation with formaldehyde is carried out after the removal or convalescence of infectious patients, and where necessary infected articles are removed for steam disinfection. Notices are also served requiring the thorough stripping, disinfection and cleansing of the infected and other rooms where such work is certified by the Medical Officer of Health as being necessary for the prevention of the spread of infectious disease. With regard to the sanitary condition of the houses from whence cases of infectious disease were notified, I have to report that in very few instances was a nuisance found to exist, and such a result can only be attained by a system of sanitary supervision such as your Committee have approved of. I may mention that the disinfection of rooms and infected articles has been carried out after all cases of phthisis which have been brought to our notice and also after cases of cancer, etc., where required by the occupiers of the infected houses. Factory and Workshop Acts. A register of all workshops in this district is kept as required by statute, and in addition, particulars of the various factories are included in order that the 17 tion under these Acts may be as complete as possible. Apart from ordinary visits, the whole of the registered premises are inspected at least once during the year. My report on the annual inspection during the period under review is as follows :— Factory and Workshop Acts :— " I have now completed my annual inspection of the premises in the district, required under the Factory and Workshop Acts, and beg to submit my report thereon. There is a decrease in the number of factories and workshops, but such slight variations as there are from year to year, are chiefly due to the establishment or removal of small workshops. "The contravention of the Acts are again not only small in number, but also of minor importance, and are, therefore, evidence of the strict supervision which is exercised by the officers concerned. I might also again mention that the majority of the responsible persons in connection with the factories and workshops appear to exercise every precaution to ensure that the requirements of the Acts are complied with. " During the inspection I have given special attention to any contraventions which might arise from want of cleanliness, over-crowding, absence of proper ventilation, defective drainage and sanitary accommodation, and other nuisances, and I am pleased to be able to record that, with the exception of several instances in which it was necessary to administer cautions, the sanitary state of the premises inspected is satisfactory. "I discovered one case of over-crowding; but, upon the occupier's attention being called to the matter, immediate steps were taken for the abatement of the same. Cards supplied by the Council are exhibited in the workrooms, 18 showing how many persons may be employed in each room and there is no doubt that they do much towards preventing the evil of over-crowding. "Four notices have been received from H.M. Inspectors of Factories. One referred to a case of over-crowding, one to insufficient sanitary accommodation, and the remaining two were in respect of minor matters. All were immediately attended to. "The home-work provisions have been most carefully complied with, and lists have been forwarded to the local authorities of the districts in which the out-workers reside. Lists have also been received of out-workers resident in this district, all of which have been registered as required. " I am submitting the usual particulars as to the trades represented, and the number of factories, workshops, etc." FACTORIES. Trades Represented. Number of Premises.

Quarterly inspections are made of all the dairies,, cowsheds, milkshops, slaughter-houses, fishshops, 20 houses, etc., and care is exercised to ensure that the requirements of the Orders and Regulations with respect to the use of such premises are strictly complied with. In all dairies and milkshops the use of a suitable covering for the milk receptacles has been insisted on by the Medical Officer of Health as a means of preventing the contamination of the milk by Hies, dirt, etc. It is much to be regretted that local authorities have not the power to refuse to register under the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, premises which are unsuitable, as by this means the proper sanitary condition of dairies, etc., would be obtained before the establishment of the business, and subsequent trouble both to local authorities and proprietors of dairies would be obviated. Food Inspection. The food supply of the district has been carefully supervised, but I am pleased to report that with the exception of taking action in the case of the sale of some unsound meat trimmings, I was not called upon to exercise the provisions of the Public Health Acts with respect to the condemnation of food. Proceedings were instituted against the vendor of the meat referred to, and the defendant was fined £5 and costs. It is important to note that the Council now have power to prohibit the use of private slaughter-houses in this district, after the provision of a public abattoir, the erection of which is becoming more and more 21 essential as the district increases. It is impossible to over-estimate the value of a thorough supervision of the slaughtering of animals the meat of which is intended for human consumption. Under existing conditions the slaughtering is carried on at all times, and an adequate inspection cannot therefore be made, although the local butchers are always most ready to give us every facility. Great care appears to be exercised in the selection of animals for slaughter, but it is only necessary to visit the City of London Corporation Slaughter-houses at the Metropolitan Cattle Market, to be convinced of the necessity for the expert inspection, such as is carried out at that Market, of every animal slaughtered. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. The total number of samples purchased under these Acts for analysis was 6u, viz.:—Milk, 24; separated milk, 8 ; butter, 27 ; and ginger ale, 1; 28 were submitted as informal samples. Certificates as to adulterated articles were submitted in respect of one sample of milk, two samples of separated milk and one sample of butter. The vendor of both samples of separated milk, which were respectively adulterated with 7 per cent, of added water, was summoned and fined £3 and costs in each case. The vendor of the adulterated butter was fined £5 and costs. With regard to the sample of new milk, which was adulterated with 9 per cent, of added water, the defendant company gave notice of their intention to 22 rely on a warranty, but the Court upheld the objection to its use, in view of the fact that the notice was not sent within seven days from the service of the summons. The company was fined £5 and costs, but appealed against the decision, and the case was not disposed of at the end of the year. The sample of ginger ale was submitted to me by a resident, and on analysis it was found that the bottle had also contained a quantity of writing ink. Careful enquiries were made in the matter, and a surprise visit was paid to the mineral water works from which the sample was supplied. It was found that every precaution was taken to prevent foreign matter getting into the bottles, and it was suggested that the bottle had been maliciously tampered with. It is unfortunate that coloured bottles are used for the sale of mineral waters, and this case emphasizes the need for the use of clear glass bottles for such a purpose. Petroleum Acts. Due attention has been given to the provisions of of the Petroleum Acts, and also to the Orders in Council with respect to other substances of a like nature, and to the Regulations as to petroleum used for light locomotives. All premises on which petroleum is stored are registered for periodical inspection, and during the year licences were issued under the Petroleum Acts in respect of 18 store-places, the quantities of petrol kept varying from 10 to 2,000 gallons. 23 General Matters. The requirements of the Middlesex County Council (General) Powers Act with respect to Ice Creams, have been complied with, a register being kept of all premises whereon ice-cream is made. Inspections have also been made of the several marine stores in the district in order to obtain compliance with the provisions with respect thereto of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907. In conclusion, I beg to tender my grateful thanks to the Council, the Committee, and the Medical Officer of Health for the support and kind consideration which have always been extended to me in the performance of my duties; also to my First Assistant (Mr. Burr) and the staff for their loyal support. It is gratifying to report the interest evinced in the work of the Department of my Assistants, which is emphasized by the fact that Mr. Burr has obtained the Meat Inspector's qualifying certificate at the examination held by the Royal Sanitary Institute, which I know involved a considerable amount of theoretical and practical work. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, John H. Clarke, Chief Sanitary Inspector. TABLE I. CHISWICK URBAN DISTRICT. County of Middlesex.—Sanitary Work, 1911. Inspections.
