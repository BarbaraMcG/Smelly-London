WOODFORD, 15, Nightingale Place, Woolwich. Town Hall, Woolwich. 28th February, 1896. To The Chairman and Members of the Woolwich Local Board of Health. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my report upon the sanitary condition of Woolwich during the year 1895. Mortality There have been 771 deaths during the year, of this number 340 occurred in the Dockyard Registration SubDistrict, and 431 in the Arsenal Registration Sub-District. The gross death rate for the year, estimated upon a population of 42,768, is 18.02 per thousand. Of these deaths 181 took place in various medical institutions (Table 7) outside the district, in the appended statistical tables they have however been allotted to their proper registration sub-districts, and calculated as if taking place within the sanitary area of Woolwich. Twenty-three deaths occurring within the district were of persons not rightly belonging to Woolwich, if these be deducted from the total deaths, the correct number of deaths occurring in Woolwich during the twelve months ending the 31st December, 1895, will be obtained, viz., 748. 6 Death Rate. The corrected death rate is therefore 17.48 per thousand. The following table shows the corrected death rate yearly, since the appointment of a Medical Officer of Health for the district, on the 29th October, 1889. 1890 2°.5 1891 21 .6 1892 19.5 1893 19. 1894 l8. 1895 17.4 The death rate for 1895—which is the lowest on record for the district—bears striking testimony to the success of the efforts which have been made during the past few years to better the conditions under which the inhabitants live. I do not wish to attach undue weight to this fact of a low mortality rate for the year, but the continuous steady fall may I think be fairly taken to indicate an improved condition of things in Woolwich. I have appended tables Nos. 9 and 10, which show comparatively the position taken by Woolwich in this respect to other large towns, and to the various Metropolitan Sanitary Districts. Of the total deaths 291 were of children under 5 years, and 457 of persons above that age, of the 291 children, 209 were of infants under one year of age. Here again a total improvement is to be noted over the preceding years as illustrated by the following table, the deaths of infants however under one year are more than in preceding years, whilst those between one and five years are less. 7  Total Deaths. Deaths under one year. Deaths between the ages of one and five years 1890 838 215 141 1891 885 222 117 1892 806 198 95 1893 828 210 105 1894 755 177 113 1895 748 209 82 In table 5 will be found a comparison of the deaths occurring in the sanitary district of Woolwich during the years 1893, 1894, and 1895, distinguishing those under 5 years of age and those over five years of age. Zymotic The Deaths from all causes during the year included 6 from Measles, 11 from Scarlet Fever, 24 from Diarrhoea, 14 from Diphtheria, 3 from Whooping Cough, 9 from Typhoid Fever, and 12 from Influenza, in all 79 deaths from diseases classified by the Registrar General as Specific Febrile or Zymotic. This is equivalent to a Zymotic death rate of 1 .8 per thousand. The deaths from Influenza, Diarrhoea and Enteric Fever are in excess of those from the same causes last year, when they were respectively 4, 19 and 5, but those from Scarlet Fever, Measles and Pertussis have fallen from 22, 39 and 8 respectively, whilst those from Diphtneria remain at the same figure, viz., 14. The Zymotic death rate for the past five years is as follows 1891 2.8 1892 2.4 1893 2.6 1894 2.6 1895 1.8 8 In class IV. 119 deaths are recorded as arising from some form of tubercular disease, of which number 49 occurred in the Dockyard Registration Sub-District, and 70 in the Arsenal Registration Sub-District. The great difference between these numbers is occasioned not by the deaths from Tabes Mesenterica, Tubercular Meningitis and Hydrocephalus, but to deaths from Phthisis, which were 34 in the Dockyard Registration Sub-District, and 49 in the Arsenal. Twentythree of the total deaths were of children under 5 years of age and 96 at ages from 5 and upwards. The deaths registered during the past five years as arising from Tubercular causes were as follows : 1891 139 1892 112 1893 121 1894 126 1895 119 I have in previous reports drawn marked attention to the mortality from Tubercular causes in the district, and indicated its grave importance. As I have before remarked there is no doubt that in most, if not all of the older houses of the district, there is no provision to prevent dampness, and especially is this the case with the houses in North Woolwich, and to this defect I attribute much of the evil. The Sanitary Authority must continue to insist upon all proper means being adopted to remedy this, fraught as it obviously is with the most serious injury to health. Sex Of the total deaths in the Arsenal Registration Sub- Mortahty. there were 258 males and 173 females, in the Dockyard Registration Sub-District 186 males and 154 females, or in other words, of the 771 total deaths in the whole district 444 were of males and 327 of females. 195 deaths were of persons over 60 years of age. Phthisis, Mortality, etc. Sex Mortality. Of the total deaths in the Arsenal Registration SubDistrict there were 258 males and 173 females, in the Dockyard Registration Sub-District 186 males and 154 females, or in other words, of the 771 total deaths in the whole district 444 were of males and 327 of females. 195 deaths were of persons over 60 years of age. 9 Births and Birth Rate. The number of births registered during the year were 1,323. Of these 13 were recorded as illegitimate. The birth rate is therefore 30.9 per thousand. That for the Dockyard being 27.8 per thousand, and for the Arsenal 33.8. For the past five years the birth rate has been as follows: 1891 32.7 1892 29.9 1893 31.3 1894 30.5 1895 30.9 Marriages. There have been 579 marriages registered during the year, in the first quarter 112, in the second 137, in the third 142, and in the fourth 188. Inquests and Suicides. There have been 58 Inquests during the year. There have been 10 Suicides as follows:—Cut Throat 2, Hanging 1, Poison 4, Shooting 1, Drowning 1, and Suicide on Railway 1. Mortuary. Fifty-two bodies were received into the Mortuary, of which 30 were of persons resident in the district, and 22 non-resident. Infectious Diseases. During the year 340 cases of Infectious disease have been notified as follows :— Arsenal Sub-District. Dockyard Sub-District. Total. Scarlet Fever 103 84 187 Diphtheria 28 39 67 Erysipelas 17 16 33 Typhoid 36 14 50 Small Pox — 1 1 Puerperal Fever 1 1 2 Typhus - - - Total 185 155 340 IO Of these 340 cases 212 were removed to Hospital, as follows :— Arsenal Sub-District. Dockyard Sub-District. Total. Scarlet Fever 67 67 134 Diphtheria 13 26 39 Typhoid Fever 31 7 38 Small Pox — 1 1 Total 111 101 212 In other words, the following cases were treated at home in their respective districts:— Arsenal Sub-District. Dockyard Sub-District. . Scarlet Fever 36 17 53 Diphtheria 15 13 28 Erysipelas 17 16 33 Typhoid Fever 5 7 12 Puerperal Fever 1 1 2 Total 74 54 128 I note with satisfaction the greatly increased tendency for cases of infectious disease to be sent to Hospital. The privileges offered to the inhabitants of free admission to the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board is a great boon, and one which it is somewhat surprising is not availed of to its fullest extent, but doubtless the number of admissions would have been greater this year if accommodation at the Hospitals had been available. I hope when the Brook Hospital at Shooter's Hill is opened, which is expected to be the case in June, we shall no longer experience a drawback in this respect. The total amount of Infectious Disease present in Woolwich during the year has been in excess of that in 1894, and this is principally due to a larger amount of Diphtheria and Typhoid Fever, the number of cases of Scarlet Fever has been less. The following table will show the prevalence of the principal Zymotic diseases during the past six years. 11  1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 Scarlet Fever 100 80 338 259 215 187 Diphtheria 10 8 17 24 49 67 Typhoid Fever 16 11 18 25 14 50 Small Pox — — 2 6l 15 1 And on reference to the following returns of the Metropolitan Asylums Board we get the notifications received by that Board for the corresponding six years from the whole of London. 1890 189I 1892 !893 1894 1895 Scarlet Fever 15330 11398 27095 36901 10655 19757 Diphtheria 5870 5907 7781 13026 18440 10772 Typhoid Eever 2877 3372 2465 3663 3360 3506 Small Pox 60 114 423 2813 1 192 979 Much attention has of late years been given to the increased incidence of Diphtheria in London, and many causes for the same have been assigned. It is to be hoped that the report which is being prepared for the School Board for London will show clearly whether the suggestion that school attendance has anything to do with the spread of the disease is true or not. As I pointed out last year, it was now clearly understood that the cause of the disease was a small organism which gained access to the mucous membrane of the throat, and in its growth gave rise to a poison which became absorbed into the system ; the so-called anti-toxic serum treatment of the disease depends upon the introduction into the system of an antidote to this poison. The statistics of the Metropolitan Asylums Board upon this subject have not yet been published, but from the evidence which can be obtained there appears to be no doubt that in this remedy—which was discovered by Dr. Behring, of Berlin—we have a powerful remedy, the good effects of which being most manifest the earlier it is used in the course of the disease. 12 In my last report I made the suggestion that facilities should be afforded to Medical Officers of Health for obtaining a Bacteriological examination of the throat in cases of sore throat to determine whether the affection was Diphtheritic or not. This would appear the more desirable from the fact to which I have alluded of the necessity for the early treatment of such cases to obtain the greatest success. Small Pox has been entirely absent from Woolwich during the year, one case was notified, but this was subsequently found to be Chicken Pox, a notable fact when we remember the prevalence of the disease at West Ham and in other neighbouring districts. The notification of Infectious Diseases still continues to work well and without friction. Disinfection. During the year 6412 articles of clothing, bedding, etc., have been disinfected (Table XVI). Sickness Returns. I append a table giving the sickness returns from various sources for the year. (Table XIX). Common Lodging Houses. There are 38 common lodging houses in the district. The control of these houses is now under the London County Council, they are generally well conducted, and the proprietors continue to evince a desire to co-operate in every way with the Sanitary Officials. On the evening of Monday, the 4th November, the following were the number of persons sleeping in these houses. Single men 537 Single women 35 Couples 81 Children 24 Total 677 The following was the per centage of the available beds occupied in the district on this night: 13 Single men beds 81 .36 per cent. Single women beds 6862 „ „ Married couple beds 94.18 „ „ Slaughter Houses. There are 7 slaughter houses licensed in the district, and the licencees generally observe all the regulations in force by the London County Council. I hope in the interests of the trade as well as of the public that the time is not far distant when all these will be done away with and that Woolwich will have a public Abattoir under the control of its Local Authority, for in such a case not only will an undesirable adjunct to the business premises be removed, but the opportunity will be given for a more regular and systematic inspection of the meat supply of the district. Bakehouses. These have during this year been systematically visited and compliance with the regulations enforced. There are 40 bakehouses in the district, structurally many of them are most defective, but legally the greatest difficulties exist for abolishing them. It is satisfactory to note that no new bakehouse from the 1st January, 1896, will be allowed to be below ground. Rag & Bone Shops. These have been regularly visited, and have called for no special action on the part of the officials. Cow Sheds, Milk Shops, &c. There are 3 licensed cowsheds in the district, these together with the milk shops, &c., have been subjected to constant supervision. The Market. The market has been systematically visited both by night and da)', occasionally only has it been found necessary to seize food as unfit for human consumption, the meat is frequently, however, of poor quality. Dust Collection. 'The pail system continues to work most satisfactorily. 'The dust is removed weekly from every house in the district, and from some of the streets in the poorer parts of the town twice or thrice weekly. 14 The destructor provided by the Board works very satisfactorily both by night and day. I append in Table XXVI. an interesting financial statement prepared by Mr. H. O. Thomas, the Surveyor to the Board, relative to its use, which shows a considerable saving financially to the district. Housing of the Working Classes Act. The number of houses dealt with under this Act, has necessarily not been so large as in previous years. Certificates were however given in reference to 11 houses, and three of these were subsequently demolished. Underground Rooms. The question of underground rooms as dwelling rooms has been under serious consideration so far as Woolwich is concerned, the present stringent regulations on this subject will I think have the effect of abolishing the use of all these places, for I think it will be impossible for your Board to relax the regulations as laid down by the Public Health Act, and I certainly shall be unable from a Public Health point of view to advise any such course to be adopted. Houses let in Lodgings. The Bye-laws relative to these have now received the approval of the Local Government Board, and will at once be put in force. It will be necessary to employ additional help to obtain proper measurements of rooms in houses recommended for registration, and it certainly will be necessary that a re-arrangement of the duties of the Sanitary Inspectors should be made to enable them to deal with the additional work of inspection imposed thereby. Sanitary and other Improvements The most noteworthy events which have happened during he year, and which have a beneficial influence upon the health and progress of the district are :— 1, The adoption of the Public Libraries Act. 15 2. The opening of the Churchyard, in connection with the Parish Church, as a recreation ground, on May 31st, 1895, by the Duke and Duchess of Fife. 3. The rebuilding of houses in Powis Street, Hare Street, William Street, etc. 4. The approval of an underground urinal for Beresford Square. 5. The scarcity of water in North Woolwich, a district supplied by the East London Water Co. 6. The satisfactory use of the Baths—no less than 129,385 men and 16,350 women, or a total of 145,735 persons having used them in 1895. Sanitary Requisites. t. The urgent necessity which exists for providing clerical assistance in the Sanitary Department. The clerical work is now thrown upon the Sanitary Inspectors, and necessarily interferes greatly with the discharge of their proper duties ; the work in this respect, even during the past two years has doubled itself, and every year brings additional work in the keeping of fresh books and making returns. The new Bye-laws for Houses let in Lodgings will also add largely to the clerical work. 2. The necessity for taking steps to extend the provisions of the Infectious Disease Notification Act to the Woolwich Garrison. Conclusion. I cannot close this report without alluding to the death of the Senior Sanitary Inspector, J. Carty, which took place on the 9th July, 1895. He had been ill for some time, but for many years he had been connected with the Health work of the town, and had in earlier days particularly, rendered very useful services. I would again acknowledge the kindness and consideration I have received from the Board and particularly from The Public Health Committee, to the Chairman and Members of which I beg to tender my thanks, 16 Inspectors Mackie and Woolley have continued to discharge their duties satisfactorily. Inspector Mackie, at much personal inconvenience, has continued to render valuable aid in the ever increasing clerical work of the department. It is satisfactory to note year by year the improvements which are taking place in the conditions under which the people of Woolwich live, improvements which must effect results of a far reaching nature and which in the improved death rate, and in other directions, have already been productive of marked results. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, WILLIAM R. SMITH, M.D., D.Sc., F.R.S., Ed., Medical Officer of Health, and Public Analyst for Woolwich. 17 TABLE L Deaths Registered from all causes in the Year 1895, in the Sanitary Area of Woolwich, including Deaths of Non-Parishioners, also Deaths of Parishioners occurring in various Public Lnstitutions outside the District.

Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in presenting my Second Annual Report of the working of the Refuse Destructor for the period of one year ending 6th December, 1894. The quantity of refuse that passed through the cells during that period amounted to 10,573 loads, being an increase of 606 loads on the previous year. The cost of the disposal of which, under the old system of barging away, at 1/6 per cubic yard, would have been £1,585 19 O, calculating each load to represent two cubic yards. 319 tons of fishmongers' and butchers' ofl'al were also destroyed during the year. The outgoings of the Destructor, including capital ancl interest on loans wages, breeze for cremator, gas, water and other expenses, were as follows:— £ s. c £ s. d. Capital and Interest on Loans for erection of Destructor 486 5 10 Wages, gross 587 13 2 Cr. Man's time attending Disinfector, and the value of the Clinkers, etc., used on the roads by the Local Board, estimated at 6d. per load 75 7 0 By Sale of Clinkers, etc., 1,137 loads at 6d. per load 28 8 6 103 15 6 483 17 8 Carting away old tins, 67 loads at 2/6 8 7 6 Breeze for Cremator, 294 cubic yards at 2/6 36 15 0 Gas 31 6 8 Water 5 0 0 Repairs to Barrows, etc. 8 5 2 Two New Navvy Barrows 3 8 0 Repairs to Cells, etc., and to Destructor generally 48 14 9 Clogs for Stokers 1 19 0 £1113 19 7 £ s. d. The removal by Barges would have cost 1585 19 0 The disposal of the same quantity by Destructor cost "13 19 7 Shewing a saving of £471 19 5 The saving would have been greater during this period but for the increase of the wages of the stokers. However, it is satisfactory to me to be able to shew a saving for the year greater than that for the first year. Yours obediently, H. O. THOMAS, A.M.I.C.E., Surveyor.
