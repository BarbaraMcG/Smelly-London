To the Chairman and Members of the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council. Madam Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, The year 1949 has passed without any serious epidemics in the area though there was a smallpox scare in June that started in a case which developed in a fireman in the s.s. "Mooltan." Six cases were reported subsequently in this country and I regret to say that they all died. The nearest case to us was in the Wembley area. Altogether there were eight contacts in this district who were kept under close supervision and none of them developed smallpox. One case of tetanus occurred in March in a child aged 3 years due to a fall on a mound of earth in Hillcrest Gardens, South Ruislip. I am glad to say the child eventually recovered. The Registrar-General's estimated population for mid-year 1949 again shows an increase of over a thousand, 64,270 to 66,010. The birth rate of 15.209 shows a decrease from the figure of 17.099 per 1,000 population for 1948. The death rate from all causes shows a slight decrease, namely 7.347 as compared with 7.686 per 1,000 population in 1948. Further particulars can be found in subsequent pages. Action under the Housing Act—Ruislip Almshouses, which were found to be in a very bad state of repair, have been partly reconditioned and made habitable. A wooden structure named "Springtime," Priors Gardens, South Ruislip, has been demolished, and demolition orders were made in respect of "Asp" and Poplar Cottages in Joel Street but owing to re-housing difficulties and shortage of building materials, no further action has actually been taken. A pamphlet entitled "Hints to Food Handlers" was distributed to all food retailers in the district and a Clean Food Guild was suggested but has not yet been instituted. Various complaints regarding dirty milk bottles and foreign objects in milk and bread were investigated and in one case it was 2 found necessary to prosecute a firm with regard to a cigarette end in a loaf of bread, this being the second or third complaint of a like nature. The prosecution was successful. In 1949 the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Middlesex County Council took over the control of the milk production at farms and dairies in the district. In June, at the request of the Borough of Wembley, a conference of all authorities supplied by the Colne Valley Water Company was held to inquire into the alleged excessive hardness of the water supplied in their districts. This was a useful conference at which the Colne Valley Water Company were represented and many opinions were expressed as to the possible ill-effects of this hard water. After some discussion and. the issue of a questionnaire to the Colne Valley Water Company it was decided that 110 useful purpose would be served in pursuing the matter any further at present. I hope, however, that this subject will be reconsidered again in the near future. Constant watch has been kept 011 open air swimming baths in the district and in the main the bacteriological tests have been satisfactory. A further report with regard to Ruislip Lido appears later. A large number of complaints were received with regard to wasps and hornets nests in the district and it was felt that the department would offer useful service by destroying these nests at a small charge. In all 169 nests were destroyed during the year. Three student sanitary inspectors were trained during the year under the Post War Training Scheme for Sanitary Inspectors arid thanks have been expressed by the training authorities for the facilities offered by this Council. The increasing work of the department as well as the increase in population in the district led to a review of the staff in October and it was decided by the Council to augment the staff by one additional Sanitary Inspector and one Senior Clerk. It is hoped that the work of the department, some of which was necessarily not receiving sufficient attention, will thus be brought up-to-date and still further improved. In conclusion I would like to stress the good work which has been undertaken by the sanitary, rodent and clerical personnel and to acknowledge once again my thanks to them for their continued conscientious application to their work. I am, Your obedient Servant, L. D. BAILEY, Medical Officer of Health. 3 Statistics ACREAGE OF THE DISTRICT Northwood Ward 1,979 acres Eastcote Ward 1,378 acres liuislip Ward 1,790 acres South Ruislip Ward 1,437 acres Total area of district 6,584 acres POPULATION The Registrar-General's estimate of the population for the mid-year:— 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 56,950 62,070 64,590 64,270 66,010 Number of Inhabited dwellings: 19,124.
