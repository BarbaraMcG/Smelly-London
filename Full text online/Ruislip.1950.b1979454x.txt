To the Chairman and Members of the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, During the year 1950 there has been no serious epidemic in the district except for a small outbreak of Paratyphoid Fever. An account of the Registrar-General's statistics will be found on pages 4 and 5. The Birth and Death Rates have been calculated upon the Registrar-General's estimated mid-1950 population of 67,090. The Table showing causes of death in 1950 (page 7) has been prepared using the new nomenclature introduced this year and a comparison with the 1949 Table (page 6) is therefore not facilitated. The position with regard to Tuberculosis will be found on page 8. Since the date of my 1949 report there have been two additions to the staff which have added greatly to the efficiency of the Department, namely, Mr. D. C. A. Bennie, Senior Clerk, and Mr. J. M. Stamp, Additional Sanitary Inspector. Nos. 1 and 2 Chestnut Cottages have been closed for human habitation and are now used only for storage purposes. Action under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, was contemplated in respect of one aged and infirm person, but I am pleased to report that removal to Redhill was secured on a voluntary basis. 2 Various complaints with regard to dirty milk bottles, foreign objects in bread, etc., were investigated, and in one case it was found necessary to take legal action against a firm with regard to a cigarette end in a loaf of bread. A conviction was obtained. Samples of drinking water were examined bacteriologically throughout the year and an account of these are given on a subsequent page. In addition, samples were also taken from school swimming baths, all of which were found to be satisfactory. No further action has been taken by the Colne Valley Water Company with regard to the hardness of the water in this district, the chemical constituency of which remained as in previous years. Further information is given on pages 21 and 22. Byelaws in respect of the Handling, Wrapping and Delivery of Food, Sale of Food in the Open Air, based on the model issued by the Ministry of Food, have been adopted by the Council. I should again like to place on record my sincere appreciation of all the hard work which has been undertaken by every member of the staff of this Department. I am, Your obedient Servant, L. D. BAILEY, Medical Officer of Health. 3 Statistics ACREAGE OF THE DISTRICT Northwood Ward 1,979 acres Eastcote Ward 1,378 acres Ruislip Ward 1,790 acres South Ruislip Ward 1,437 acres Total area of district 6,564 acres POPULATION The Registrar-General's estimate of the population for the mid-year:— 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 62,070 64,590 64,270 66,010 67,090 Number of Inhabited dwellings: 19,561.

FOOD POISONING During the latter part of April, 1950, there was an outbreak of Paratyphoid B (Type II) involving five persons in this district and eight persons in a neighbouring district.

Specimens from 44 contacts, samples of ice cream and drinking water together with samples of the cream and cracked shell egg in stock at the suspected bakery were obtained for laboratory examination, but the results were negative. Meanwhile attention was directed to the personnel of the bakery. After examination of specimens obtained from 16 members of the staff it was discovered that two bakers and one cleaner were carriers of these organisms. They were immediately admitted to hospital, kept under observation and specimens obtained from them at regular intervals.
