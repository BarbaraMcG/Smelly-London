Public Health Department, Town Hall, Walworth Road, S.E. Dear Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting for your consideration my twentyNinth Annual Eeport which deals with the vital statistics and general sanitary work of the Borough for the year 1915. The health of the inhabitants of the Borough, although the deathrate has slightly risen in the year under consideration, has been good. Scarlet fever which had been very prevalent in the two preceding years (1913-14) markedly declined. Measles at the end of the year showed an increased incidence. A scheme under the head of Maternity and Child Welfare has been submitted to the Council. The first part, viz.:—the establishment of branches has been carried out. The second part, the provision of a Centre, is awaiting the pleasure of the Council. The cleanly state of the Borough has declined since the war commenced, chiefly due to the diminution (40 per cent.) in the Male Inspectoral staff. The plea put forward by many landlords that workmen cannot be obtained to cleanse and repair houses is often made an excuse to avoid doing work, and is not always strictly accurate. The very strict examination of imported food-stuffs increased the work of the Pood Inspector, partly due to the immense quantities of food needed for the Army, and partly to the number of damaged cargoes landed at our wharves. Large quantities of unsound food have been destroyed. The work of the department in these difficult times, as far as I know, has been carried out without complaint. 1 have to thank the Council and Public Health Committee for their courtesy and support. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors. of the Borough of Southwark. 2 SUMMARY OF STATISTICS, 1915.

This must be apparent to the most casual observer. Ours is rather a careless working class population with little time for being dull and miserable. It is certainly not spoilt by luxury. If work be the remedy for all ills we ought to be a happy population. Complaints have been made from time to time of the increased dissolute habits of our people. This is true of a certain section, but the general behaviour of the population is free from any such reproach. War time always has been au opportunity for licence. It was so in the Napoleonic and the Crimean wars, and will be so in this to a far greater extent. We must all try to mitigate the sufferings of its victims, without unnecessary condemnation. Sad cases of distress in families have arisen through changed circumstances due to the war. Every one must feel the increased cost of living and taxation, which cannot be avoided.

The number ol' Births registered in the Borough during 1915 was 4,940, of which 2,452 were males, and 2,488 females. This represents a birth.rate of 27"5 per 1,000 inhabitants. The number of births registered in the individual parishes was as follows:—Newington, 3,002; St. George the Martyr, 1,428; Christchurch and St. Saviour's, 510. Of the 4,940 births registered iu the borough 49 were transferred away, the permanent residence of the parents being outside the borough. 356 births occurring in various lying.in and other institutions outside the borough, but belonging to Southwark parents, were notified to me by the Registrar.General. When the 4i? "outward " transfers are deducted and the 356 " inward " transfers are added to the 4,904 birihs actually registered in the borough the net amount of births belonging to Southwark for the year is found to be 5,247. This gives a corrected birth.rate of 29 2. Birth.rate for the last Twenty.five Years for the Three Divisions of the Borough as formerly existed. Newington.

These deaths in institutions comprised 609 belonging to Southwark and 667 to other sanitary districts. The number of inhabitants belonging to the Borough dying away from home—that is outside our boundaries in the various hospitals and infirmaries—was 1,333. Of this very large number, as many as 928 died in the Southwark Infirmary at Champion Hill. The remainder, with but few exceptions, died in the large public hospitals. When the 699 deaths of those persons who were non-parishioners, but who died in our Borough, have been deducted, and the 1,333 " outlying" deaths added, the actual or "corrected" number of deaths belonging to the sanitary area is found to be 3,727, of which number 1,966 were males and 1761 females. The death-rate when calculated on this "corrected" number is 20.8 per 1,000 inhabitants for the whole Borough for the year 1915, as against a rate of 17.8 for 1914. The percentage of persons dying away from Southwark in relation to the total number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 35'7. The various localities in which the "outlying" deaths occurred are shown in the following table. TABLE 3. Outlying Deaths, with Localities. Males. Females. Total.

The largely increased prevalence of Scarlet Fever which reached its height in the year 1914, marking the top of the cycle for that disease, has ceased in the year under consideration. It will be seen on reference to the table below that the sudden decline in the incidence of the disease was very remarkable during the year, 1915. In previous cycles the rise and fall in the numbers notified were marked by regular steps, but in this year the fall has been very sudden, almost from the top of the cycle to the bottom. In 1914 the top was reached, in 1915 it is nearly at the bottom. In former periods this result was only seen after some three years. There is nothing in particular to remark as to the character of the disease in 1915 except that the cases were of a very mild type throughout the Borough. The number of cases notified, as compared with London, during the last ten years was:— In Southwark. In London.

In the 11 cases treated at home, there was one death, a percentage of 9.1. It is our practice to spray the room with formalin and to strip the paper off the walls in the process of disinfection after Scarlet Fever. In the event of the room being verminous it is afterwards fumigated with sulphur. The annual death-rate per 1,000 was .06. DIPHTHERIA. During the last ten years this disease has steadily increased both in the number of cases notified and in the number of deaths. It is difficult to assign this to any particular cause. There is no record of exceptional house dampness or sewer floodings in any part of the borough, although much of the borough is low-lying. There is certainly a large increase in the number of families housed in ordinary premises. Some of the houses containing as many as five, six and seven families in each. All this tenement overcrowding must favour the spread of Diphtheria. The total number of cases notified including Membranous Croup, was 387, as against 338 for 1914. The deaths from the disease numbered 37, the same as last year. The percentage of deaths to the cases notified was 9.5. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.20.

The wards most affected were St. Peter, St. Michael, St. John, St. George and St. Mary. ENTERIC FEVER. The deaths from Enteric Fever in the borough during the year numbered 3, as against 2, 6 and 4, in the three preceding years. The total number of cases notified was 23 for the present year, and 24, 39 and 39, for the three preceding years. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.01.

The percentage of cases removed to hospital to the total number notified was 100.0. 57 The wards most affected were St. Paul and St. Peter. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.01. MEASLES. The deaths from Measles numbered in the year, 131. If the fatal eases are taken as 2½ per cent. of those affected there must have been upwards of 5,000 persons who suffered from this complaint. The actual number would be 5,240 or 14 per day. In the recent increased prevalence of the complaint chat number has been exceeded. The staff of one female inspector and a nurse set apart for this work is insufficient, that is. if every case is to be visited, instructions given, and the case revisited and nursed when necessary. Deaths from Measles during the last ten years:— 1906 95 1911 120 1907 112 1912 139 1908 77 1913 105 1909 127 1914 95 1910 225 1915 131 The annual death-rate per 1,000 living was 0.73. CEREBRO-SPINAL FEYER. During the year 25 cases of Cerebro-Spinal Fever were notified, of which 14 died. Also one case of Poliomyelitis which recovered. DIARRHÆA. The deaths from Diarrhæa and Enteritis, under 2 years of age, numbered 143. The year under consideration was not unfavourable for infants in regard to these complaints. The annual death-rate from Diarrhæa per 1,000 living was 0.97. Deaths from diarrhæa during the last ten years:— 1906 225 1911 331 1907 101 1912 95 1908 188 1913 205 1909 113 1914 207 1910 90 1915 148 58 WHOOPING COUGH. This disease for some years, as will be seen by the accompanying table has averaged 58 deaths in the year. No serious rise has occurred since 1907. The course of the complaint is a protracted one, and is very little influenced by Public Health measures. The deaths from this disease were 46 for the year. The annual death-rate per 1,000 living was 0.25. Deaths from Whooping Cough for the last ten years:— 1906 54 1911 64 1907 103 1912 49 1908 50 1913 38 1909 57 1914 59 1910 60 1915 46 HEALTH WORK.

To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, Maternity and Child Welfare and School for Mothers. The importance, especially at the present time, of preserving infant life and the health of mothers and young children is obvious. The terse question is often asked, can many of the infants who now die during the first year of life be saved and other children reared with a better chance of attaining a healthy adult age by anything a Local Authority can do? It would be a sad and distressing thing if the answer to such a vital question were not in the affirmative. The Local Government Board and its officers hold firmly the opinion that a Local Authority working on well established and judicious lines can do much in saving infant life. The Local Government Board has sketched out a plan which it declares will materially assist in the direction desired. Before referring to this plan I should like to state what is the present condition of our borough. The greater part of the Borough of Southwark is residential in character, and the population is chiefly a working-class one engaged in work away from the district, but coming home to sleep. The Borough of Southwark has been aptly described as the chief nursery of South London. The birth-rate is consequently high when compared with other Metropolitan Boroughs. In the last tabulated year (1914) 5,604 births were registered in the borough. The infant death-rate was 123 to every 1,000 births; that is to say that nearly one child in every eight born died under one year of age. This is a high rate of mortality. In comparison with the other twenty-eight Sanitary Authorities, Southwark stands twenty-fifth on the list, taking number one as the borough having the smallest infant death-rate: It has been authoritatively stated that no Authority should be satisfied if the infant death-rate exceeds 75 deaths in every 1,000 births annually. Huddersfield is a striking example of what can be done by a borough deeply interested in this subject. The scheme proposed by the Local Government Board can be brought into operation in the Borough of Southwark by a charge on the rates of only £120 a year. The entire scheme is now practically working 60 in Fulham and St. Pancras. The establishment consists of two parts, viz. (1) a Centre and (2) Branches: (l) A central establishment at which, in systematic classes, advice is given in the care and management of infants and little children up to school age; domestic and personal hygiene, home nursing, sewing and cooking. There will also be given at this centre medical and surgical advice to mothers, infants and children. It will be a kind of clearing house for patients, so that each sufferer can be directed to the hospital or dispensary best fitted to give the treatment needed. Further, it will be the co-ordinating centre of the work of the Branches and the welcome for mothers. It will be open daily except on Sundays. (2) The borough will be divided into districts or branches, some of them under voluntary and others under municipal control. The branches will undertake the home visiting of the mothers, infants and children. The whole borough will be divided into six districts, four of which will be under voluntary workers and two under municipal workers. The voluntary ones will be:— (a) The St. John's Branch in Larcom Street, attending to 1,232 infants annually in St. John's and St. Mary's Wards. (b) The Nelson Square Settlement, attending to 343 infants in St. Jude's Ward. (c) The prospective Walworth Branch, now being formed, ing to 1,093 infants in All Saints' and one half of St. George's Wards. (d) The Crossways Mission, attending to 799 infants in Trinity and one half of St. George's Wards. The Municipal Branches will be:— (e) The St. Michael's Branch, attending to 1,153 infants in St. Michael's, St. Saviour's and Christchurch Wards. (f) The St. Peter's Branch attending to 984 infants in St. Peter's and St. Paul's Wards. The children will be visited up to school age, which may be taken as four years. At the end of four years each branch will on an average 61 be visiting and keeping records of 4,000 children. It may also be taken that only one half of the infants born will require constant supervision. The actual number on the visiting list at any one time will therefore be 2,000, which we have always considered enough for one visitor to attend to. The position of the Central Home. I have visited various properties belonging to the Council, such as the two Public Baths, &c., and I am of opinion that they are unsuitable buildings for the Centre. I would advise premises being taken near the top of Borough Road (Stones End), as the position most suitable. I have calculated that the whole scheme can be efficiently carried out at an expense of £600 a year, half of which sum could be recovered from the Local Government Board and the Board of Education. I would advise also that you diminish the regular Sanitary (Male) Inspector Staff by one Inspector—an equivalent to £180 a year. This seems a fair arrangement when you are proposing to add to the Establishment two Nurses or Health Visitors for Home Nursing. Annual Cost of the Establishment.

On the report of the Public Health Committee the Council appointed three more health visitors. The question of the establishment of a Centre was postponed. 62 Report on the Work of the Health Visitor, Miss Reddoch. TABLE 33.

Notifications and Visiting.—Prom March 31st, 1915, to April 1st, 1916, 1,372 children have been visited in St. John's and St. Mary's Wards. Notifications were sent in by— The Public Health Department 585 The General Lying-in Hospital 159 St. Thomas's Hospital 118 Visitors 10 872 Added to these were 500 over a year old, with whom the Visitors keep in touch. The pre-natal cases number 277. Every baby whose birth is notified from the Public Health Office is seen by a trained Visitor three times during the year, on an average, the card records of the visits being kept. The "hospital" babies receive an average of eight visits during the year, voluntary visitors assisting. The expectant mothers are seen once or twice, or much oftener, according to the length of notice given and to the needs of the case. Daily visits are paid, if, and while there is urgency of any kind. The total number of visits to— Borough Council cases 1,755 Hospital cases 2,216 Pre-natal cases 554 Babies over one year (approx.) 1,000 5,525 1 - Number of first visits paid by salaried worker to homes of— (a) Expectant mothers 277 (b) Children 872 2—Total number of home visits paid by salaried worker to— (a) Expectant mothers 554 (b) Children 3,557 3—Number of visits paid to children by voluntary workers — (a) First visits 35 (b) Total 1,420 66 There is no class for expectant mothers. They come to the Centre, but no separate record of their attendance is kept, as most of the work in connection with them is individual and different in each case, and is most effectively carried out in the home visits. The Weighing Centre and Infant Consultations.—The babies are weighed every Monday afternoon at the Parish Room, Bedford Street, and Dr. Brook sees the children every alternate week. Number of children who attended during the year 93 Average attendance at the Centre 18 Total attendances do. 794 Number of times the Centre was open 45 It should also be noted that the babies born in York Road Hospital and in St. Thomas's Hospital, numbering 61, attend the weekly consultations held there, so that from this district 154 babies are regularly taken to be weighed, in addition to the 93 mentioned above, and are visited in their homes in the usual way from this Centre, the Hospital Clinic reporting to Walworth. Lectures.—Two courses, each of ten lectures, have been given on "Infant Care" and "The Care of Mothers and Children." Though the numbers were not large—27 and 23—the attendance was regular and the interest keen. Sanitary defects in the homes of mothers with babies have been reported to the Medical Officer of Health, and have always received attention. In this way much ill-health has been prevented, particularly in ante-natal cases. There has been no case of puerperal fever. The Local Government Board have granted half the expenses incurred by the Centre during the year, and the Committee propose to engage an Assistant Health Visitor in order that every home in St. John's and St. Mary's Ward in which a birth is notified may be visited. 67 TABLE 36.

Of this number 1,268 rooms were disinfected after the occurrence of the ordinary notifiable infectious diseases, as against 2,311 rooms in 1914. 5,093 periodical sprayings of rooms occupied by Phthisical patients were also carried out during the year. 725 verminous rooms were sulphured and otherwise cleansed by the Council's staff during the year, as against 1,292 in 1914. Among the total number of disinfections (7,086) it was found necessary to strip 648 rooms. Of these 375 were in relation to the notifiable diseases, 268 after the termination of cases of Phthisis, and 5 were verminous. TABLE 37. The Locality of Rooms Disinfected.

During the year 2669 persons were cleansed at the station in King James Street, as against 2.755 persons cleansed during the year 1914. Under our agreement with the London County Council, 2,601 children were cleansed, as against 2,662 cleansed during 1914. It was found necessary in a large number of cases to treat the children twice and sometimes three or four times before they were found to be effectually cleansed Many of the children treated were suffering from Scabies. In every case the treatment at our Station was thoroughly efficacious, and no recurrence of the trouble was experienced. 68 adults sent from the various common lodging houses and other places in our borough were cleansed during the year, as against 93 dealt with under the provisions of the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, in 1914. 72 TABLE 42.

GEORGE B. MILLSON, Town Hall, Southwark. Medical Officer of Health. 169 APPENDIX. ANNUAL REPORT of the TUBERCULOSIS OFFICER. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Southwark. Sib and Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in presenting my report on the work of the Tuberculosis Dispensary for the year 1915, the first complete year of our work in the new premises. These premises at 82 and 84, Newington Causeway, were opened for work on January 1st, 1915, and consist of waiting hall, office and dispensary on the ground floor, on the first floor nurses' offices, lavatory, two dressing rooms and consulting room with doctor's office, and above that, accommodation for the caretaker. The floors are covered with a fireproof material which is impervious to dust and germs, and can be highly polished with "Eonuk," no corners to harbour dust or germs exist, but all the floors are rounded off as they meet the walls, and everything possible is done to lessen the chance of harbouring infection. The alterations were carried out under the direction of the Borough Engineer, and the building is admirably adapted for the purposes. The staff at present consist of the Tuberculosis Officer, secretarydispenser (holding the combined post), two nurses and a caretaker and for daughter. The work is expanding so rapidly in all directions that the staff is kept working hard in order to keep pace with it. In 1915 there were 1,575 cases examined for the first time, these consisted of the following:— 170 TABLE A. Insured Persons 474 (Males 323, Females 151) Non-Insured Persons 209 (Males 22, Females 187). Children under 16 years 892 Total 1,575 Of these examined 30 7 per cent, were found to be suffering from some form Tuberculosis as is shown in Table B. TABLE B. Suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption):— Insured Persons 266 (Males 198, Females, 68). Non-Insured Persons 76 (Males 9, Females 67). Children under 16 years 47 Total 389 TABLE C. Suffering from Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis (glands, joints, &c.): — Insured Males 6 „ Females 4 Non-Insured Males 2 ,, Females ... 4 Children under 16 years 80 Total 96 giving a total of 485 suffering from some form of Tuberculosis; approximately 30 per cent, of the cases examined for the first time. The number of cases sent up for examination and consultation by doctors has largely increased, and the Dispensary has been of great service to them in dealing with their cases. During the year the London County Council undertook to provide, as far as possible, treatment in institutions for the non-insured persons, both children and adults, on lines somewhat resembling those of the 171 London Insurance Committee, consequently we have been able to obtain treatment in sanatoria and hospitals for a considerable number of noninsured persons. TABLE D. Non-insured persons dealt with by the London County Council:— Admitted to Sanatorium 50 „ Hospital 11 „ Open Air School 1 Becommended to attend Dispensary 3 Transferred to Camberwell 2 Total 67 The London County Council Health Department requests reports to be sent periodically on the progress of those whom they have sent away, and the same are obtained for all cases at the Dispensary who have been treated at or in connection with it; these cases are kept, when the disease is arrested, under supervision. By this means the Tuberculosis Ofiicer keeps the old patients under observation and also frequently finds out changes of addresses. The number of cases who move away leaving no trace is very large, and as they obviously infect fresh dwellings, every effort is made to find their destination, but frequently without result, many of them having removed either to the country, or to some distant part of London, while others have joined the Army. Insured Persons dealt with under the head of Sanatorium Benefit. There is still much misapprehension, even among practitioners, as to the meaning of the term Sanatorium Benefit; this being frequently taken as equivalent to Sanatorium Treatment, whereas Sanatorium Benefit, as defined by the Act, includes four alternatives :— 1. Sanatorium Treatment. 2. Hospital Treatment. 3. Treatment at Dispensary. 4. Domiciliary Treatment under the Panel Practitioner. A total of 258 cases were reported on to the Insurance Committee and recommendations forwarded as to suitable treatment. The recommendations were granted in practically all the cases. 172 TABLE E. Eecommended for:— Sanatorium Treatment 188 Hospital Treatment 41 Domiciliary Treatment 24 Dispensary Treatment 3 Reported on 2 Total 258 The outdoor visits of the Nurses numbered 2,585, and patients were advised as to the disposal of sputum, the arrangements and ventilation of their rooms, the sleeping arrangements of the patients, and the advisibility of having contacts examined. The latter is a most important part of their work and they have been very successful in persuading contacts to attend for examination. All cases where the conditions are bad are frequently re-visited and a gradual improvement effected, where it cannot be done at once. A great deal of very good preventative work has been effected by this means, and much has been done by the Nurses' visits to prevent the spread of infection and to teach the patients as to taking precautions by distributing cards of instructions to them and giving them bottles for their sputum, which they are taught to use and keep clean, with the object of preventing the indiscriminate spitting which is the chief cause of the dissemination of the disease. Where necessary, the sleeping arrangements are altered, though, where families are large and rooms few, it is frequently difficult to isolate a patient satisfactorily. On the whole, however, considering the difficulties the Nurses have to contend with, we have made fair progress in this direction. 110 sputum flasks were distributed to patients during the twelve months. TABLE F. Nurses' Visits—Non-Insured Persons 1,245 ,, ,, Insured Persons 1,240 Total 2,585 The total attendances at the Dispensary has largely increased and during the year 1915 amounted to a total of 5,268. 173 Most of these attendances are of cases under a regular course of treatment, either tuberculin or medicinal, the others are of cases examined for the first time. TABLE G. Attendances of Insured Persons 2,783 ,, Non-Insured Persons 2,485 Total 5,268 During the year 306 reports on cases were sent to the public authorities, and 506 reports to practitioners on cases sent by them, with suggestions as to the best course of treatment to adopt. Eleven cases were referred to general hospitals for operations where surgical treatment was necessary. In regard to sputum examination there is still a great tendency to wait until the bacilli are found before making a diagnosis of consumption, by which much valuable time is lost, and the stage in which cure is possible slips by. Valuable as the finding of bacilli is, by the time they appear in the sputum the disease has got a firm footing, hence the value of an earlier diagnosis from physical signs and symptoms. In many cases the examination has already been made when the patient first comes, but in 70 doubtful cases the sputum was examined by the Borough Analyst, who found bacilli present in 20 cases, a proportion of 25 5 per cent., and was able to definitely verify the diagnosis.

Still under treatment, March 31st, 1316— Non-Insured 135 Insured 168 Total 303 Deaths during the year of Patients on the Dispensary Register— Non-Insured 12 Insured 79 Total 91 The influence of the war during the year was not particularly noticeable, excepting the fact that the high prices of food made it difficult for patients to get the extra nourishment that in many cases was needed, though in other cases of recently-married girls suffering from tuberculosis 175 the separation allowance, and the fact that they had no longer to work in factories or at any other tiring business, gave them a much better chance of recovery than they would have had otherwise. In conclusion, I wish to express my appreciation of the co-operation of the Medical Officer of Health and members of the Public Health Department, the charitable societies, hospital staffs and others with whom my work has brought me in contact, and my thanks to my own staff for the ungrudging and hard work they have put in in order to accomplish what has been done during the past year. I am, Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HORACE WILSON, Tuberculosis Officer. Southwark Tuberculosis Dispensary, 82-84, Newington Causeway, S.E.
