LAMI THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF LAMBETH THE ANNUAL REPORT on Vital and Sanitary Statistics, 1893, by H. WALTER VERDON, M.D., F.R.C.S., Medical Officer of Health, Barrister-at-Law, Member of the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple. TO THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF LAMBETH, 1893. THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Being a Report for the Year 1893 on the Vital and Sanitary Statistics of the Parish of Lambeth. In pursuance of the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 25 and 26 Vict., Cap. 102, Sec. 43, I herewith lay before your Vestry a Report for the year 1893, upon the Vital and Sanitary Statistics of the Parish of Lambeth. The population of the Parish of Lambeth, estimated in the month of June, 1893, is represented by 279,924 persons. The calculation is based on the ratio of increase observed in the period of ten years intervening between the last census and the preceding one. The annual increment thus determined is 0.85 per cent. Comparing this estimate with the result of a calculation based on the number of inhabited houses, there is no material difference in the figures. 4 The growth, it will be observed, took place in the southern quarter of the Parish, and is limited to the four Outer subdistricts. On the other hand, the Inner sub-districts remained stationary in numbers, or recorded a decline. As no increase between 1881 and 1891 appears on the census returns in the populations of the Waterloo Road sub-districts, or even in those of Lambeth Church, no increase can be admitted in the estimates of the present year. The figures of 1893 must remain as they were in 1891. The following table represents the approximate populations of the registration sub-districts :— Inner Sub-Districts— 1881 1891 1893 Waterloo Road, 1st 15191 14031 14031 Waterloo Road, 2nd 16351 14644 14644 Lambeth Church, 1st 19876 18023 18024 Lambeth Church, 2nd 39859 39147 39147 Outer Sub-Districts— Kennington, 1st 45232 50586 51871 Kennington, 2nd 35332 39708 40729 Brixton 62837 73405 75099 Norwood 19017 25657 26379 Inhabitated houses, populaton, and rated householders distributed in Wards census vear 1891:- Inhabited Houses.

The houses of Lambeth number 37,680, standing on 3,941 statute acres, averaging for the whole district 9.5 houses per acre. In the most crowded part —that is, in the sub-district of Waterloo 1st—there are thirty houses per acre; whilst in the open neighbourhood of Norwood there are more than two houses per acre, but less than three.

A number amounting to about one-twelfth of the population, or in exact figures 22,674, are the occupants of single-room tenements. 38,395 persons live in tenements of two rooms, 41,959 in tenements of three rooms, while 40,696 persons inhabit four room tenements in houses jointly occupied by two families or more. The tenements in Lambeth being holdings of less than five rooms number 40,472. Of these 10,837 are single-room tenements, and 4,305 give residence to a single occupant; 3,412 to two persons, 1690 to three persons, 887 to four persons, and 543 to five persons and over. There are 11,485 two-roomed tenements ; 1,318 of these are occupied by a single person, 3,129 by two persons, 2,463 by three persons, 1,911 by four persons, 1,253 by five persons, and 1,411 by six persons and over. 10,043 are tenements of three rooms ; 375 are occupied by a single person, 1,987 by two people, 1,960 by three persons, 1,740 by four persons, 1,501 by five persons, 1,068 by six persons. The four-roomed tenements number 8,127; 134 are occupied by a single person, 873 by two persons, 1,305 by three persons, 1,396 by four persons, 1,309 by five persons, 1,070 by six persons, 854 by seven persons, 615 by eight persons, 301 by nine persons, and 270 by ten persons or more. Nuisances from Sewers. In the month of April the Sewers and Sanitary Committee, having taken into its consideration at some length the question of the prevention of nuisances arising from sewers, formulated a scheme dealing with the construction, interception, ventilation, and flushing of sewers. The subject, in the form of a recommendation from the Committee, was further considered by the Vestry at a meeting held on the 20th of the same month, and formally adopted. 7 Report of the Committee appointed to consider the question of Sewer Ventilation. The Committee is of opinion that the question of sewer ventilation cannot be considered apart from the much wider subject of the prevention of nuisance arising from sewers. The Committee recognises the fact that the Metropolitan Board of Works conducted an enquiry extending over many years, with the object of discovering some agent or appliance that should be effective in so altering the constituent elements of sewer gas as to remove the danger to health resulting from its presence in streets and houses. Chemicals for the decomposition, neutralization or absorption of gases had been placed on trays at the inlet, the outlet, and in the channel of sewers. Chlorine generators had been hung in the mains. Draft producers and foul air consumers by an ingenious contrivance had been connected with street lamps. Although the methods tried were numerous, and the experiments exhaustive, the Metropolitan Board of Works had been unable to recommend the adoption of of any of them as of practical value. The Committee considers it useless to pursue an enquiry into methods which already have been the subjects of experiment conducted by able experts employed by the Board of Works, and with results so unsatisfactory ; and it considers that attention should be directed rather to the removal of the cause than to the treatment of the nuisance when it has already arisen. In examining into the nature of the cause, the following facts were under notice : (1) Fermentative changes, leading to decomposition, and the disengagement of gases are the causes of nuisances in connexion with sewers. (2) Decomposition is not usually observable in sewage as it enters the sewer, consequently this change may be regarded as taking place in the sewer. (3) Fermentative changes in fresh sewage are hastened by its admixture with stale sewage—by stagnation, and by the presence of foul and heati d air. They, on 8 the other hand, are retarded by the admission of fresh air, by the existence of a low temperature, by the addition of water, and by the movements resulting from rapid transit. The Committee is of opinion that the removal of sewage beyond the confines of the Parish before decomposition is to any large extent established, and therefore before it is in a condition to cause nuisance, is within the scope of a properly directed effort, provided that (а) Means be provided for the better cleansing of sewers, so as to secure the removal of all residual matter, including debris and incrustation. (б) Means be provided for securing a plentiful supply of fresh air to all parts of the sewer. In regard to the cleansing of the sewers the Committee is of opinion that a system of flashing should be adopted either by the construction of tanks at the terminals that should be subject to automatic discharge, or by hose. That in new sewers the question of their maintenance in a cleanly condition, free from deposit and incrustation, should especially be taken into consideration at the time of their construction. And it recommends the provision of inspection chambers at suitable places, and the provision of flushing tanks ; it also recommends, having in view the necessity for a plentiful supply of fresh air in the sewers, the provision of ventilation gratings in the roadway placed at short intervals apart, and shafts placed in such positions as may be found expedient, and when permission be obtained from the owners of property. The Committee further recommend that before its proposals be put into general practice, an experiment be made upon a section of the system confined to one tributary of the main sewer. That this section should be intercepted from the main sewer during the course of the experiments, in order that the results of the experiments be not affected by gases evolved in other parts of the sewer system, and that upon this section the Surveyor be empowered to carry out the recommendations of this report. 9 THE BIRTH RATE. The number of births registered in Lambeth during the year 1893 reaches a total of 9222 cases, 4 less than the number registered in 1892. The number of male children exceeds by 18 that of female. During the year in the entire Metropolitan area 132,975 births are recorded : 67,685 males and 65,290 females. The table shows the number of births registered in each year for the last ten years : Year. No. of Births. Year.

In this computation parishioners dying in public Institutions of all characters, and denominations situated outside the boundaries of Lambeth are included. But non-parishioners dying in public Institutions situated within the boundaries are excluded. Calculated for the year the death rate of Lambeth is 20.3 per 1,000. The Metropolitan Rate tor the same period being 21.3 per 1,000. In the Metropolis the registered deaths numbered 91,536; of these 46,853 were males, and 44,683 were females.

Deaths from the principal Zymotic diseases registered in Lambeth and properly belonging thereto number 760. In this computation parishioners dying in public institutions situated outside the boundaries of Lambeth, being chiefly the hospitals of the Asylums Board, are included, while non-parishioners dying in public institutions situated within the boundaries are excluded. Calculated for the year, the Zymotic death rate of Lambeth is 27 per 1,000, the Metropolitan rate for the same period being 3.05 per 1,000. During the year 1893, under the Notification Clauses of the Public Health Act, 4,107 cases of infectious disease have been reported. Of this number 945 were removed to the Hospitals of the Asylums Board, and 3,102 remained under medical treatment at their own homes. In accordance with the resolution of the Vestry, a Sanitary Inspection was made and the drain test applied in every infected house. The infected houses numbered 3,179, two or more cases occasionally occurring under the same roof. The sanitary defects discovered are grouped under two headings; under the first is found a list of such defects as are referable to the condition of traps, fittings, and appliances. The second has special reference to the drains lying underground and to the soil pipes. 1,641 houses are reported as subject to nuisances arising from defects classed under one or both headings. In 658 houses faults in connection with the drains permitted the escape of sewage or sewer gas. But in all, defects were observed in the traps, fittings, and appliances. The existence of Scarlet Fever was notified in 1752 houses, and sanitary defects were discovered in 901. Diphtheria made its appearance in 603 houses, and sanitary defects were discovered in 344. Typhoid Fever caused an examination to be made in 137 houses, and sanitary defects were discovered in 72. Erysipelas invaded 437 houses, and sanitary defects were discovered in 211. Continued Fever was reported as present in 58 houses, and sanitary defects were discovered in 26. Croupappeared in 49 houses,and sanitary defects were discovered in 20. Small Pox infected 79 houses, and sanitary defects were discovered in 12. Diarrhoea having been notified under the designation of Cholera, attracted the attention of the Inspectors to 22 houses, 8 of which were the subjects of sanitary defects. Three houses were reported as being infected with Typhus, and one house with Asiatic Cholera. LAmI 19 During the year 99 cases of Small Pox were certified as occurring in the Parish of Lambeth. 86 cases were removed for treatment to the Hospital and 13 cases remained under treatment at home. Five deaths were reported from this disease. In the Metropolis 206 deaths occurred. Sub-Districts. Estimated Population. Total No. of Cases Notified Cases Treated at Home. Cases removed to Hospital.
