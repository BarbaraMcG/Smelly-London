Fue 6 Vestry of the parish of Fulham. Annual Report OF THE medical Officer of Health, J. CHARLES JACKSON. For the Year ending December 30th, 1899. Town Hall, Fulham, S.W. To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report on the vital statistics and the conditions affecting the health of the district for the year 1899. The statistics of Marriages, Births, Deaths and Infectious Diseases relate to the 52 weeks ending December 30th, 1899. POPULATION. The population of Fulham as enumerated at the Census taken on March 29th, 1896, was 113,781, having increased from 91,640 during the previous five years. The population in the middle of 1899 as estimated on the hypothesis that the rates of increase which prevailed between 1891 and 1896 have been maintained since, was 130,720, and on these figures the statistics in this report are based. The following table shows the increase in population of the district during the last 38 years :— Year. Population. No. of Houses. Persons to the Acre. 1861 Census 2,5 8 3 9.1 15,539 13.7 1871 „ 2 3,378 3,909 6,685 1881 „ 42,900 25.2 1891 „ 91,640 12,866 53.9 1896 „ 113,7 81 15,266 67.0 1899 Estimated 76.9 130,720 17,515 In view of the rapid increase of the population, the acquirement of additional open spaces should engage the immediate attention of the local authority before all the available land is absorbed by builders. Fulham has only about 50 acres of open spaces, a meagre allowance for a prospective population of at least 170,000. AGE AND SEX DISTRIBUTION. The following Table gives the estimated number of persons living in Fulham at different ages, assuming the age constitution of the district to be the same as in 1891, no particulars of age having been required to be given at the Census of 1896 : — Under 5 years 18,432 5 to 15 29,412 15 „ 25 22,484 25 „ 35 23,530 35 „ 45 16,602 45 „ 55 10,195 55 „ 6 5 5 ,882 6 5 „ 75 3,137 Over 75 1,046 130,720 Assuming the proportion of males to females to be the same as in 1896, there are 61,752 males and 68,968 females. MARRIAGES AND MARRIAGE RATE. 1,153 marriages were solemnized in Fulham during the year, compared with 916, 1,028. and 1,095 in the three previous years. The marriage rate, i.e., persons married per 1,000 inhabitants, was 18.4, the rate for the Metropolis being 18,4, and that for England and Wales 16,3. BIRTHS AND BIRTH RATE. The births registered during the year numbered 4,574, 2,350 males and 2,224 females. There was one birth to every 28.3 inhabitants, and 100 births of males to 94.7 females. The 4.574 births were equal to an annual rate per 1,000 living of 35.0, being slightly in excess of that recorded in the three previous ears. The birth rate of the Metropolis was 29.4, and in the three adjoining parishes the rates were : Kensington 20.8, Hammersmith 28.2, and Chelsea 24.7. In the other sanitary districts the rates ranged from 12.2 in St. Martin-in-the-Fields, 14.9 in the, City of London, and 16.7 in St. George, Hanover Square, to 37.7 in Mile End, 42.7 in St. Georgein-the-East, and 44.4 in St. Luke. Among the 32 large provincial towns the lowest rates were 23.0 in Huddersfield, 23.1 in Halifax, and 23.4 in Bradford; the highest rates were 35.6 in Liverpool, 35.7 in Sunderland, and 36.6 in Gateshead ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN. The births of illegitimate children numbered 191 —101 males and 90 females—forming 4.2 per cent, of the total births. STILL-BORN CHILDREN. 185 still-born children were buried in Fulham Cemetery, being in the proportion of one still-born child to every 24.7 living. The following Table gives the number of births registered in Fulham, together with the birth rate during the previous 10 years. Males. Females Total. Birth-Rate. 1889 1567 3089 37.2 1522 1593 1890 3144 35.7 1551 1891 1814 1733 37.4 3547 1892 1761 3596 35.4 1835 1893 1851 1860 3711 35.4 1894 1826 3763 1937 34.9 1895 1937 3930 35.3 1993 1896 1976 4068 34.8 2092 1897 1979 4106 34.2 2127 1898 2116 4307 34.4 2191 1899 5474 35 .0 2350 2224 EXCESS OF BIRTHS OVER DEATHS. The natural increase of the population by the excess of births over deaths was 2,079, compared with 2,025, 2,076, and 2,139 in the three preceding years. DEATHS AND DEATH RATE. The deaths of 2,714 persons—1,388 males and 1,326 females — were registered in Fulham during the year, but of these 452—235 males and 217 females—were of persons not belonging to the district who died in public institutions within the parish, while the deaths of 235 persons belonging to Fulham occurred outside the district, chiefly in various public institutions. There were, therefore, 2,497 deaths of parishioners of Fulham, the mortality being at the rate of 19.1 per thousand for the year, the rate for males being 20.9, and for females 17.5 The death rate of the whole of London was 19.3, and of the three adjoining parishes, that of Kensington was 17.7, of Hammersmith 19.0, and of Chelsea 19.6. The lowest rates in the 43 sanitary districts into which the Metropolis is divided were 11.6 in Hampstead, 12.7 in Stoke Newington, 14.2 in St. George, Hanover Square, and 14.3 in Plumstead, and the highest rates were 25.6 in Limehouse, 27.1 in St. George-in-the-East, 27.7 in St. George the Martyr, and 28.4 in St. Luke. Among the 32 large towns in England and Wales the lowest rates were those of Croydon 15.0, Cardiff 15.4, Hudders field 16.2, and Derby 16.9; and the highest those of Sheffield 22.2, Preston Salford 23.8, Manchester 24.6, and Liverpool 26.4 CORRECTION FOR AGE AND SEX DISTRIBUTION. In comparing the death-rates of different areas, it is necessary to take into consideration the age and sex distribution of the several populations, and to correct the recorded crude death-rates by the proper factor. Corrected in this way the death-rates of Fulham, the adjoining parishes and London, were: — Crude Death Rate. Corrected Death Rate.

Of the 2.497 deaths registered 862 or 34.6 per cent, were those of infants under the age of one year, and the rate of infant mortality, measured by the proportion of deaths under one year, to births registered, was equal to 189 per 1,000, and exceeded by 20 the mean rate in the preceding 6 years. The corresponding rate of the County of London was 166 per 1,000, the rates in the various sanitary districts ranging from 103 in Stoke Newington, 112 in St. Giles, and 124 in St. Marylebone, to 207 in Westminster, 216 in Limehouse and 226 in Holborn. In the 32 large provincial towns the rate was 181 per 1,000, the lowest proportions being 152 in Huddersfield, 154 in Croydon, and 159 in Halifax; the highest proportions were 210 in Nottingham, 255 in Preston, and 269 in Burnley. DEATHS OF ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN. 85 of the children who died before attaining the age of one year were illegitimate, the mortality among them being in the proportion of 445 deaths to 1,000 births, or morel than twice as heavy as that of children born in wedlock. The following Table gives the infantile mortality in Fulham, London, and the adjoining parishes for the preceding six years: — Deaths under One Year per 1,000 Births.

These deaths were equal to an annual rate of 65.6 per 1,000 of the population estimated to be living at that age, the corresponding rate for the Metropolis being 61.2. During the previous 6 years the mean death-rate of children under 5 years has been in Fulham 62.2, and in London 68.7. INSURANCE OF INFANTS. Certificates under the Friendly Societies Acts were issued in respect, of 596 children under the age of 5 years, and 70 in respect of those between 5 and 10, 52 per cent of the children dying at these ages being insured. MORTALITY AT SCHOOL AGE At the age of 5 to 15 years, which is approximately the school period of life, there were 109 deaths, being equal to an annual rate of 3.7 per 1.000 of those estimated to be living at that age. MORTALITY AT ADOLESCENCE Between the ages of 15 and 25 years, 85 deaths were recorded, the rate of mortality lining 3.8 per 1,000. MORTALITY AT MATURITY. Between the ages of 25 and 65 years there were 740 deaths, corresponding to a death-rate of 13.2. MORTALITY AT DECLINE. At the age of 65 years and upwards, 357 persons died, the deathrate at this age period being 83.4. DISTRIBUTION OF DEATHS. The following Table gives the number of deaths at different ages, together with the Death-rate for all ages in each of the Wards into which the parish is divided: — Mortality from all.

In the various sanitary areas of the Metropolis the zymotic death-rates ranged from 1.07 in St. Martin-in-the-Fields, 1.09 in St. George, Hanover Square, and 1.12 in St. James, Westminster, to 3.67 in Newington, 3.78 in Limehouse, and 4.53 in St. George, Southwark. In the 32 large towns the zymotic death-rate averaged 3.02, ranging from 1.50 in Halifax, 1.56 in Croydon, and 1.62 in Derby, to 4.32 in Salford, 4.35 in Burnley, and 4.39 in Sheffield. During the past 10 years the deaths and death-rates from these diseases in Fulham have been as under :— Year. Deaths. Death-rate. 1889 243 2.9 1890 379 4.3 1891 211 2.3 1892 448 4.6 1893 344 3.3 1894 426 4.0 1895 345 3.1 1896 4 22 3.6 1897 3 60 3.0 1898 39 6 3.16 1899 423 3.24 The mean rate for the 10 years 1889 to 1898 being 3.12. COMPARATIVE MORTALITY FROM ZYMOTIC DISEASES IN FULHAM, LONDON AND THE THREE ADJOINING DISTRICTS. The following Table shows the mortality from Zymotic diseases in Fulham as compared with London and the three adjacent parishes : Disease. Actual number of deaths in Fulham. Fulham's proportion if mortality was the same as in 3 adjoining Western districts,viz., Hammersmith, Chelsea and Kensington. Fulham's proportion if mortality was the same as in London.

In Fulham 36.6 per cent, of the population are under the age of 15 years, whereas in London and the other three districts under consideration the respective proportions are 32.4 and 30.1 per cent. NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. The following table gives the number of cases of infectious diseases notified in Fulham since 1890, when compulsory notification came into force, excluding duplicate notifications: — 1890 1891 1892 18 93 1894 1895 1898 1899 1896 1897 Smallpox - - 3 3 2 40 2 2 - - 1 Scarlet Fever 286 118 627 811 847 5 1 7 701 529 339 759 Diphtheria 70 69 96 230 368 341 378 4 6 5 514 3 2 9 Membranous Croup 23 13 15 20 13 18 14 10 11 14 Enteric Fever 53 72 - - - 51 41 58 37 57 53 111 7 1 Continued Fever 6 2 3 5 5 1 1 Typhus Fever 1 - - - - - - 2 3 - Cholera - - - 5 - - 2 1 - 4 Puerperal Fever 6 18 6 6 10 10 6 14 8 13 Erysipelas 114 6 7 153 178 104 113 94 99 1 34 121 Totals 573 1073 887 1149 1354 1488 3 2 7 786 1224 1683 SMALLPOX. The case of Smallpox notified was an imported one, the patient having only been in Fulham for two days prior to his removal to hospital. SCARLET FEVER For the third successive year Scarlet Fever was more prevalent in Fulham than in the adjoining parishes and London, and on reference to Table H it will be seen that the incidence-rate of the disease in Fulham was exceeded by only three of the Sanitary Districts of the Metropolis, there being 847 cases notified, or 6.5 per 1,000 inhabitants. The following table gives the number of cases notified per 1,000 of the population in Fulham, the three adjoining Parishes and London in 1898 and the eight previous years: — 1890 1891 1892 18 94 1895 1896 1 897 1898 Average for Eight Wars. 1890-1898 1893 Fulham 3.4 1 .3 5.5 6.8 4.9 3.0 5.4 6.3 5.6 2.3 1 .9 4.3 2.3 6.0 Kensington 3.1 4.4 Hammersmith 4.6 6.7 3.6 3 .6 2.3 3.2 5.1 3.7 6.5 5.7 3.3 5.0 3 .1 4.8 3.6 4.1 4.4 4.9 2.0 6.6 4.1 Chelsea Home 3.7 6.4 4.5 5.8 6.5 2.8 4.3 3.5 3.8 8.6 4.3 2.7 London 5.1 The distribution of the cases in the several Wards of the parish was as under: — Cases.

Mortality. —The fatality of the disease was somewhat less than last year, there being 33 deaths, representing a case mortality of 3.9 per cent., compared with 4.3 per cent, in 1898. Of the 692 patients removed to hospital 31 or 4.5 per cent., and of the 155 treated at home 2. or 1,3 percent, died. Return Cases. — In 10 instances the disease occurred within 10 days of the return of a child living in the same house from one of the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals, after recovery from a similar attack. DIPHTHERIA. There was again an increase in the prevalence of this disease in Fulham, 514 cases of Diphtheria and 14 of Membranous Croup, which is identical with Laryngeal Diphtheria; the incidence-rate being 4.0 per 1,000, compared with 3.0, 3.2, and 3.8 in the three preceding years. The distribution of the cases in the several Wards of the parish was as under : — No. of cases. Cases per 1000 of the population. Deaths. Death-rate per 1,000. Barons Court Ward 0.39 33 5 2.6 Hurlingham 29 76 5 .1 3 0.53 Lillie 3.6 7 0.33 Margravine 84 4 .1 9 0.44 Munster 96 4.9 17 0.86 Sands End 104 4.9 8 0.37 Town 42 2 3.5 0.67 Walham 8 64 4.0 0.50 4.0 59 528 0.45 Mortality. —Although the number of cases notified was the highest recorded, the fatality was lower than in any year since 1892, thera being 59 deaths from the disease, giving a case mortality of 11.2 per cent., compared with 31.6 per cent, in 1894, 20.0 per cent. in 1895, 22.0 per cent, in 1896, 16.3 per cent, in 1897, and 12.8 per cent, in 1898. Of the 431 patients removed to hospital, 43 or 10 per cent., and of the 97 treated at home 16 or 16.5 per cent., died. The following table shows the fatality at different age periods, of the cases treated at home and of those removed to hospital: — Age. Cases removed to Hospital. Crises treated at home. No. of Cases Deaths. Mortality per cent. No. of Cases Deaths. Mortality per cent. 0—1 5 1 20.0 2 100.0 2 1—2 3 3 100.0 17 7 41.2 2—3 6.0 8 37.5 34 2 3 7 52 13.5 3—4 4 - - 4 50.0 4—5 67 8 8 12.0 5-10 45 4 9.9 16 159 10.0 1 10—15 - - 40 2.5 9 15-25 - - 6 - - 20 8 2 5—35 - - 1 27 3.7 35—45 - - 10 4 - - Total 431 43 10.0 97 16 16.5 It will be seen from the above that the difference in the fatality of hospital and home cases is especially marked in children under 5, the case mortality of the former being 12.3 and of the latter 22.9 per cent. There is no doubt that if the nature of the disease were more promptly recognised, and cases treated in the earliest stages with antitoxic serum, the fatality from Diphtheria would be still further lessened. DIPHTHERIA AND PRIMARY SCHOOLS.

CLOSURE OF SCHOOLS. In consequence of the prevalence of Diphtheria among the children attending the Infants' Department of the Ackmar Road Board School during the end of February and beginning of March, at the request of the Sanitary Authority the Department was dosed from March 6th to March 27th. In October a number of cases occurred among the children attending Class A of the Intants' Department of Star Road Board School, and that Class was closed from October 24th to November 10th, and the children living in the same houses as the children attending that Class were also excluded. COMPARATIVE PREVALENCE OF DIPHTHERIA IN FULHAM. In London there was an increase of Diphtheria in 1899, 13692 cases being notified, against 11,561 in 1898. The disease showed the highest proportional prevalence in Cam berwell, St. Saviour, Lewisham, Newington, Bermondsey and St. George, Southwark, in which districts the case-rates were higher than that of Fulham, and in 15 districts the disease was more fatal than in Fulham. The comparative prevalence and fatality of Diphtheria, during recent years, in Fulham, the adjoining parishes and London, will be seen from the two following tallies, which give the rates of incidence and mortality of the disease in the several localites: — Cases notified per 1,000 Inhabitants. 1895 1896 1897 1898 Average for 9 years 1890 to 1898 1899 1890 1891 18 9 2 1893 1894 3.1 3.2 2.4 4.0 Fulham 1.1 0.7 1.0 3.4 3.0 3.8 2.2 1.6 2.1 1.9 1.1 1.0 2.2 1.2 1.1 Kensington 1.4 2.1 1.5 2.7 1.7 1.8 Hammersmith 2.9 2.1 1.5 1.5 2.2 1.8 2.3 2.7 3.6 Chelsea (Home District) 2.2 5.7 2.2 2.8 3 .2 2.0 3.0 2.5 2.3 2.7 1.9 2.4 2.5 3.1 3.0 2.6 London 1.4 2.3 3.0 1.5 3.0 Deaths from Diphtheria per 1,000 Inhabitants. 1898 Average for to years 1889-1898 1889 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1895 1897 0.15 0.49 Fulham 0.25 0.3 2 0.63 0.99 0.70 0.52 0.49 0.66 0.21 Kensington . 0.53 0.47 0.15 0.20 0.40 0.67 0.17 0.20 0.49 0.46 0.38 Hammersmith 0.28 0.51 0.43 0.49 0.49 0.75 0.74 0.53 0.49 0.21 0.49 Chelsea 0.58 0.41 0.56 0.59 1.17 0.56 0.43 0.25 0.17 0.54 0.52 London 0.61 0.39 0.38 0.33 0.32 0.44 0.75 0.52 0.59 0.59 0.48 Return Cases.—In 5 instances the disease occurred within 10 days of the return of a patient living in the same house from one of the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals after recovery from a similar attack. In each instance the Diphtheria bacillus was discovered in the nasal secretion of the returned patient. The occasional persistence of the infectiousness of the disease is illustrated by the following case: — A child was admitted into the Fountain Fever Hospital on June 15th, suffering from Scarlet Fever, while there had a mild attack of post-scarlatinal Diphtheria, was discharged about the middle of August, and went to Leytonstone for a month, returning home to Fulham in the middle of September. A fortnight after her return the mother contracted Diphtheria, and was removed on October 2nd to the hospital. The child then went back to Leytonstone, returned to Fulham on October 16th, slept for three nights with her father, who was notified on October 23rd as suffering from Diphtheria, and was removed to the hospital. On October 21st she went to stay with some relatives in another street in Fulham, ami on November 6th a cousin, aged 25, contracted Diphtheria. Shortly after this she went to Kingstonon-Thames, and within a few days her uncle and aunt, with whom she was staying, were attacked with Diphtheria. Several bacteriological examinations were made, and the bacillus of Diphtheria was found on every occasion in the nasal secretion until the end of January, though both the throat and nose appeared perfectly healthy. A resident in Fulham was prosecuted by the Vestry for knowingly placing in a cab his servant, who was suffering from Diphtheria. Fined £3 and 2s. costs. B ENTERIC FEVER 111 cases were notified, or 8.4 per 10,000 inhabitants, the disease being more prevalent than in any year since 1890. The distribution of the under: — Baron's Court Ward 7 Hurlingham 1 Lillie 18 Margravine 34 Munster 19 Sands End 16 Town 7 Walham 9 Fatality. — The disease was the cause of 25 deaths, giving a case mortality of 22.5 per cent., the average for the past 6 years being 20.5 per cent. In several instances the disease was communicated from person to person, owing to the want of cleanliness or the neglect of ordinary precautions, consequent on the nature of the illness not having been at first recognised. In a house in Bayonne Road between the middle of November and the end of December there was a succession of 5 cases, the first case being notified at the end of the third week of the illness, and a lodger, who had removed from the house inDecember to an adjoining street, also contracted the disease. Tn De Morgan Road 3 members of one family had Typhoid, and also another sister in service in West Kensington, who had been in the habit of visiting her home, and there were strong grounds for believing that some cases of " Influenza," which had occurred in the same house about a month before, were really cases of Typhoid. From a house in Field Road a case was removed on November 14th to the Infirmary, and there notified in the same house. Secondary cases were also reported in Aspenlea Road, and Stokenchurch Street. In 3 instances the disease was reported shortly after the basement of the house had been flooded with sewage, owing to the surcharging of the setter. In 5 cases the origin of the disease was ascribed to shell-fish. CHART SHEWING WEEK BY WEEK THE NUMBER OF CASES OF DIPHTHERIA & ENTERIC FEVER. Notified by Medical Practitioners as having occurred in the Parish of Fulham, during the 52 weeks ending December 30th, 1899. CHART SHEWING WEEK BY WEEK THE NUMBER OF CASES OF SCARLET FEVER. Notified by Medical Practitioners as having occurred in the Parish of Fulham, during the 52 weeks ending December 30th, 1899. In 12 cases the disease was contracted outside the district. The rates of incidence and mortality of Typhoid Fever in Fulham, the adjoining parishes and London in 1899 were as under: — Cases notified per 10,000 inhabitants Death rate per 1,000 inhabitants. Fulham 8.4 0.19 Kensington 6.1 0.14 Hammersmith 10.1 0.21 Chelsea 6.0 0.19 London 9.8 0.19 CONTINUED FEVER. One case was notified as Continued Fever, and one death ascribed to it. PUERPERAL FEVER Thirteen cases were notified, of which 5 proved fatal, being in the proportion of 1.1 deaths to 1,000 births. ERYSIPELAS. 178 persons were certified to be suffering from this disease, winch was the assigned cause of 7 deaths. CHOLERA. Four cases of "Cholera" were notified, but there was no reason for thinking that any of these were cases of Asiatic Cholera. DEATHS FROM NON-NOTIFIABLE ZYMOTIC DISEASES. MEASLES. This disease caused 68 deaths during 1899, as compared with 101, 50 and 59 in the three preceding years. The district was almost free from Measles during the first ten months of the year, the usual biennial epidemic commencing in November, and 53 of the deaths occurred in the last two months. The death-rate from the disease in Fulham, the adjoining districts, and London was:— Fulham 0.5 2 Kensington 0.14 Hammersmith 0.20 Chelsea 0.19 London B 2 0.47 The distribution of the deaths was as follows: — Baron's Court Ward 1 Hurlingham 1 Lillie 4 Margravine 12 Munster 12 Sands End 27 Town 2 Walham 9 No steps have yet been taken by the London County Council with respect to the application to Measles of the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, which render a person liable to a penalty, who while suffering from any dangerous infectious disease, wilfully exposes himself without proper precautions against spreading the disease, or being in charge of any person so suffering, exposes such sufferer. WHOOPING COUGH. 54 deaths were ascribed to this disease, being 16 below the average for the last 6 years, allowing for the increase of the population. The death-rate was 0.41, and that of the County of London 0.38. DIARRHŒA. Diarrhœa was given as the cause of 183 deaths, the mortality being slightly less than in 1898, but there was a large increase in the deaths ascribed to Gastro-Enteritis, etc., most of which were of the same nature, so that the actual fatality of epidemic Diarrhoea was higher than in any recent year. Allusion has been made in previous reports to the want of uniformity in the classification of deaths from Diarrhœa, owing to the various names used in death certificates in respect of deaths due to epidemic Diarrh œ a, and the consequent invalidation of comparative .statistics dealing with the Diarrh œ al and Zymotic death-rates. As a result of representations made by the Society of Medical Officers of Health, the Royal College of Physicians have sanctioned the use of the terms " Epidemic Enteritis " or " Zymotic Enteritis" as a synonym for "Epidemic Diarrh œ a," the latter being the title authorised by the" Nomenclature of Diseases," and recommend the entire disuse as synonyms of Epidemic Diarrh œ a of such terms as Gastro-Enteritis, Muco-Enteritis or Gastric Catarrh, and it is to be hoped that medical practitioners will follow these recommendations. In Fulham, Diarrh œ a caused a mortality equal to a rate of 145 per 1,000, which was higher than that of any of the London Sanitary Districts except Poplar 1.45, Shoreditch 1.64, and St. George, Southwark, 1.69. In the 32 large towns the mortality was equal to a rate of 1.21 per 1,000. The rates ranging from 0.47 in Halifax, 0.71 in Swansea, and 0.74 in Birkenhead, to 1.83 in Manchester, 1.87 in Liverpool, 1.97 in Salford, and 2.30 in Preston. The following table gives the Diarrhœal death-rate of Fulham, London, and the adjoining Parishes during the last 14 years:— 1885-1891, 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1.05 1.21 1.45 1.40 Fulham 1.18 1.15 0.94 1.30 0.53 Kensington 0.5 1 0.68 0.64 0.41 0.60 0.33 0.35 0.70 0.59 0.79 Hammersmith 1.12 1.05 0.46 0.80 1.20 0.70 0.79 0.93 0.77 0.82 0.67 1.03 Chelsea 0.77 0.77 0.76 0.34 0.66 London 0.59 0.60 0.80 0.82 0.71 0.92 0.97 0.41 0.92 INFLUENZA, 49 deaths were directly attributed to Influenza, as compared with 66, 13, 19 and 24 in the four preceding years. VENEREAL DISEASES. These were the assigned cause of 17 deaths, 12 being due to Congenital Syphilis, but many of the deaths ascribed to nervous diseases are syphilitic in origin. CLASS III.—DIETETIC DISEASES. Six deaths were certified to be directly due to alcoholic excess, and in 12 cases the disease to which death was attributed was stated to have been accelerated by alcohol, though these represent but a small proportion of the actual number. CLASS IV.—CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES The deaths from in this group numbered 431, being 17.3 per cent, of the deaths from all causes. HEATHS FROM TUBERCULAR DISEASES. Of these 238 were due to Phthisis and 86 to other tubercular diseases, such as Tubercular Meningitis, Tabes Mesenlerica, and General Tuberculosis, these diseases accounting for 13 percent, of the deaths from all causes, and it is probable that many of the deaths ascribed to Marasmus, Debility, Convulsions, etc., were tubercular in nature. In the several Wards of the Parish the deaths from Phthisis were as follows: — Deaths from Phthisis. Deaths per 1,000 living. Barons Court Ward 14 1·1 Hurlingham „ 8 55 1·4 Lillie „ 2·5 Margravine „ 38 38 1·8 Munster „ 1·9 Sands End „ 36 1·2 Town „ 20 1·7 Walham „ 24 1·5 Not Specified „ 5 .. The following Table gives the Phthisis death-rates of Fulham and the adjoining parishes of London for 1899 and the preceding six years : — 1893 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1894 Fulham 1·51 1·42 1·40 1·66 1 ·53 1·47 1·83 Kensington 1·26 1·57 1·53 1·49 1 ·42 1 · 44 1·34 Hammersmith 1· 5 6 1·5 1 1·56 1 ·40 1·48 1·39 1·72 Chelsea 1·75 1·64 1·92 1 · 82 1·80 1·74 1·79 London 1·7 2 1·77 1 · 71 1·72 1·82 1·90 1·68 CANCER. Malignant diseases caused 80 deaths, 66 being of persons over 45 years of age. OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. Of other diseases of this class Rheumatic Fever was the cause of 5 deaths, and Diabetes of 6. 23 CLASS V.—DEVELOPMENTAL DISEASES. From diseases of this class 211 deaths were registered, 147 being due to premature birth, atelectasis or non-inflation of the lungs and congenital deformities, and 64 deaths were ascribed to “old age.” CLASS VI.—LOCAL DISEASES. The diseases of this group were responsible for 1,119 deaths, or 45 per cent. of the total number, the following being the principal classes : — 1.— DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. From these there were 177 deaths, 64 being from Apoplexy, 15 from Insanity and General Paralysis of the Insane, and 37 from Convulsions. 2. — DISEASES OF THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS. 117 deaths were ascribed to diseases of the circulatory system. 3. — DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM. From these diseases, Phthisis being excluded, there were 502 deaths, or 20.1 per cent, of the deaths from all causes, being 41 above the average for the last six years, allowing for the increase of the population. Of these 265 were ascribed to Bronchitis and 211 to Pneumonia. 4. — DISEASES OF THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. Thirteen deaths were registered in this class, seven being due to diseases of parturition. The total number of deaths recorded as occurring within 21 days of childbirth was 13, the causes assigned being: — Septicæmia 5 Scarlet Fever 1 Puerperal Convulsions 1 Hœmorrhage 1 Other Accidents of Childbirth 2 Tuberculosis 1 Diarrhœa 1 Heart Disease 1 13 Or one death to every 352 birth;. From the other classes of Local Diseases there were 310 deaths, viz. : — Diseases of Digestive System 244 „ Urinary „ 47 „ Lymphatic „ 2 „ Integumentary „ 5 „ Bunts and Joints 7 „ Organs of Special Sense 2 „ Gland - like Organs of uncertain use 3 310 CLASS VII. Different forms of violence caused 106 deaths. ACCIDENT OR NEGLIGENCE.

Under this heading there were 111 deaths, the majority, viz., 101, being certified as due to Debility, Marasmus or Inanition. CERTIFICATION OF THE CAUSES OF DEATH. Of the 2,497 deaths registered, 2,295 or 92 per cent, were duly certified by registered medical practitioners, and 200 or 8 per cent. by the Coroner after inquest, only 2 or 0.08 per cent, being uncertified. INQUESTS. Of the 200 held on parishioners, 157 were held in the parish, and 43 outside. The subjects were: males 127, females 73, and their ages — Under 5 76 5 to 65 100 Over 65 24 200 Those due to natural causes may be classified as follows : — Zymotic Diseases 9 Respiratory „ 22 Tubercular „ 7 Circulatory 21 Convulsions and other Diseases of the Nervous System 13 Other diseases 22 94 DEATHS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. FULHAM INFIRMARY AND WORKHOUSE. Although the two parishes, Fulham and Hammersmith, which formerly constituted the Fulham Union, are now separated for poor law purposes, by an arrangement between the Boards of Guardians, the poor of Hammersmith are still received into this Institution. In 1899, 561 deaths occurred in the Infirmary and 17 in the Workhouse. Of these 319 were parishioners of Fulham and 242 belonged to Hammersmith and other parishes. Their ages and the causes of death will be found in Table A. WESTERN FEVER HOSPITAL. 234 deaths occurred in the Western Fever Hospital. Of these 61 belonged to Fulham and 173 to other Metropolitan Districts. DEATHS OCCURRING OUTSIDE THE DISTRICT AMONG PERSONS BELONGING THERETO. The deaths of parishioners in public institutions and elsewhere outside the parish numbered 235, and occurred in the following places : Number of Deaths of Parishioners of Fulham, St. George's Hospital 62 West London „ 31 King's College „ 2 Charing Cross „ 6 Middlesex „ 2 Westminster „ 1 University College „ 2 Guy's „ 1 German „ 3 Jubilee „ 8 Brompton Hospital for Consumption 10 Cancer Hospital 4 Chelsea Hospital for Women 1 Queen Charlotte's Hospital 2 Victoria Hospital for Children 8 Belgrave „ „ 1 Hospital for Children, Great Ormond Street 3 Banstead Asylum 3 Cane Hill „ 6 Caterham „ 2 Colney Hatch „ 7 Dartford „ 3 Hanwell „ 10 Ilford „ 2 Leavesden „ 1 Fountain Fever Hospital 11 Grove „ „ 7 North-Western Fever Hospital 4 South-Western „ „ 6 Friedenheim 1 St. Luke's Home, Osnaburgh Street 1 Chelsea Infirmary 1 St. George's Infirmary 2 St. Olave's Infirmary 1 In private houses and elsewhere in other parishes 20 235 Of the 2,497 deaths registered during the year, 598 or 23 . 7 per cent, took place in public institutions. The percentages in the several classes of institutions in Fulham and London were as follows : — Deaths occurring in Workhouses and Workhouse Infirmaries Fulham. 12.9 London. 15.8 Deaths occurring in Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals 3.6 2.1 Deaths occurring in other Hospitals 6.0 9.9 Deaths occurring in Public Lunatic and Imbecile Asylums 1.4 2.1 23·9 29·9 PUBLIC MORTUARY, 182 bodies were removed to the Mortuary during the year and were admitted as follows: — At the request of the Coroner 151 Brought in by the Police 27 At the request of the Medical Officer of Health 4 182 Inquests were held on 178, and post-mortem examinations were made in 93 of the above cases. DISINFECTION. Infected articles were disinfected by the contractor, Mr. Lacy, St. John's Wharf, Townmead Road, by whom they were also collected. The weight of the articles disinfected was 2,260 cwt, and the amount paid by the Vestry to Mr. Lacy ,£1,412 16s. Iod. During the last three years the cost of disinfection has averaged £1,143 a year. A very complete disinfecting station is now being erected in Townmead Road, and will probably be ready for use in October next. VACCINATION. The following Tables, furnished by Mr. Busby, the Vaccination Officer, give the vaccination returns for 1898, and for the first six months of 1899, those for the last six months not being yet complete : — SUPPLEMENTAL RETURN FOR 1898, FOR THE PARISH OF FULHAM. No. of Births from 1st Jan., 1899, to 3 0th June, 1899. Successfully Vaccinated. Outstanding. Certificates Granted under Clause 2 of the Vaccination Act of 1898. Insuscept ible of Vaccination. Had Small Pox. Dead. Postponed by Medical Certificate. Removed. 4311 3170 23 - 453 78 461 36 90 RETURN OF VACCINATION FOR THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY TO JUNE, 1899, FOR THE PARISH OF FULHAM. No of Births Registered from 1st J n., 1898. to 31st Dec.. 1898 Successfully Vaccinated. Insusceptible of Vaccination. Had Small Pox. Dead. Postponed by Medical Certificate. Removed. Outstanding. Certificates Granted under Clause 2 of the Vaccination Act of 1898. 2332 1548 - 292 84 216 135 20 37 The return for 1898 is the most unsatisfactory one that has been issued, 13.6 per cent, of the children born in Fulham, or 15.2 per cent, including cases postponed, appearing in the vaccination returns as “ not finally accounted for,” the highest proportion hitherto having been 10 per cent, in 1894. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS More extended use has been made by medical practitioners of the facilities afforded by the Vestry for the employment of bacteriological examinations for the purposes of diagnosis, and the following examinations were made during the year: — Diphtheria. —Material from 139 cases was examined, and the bacillus of Diphtheria was found in 76. Enteric fever. Blood from 17 cases was examined, and the Widal (Typhoid) reaction was obtained in 14. Tuberculosis.- Sputum from eight cases was examined, and the tubercle bacillus was found in four. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. 329 houses have now been placed cm the register with beneficial results. The definition however of the term “landlord” in the bye-laws has given rise to difficulties, as a weekly tenant who sublets some of the rooms is the “landlord” within the meaning of these and not the “owner” who consequently has in some cases repudiated any responsibility for the observance of the bye-laws. It is advisable, moreover, that the rent limit, viz., 6s. for unfurnished rooms, should be raised. CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACTS, 1890 AND 1891. Certificates under these Acts were granted in respect of 212 separate tenements and refused in respect of 593. COMBINED DRAINAGE. Tenders for the reconstruction of 47 systems of combined drainage at a cost of £1,066 were accepted by the Vestry during the year and the sum of £175 was paid to owners of houses in respect of drainage work executed by them in compliance with the notices of the Vestry on combined drains, which were sewers within the meaning of the Metropolis Local Management Act. The prospect of an amendment of the present inequitable law relating to combined drainage is still very remote. SMOKE NUISANCES. Proceedings were instituted by the Vestry in 15 instances in respect of smoke nuisances, in 13 of which fines to the amount of £52 4s. were imposed, and in two the summonses were dismissed on technical grounds. FOOD INSPECTION Four prosecutions were instituted by the Vestry in respect of unsound food which was seized by the Sanitary Inspectors and condemned by the Magistrate and penalties amounting in all to £33 14s. were imposed. In one case, in which a firm was prosecuted for having sold unsound food, the summons was dismissed on the ground that it was possible that the meat which had been sold on Saturday evening, and was brought to the Town Hall on Monday morning in an advanced state of decomposition, might have been sound when sold. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS The following samples were taken for analysis during the year:— Article. No. of samples. No. adulterated. Percentage of adulteration.

SANITARY LEGISLATION, 1899. The following is a short abstract of the sanitary provisions of the Acts affecting the Metropolis that were passed in 1899: — The, Metropolis Water Act, 1899, which enables and requires the Metropolitan Water Companies to supply each other with water in cases of emergency, and to construct the necessary works if so required by the Local Government Board. The London Government Act, 1899, an Act to make better provision for Local Government in London, by making Metropolitan Boroughs, the Councils of which shall each consist of a Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors. By this Act, the following powers and duties will be transferred from the London County Council to the Borough Councils: — The registration of dairymen and the duty of enforcing the byelaws and regulations with respect to dairies and milk, and with respect to slaughter-houses, knackers' yards, and offensive businesses [2nd Sched., Part 1., and sec. 6 (4)]. The power to adopt Part 111. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, that is, the power of providing “lodging-houses for the working classes” [2nd Sched., Part. II.] The Metropolis Management Acts Amendment (Bye-Laws) Act, 1899, authorises the London County Council to make bye-laws requiring persons about to do drainage work to deposit with the Sanitary Authority all necessary plans, sections and particulars. The Seats for Shop Assistants Act, 1899, provides for seats being supplied in tne proportion of at least one for every three female assistants in each room of retail shops. It is to be enforced by the London County Council. The Board of Education Act, 1899, provides for the inspection of Secondary Schools by Officers of that Board to ascertain the provisions made for the health of the scholars. The Small Dwelling Acquisition Act, 1899, empowers Local Authorities to advance money for enabling persons to acquire the ownership of small houses in which they reside. The Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, considerably amends the previous Acts relating thereto. Importers are liable to heavy penalties unless margarine or margarine-cheese, adulterated or impoverished butter, milk or cream, or condensed, separated, or skimmed milk, is imported in packages, tins, or other receptacles conspicuously marked, and indicating the nature of the contents. Power is given to the Local Government Board or the Board of Agriculture to sample articles of food. Power is given to the Board of Agriculture to make regulations for determining the standards to be taken in the analysis of milk, cream, butter, or cheese. All packages of “ Margarine ” or “ Margarine Cheese ” must be marked as such in 3/4-inch letters on the top, bottom, and sides of such package, not on a label attached thereto. When exposed for sale, it must be marked in 1 1/2-inch block letters, and when sold must be delivered in a wrapper marked in 1 1/2-inch block letters “Margarine” or “Margarine Cheese,” as the case may be, and no other printed matter must appear on the wrapper. All manufacturers of and wholesale dealers in Margarine must register the premises at which they carry on their business with the Local Authority, and keep a register of all Margarine and Margarine Cheese imported and sold by them. No one shall make, sell, or expose for sale any Margarine the fat of which contains more than 10 per cent. of butter-fat. Every person who, by himself or his servant, in any highway or place of public resort, sells milk or cream from any vehicle, can, or other receptacle, must have his name and address conspicuously inscribed on the vehicle or receptacle. Every tin or other receptacle containing condensed, separated or skimmed milk must bear a label clearly visible to the purchaser, on which the words “Machine Skimmed Milk” or “Skimmed Milk,” as the case may require, must be printed in large and legible type. No label giving notice of admixture of any article shall be deemed to be distinctly or legibly written or printed if the notice of mixture is obscured by any other matter on the label. All samples when purchased must be divided into three parts. If the vendor wishes to have one of these parts, he must ask the purchaser for it. At the request or with the consent of the purchaser, samples of all articles may be taken in course of delivery. The expression “Food” includes any article used for food or drink by man, except drugs and water, and any article which ordinarily enters into or is used in the composition or preparation of food, and flavouring matters and condiments. The Local Government Board issued a circular and orders, together with model regulations for dairies, cowsheds, and milk-shops, in accordance with the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis. By an Order of the Home Secretary of March 17th, all cases of poisoning by mercury contracted in any factory or workshop have to be notified to the Home Office. GENERAL SANITARY WORK. 967 complaints were received and attended to during the year and 2,520 “intimation notices” and 848 “statutory notices” were served. It is unnecessary to notice in detail the various improvements effected, but speedy progress has been made in the improvement of the general sanitary condition of the parish; and on behalf of the Sanitary Staff I have to express their satisfaction that the Vestry showed their appreciation of their work by adopting a more liberal scale of remuneration.
