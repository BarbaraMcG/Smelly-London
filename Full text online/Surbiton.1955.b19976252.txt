ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1955 Public Health Department, 2, Shalston Villas, SURBITON. July, 1956. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Surbiton. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting my thirty-fourth Annual Report, but it is with some regret that I have to do this owing to the fact that my retirement took place on 19th December, 1955, but I was permitted to continue until the end of the year so that I could render the report for the year ending 31st December, 1955. During my term of office as Medical Officer of Health to Surbiton I have seen many changes. In 1922 the population was approximately 19,000 and the town of Surbiton seemed to be round and in the vicinity of the station; the then station was not very attractive. However, it was redesigned in modern style in 1937. The greater part of Surbiton was open fields which afforded delightful walks. The Kingston By-Pass Road was not in existence. After 1926 the town began to become larger with the rapid increase of house building. The Council Offices were extended, and a new library and swimming pool were built giving added attractions to the residents. In those days the Fire Brigade was manned by volunteers and was housed in Victoria Road. The development of Surbiton brought the population of this small town up to well over 60,000 and it has overshadowed the important town of Kingston as far as size and resident population is concerned. The Isolation Hospital was enlarged and now accommodates tubercular cases as well as the usual infectious diseases. After Surbiton. Hospital was erected in Ewell Road with the aid of voluntary subscriptions the old Cottage Hospital in St. James' Road was brought into use for old chronic cases. The health of Surbiton has improved since 1922. The advent of immunisation has cleared diphtheria from Surbiton. The infantile mortality rate declined to 11.02 in 1954 which was the lowest figure on record but there was an unaccountable increase to 22.36 in 1955. Dealing with the year 1955 the number of births attributed to Surbiton was 760 ns against 816 for 1954* The decline of births since 1946 is no doubt due to the economical situation, difficulty in finding accommodation, etc. The number of deaths for 1955 was 600 against 596 for 1954. This leaves a natural increase of 160. It is therefore difficult to understand why the population for 1955 is given as 62,570 when the population for 1954 was 63,320; however these figures are supplied by the Registrar General. 2. STATISTICS Area (in acres) 4,709 population (June 1955) Registrar General's Estimate 62,570 Resident Population (Census 1951) 60,675 Estimated number of separate habitable dwellings (houses and flats) in the Borough at the end of the year 18,203 Number of new houses erected during the year:- (a) By local authority 20 (b) By other local authorities (flats) 45 (c) By private enterprise 99 (d) Rebuilt following destruction by enemy action Nil (e) Self-contained flats/provided by conversion (private enterprise) 23 Rateable value at 31st December, 1955 £714,121 Sum represented by a penny rate £2,925 3.

PREVALENCE OF AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS DISEASE The Kingston Group Hospital Management Committee (South West Metropolitan Region) has supplied me with the following figures for 1955:- ANALYSIS OF PATIENTS ADMITTED TO THE TOLWORTH HOSPITAL FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31st DECEMBER, 1955. Diphtheria Scarlet Fever Other Diseases Total Surbiton - 13 90 103 Malden - 1 61 62 Esher - - 44 44 Totals - 14 195 209 The 90 "other diseases" admitted to the hospital from Surbiton were as follows:- Pulmonary Tuberculosis 25 T.B. and Rt. p1.

Glandular Fever 1 Enteritis 1 Rubella 1 Colitis 3 Impetigo 1 Erysipelas 2 puerperal Pyrexia 1 Impetigo, Cellulitis of face 1 Infective Hepatitis 2 From this table it will be noticed that Surbiton have practically half of the number of cases admitted. The reason may possibly be due to the fact that the hospital is situated in the area and other districts may find it more convenient to use nearer isolation hospitals. The number of poliomyelitis cases admitted is fifteen but seven of the cases were sent in on suspicion and not confirmed. There were, however, eight confirmed cases in 1955. Only two were of the paralytic type and fortunately no deaths occurred. 8.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply. The water throughout the district is furnished by the Metropolitan Water Board, and is a constant supply of excellent quality. Monthly reports by the Board are supplied giving details of their chemical and bacteriological examinations. Public Cleansing Refuse and Salvage Collection The rate of the collection of refuse and salvage, except when Bank Holidays interfered with the collection, was maintained at once in every seven days. Rivers and Streams. Hogsmill River The widening of the course of this stream through the Borough is nearly completed, but the state of the water is likely to remain unsatisfactory until the effluent from the Epsom Sewage Disposal Works is no longer discharged into it. A new sewer is under construction which will soon carry sewage from Epsom to the joint disposal works being provided in Lower Marsh Lane. Meanwhile notice boards are still displayed warning against bathing and paddling in the Hogsmill River. Swimming Baths and Pools Publicly owned baths Surbiton Lagoon, situated in Raeburn Avenue, Surbiton, is an open air pool 165 feet long and 90 feet wide, with a depth of three to nine feet. The water is treated by continuous pressure sand filtration, sterilisation by breakpoint chlorination and oxygenation over an ornamental cascade. Periodical samples of water are taken by the Borough Engineer and the plant adjusted as necessary. In addition eleven samples were taken by the Public Health Department for both chemical and bacteriological examination all of which proved to be satisfactory. Privately owned bath open to the public. Ace of Spades Swimming Pool, Kingston-By-Pass Road,is an open air pool 40 feet by 20 feet with a depth of 4 feet to 7 feet 6 inches. The water is treated by continuous pressure sand filtration, sterilisation by injection of chlorine and oxygenation over an ornamental cascade. Five samples were taken by the Department and were satisfactory. School Bath One private school has a small swimming bath which is used only by scholars and staff. Sterilisation is by hand dosing with chlorine coupled with frequent changes of the water. Six samples were taken by the Department to ensure adequate chlorination. 15. Food Poisoning There were no outbreaks of food poisoning and no deaths from this cause. Four cases were notified; in one case the causative organism was identified as C1. Welchii, whilst no cause for the others could be found. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948. It was not necessary to take action under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948.

HOUSING REPAIRS & RENTS ACT.1954. This Act required Councils to submit to the Minister of Housing and Local Government "by 30th August, 1955, proposals for dealing with unfit houses in their districts. The situation was not very serious here because the policy of the Council for many years has been to insist upon owners maintaining their property in good condition or pulling it down when it became beyond repair at reasonable cost. After due consideration it was decided to inform the Minister that out of 18,466 permanent dwellings in the area only six houses were considered to be unfit and suitable for action under Sections 11 or 25 of the Housing Act, 1936. During the year twenty-five applications for Certificates of Disrepair were received following action by landlords to apply the permitted rent increase. Twenty such Certificates were granted, four refused, and one application withdrawn, making a total since the commencement of the Act (1st August 1954) of 45 issued, four refused, and thirty-six revoked upon completion of the necessary repairs. The expected flood of applications for these Certificates did not arrive and generally the whole thing passed off with considerably less trouble than had been anticipated. It is, of course, not known to what extent landlords tried to take advantage of the opportunity to raise rents. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS. The Housing Act, 1949 introduced a scheme to encourage property owners to modernise existing houses "which though soundly constructed and in good general repair, lack the amenities and conveniences which have come to be regarded as essential to a decent and healthy life", by providing financial assistance for works of improvement. The Council continued to operate this scheme in cases where new housing accommodation would be provided by the conversion of an existing building, where additional accommodation was to be provided by adding rooms, and where it was intended to improve the sanitary arrangements and/or the system of water heating. 24. Nineteen applications for grants were received during the year. Twelve were recommended by the Council and the remainder were disposed of as follows:— Rejected No further action Pending. 4 1 2 IMPROVEMENT GRANTS(cont.)

One hundred and thirty-five dustbins were provided as a result of notices served, six such being statutory and the remainder informal. The Council's scheme for the sale of new dustbins was continued, ninety bins being sold during the year. FOOD INSPECTION. Foodstuffs of all descriptions are constantly under inspection to see that they are fit for human consumption. During the year a large variety of foods which were not so fit were surrendered by the owners and either salvaged for animal feeding or destroyed by burning. The total weight of such goods was 2 tons: 11 cwts: 1 qr: 15 lbs; 9¾ ozs. There is now no slaughterhouse in use in the Borough consequently no meat inspection is carried out except in butchers' shops. Seventy-four samples of various kinds were taken for bacteriological examination as a routine measure to check on fitness for food. FOOD HYGIENE. Forty-one premises are registered under section 14 of the Food & Drugs Act, 1938, for the preparation or manufacture of sausages, or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food intended for sale. Nine hundred and thirty-eight visits were made to these premises and to shops, canteens, restaurants, public-houses, food-handling businesses, and vehicles to ensure the maintenance of a proper standard of hygiene and to examine food intended for sale. The following works were carried out to meet the requirements of the Food & Drugs Act, byelaws and other legislation Hot water supply provided 7 Protection of food from contamination 1 Windows repaired og? renewed 1 Floors repaired or renewed 5 Food premises cleansed 33 Drains cleansed, repaired or renewed 4 W.Cs. cleansed or repaired 6 W.Cs. lighted or ventilated 1 Cold stores repaired 1 Cold stores provided 1 Accumulations removed 4 Dustbins supplied 11 Food vans repaired 1 Miscellaneous 11 In general the standard of food hygiene throughout the Borough has been maintained at a satisfactory level, though it is a subject which requires constant attention by the Inspectors New legislation with an all round tightening-up was expected during the year, but in fact did not arrive until 1st January 1956 and will therefore be the subject of comment in next year's report. 26.

The Analyst's reports and details of action taken on contravening samples were as follows:— 1594 (informal) 1605 (") 1606 (") 1608 (") 1609 (") Soup - tomato, tinned for infant feeding. These tomato soups all contained tin and iron in proportions varying from 30 - 54 p.p.m. respectively and in each sample there was a metallic flavour. The internal lacquering had failed to protect the contents from this metallic contamination. Having regard to the purpose for which these articles were sold he was of the opinion it was important to ensure the absence as far as possible of contaminating metals. These reports were taken up with the manufacturers concerned who, whilst not agreeing that the contamination was excessive, appeared to he taking precautions to minimise such contamination and to see that their products reached the public in the best possible condition. 1580 (informal) 1598 (") 1599 (") 1601 (") Soup - liver, tinned for infant feeding. These soups contained tin varying from 32 ppm. to 100 p.p.m. and iron from 43 p.p.m. to 90 p.p.m. and in each sample there was a distinct metallic taste. The cans were lacquered internally hut the lacquer had partially failed resulting in this metallic contamination. Having regard to the purpose for which these articles were sold, he was of the opinion it was important to ensure the absence as far as possible of contaminating metals. These reports were taken up with the manufacturers who did not agree that the metallic contamination was excessive. They thought however that some of their products might be "out of condition" and these stocks with retailers would be replaced. 1591 (informal) Apples with Rose Hip Syrup. Contained not more than 2% of rose hip syrup (if any) and no vitamin C. Having regard to the wide use of rose hip syrup as a source of vitamin C the description on the label was in his opinion grossly misleading as to the nature and to the nutritional or dietary value of this article. Manufacturers agreed to omit rose hip syrup from their next apple production and to use a different description. 29. 1588 (informal) Soup - Cream of mushroom dried. The proportion of fat in the soup prepared according to the directions of the label would amount to only 0.6% whereas cream soups of ordinary commercial quality contain not less than of fat. The dried soup as received contained only 8.0% of fat. Formal sample taken (see No. 1615). 1607 (informal) Soup - tomato, tinned for infant feeding. Consisted of a type of flavoured cornflour. This was supplied by the manufacturer for checking during an investigation into the problem of metallic contamination and was obviously an error. 1646 (informal) Vitaminised iron and yeast tablets. Deficient in vitamin C to the extent of 71% of the amount claimed on the label. Instructions given for formal sample to be taken (See No. 1649). 1614 (formal) Sausage- pork It was a sample of preserved pork sausage containing 180 p.p.m. of sulphur dioxide. Warning given as a result of which proper notice has since been displayed in shop. 1622 (formal) Sausage - pork. Contained only 53% of meat. Proceedings instituted. A fine of £10. was imposed and the Council awarded 10 guineas costs. 1615 (formal) Soup - Cream of mushroom, dried. The proportion of fat in the soup prepared according to the directions would amount to only 0.5% whereas cream soups of ordinary commercial quality intended for direct use without dilution contain not less than 3½% of fat. The dried soup as received contained 6.6% of fat. The retailer stated that he would rely on a warranty. Enquiries about the manufacturers revealed that they had left their registered office and they stated they were in liquidation but this was not confirmed by the Registrar of Companies. Meanwhile proceedings were brought by another local authority who secured a conviction against the manufacturers in respect of this article. The Council therefore decided to deal with this sample by way of warning letters to retailer and manufacturer with the suggestion that arrangements might be made to withdraw this soup from sale. 30. 1649 (formal) Vitaminised iron and yeast tablets. 73% deficient in ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Warning given to manufacturers who withdrew the stock in the hands of the retailer and replaced it. The agreed with the findings of the Public Analyst and were carrying out investigational work to ascert??? why loss of vitamin C. had taken place. In the meantime they expressed their intention of not manufacturing these tablets until their investigations had reached a satisfactory conclusion. 1668 (informal) Potted Meat. Contained 65% meat, including fat, 7% dry cereal matter, 2% seasoning and 26% of additional water, whereas in his opinion an article described as potted meat should consist entirely of meat with additional seasoning only. Enquiries revealed that consignment of this food were imported several years ago and this was probably a relic. The small remaining stock was withdrawn from sale by the retailer. 1682 (informal) Chicklettes. This article contained not more the 25% of chicken meat whereas in his opinion an article described as "Real chicken in a delicious form" should consist substantially of chicken meat with additional seasoning. Warning letter sent to manufacture who had already brought into use a more suitably worded show card. 1688 (informal) Cod Liver Oil. This oil was of relatively low Vitamin A content and in his opinion did not justify the claim on the label that "this oil is guaranteed to be particularly rich in both vitamins (A & D) and is far superior to cheap inferior oils of low vitamin content". The pharmacist explained that the labels were provided by himself when his supplies were obtained from a different source and he was satisfied that the claim was then justified. He had thoughtlessly continued using these labels without checking his new supplies. The remaining stocks of labels had been destroyed. Warning letter sent. 31. There were in addition three prosecutions as follows:— (i) For selling to the prejudice of the purchaser a loaf of bread which was not of the substance demanded in that it contained tobacco. A fine of £5 was imposed and the Council awarded £3.3.0. costs and £4.18.0 expenses. (ii) For selling to the prejudice of the purchaser a loaf of bread which was not of the substance demanded in that it contained a piece of wire wool. A fine of £20. was imposed and the Council awarded £5.5.0. costs. (iii)For selling to the prejudice of the purchaser a loaf of bread which was not of the substance demanded in that it contained a piece of galvanised wire. A fine of £3. was imposed and the Council awarded £2.2.0d. costs. MILK SUPPLY. (i). at the end of the year there were thirty-eight entries on the register as follows:— Distributors of milk with premises in the Borough 21 Distributors of milk with premises outside the Borough but retailing in the Borough 9 Premises registered (used as Dairies) 8 (ii) Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations 1949-1954. Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949-1953. Dealers' licences to sell designated milk were granted as follows:— Pasteurised milk 19 " " (supplementary) 8 Tuberculin Tested 18 " " (supplementary) 7 Sterilised Milk 17 " " (supplementary) 8 (iii)One hundred and thirty samples of milk were taken during the year and submitted to the following tests:— Turbidity Test T.B. Biological Test Methylene Phosphatase Blue Test Test Pasteurised — — 74 74 TT Pasteurised — — 12 12 Sterilised 14 — — — TT Farm Bottled — 7 4 — Tuberculin Tested — 12 1 — Raw ungraded — 6 — — The phosphatase test indicates that pasteurisation has been 32. properly carried out; the methylene blue test is used to determine cleanliness and keeping quality; the turbidity test is a check on sterilisation and the T.B. test is for the purpose of detecting tubercle bacilli. All four T.T. Farm-bottled samples (three from one farm) failed the methylene "blue test. Very little of this milk is now sold and then only when specially ordered, so it is not easy to take samples. One Pasteurised sample also failed methylene blue, but otherwise all samples passed the prescribed tests. Proceedings were twice taken against a Distributor under Section 26 (l) of the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, for failing to ensure that a vessel (bottle) used for containing milk was in a state of thorough cleanliness. In the first case a fine of £10 was imposed and the Council awarded £3.3.0 costs, whilst in the second case the fine was £25. and the costs £5.5.0. ICE CREAM. Premises have been registered by the Corporation under Section 14, Pood & Drugs Act, 1938, as under For manufacture, storage and sale 8 For manufacture, storage and sale but manufacture to be limited to iced lollies 13 For storage and sale, but not manufacture 120 During the year 17 applications for registration were received (including 10 changes of occupier). 87 samples were taken, details being as follows Ice Cream Grade 1 62 86.1% Grade 2 6 94. 44% Grade 3 4 5.56% 72 Iced Lollies Grade 1 15 87 The Public Health Laboratory Service advises that it is unwise to pay too much attention to the result of any one sample. Judgment should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested that it would be reasonable to expect about 50 per cent of samples throughout the year to fall into Grade 1, 80 per cent into Grades 1 or 2, not more than 20 per cent into Grade 3, and none into Grade The results shewn above indicate that the satisfactory standard referred to in my last report is being maintained. 33. ICE CREAM (Cont.) Each retailer from whom a sample was taken was supplied with a copy of the laboratory report; where manufacture took place outside the Borough copies of reports whether good or otherwise were also sent to the Sanitary Inspector for the District concerned for his information. No ice cream is now manufactured within the Borough, tut a few retailers make their own iced lollies. DYSENTERY, PARA-TYPHOID FEVER AND POOD POISONING. The number of specimens collected and taken to the Laboratory for bacteriological examination in the course of investigating these illnesses was as follows:— Faeces Suspected food 1950 1202 13 1951 694 2 1952 183 15 1953 129 12 1954 263 8 1955 306 10 FACTORIES AND BAKEHOUSES. The total number of factories on the register at the end of the year was 266 (224 mechanical, 35 non-mechanical, and 7 works of building construction). Three hundred and fifty-four visits were made to these premises, and work was carried out to remedy contraventions found as under:— Insufficient sanitary conveniences 3 factories Defective,dirty or inadequately lighted sanitary conveniences 23 " Other offences, etc. 10 " Pour certificates were issued under section 34 of the Factories Act, 1937, that the factories to which they related were provided with such means of escape in case of fire for the persons employed therein as may be reasonably required in the circumstances, There were one hundred and eighteen outworkers on the register at the end of the year. Eight visits were made. 34. MOVEABLE DWELLINGS. Forty-seven licences to station and use moveable dwellings (caravans) were granted during the year. Twenty-four of the caravans are standing on the Riverhill Estate which has been leased to a local Sports Club. The remainder are stationed on odd sites throughout the Borough. There is one site on which some unlicenced caravans are parked which is being dealt with by the acquisition of the premises by the Council. Proceedings were instituted to enforce compliance with the Order of the Justices dated 6th May, 1947, made under section 57 of the Surrey County Council Act,1931, as amended, prohibiting the stationing of caravans in Green Lane, Chessington. Seven summonses were issued. Pour caravans were involved, three being occupied and one unoccupied. The occupiers of the first three caravans were each charged with retaining the caravans in contravention of the Justices Order, and the occupier of the land was charged with retaining the unoccupied caravan. The occupier of the land was also charged with aiding and abetting the three caravan occupiers in committing the alleged offences. The Court convicted on all seven summonses, but in view of mitigating circumstances low penalties were imposed. The occupier of the land was fined £1 for retaining the unoccupied caravan and was conditionally discharged on each of the summonses charging him with aiding and abetting. The occupiers of the other caravans were each conditionally discharged. Three of the caravans were eventually removed from the land, whilst the fourth, having regard to special circumstances was allowed to remain and duly licensed. 35. SHOPS ACT, 1950. One hundred and ninety-eight visits were made in the administration of this Act, and nineteen infringements corrected.

This Act which prohibits the sale or letting of certain heating appliances without an effective fireguard, together with Regulations made by the Secretary of State, became fully operative during 1954. Thirty-one visits were made to premises in the Borough and where such appliances were not satisfactory seven warnings of infringements were given. The offending appliances were either modified or withdrawn from sale. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. This Act is designed "to regulate the sale of pet animals". Licences in respect of four such premises were issued during the year. Nineteen inspections were made but no infringements of the licence conditions were found. 36. DISINFECTION. (a) During the year disinfection was carried out at forty-three premises in which the following diseases occurred Poliomyelitis (or suspected) 18 Suspected Para-typhoid B. 1 Scarlet fever 5 Tuberculosis 10 Meningococcal infection 2 Miscellaneous 7 Disinfection was also carried out at twenty-four premises on request, the occupier in each case paying the cost. (b) The total number of articles disinfected by steam at the Tolworth Hospital, or destroyed was:— Disinfected Destroyed. Blankets 28 1 Bolsters 3 1 Featherbeds 3 5 Mattresses 10 4 Mattress covers 3 3 Pillows 34 8 Pillow cases 9 8 Sheets 5 — Towels 3 — Wearing apparel 12 — Bedspreads 3 — Rugs 4 — Miscellaneous — 1 117 33 (c) No. of rooms disinfected 94 No. of library books disinfected 89 37.

At the request of the County Council nine school canteens were sprayed with insecticide to prevent flies and other insect pests, the County Council paying the cost of the work. (c) General. Advice is frequently sought from the Department in the identification and measures for eradication of insect pests of various kinds. For the convenience of the public a stock of insecticides and sprayers is held in the Department, and these articles are sold at cost price when required. This service seems to he much appreciated, NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948. One burial was effected in accordance with Section 50 of the Act where it appeared that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body were being made otherwise than by the Council. PUBLIC MORTUARY. During the year 74 bodies were received into the mortuary for post-mortem examination. 38. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries continued its grant-aid of 50 per cent of the irrecoverable expenditure incurred by the Council in carrying out its functions under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. Grant-aid is not available in respect of expenditure incurred on treatment at commercial and industrial premises, and the full cost of the work has therefore to be recovered from the occupiers or, in certain circumstances, the owners. 46 business or industrial premises, schools, etc. were treated by the Council's staff on payment of the cost involved by the occupiers or owners concerned. Whilst it is the duty of occupiers of houses to keep their premises free from rats and mice, the Council continued to carry out treatment of infestations at private dwellings without charge provided the occupiers took such steps as might from time to time be necessary and reasonably practicable for preventing their premises from becoming infested. This decision has considerably facilitated the work at private houses as treatment is able to proceed almost immediately an infestation is found. The figures which follow indicate the extent of the work carried out during the year. It seems that the rodent population is being kept down to as low a level as is likely to be achieved until new techniques are evolved and perhaps new poisons introduced. 39. VISITS.

CONCLUSION. This was another busy year of steady progress with no spectacular occurrences. Despite the unfortunate absence on sick leave for a long period of one of the Inspectors (now, I am glad to say fully restored to health) every effort was made to give adequate attention to the manifold duties with which we are entrusted. This is the last report I shall write of services rendered to the Council under the general direction of Dr. Linzee who retired on 31st December, 1955. I worked with him for twenty-two years (eight as Senior Inspector) so his departure "breaks a long association, and I should like to record my thanks to him for his friendliness and help to me, and to wish him every happiness in his retirement. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H.J. ELDRIDGE, Senior Sanitary Inspector. In presenting this my last report to the Council I wish to thank all the members of the Public Health staff for their assistance to me. Since my appointment in 1922 I have worked with three Senior Sanitary Inspectors, Mr. Nesfield until his retirement in 1931, Mr, McClelland until his untimely death in 1947 and finally Mr. Eldridge. I cannot let this opportunity go without drawing the attention of the Council to the great help given to me at all times by Mr. Eldridge, Mr. Elms, and Miss Cryer. I am, Yours faithfully, N.H. LINZEE. Medical Officer of Health. 43.
