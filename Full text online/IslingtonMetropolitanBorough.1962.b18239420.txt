AC 4361 Library-rec'd LA(Gen)21-10-63 ISL91 1962 ANNUAL REPORT on the HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITIONS of the METROPOLITAN BOROUG OF ISLINGTON. VICTOR FREEMAN, m.r.c.s., l.r.c.p., d.p.h., Medical Officer of Health. CAN 3388 Public Health Department Town Hall, Islington, N.l TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ISLINGTON The 1962 Annual Report, which I have the honour to present, on the health and sanitary conditions in the Borough, records a further instalment of the changes which have taken place over the past few years in community health risks which were once regarded as traditional It also gives some indications of the major health and medico-social problems for which answers will no doubt be sought in the 1960s and perhaps 1970s. Basic information about population structure is essential for public health planning. Further details from the 1961 Census are now available and are referred to in the Vital Statistics Section of this Report. The outstanding feature about the population distribution throughout the Borough is the high average density in every single ward. Some wards, of course, are more densely populated than others, but even in Highbury, the ward with the lowest density figure, the rate approaches a proportion which is not far short of double the number of persons per acre for the whole County of London, and in the most densely peopled wards, naaely, Barnsbury and St Peter, the densities are more than double the London average. It will be appreciated that this scarcity of spare space must in itself, give rise to many public health problems,, including of course, housing. Another feature of the 1961 Census which is of significance in Islington, is the proportion of immigrants from various parts of the Commonwealth who have taken up residence in the Borough. The Report returned over 9,000 from Cyprus just under 8,000 from the Caribbean territories, and approximately 1,500 from India and Pakistan. The 1961 Census also provided some useful details in regard to the housing of the people. In Islington the percentage of persons occupying accommodation at a proportion of more than 1& per room is 17.7% as compared with 11Â½% for the whole County of London. The Census also throws some statistical light on the distance to be covered before it can be said that the majority, if not all of Islington residents are living in homes which are fitted to modern conceptions of sanitary and hygiene requirements Of the total of 80,000 Islington households 57.4% were returned as being without any kind of piped hot water supply 45% of households without a fixed bath, whilst another 25% have to share a bath, and 54% of all households have to share a water closet. There is some improvement in these figures over the 1951 Census Return but it is not a major improvement. Birth rate records continue to be combined with lower still infant mortality figures. The 1947 bulge figures have again been exceeded, with a total of 5,797 live births and the infant mortality is a fraction over 19 deaths per thousand live births, the lowest ever recorded, apart from a most exceptional return in 1954 When such figures are taken in conjunction with the social and housing circumstances revealed by the Census, something of the burden which must be placed upon the hospital and domiciliary maternity services and the child welfare services of the local health authority in conjunction with the family practitioners, must be apparent There is still no rea&on to believe that the risks of infant death in the first twelve months cannot be reduced to an even greater extent, and improvements in housing and environmental conditions generally are bound to make a positive contribution to this end in the years to come. i Infectious Disease The health risks from infectious diseases are rapidly being reduced. Diphtheria is, of course, now rare, and there was not a single case in the Borough last year. With active immunisation against Poliomyelitis now well under way, this infection seems to be going in the same direction and there were only two cases during the year, whilst notifications of Whooping Cough are probably not entirely complete, the fact that there were only 51, which is a new low record, also speaks for itself, since this is another infection which is subject to immunisation control. Measles cannot yet be dealt with by immunisation, but after the peak incidence of 1961, there were many fewer cases in 1962. Sonne Dysentery and Pood Poisoning continue to be endemic, but are associated with faulty hygiene at some stage. Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fevers are still to be reckoned with, although modern treatment has diminished the risk if infection should occur, The Enteric infections are still fairly prevalent in Mediterranean countries, and easy and frequent travel to those regions makes occasional cases in this country almost unaviodable, apart from risks from other sources. Reference is made in the Report to precautions taken in respect of possible or suspected Smallpox contacts, although fortunately, there were no cases in the borough Smallpox control measures at airports have now been strengthened by the requirement of vaccination certificates. Tuberculosis of the lungs which is slowly diminishing each year, is still nevertheless the major infectious disease with nearly 300 new cases. Respiratory Disease Other major health problems which are or should be, subject to some control even within our present knowledge, will have to be faced over the next few years. 1962 was perhaps notable for the publication of the Report of the Royal College of Physicians on smoking and health, which gave wider publicity to this subject than at any time previously, with discussions In Parliament, in the press, and through broadcasting media. The evidence that there is a causal connection between long continued cigarette smoking and the occurrence of lung cancer, is authoritative, accepted by the Government and hardly disputed. Over the past few, years, between 160 and 180 Islington residents have died from lung cancer each year, approximately 80% of them being males. In the country as a whole, lung cancer is responsible for more deaths than all the fatalities from home and road accidents combined, and yet, the evidence which has not been contrcvjrted so far, shows that the simple avoidance of cigarette smoking is the only preventive measure necessary to obviate the risk of 90% of lung cancer cases. The Ministry of Health in conjunction with the local authorities, proposed additional publicity measures during 1962 Other major health risks are also respiratory in type. Bronchitis and Pneumonia account for a high proportion of the total mortality between them, approximately 400 a year Cigarette smoking is also a major factor in bronchitis, but pollution of the air with smoke is also important. This is being tackled in Islington by the increasing number of smoke control areas in the borough, where the production of smoke through the burning of raw coal is no longer permitted. Housing Reference was made in the 1961 Annual Report to the Housing Act, 1961 the main provisions of which dealt with houses in multiple occupation and these of course comprise the majority of houses in the Borough. In the Housing Section of this Report mention is made of a survey under the Act which was carried out during the year covering over 500 individual houses and flats. Whilst this survey provided valuable information it became apparent that practical problems were likely to arise in connection with the recovery of costs if work in default was done by the Council. The Report also mentions that the Minister of Housing and Local Government confirmed Clearance Area Orders under the Housing Act, 1957, in respect of 44 houses in Pluyford Road 10 houses in Elmore Street and 8 houses in Lonsdale Place. ii Pollution of the Atmosphere The original provisions of the Clean Air Act, 1956, required local authorities to submit to the Minister in considerable detail estimated and final costs of adapting and replacing fireplaces in privately owned dwellings, since such costs have to be approved by the Ministry which bears 40% of the expenditure. During the year, the Minister approved a welcome revised simplified form which greatly reduced administrative requirements and the clerical work on smoke control costings. The Minister also drew attention to solid fuel storage problems, with particular reference in local authority housing. Restricted storage space means that householders are unable to take reasonable advantage of cheaper summer fuel prices. Local authorities were requested to pay particular attention to such storage space which may be required for solid fuel in the plans for new dwellings. Considerable progress was made during the year with the extension of smoke control areas. Six Smoke Control Orders came into operation, and two were confirmed by the Minister. Supervision of Food and Food Hygiene Several new regulations came into operation during the year, strengthening control measures. A number of night inspections were carried out by public health inspectors who paid particular attention to Food and Drugs Act requirements in such premises as refreshment houses and clubs, and also inspected in connection with the transit of meat and milk deliveries to retailers. Food complaints brought to the notice of the Department were again considerable and varied, as may be seen by reference to this Section of the Report. The Report also mentions two instances involving ritual slaughter of animals in private houses. It is hoped that such practices in the circumstances set out can be strongly discouraged. It is regretted that due to staff difficulties during the year, food inspections and food sampling could not be carried out to the extent thought desirable. In spite of the personnel problem, however, the Report lists a number of cases in which successful legal action was taken in respect of either food or food premises. Elderly Persons An important measure in 1962 was the passing of the National Assistance Act, 1948 (Amendment) Act which now permits local authorities to make arrangements for recreation and meals for old people, either directly or through voluntary organisations as agencies Local authorities were hitherto restricted to giving assistance to voluntary bodies. Whilst a good deal of most valuable voluntary work is done which is of considerable help to elderly persons, there are limitations to the amount of voluntary help which is available. The new Act, it is hoped, will permit additions to the services which will amplify and extend existing help. Among the Department's own activities are the arrangements for the cleansing and bathing of elderly persons, both in their own homes for those who are unable to leave their accommodation and for others at the Treatment Centre, Seven Sisters Road, The Council approved a modernisation scheme for the Centre on which work commenced during the year. Special fitments,shower compartments and other additions should greatly ease the work in connection with the bathing of elderly persons, both for the persons themselves and for the attendants. The Report also, as usual, gives some details of personal problems which may, unfortunately, be encountered with some elderly persons and the means which had to be taken either compulsorily or in other cases with persuasion, help, liaison with interested persons and statutory bodies, in order to obtain some improvement in circumstances and give more ease to the final years. iii Staff and General I again have pleasure in giving mention to the personal aspect, since the Department must do its work as a team, but my thanks in particular, are expressed to Dr. J.P.J. Burns, Deputy Medical Officer of Health, to Mr. W.C. Bartlett and Mr. H. Plinston, Chief and Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector respectively, and Mr. E.J. Sharp, Chief Clerk. It has become customary in recent Reports to refer to the good liaison which is present between the Borough's Health Department and Health Division 3 of the London County Council which covers Islington in respect of the personal health services. I must, therefore, again express my thanks to Dr. Wilfrid G. Harding as Divisional Medical Officer, and to his staff for their continued co-operation which is taken for granted in everyday practice. I should again like to express my thanks to Alderman A.J. Rogers, Chairman of the Public Health Committee, and to Alderman E.J.W. Bayliss of the Housing Committee, and to the members of these Committees, to which the work of the Public Health Department is principally reported, for their continued courtesy and careful consideration of the many and sometimes contentious matters which I placed before them during the past year.

Prior to the Census Return, the Registrar General's estimates showed a .small decreases in population every year since 1951. It would seem that this trend has now been reversed for the time bsing at least. The Annual Report for 1961 contained the preliminary report of the 1961 Census The Fegistrar General's more detailed County of London rtepcrc was received in the early part of 1963, and the following further Returns from this Report can therefore now be given.

The Census Return shows that the Barnsbury and St, Peter Wards are the most congested of all The principal immigrant populations have also been given in the Census Return as shown in the following figures for those born in the territories indicated The corresponding figures for the County of London are also given: Commonwealth Countries. Colonies & Protectorates Cyprus India Pakistan Caribbean Territories* County of London 26,308 24,592 4,518 70,523 Islington 9,114 1,230 228 7,916 *Including British Guiana, Jamaica, Trinidad & Tobago and others 10 Bi rths The 1961 Report stated that the birthrate 23.8 per 1,000 population was for the first time greater than that in 1947, the peak year of the post war "bulge at 23.55 As anticipated in last year's Report, the increase continued and in 1962, there was a new high birthrate peak at 25.4 per 1,000 population. The high illegitimate birthrate of 1961 of 13.6 per cent. was exceeded in 1962 when 15.7 per cent. of all births were classified as illegitimate. In this connection, it was mentioned that it would repay further study of the population groups contributing to this high illegitimacy rate and its socio-medico significance. The desirability of such a study is emphasised further by the record proportion of illegitimate infants born being not far short of one-sixth of all live births Children under 15 years of age The following table (extracted from the Registrar General's Returns) gives the estimated number of children under the age of 15 years in the County of London and in Islington: Under 1 year 1 - 4 Total under 5 5 - 14 Total under 15 London Admin. County 59,800 188,400 248,200 377,300 625,500 Islington 5,530 15,670 21,200 27,200 48,400 Deaths The total death rate was fractionally lower than in 1961 in falling from 11.1 to 11.0. Deaths from the respiratory causes of influenza pneumonia and bronchitis were also somewhat lower and the following table is reproduced for the current year showing the seasonal influences affecting deaths due to respiratory causes Under 1 year 1 - 54 55 - 64 65 - 74 75* Total January 3 10 14 28 53 108 February - 2 8 15 40 65 March 5 1 9 9 26 50 April 3 2 3 6 24 38 May - 1 4 4 14 23 June - 1 - 10 4 15 July - - 4 1 9 14 August 2 2 1 3 10 18 Septemlar - 1 1 5 5 12 October - - 2 4 16 22 November 1 - 5 9 15 30 December 5 7 11 14 37 74 It will be seen from the table that deaths due to diseases of the respiratory system as mentioned above are at their maximum during the four winter months December to March inclusive, and more particularly, December and January This is a regular winter occurrence, and it will also be noted that it is the elderly, that is, those over 75 years of age, who suddenly become exposed to a major increase in risk with the temperature fall and other adverse weather conditions from December onwards. The 11 problem of adequate space heating for elderly persons is referred to further in the section of this report dealing with the elderly. Deaths of infants under one year The infant mortality rate of 19.1 for 1962 is the lowest ever recorded, with the solar' exception of 1954 when the rate was 17 per thousand live births. Prom one to twelve months the greatest risk to infants is due to respiratory disease, particularly pneumonia. Of a total of 26 deaths in this age group, 11 were due to pneumonia and bronchitis. Maternal Mortality There were three maternal deaths during the year compared with seven in 1961. It was noted in the last report that five of the seven deaths were consequent upon abortion. It is satisfactory to record that, in 1962, only one of the three deaths was attributable to this cause. Respiratory Tuberculosis The continued downward trend of deaths from lung tuberculosis, which was interrupted in 1961, was fortunately resumed in 1962, when the rate dropped from 0.10 per thousand population to 0.06. The decreased risk of mortality was also combined with another drop in the number of new cases commented upon elsewhere in this report, and confirms that the problem of tuberculosis is at any rate being reduced even if in areas such as Islington there is still a considerable way to go before it becomes a negligible problem. Malignant Growths of Lung and Bronchus The comment was made in last year's report that the 144 deaths due to this group of causes which occurred in 1961 was the first break in the regular year by year increase in males since 1955. At 144 male deaths in 1962, there was an increase of three over 1961, but the number of deaths in wonen at 22 was seven less than the previous year. Deaths in men due to lung cancer affects the middle aged rather than the more elderly. 55 per cent. of the deaths occurred in men under the age of 65 years.

The case had not visited Islington, but the public were very concerned with smallpox in the early part of 1962, and it was mentioned in the 1961 Report also that although there was substantial demand for mass vaccination the view of the Ministry of Health continued to be that in the circumstances, the procedure of intensive tracing of all possible contacts and suspects together with immediate vaccination or re-vaccination of such persons should suffice to contain any possible spread. As might be expected, there was an increase in the number of references for suspected smallpox and supervision if possible of smallpox contacts The precautions taken where suspected rashes were reported also involved precautionary measures which gave rise to substantial inconvenience at a local hospital A man aged 32 years arrived unannounced at the Casualty Department on account of feeling unwell and having a rash. The Medical Officer of Health was informed and all admissions to the hospital were temporarily suspended. The Deputy Medical Officer of Health visited the hospital and was of the opinion that this was not a case of smallpox, which permitted the re-opening of the hospital. Information was received in mid-May that a ship had arrived at Liverpool from India and the Middle East. Two passengers who boarded the ship at Bombay, father and child, developed rashes and mild smallpox was diagnosed at Suez. The two patients and their family were disembarked at Suez. The surgeon vaccinated everybody on board the following day. Three contacts in one family who travelled in this ship were visited by staff of this Department and kept under surveillance for the incubation period Another case of suspected modified smallpox was reported in an Asian boy aged 3 years. The ship on which he was travelling arrived at Gravesend from Bombay in mid August and the child was admitted to the Port of London Isolation Hospital, A passenger on the ship, resident in Islington, was re-vaccinated and kept under surveillance for the routine period. Information was received at the end of October that a male Malayan passenger, aged 22 years, who boarded a steamship at Singapore was diagnosed at Suez as suffering from modified smallpox and was removed to hospital ashore. All passengers and crew were vaccinated or re-vaccinated. Six passengers were reported resident in Islington and were kept under surveillance. Twelve patients were referred by family practitioners to the Medical Officer of Health or his Deputy as suffering from rashes of a type where it was desirable to exclude smallpox as a possible cause. Eight of these were confirmed as cases of chickenpox, one as shingles two cases were diagnosed as not smallpox and the remaining case proved to be one of Eczema Vaccinatum The last mentioned case was a girl aged 7 years suffering from a rash and severely ill. She was admitted to hospital and following laboratory tests, the diagnosis made was that the rash was caused by Vaccinia in a child who had been subject to eczema from infancy The only traceable source for the transmission of Vaccinia was a child who had been recently vaccinated and sat next to the patient at school. It has long been appreciated by doctors that eczematous children should not be vaccinated under normal conditions but coincidences such as occurred here could hardly be foreseen and fortunately, the child affected made a good recovery. 16 The following is the table of successful vaccinations performed over the past fifteen years:- 1st fonuary . 3rd July 1948 1,124 5th July - 31st December 1948 702 1949 1,628 1950 2,307 1951 3,291 1952 2,450 1953 3,055 1954 4,052* 1955 5,942* 1956 2,590* 1957 3,624* 1958 3, 449* 1959 2,692* 1960 2,753* 1961 3,782* 1962 32,795 (Figures kindly furnished by Divisional Medical Officer, London County Council) *Including Re-vaccinations Group Sessions for Schoolchildren discontinued The Vaccination Acts were rescinded under the National Health Service Act, 1946, as from 5th July, 1948. Certificatee of Vaccination and Inoculation - Authentication - Ministry of Health Circular 60/48 Applications for authentication to be dealt with by the Medical Officer of Health numbered 3,361 as against 730 for the previous year. The applications comprise requests for authentication of International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation against smallpox, cholera, typhoid, etc. and constitute a substantial item of work The certificates of course, are required for travel abroad. The sharp rise in the numbers authenticated over the previous year was due to the special requirements of several of the European countries, introduced as a result of the outbreaks of smallpox in England and Wales, which occurred at the beginning of the year. Measles and Whooping Cough Measles and Whooping Cough became generally notifiable in London at the end of 1939. Prior to this there was only a limited notification. 17 Measles The number of cases notified in i962 was 1,314. This was a quiet year for measles, which was not unexpected 1961 having been the year with the highest recorded number of notified cases of measles - 3,310. Most of the cases represented the start of a new outbreak which commenced in October and continued into 1963 The greater majority of cases were relatively mild and uncomplicated but 37 were referred to hospital. There was no instance fortunately, in which measles led to death. The following table shows the age groups of the notified cases during 1962:- Under 1 year 1 - 5 5 years and uowards No. of Notifications in 1962 52 734 528 Percentage of total Notifications 4.0 55.9 40.1 No. ot Deaths - - - 18 Whooping Cough Only 51 notifications of Whooping Cough were received during 1962 which is even less than for the previous year which was then the lowest on record The age groups are as follows:- Dnder 1 year 1 - 5 5 years and upwards No. of Notifications in 1962 11 25 15 Percentage of total notifications No of Deaths 6 49 0 29,4 19 Fatality Rates per 1,000 notifications each age group (1953 - 1962) Percentage of notifications (1953 - 1962) Under ] Measles1.19 Whooping Oough 3.36 1 - 5 .09 0.86 5 & upwards 0.12 - Under 1 4.0 13.3 1 - 5 56.7 52.1 5 & upwards 39.3 34.6 Whooping Cough Prophylaxis Whooping cough immunisation is carried out in the Local Health Authority Clinics and by general practitioners.

This is most gratifying, although it is certainly not an indication that immunisation against this infection can be relaxed, as the occurrance last year of a limited outbreak and the discovery of some carriers proved. Diphtheria Immunisation, 1962 Dr.Wilfrid G. Harding, Divisional Medical Officer, London County Council, has kindly supplied the following figures on page 22 in respect of Islington for the current year As immunity tends to wane with the passage of time, the Immunity Index relates only to children who have been inoculated during the last 5 years by general practioners, and in L.C.C. Welfare Centres and Schools. This is consonant with the Immunity Index given by the Ministry of Health, 22 Age at 31. 12. 62 i. e. born in year Under 1 1962 1 - 4 1961 58 Last complete course (whether primary or boost) 1958 - 62 2,262 13,418 Mid-year population 5,530 15,670 Immunity Index 40.9 85.6 Food Poisoning Number of notifications received 1947 7 1948 10 1949 55 1950 104 1951 148 1952 58 1953 243 1954 104 1955 294 1956 141 1957 150 1958 183 1959 164 1960 131 1961 119 1962 67 In accordance with Circular 2/50 of the Ministry of Health the following table summarises the outbreaks of food poisoning and the character of each outbreak:â Date No. of Notifications No. of persons served No, of cases reported No. of deaths Foods involved and Organisms responsible 1. 20,6.62 â 92 12 - Tinned Pilchards:Staphylococcal Infection 2. 6.10.62 10 650 15 14 (Known non- Islington Residents) â Scotch Eggs & Ham Sandwiches :Salmonella bredeney 3. 18.10.62 2 34 17 â Steak & Kidney Pie Mandarins & custard: Salmonella bredeney A detailed analysis is shown on the following page 23 1. Information was received in mid-June of two teachers and ten children who were ill with symptoms which included abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea These occurred between half an-hour and five hours after eating a school dinner The illness lasted 12-72 hours and was of a slight to moderate character. The suspected meal consisted of luncheon meat or corned beef and pilchards, salad and potatoes, golden pudding or chocolate pudding and custard, and was eaten by 79 school children and 13 members of the staff at this school. Pood was prepared at another school and transported to the school where the outbreak occurred. Two other schools were supplied with similar meals from the same kitchen - no illness was reported amongst children in these schools. All those affected were found to have eaten the tinned pilchards as a part of their meal. Twelve cases were reported, and it would appear that this was probably a staphylococcal infection occurring in one isolated tin after sterilisation Examination of the school kitchen was reported by the Public Health Inspector as being in excellent condition and, on examination, benches, equipment and utensils were found to be very clean. Examination of food samples and faecal specimens showed no pathogenic organisms present. 2. Information was received in mid-October of possible cases of food poisoning that had attended a Wedding reception at a hall in the Borough occasionally used for receptions. It appears that 650 guests attended this reception from near and fax (the bride and groom coming from South London). It is difficult to establish how many were ill as no record of the guests was available but one source believed that as many as 40 were taken ill after the reception. The meal consisted of Scotch eggs, ham sandwiches, bridge rolls, blackcurrant fruit tarts, fresh fruit salad, fruit and tomatoes, cheese flavoured biscuits and coffee The meal was consumed between 1 and 1.30 p.m. Symptoms, mainly diarrhoea and abdominal pains, were felt by some at 6 p. m. and by others from that time onwards for the next forty-eight hours. Of the 21 Islington guests investigated 10 out of 12 symptoms were found positive for salmonella bredeney, and 3 out of 9 asymptomatic were also positive. Fourteen guests living in other areas were investigated - 9 out of 14 with symptoms were found positive for salmonella bredeney As ham had been identified with other salmonella bredeney infections it is assumed that ham, either in the form of ham sandwiches or used as part cooking of Scotch eggs, was responsible for the outbreak. The ham used in both cases came from different sources Further enquiries failed to link any direct evidence with the hams and the organism causing infection, but there is substantial evidence incriminating the Scotch eggs 3. Information also was received in mod October from the Registrar of a Hospital in the Borough that some student nurses and radiographers had been ill after consuming a meal at the Annexe to the hospital 24 34 students ate lunch consisting of steak and kidney pie manderins and custard and a number were ill during the night, mainly with diarrhoea. One of these, however, had vomited and had abdominal pain. The total number who became ill was 17, one of whom a staff nurse was admitted to an isolation hospital with salmonella bredeney infection One other student had severe symptoms and was admitted to the sick bay. . Laboratory investigation was carried out at the Hospital including examination of 4 samples of ham, also swabs from the chopping boards and the refrigerator but with negative result. Examination of faecal specimens from the remainder of the students were also negative. The origin of infection in this outbreak was not discovered These three outbreaks were all reported to the Ministry of Health as required in their Memo," 188/Med./1958. 25 Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fever Four cases of Typhoid and two of Paratyphoid Fever were confirmed during the year, The first case, a girl aged 10 years, was admitted to hospital with suspected Meningitis and was subsequently diagnosed as suffering from Typhoid Fever, The source of infection, although not definitely ascertained, was probably shellfish. The second case, a girl aged 3 years, was admitted to hospital with suspected Dysentery, and was subsequently found to be suffering from Typhoid Fever This child had returned from Cyprus some 2 months prior to onset and it was considered that the source of infection was almost certainly there Three contacts were employed as food handlers and a fourth was employed in a hospital, all in other Boroughs. The Medical Officers of Health of the Boroughs concerned were kept fully informed until bacteriological clearance was obtained. A female aged 17 years was admitted to hospital with suspected typhoid fever, which was confirmed. This patient had returned from Italy a few days prior to onset of symptoms. Two of the contacts were food handlers; one employed in another Borough and the other contact employed as a Food Mixing Machine Operator with Food Producers in the Borough. By arrangement he was temporarily put on other work until bacteriologically cleared. Information was received of, a male, aged 33 years, who was admitted to hospital and found to be suffering from Typhoid Fever. The patient and family had been on holiday in Italy and returned to England by sea and rail a week prior to onset of symptoms The usual domiciliary enquiries were carried out and routine bacteriological investigations of contacts proved negative. Two family contacts were found to be employed as food handlers in another Borough and the Medical Officer of Health concerned was kept informed. The patient was also a food handler - a Baker - working in another Borough and the Medical Officer of Health of that Borough was duly informed Finally, a girl aged 4 years was admitted to hospital with suspected Typhoid Fever and was subsequently found to be suffering from Paratyphoid ""B" Fever (phage type "Dundee"). The patient and family had been on holiday in Cyprus and returned to England by sea and rail, via Venice, some twoweeks previously Routine bacteriological investigations showed that the mother of the patient was a positive carrier of paratyphoid and she was also admitted to hospital for treatment. Bacteriological results of other family and residential contacts were negative One family contact was found to be employed as a food handler in another Borough and the Medical Officer of Health concerned was kept informed. Information was received of a ship arriving at Southampton from South Africa at the end of July. A tourist class steward was admitted to hospital the next day and was found to be suffering from Typhoid Fever He was reported to have been ill for at least 5 days (possibly up to 21 days) before arrival at Southampton, but was on duty. Five contacts of this case were reported proceeding to addresses in Islington Domiciliary enquiries were made, and bacteriological specimens examined from four of these contacts were found to be negative. The other contact, who was a crew member, returned to the ship before he could be interviewed The Port Medical Officer of Health, Southampton Docks, was informed. Information was received of a child who was admitted to an L C.C Children" s Home in another Borough and was later removed to a hospital where it was confirmed she was suffering from Typhoid Fever. Seven contacts resident in Islington were reported Domiciliary enquiries were made and routine bacteriological examinations were all negative, except for the aunt of the case who was discovered to be a carrier of Flexner 1B Dysentery 26 Dysentery The incidence of Dysentery in 1962 (369 cases) was slightly higher than in 1961 when there were 334 cases. From the detailed analysis it will be noted that 146 cases (40%) were under 5 years and 124 cases (34%) of school age. The infecting organism in nearly all casis is Shigella Sonnei, and the illness is rarely severe or dangerous. This distribution is due to the fact that the main outbreaks occurred in 2 Islington schools and one day nursery, although many of the cases in the under 5 year age group are discovered having had a mild short-term illness when domiciliary enquiry of school cases is being carried out It will be seen from the dysentery table on page 27 that arising out of the enquiries made, 19 dysentery cases were found to be employed as food handlers and 75 were food handlers who were direct or indirect contacts of dysentery cases Although most of the cases which have occurred recently are not due to food infection food infected with the dysentery organism could be a potential risk and precautions, there fore, have to be taken accordingly in such cases As an example of a problem that arose in this connection, it was found that a school kitchen meals helper was a carrier of Sonne Dysentery and she was, of course excluded from this work in accordance with the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960. It was also found that her husband was a milk roundsman and exclusion measures were taken in his case under the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1959. 27 DYSENTERY IN ISLINGTON - 1962 Month 1962 No. of Cases Notified Coming to knowledge Confirmed Cases Sex AGE GROUPS Cases employee as food handlers Food Handler Contacts Water Closet Accommodation 0- 1- 5- 15- 25- 45- 65- Same family Separate family Separate Shared January 19 15 4 15 M . â 4 â 1 2 2 â 4 4 â â 19 F â 4 3 1 2 â â February 7 6 1 â M â 3 2 â 1 â â â 5 1 2 5 F 1 â â â â â â March 7 6 1 3 M â 2 1 â â 1 1 1 â â 4 3 F â 1 â â â 1 â April 11 6 5 9 M 1 2 2 â 1 â â 1 â â 5 6 F â 2 â â 2 1 â May 41 33 8 34 M 4 11 5 â 3 1 â 1 2 5 19 22 F â 6 4 4 3 â â June 36 32 4 21 M 1 6 5 â 4 2 â 4 10 8 20 16 F â 5 4 2 6 1 â July 40 24 16 33 M 2 8 13 â 3 1 â 1 8 9 19 21 F 1 7 1 2 2 â â August 28 14 14 25 M 1 2 3 â 1 â â â â â 9 19 F 1 11 6 â 2 1 â September 27 19 8 22 M 1 3 5 â 1 1 â 1 1 2 18 9 F 2 5 5 1 2 1 â October 29 24 5 16 M 3 4 7 â â 1 â â â â 18 11 F 1 2 7 â 4 â â November 34 31 3 23 M 5 3 5 â 2 2 â 2 10 4 19 15 F 2 3 4 3 5 â â December 90 51 39 83 M 3 14 21 1 5 1 â 4 5 1 52 38 F 1 8 21 3 5 5 2 TOTAL 369 261 108 284 M 21 62 69 2 23 12 1 19 45 30 185 184 F 9 54 55 16 33 10 2 28 29 Tuberculosis The number of deaths from Tuberculosis of the lungs fell from 22 in 1961 to 13 in 1962, the lowest total on record.

Brett, Physician - in-Charge of the Mass X-Ray Unit sited at Drayton Park has kindly agreed to the following inclusion from his report which reviews the work of the Unit. The Centre was officially opened in February 1952. It was originally intended to provide X-Ray facilities for all those living and working in the Borough of Islington. Within a year, however, practitioners in many neighbouring boroughs were also making use of the facilities of the Centre. The following is extracted from Dr. Brett's Report:- Static X-Ray Centre TABLE A ISLINGTON NON-ISLINGTON TOTAL Men Women Men Women No. x-rayed 6, 560 5,971 8,282 6 865 27,678 No. of Cases 68 26 41 17 152 Rate per 1,000 10.0 4.3 4.9 2.5 5.5 TOTAL 7.5 3.8 5.5 An analysis as under has been done of British born and other ethnic groups who attended in the Static Centre in Islington. The highest incidence of Tuberculosis was found in Irish born men. For the first time Asians and West Africans were recorded separately. The incidence rates in small samples of these groups were high The increase in Tuberculosis among West Indian men observed in 1961, was confirmed in 1962 On the whole the non-British born contingent formed under 25% of all examinees and yielded about 42% of active Tuberculosis, TABLE B No. x-rayed No. of Cases Rate per 1000 Men Women Men Women Men Women British-born 11,040 9, 867 62 25 5.6 2.5 Irish 985 991 18 6 18 0 6.0 Cypriots 442 302 6 3 13.5 10.0 West Indians 943 799 9 3 10.0 3.7 Indians 231 121 4 3 17.0 25.0 Pakistanis 101 12 1 â 10.0 - West Africans 346 151 5 1 14.0 6.0 Others 754 593 4 2 5.3 3.4 Total Non British born 3,802 2,969 47 18 12.3 6.0 32 Conclusions: The figures for 1962 and the past 3 years showed that no decrease in casefinding has taken place and that optimistic forecasts of eradication are premature and indeed misleading. Tuberculosis Care Committee The London County Council is responsible for care and after care work under Section 28 of the National Health Service Act, 1946 but the Islington Tuberculosis Care Committee remains in being, working in conjunction with the Islington Chest Clinic, and Members of the Borough Council and the Medical Officer of Health serve on this Committee. The Tuberculosis Care Committee is able to assist patients in many ways, including the provision of extra nourishment, while loans of beds, bedding and medical appliances were made to 4 patients from the L.C.C. loan stock, others were referred to various organisations for assistance, The Care Committee administers an occupational therapy service with occupational therapists employed by the L.C.C. The following figures show the service being provided in a typical week: No. of sessions of instructions in homes during a week 18 No. of patients receiving instruction at home 45 Scabies and Vermin As will be seen from the following table, there are still a considerable number of cases of scabies, itch, and also vermin infestations These conditions which are dealt with at the Council's Treatment Centre year after year are closely related to personal hygiene. Many families can maintain reasonable standards of personal hygiene under adverse housing conditions, but this must sometimes be quite difficult. A very large number of homes in Islington, and an even larger number of families, have not the use of a hot water point from which hot water is immediately available when required. Approximately one-half of the houses in Islington have no bath, and these deficiencies in personal washing and cleansing facilities, combined with the high proportion of congested family accommodation in the Borough, certainly make the attainment of a reasonable standard of personal cleanliness much more difficult than it need be Of the adults treated for verminous conditions, a substantial proportion are in the elderly who, apart from not having the washing facilities available, are also selfneglectful in varying degrees.

Bartlett. Chief Public Health Inspector). The fact that the establishment of Public Health Inspectors was under strength is reflected in the work which it has been possible to carry out during the year under review. This shortage particularly affected certain sections as will be observed by reference to the statistics in this report. Although a number left the service of the Council several were recruited and the situation by the end of the year had improved Added to those appointed from other Authorities, one of the Students engaged in the Department qualified and was subsequently appointed. It has not been possible to add to the number of students receiving training in the Department due to the shortage of Inspectors, but it is anticipated that if the present Inspectorate can be retained student training could be increased. It is a matter of regret that systematic inspection of property and food undertakings including sampling could not be undertaken With the passing of the Housing Act, 1961, it was hoped that the conditions under which many of the residents in the Borough lived could be improved. A survey of houses in multiple occupation is being undertaken but the Statute has proved difficult to implement. The Factories Act 1961 which repeals the 1937 Statute came into force in April this year. The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1962 empowers inter alia a Borough Council to serve Notices for the prevention of flooding in respect of any building not adequately drained into a sewer by gravity at all times and under all conditions of flow. The Council are empowered to close the building or part of it or to restrict its use if they are satisfied that remedial works cannot be carried out at reasonable expense In any other case they must require the carrying out of remedial works or if necessary do the work themselves in default. The Act also defines those refreshment houses, in respect of which the Council can require the provisions of sanitary conveniences under the 1959 Act as meaning any building in which food or drink is sold to and consumed by the Public. The powers of the Council under this part of the Act have been delegated to the Public Health Committee. During the year the Home Secretary issued - 1. The Oil Heater Regulations 1962, 2. The Poisons List Order 1962. 3. The Poisons Rules 1962. With regard to Smoke Control areas, the Minister of Housing and Local Government issued three circulars, i. e. (a) Circular 3/62 in which he outlines various changes in procedure which will make it easier for Local Authorities to carry through their Smoke Control Programmes more quickly 35 (b) Circular 5/62 dealing with fuel storage in new Local Authority housing and (c) Circular 60/62 in which the Minister requests Authorities to consider whether the making of Smoke Control Orders could not be expedited and urging Authorities to get on with this work in order that the present programme may be completed without undue delay Towards the end of 1962, the severe cold snap began to cause hardships which continued well into 1963. The conditions which arose due to frozen water services could in many cases have been obviated had the public taken quite simple precautions in protecting the domestic supply. Much of the inconvenience caused was due to the service pipes being inadequately protected and the fact that water closets were situated outside Tenants should be aware of the position of the stop-cock and ensure that it is in working order. Taps should not be allowed to drip and a little salt placed in the water closet and gully traps would have prevented the water content from freezing Problems connected with some groups of immigrants continue to be brought to the notice of the Department. Difficulties may be experienced in getting the powers and duties regarding overcrowding and nuisance abatement to be understood There is a tendency for work to be carried out without Notice of intention being given where plans are required and prior approval necessary. The Inspectors find drainage and other work completed in contravention of the Byelaws and great difficulty may be experienced in tracing the builder or person concerned in order to get the matter put right. Whilst individual cleanliness is general, parts in common use such as the yard and sanitary conveniences, need frequent supervision. Many houses are let off in furnished rooms and the tenants who so often pay high rents do not complain through fear of eviction or do not appreciate the Council's powers to assist them. Inspectors are required to carry out an increasing number of inspections after normal working hours, the tenants not being home during the day The Statutory duties of the Inspector have to be performed with tact and persistence for domiciliary inspections are often resented and in fact in some cases he meets with a hostile reception. In addition language difficulties occur, for immigrants cannot or will not understand the English language and Inspectors are sometimes regarded with suspicion Vacant sites, derelict property and static water tanks continue to be a source of complaint but conditions were improved as far as possible in each case Continual supervision is necessary to ensure that nuisances are kept to a minimum Summary of Work done by District Public Health Inspectors (i) Inspections Houses/flats inspected under Public Health (London) Act, 1936 4,519 Separate lettings 10,183 Revisits Houses/flats 11455 Separate lettings 26,062 36 (ii) Other inspections and visits Miscellaneous 3,751 Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 99 Infectious Diseases 268 National Assistance Acts, 1948 and 1951 (Aged & Infirm) 20 Factories Act, 1961 - Outworkers 317 Pet Animals Act, 1951 75 Consumer Protection Act, 1961, and Regulations 56 Noise Nuisances 75 Food Premises 591 Housing Act, 1961 (Houses in Multiple occupation) 596 Non-effective visits 3,667 (iii) Nuisances and Notices Notices served - Public Health (London) Act, 1936 (a) Intimation 2,379 (b) Statutory 1,183 Notices complied with - Public Health (London) Act, 1936 (a) Intimation 1,321 (b) Statutory 4,647 Nuisances found 4,129 Nuisances abated 5,142 Number of houses improved 1,810 Separate letting in above ??? 1,888 Total number of improvements to dwelling houses 4,697 (iv) Legal Proceedings Informations prepared 71 Abatement Orders made by Magistrate 22 Abatement Orders complied with 7 Further Proceedings for disobedience of Abatement Orders 1 (v) Drainage Plans examined 312 Examinations and Tests 192 (vi) Complaints Outstanding (at end of 1961) 245 Received during the year 3,578 plus 337 repeated complaints Dealt with during year 3,614 Outstanding (at end of 1962) 209 (vii) Land Charges Act, 1925 Enquiries received 3 137 Properties involved 3,796 Investigations 3,796 (viii) Rent Act, 1957 Applications for Certificates of Disrepair (1) Number of applications for certificates during 1962 13 Number of applications brought forward from 1961 â Number of applications carried forward to 1962 â Total number of applications receiving attention 1962 13 37 (2) Number of decisions not to issue certificates 4 Number of Undertakings on Form 'K' accepted 4 (3) Number of decisions to issue certificates 9 (a) in respect of some but not all defects 4 (b) in respect of all defects 5 (4) Number of Undertakings given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule 5 (5) Number of Undertakings refused by Local Authority under proviso to paragraph 5 of the First Schedule 1 (6) Number of certificates issued where undertakings not accepted 1 Applications for Cancellation of Certificates (7) Applications by landlords to Local Authority for cancellation of certificates 22 Number of applications brought forward from 1961 2 Number of applications carried forward to 1963 1 Total number of applications receiving attention 1962 23 (8) Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates 8 (9) Decisions by Local Authority to cancel in spite of tenant's objection Nil (10) Certificates cancelled by Local Authority 14 Applications by Overseas Companies for Certificates of Repair Applications received Nil Certificates issued Nil (ix) Improvements effected as a result of Service of Notices under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. 1.

This has a number of advantages. In addition, authority was given to the Public Health Department to endeavour to clear drains before referring the case to the Borough Engineer.

Disinfection and Disinfestation (a) General Number of rooms disinfected after cases of infectious disease 357 Number of rooms treated for vermin 1,099 Number of rooms included in the above figure treated for vermin (free of charge) 229 (The majority of free cases were carried out on behalf of elderly or infirm persons or persons of limited means ) The department also undertook the disinfection of wards in a number of hospitals upon request for co-operation in the control of hospital infection In addition the routine disinfection of pillows and woollen blankets from a hospital in the Borough continued for the purpose of reducing the likelihood of infection,. particularly of staphylococcal infection. 2,238 bags containing blankets and pillows were disinfected in accordance with an agreed procedure. 33 visits were paid by the Public Health Inspector to a factory to supervise the treatment of 2,393 bales of clothing and other material for export. The total weight of bales treated was 90 tons 8 cwt 41 The cleansing of articles in rooms occupied by elderly or infirm persons often creates a problem. The conditions are such that volunteers are sought from the Disinfecting Station staff, who undertake the appropriate cleansing after normal working hours. (b) Steam Disinfection 3,872 articles of clothing or bedding were steam disinfected. (c) Fly and Other Infestations Anti-Ply Treatment at Ashburton Grove Depot commenced on 15th June and continued during the summer months. The evidence of infestation was slight and due to inclement weather the treatment was somewhat erratic, Dr, Parkin and his staff at the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research again gave practical assistance and advice in the treatment of this Depot and it was considered that the present method of control is the most effective. The Council's Housing Estates were again treated for red clover mite, complaints having been received from 12 blocks of flats during the season. Various insecticides were used. In 1961 Dr. Parkin arranged for a detailed treatment to be carried out in 4 blocks using Kelthane. These particular blocks showed very few clover mites in May this year, The co-operation of Dr. Parkin and members of his staff is appreciated Seven complaints of wasps were received during the year all of which were investigated and the nests destroyed One nest was extensive and was situated in a cavity of the brickwork in the flank wall of a house A builder who was working at the premises discovered this nest and it was necessary for the inner course of brickwork to be removed at top floor level from the floor to the ceiling. The colony was destroyed, the nest removed and the brickwork re-instated. During the year a large infestation of Narcerdes Melanura (Wood beetle) occurred in a block of Council flats and adjoining property This particular beetle inhabits damp places and as the premises are near the New River Gardens it was considered that the infestation may have arisen from this source,. This was not proved and upon treatment with 5% D.D,T. powder the infestation died away eventually (d) Static Water Tanks - Air-Raid Shelters Bouib damaged sites etc. As vacant sites in the Borough are being redeveloped the nuisance arising from the tipping of refuse, etc. is decreasing. There are however still some sites in respect of which complaints continue to be received, The tipping of refuse and the accumulation of water in static water tanks still present a problem Upon application from the Public Health Inspector the Cleansing Superintendent arranges for the removal by his Department, of any putrescible matter Stagnant water is pumped out by the London Fire Brigade whose co-operation is appreciated One particular static water tank received press publicity and was a source of constant nuisance. Although emptied of refuse and water, it was not long before further complaints were received due to refuse etc. again being deposited, and rain water partly filling the tank Notices are displayed where possible drawing the attention of the Public to the fact that the depositing of refuse on War damaged sites is an offence Visits paid to bomb damaged sites 266 Visits to air-raid shelters and static water tanks 65 Inspections of derelict buildings 98 42 Atmospheric Pollution Clean Air Act 1956 The Minister of Housing and Local Government issued Circular No 3/62 in which he indicated that the estimated and final costs of adapting and replacing fire places in privately owned dwellings would not be normally required to be submitted in the detail hitherto required in future. The Minister's revised simplified form has greatly reduced the clerical work on costings of Smoke Control Areas. In Circular 50/62 the Minister referred to the current requirements for storage of solid fuel in Local Authority Housing. He drew attention to representations which had been received on the difficulties which a strict adherence to these minimum fuel storage requirements might create in Smoke Control Areas because of the greater bulk per ton of coke and other smokeless fuels. With restricted storage, householders may have difficulty in stocking adequate supplies of the fuels they must use. and cannot take full advantage of cheaper deliveries in summer. The Minister is satisfied that the standards now enforced represent a reasonable minimum of fuel storage for most areas, and that there is no case for requiring a higher standard everywhere. He therefore asks authorities when considering the plans of new dwellings in areas covered or likely to be covered by Smoke Control Orders, to give particular attention to this point and to satisfy themselves that the fuel storage facilities are adequate for the type of fuel that may have to be used The Minister in Circular 60/62 drew attention to the programmes submitted by Local Authorities for the black areas (which includes London) and urged that the present programme be completed on time. During the year six Smoke Control Orders came into operation and two were confirmed by the Minister which will not become operative until next year The operation of Snoke Control Orders is proceeding smoothly and it became possible during the year to enlarge the Kings Cross area No. 1 from 39 8 acreas to 104 acres and it is anticipated that the whole of the Borough will be a Smokeless area by 1970. A map of the Borough showing the programme appears on Page 43 The Council authorised the attendance of one of the Public Health Inspectors engaged on Smoke Control areas at a three-day course held by the Coal Utilization Council. This course is arranged in order that those concerned may be fully acquainted with approved appliances and the correct method of fixing same in order to comply with the statutory requirements Several complaints were received by the Department arising from the burning of rubbish in gardens and on vacant land. These complaints are generally resolved upon a visit being paid by the Inspector Certain complaints, however, concerned the burning of industrial waste in factory yards, the burning of motor car bodies and the burning of old timber by demolition contractors. A serious nuisance was caused during the demolition of a large cinema but in all these cases the Inspector took appropriate action and secured abatement of the nuisances concerned The Ministry of Transport by regulations issued during the year made the misuse of the excess fuel device by the driver of a diesel engined vehicle an offence. All new vehicles must have the control device so placed that it cannot be operated by the driver when the vehicle is in motion One factory situated in a Smoke Control area emitted smoke from a combustion stove during December and Legal Proceedings were pending at the end of the year. 43 During the freeze up which commenced on Boxing Day and was still continuing at the end of the year under review, residents in smoke control areas used up their stocks of solid smokeless fuel and difficulties were being experienced in obtaining further supplies. ; The Council is represented on the London and Home Counties Clean Air Advisory Council by Councillor L. Ross and the Medical Officer of Health.

Due to vandalism however, the equipment at York Way Court (Site 2) had to be removed and recording ceased at the end of November Volumetric apparatus is also installed at the Town Hall and the Treatment Centre, Seven Sisters Road, N. 7. The concentration of smoke and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere are recorded daily. The findings are forwarded to the Warren Springs Laboratory for collation and comparison with other Metropolitan Boroughs in order that an overall picture may be obtained for the whole of London A severe smog episode occurred during the evening of 4th December and persisted until the morning of 7th December During this period, arrangements were made for atmospheric pollution readings to be taken at shorter intervals than at the normal 24 hour periods on the Department" s instruments, and similarly, increased readings were taken on the recording instruments in the Borough by the London County Council and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. To summarise the results obtained from all the Recording Stations in the Borough both pollution by smoke and also by sulphur dioxide were very considerably increased The increases varied according to the day or night and also to some extent on the different days of the smog period. Pollution tended to be higher from the early evening onwards and in the morning due, almost certainly, to the banking up of domestic fires about these times. During the four days when smog was present both smoke and sulphur dioxide atmospheric pollution figures increased up to 14 times above the average. A summary of the recordings from the Borough Council sites is set out in the following tables. 45 Monthly Deposits recorded by the Deposit Gauges and Sulphur-Dioxide by the Lead-Peroxide Method Month Site No. Rainfall in inches (Tons per square mile) Mg of SO3/ day collected by 100 sq. cm. of Batch, A lead Peroxide (Louvered Box) Insoluble Deposit Soluble Deposit Total Solids January 1 3.31 11.00 9.07 20.07 2.85 â 2 3.74 14.27 10 04 24.31 3.82 â 3 3.47 6.39 11 27 17.65 4.66 February 1 0.47 6.46 4 90 11.36 3.48 â 2 - No record available - 2.65 â 3 0.55 5.10 2 88 7.98 1.97 March 1 1.65 6.99 2.22 9.21 2.38 â 2 1.50 12 42 4.27 16.69 3.41 â 3 1.42 13.78 4. 14 17.92 3. 55 April 1 2.01 22.16 1.29 23.45 1.41 â 2 1.69 18.15 3.58 21.73 2.03 â 3 1.34 9. 34 2,58 11.92 2.31 May 1 1.18 18.98 7.55 26.53 0.86 â 2 1.42 21.10 6.23 27.33 1.58 â 3 1.26 14 84 5.96 20.80 1.67 June 1 0 28 11.95 3.48 15.43 0.58 â 2 0.32 16.36 3.21 19.57 1.46 â 2 0.20 9,80 2.05 11.85 1.38 July 1 3.47 9.21 9,01 18.22 0.48 â 2 3. 11 11.59 4 04 15.63 1.24 â 3 2.76 7.95 3.59 11.54 1.23 August 1 1.81 10.73 4.47 15.20 0.31 â 2 1.81 11.79 5.93 17.72 1.09 â 3 1.58 6.41 2.99 9.40 1.11 September 1 3.19 9.51 2.58 12.09 0.50 â 2 3.62 15.20 4.84 20.04 1.47 â 3 3.11 9.33 1.51 10.84 1.56 October 1 1.77 5.60 5.80 11.40 1.01 â 2 1.73 8.08 3.94 12.02 2.94 â 3 1.54 11.54 X X 3.11 November 1 1.77 5.70 9.97 15.67 1.98 â 2 No Reading - Rain Guage damaged - â 3 1.62 6.65 8.49 15.14 3. 13 December 1 1.50 8.64 6.00 14.64 3.12 â 2 Use of Station discontinued - â 3 1.18 7.62 6.88 14.50 5 31 These sites are situated at the following places in the Borough: - 1.

Noises also occurred arising from the use of radio and a juke box but upon investigation all complaints were resolved satisfactorily for the time being. A petition was received from residents in one area who complained of noise due to industrial encroachment in the vicinity. The London County Council were informed as it was possible that this encroachment may have been unauthorised. A factory was the subject of a complaint due to the noise from the loud-speaker network. The management was approached and the loud-speaker in question re-sited and the nuisance abated. Arising from complaints received from the use of an extraction fan in a cafe late at night and the banging of car doors in the early hours of the morning two Inspectors kept the premises under observation between 12 40 a.m.and 2 00 a.m. The Inspectors reported that Taxis were coming and going and as many as 43 were parked at one time in the road outside the premises during this period. Noise was confirmed, due to the slamming of doors, talking and the revving up of the engines. The proprietors were cooperative and steps taken to mitigate the nuisance No further complaints have been received. A night visit was paid to another cafe when contravention of the Pood Hygiene Regulations was found. Appropriate action was taken. Investigations were also made into noise arising from the revving up of engines during the early hours of the morning by lorries parked overnight in certain districts Number of complaints received 105 Number of inspections 307 Number of confirmed cases abated 60 Public Health (London) Act, 1936. Section 121 Protection of Birds Act, 1954 Pigeon Nuisances The Council renewed the authority of the Pigeon Catcher and engaged him to give specific treatment where nuisances arose from the congregation of pigeons. Pigeons are frequently encouraged to congregate in certain areas by residents and passers by feeding these birds. 51 In one case a disused lift shaft was occupied by pigeons for nesting purposes. The nuisance was abated by proofing the exterior of the lift shaft with close mesh chicken wire and forming a barrier of similar material at second floor level to prevent the birds entering from the open yard and flying into the shaft. Where it has been necessary for the pigeon catcher to be engaged, the methods used have been in accordance with those approved by the R. S.P.C.A. and the Public Health Inspector is given prior information when the treatment is about to take place. Public Health (London) Act, 1936 (Part IV) Offensive Trades During the year Messrs. J. H. Henson vacated 14/18 Market Road having purchased 22/24 Vale Royal and the site of 26/40 Vale Royal. The Company constructed a more modern building on the site and an Establishment Order was approved by the Council in respect of the trades of a tripe boiler and a fat melter respectively. The Gut Scraping business at 3, Old Slaughter Houses has discontinued. Upon complaints being received it was confirmed that the premises at the rear of 338 Hornsey Road were being used for the business of fat melter. This was unauthorised and upon the Company concerned being informed that they were liable to prosecution, the business ceased and the equipment removed to premises in another Borough which were approved for this purpose. Details of the respective offensive trades in the Borough are as follows - (a) 2 Tripe Boilers: 26/40 Vale Royal, Messrs. J.L. Henson Ltd. 22/24 Vale Royal, Messrs. J.L. Henson Ltd. (b) 1 Knacker: 18/20, Vale Royal - Messrs. Harrison Barber & Co. Ltd. (c) 1 Fur Skin Dresser: 24, Bracey Street - Messrs. J. & A. Fischer Ltd.

(f) 1 Slaughterer: 180, York Way - Messrs. Harrison Barber & Co. Ltd This slaughterhouse was the subject of 282 visits for the inspection of meat. (g) The Council approved the issue of a licence under section 145 in respect of the receiving of carcasses of dead horses for human consumption at 14/16, Vale Royal - Messrs.

Arrangements were made with this Department for the meat in question to be destroyed by incineration and the vehicle which carried the meat to be disinfected. Both were carried out under the personal direction of the County Council Official concerned. Upon completion, Notice of withdrawal was issued and normal work resumed. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933 During the year the Poisons List Order 1962 and the Poisons Rules 1962 were made by the Home Secretary. The Order added inter alia certain substances to the Poisons lists and the Rules imposed appropriate requirements and the restrictions on the sale of special poisons. Number of listed sellers of Part 2 Poisons other than Pharmacists 157 Number of initial registrations during the year 7 Number of visits and inspections 11 Rag Flock and other Filling Materials Act, 1951. Number of premises on register (Section 2, for Upholstery) 50 Number of Licences issued (under section 7 for the Storage of Rag Flock) Nil Number of inspections and visits 40 Consumer Protection Act, 1961 Oil Heater Regulations. 1962 The Oil Heaters Regulations 1962 came into force during the year. These imposed certain requirements in relation to domestic space heaters which burn kerosene (paraffin oil) and are not designed for use with a flue, and subject to certain exemptions no person may sell or let on hire or hire purchase or have in his possession for sale or such letting, any oil heater or a component part of an oil heater not complying with the regulations. 53 Investigations were carried out by the Public Health Inspectors from time to time and any necessary action taken to secure compliance. In one case, the proprietor of a retail shop specialising in oil heaters showed the Inspector specimens of "oil " which he had taken from heaters which had been brought to him for repair. The "oil" was dirty and contained flocculent matter. It had degrees of separation as if the bottles contained water, paraffin and lubricating oil. He contended that vessels used for the storage of paraffin should not be used for any other purpose. The wrong use of paraffin containers was one of the causes of danger in the use of oil heaters.

It is thought that this decrease is due to the use of 1081 in sewer treatments, the result of which is naturally reflected in the occurrence of surface infestations. There were no recorded ship rat infestations. 39 infestations were traced to defective drains and 5 to unsealed disused drains. The situation regarding Municipal Housing Estates has improved. In one case which had proved difficult over a period, the Council carried out the work of investigation and relaid a portion of a defective drain in default. The owner was prosecuted under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, the result of which appears in the table at the end of this Section. Two meetings of No. 1 Workable Area Committee were attended by the phief Public Health Inspector as Chairman and the Rodent Officer.

Water Supplies The Metropolitan Water Board is the responsible Authority for the supply of water to this Borough, The supply is satisfactory both in regard to quality and quantity One sample was taken from the mains supply for chemical analysis and was found to be satisfactory. There are 47,288 dwellings in the Borough supplied directly from water mains which serve a population of 228.345 (Census 1961). Public Health (London) Act, 1936. Section 95 (1) 27 Applications were received for Water Certificates and 27 Certificates were issued in respect of 302 dwellings. (2) 8 Notices were served under this Section requiring the provision of water supplies to tenement houses. 4 water supplies were provided and 12 improved during the year,. (a) Well Water Of the 28 bore-holes or wells known to exist in the Borough 19 continue to be unused being effectively sealed Six of the remaining wells are out of use. Three samples were taken for chemical analysis The results indicated that the water could not be considered free from pollution chemically, However, the water from these bore holes is used solely for industrial purposes. 56 (b) Water Supplies - Miscellaneous Pour samples of sub-soil water were taken. (c) Swimming Bath Water Fifteen samples were taken for bacteriological examination. All were reported to be satisfactory. By courtesy of the Chief Superintendent and Engineer of Baths and Wash-houses the following information is included in this year's report. There are six Swimming Pools at present under the control of the Council. The Swimming Bath at Hornsey Road is being reconstructed. Upon completion, which it is hoped will be in 1963, there will be two Swimming Baths at this establishment. The Metropolitan Water Board supply the water for these Baths:- The method of treatment for purification is by chemical dosage: alumina ferric is the coagulant used to fulfil the function of forming a film on sand. Soda ash is the alkaline salt to counteract acidity. A pH value of between 7.4 and 7.6 has proved most satisfactory to the swimmers using these baths. Aeration is maintained by means of an air compressor. Sterilization: Chlorine gas is used a residual of 0.5 to 0.75 p. p.m. being strictly adhered to. In the summer months when heavy loads are to be expected it is kept at 0.75 p. p.m. The frequency of changing the baths water is governed by the flow through the filters which in the case of these establishments is approximately once every four hours. In the summer months when the baths are open for 12 to 14 hours daily a complete turnover of three times per day is necessary. One sample of the water at Highbury Fields open air swimming pool which is controlled by the London County Council was taken during the summer season for bacteriological examination. The London County Council was informed of the result which was satisfactory and is included in the figure given at the head of this section. 57 SECTION D HOUSING (In conjunction with Mr. W.C. Bartlett, Chief Public Health Inspector). The County of London Report giving certain detailed information which was incorporated in the 1961 Census was published in the early part of 1963, and provides valuable information relevant to the social and housing circumstances of the population in the Borough. Because of its housing significance, certain extracts are included here: Private households and dwellings, 1961 Private households Population in private households Structurally separate dwellings occupied Rooms occupied Density of occupation Persons per room Percentage of persons at more than 1Â½ per room LONDON 1,134,747 3,024,585 917,395 4,010,914 0.77 11.5 ISLINGTON 82,017 220,665 50, 827 257,370 0.87 17.7 It will be noted from the above table that the percentage of persons in Islington at an average density of more than 1& per room is a little more than 50% above the corresponding percentage for the County of London as a whole., It is also significant that of the 11 Islington Wards, in not a single Ward is the density less than the County figure. On this basis the St. Mary, Canonbury, and St. Peter Wards are the least densely occupied in Islington and the Lower Holloway and Thornhill Wards have the highest density figures, double the London average. The following table gives the household arrangements in relation to the availability or otherwise of piped cold water, piped hot water, a fixed bath and water closet: All Households Total number of households 80, 980 Households with Household Arrangements as follows:- Piped Cold Water - Households S 9,395 Per Cent 11.6 Households N 229 Per Cent. 0.3 Piped Hot Water - Households S 5,103 Per Cent. 6.3 Households N 46,517 Per Cent. 57.4  All Households Fixed bath- Households S 20, 728 Per Cent. 25.6 Households N 36,795 Per Cent. 45.4 Water Closet - Households S 43,729 Per Cent. 54.0 Households N 662 Per Cent 0.8 All four arrangements- Households E 18,954 Per Cent. 23.4 E = having exclusive use; S = sharing with another household; N = entirely without Cold Water tap refers to a tap within the building. It does not include a tap in an open yard or a public standpipe. Hot Water tap means water piped to any form of heating appliance which will allow hot water to be drawn from a tap within the building, e.g. a boiler tank with immersion heater, geyser, or sink heater. Fixed bath means a bath permanently installed with a waste pipe leading outside the building. It does not matter for this purpose whether there is water piped to it or whether the room where it is installed is used only as a bathroom or not. It will be noted from the above figures that nearly 60 per cent. of all households in the Borough are without a piped hot water supply and 45 per cent. entirely without a fixed bath in their house. Over half have to share a water closet. These indices are a measure of the urgent necessity for the modernisation of the majority of housing premises in the Borough in order to provide minimum amenity standards which today, are considered necessary for all. Clearance Areas The Minister of Housing and Local Government confirmed Orders under Part III, Housing Act, 1957, in relation to the under-mentioned Clearance Areas: Nos. 1, 2 , 3, 4, 5 , 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 , 20 , 21, 22, 23 , 24 , 25, 26 , 27, 28, 29 , 30 , 31, 32, 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37, 38 , 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 , 45, Playford Road (44 houses). 59 In addition the following areas were represented and declared to be Clearance Areas by the Council:- Elmore Street Area - Nos. 118, 120, 122, 124, 126 128 130, 132, 134, 136, Elmore Street (10 houses). Lonsdale Place Area - Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 7, 8, 9, 10 11 Lonsdale Place (9 houses). Housing Act 1961 As mentioned in my previous report the Housing Act 1961 has given local authorities new and strengthened powers to deal with houses in multiple occupation. The implementation of this Statute calls for the fullest co-operation by local authorities, owners and tenants. The Minister of Housing and Local Government issued the Housing (Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation) Regulations 1962 which provide a Code of Management which a local authority may apply by Order to any house wholely or partly let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, which is in an unsatisfactory condition in consequence of defective management. In the case of a building which comprises separate dwellings (e.g. a tenement building or a block of flats), the Regulations may be applied in circumstances mentioned in Section 21 of the Act to the building as a whole instead of individual dwellings therein. In Circular No. 16/62 the Minister gave in an accompanying memorandum general guidance on the application of the Housing Act, 1961. These powers fall into four main groups. An entirely new power to apply a Code of Management to individual houses in which proper standards of management have not been observed, Stronger powers to require the provision of additional facilities and amenities essential to decent living conditions and the provision of adequate means of escape from fire. A new power for local authorities to carry out work in default and recover the cost. A power, also new, to make a direction limiting the number of persons who may live in a house, or part of a house, which is in multiple occupation The Housing (Prescribed Forms) (Amendment) Regulations 1962 amended certain prescribed forms and added new forms for the purpose of Part II of the Housing Act, 1961. During the year a survey of multiple occupied houses was commenced and 128 inspections of individual houses and 393 inspections of flats in buildings falling within Section 21 of the Housing Act, 1961 were carried out. These inspections confirmed that the older type of property in the Borough is being purchased by owners who let single or tworoom lettings to persons of different nationalities, habits and customs. Many of these families are compelled by varying circumstances to share accommodation thus creating a considerable problem . The ideal would be to provide each family with its own facilities and amenities but due to many premises being old and badly arranged it is not a practical proposition. The Council being aware of this fact have adopted a Code of Practice which it is hoped will achieve the minimum desired facilities in unfit houses. In the case of many blocks of 60 flats built some ninety years ago the problem becomes more acute. The best way of dealing with them would be by clearance but the need for rehousing would be on such a scale that this would be an impossibility. It is apparent, however, that if a measure of rehousing could be carried out combined with conversion works where possible, the basic amenities for each occupying family could be provided. Many informal discussions between owners and the Public Health Inspectors took place during the year and with co-operation, the provision of additional amenities was secured., It is also interesting to note that many cases of penal overcrowding were abated by informal means. It is important that overcrowding is dealt with before any action be taken by the Council to provide additional services and amenities in any dwelling As many of the tenants of houses in multiple occupation are at work during the day the Inspectors are required to complete their surveys during evenings and it is evident that inspections outside the normal hours of duty will have to continue in order to implement the provisions of the Housing Act, 1961. During the year one Management Order was made in respect of a block of flats and following works carried out by the owners, it was possible to recommend a revocation of this order. Miscellaneous During the past six years some hundreds of houses have been dealt with under Part II Housing Act, 1957. The time has now been reached when it may be possible to deal with those houses which are unfit according to Section 4 standard but which are capable of repair at reasonable expense. There is of course the problem of dealing with unfit basements and parts of houses but here again owners are availing themselves of the latest building research developments to render such rooms fit for human habitation. Regulations for securing the proper ventilation and lighting of underground rooms and the protection thereof against dampness, effluvium or exhalation were made during the year. These, with certain modifications are similar to previous regulations which were rescinded. Consultations took place with the London County Council in connection with the siting of mobile homes on certain unused sites where permanent development was unlikely to take place for a period of at least two years This temporary housing accommodation will be used to augment the County Council's general housing pool. The number of houses and flats erected in the Borough during the year was Borough Council 162 London County Council 100 Private Enterprise (Inc. 24 - City of London Corporation) 144 The number of municipal flats and houses erected since the war is Borough Council 3,965 London County Council 2,960 +29 rebuilds from war damage The total number of dwellings (i.e. flats and houses separately assessed) in the Borough at the end of the year was 47 288, 61 Housing Act, 1957 During the year the following actions were taken: Section 9 (Repair of insanitary houses) Inspections - Visits - Section 16 (Individual unfit houses) Inspections, Visits and Be-visits 1,135 Houses represented 17 Undertakings accepted - Undertakings cancelled upon completion of work - Section 17 (Individual unfit houses) Closing Orders made 11 Demolition Orders made 2 Houses demolished 22 Section 18 (Parts of buildings including basement rooms) Inspection , Visits and Revisits (a) Basement Rooms 712 (b) Other parts of buildings 78 Bepresentations made (a) Basement Booms 23 (b) Other parts of buildings 11 Closing Orders (a) Basement rooms 21 (b) Other parts of buildings 8 Undertakings accepted (Basement Rooms) 2 Undertakings cancelled of part cancelled upon completion of work (basement rooms) 4 Section 24 (Individual Unfit houses) Demolition Orders revoked 1 Section 27 Closing Orders determined or part-determined upon completion of work in respect of (a) Whole houses 46 (b) Basement rooms 35 (c) Other parts of buildings 2 Section 90 (Houses let in lodgings -overcrowding) Inspections and Revisits 2 Beports to Committee - Overcrowding abated - Section 42 (Clearance Areas) Inspections 14 Be-visits 185 Housing Consolidated Amendment Regulations, 1932 (House to House Inspections) Number of inspections 69 Number of Visits & He-visits 72 Housing Subsidies Act, 1956, as Amended by Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958.

Bartlett, Chief Public Health Inspector) During the year the following Regulations were made which had the effect indicated: The Food Hygiene (General) Regulations 1962 These Regulations amend the regulations of 1960 which restrict the preparation and packing of food on domestic premises by outworkers so that Regulation 7 of the 1960 Regulations now applies to the preparation of onions. The position about the preparation of shrimps and prawns is unaltered. The Einulsifiers and Stabilisers in Food Regulations 1962 These Regulations prohibit the importation or sale of food containing emulsifiers or stabilisers not on the permitted list. They further prohibit the sale or importation of flour and other specified foods containing any emulsifiers or stabilisers. The Regulations prohibit the sale or advertising of any emulsifiers or stabilisers for use in food which is not Statutorily permitted. Milk and Dairies (Emulsifiers and Stabilisers) Regulations 1962 These prohibit the sale of any liquid milk to which any emulsifiers or stabilisers have been added. Preservatives in Food Regulations 1962 These re-enact previous legislation and the principle changes include inter alia:- (a) The list of permitted preservatives and of specified foods which contain those preservatives has been extended. (b) Specified foods may contain a mixture of permitted preservatives within certain limits. Where certain food is certified by Public Analyst as containing any preservative not permitted by the Regulations, that food may be treated for the purposes of Section 9 of the Pood and Drugs Act, 1955 as being unfit for human consumption. Food and Drugs (Legal Proceedings) Regulations 1962 Milk and Dairies (Legal proceedings) Regulations 1962. These Regulations amend previous legislation by applying specifically certain sections of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955 relating to Legal Proceedings Milk and Dairies (Preservative) Regulations 1962 These prohibit the addition of any preservative to milk and the sale of any milk to which such an addition has been made. Approval was given for three Inspectors to attend a Refresher Course in meat inspection given by the Food Commodities Department of the College for the Distributive Trades. The course was held during the evenings and consisted of 18 lecture/demonstrations. Night inspections were carried out by certain Inspectors concerned with the supervision of refreshment houses, the transit of meat, night clubs and the delivery of milk to retailers. Complaints of alleged unfitness were received in respect of the following:- Cloth in corned beef Lead in Angelica Contaminated sweets Maggots in raisins Deposit in bottle of milk Mould in loaves of bread Discolouration in pork pie Mould in chicken and veal pie Extraneous matter in sultanas Mould in steak and kidney pie Foreign body in loaves of bread Mould in steak pie Foreign matter in bottles of milk Nail in cake Foreign substance in Eccles Cake Nail in chocolate truffle Foreign substance in Pork Pie Rubber glove in tin of pineapple Foreign substance in tin of blackberries Steel screw in cake Glass in bottles of milk Unsound tin of strawberries Glass in bottle of Yoghourt Water in tin of condensed milk Glass in cheese sandwich Wire in loaf of bread Wood fragment in fruit bun. At one address in the Borough a quantity of bread pudding was found to be in a mouldy condition, seized by the Inspector and an order obtained from the Magistrate for it to be destroyed as unfit for human consumption. Details of the prosecution in respect of the above complaints and action of the Bispectors appears on Pages 67-58, In the main, the standard of hygiene in food undertakings is at a reasonably good level but there is a hardcore which remains where conditions are such that constant supervision is necessary. Inspectors endeavour to demonstrate on the premises how it is possible with the minimum of equipment and cost to secure hygienic and clean conditions. Much of the Inspectors' time is taken up in seeking to educate those engaged in the handling of food but towards the end of the year, difficulty was experienced in maintaining compliance with the Pood Hygiene Regulations due to the severe wintry weather that set in. Those responsible for retail food shops, cafes and restaurants were unable to keep their premises up to normal standard due to the fact that customers came in with dirt, ice and snow on their boots. In many cases the water supply was cut off or the service frozen and certain areas were affected by power cuts and decreased gas supplies. A number of unsatisfactory conditions were reported and legal proceedings instituted in one case under the Pood Hygiene Regulations as reported on Page 67, In one case, the registration of premises used for the manufacture of sausages was cancelled. The Inspectors' work has been increased due to the number of immigrants coming into the Borough, who open up or take over food premises. Some apply to open licensed clubs Many are not conversant with the English language and difficulty is experienced in getting over what is necessary to comply with the requirements of the legislation. 65 During the year, a new aspect of immigrant food problems was encountered. Information was received in one case which led to finding the remains of two sheep carcases which had been buried in the garden of a private house, The owner was a Moslem and the animals were slaughtered according to ritual and the edible parts distributed to friends. The remains found were taken away in one of the Department's vans and destroyed. Information was received in another instance, but in this case, the animal was found alive, again in the back garden of a private house, and the owner here agreed to the animal being slaughtered at the Metropolitan Cattle Market. This was done, and upon examination, the carcase was condemned as being unfit due to a dropsical and emaciated condition. The occasional slaughter of animals not intended for sale for human consumption does not appear to be covered by legislation, and the carcase may therefore not be examined and passed as fit for human consumption. It has been pointed out to those concerned that facilities are available at the Metropolitan Cattle Market for animals to be slaughtered in accordance with ritual conditions, and it is hoped that this kind of practice will not be repeated. Due to staff difficulties the number of samples taken during the year and routine inspections is lower than usual, but it is anticipated that the position will improve in the coming year.

Condemned food received from traders is either taken to the Council's refuse disposal depot at Ashburton Grove, awaiting conveyance, under supervision, to the refuse tip or is dyed in order to make it impossible for it to be re-sold or used for human consumption. Condemned meat is used for animal feeding or industrial purposes. 69 Sampling 1962 181 samples (13 formal and 168 informal) were sent to the Public Analyst for examination. Thirty-one of these samples, or 17.13% were subject to adverse reports as shown in the summary below. It should be noted however, that with regard to these adverse reports that a number relates to samples not taken during routine sampling but the subject of a complaint.

Details of action taken are as follows - Cattle Excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Horses Number killed (if known) 203 1,305 53 69 - 646 Number inspected 203 1,305 53 69 - 646 70 Cattle Excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Horses All diseases except Tuberculosis & Cysticerci Whole carcases condemned 9 87 3 27 - 11 Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 31 619 1 12 - 63 Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than tuberculosis and cysticerci 19.7 54.09 7.55 56.52 â 11.46 Tuberculosis only Whole carcases condemned - - - - - - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - 1 - - - â Percentage of the number inspected affected with tuberculosis - .08 - - - - Cysticercosis Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - â - â - - Carcases submitted to treatment by refrigeration â - - â - - Generalised and totally condemned - - - - - â From the above table it will be observed that incidence of tuberculosis is extremely low. This is due to the eradication of tuberculosis programme being carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Three carcases affected with Qysticercus Bovis were received from another area and treated by refrigeration under the supervision of the Inspector concerned. After being kept at a temperature below 14 Â°F. for a period of not less than 3 weeks, they were released. All diseased or unfit meat was disposed of for use as knacker's meat or in the manufacture of animal feeding preparations. Of the 646 horses slaughtered for human consumption, 514 were intended for export. Slaughter of Animals Act, 1958. Slaughtermen's Licences. During the year eleven Licences were renewed and were current at 31st December. Export Certificates - Food 15 Export Certificates were issued. The food consisted mainly of tinned and bottled meats (boneless chicken, ox tongue, ham etc.), soups, ox tongue and ham spreads. The majority of the food went to Canada (4) U.S.A. (5); other countries were British Guiana (3), Saudi Arabia (2) and Spain (1). 71 Merchandise Marks Act, 1887/1953 Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marking) Act, 1928/31 Details of the Inspections carried out by the Inspectors are as follows - Merchandise Marks Acts Inspections 23 Contraventions found - Contraventions remedied - Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marking) Acts Inspections Contraventions found - Licensed Clubs Number of Applications received 39 Number of Applications objected to 3 Number of Applications refused 3 Number of Appeals nil Number of visits to Licensed Clubs 39 Inspection of Refreshment and Coffee Stalls Evening inspections of refreshment and coffee stalls were carried out by Public Health Inspectors as found necessary. No complaints relative to such stalls were received during the year, and the conditions found to exist at the time of the Inspectors' visits were generally satisfactory. Free Washing Facilities in Public Conveniences The Council continued to provide free washing facilities in public conveniences in order to encourage cleanliness amongst food handlers and partically, street traders who have no convenient personal facilities.

A considerable number of items were considered by the Committee during the year and the following may be of general interest:- The Committee expressed its support for the Fireworks Bill, and letters were sent to local Members of Parliament, supporting the second reading When the Bill was deferred a letter was sent to Ro. S.P.A. pressing that it should be proceeded with The inadvisability of amateur electrical installation was stressed when a case was brought to the notice of the Committee where a resident had had her skirt burned while standing near an electric fire. The guard was tested by the Public Health Inspector, but it was subsequently discovered that 14Â½ amps, instead of 12Â½ amps was passing into the fire and causing the additional heat. A resume of Dr. Colin-Russ" talk to the Home Safety Committee was circulated to all Practitioners in the Borough. Practitioners were also supplied with leaflets giving advice in connection with the Broken Glass Campaign and requested to give publicity to the subj ect in their waiting rooms. The Deputy Medical Officer of Health co-operated in first aid and safety training lectures conducted by the St. John Ambulance Brigade.

Grant r V' General Regular publicity by means of leaflets and posters, changed according to season and topicality, together with the distribution of 1,000 copies per month of "Better Health" mainly through the Islington Public Libraries, and the provision of "Family Doctor" for reading, continued throughout the year. 77 SERVICES FOR ELDERLY PERSONS Section 31 of the National Assistance Act 1948 authorised local authorities to make contributions to the funds of voluntary organisations whose activities include the provision of recreation or meals for old people. The Borough Council have financially assisted the Islington Old People's Welfare Council and the Women's Voluntary Service for many years under this provision and this has allowed the establishment of meals services, both domiciliary and to clubs, the setting up of a work centre, and other various activities. In 1962, the National Assistance Act 1948 (Amendment) Act became operative and this extended the earlier provisions, allowing the local authority to make arrangements for recreation and meals for old people, either directly or through voluntary organisations as agencies. A comprehensive review of the existing services formed the subject of a report to the Public Health Committee, The review included the i meals services, recreation services, visiting and transport of elderly persons for the purposes allowed in the in the Act. It was anticipated that it should be possible during the forthcoming year, viz. 1963, to introduce certain extensions and improvements for the benefit of elderly persons in the Borough. As mentioned in previous Reports, the Borough, largely through the Public Health Department, effects liaison with voluntary organisations as well as other statutory authorities, assisting old people in one form or another. In the voluntary sphere, acknowledgements are again due to Miss D.E. Church, the Honorary Secretary, and the members of the Islington Old People's Welfare Council and to Mrs E. MacGregor, M.B.E., Centre Organiser of the Women's Voluntary Service and her colleagues Visiting of Elderly Persons The greater part of the organised and systematic visiting of elderly persons is carried out by members of the Public Health Department, who visit for the purposes of the Public Health, L C.C. (General Powers) and National Assistance Acts, The Old Persons' Register maintained in the Department now contains some 3,300 names out of an approximate total of 25,000 over 65 years of age. The Department's Visitors called on 827 new cases during the year and re -visits totalled 5,947. They made 3,838 references during the year to persons or organisations outside the Department, and in present circumstances, it is most unlikely that this kind of help could have been given in any other way in the absence of the Department" s own staff. These references covered requests for provision of meals and home help services, welfare home or hospital admission, National Assistance or grants and introductions to clubs, Work Centre, and associations dealing with blind and handicapped persons, registrations with medical practitioners, and help in contacting relatives. Gas and Electricity undertaking were notified of defective appliances and recommendations were made to the London County Council for the provision of fireguards in an additional 24 cases. 150 cases were also recommended for home nursing equipment supplied through the County Council The Borough Council's grant to the Old People's Welfare Council for the year, utilised mainly for the provision of meals, holidays, and part-time employment for the elderly, totalled Â£8,595. 78 Public Health (London) Act 1936. Section 122 Cleansing and Laundry Service Heavy demands continue to be made on the disinfecting and laundry unit at the Treatment Centre. Islington residents: No. of recipients approved 140 No. of washings carried out 2,624 No. of articles cleansed 26,090 Home for Confirmed Invalids, Highbury Terrace The weight of laundry dealt with during the year was 3 tons 3 cwts. 0 qtr.25 lbs.

During the year 779 washings, comprising 9,215 articles, were carried out on behalf of 51 recipients. Stoke Newington Borough A similar agreement was entered into, as with Holborn Borough Council. During the year 385 washings, comprising 3,249 articles, were carried out on behalf of 14 recipients. Corporation of London Washings - 49 Articles - 580 London County Council (General Powers) Act 1953. Section 43 Cleansing of Elderly Persons The service of the bathing of elderly persons must be closely associated with the laundry service mentioned above. Home bathing may be carried out by the Department's own staff in the person's home if he or she is homebound. Alternatively, bathing may be done at the Treatment Centre, Seven Sisters Road, and those who can leave their home but would have difficulties with public transport can be taken to the Centre in the Department's own specially-designed vehicle 192 persons were thus assisted by the Department's nursing and bathing staff, and this entailed 1,217 home visits and 561 baths given at the Treatment Centre. All this work is carried out under the Supervision of the Nurse-in Charge at the Centre. During the year, the Public Health Committee considered and approved tenders for carrying out the modernisation of the baths at the Treatment Centre Agreed plans include the provision of two slipper type baths, but with special fitments and two shower compartments fitted with seats when complete this should greatly facilitate the bathing of elderly persons and the new arrangements will also ease the work of the staff which on occasions, can be physically quite heavy when helping heavily-built elderly persons who may be unable to exert very much personal physical effort. The Committee approved a modernisation scheme estimate of Â£4,500. 79 National Assistance Acts, 1948 and 1951 It was necessary to invoke the procedure for the removal to suitable premises without delay in respect of two elderly persons, in accordance with the provisions of the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951. An order under subsection (3) of section forty-seven of the National Assistance Act,1948, for the remawal of any such person as is mentioned in subsection (1) of that section may be made without the notice required by sub-section (7) of that section if it is certified by the Medical Officer of Health and another registered medical practitioner that in their opinion it is necessary in the interests of that person to remove him without delay. Details of the statutory action taken are given in the following statement which has been compiled in the form required by the Ministry of Health. Aged and Infirin - Action taken under Statutory Powers Name and Age Reason for Council's Action Period Named in Order Type of accommodation to which removed Ultimate Result (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Case No. 1 Mr.H. (Sen.) 78 years This man was known to the Public Health Department since March, 1955, following thre the death of his wife. He lived week with his son, who was under the care of the London County Council Health Department, Mental Health Section. Both father and son were visited regularly by officers from both authorities. In March, 1962 the father injured his hand, and his general condition deteriorated rapidly. His Doctor recommended Hospital, but he refused. He was visited by the Deputy Medical Officer of Health, who agreed that Hospital admission was necessary. The Mental Welfare Officer was informed, and the son was admitted to a suitable Hospital. An application was made on the 23rd March, 1962 to a Justice of the Peace for an Order for the father's removal to Hospital. He was admitted the same day. Not exceeding three weeks Geriatric Hospital Died in Hospital two months after admission Case No. 2 Miss A.. 76 years She was a retired nurse, living alone. She suffered from a grave chronic disease, and had been in Hospital several times. Visit were made regularly by officers of the Public Health Department since October, 1956. When she was at home and able to get about she managed reasonably well, with the domiciliary services provided, both by the Islington Borough Council and the London County Council. In July, 1962 she was confined to bed and required more medical attention than could be provided at home. Her Doctor advised Hospital admission, but she refused to leave home. Not exceeding three weeks Geriatric Hospital Died in Hospital six months after admission 80 Miss A... cont. The Deputy Medical Officer of Health visited and confirmed the need for Hospital admission. An application was made to a Justice of the Peace on the morning of the 20th July for an Order for her removal to Hospital, and she was admitted later in the day. Fortunately, in relatively very few cases is it necessary to apply for a Court Order for removal of elderly people under the National Assistance Acts. The following are just a few examples of the ways in which the Department'1 s health officers are able to take action or ameliorate conditions on a basis of voluntary co-operation. Mr. C. (86 years) He was a bachelor living on his own in one room on the second floor, and was brought to the attention of the Department in November, 1960, because of his unpleasant habits. He was a recluse, and resented interference. He finally agreed to accept some welfare services such as home-help, meals-on-wheels and home bathing. Later on he agreed to go into a Welfare Home, but only remained there for a short time. After returning home, as the premises in which he lived had been made the subject of a Closing Order - he was re-housed by the Borough Council in a freshly decorated ground-floor flat in a converted house. He did not, however, settle in his new surroundings and left home one night and was missing for several days. He was eventually traced to a General Hospital, and later was discharged to his home. He soon became very mentally confused and was removed to a Mental Hospital in March, 1962, where he died the following month. Mr. R. (67 years) This bachelor, who lived in one room on the second floor, was referred to the Department in October, 1962 by his Medical Practitioner because he had been off work for six weeks through ill-health. Following visits by the Health Officer for Elderly Persons and the Public Health Inspector, his room was found to be in a very dirty condition, cluttered up with unnecessary articles such as empty bottles, newspapers, etc. In consultation with the Medical Practitioner, he was admitted to Hospital, and whilst he was there his consent was obtained for thoroughly cleansing and disinfesting his room. Hie initial cleansing and disinfesting was undertaken by members of the Public Health Department, and the landlord had his room redecorated. He was discharged from Hospital towards the end of 1962, and early in 1963 he was able to return to his work. Since that time his room has been kept in a fairly clean and tidy condition. Mrs. T. (80 years) She was a widow living alone in two rooms on the first floor whose family had moved away from the district. She was reported to the Department in June, 1962 because of her dirty appearance and her wanderings about the neighbourhood. When the Health Officer for Elderly Persons visited her, she found that the room was infested with bugs and cluttered up with unnecessary furniture and clothing In addition, she discovered that there was a sum of Â£20 owing for the rent. Disinfestation and cleansing were undertaken by members of the Public Health Department, and she was also given the facilities of a home-help, the Borough Council's laundry service and home-bathing Arrangements were made to ensure that her arrears of rent were paid She was given part-time work at the Old People's Work Centre, and she received a daily meal when she was there. She became confused, and was referred to the Mental Welfare Department of the London County Council. Both the Health Officer and the Mental Welfare Officer are continuing to keep a close supervision of her, but up to the moment it has been possible to maintain her in her own home with the services arranged. 81 Miss W. (68 years) This spinster, who had no known relatives, lived in one room and was a dressmaker who had recently stopped work. In 1961 she was referred to the Department by her Medical Practitioner because of the neglected conditions in her home. When the Health Officer visited, she found the room so congested with mirrors and furnishings from her dressmaking business that it was almost impossible to get into it. The home-help and mealson-wheels services were provided for her. Later she was admitted to Hospital for a short time, and on discharge the domiciliary services were re-introduced She became very confused and muddled about her affairs, but she would not go for any psychiatric advice. Finally she agreed to go into a Welfare Home, provided it was the one of her choice and was situated in the country. A vacancy was obtained in Virginia Water, Surrey, and towards the end of 1962 she went to live there; up to the present she has remained quite happy in her new surroundings National Assistance Act, 1948. Section 31 "Meals-on-Wheels " and Lunch Clubs This Section of the Act permits Local Authorities to make contributions to the funds of any voluntary organisation whose activities include the provision of recreation or meals for old people. Grants were approved for "Meals-on-Wheels" services operated b the Women's Voluntary Service and the Islington Old People's Welfare Council. Meals supplied during the year were as follows:Meals-on-Wheels Women's Voluntary Service 7,016 ) 18,610 meals cooked Islington Old People's Welfare Council 6,032 by NALGO, Town Hall Canteen Lunch Clubs Gifford Hall Mission Welcome Club 3,986 ) Caxton House Settlement 1,576 ) A lunch club at St. Giles Christian Mission Bride Street, N.7,; also produced 2,271 meals with the help of their own voluntary workers and Council grant-aid. Another lunch club, situated in the Borough of Finsbury, at Claremont Central Mission, White Lion Street, also caters for Islington residents and receives a Â£50 grant from this Council. The provision of between 70 and 80 meals each day of the service is, of course, very useful and, since much of the work involved in the transport of meals is of a voluntary nature, the "Meals-on Wheels" service does represent a very considerable voluntary effort. Nevertheless, the present service is limited because it is not possible, in general, to provide each elderly person recommended for a meal a delivery on more than two days a week. From the nature of the recommendations, there is no doubt the great majority, if not all would benefit by the service being at least doubled to 4 meals, or possibly more, per week This has not hitherto been possible, but it is certainly to be hoped that an increase can be envisaged in the not too distant future. Holidays for Elderly Persons Assisted holidays were again much in demand, and 537 elderly people were able to enjoy a holiday through the Borough Council's grant-aided scheme, which is administered by the Old People's Welfare Council. A sum of Â£2,430 was earmarked to meet costs which pensioners could not be expected to pay. Most holidaymakers, however, were able to pay some of their expenses and Miss Church, Honorary Secretary of the Welfare Council, arranged to collect small weekly sums to suit the convenience of the savers. 82 Parcels for Elderly Persons The Borough Council authorised the expenditure of Â£100 on Christinas gift parcels, and it was possible to make a distribution to about a hundred elderly folk. The health officers recommended suitable recipients and delivery was arranged by the Islington Old People's Welfare Council. Islington Work Centre for the Elderly This is another social venture which has now become firmly established in Islington. Numbers attending the sessions have increased and the workroom is usually full to capacity, providing part-time employment for between 85 and 90 persons, each working five half-day sessions per week. The Centre is sited at the Elizabeth Whitelaw Reid Club, Cloudesley Street, N.1., and Miss K.D. Lane Centre Organiser, is responsible for the day-to-day business, while the Centre is run under the direction of a SubCommittee of the Old People's Welfare Council. Generally speaking, sufficient out-work was provided by application to local firms, and the old people were able to reach a high standard of efficiency in carrying out the various tasks. As well as giving them an added interest, a small monetary reward and an opportunity of meeting other elderly folk, the Work Centre is fulfilling a valuable purpose in helping to maintain in these retired people a sense of usefulness in the community. Chiropody The financial responsibility for this service, as reported last year, has now passed to the London County Council, but the local administration and appointments system are dealt with by the Islington Old People's Welfare Council, who run nine weekly sessions and make appointments for approximately 72 persons each week. In additior 550 infirm persons received treatment in their own homes. 83 PUBLIC MORTUARY By agreement with the St. Pancras Borough Council the use of the Council's Mortuary was discontinued as and from 31st March, 1949, all bodies being received at the St. Pancras Mortuary, Cramley Street, N.W.1., after that date. ISLINGTON CREMATORIUM The Medical Referee or the Deputy Medical Referee certified a total of 633 applications for cremation at the Council's Crematorium, East Pinchley. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE SERVICES The London Cbunty Council, as the Local Health Authority, is responsible for the Maternity and Child Welfare Services, the Home Help Service and a foot clinic service in the Borough, which, together with the Boroughs of Pinsbury and Holborn, constitute Division 3.
