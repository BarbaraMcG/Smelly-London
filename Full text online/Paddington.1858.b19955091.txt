BURDON SANDERSON, M.D., L.R.C.P., Medical Officer of Health, Lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence in the Medical School of St. Mary's Hospital, Physician to the Western General Dispensary. B REPORT TO THE VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you my Annual Statement for the year terminating Lady-Day, 1859. It includes a tabular Synopsis of the proceedings of the Sanitary Committee under the Local Management Act and the Act for the Removal of Nuisances; and a Summary of other measures in operation during the year for the promotion of the health of the Parish. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. BURDON SANDERSON. 9, Gloucester Place ; July, 1859. 12 A. PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE ACT FOR THE BETTER LOCAL MANAGEMENT OF THE METROPOLIS. During the year terminating March 25th, 1859, 440 Notices of Orders were issued The required improvements have in every instance been carried out by the parties liable, with two exceptions. In one of these the Vestry has found it necessary to execute works of Drainage in default, in compliance with the provisions of the 73rd Section of the Act, and the expenses have since been recovered from the owner. In the other, compulsory proceedings are now in progress. In respect of fourteen of the thirty - eight Orders for Drainage referred to in my last Report as having been suspended for various reasons, the works have been since executed.* The following is an alphabetical list of the principal Streets and Places in which Sanitary works have been completed in execution of Orders under the Local Management Act issued during the three years ending December 31st, 1859. * The following is the method of proceeding now adopted by the Committee : A Notice, of a purely preliminary character, is first placed in the hands of the owner or occupier, in which he is called upon to execute the works required within a given time. Should he not think it expedient to comply, the Committee, before proceeding to any compulsory measure, requests his attendance at their next meeting. In the event of his failing to attend, or to give satisfactory reasons for non-compliance, a second Notice, of a formal and peremptory nature, is served, which is the initiative of legal proceedings. 13 TABLE I. works completed under orders issued during 1856, 1857 and 1858.

In answer to the communication of the Sanitary Committee of the 18th of March, 1858, (see former Report,) expressive of the opinion that no other means excepting that of emptying the Canal basin during the winter months and removing the mud by hand labour would be effectual for the improvement of its condition, a letter was received from the Secretary intimating that it was the intention of the Company to continue for some time the process of hand-dredging, to empty the basin as usual at Whitsuntide, and to clear away whatever quantity of mud should be left, by loading it into boats. To this the Committee replied (March 22nd), that at the season proposed the temperature is generally such as to render the removal of the putrefying mud by spade inadmissible. Notwithstanding this protest, the Canal basin was emptied on the 24th of May. The water was allowed to re-enter on the 1st of June. The quantity of mud which occupied the channel was found to be greater by far than was anticipated either by the officers of the Vestry, or, apparently, by those of the Company. The preparations made for its removal were so inadequate for the purpose, that although the operation of cleansing the channel by spade was continued during eight days, the excavation had not at the end of that period extended to so much as one hall of the whole area 2'2 of the basin. During the last three days when the weather was unusually hot, the emanations were most overpowering, and afforded convincing evidence of the inexpediency and probable danger of exposing the channel to the summer sun. On chemical examination, it was found that the mud contained a large quantity of sulphuretted hydrogen, fixed by alkaline or earthy matters. With these facts before them, the Committee thought it necessary again to request an interview with the Directors, who accordingly appointed Friday, July the 9th, for the purpose. The members of Parliament for the Borough kindly gave their attendance on the occasion. On the part of the Committee, their Chairman insisted on the necessity of the improvements already indicated, and further proposed that the waste weir should be removed from its present position to the eastern end of the Basin, in order to create a current throughout its whole length. The Directors promised that the Basin should be emptied, and the channel excavated by spade labour, during the winter. On the 6th of December the Committee again communicated with the Directors, reminding them of their engagements; a letter was received in answer, in which the Secretary to the Company stated that owing to the unusual deficiency of rain, the reservoir from which the Canal is principally supplied, was nearly empty, and that " it would therefore be impossible to run off any portion of 23 the water from the Paddington Basin until such supplies could be obtained as would restore the quantity so run off." The letter concluded with the assurance that this circumstance alone prevented the immediate cleansing of the Basin.* Under these circumstances it became a question whether or not the Directors should be called upon to purchase from the water companies the supply requisite for the fulfilment of their engagements. In consideration of the heavy expense which it appeared that this would involve, and in the hope that before the end of the winter the natural sources of supply might be available, the Committee decided not to press the matter further at that time. Unfortunately these anticipations have not been realized ; the quantity of water in the Canal having been on no occasion since the beginning of the year more than sufficient to meet the ordinary requirements of the traffic. II. The Serpentine. During the past winter the Sewer in the Uxbridge Road, referred to in my last Report, was constructed. One of the results of this improvement has been that the Serpentine is now almost completely free from contamination by sewage. * The year 1858 was remarkable for the small quantity of rain which fell. The deficiency was greatest during the last three months, the rain-fall of which was 3.1 inches, instead of 7.6 inches, the average quantity during the corresponding quarters ot the previous 40 years. 24 Although there is still a communication between the Ranelagh Sewer and the lake, its contents only enter after unusual falls of rain, and so diluted by surface water as to be almost innocuous. The subject of the cleansing of the Serpentine was several times under the consideration of the Committee, but was finally postponed in consideration of a statement made on the 8th of March in the House of Commons by the late first Commissioner of Works, that he intended to take a vote for the purpose during the present session. III. Cow Sheds. This subject has again received the attention of the Committee. During last Summer complaints were made of the most pressing nature by householders residing in all those parts of the Parish in which Cow Sheds exist. In these complaints it was most reasonably represented that the practice of keeping Cows in the immediate neighbourhood of inhabited houses ought not to be allowed ; that it is not only productive of great annoyance, but really prejudicial to health—directly so on account of the emanations arising from accumulated refuse, indirectly by introducing into the market a vitiated product instead of healthy milk. Unfortunately there is, in the present state of the law, no remedy for this evil. Pigs are prohibited absolutely and unconditionally; slaughterhouses are placed under strict regulations; but Cow Houses, which are quite as objectionable as 25 pig-styes, and much more so than slaughter-houses, are altogether beyond our control. Most of the Cow Houses complained of are well and carefully kept. The manure is removed regularly at intervals of twenty-four hours, the drainage is good, and as regards the construction of the buildings there is little to object to, even with a view to the health of the animals. The fault lies not in these particulars, but in the situation of the Cow Sheds, which are often surrounded on all sides by rows of houses higher than themselves. In the spaces thus enclosed the provision of nature for diffusing and thus neutralizing offensive emanations is frustrated; the air becomes stagnant, and, consequently, in the summer, when ventilation is felt to be more than ever a necessity, the open windows only serve to introduce the fcetor of decomposing excrements, a sure tell-tale of those more subtle but more dangerous exhalations from the lungs and skin which become mixed with the atmosphere wherever a number of animals are crowded together. The question is felt to be one of time only. The nuisances arising from slaughter houses have been during the last three years controlled by a licensing system, which has worked so well that it might no doubt be extended with advantage to Cow Sheds. The good done would be the more felt, as the evils are more intolerable. 26 IV. Vaccination. On the 6th of January, 1859, I reported to the Committee the occurrence of an outbreak of Small Pox in Salem Gardens and the neighbourhood. It having appeared from this Report that a number of the children resident in the streets in question were unprotected by Vaccination, the Committee resolved to invite the co-operation of the Board of Guardians in the matter, and to draw their attention to the powers conferred upon them for the enforcement of Vaccination by the 8th Section of the Public Health Act, 1858. That • body accordingly passed a resolution authorizing the Inspector of Nuisances to make complaint before the Police Court against all persons neglecting Vaccination. In pursuance of this resolution, that Officer was instructed by the Committee to make enquiries respecting the Vaccination of the children in every house he inspected ; and in all cases of neglect, to place in the hands of the parents the following Notice. Should this not be complied with, the refusal was in every instance to be reported to the Board of Guardians. PARISH OF PADDINGTON. To Vaccination. I have to inform you, that by neglecting the Vaccination you have rendered yourself liable to a Penalty of Twenty Shillings. I therefore require you forthwith to take to Public Vaccinator, for the purpose ot Vaccination; in failure of which, it will be my duty to bring your neglect under the notice of the proper Authorities. thomas rowell, Dated the day of 18— Sanitary Inspector. 27 The Inspector reported on the 23rd of March that he had made the necessary enquiries in 280 houses, viz., in Salem Gardens, Brindley Street, Alfred Road, Dudley Street, Church Place, North Wharf Road, White Lion Passage. In these streets he had met with eighty-three unvaccinated children: as regards sixty-seven of these, Vaccination has been since performed; in seven other cases the operation has heen deferred on reasonable grounds. The parents of the nine remaining children have wilfully refused to fulfil their duty ; and two of these have since taken small-pox and died. V. Surface Wells. On the 3rd of June, 1850, I reported on the condition of the spring-water derived from certain public pumps in this Parish, used for drinking purposes. A series of analyses were made, from which it appeared that the water of two of these pumps was decidedly impure and unfit for use, containing not only putrescible organic matter, but abundance of those mineral salts which are known to result from the decomposition of animal excrements. Although the absolute quantity of these impurities was small, there can be no doubt that the constant employment of water so contaminated, is certain to be productive of serious injury to health. It has been satisfactorily shown that in localities in which the ordinary water supply is of this character, diarrhoea is always prevalent. In 28 the Metropolis, during the last epidemic of Cholera, when such water was supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company, the mortality among the tenants of that Company was greater than that of their neighbours, who drank good water, in the proportion of 130 to 37. VI. Mewses. In order to promote the cleanliness and better keeping of the various Mewses of the Parish, a Notice was on the 6th of July, 1858, ordered by the Vestry to be affixed in a prominent position in each, requiring the frequent and regular removal of manure, and enforcing the effectual drainage and proper construction of stable premises. VII. Slaughter Houses. All the Slaughter Houses, in respect of which notice was given of an intention to apply for a licence, were inspected. Three of these had not been previously licensed, and were therefore fully reported upon. As regards two of them notice had been given to the Vestry in a former year, but the applications had been successfully opposed. This opposition was renewed, and the licences again refused by the magistrates. REPORT OF THE WORKS EXECUTED IN THE SEWERS DEPARTMENT. By WILLIAM MERRY, SURVEYOR. e REPORT Vestry Hall, Paddington; July 13 th, 1859. Gentlemen, In compliance with the requirements of the 196th Section of the "Metropolis Local Management Act," I have the honor to submit my Third Annual Report of the Works executed in the Sewers Department, from the*25th March, 1858, to the 25th March, 1859, inclusive. During the period embraced in this Report, 108 Notices for the erection of 447 Houses, and 46 Stables, have been received, in accordance with the requirements of the 76th Section of the "Metropolis Local Management Act," and fortyone applications have been made, and granted, for the re-construction of Drains to forty-seven old Houses and Premises. These were rendered necessary in consequence of Notices issued by 32 the Sanitary and Public Health Committee, or were executed at the suggestion of the Owners of the respective Buildings. In every case where Cesspools and common Privies previously existed, they have been destroyed and Water Closets substituted. The following Sewers have been constructed in the places undermentioned, at the expense of the Owners of Property:— ft. ft. in. ft. in. Richmond Mews 240 run 1. 6 by 1 6 half brick Sewer. Lanark Villas 50 „ 3. 0 by 2 0 ditto ditto. Hall Park 2005 „ 3. 9 by 2 . 6 whole brick Sewer. Ditto ditto 475„ 3. 0 by 2 0 half brick Sewer.

Seven Sewers, and one Side Entrance, have also been constructed in the following localities, at the expense of the Vestry :— 33  ft. ft. in. ft. in. Conduit-St. West . 170 run 4 0 by 4 0 whole brick Sewer. West SideCleveland Square & Gardens 520 „ 3 0 by 2 0 half brick Sewer, in lieu of defective pipes.

Harrow Road, dington Green 230 „ 3 0 by 2 0 half brick Sewer. In the Great Western Road, one Side-Entrance to Sewer has been made; and seventy-nine Gully Drains have been constructed in different parts of the Parish, for the purpose of carrying off the surface water. Total length of Sewer constructed, 7752 feet run, at a cost of £ 3899. Total length of DrainPipe laid down, 30,961 feet run—the value I estimate at £2322. About twelve miles of Brick Sewer, in which the deposit varied from two to nine inches in depth, have been thoroughly cleansed; the hard 34 deposit, which could not be removed by flushing, was raised to the surface and carried away in carts. Six-hundred and twenty-seven Gully Drains have also been cleansed. Jobbing Works, comprising 142 separate and Distinct works, such as the repair of Sewers and Gullies, together with other works connected therewith, have been executed by the Contractor to the Vestry, to the value of £ 1579. This amount includes the sum of £426 : 15 : 7 received from Owners of Property for laying Drain-Pipes under public thoroughfares. In addition to the foregoing details, I beg to state that 174 complaints on subjects connected with the Sewers Department, have been received. They had reference to stoppages in Sewers, Gullies, Drains, &c. It has been my uniform practice to give immediate attention to such matters; and I have succeeded, either in removing the cause of complaint, or have been enabled to suggest a 35 remedy for the evils brought under my consideration. I believe that all the information which is in my power to furnish, has now been condensed into this Report, which I venture most respectfully to submit to your indulgent attention. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM MERRY, SURVEYOR. To The Vestry of the Parish of P adding ton. 1859.
