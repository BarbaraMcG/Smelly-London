KEN93 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH (EXTRACT FROM THE VESTRY REPORT FOR MARCH, 1866 - MARCH, 1867 ) " » i . . REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. TO THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF KENSINGTON. June, 1867. Gentlemen, Since the date of my last Report, on account of the great amount of work entailed upon your Sanitary Department, you have thought it wise in lieu of one Sanitary Inspector and one Inspector of Obstructions,' Dust Complaints, &c., to sub-divide the Parish into three districts, viz.; North, Central, and South, with one Sanitary Inspector for each district, for all purposes, and I trust by reference to the table of the amount of work done that you will be perfectly satisfied that the change has worked most satisfactory. In presenting this brief record of works done, permit me to call your attention to the fact that, in addition to the ordinary duties of inspecting Nuisances, and periodically visiting the abodes of the poor, it has now become necessary to periodically examine all the Slaughterhouses, Cow-sheds, and Bakers' premises in which bread is baked. With regard to that part of "the Sanitary Act, 1866," relating to the regulation of houses let, or occupied in lodgings, your Vestry has not at present thought fit to adopt it. I may add here that the Gas supplied to your Parish has been occasionally examined during the past year, and found of average quality, i. e., above the standard required by the Act of Parliament. The total mortality which has taken place during this term, viz., from January to December, 1866, has been 1966, being an increase of 233 over the previous year, and of 117 over 1864. I consider this satisfactory, as our population increases with such immense rapidity. The deaths are distributed thus:— Males. Females. Total. Brompton Ward 265 250 515 Kensington & Notting Hill 712 739 1451 Total 977 989 1966 The number of deaths which have occurred under 6 years of age was 799, or 40.6 per cent, of the total number of deaths. Of this number of deaths 114 occurred in the Hospital for Consumption, nearly all not Inhabitants of the Parish. 29 The number of births has again exceeded that of the mortality by the large amount of 1114, the total number being In Brompton 680 Kensington 2500 Total 3080 From diseases of a Zymotic or Infectious character there died— In Brompton, 1866. Small Pox. Measles. Scarlatina. Whooping Cough. Diarrhoea. Fever. Cholera. T6tal 1st Quarter ... 4 1 ... 1 ... ... 6 2nd Quarter ... ... 3 9 3 2 ... 17 3rd Quarter ... 2 ... 2 8 ... 2 14 4th Quarter 1 ... 1 ... 2 ... ... 4 Total 1 6 5 11 14 2 2 46 In Kensington 1st Quarter 2 12 6 2 6 13 ... 41 2nd Quarter 3 8 3 9 5 7 1 36 3rd Quarter 1 8 6 2 74 9 3 103 4th Quarter 3 6 8 4 13 2 2 38 Total 9 34 23 17 98 31 6 218 Grand Total for the whole Parish. 10 40 28 28 112 33 8 259 Total for year, 1865. 18 52 31 37 104 77 ... 319 This return must most assuredly point out the Value of increased Sanitary precautions, for although with Cholera and Diarrhoea amongst us, the mortality from all Zymotic diseases is absolutely less by 60 than in the preceding 12 months, without taking at all into account the increase of population. 30 CHOLERA. On account of a serious outbreak of Cholera in various parts of England and in the Metropolis, your Vestry immediately appointed a Committee of Gentlemen to sit as a Board, with full powers to act on any emergency, and as often as they thought fit. The Committee accordingly held their first meeting on August 3rd, when it was ordered that all Sewers, gully grates, drains, and the various courts, should be thoroughly cleansed and flushed, and that any quantity of disinfectants required should be forthwith obtained. On the next day the Medical Parochial Officers were appointed "Medical Visitors," under the orders issued by the Lords of Her Majesty's Privy Council. Certain Dispensaries were also provided, and arrangements were made by which any of the officers were bound to attend to the poor by night or day who were suffering from Cholera or Diarrhoea. Hand-bills were immediately circulated throughout the Parish, warning the public of the danger of delay, and recommending all necessary precautions with regard to offensive smells, accumulations of manure, &c. Stand pipes for procuring wholesome water, were also substituted for the existing pumps. One extra temporary Inspector of Nuisances was also appointed; this of course is an addition to your three Sanitary Inspectors and Inspectors of Nuisances, Mr. Lovett, Mr. Wood and Mr. Langman.' Prom all these precautions taken, from the prompt manner in which your orders were carried out, and by the energetic supervision and control, as well as personal assiduity exercised by your Sanitary Committee, no deaths from Cholera occurred during the first month, viz., to September 3rd, 9 deaths took place from Diarrhoea, and 1277 cases recovered. During the following month, viz., to October 1st, 728 cases of Diarrhoea and Cholera came under treatment, 6 died, 531 recovered, and 233 remained under treatment. On October 15th, on account of the satisfactory sanitary condition of the Parish generally, as certified by all your Medical Officers, the services of the Medical Visitors were dispensed with, the statistical returns shewing for the past fortnight ending October 15th, only 2 deaths from Diarrhoea, &c., and 262 cases of a very mild nature, under treatment; at the same time the Committee expressed their thanks to the various Officers, and their perfect satisfaction of the way in which their several duties had been performed.
