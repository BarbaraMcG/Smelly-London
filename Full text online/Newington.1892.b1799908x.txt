(Signed) CHAS. COUSINS. JOHN WILT. ED WD. CRANMER Dated 16th August, 1894. 142 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. I have the honour to submit the health statistics for the year 1892. The number of deaths registered in the parish of St. Mary, Newington, during the year of 52 weeks, was 2,184, and the number of births, 4,094. The population of the parish was estimated in the middleof the year to be 116,649. The registered deaths were 70, and the registered births 9S below those registered last year. Of the 2,184 deaths, 102 died in the Newington Infirmary Workhouse, Westmoreland Road, in this parish. They comprised 62 belonging to Newington, and 40 to other parishes of the St. Saviour's Union. 704 persons belonging to Newington died outside the parish, in the Asylums Board's Hospitals, the General Hospitals, St. Saviour's Infirmary, Champion Hill, and various other institutions. When these have been properly apportioned, the actual or "corrected" number of persons who died belonging to the sanitary area will be found to be 2,848. The death rate, when calculated on this corrected number, is 24.4 per 1,000; the birth rate, which was 36.2 per 1,000 last year, has declined this year to 35.0 per 1,000. The following are the ages at death.—660 persons died under the 143 age of 1 year, 451 from 1 to 5 years, 596 from 5 to 60 years, 202 from 60 to 70 years, 194 from 70 to 80 years, 75 from 80 to 90 years, and 6 from 90 years and upwards. Causes of Death.—No death has arisen from Small Pox in the year. There has been an increase in the number of fatal cases of Measles, Scarlet Fever, Typhus Fever, and Diarrhoea, and a diminution in those of Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, and Enteric Fever, when compared with the cases of last year. 1.

The total number of cases notified was 958 this year, and 335 last year. All the houses in which the cases have occurred have been examined, and the sanitary defects found to exist have been remedied.

The fatal cases of this disease have slightly decreased in the year, the number being 38 this year as against 44 last year. The number of notifications was 148 this year, and 124 last year. All the houses were inspected and the drainage examined. Deaths from Diphtheria during the last 10 years— 1883 19 1888 18 1884 27 1889 55 1885 18 1890 32 1886 13 1891 44 1887 27 1892 38 The annual rate per 1,000 living was .32. WHOOPING COUGH. This disease still continues to be responsible for a large number of deaths. 93 occurred during the year, as against 115 last year. Deaths from Whooping Cough during the last 10 years— 1883 25 1888 74 1884 113 1889 72 1885 54 1890 87 1886 68 1891 115 1887 138 1892 93 The annual rate per 1,000 living was .79. K 146 MEASLES.

One case of this disease was reported to me as causing the death of a male aged 31 years. I carefully inquired into the matter; no rash appears to have been present on the body, and as Double Pneumonia existed, with the fact that another medical man saw the patient and pronounced it to be not a case of "Typhus," I am disposed to question the correctness of the diagnosis. The tenement in which the man resided was a "model dwelling," perfect in its sanitary arrangements, and with plenty of air space. Disinfection was carried out, and all precautions taken. The annual rate per 1,000 living was 0.00. 147 DEATHS FROM THE PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. With the Annual Rate per 1,000 persons living. Population at 1891 Census, 115,663.

Public Health and Sanitary Department, Newington vestry, August 31st, 1892. Gentlemen, I have to report, what is well known to you all, that during the last fortnight Cholera has broken out amongst emigrants arriving at Gravesend and various other ports in England from Hamburg, in which city the complaint is reported as being widely spread. For months past we have all been watching the westward course of the disease, hoping to escape it. Although the complaint is not actually in our parish, it is sufficiently near to cause the Committee to take all steps possible, in the event of its introduction, to stay its progress. As far as the sanitary condition of the parish is concerned, a vast amount of sanitary work has been done in the past few years, and I believe we were never in a better position to withstand an invasion. Your Chairman has had many interviews with me, and with his consent I have drawn up and had printed a circular setting forth in a simple manner some of the elementary directions householders should observe. The circular which I submit is in process of being distributed, and it is intended to leave a copy at every house in the parish. I have directed the Sanitary Inspectors to visit frequently those portions of the parish where animal or vegetable refuse is likely to be deposited. To visit fruit and vegetable shops, markets like East Street and Westmoreland Road, and any place where unsound and unwholesome fruit, &c., is likely to be sold. Similar directions have been given with regard to meat and fish shops. I have also written to Mr. Leach, Acting Surveyor, with regard to the cleansing and purifying of gullies, and to the daily sweeping and cleansing of such streets as Hard Street, Townley Street, Caroline Place, and others. The Dust Inspector has also received instructions to exercise the greatest care in having the dustbins emptied. The following preliminary measures I would advise the Committee to adopt:— 1.—To place under my control a gang of your workmen (say 12 in number) to carry out during the next fortnight a house-to-house inspection. 2.—To invite medical men in our parish to notify all cases of Diarrhoea in persons above 12 years of age at the usual charge of 2/6 each case. 3.-To allow disinfectants to be ordered and distributed under my directions. 149 I have recently given instructions to Messrs. Goddard & Massey to have the disinfecting apparatus repaired, and it is now in good order. In the event of Cholera being prevalent in this parish, the various circulars which have been received from the Local Government Board and the Asylums Board show very clearly that after the small number of beds available at the various hospitals has been filled, the local sanitary bodies will have to treat the cases in their own houses. To provide a hospital in our parish for the treatment of cases is entirely out of the question ; as I have said, when the Asylums Board has exhausted its resources the local bodies will then have to provide for the treatment of all cases. In the event of an epidemic, a staff of medical men, nurses, &c., will have to be provided. I would advise the Committee to agree upon some scheme whereby the necessary staff may be forthcoming in case of need. Any scheme should divide the parish into sections, probably the ward divisions might be convenient. Medical men might bo provisionally arranged with, and all other matters considered. Should necessity arise I shall be glad to give all my time to the service of the Committee. I am, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) GEORGE MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. The report was received by the Committee and duly considered. The recommendations contained therein, with the exception of the one referring to the notification of Diarrhoea, were approved. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT. Swan Place and Ann's Place.—On September 29th, in a report to the Vestry, I represented that "Nos. 1, 2 and 3, Ann's Place, Newington Butts, were so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, and that my opinion had been formed upon the following grounds :— 1. They were structurally very dilapidated. 2. The water fittings and sanitary appliances were very defective. 3. There was an absence of proper light and ventilation. 150 Also that Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, Swan Place, were so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, and that my opinion had been formed upon the following grounds:— 1. The houses had no back yards. 2. The rooms were dark and without proper means of light. 3. The walls were damp. 4. There was no through ventilation. 5. There were only two waterclosets for the five houses." The Vestry authorised proceedings to be taken for the closing of these two groups of houses. On December 12th, the Chief Inspector and I attended at the Southwark Police Court before Mr. Fenwick to support the summons for the closing of the houses in Swan Place. After taking my evidence, the magistrate adjourned the case for a week, to allow the defendant to obtain the assistance of counsel. The case was further adjourned on December 20th, and again on December 27th. On January 3rd, 1893, a closing order was obtained, and the houses have since been emptied of their occupants and closed. With regard to the houses in Ann's Place, no owner could be found, and as the houses were unoccupied a summons was not taken out. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. On February 24th I reported to the Vestry that "I had inspected on the 22nd of that month the following houses, which I would recommend to be placed under the regulations for houses let in lodgings, viz.: — Newington Butts.—No. 110. Steedman Street.—Nos. 14, 16, 16a and 18. St. Gabriel Street.—Nos. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, and 39. Clock Passage.—Nos. 5, 7, 14, 16, and 18." The report was referred to the Public Health and Sanitary Committee. 151 All particulars were given by the Medical Officer in a further report submitted to the Committee, and the requisite notices were served on the owners. The matter was duly considered, but no action, however, was taken thereon. I estimate the number of houses let in lodgings in Newington at 10,000, or nearly 70 per cent. of the gross total. PREVENTION OF EPIDEMIC DISEASES, Under section 68 of the Public Health (London) Act. On December 8th a summons was heard before Mr. Biron at the Lambeth Police Court against Mr. M-, for exposing his child in a public place while suffering from Scarlet Fever. After hearing the evidence, the magistrate said "he had no doubt but that the doctor in attendance told Mrs. M-, that the case was one of Scarlet Fever. He was, however, not quite satisfied that Mrs. M-, had made her husband sufficiently acquainted with the fact, therefore he dismissed the summons." At the same time he stated that "he thought it was a very proper case to be brought before him." On December 12th an application for a warrant was made at the Lambeth Police Court to enter No. 64, Aldbridge Street, where a case of Scarlet Fever had occurred, and where the occupier refused to allow the Medical Officer to enter the house. Mr. Hopkins, the magistrate, granted the warrant, and the necessary entry was made. Sanitary Work. —The period comprised in this report is from Lady-day, 1892, to Lady-day, 1893; and a summary of work done will be found in Table 15. The work chiefly consisted in providing new drains to houses; water supply and apparatus to closets; new dustbins; removing nuisances caused by accumulations of manure, trade refuse, and animals ill-accommodated; disinfection of rooms, clothing, and bedding; attending at Police Courts; the condemning of unwholesome food; and various other matters. 152 Streets and blocks of houses have been inspected in the following places, viz.:—Wellington Street, Ralph Street, Great Dover Street, Queen's Row, South Street, Allen, East, Townley and Beresford Streets; North Row,Lestock Place, Walworth Road and Hill Street; Hard, New, Orb, Hope and Kingston Streets; Larcom, Henshaw, Ayliffe and Tabard Streets; Salisbury Buildings, New Kent Road and Little Mount Street; Westmoreland Road, Pen ton Place, Nelson Place, Charlotte Place and Angel Street; Barlow, Upper Bland, Lorrimore and Liverpool Streets; Brunswick Terrace, Uxbridge, Kingston, Faraday and Aylesbury Streets; Aldred Road and Royal Terrace, Cook's Road, Lucas Road, Otto Street, Cambridge Street, Union Court and Doddington Grove; Blewett Street, Osborne Street and Frederick Road; St. Paul's Road, Sutherland Place, William's Place, Dean's Buildings and Beddome Street; Thornton Street, Salisbury Row, James Street and Alvey Street; Portland, Gurney, Beckway and King and Queen Streets; Grosvenor Park, William's Grove, Longville Road, Acre and Heiron Streets; Brook, Webb, Phelp, Villa, Doctor and Albert Streets; Dante Road, Farmer's Road, Hill and Aldbridge Streets; Amery's Place, Violet Place, Camden and Thurlow Streets; Hodson, Crampton, Edward and Green Streets, Chapter Road, Hurlbatt Place, Sharsted, Devonshire and Rockingham Streets; St. David's, Harper, Tiverton and County Terrace Streets; Smyrk's Road, Lower Bland, Flint and Richmond Streets; Mann, Amelia and Eltham Streets, Lock Square, Ebenezer Terrace and Mina Road.

Milk. — Eighteen samples were taken ; ten were genuine, one contained 5 per cent, of added water, hut was in other respects good, and no proceedings were advised by the Analyst. In another case the milk contained 10 per cent, of added water, but before the summons came to the hearing the defendant had closed the shop and gone away. Two other samples were adulterated, one with 12 per cent, and the other with 20 per cent, of added water. In the first case a penalty of 40s. and 12s. 6d. costs was inflicted, and in the other case 20*. and 12s. 6d. costs. Four other summonses were taken out; but owing to a recent decision in the High Court they were defective, and were withdrawn. Mustard.— Four samples were taken, and were all found to be genuine. Pepper.— Four samples were taken, and were allfound to be genuine. Butter.— Twenty - six samples were taken ; thirteen were genuine ; of the remainder, one was adulterated with 70 per cent, of margarine, but as the offence was only that the letters on the label were too small, the vendor was cautioned. The rest were composed as follows:— Adulterated with margarine 80 per cent , fined 10/- and 12/6 costs. >> >t 75 ,, ,, 10/- ,, 2/- ,, it >> ^ >> >> 10/- ,, 2/- ,, „ 100 „ „ 10/- ., 12/6 „ >i »» 60 ,, ,, 10/- ,, 2/- ,, it >> 90 ,, ,, 10/- ,, 2/- „ 90 „ 40/- „ 12/6 „ 90 „ 40/- „ 12/6 „ 80 „ „ 40/- „ 12/6 >> >• 65 >» >> 40/- ,, 12/6 )( 80 „ „ 40/- „ 12/6 „ 100 „ „ 40/- „ 12/6 „ GEORGE MILLION. 160 TABLE A. 16 Table of Population, Births, and of New Cases of Infectious Sickness, coming to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health during the year 1892, in the Urban Sanitary District of Newington ; Classified according to Diseases, Ages and Localities.
