(6) WATER SUPPLY The water for the district is supplied by the Barnet District Gas and Water Company and the Colne Valley Water Company. With regard to the Barnet District Gas and Water Company, all the water is chlorinated, and a pathological staff is maintained. The water, in bulk, is examined daily and each pumping station once a week. 1,509 examinations of the water were made during the year, i.e. 205 Chemical and 1,304 Bacteriological. Of the Bacteriological samples, 1,172 were representative of supply and the percentage of first class (i.e. B. Coli absent in 100 millilitres), was 98.7. In addition to the above, fifty-five samples of water were submitted for independent bacteriological analysis, and all samples were reported to be of the highest standard of bacterial purity. The Colne Valley Water Company exercises constant supervision and members of the staff are on duty day and night throughout the year, examining samples. All the water supplied by this Company is chlorinated. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. The Town is drained and sewered on the separate system, excepting the older portions of the district where it is a combined system. The sewage is conveyed to an Irrigation Farm of 56 acres, but before it is turned on the land it is screened, and treated by means of detritus and sedimentation tanks, and three rotary filters. Pumping is necessary for three sewers which have their outlets at a low point on the farm. A few outlying properties are drained to cesspools, and part of Totteridge to the Finchley Borough Sewers. There are only a few earth closets in remote parts of the district. SANITARY CONDITIONS AND WATER SUPPLY OF SCHOOLS. There are eight public elementary schools in the district, viz;- Arkley Church of England Infants School; Byng Road County Council School (Junior Mixed and Infants and Senior Mixed Departments); Christ Church School, with Boys, Girls and Infants Departments; Barnet Church of England School (Senior Mixed Department) Totteridge Church of England School, (Boys, Girls and Infants); Grasvenor Avenue (Infants); St. Catherine's Roman Catholic Mixed School, and Underhill County Council School, (Junior Mixed Department and Infants Department.) The Assistant School Medical Officer visits each School at least once each term. She is in constant touch with the teachers, and all doubtful cases of illness are at once referred to her. Infectious cases and contacts are excluded from the Schools and disinfections are carried out when necessary. (7) DISPOSAL OF HOUSE REFUSE. The house refuse is collected weekly in covered mechanical conveyances and conveyed to the Farm and disposed of by the controlled tipping system. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS DISEASES.

To the Chairman and. Members of the Barnet Urban District Council. Mrs. Strugnell and Gentlemena, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report giving particulars of the measures carried out in my Department during the year 1942, in administering the Health Acts and Bye-Laws in force in the District. Owing to reduction in Staff, and to the large amount of work the Department is responsible for in connection with the Civil Defence Casualty Services, it has not been possible to do more than submit my report in a very condensed form, as compared with those of pre-war years. It is, therefore, in the main a statistical report, INSPECTION OF DISTRICT. General Inspections of the District have been carried out from time to time and all complaints investigated. The course of serving a preliminary or intimation notice upon the person in default, specifying the works necessary to abate the nuisance, continues to be followed, and only if a person fails to comply with this preliminary notice, or strict legal procedure is necessary in the first instance, is the matter reported to the Council and a statutory notice asked for. PUBLIC HEALTH ACT. 1936. INFECTIOUS DISEASES - INVESTIGATIONS AND DISINFECTIONS. The Infectious Diseases enumerated below have boon investigated and reported upon to your Medical Officer of Health:- Scarlet Fever 40; Diphtheria 1; Erysipelas 175 Enteric 5; and Pulmonary Tuberculosis 25. Fifty-four houses were disinfected wherein cases of Notifiable Infectious Diseases occurred, and bedding sent to be steam disinfected in certain cases. Fifty-two houses were disinfected after Scabies. In addition seventeen houses were disinfected on request, after cases of non- notifiable disease. In such a case a charge is made to cover labour and material. Ninety-eight library books from infectious houses were disinfected.

No further action was taken, therefore, by way of proceedings. PUBLIC HEALTH ACT. 1916. SECTION 75. Forty-six dustbins were provided after intimation to replace worn out receptacles, or absence of same. The provision of a proper sanitary dustbin is a very useful health measure. It also secures uniformity of receptacle and makes the task of the dustmen cleaner and easier. WATER SUPPLY. 192 cases of burst pipes occurred at the commencement of the year and repairs were carried out to same. In four cases the water was cut off owing to the non-payment of rates. This department was notified by the Barnet District Gas and Water Company, and steps were taken which resulted in the early reconnection of the supply. FACTORIES ACT. 1917. Thirty-three inspections of factories with mechanical power and nineteen inspections of factories without mechanical power were made during the year, including bake-houses. One factory was found to be without suitable sanitary accommodation for the men working therein. Notice was therefore served upon the owner to remedy the defects found, and this was complied with. One Certificate of adequate means of escape in case of firs was issued by the (5) HOUSING ACT 1935 - OVERCROWDING. As a result of the war it has been difficult to administer the provisions of the above Act with regard to overcrowding. An effort has, however, been made to prevent any serious overcrowding. Surveys have been carried out in respect of 15 houses, and these, together with those surveyed in previous years, make a total of 3,631 on the files of the department, from which a new start can be made after the war. APPLICATIONS FOR COUNCIL HOUSES.

Thirty-nine inspections were made, but there was no serious breach of Regulations to report. Tanks placed underground and supplying by means of pumps have practically taken the place of cans, and are much safer. These tanks and pumps now number 41. One licence was issued for storage of 112 lbs. of Carbide of Calcium. The scale of fees for licences to store petroleum ranges from 5/- for a quantity not exceeding 100 gallons, to £1 for a 1,000 - 5,000 gallons. (6) ERADICATION OF BED BUGS. (1) Number of Council Houses found to be infested 3 " " " " disinfested 3 Number of other houses found to be infested 19 " " " " disinfested 19 (2) An electric power sprayer has been used for disinfestations with a non-staining and non-poisonous fluid insecticide and both the sprayer and the insecticide have given highly satisfactory results.

(4) The work of disinfestation of houses belonging to the Council is carried out by the Housing Department Repairs Staff under the supervision of a Sanitary Inspector.
