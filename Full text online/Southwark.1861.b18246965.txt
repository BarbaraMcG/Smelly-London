This Report, being for the year ending on the 25th of March, 1861, is prepared and printed in pursuance of the provisions of the " Metropolis Local Management Act." The Sanitary condition of the Parish and the proceedings of the Vestry in relation thereto are amply detailed in the Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (See page 11). The General Proceedings of the Vestry are shewn by the Accounts and Statements (vouched by the Auditors) which immediately follow the Lists of Vestrymen and Officers. The prospect, intimated in the last Report, that the efforts made by the Yestry to meet the exigencies of the Parish with the greatest possible economy would lead to a reduction of the General Rate, has been fully realized. The Half Yearly General Rates made since have not exceeded 9d. in the Pound. To this Report are appended the Accounts of the Churchwardens for the year, from the date of their admission to that of the admission of their successors, which will be seen also to have been audited by the Auditors of the Parish. Any Parishioner not furnished with a copy of this Report will be supplied with one on application to the Yestry Clerk at the Yestry Hall. DANIEL BIRT, Vestry Clerk.

Dated this Eighth Day of May, 1861. f STEPHEN KNIGHT, JOSEPH WEBSTER, CHARLES BARNARD. WE, the undersigned, having audited the Accounts of the Vestry for the past year, have great pleasure in expressing our entire satisfaction with the mode in which those accounts have been prepared and submitted to us by the Vestry Clerk. We found neither a figure wrong, nor a voucher missing, and would append to our formal allowance our approbation of the lucid arrangement, and clear and beautiful penmanship, which appear to us to render them just what public accounts should be. STEPHEN KNIGHT, JOSEPH WEBSTER, CHARLES BARNARD. May 8th, 1861. 11 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. FOR THE YEAR ENDING LADY-DAY, 1861. Me. Chairman and Gentlemen, The time lias again come round, when it is my duty, to place before you the Annual Report of the mortality, and sanatory condition of the Parish. I am glad to be enabled to tell you of a diminished death rate;—for it is this "which, in the long run, will furnish the best proof of the improved health of the Parish, and of the increased comfort, and contentment of the people. The registered births have reached to 1862; and the deaths to 1239; thus giving an increase to the population of 623. There have been born, during the year, 915 Boys and 947 Girls; whilst 612 Males, and 627 Females have died. Thus we have experienced an annual death-rate of 20.34 in 1000 living. Now the death rate in 63 of the healthiest districts of England amounts to 17 in 1000 living: and there are a few districts in which the mortality is still lower, viz.—15 in 1000 living. Our death rate as I have stated, and which is corrected for increase of population, is 20.34 in that number. Hence during the year there have taken place in this Parish 204 deaths which would not have happened had St. George's been in as good and healthy a state as these 63 districts. I present you with a Table which shews the number of births and deaths that have happened in each quarter for five years, the period in which you have acted as Vestrymen.

The circumstances are various and complicated which contribute to prevent the improvement of the district, and even make the endeavour seem at times well nigh hopeless. No one can know the fertile sources there exist, for producing in the mind this feeling of despair, save those engaged in sanatory labours; or those, perchance, whose duty it may be to visit our poorest and lowest localities. There is however advance, although slow, for I find that the death rate in 1856-7 was 22 in 1000. We are then journeying forwards, and on that path which will lead eventually to the death rate desired; and which will have to be reached whatever obstacles may oppose, or hindrances delay. We shall nevertheless do well to remember that it is no light and easy work to remove the aggregate evils of centuries, which like the coral reefs of the ocean have grown up silently and continuously to their present magnitude: and place a people dwelling in the overcrowded and busy town upon an equality,—as regards the purity of the air they shall breathe, the means of cleanliness and the scope for the full and free developement of the physical powers they shall possess,—with those who dwell in the secluded village or lone farm-house. And it would but exhibit an unwise impatience, and a very narrow and limited view of the vastness of the labour before you, to expect sudden and striking evidences resulting from the efforts in which you have been for so short a time employed. To an onlooker there may appear no difficulty in carrying out the work readily and promptly, for work of whatever kind always seems easy to one who occupies such a position, and amazement may be expressed why this plain and palpable evil, or that grievous or filthy nuisance are not removed. But the business presents a very different view when looked upon from the "stand point" of the labourer. There are hindrances all around invisible to all but him, some of which are insurmountable, as those arising from the imperfection of the law itself, and which are gradually becoming more manifest. Then there are others where equity steps in to plead, and which pleadings may not righteously bo unheeded: there are also vested-rights, customs, ignorance, stupidity; and avarice; all of which have to be dealt with, and overcome if possible. Amid these conflicts there is much to be effected which time and experience alone can teach us to accomplish. I shall now proceed to examine more closely the causes which have brought about the 1239 deaths. There have been 258 deaths from zymotic diseases; diseases which include small-pox, measles, scarlatina, typhus-fever, hooping-cough, and the like. This class of diseases is greatly under control, can be prevented to a great extent by the carrying out of sanatory measures. Some of them indeed which have carried death and distress into numerous households, and have proved the factors of poverty, and its attendant evils may, I sincerely believe, be completely got rid of,—banished from the catalogue of human woes. And these necessarily act as a delicate test of oui- sanatory state; they are the indexes that mark unerringly our care, or neglect. You will see from Table No. 2, that the deaths from small-pox have been 14; and that these all occurred in the first quarter. Compare this with the deaths from the same cause in 1859-60 : then there fell stricken by this disease 88. Yaccination has doubtless been latterly more universally practised: but this marked decrease is owing as well to the wearing out of the epidemic, and scarcity of victims. Parents have been taught a severe lesson; and their ever ready and flimsy objections to vaccination ruthlessly swept away. They have been called to mourn over the. deaths of their offspring from one of the foulest diseases which afflicts, or has ever afflicted humanity; or to take unto themselves shame and sorrow for the now disfigured face of a previously fair and lovely child. And not always have the parents themselves been spared; 13 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1860. one and another have been taken away, to the sore and irreparable loss of their families. Nature never pardons. Obey and it is well: disobey and reap the bitter consequences. TABLE No. 2. 1856—57 1857—58 1858—59 1859—60 1860—61 ZYMOTIC DISEASES.

The latter disease has been very prevalent of late. The deaths from diarrhoea have undergone a remarkable decrease from the last and previous years, falling from 69 deaths in the year ending March 1860, to 28 in the present. The causes of this decrease have been the coldness of the stimmer of 1860, and the great quantity of rain which fell, and washed away all impurities out of the atmosphere from off the roads, and out of the sewers. The opposite state of the weather invariably proves favourable to abdominal diseases. During the cholera epidemic in 1832, the rain fall was one fourth less than the average: and in 1849 and 1854 there was a total absence of rain during its prevalence. TABLE No. 3.

The most fatal of all common diseases is consumption, which has caused 173 deaths: then follows bronchitis, giving 105; and inflammation of the lungs 90.

There have been five deaths from delirium-tremens ; but these deaths are far from indicating the number of which intemperance has been the cause. There have been 44 deaths from premature births and debility, and 94 from old age. Thirty-five deaths have occurred from violence and privation, some of which I will particularise. Six children have died from suffocation. Two women have been burnt to death from their clothes taking fire, aged respectively 49 and 71. A child was run over by a mourning coach, and died two hours after the accident. A woman, aged 40, died from compression of the brain, by falling from a ladder; as did also a man, aged 66. Five children were scalded to death by the upsetting of boiling water, tea, broth, and starch. A woman, aged 62, was suffocated whilst swallowing a large piece of tripe. A woman, aged 53, died during the frost in January, from exposure to the cold whilst intoxicated. Another, aged 49, from congestion of the brain, brought on by a blow on the right eye, from a piece of iron. A man, aged 25, died from rupture of the intestines, the effect of running against the shaft of a cart. Two male children, aged 2 and 3, died from poison, supposed to be arsenic; but how taken could not be discovered. A female child, aged 16 months, was starved to death by the mother, against whom the jury brought a verdict of wilful murder. A man, aged 53, committed suicide by blowing out his brains with a gun and small shot. Another, aged 48, threw himself from an upper window, and died a few hours afterwards. A man, aged 31, hung himself by means of a handkerchief fastened to a hook in the wall of his bed-room. A photographer killed himself by taking cyanide of potassium. This poisonous compound is now extensively used for the purpose of photography, and is easily obtained, a reason that has led to its being frequently employed as a means of self-destruction. A jury presiding over one of the many cases which have lately happened, recommended all chemists and druggists not to supply this drug, except to those whom they know, or upon a written order, the signature of which might be indisputable. It is well for the prevention of murder that the sale of poisons be forbidden; but it is a great fallacy to suppose that such a measure will "put down" suicide. If the intending self-murderer be denied the use of one means of death, then he will select another, and the most ready at hand, and so complete his purpose. 15 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1860. Table No. 5 gives you the analysis of the water of the Lambeth and Southwark Companies, made by Dr. R. D. Thomson, and published in the weekly returns of the Begistrar General. There is also the analysis of the water from a well in Bexley Street, Camberwell, the water of which is more impure than that taken from the well in Blackmail Street; the total impurities of the former being 214'0 in the gallon; the latter, 136'0. This tells favourably for the water given us by the companies. TABLE No. 5. Total Impurity per Gallon Organic Impurity per Gallon. Total Impurity per Gallon.

''The days and nights were remarkably cold; in fact, April was colder than in any year sinoe 1839; and June since 1821. This month was also noticeable for the large rain fall, more having fallen than in any year since 1815. The temperatures of July, August, and September were all below the average. There is no other instance on record of so low a mean temperature of the four months, June, July, August, and September as 55°.9". "The excess of rain at Greenwich in the nine months was 6.0 inches." The close of the year was unusually cold. After December 18th the cold was intense. "On Christmas-day, 25th, the temperature of the air fell to 7°, on the 29th to 8° Fahrenheit." "In December there was a large fall of rain, and the atmospheric pressure was also low."* The following Table contains the names of the streets in which some of the principal Zymotic, lung diseases, and brain and nervous diseases of children have occurred. The Table is suggestive, and will repay examination, especially to those acquainted with the localities. *See Quarterly Returns by the authority of the Registrar General, from which the above is extracted. 16 Parish of St. Oeorge the Martyr, Southward.

A number of houses forming Potier-place, and Noel's-court, Bermondsey, have been removed for the purpose of erecting' a school. These houses were of the worst description, having no yards, nor even windows behind, so that ventilation was impossible. I am sorry to say that there are numbers of similar houses still standing, and occupied as these were, by the most ignorant and degraded of our population: a class living almost in the neglect of laws human and divine; and as heedless about the present and the future as the very heathen themselves, for whom such a vast amount of sympathy is claimed, and machinery set in motion, to better their condition. Besides the school, there is a small space left which may serve as a play-ground; a purpose becoming imperatively necessary. It would appear, from the building of so many churches, that they are considered as a specific for the evils which now afflict us, and which are constantly claiming our attention. I would seriously ask, What avails such a remedy? The poor cannot go into them; will not go into them; and if they did, what benefit would be likely to follow? For are they not utterly ignorant of the very elements of Christianity, and even of the name of its founder, except to add emphasis to an oath? In many of our localities, I believe moral influence would be powerless. And here is the time and place for the sanatory reformer: here lies before him, plain enough, the work which he has to do, and ho must give him- 18 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southward. self no rest until it be accomplished: he must act as the pioneer to the teacher and pastor, otherwise their labours will prove of no advantage. Reformation of the masses must begin by making them homes; homes worthy of the name, such as a man could rejoice in, and be proud of. Not allowing them to dwell in places where no man would put his horse, or his ass. Nay, I have read that some sties were built in a provincial town, but not being found suitable for pigs, they were converted into cottages. The state and condition of the dwellings of the poorer classes are a stain upon our civilization, but fortunately one which maybe effectually rubbed out. And the sooner this is brought to pass, the better will it be for society. It is a subject, not for regret, to hear of the sweeping away of court, alley, lane, and obscure street. It is a benefit to the Parish, morally and economically, that cannot be too highly valued. For the construction and arrangements of the houses are such as to defy any good being obtained in the way of sanatory improvement. Liverpool had the unenviable notoriety of being the unhealthiest town in England. In 1837 the mortality was at the death rate of 39 in 1000. And why? There were 4,700 cellars in which were no windows, and no openings, except the entrance door at the top. The flooring was simply bare earth, and the receptacle of all the filth and refuse of the dwellers in them. "What wonder that this merchant city enjoyed such a bad preeminence? It took from 1842-9 to clear out the 20,000 occupiers. This done, the result shewed in 1849 that the mortality had fallen to 29; 10 in 1000 thus being annually saved. Neither man nor woman can always strive. Those who contend long and bravely against their untoward lot, at last give up the strife. And no one can conceive, nor would they believe—unless eye-witnesses—the wretched circumstances in which vast numbers of families have to spend their lives. It is indescribable. The daily task of keeping clean their houses and families—once a pleasure to them as well as a duty—having to be constantly performed amid overwhelming obstacles on every side, from which no hope of escape remains to cheer them on,—is gradually neglected, and ultimately abandoned: their spirits become torpid and depressed; and this is necessarily followed by the derangement of the functions of the body. Finally they become recldess, and this recklessness increases the evil which gave it birth. There is action and reaction. What marvel, then, that bke unto those about them, they float down the ebb tide towards the dead sea of physical dirt and moral degradation. It has been truly said by Dr. South wood Smith, "the wretchedness being greater than humanity can bear, annihilates the mental feelings, the faculty distinctive of the human being." Hence, then, the good which must follow the destruction of unfit habitations. The decrease of them even, will drive their occupants to better houses, situated in more open neighbourhoods, where surrounded by higher influences, and more exposed to the view of the passer by, they will be induced to practise habits of self-denial, thriftiness, and respect to the proprieties of life: and opportunity will be given for the developement of faculties hitherto lying dormant, and repressing those wluch have been too active, or quite wrongly directed. The ascent in the scale of humanity will be commenced, and their minds prepared to receive tho elements of education and religion. The heedlessness shewn in the building of houses is astonishing. No care is taken about the nature of the subsoil, the position, the ventilation, and means of cleanliness. They are run up anywhere, and almost anyhow, and too often become the prolific source of disease. "No man has a right to erect a nuisance: and the public has clearly as good a right, and as great an interest in enforcing cleanliness, to prevent the outbreak of an 19 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1860. epidemic as in requiring walls to prevent the spread of fire." Yet where one is destroyed by fire, how many thousands are there by disease, the indirect result of such erections. Only in the one case death comes suddenly and in the awfullest of forms, whilst in the other it comes softly and more slowly, but not the less surely. It is high time that there should come an end to the building of the like habitations, only good for the manufacture of disease, and for men, women, and children to be huddled together in " their rags and laughing savagery." However, even from this dark outlook there arises hope in the far distance, and the confident expectation of better things. Landlords are fast coming to the knowledge that these places do not pay: that where sickness is, there poverty abounds. Mr. W. Little, a builder, in his evidence before the Health of Towns Commission, stated that three-fifths of the loss he sustained from the lower classes of houses in rent was from sickness. And I have no doubt but that this statement would be borne out by most landlords. Self interest and humanity here fortunately go hand in hand, being agreed. The tether to which all wrong doers are fixed is but of limited extent: and whilst much woe and suffering may, and do arise from that margin of liberty, yet it is certain there must come an end to it. Numberless are the checks which he around on every hand, and act when needed. And so this appeal to the pocket, if one of the lowest, will not be the least powerful in its result. Perhaps I should not omit mentioning what has been done in the way of improvement of dwellings, by the erection of model lodging houses, and which have proved so salutary to those occupying them; by preventing disease, reducing greatly the mortality of children, and preserving them unscathed amid the ravages of the cholera epidemic. These have been followed up, and improved upon by Miss Burdett Coutts, who has lately had erected comfortable dwellings, for the industrious poor, and at rents to meet their means. They are fitted up so as to satisfy every sanatory requirement; and as if they were intended for man to dwell in. If prevention is better than cure, then is this the most legitimate way of spending money for beneficial purposes. Par better than leaving so much for the cure of disease when created. It costs a great deal to make sickness, and it costs more to cure it: why not then prevent it ? We are desperately careless about our health; and apparently esteem it of small value. A great modern author has truly and emphatically said, "The first wealth is health .... No labor, pains, temperance, poverty, nor exercise that can gain it must be grudged. For sickness is a cannibal which eats up all the life and youth it can lay hold of, and absorbs its own sons and daughters. I figure it as a pale, wailing, distracted phantom, absolutely selfish, heedless of what is good and great, attentive to its sensations, losing its soul and afflicting other souls with meanness and mopings, and with ministration to its voracity of trifles."
