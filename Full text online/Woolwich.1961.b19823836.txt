STANDRING, M.D., B.S., D.P.H., M R.C.S., L.R.C.P., F.R.S.H. Medical Officer of Health METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF WOOLWICH ANNUAL REPORT on the Health of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich for the Year 1961 by T. Standring, M.D.,B.S.,D.P.H.,M.R.C.S.,L.R.C.P.,F.R.S.H. Medical Officer of Health P_R_E_F_A_C_E To: The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich. MR. MAYOR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have pleasure in submitting the 6lst Annual Report on the Health of the Borough of Woolwich. The Report is on the general lines indicated by the Minister of Health. There was a further increase in the total population of the Borough to 146,850, being 1,380 more than in the previous year, due mainly to the housing work of the Council and the County Council. While the Borough's Birth and Infant Death rates remained constant, there was a rise in the Death rate to 11.7, as compared with 10.4 for 1960. The main increases were in deaths from heart and circulatory diseases, and chest diseases, giving the Borough's highest Death rate since 1951. The rate, however, still compared favourably with London as a whole (11.9), and the national figure of 12.0. There is no apparent environmental cause and too much weight must not be given to an isolated year, especially when relatively small numbers are involved. There must, however, be no complacency, and next year's figures will be awaited. Infectious diseases presented no particular problem, although this was a 'measles' year, with over 3,000 notifications. Notwithstanding the occurrence of cases elsewhere in the Metropolis, there were no cases of diphtheria, and only one case of poliomyelitis. This was due in large measure to the continuous effort by the County Council in their diphtheria and poliomyelitis inoculation schemes. Although parents may be unfamiliar with the disease it remains of prime importance that vaccination and inoculation are kept at a high level. Smallpox was absent from the Borough during the whole of the year. However, early in 1962 Woolwich had its first case of smallpox for many years. After the immediate isolation of the patient, all known close contacts of the case were ascertained and immediately vaccinated and placed under surveillance. Other less -2- direct contacts were also vaccinated and visited daily. Although a further suspected case not connected with the original confirmed case was removed to the isolation hospital for observation within two days of the original case, fortunately this proved not to be smallpox. Owing to public demand, emergency arrangements for vaccination sessions at County Council Centres and by all local Doctors were immediately instituted, and within the space of a fortnight a large percentage of the population of the Borough had been vaccinated. A fuller report on this incident will be included in the Report for 1962. Because of the extensive clearance and demolition of unfit houses in the Borough during the past decade, and an appreciable improvement in the general standard of repair of houses, the housing work of the Public Health Inspectors is changing. The accent is now less on the abatement of nuisances and more on improvement grant applications, the drive for clean air, and the reduction of noise in all its forms. The Council's programme for Clean Air continued to progress satisfactorily. At the end of the year the Council had eleven Areas covering some 1,750 acres of the Borough under Smoke Control, with a further four Areas covering 1,100 acres due to come into operation in the autumn of 1962. Preliminary surveys of further large areas of the Borough were also being carried out at the end of the year. Following a review of the Council's Clean Air programme the target date by which the whole of the Borough should be subject to Smoke Control was brought forward to 1968. In conclusion, I welcome this opportunity of acknowledging the help and co-operation I have received from the Members of the Council, and from colleagues. I should also like to thank the staff of my Department for their valued support during the year. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, T.

Four of the deaths occurred in persons over 60. There were four deaths from poisoning, being in all cases from accidental inhalation of domestic gas, including a case where a boiling kettle extinguished the flames. All the victims were over 75. -14- Burns from ignited clothing caused the death of a woman over 70, and there was a death from wounding of a child of eighteen months.

Samples of water so supplied are regularly subjected to chemical and bacteriological examination by the Board at its own laboratories. The water supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board in this area is not subject to plumbo-solvent action. At the end of the year the number of occupied dwellinghouses was estimated at 44,944; water being piped to all these houses by the Board direct from its mains. Local industries are also supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board, but for industrial uses and fire fighting additional supplies are taken from seven wells which are still in use in the Borough. Well water is also used at the Council's swimming baths at Woolwich and Plumstead. Samples of the well water taken for bacteriological examination showed it to be satisfactory. DRAINAGE The number of drainage defects discovered during 1961 totalled 274, and the work of repair or reconstruction was supervised by the Public Health Inspectors. Of a total of thirty-two private and combined drains smoke tested 17 were found to be defective. One of these, a disused drain, was subsequently exposed by the staff of the Department and sealed off. Of the forty-three combined drains inspected and tested during the year, one was found to be defective and Notices were served under the provisions of Section 40 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 on the various owners concerned. The work of repair and reconstruction was carried out by the Borough Engineer's Department, and the cost of the necessary work was shared between the responsible owners. PUBLIC BATHS AND PADDLING P00LS At all of the Council's Swimming Baths the water is continuously filtrated and chlorinated. Samples of the water from the Swimming Baths and from the Paddling Pools are taken as a routine for testing. -17- Samples of water were submitted to the Southern Group Laboratory, Hither Green Hospital, for bacteriological examination, and were also tested for Chlorine content and pH reaction by the Health Department staff. The average results of the tests and examinations are shown below:- Probable No. of Bacillus Coli per 100 m.l. Average PH Value Average free Chlorine p.p.m. Average Temperature. Plate Count.

An additional 72 persons were employed by firms in the Borough but who themselves lived outside the Borough. The houses of the Outworkers are visited periodically to ensure that the standard of cleanliness and working conditions generally are satisfactory. -19- The nature of the work is as follows:- Nature of Work No. of Outworkers in August list required by Sec. 110(1)(c).

In 31 instances it was necessary to serve formal Statutory Notices; in the other cases new dustbins were provided following receipt of Intimation Notices. It was not found necessary to institute legal proceedings against any owner to enforce compliance with a Notice. WOODWORM AND OTHER PESTS Many requests were received from occupiers for advice and assistance in ridding their premises of insect pests, and altogether 358 visits were carried out in this connection by the Public Health Inspectors. The majority of complaints was again of woodworm, and in all 52 houses were disinfested of woodworm by the Department's staff. A Community Centre owned by the Council was treated to clear it of ants, and five premises were disinfested of cockroaches. -20- A house was also treated for wet wood rot, and another heavily infested with moth was successfully treated by the Department. In dealing with requests to destroy wasps nests the practice, which was started two years ago, of sprinkling powder containing 0.5 Dieldrin at the entrance of the nest was successfully continued. During the summer 21 wasps nests were destroyed in this manner, each with a single treatment. The charges made to the responsible persons for the costs of the work mentioned above totalled £l89.11.6d. RAG FLOCK Regular inspections are carried out by the Public Health Inspectors of premises where rag flock and other filling materials are manufactured or stored. There are three registered premises where filling materials are used and to which the Rag Flock and other Filling Materials Act applies. One licence to manufacture rag flock was renewed by the Council in the course of the year. The following samples were submitted for analysis:- 2 samples of Rag Flock 2 samples of Woollen Mixture Felt 1 sample of New Cotton Felt. All the samples passed the prescribed standard of cleanliness. The Analyst reported, however, that both samples of Woollen Mixture Felt failed to meet the quality standard of a minimum 60% animal fibre content required to describe the material as Woollen Mixture Felt. Although the failures were failures in quality only and as such is not enforceable under the provisions of the Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, the attention of the manufacturer was nevertheless drawn to the deficiency. CINEMAS Regular inspections of the sanitary conveniences in Cinemas were carried out during the year. In general the standard of cleanliness in the conveniences was very good. -21- SHOPS ACT, 1950 Under the provisions of the Shops Act, 1950 the Borough Council is responsible for ensuring that temperature, ventilation and sanitary accommodation is suitably maintained in shops. Since 1959 the Council has been responsible also for ensuring the suitability of lighting, washing facilities, and facilities for employees to take meals in the shops in which they are employed. In all, the Public Health Inspectors made 325 Shops Act Inspections during the course of the year. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT, 1933 At the end of the year under review names were entered in the Council's list of persons entitled to sell Part II poisons (other than Registered Pharmacists) in respect of 142 premises. NOISE ABATEMENT The passing of the Noise Abatement Act in 1960 was given wide publicity both in the press and on the radio, and the public is now more noise conscious than ever before. This is evidenced by the number of complaints dealt with during the year. Below are details of complaints that were abated by the Department without, however, recourse to the statutory powers provided by the Noise Abatement Act or the Byelaw made by the Council to deal with noise nuisance. Complaints Included:- Noise from a neighbour's radio set. A loudspeaker used by a Preacher on a street corner. Noisy potato chipping machine Installed in a fried fish shop. A stores depot where old pipes were broken up. Chimes from an ice-cream vendor's van. Vans engaged in delivering milk to various schools In the early hours of the morning. Noise from a factory engaged on panel beating. Noise from belt-driven machinery used in a local laundry. A number of complaints were received from nearby residents of noise from motor cycles whose riders had congregated, particularly at weekends, in the car park of a Public House on the Sidcup Road. The riders would "rev" their engines In the car park and leave at -22- high speed causing excessive noise, only to return within a short time and repeat the process into the early hours of the morning. Observations were kept at week-ends by the Public Health Inspectors, and subsequently the aid of the Police was enlisted. The presence of the Police was an undoubted deterrent to the riders, but the nuisance was finally abated when the section of road used by the riders of the motor cycles was restricted to a speed limit, and more especially, after two youths were heavily fined in the local Magistrates Court for exceeding the speed limit in the section of road concerned. RODENT CONTROL During 1961 a total of 22,855 premises were inspected for evidence of rat or mice Infestation. Of that number 1,171 premises were inspected as a direct result of complaints of rats from the occupiers, and 478 calls were made following complaints of mice infestations. The remaining 19,258 premises were visited under the 'block' control scheme. In all 'block' control schemes were carried out in the Borough during the year. Including industrial and business premises, 2,102 properties were disinfested of either rats or mice. Treatment is carried out by the Council free of charge at all private dwellings; for industrial and business premises a charge is made. Where defects of a structural nature are found to be causing an infestation the remedy is pursued with the owner of the property. Although it was not found necessary to serve any formal Notices during the year under the provisions of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 31 drains suspected of being defective were smoke tested by the staff of the Department, and in 22 cases the tests showed the drains to be defective. Following informal action by the Department, the defects so discovered were subsequently remedied by the responsible owners. Two sewer treatments and test baiting of the sewers were carried out this year in conjunction with the staff of the Borough Engineer. The practice of baiting each manhole on the first and fourth day, and poison baiting on the eighth day was continued. Zinc phosphide was used, with paranitrophenol as a preservative. Where -23- complete 'takes' of the bait were recorded repeated baiting was carried out. HAIRDRESSERS' PREMISES AND BARBERS' SHOPS Section 18 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954 requires a person carrying on the business of a hairdresser or barber, as well as the premises used for that purpose, to register with the Borough Council. The Council's Byelaws also lay down the minimum hygiene standards to which premises and equipment must conform. For this purpose all the hairdressing establishments and barbers' shops are periodically inspected. During the year nine applications were received for registration of Ladies. hairdressing premises, one Gentlemen's premises, and one combined premises, making a total of 62 Ladies', 44 Gentlemen's, and nine combined premises registered by the Council. STREET CLEANSING There are over 161 miles of roads to be cleansed in the Borough, of which 15 per cento are swept at least once daily; 20 per cent. three to six times weekly; 55 per cento twice weekly; and 10 per cent. once weekly. Eighty-eight street sweepers are employed on the work, and, in addition, a mechanical sweeper and sprinkler is used to sweep the main traffic routes in the Borough and the roads in the shopping areas of Powis Street, Plumstead High Street, and Eltham High Street. Approximately 9,650 street gullies are cleansed periodically by mechanical gully cleansing machines. HOUSE AND TRADE REFUSE During the year under review, 40,880 tons of refuse were collected by the Council's vehicles and 42,000 tons disposed of at the Council's Refuse Destructor. The difference between the two weights is largely the quantity of refuse delivered to the Refuse Destructor from the Royal Arsenal and from trade premises. Some 1,874 tons of scrap metal, 1,447 tons of waste paper, and 135 tons of textiles were salvaged and sold during the year, producing an income of £l3,280. -24- PUBLIC CONVENIENCES An additional convenience was built during the year adjacent to Woolwich New Road Car Park (with access in Sandy Hill Road), making a total of twenty conveniences for men, and a similar number for women, within the Borough. In all conveniences the water closets are available without charge. Free Washing Facilities- For the past ten years, the Council has provided free washing facilities at the main public conveniences, including the provision of paper towels, and this service continues to be used to an increasing extent and is much appreciated by the public. Paid washing facilities, which include the supply of a linen towel, are also available. The above information on Street Cleansing,House and Trade Refuse, and Public Conveniences, has been kindly supplied by the Borough Engineer. PUBLIC BATHS AND WASHHOUSES The Council has four bathing establishments in the Borough. This service includes Swimming Baths, Slipper Baths, Turkish Baths, Public Laundry, and the use of the Eltham Baths Public Hall in winter for social and sporting activities. The attendance figures for the Public Laundry during the past five years are as follows:- 1960/61 - 24,211; 1959/60 - 23,570; 1958/59 - 26,081; 1957/58 - 23,939; and 1956/57 - 18,295. Attendances for Slipper Baths in 1960/61 totalled 104,986, and the total attendances for all services for the year was 729,423, a decrease of 19,537 over the year 1959/60. Altogether 188,370 school children attended at the Baths in organised classes for swimming and swimming instruction, and 6,773 swimming lessons were provided for members of the public. The Modernisation Scheme at Woolwich Baths was completed during the year and much improved facilities are now available to the public at that Establishment. The detailed attendances for the year ended 31st March, 1961 were as follows:- -25- Public Swimming 346,354 Swimming Tuition 6,773 School Swimming 188,370 Slipper Baths 104,986 Turkish Baths 9,337 Public Laundry - Hand Washing 8,060 Machine Washing 16,151 Swimming Club 40,066 Schoolchildren - Cricket School 2,220 Free Baths to Old Age Pensioners and Unemployed Persons 7,106 729,423 The above information has been kindly supplied by the Baths Administrative Officer. ELTHAM CREMATORIUM The Crematorium situated in the grounds adjoining Eltham Cemetery, is administered by the Woolwich, Greenwich, and Northwest Kent Joint Crematorium Committee, which comprises the Boroughs of Woolwich, Greenwich, Bexley, Dartford, Erith, and Gravesend, and the Urban Districts of Chislehurst and Sidcup, and Crayford. The Crematorium was opened in August, 1956. The number of cremations taking place at this Crematorium during 1961 totalled 2,665, being 304 more than the previous year, and the highest number of cremations at any Crematorium in South-East London. BURIALS AND CREMATIONS During the year arrangements were made by the Department for the burial of four persons who had died in the Borough, where no other suitable arrangements were being made for their burial. All these persons were elderly. The Council's expenses amounted to £51, of which £27 was recovered from the Estates of the deceased persons. -26- OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE There are now some 20,000 residents in the Borough of pensionable age, but fortunately only a small minority of those over retirement age require urgent health and welfare help. However, many new eases requiring assistance came to the knowledge of the Health Department during the year, and in cooperation with the various voluntary and statutory workers in this field, all requests for help were promptly investigated and assistance given or arranged wherever necessary. The Council's Woman Visitor and her Assistant regularly visit over 1,100 elderly persons in the Borough, who are often living alone, and altogether these two Officers made over 5,000 visits for this purpose during the year. There is continued close co-operation with General Practitioners, the County Council's Welfare Department, Home Help Organisers, the National Assistance Board, the Borough Council Housing Department, and with voluntary workers. Particular mention should be made of the helpful assistance given by Dr. Lewis, the Geriatrician at the Brook Hospital, and her staff. District Nurses, Home Helps, the W.V.S., and the staff of the Old People's Welfare Committee of the Council of Social Service also play an important part in maintaining the happiness and well-being of the elderly in the Borough, It was not found necessary to apply to the Courts for the compulsory removal of any person during the year. In several cases the Department assisted in the voluntary admission of persons to hospital or to a suitable Home. INCONTINENT LAUNDRY SERVICE In view of the increased demand during the year for the laundering of soiled linen of the incontinent aged, this service was expanded and a new washing machine and ironer were installed at the Council's Disinfecting Station. All applicants for this service are visited to ensure that no other suitable arrangements can be made. The service is provided under powers contained in the Public Health (London) Act, and the work is carried out by the Department's disinfecting staff. The average number of persons using this service at any one -27- time was twenty. Altogether 25,352 articles were laundered during the year, as follows:- Night Attire 1,012; Sheets and Draw Sheets 6,971; Blankets 248; Pillow Cases 1,870; Towels 2,84l; Underwear and Wearing Apparel 5,435 Quilts and Bedspreads 162; Miscellaneous 4,795. BATHING AND CLEANSING A number of aged persons are regularly conveyed to the Council's Bathing Centre and returned home after bathing. Where a person cannot conveniently attend the Bathing Centre under these arrangements, the staff of the Health Department carry out home bathing, and altogether 103 elderly persons were bathed in their own homes during 1961. In addition, a large number of the more active pensioners take advantage of the arrangements for hot baths at a reduced price at the Council's Baths. HOLIDAY SCHEME The General Secretary of the Council of Social Service has reported that 160 old people enjoyed a week's holiday at Westgate during 1961. They travelled in four parties; two parties going in May and two in September. Accommodation was booked in the same two Guest Houses as in the previous year. Each party was accompanied on the coach journey by a voluntary escort, and a voluntary helper and his wife stayed in one of the two Guest Houses during the whole of the four weeks' holiday period at his own expense, in order to keep an eye on the visitors, and in addition he was able to arrange outings for the Woolwich party. The Secretary reported that a welcome facility was made available to the old people while at Westgate by being given temporary membership of the British Legion Club, and members of the Westgate Over 60 Club also extended an invitation to the visitors from Woolwich. The old people made a contribution of 35/-d. each towards the cost of the holiday, except in three cases where there was a slight reduction because of straightened circumstances. -28- A grant was made by the Borough Council towards the cost of this scheme. In addition to the organised parties, help was also given by the Council of Social Service towards the cost of a holiday for seven other elderly people too frail or handicapped to go away with the main parties. For them accommodation was found in Homes where nursing care was available. MEALS ON WHEELS The mobile meals service operating in the Borough was supplemented during the year by the use of a new van presented to the Borough Council by a local firm. With the addition of this third van it was possible to expand the service to provide each old person on the mobile meals rota with three meals per week instead of two. The new van is fitted with four portable electric heaters, which can cater for 40 complete meals. Arrangements for the delivery of the mobile meals were made by the W.V.S. In conjunction with the Council of Social Service. Under new powers given by the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1961 Metropolitan Borough Councils are now enabled to provide, or make such other arrangements as they may decide for the provision of an Invalid Meals service in their area. The Borough Council will be prepared to consider using these new powers should the need arise. LUNCH CLUB FACILITIES The three lunch clubs which operate in the Borough continue to be popular. Two of these are run by the Council of Social Service at Plumstead and Eltham, and the third is run by The Victorians at the Sherard Road club. CHRISTMAS PARCELS SCHEME Under a scheme sponsored by His Worship the Mayor (Councillor G.E. Offord, J.P.) it was possible last Christmas, with the aid of several voluntary organisations in the Borough, to distribute over 700 parcels to elderly Woolwich residents. This gesture was very much appreciated by the old folk in the -29- Borough, as was also the help given by the various voluntary bodies in this work. HOUSING REPAIRS The number of occupied dwellinghouses in the Borough at the end of the year was estimated to be 44,944. Premises inspected for defects during the year under the Public Health (London) Act, and the Housing Act, totalled 2,282. Of the total number inspected, 776 houses were found to be not in all respects reasonably fit for habitation. A total of 517 houses were rendered fit by informal action, which included the service of 658 Intimation Notices. In 309 instances it was necessary to serve Statutory Notices to ensure that the necessary work was carried out. OVERCROWDING As a result of complaints from occupiers or on routine inspections, 29 families were visited in connexion with overcrowding. Eight families were found to be living in accommodation that was statutorily overcrowded, and these cases were reported to the Housing Department. Where a request is received from an owner for a statement of the permitted number of persons in respect of a dwelling, it is the responsibility of the local authority to supply the necessary information in writing. 125 such requests were received and met during the year. INDIVIDUAL UNFIT HOUSES The following houses were represented by me during the year as unfit for human habitation, and Demolition or Closing Orders were made by the Council as follows:- Demolition Orders - 173 Herbert Road 43 Nightingale Vale 57 Rippolson Road. -30- Closing Orders - 75 Hudson Road 4l Woodrow 11 Fennell Street 4l Hudson Road 278 Albert Road, E.l6. 11 Elraley Street 32 Elmley Street Converted Omnibus, 57 Harrow Manorway. During the year the Council determined Closing Orders in respect of:- 18 Merchland Road; 12 Gavin Street (Basement front room); and 137 Herbert Road (Basement rooms). SLUM CLEARANCE AREAS Further progress was made by the Council during 1961 in its Slum Clearance work, particularly in the St. Mary's and Glyndon Redevelopment Areas. The following Borough Council Clearance Areas were confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government during the year:- Date confirmed by Minister Church Hill No. 1 Area - Nos: 3-21 (odd) Church Hill 24th March,1961 Church Hill No. 2 Area - Nos: 31 & 32 Church Hill 2nd March,1961 John Wilson Street Area - Nos: 46-60 (even), 60a, 12th July, 1961 62-68 (even), 51, 53, 59-87 (odd) John Wilson Street; 1-8 (cons.), l4a, 15-17(cons.) Monk Street; 1-13 (cons.) Clara Place; 37c, 38-40 (cons.), 42-50 (cons.) Castile Road. Southport Road Area - Nos: 32-60 (even) Southport 3rd February,1961 Road. Kirkham Street Area - Nos: 26-64 (even), 68, 17th February,1961 23-27 (odd), 31-69 (odd) Kirkham Street; 18-58 (even), 9-29 (odd) Ravine Grove. At the beginning of the year I represented to the Council that the following additional areas in the St. Mary's Redevelopment Area should be dealt with in accordance with the Council's Slum Clearance programme. -31- Kingsman Street (No. 1) Area - 219-223 (odd) Kingsman Street. Kingsman Street (No. 2) Area - 205-215 (odd) Kingsman Street. Kingsman Street (No. 3) Area - 127 and 129 Kingsman Street. St. Mary's Street Area - 12-24 (even) St. Mary's Street. Bowling Green Row (No. l) Area - 1-10 (cons.) Bowling Green Row. Bowling Green Row (No. 2) Area - 124-128 (even) Woolwich Church Street; 1-11 (odd) Prospect Vale; Steer's Cottage, Marshall's Grove. Bowling Green Row (No. 3) Area - 1-6 (cons.) Marshall's Grove Bowling Green Row (No. 4) Area - 26-28 (cons.) Marshall's Grove. Included in the above unfit properties are nine business premises with living accommodation on floors above. These eight Areas, which comprise 47 dwellings, with occupants totalling 117 in 50 families, completed the Council's five-year Slum Clearance programme ended December, 1960. HOUSING ACT, 1961 This Act confers on local authorities more extensive powers to deal with houses in multiple occupation, and enables the Ministry to prescribe a Code of Management for such houses. A local authority is also given power to require work to be carried out to make good or safeguard prescribed standards of management, and to require particular work to be carried out in order to make such properties more suitable for multi-family occupation. In particular, a local authority can require essential facilities to be provided, such as the provision of additional sanitary accommodation, water supply, and facilities for preparing and cooking food, having regard to the number of families or households living in the premises. Fortunately, in Woolwich there are few houses let in multiple occupation, and no special difficulties have been experienced under previous legislation. CERTIFICATES OF UNFITNESS During the year Certificates of Unfitness were issued in respect -32- of 9 Belson Road; 49 Rectory Place; 10, 12-16 (cons.), 19-21 (cons.), 23 and 25 Marshall's Grove; 2 and 3 Carolina Place; 3 Chapel Hill; and 170-176 (even) Bostall Lane. REVISED UNDERGROUND ROOM REGULATIONS Following the issue of new model Underground Room Regulations the Council made revised Regulations for the proper ventilation and lighting of underground rooms, and submitted them to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government for approval. These Regulations are now in force. However, the Council's policy has never been to rely entirely or mainly on the technicalities of the Regulations. The main criterion has always been whether or not a basement which is being considered for closure is reasonably fit for human habitation, with the Regulations as a useful technical adjunct. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS Owner/occupiers, owners of rented properties, and in some instances leaseholders, who desire to modernise their properties may receive a monetary grant from the local authority under the provisions of the House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959. There are two schemes under which application may be made for grant. The 'Discretionary' grant enables the Council to contribute up to half of the estimated cost of improvements which would enable a house to conform to a 12-point standard. This form of grant, as its name implies, is paid on the discretion of the local authority and is subject to a minimum payment of £50 and a maximum of £400. The 'Standard' grant, however, can be obtained by landlords of houses built prior to 1945 as a right. This form of grant is paid towards the cost of installing five basic amenities, namely - (1) a fixed bath or shower in a bathroom; (2) a wash-hand basin; (3) a water closet in or contiguous to the dwelling; (4) a hot water supply; (5) facilities for storing food. The 'Standard' grant can provide half the cost of the work involved up to a maximum of £155. All applications for Improvement Grants are submitted to the Borough Treasurer's Department, and then forwarded to the Health Department for inspection of the premises to be made to determine that the proposed works will satisfy the requirements of the standards specified in the Act. -33- In 1961 167 applications for 'Discretionary' grants, and 26 applications for 'Standard' grants were received, inspected and reported upon, and were subsequently authorised by the Council to receive grant payment,, An additional 127 visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to advise owners or builders concerning proposed improvement schemes. In the case of 'Standard' grant applications the premises are also inspected when the work of improvement has been completed, to ensure that the necessary work has been carried out satisfactorily before payment is made. RENT ACT, 1957 - CERTIFICATES OF DISREPAIR The following applications for various Certificates under the provisions of the Rent Act were dealt with during the year:- Applications for Certificates of Disrepair 13 Notices to landlords of the Council's intention to issue a Certificate of Disrepair 14 Certificates of Disrepair issued 4 Undertakings received from landlords, and accepted by the Council 10 Works completed after issue of Notices to landlords of the Council's intention to issue a Certificate of Disrepair 2 Applications for Cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair 9 Certificates of Disrepair cancelled without objections 5 Applications for Cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair refused 4 Applications from landlords for Certificates as to the remedying of defects for which the landlord had previously given an undertaking 11 Certificates issued to landlords as to the remedying of defects for which the landlord had previously given an undertaking 11 Applications from tenants for Certificates as to the remedying of defects for which the landlord had previously given an undertaking 2 Certificates issued to tenants as to the remedying of defects for which the landlord had previously given an undertaking 2 -34- HOUSING PROGRESS The number of dwellings built in the Borough during the year was as under:- By the Borough Council 503 " the London County Council 702 " Private Enterprise 303 1,508 In addition, at the end of the year, the Borough Council had a further 701 dwellings under construction. During the year, considerable progress was made in the St. Mary's Comprehensive Development Area, particularly in the Samuel Street/Frances Street area, where three of the four l4-storey blocks of flats were completed. The first block was officially opened in May by Her Royal Highness The Princess Margaret, following which two of the flats were furnished and on view to the public. Widespread interest was aroused in these tower blocks, visits being made from all parts of the country. The flats are heated by electric underfloor heating supplemented by an electric panel fire. Laundry facilities are also provided. On another scheme comprising 71 dwellings in the Belson Road/ Kingsman Street area, progress was maintained, and during the year 47 flats were completed and families housed therein. The rehousing of families living in sub-standard properties in the Glyndon Area continues, and building works commenced in the autumn. This first stage of the redevelopment comprises some 252 dwellings and a parade of eight shops, and includes three 11-storey blocks of flats which will be heated by gas warm air. Here also communal laundry facilities will be available to the tenants. Rehousings have also taken place from the Kirkham Street Area, 20 families having been provided with alternative accommodation. At the same time negotiations are continuing for the acquisition of the properties in the area. Dwellings have also been completed and occupied on several sites in the Borough, in particular at Strongbow Crescent where a further 128 families were housed. During the year 78 families were rehoused from Temporary Dwellings in order to make the sites available -35- for permanent housing development, the Bostall Area continuing to have considerable attention in this manner. Preliminary negotiations were commenced during the year for the acquisition and development of several sites in the Borough, notably "The Oaks", Burrage Road, where it is proposed that a tower block should be constructed on the site of the present house, the wooded grounds, in the main, remaining in their existing natural condition. At the 31st December, 1961 there were 9,825 tenancies in properties owned or controlled by the Council, and at that date there were 2,772 applicants on the Housing Register, compared with 2,546 the previous year. The above information on the Housing Progress in the Borough has been kindly supplied by the Chief Housing Officer. HEALTH EDUCATION FIIM PROGRAMMES AND TAIKS A rise of 30 per cento in the number of visits over 1960 shows that once again interest in this effective method of health education increases. 116 visits were made during the year and the letters of appreciation received and points raised following the showing of programmes demonstrate that the information given is being absorbed. As in past years a number of new organisations were visited and the series of programmes proved popular. Average audience figures showed a slight decrease on the previous year, but individual audiences varied as usual from 25 to 300 according to the type of organisation visited. Old People's clubs continue to attract the largest audiences. Total attendances for the year approached 6,500, an increase of 26 per cent. over the 1960 figure. The range of subjects illustrated is wide, as can be seen from the following Table. Talks lasting about 20 minutes, and talks with films lasting about 60 minutes, showed an increase in demand, but sound film shows continue to be by far the most popular. Action and visual display together are still the most effective medium for education, and this is reflected in the annually increasing numbers of films available on all subjects. -36- Summary of the Work of the Health Education Unit TABLE I Subject No. of Sessions Talks Films Both Total Home Safety 1 18 2 21 Smoke Control - 7 - 7 Clean Water & Sanitation - 7 2 9 Infectious Disease &.

Posters of a topical nature were displayed on various sites and on the Department's transport. Much literature is distributed at visits by the Health Education Unit. The publication "Better Health" is distributed monthly to General Practitioners' surgeries and to factories. Included in this distribution are leaflets and posters on topical matters. Home Safety received increased attention and is dealt with more fully below. The Council's activities in Smoke Control are given wide publicity, and this is more fully dealt with on Page 46 of this Report. -37- FOULING BY DOGS: WARNING NOTICES These notices, which were first introduced in 1959, have proved most popular. In response to several more requests for their display a further supply was obtained and are now on display. The practice is to fix the notices to lamp-posts in areas where complaints are received, subsequently moving them to other areas when it is felt that the warning has been fully noted. There are indications that their display in an area does materially reduce the nuisance caused by offences of this nature. ACCIDENTS IN THE HOME (a) Accident Rate in Woolwich As can be seen on Page 14 of this Report, 15 deaths occurred in Woolwich as a result of accidents at home or on holiday. The number of non-fatal accidents is not known due to the fact that injuries from this cause do not, as in Road Accidents, have to be reported to the Police. However, the London Ambulance Service records give some indication of the more serious accidents. In 1961, 468 cases (or 3.2 per 1,000 of the population) were removed to hospital as the result of a home accident in the Borough. The proportion of accidents occurring in the five main groups - falls, poisoning, burns and scalds, suffocation, and othersfollows closely the national averages falls accounting for over 75 per cent. of the cases. (b) Publicity-General Throughout the year the Department distributes material on this subject, through Council offices, visits by the Health Education Unit, circulation to local General Practitioners and factories, and displays in the Department. In addition, 5,000 copies of the booklet "Accidents in the Home" published by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, together with 5,000 miscellaneous leaflets on the same subject, were distributed to local organisations, especially those including pensioners amongst their members, in response to requests made by them. (c) Publicity-National During National Fire Prevention Week, and in the weeks following, publicity material was broadcast on as wide a front as -38- possible in order to bring to the attention of people in all walks of life the dangers of fire, and some elementary methods of reducing or preventing them. 800 shops and business premises in the Borough were asked to display a sticker issued by the Central Office of Information. A favourable response was noted. Posters were sent to many local organisations asking that they be displayed in as prominent a position as possible. With the co-operation of the Councils Public Relations Officer, posters were displayed at nearly 40 sites. Material and posters were sent to local General Practitioners and factories for display; those to factories included matter on industrial fire prevention. With the co-operation of the Borough Librarian, bookmarks were distributed at the four lending libraries in the Borough. Two displays were sited in the Health Department's offices. In addition, local Cinema Managers were asked if they would show a trailer on fire prevention. Of the six in the Borough three had already had arrangements made via their Head Offices, but two others agreed to show the film. Managers also offered to display posters and leaflets. In all, the material disseminated totalled 5,700 assorted leaflets; 5,000 book-marks; 1,340 posters and stickers; and 350 fire prevention codes. (d) Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme - Home Safety In response to a request from the Girl Guides Association, County of London, a course and examination for the first level of the above Award was arranged by the Department's staff. Instruction was given at three one-hour sessions, and included the use of flannelgraph, film strips and films. The average attendance at the lectures was twenty-five, and of the fifteen girls who decided to take the subsequent examinations, ten were successful. Due to the success of this pilot venture, arrangements were put in hand for further courses, including instruction up to the second level of the Award. It is hoped that many more Youth organisations will take part in these Home Safety courses. -39- CLEAN AIR SMOKE CONTROL AREAS Progress towards bringing the whole of the Borough under Smoke Control was continued during the year. Further Smoke Control Areas were declared, and at the end of 1961 there were eleven Areas in operation and a further five in various stages towards completion. The following Areas, details of which have been previously reported, are now in operation:- St. Mary's St. Mary's No. 2. St. Mary's No. 3. Abbey Wood Abbey Wood (Abbey Estate) Abbey Wood No. 2. Abbey Wood No. 3. Middle Park (North East) Middle Park (South West) Clothworkers Wood Coldharbour The following four Areas were declared during the year:- New Eltham Area This Area comprises 380 acres, and includes some 2,000 dwellings, of which 24 are Council properties, and the remainder private properties. Approximately 1,400 dwellings will require some 2,300 appliances, and a further 1,000 appliances will require adaptation. Operative date:- 1st October, 1962. Horn Park Area This Area comprises 454 acres, and includes approximately 2,400 dwellings, of which 1,045 are Council properties, and the remainder are private properties. Approximately 1,500 dwellings will require some 2,150 appliances, and a further 315 appliances will require adaptation. Operative date:- 1st December, 1962. Garrison North Area With the willing co-operation of the Garrison Authority -40- the inclusion of Army property under Smoke Control was commenced. This Area comprises 260 acres, and includes a substantial number of Garrison buildings, and the whole of the Married Quarters. Of the total of 350 premises, 349 are under the control of the Army. The works of conversion in Crown properties are being carried out by the Ministry of Works. The works do not attract grant aid. Operative date:- 1st October, 1962. Glyndon Area This Area forms the first phase of the Council's redevelopment scheme, and comprises six acres. It will consist of approximately 250 newly erected Borough Council dwellings. Therefore, no conversions are necessary. Operative date:- 1st October, 1962. NEW AREA In addition, work was commenced upon a further large Area to be known as the Eltham Smoke Control Area. It will comprise 1,550 acres and include 5,300 dwellings, of which 351 are Borough Council properties, 763 are London County Council properties and the remainder are private dwellings. There are over 300 shops. Approximately 2,900 dwellings will require some 4,300 fuel appliances, and a further 600 appliances will require adaptation. It is anticipated that the operative date will be 1st October, 1963. GENERAL At the end of the year there were 1,754 acres and 14,600 dwellings within operative Smoke Control Areas, and a further 2,650 acres and 9,475 dwellings within Areas being brought into operation. Details of the size and number of properties in these Areas, together with the proposed new Area, are set out in Table No. 12 and the accompanying map. In accordance with the requirements of the Minister of Housing and Local Government, the original estimate of cost for each Area has been based upon a 100% conversion rate. In the Abbey Wood No. 2 and Clothworkers Wood Areas, which came Into operation in 1960, it is estimated that after survey 2,139 private dwellings required 3,725 solid fuel appliances, and a further 304 dwellings required gas ignition to existing approved appliances. However, upon completion of the Areas it has been found that final costs have been considerably -41- -42- TABLE NO. 12 - SMOKE CONTROL AREAS Map Ref.

The following details show the various factors which gave rise to that reduction:- Abbey Wood No. 2 Smoke Control Area Clothworkers Wood Smoke Control Area Number of private properties requiring conversion 932 1,207 Total estimated cost £24,323 £30,486 Number of private properties in which conversion was carried out. 617 827 Total approved cost £11,644 £12,372 Total actual cost £14,005 £15,977 This represents a property conversion rate of - 66% 68% Only 302 (49%) in Abbey Wood No. 2, and 432 (52%) in Clothworkers Wood carried out the complete solid fuel conversion including gas ignition, for which grant was available. The remainder carried out a variety of works as follows:- (l) Complete solid fuel conversion without gas ignition 114 135 (2) Part solid fuel conversion with gas ignition 59 99 (3) Part solid fuel conversion without gas ignition 62 66 (4) Part solid fuel conversion with gas ignition and part without gas ignition 1 2 (5) Part solid fuel conversion with gas ignition and part electricity 7 4 (6) Part solid fuel conversion without gas ignition and part electricity 5 3 (7) Part solid fuel conversion with gas ignition and part gas fire 20 28 (8) Part solid fuel conversion without gas ignition and part gas fire 2 1 (9) Complete conversion by gas fires 7 13 -43-  Abbey Wood No. 2 Smoke Control Area Clothworkers Wood Smoke Control Area (10) Part conversion by gas fires 20 20 (11) Part conversion by gas fire, and part by electric fire. 1 1 (12) Complete conversion by electricity 6 10 (13) Part conversion by electricity 11 13 Many of those residents who carried out conversion types (1) - (4) above incurred slightly more expenditure than was considered reasonably necessary. Generally this was due to the appliances costing more than £5.0.0. and the renewal of defective but standard firebacks and surrounds. The residents who carried out conversion types (5) - (13) above, generally incurred considerably more expenditure than was reasonably necessary. Thus, whilst the total approved expenditure in these Areas was considerably less than the estimated cost, it gave rise to further expenditure by residents of £2,500 for Abbey Wood No. 2, and £5,600 for Clothworkers Wood, which did not rank for grant. PROCEDURE As previously reported, the Minister of Housing and Local Government has been considering the adoption of a simple administrative procedure to enable local authorities to obtain preliminary approval to the setting up of Smoke Control Areas. The Minister decided, early in the year, that in view of the considerable experience which had been gained by local authorities in the operation of Smoke Control Areas, the requirement that proposals for new Areas should be referred to him for preliminary approval before the Orders were formally submitted for his confirmation could be waived. He stressed the importance of early consultation with the appropriate Regional Fuel Advisory Committee regarding supplies of Smokeless fuels. This consultation now replaces the preliminary approval. -44- GRANTS The Council supported the further representations of the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee to the Minister that grants towards the cost of conversions should not be restricted only to work carried out after an Order has been confirmed. It was felt that in the general interests of clean air grants should be payable before this date, especially where a local authority has prepared a scheme for covering an area with a Smoke Control Order and where the particular conversion or replacement is carried out under the supervision of the local authority. APPLIANCES During the year the Ministry of Housing and Local Government expressed the view that as with solid fuel approved appliances, where the Council had an agreed limit of £5,0.0., a reasonable limit should be placed upon the cost of electrical and gas appliances. The Council agreed that the maximum cost of these fires ranking for grant would be limited to £14.0.0. and £12.0.0. respectively, subject to the full grant not being more than seven-tenths of a reasonable solid fuel conversion or seven-tenths of a reasonable electrical or gas conversion, whichever was the less. HARDSHIP CASES The Clean Air Act gives the Council discretion to pay greater than seven-tenths grant where it considers this to be reasonable. To cover cases of financial hardship, the Council decided to pay the whole cost of reasonable works in the ease of owner/occupiers who were Retirement Pensioners and who were also receiving National Assistance, Twenty-five such payments were made during the year. Twelve payments were made in respect of Retirement Pensioners who although eligible for National Assistance were not applying for It. In addition, the Council met the whole cost of reasonable works in two special cases where the applicants, although not of pensionable age, were in receipt of National Assistance. CHURCHES, VOLUNTARY AIDED SCHOOLS, ETC. The Council has discretion to pay such grant as it thinks fit in respect of conversions In Churches, Church Halls, Voluntary Aided Schools, etc. Following a recommendation of the Metropolitan -45- Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee, the Council agreed to contribute 30 per cent. of the reasonable cost and to give consideration to any representations Church or School Authorities may wish to make for greater payment in a particular case. During the year one payment amounting to 30 per cent. of the reasonable cost was made in respect of a Voluntary Aided School. MEANS OF IGNITION The Council has given every encouragement to the installation of gas ignition as the easiest means of lighting solid smokeless fuel. However, in some cases the cost of the installation of a gas supply is prohibitive. During the year the Minister, by Circular, agreed to allow grant upon an electric fire-lighter, produced by a well-known Company. This alternative means of ignition has proved to be most useful to those residents in some of the Smoke Control Areas where their properties are not carcased for gas. It is understood that the running costs of the two methods are comparable. FUEL SUPPLIERS The local supply of proprietary or "premium" smokeless fuels continues to improve. There are now several brands from which a choice can be made, and no complaints have been received from residents in Smoke Control Areas of inability to obtain authorised fuel. Nevertheless, the Council continues to advise residents not to place reliance upon any one of these fuels by insisting upon the delivery of only one brand. The supply of coke continues to be plentiful throughout the area. Only three instances were reported of the delivery of house coal in a Smoke Control Area, and following discussion with the retailer concerned authorised fuel was substituted. Careful watch is maintained by the Council's Inspectors for the emission of smoke in the operative Smoke Control Areas, and I am pleased to report that no serious infringements have been observed. PUBLICITY The Council continues to ensure that their Smoke Control activities are given adequate publicity. The notification by letters and booklets to residents, introduced when the Clean Air -46- Act was first operated, continues to be successful. There has been a minimum of upheaval and inconvenience to residents and no complaints have been received. Following confirmation of the Orders by the Minister, Public Meetings were held in respect of the New Eltham and Horn Park Areas. Both meetings were well attended and many questions were asked by residents, indicating the interest shown in the Council's Clean Air activities. The demonstration caravan was in use in each of these Areas, and stayed at least a week on different sites. Many residents visited the unit to inspect the three approved solid fuel appliances installed burning coke. It was staffed by the Health Department staff, A representative selection of appliances and fuels available is also displayed in the Department's waiting room. NEW FURNACES Section 3 of the Clean Air Act requires that new furnaces not used mainly for domestic purposes and exceeding a capacity of 55,000 B.T.U's shall, as far as practicable, be smokeless. Any person installing such a furnace must give prior notice to the Council and may submit detailed plans and specifications for the Council's approval before the work of installation takes place. During 1960 one application for prior approval was received in respect of the installation of a new boilerhouse at a local College. In addition, two notifications were received of proposals to alter boiler plant with a maximum rating of less than 55,000 B.T.U's. CLEAN AIR MEASURING STATIONS At the request of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Council in 1953 installed at each of five sites In the Borough a deposit gauge and lead peroxide candle for the measurement of atmospheric pollution. These Instruments gave useful local information, and this Information has been incorporated in the national figures collated by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In 1957, new daily volumetric apparatus was installed on three additional sites. This new apparatus has proved easier to work, is more accurate, and the analyses can be made within the Department. Experience has shown that the advantages of the daily volumetric -47- apparatus far outweigh those of the older instruments, and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research reported earlier this year that, except for special local purposes, the deposit gauge and lead peroxide candle should be regarded as obsolete and the findings from these instruments were no longer needed by that Department. The Council, therefore, decided from July to discontinue the use of the deposit gauge and lead peroxide candle, and during July and August daily volumetric apparatus was installed at a further nine stations, making a total of 12 such sites operating in the Borough. The following Table shows details of the average monthly measurements from August, of smoke and sulphur dioxide from these stations. TABLE NO. 13 STATION Smoke Concentration Microgrammes per cu.m.

INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD PREMISES WHERE FOOD IS PREPARED OR OFFERED FOR SALE A total of 1,320 inspections of food premises other than the daily market inspections was carried out by the Food Inspectors during the year. Inspections of registered food premises during the year were as follows:- Markets - Daily; Dairy visits 8; Distributors of Milk 55; Ice-cream Premises 308; Premises where Meat is Potted, Pickled, Pressed and Preserved 60; Premises where Sausages are Manufactured 63; Premises where Fish is Cured or prepared for Frying 37; Wholesale dealer in Margarine 2; 49 Restaurants, Cafes and Snack Bars 358; Industrial and School Meals Service Canteens 165; Bakehouses 3; Itinerant Vendors 6; Non-Registered Premises 132; Greengrocery and Fish Shops 92; Public Houses 51. MUX SUPPLY From the beginning of the year the part of the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960 dealing with Dealers' licences was in force. The Regulations introduced a combined pre-packed licence to permit the sale of "Pasteurised", "Sterilised" and "Tuberculin Tested" milk where the milk is obtained by the dealer in the container in which it is to be sold to the consumer. Dealers' licences granted in respect of premises at or from which milk is to be pasteurised, sterilised, or sold, permit sales outside as well as inside the area of the licensing authority who issued the licence,thereby dispensing with 'supplementary' licences. All licences issued by a Food and Drugs authority now last for five years. One Dealers Steriliser's licence, and one Dealers Pasteuriser's licence were issued in respect of the Dairy in the Borough, and 59 pre-packed licences authorising the use of the special designations "Pasteurised", "Sterilised" and "Tuberculin Tested" milk; nine prepacked licences authorising the use of "Sterilised" and "Pasteurised" milk; and 56 pre-packed licences authorising the use of "Sterilised" milk only, were issued in respect of the 124 registered Distributors of Milk in the Borough. The percentage of fat content of milk samples submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical analysis during the year was as follows:- No. of Samples 4.5 per cent. and over 3 4 per cent. and under 4.5 per cent. 4 3.5 per cent. and under 4 per cent. 92 3 per cent. and under 3.5 per cent. 63 Below 3 per cent. Nil 162 50 In the course of the year 191 samples of Pasteurised or Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised milk were submitted to the Park Hospital Laboratory, Hither Green, to assess the keeping quality of the milk by means of the Methylene Blue Test. Twenty of the samples submitted, however, could not be tested as the shade temperature exceeded 65ºF, but the remaining 171 samples all passed the test satisfactorily. To determine the adequacy of pasteurisation, 197 samples of Pasteurised or Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised milk were submitted to the Laboratory for the Phosphatase test. All the samples tested were reported as satisfactory. Satisfactory reports were also received on all the 22 samples of Sterilised milk or Tuberculin Tested Sterilised milk which were subjected to the Turbidity Test at the Park Hospital Laboratory. All the tests referred to above are now contained in the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1960. The long standing practice of taking samples of milk in the course of delivery to hospitals, schools, and institutions in the early hours of the morning was continued. Sixteen samples of milk so taken were submitted for chemical analysis to the Public Analyst, and a further 13 samples were submitted to the Park Hospital Laboratory for Phosphatase and Methylene Blue tests. Periodical visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to the premises from which milk is distributed. The standard of cleanliness and arrangements for the distribution of milk were found to be satisfactory. ICE-CREAM By the end of the year there were 335 registered Ice-cream premises in the Borough. The great majority of dealers sell only pre-packed ice-cream, but there acre, however, four premises which are also registered for the manufacture of ice-cream, and four registered for the storage of ice-cream. Before a dealer wishing to sell ice-cream can be registered by the Council the premises are first inspected to ensure they are suitable, and the Proprietor must comply with the requirements relating to ice-cream contained in the Heat Treatment Regulations. Regular inspections are made of all the premises where icecream is sold, manufactured, or stored, and during the year two 51 informal Notices were served on the Proprietors of ice-cream premises to remedy the four defects found. During the year 26 samples of ice-cream were taken to the Laboratory for grading by the Methylene Blue test, and all proved satisfactory. PUBLIC HOUSES There are in all 135 Public Houses in the Borough, and of these 30 serve main meals. Regular inspections are carried out at all the Public Houses to ensure that the requirements of the Food Hygiene Regulations are being observed. A very good standard of hygiene was maintained throughout the year, and in only one instance was it necessary to serve a formal Notice to secure the remedying of defects found. COMPLAINTS OF UNSOUND FOOD In addition to the time spent by the Council's Food Inspectors on the routine inspection of a large number of food premises in the Borough, detailed enquiries were made in respect of complaints received of foreign matter and other abnormalities in food. All the complaints of unsound food received were fully investigated by the Food Inspectors, and where Justified, appropriate action was taken with the producers. Several of the articles of food complained of were found to be genuine. The Council instituted legal proceedings against a Dairy Company in respect of a bottle of pasteurised milk which was found to contain black particles. Some foreign matter, probably mould, was found floating in the milk and adhering to the inner wall of the bottle. The firm were fined £7.0.0., with £3.3.0. costs. A fine of £10.0.0., with £3.3.0. costs was awarded by the Court against the manufacturers of a Steak and Kidney pie containing mould. The Council also prosecuted the manufacturers of meat puddings found to contain mould, the firm being fined £7.0.0., with £2.2.0. costs. A complaint was also received from a Woolwich housewife that a half-pint bottle of milk supplied to her contained mould growth. 52 The Council referred this complaint to a neighbouring Local Authority in whose area the milk had been bottled, and the Authority concerned instituted proceedings, the defendant Company being fined £2.0.0., with £1.1.0 costs. The Council's Health Committee also considered reports of other complaints of alleged unsound food. Warning letters were sent to a local baker following a complaint that a small beetle had been found in a bread roll baked at his premises. The importers of canned fish containing flies were also warned, as were the bakers of a loaf of bread containing pieces of woodc Thirty-six other complaints of unsound food were received from local residents during the year. Most of these complaints alleged unfitness of bread, milk, and meat pies. Fifteen of these complaints were of mould. A small piece of paper which had been baked in a loaf of bread was found to be a 'yeast' wrapper. Discolouration in another white loaf was caused by the accidental use of brown dough. The Food Inspector also advised the bakeries concerned in two other cases concerning mould and dirt in bread. FOOD SAMPLING, 1961 During the year ended 31st December, 1961, 896 samples of food and drugs (being 724 informal and 172 formal samples) were submitted for analysis by the Public Analyst, Of these, 29 informal samples were reported to be adulterated or otherwise not complying with the statutory requirements, giving a percentage of 3.2, compared with 2.6 in 1960. No private samples were examined during the year. Adverse reports were received on the following samples:- TABLE NO. 14 Sample No. Article Formal or Informal (F or I) Adulteration or Irregularity. 735 Angelica I No statement of ingredients on the label. 759 Cochineal Colouring Matter I Contained glycerine and isopropyl alcohol not disclosed on the label. -53- 697 Canned Vienna Sausage I Misleading label.

MEAT INSPECTION The total number of animals slaughtered and inspected at the Garland Road Abattoir during the year was 67,575. Details are as follows:- 55 TABLE NO. 15 CARCASES & OFFAL INSPECTED AND CONDEMNED IN WHOLE OR IN PART, 1961 Cattle excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Number killed and inspected. 11,835 90 6,688 23,703 25,259 All diseases (except Tuberculosis and Cysticerci)- Whole carcases condemned — — 19 7 38 Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 4,265 39 32 890 6,600 Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than Tuberculosis and Cysticerci 36 43.33 .47 3.33 22.17 Tuberculosis only- Whole carcases condemned 1 1 — — — Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 165 2 — — 216 Percentage of the number inspected affected with Tuberculosis 1.39 2.2 — — .79 Cysticercosis- Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned and treated by refrigeration. 134 — — — — 56 PREVALENCE AN D CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE The following diseases are compulsorily notifiable in the Borough:- Anthrax, Cholera, Diphtheria, Dysentery, Encephalitis (Acute), Erysipelas, Enteric Fever, Food Poisoning, Leprosy, Malaria, Measles, Membranous Croup, Meningococcal Infection, Ophthalmia Neonatorum, Pneumonia (Acute Primary), Pneumonia (Acute Influenzal), Poliomyelitis, Polio-encephalitis, Plague,Puerperal Pyrexia, Relapsing Fever, Scabies, Scarlet Fever (or Scarlatina), Smallpox, Tuberculosis (all forms), Typhoid Fever (including Paratyphoid), Typhus Fever, Whooping Cough, and Zymotic Enteritis. Cases of infectious disease notified to the Department are immediately visited by the Public Health Inspectors and disinfection is carried out wherever applicable. Where the patient is nursed at home, the Inspectors see that home isolation continues satisfactorily, and at the end of the infectious period, where necessary, the bedding belonging to the patient is removed for treatment at the Disinfecting Station and the rooms sealed and fumigated. A total of 3,352 cases of infectious diseases was notified during the year, being an increase of 3,012 on the previous year. 175 cases were removed to hospital. The increase In the incidence of infectious disease in the Borough was largely due to the fact that there were 3,057 cases of Measles notified during 1961, compared with 19 in the previous year. POLIOMYELITIS The one confirmed case of Poliomyelitis related to a boy aged four years, who was immediately removed to hospital on being suspected. He was confirmed as a case of Paralytic Poliomyelitis. Six other suspected cases were also treated in hospital, but all proved not to be Poliomyelitis, the revised diagnoses being Meningitis (two cases); Tonsillitis, Influenza, Measles, and Stomach pains. 57 DIPHTHERIA I am pleased to report once again that no confirmed case of Diphtheria occurred in the Borough during the year. Of the six suspected cases which were removed to hospital for observation, three were Glandular Fever, two Tonsillitis; and the sixth patient was a woman who was thought to be a Diphtheria carrier, but all throat and nose swabs proved negative. FOOD POISONING There were no reported outbreaks of Food Poisoning during the year. Altogether there were 13 notified cases, but only three single cases were confirmed, the causal organisms being identified as Salmonella Typhimurium in two patients, and one of Enteritidis (Jena variety). In one case where the illness was fairly severe, pease pudding purchased from a butcher's store outside the Borough and which had been served by the Assistant in greaseproof paper and then wrapped in newspaper, was the food suspected. Unfortunately, it was not possible to obtain specimens of this food for examination,, Jellied eels were suspected in the second case of Salmonella Typhimurium, but owing to the delay in the patient seeing his Doctor it was not possible for the Department to make a full investigation. DYSENTERY Of the 31 cases originally notified, ten were subsequently confirmed and found to be cases of Sonne Dysentery. Three of the confirmed cases were in hospital, and a further seven suspected cases were removed to hospital. Numerous specimens were taken, and the positive cases were excluded from work or school as appropriate under the care of their own Doctors until at least two consecutive negative specimens had been produced. Sixteen of the individual suspected cases were residents at the Plumstead Rest Centre, and ten of these were later confirmed as suffering from Measles. The majority of the non-confirmed cases, which mainly concerned two or three members of several different families, were found to have Gastro Enteritis. 58 MEASIiSS The number of individual cases of Measles notified during 1961 totalled 3,057, of which 40 patients were treated in hospital for various complications. All except 25 of the notified cases were under the age of 15 years. The County Council Health Visitors visited a large number of the children notified. PUERPERAL PYREXIA Of the 88 notified cases of Puerperal Pyrexia occurring in the Borough, 32 of the patients were not Woolwich mothers.

Dr. Morgan writes:- "In 1961 a total of 15,619 examinations were carried put in the Borough of Woolwich, and 22 cases of tuberculosis requiring close supervision or treatment were discovered. The figures show an increase in the number of patients referred by general practitioners to the regular sessions in Beresford Square from 208 to 233, and among these patients were found two cases of significant tuberculosis, and four of primary lung cancer. A summary of examinations and significant tuberculous cases follows:- 61  MEN WOMEN Number x-rayed No. of cases requiring close supervision or treatment. Number x-rayed No. of cases requiring close supervision or treatment. Regular site at Beresford Square 3,094 10 1,242 2 Firms and factories 4,893 6 1,615 1 Hospitals,colleges, etc. 464 — 1,092 1 Eltham Public survey 1,300 2 1,919 1 TOTALS: 9,751 18 5,868 4 The total number of examinations during 1961, namely 15,619, included approximately 2,500 repeat examinations of men over 45 x-rayed in connection with the six-monthly service for the early detection of lung cancer. The adjusted incidence of tuberculosis is therefore as follows: MEN (7,251 individuals examined and 18 cases found) 2.5 per thousand. WOMEN (5,868 individuals examined and 4 cases found) 0.7 per thousand. TOTAL: (13,119 Individuals examined and 22 cases found) 1.7 per thousand. Of the total of 22 cases of tuberculosis requiring close supervision or treatment, 13 were found among those who had not been x-rayed within the last five years; and of the 12 cases discovered at the Beresford Square sessions as many as nine had again not been examined within the last five years. These findings clearly demonstrate the fact that those whose previous x-ray was taken more them five years ago, and those who have never been examined, must somehow be persuaded to attend at Mass X-ray Units. 62 Lung Cancer - Seven cases of primary lung cancer were discovered during the year, four of which had been referred by General Practitioners. Other Non-Tuberculous Abnormalities included the following: Men Women Total Suspected carcinoma of bronchus - 1 1 Carcinoma of breast - 1 1 Sarcoidosis - 2 2 Chondroma of bronchus 1 - 1 Hamartoma 1 - 1 Pneumonitis - 7 16 Bronchiectasis - 2 7 Chronic bronchitis and emphysema 7 - 7 Bullous emphysema - - 2 Fibrosis of lung 1 1 2 Emphysema and pleural thickening - 1 4 Bronchial ademona of carinoid type - 1 1 Neuro-fibroma matosis 1 - 1 Pleuro-pericardial cyst 1 1 2 Para-oesophageal cyst - 1 1 Raised diaphragm - 1 1 Hiatus hernia - 1 1 Retro-sternal goitre 1 1 2 Fractured clavicle 1 - 1 Fractured rib 2 - 2 Adhesions left base - 1 1 Metallic foreign body - 1 1 35 23 58 I would like again to express my gratitude to the Borough Council and its staff; to the Police and all the many others who have helped us so much in our attempts to diagnose chest disease in the early stages. We look forward to a gradual increase in the numbers attending our fortnightly visits to Beresford Square, and we hope to plan a major survey in the Borough of Woolwich in the near future." DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION Following notification of infectious disease 123 rooms, occupied by persons suffering from these diseases were disinfected by the staff of the Department. Of that total 72 rooms had been occupied by tuberculous patients. 63 The Public Health Inspectors carried out nearly fifteen hundred visits in connexion with verminous conditions, and as a result 362 rooms were disinfested of vermin. Many requests were received from residents wishing to dispose of old, unwanted furniture or furnishings. Often the unwanted articles to be destroyed were dirty or verminous, and in the majority of cases were formerly owned by old people who had died. The items which were collected and destroyed at the Council's Destructor included- 18 sets of bedding 20 items of furniture 12 bedsteads 9 mattresses Quantity of clothing. A local firm dealing in rag and other waste material wipers requested the issue of Certificates of Hygiene to the effect that the wipers, to be shipped abroad, had been properly sterilised, and washed. Six Certificates of Hygiene were issued to the firm concerned during 1961, for which small charges were made. AUTHENTICATION OF CERTIFICATES OF VACCINATION Persons proceeding abroad are required to produce in certain countries evidence of recent successful vaccination or inoculation. The signatures on these Certificates are not acceptable by the countries concerned unless authenticated by the Medical Officer of Health as being the bona fide signature of a Doctor practising within the area. During 1961, 537 Certificates were authenticated by me; 492 related to protection against Smallpox, 21 for Cholera, and 14 for T.A.B. inoculation. PERSONAL CLEANSING The Borough Council maintains two personal Cleansing Stations, one being at Plumstead (adjoining the Turkish Baths in Plumstead High Street), and the other at the Lionel Road Centre, Eltham. 64 LABORATOR Y FACILITIES A large part of the Council's pathological and allied work in relation to the diagnosis, prevention and control of infectious diseases is undertaken at the Southern Group Laboratory at the Hither Green Hospital, Lewisham. This service is provided by the Public Health Laboratory Service. Specimens sent to this Laboratory include samples of milk and ice-cream, samples of food in suspected food poisoning cases, specimens of meat from the Abattoir, and samples of swimming bath water. The following summary relates to the work carried out by the Laboratory on behalf of the Council during 1961:- Type of Specimen No. Examined Food (various) 5 Ice-cream (Methylene Blue test) 16 Milk (Statutory tests on Pasteurised, Sterilised and T.T. milks) 409 Water (from swimming baths, paddling and boating pools) 38 Organs from Animal Carcases (Sections) 9 Pigeons' faeces (for Salmonella) 8 485 The examination of specimens of human origin (mainly swab examinations) for the general practitioners in the Borough, and also specimens referred to the Hospital from local clinics, is undertaken by the Woolwich Group Hospital Management Committee at the Brook Hospital and at the St. Nicholas Hospital. -65- TABLE OF CONTENTS Page Preface 2 Health Committee 4 Staff 4 General Statistics 6 Vital Statistics 7 Public Health Administration 15 Old People's Welfare 27 Housing 30 Health Education 36 Clean Air 40 Inspection and Supervision of Food 49 Infectious Diseases (including Disinfection, Disinfestation and Personal Cleansing) 57 Laboratory Facilities 65
