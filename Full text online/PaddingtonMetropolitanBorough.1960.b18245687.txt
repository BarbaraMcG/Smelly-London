Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1960, in accordance with Regulations 5 (3) and 15 (5) of the Public Health Officers' Regulations, 1959. (1) Vital Statistics The Infant Mortality Rate (total infant deaths per 1,000 total live births) shews a slight increase over last year (26 cf. 22 in 1959). It is however the continued high Perinatal Mortality Rate (stillbirths and deaths under one week per 1,000 total live births) of 35 which gives cause for concern. During the last decade the perinatal rate has remained almost stationary throughout the whole country. About one-third of these deaths are due to prematurity, which indicates the importance of still further efforts to reduce the loss of infant life from this cause. During the last three years we have received notifications of 8 deaths from pregnancy, childbirth and abortion. It is grievous to record that 5 of the 8 deaths were occasioned by abortion. (2) Infectious Disease The incidence of infectious disease in the Borough again remained low throughout the year. In this context I must refer to the highly successful immunisation campaign conducted by the London County Council covering Diphtheria, Poliomyelitis, Smallpox, Whooping Cough and Tetanus. The figures relating to inoculations carried out during the year among Paddington residents are contained in the body of the report. The only infectious disease to which 1 should draw your special attention is the notification of 138 cases of Puerperal Pyrexia. This is because of the concentration of the maternity beds for the area in the Borough of Paddington. Indeed, only 62 of the 138 cases notified were Paddington residents. (3) Staff In 1957 the Public Health Committee agreed that, as a result of the serious shortage of Public Health Inspectors, a scheme should be inaugurated whereby students should be appointed and opportunities afforded them for training as Public Health Inspectors. Accordingly, four trainees were appointed. Miss A. Gallimore, Messrs. K. G. Mahers, R. C. Morton and J. W. Starr. At the time of writing, I am very pleased to record that all these students have now, not only qualified as Public Health Inspectors, but have also subsequently passed the Meat and Other Foods examination. This is a particularly gratifying achievement as the examinations are most searching, with a pass list of only about 50 per cent. Unfortunately the inspectorate is still four below the establishment with consequential repercussions on the work of the department. Three other students have been added to the staff, and I hope in due course they will qualify as Public Health Inspectors. 4 (4) Appointment of Welfare Officer In July, 1959, the Council decided to appoint a Welfare Officer on the staff of the Public Health Department, and in December, 1959, Miss Harrison commenced her duties. In the Appendix I have included Miss Harrison's report on the completion of her first year's work, which covers a wide social field and is of great interest and importance. (5) Overcrowding Unfortunately a serious degree of overcrowding still exists in this Borough. Although on the register of overcrowding there were records of 167 cases at the end of the year, we are only too well aware that many other cases exist which have not come, so far, to our notice. The main reason for this is that Paddington attracts many immigrants from overseas in search of employment. On arrival they obtain perhaps a furnished single room accommodation, and in due course are joined by the rest of their family. All serious cases of overcrowding coming to our notice are reported in detail to the Public Health Committee, who consider carefully all facets of the problems presented to them. (6) Home Bathing of the Elderly Reference is made in my Report to the inauguration of a new scheme, on the 1st April, 1961, which will greatly relieve the excellent and over-burdened nurses of the Paddington and St. Marylebone District Nursing Association. It has been agreed that a special appointment be made to this department in order to undertake the home bed bathing of certain patients of the District Nursing Association. This will of course result in the release of nurses to deal with cases urgently requiring their nursing skill and attention. If the scheme proves successful I feel this venture will merit the attention of other local authorities. (7) Conclusion I would like to express my gratitude for the help and co-operation I have received from the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee, the Chief Officers of the Council, and especially to all the staff of the Public Health Department. I have the honour to be Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H. LESLIE OLDERSHAW, Medical Officer of Health. Public Health Department, 14-15, Park Place Villas, London, W.2. Tel.

FACTORIES.—The Public Health Inspectors made 450 (491) visits to factories during the year. Further details of their work in this connection are given in the annex of this Report. OUTWORKERS.—The Public Health Inspector concerned visits all notified outworkers to ensure that the premises are suitable for the type of work carried out. During the year the inspector made 262 (100) visits and all the premises were found to be satisfactory. Further details will be found in the annex of this Report.

Westbourne Ward Order. The preliminary survey is being carried out. Installation of furnaces.—The following figures relate to industrial furnaces, or domestic furnaces with a capacity of 55,000 or more B.T.Us. per hour, which must be notified under the Clean Air Act.

Two block control schemes were carried out and the sewers in the Borough were treated twice during the year. HOUSEBOATS.—In my Report for 1959 I referred to the increasing number of houseboats on the stretch of the Grand Union canal in Paddington and the steps being taken by the British Waterways Authority to provide toilet facilities ashore for the residents. In October, 1960, lavatory blocks for the boats at the Blomfield Road and Paddington Basin moorings were completed. These consist of flush toilets for men and women and means for the disposal of the contents of Elsan type closets. Keys to these blocks were handed to the houseboat residents by the Waterways Authority, and advice on the effective sealing off or removal of the flush toilets aboard the boats was given by the Canal Boats Inspector. Further visits were made to the houseboats a month later and the flush toilets aboard were all found to be out of use and the new arrangements working satisfactorily. CARE OF THE AGED. (i) Home bathing.—As the Committee are aware home bathing services are provided for both men and women by the Cleansing Station Staff of the department. 25 In this connection the District Nursing Association, who carry out a similar service for the aged of both sexes, approached the Public Health Committee in October asking for assistance in this direction. Owing to shortage of nursing staff difficulty was being experienced in coping with the number of bathing cases on their books, and furthermore the services of the nursing staff thus engaged could be devoted to cases where their nursing qualifications could be more advantageously used. The number of cases involved amounts to approximately twenty a week. The Public Health Committee agreed to provide this assistance and made provision therefor in the estimates for 1961/1962 for the appointment of one additional (female) employee to cope with this extension of our present home bathing services. The District Nursing Association are deeply appreciative of the Council's co-operation which, while not affecting the persons who were receiving this service perhaps more important still, thus released nurses to deal with cases requiring expert nursing attention Eight hundred and sixty-five (694) baths were given at home to thirty-nine (36) persons during the year. (ii) Laundering of linen.—The need for this type of service for the elderly is growing. It is difficult to assess for future increase, but in order to meet such eventuality the Committee have approved an arrangement whereby St. Pancras Borough Council have agreed to assist by accepting any cases we are unable to deal with at any time at a cost of 10s. 0d. per case. I should like to place on record my appreciation of the ready co-operation extended to us by the St. Pancras Borough Council. The number of cases being dealt with at the end of the year by the laundry service was twenty-one (15). Thirty-eight (36) people received help from the laundry service during the year. (iii) Holiday Home.—The Council's Holiday Home at Bexhillon-Sea again proved very popular and the following figures show the guests who were accommodated at "Kincardine." Guests stay for a fortnight during January, February, March and November and for a week during the remainder of the year. Number of applications received 991 Number of guests accommodated 615 Applicants refusing a holiday— Date offered unacceptable 64 Private reasons 95 Illness 84 Death of applicant, friend or relative 20 Applicants not offered a holiday— Removed from Borough 5 Died 8 Single room not available 1 Dates required not available 3 Applicant not fit 3 Priority not reached 93 Of the 615 guests accommodated, 203 were having their first holiday at the Home. At Christmas a further sixteen guests (the maximum which can be catered for) were selected from twenty-seven applicants and spent a week at the Home over the holiday period. 26 (iv) Invalid meals.—Invalid meals for London is an Association maintained by grants and voluntary subscriptions and is a specialist service not to be confused with the Meals-on-Wheels service provided by the Women's Voluntary Service or Salvation Army. Apart from special meals for invalids the Association has developed a service for elderly people, particularly for those who live alone and are so frail that they are unable to cater for themselves. The service is limited but approximately forty meals a day for five days a week are provided to Paddington residents at a charge of 1s. 4d. for retirement pensioners or 1s. 8d. for those under pensionable age but in receipt of National Assistance. The full cost of a meal is 2s. 6d. Meals are supplied only on a medical recommendation. (v) National Assistance Acts.—Unhappily it was found necessary to apply to the Court for the compulsory removal to hospital of one person during the year. She was a spinster aged over 80 years living alone in two rooms which were very dirty and verminous; and when she became ill she refused to enter a hospital. A first Order for three weeks' detention was followed by a second Order for a further month and during this time her rooms were cleaned and disinfested. The patient recovered during her stay in hospital and was discharged home and is under the constant supervision and help of this department. (vi) General.—At the end of the year there were 314 (243) names on the register maintained in the Department of old people who are visited regularly. In addition, 57 (177) other elderly persons were visited but it was not found necessary to place them on the register. The two Visitors made 2,644 (2,635) visits and the Public Health Inspectors 19 (15) visits to old people during the year. WATER SUPPLY.—All drinking water in the Borough is supplied from the Metropolitan Water Board's mains and the Director of Water Examination (E. Windle Taylor, M.A., M.D., D.P.H.) has kindly supplied the following report and figures. The water supply to your area has been of satisfactory hygienic quality and adequate in quantity during the year 1960. It is derived from the non-tidal portion of the River Thames, stored in the Board's reservoirs in the Thames Valley and filtered and chlorinated at the Board's works at Ashford Common and Barn Elms. The water is not plumbo-solvent and there were no important extensions to mains nor changes in the general scheme of supply. The length of new mains laid in your Borough was only 176 yards. All repaired and new mains are disinfected with chlorine before being returned to service. Chemical Examination Number of samples 207 Ammonia nitrogen 0.024 Albuminoid nitrogen 0.082 Oxidised nitrogen (Nitrate) 4.0 Chlorides as C1 28 Oxygen abstracted from permanganate (four hours at 27 °C.) 1.22 Turbidity units 0.4 27 Colour—m.m. brown 2 ft.

Bacteriological Results (after treatment) Number of samples 1,778 Agar plate count per ml. (20-24 hours at 37 °C.) 14.4 Coliform count—per cent, samples negative in 100 ml 100 PUBLIC SWIMMING BATHS.—Water for the Baths in the Borough is supplied from the Metropolitan Water Board's mains. Apart from the routine tests mentioned below, samples of water from each Bath were submitted for chemical analysis and bacteriological examination by the Public Analyst in September. All the samples were reported to be satisfactory. The following details have kindly been supplied by the Manager of the Baths:— There are two Swimming Baths in the Borough (Porchester Baths and Kensal Road Baths) each establishment having a large and a small Bath. The large Baths are open from May to September and the small Baths are open all the year round. There were approximately 171,000 attendances during the year (116,000 at Porchester Baths and 55,000 at Kensal Road Baths). A high standard of purity of bath water is maintained by continuous flow through pressure type sand filters, the water being treated by coagulants to flocculate organic matter, and then chlorinated to a marginal chlorination standard of 0.2 to 0.5 parts per million. The alkalinity of the bath water is determined by the use of soda ash treatment and a pH value of 7.2 to 7.8 is maintained. Finally the water is aerated and reheated to 76°—78° F. Cleansing of the sand filters is brought about by a reversal of the flow of water to break up the solidified sand bed, assisted by rocking the filters and the use of steam/air agitation. The normal daily consumption of fresh water added to the bath following filter cleansing equals approximately one-twenty-fifth of the bath capacity. The swimming baths are completely emptied, cleaned and refilled once a year. 28 MASS X-RAY SURVEYS Dr. G. Z. Brett, the Physician-in-Charge, has kindly supplied the following details:— Number of people X-rayed in Paddington:— Men 3,706 Women 1,788 Total 5,494 Number of cases of (a) active tuberculosis— Men Nil Women 3 (b) tuberculosis requiring observation— Men 1 Women 2 (c) cancer of the lung found— Men 1 Women Nil Not all of these cases were Paddington residents, although they were found during 1960 in surveys carried out in the Borough.

There were 52 (55) basement dwellings on the Register. Of the cases of overcrowding relieved during the year 7 (16) were rehoused by the London County Council, 6 (2) were provided with accommodation by the Borough Council, 27 (28) secured accommodation privately and 15 (14) were relieved by a natural reduction in the size of the family or on obtaining additional accommodation. The practice of sending warning letters to owners against permitting the premises to become again overcrowded has been continued in all known cases where overcrowding has been abated. Section 80 of the Housing Act, 1957, gives a local authority power, where they are satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which make it expedient to do so, to allow the temporary use of a house by persons in excess of the permitted number. During the year the Council issued 1 (-) licence under this section. During the year a total of 275 Paddington families were rehoused by the London County Council and 190 by the Borough Council. Town Planning Three hundred and fifty-five (190) applications under the Town and Country Planning Acts for the conversion and alteration of premises, change of use or continuation of consent were referred to the Department for examination and comment. Houses Unfit for Human Habitation No. of basement rooms dealt with by closing orders 200 (312) No. of upper rooms closed 17 (24) No. of mews premises closed — (2) No. of houses dealt with by closing orders in lieu of demolition orders 1 (—) No. of houses dealt with by demolition orders or in respect of which undertakings were accepted — (—) Forty-five (65) persons were displaced as a result of the Council's operations. Closing Orders were determined or undertakings cancelled on 54 (79) basement rooms. Thirty-six (52) other basement rooms were made fit without recourse to formal proceedings. Of the 200 basement rooms and 17 upper rooms closed, 86 basement and 8 upper rooms were in premises de-requisitioned by the Council under the Requisitioned Houses and Housing (Amendment) Act, 1955. During the time that these rooms were under the Council's control they were considered to be unfit for housing purposes and were not so used. The Closing Orders were made to ensure that the position was maintained. New accommodation During the year the Council completed thirty new flats at Elmfield House (10), Ainsworth House (10) and Edward House (10). 30 Housing Accommodation—Preferential Treatment During the year 206 (218) medical certificates were referred to me by the Borough Director of Housing for "pointing." Points are awarded for certified ill-health, and if the applicant's health is affected by his living conditions the Public Health Department investigates these conditions and in many instances is able to get them remedied. Land Charges Act, 1952 Some 2,162 (2,190) enquiries on matters in connection with the registered statutory charges under this Act were dealt with by the Department during the year. RENT ACT, 1957.—Below is a table showing details of the applications during 1960 for certificates of disrepair under this Act together with the action taken thereon. Applications for certificates of disrepair— No. of applications for certificates 17 (21) No. of decisions not to issue certificates 1 (4) No. of decisions to issue certificates— (a) in respect of some but not all defects 9(11) (b) in respect of all defects 6 (7) No. of undertakings given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule 3 (8) No. of undertakings refused by Council under proviso to paragraph 5 of the First Schedule — (—) No. of certificates issued 12 (10) No. of applications awaiting report at end of year 1 (—) Applications for cancellation of certificates— Applications by landlords for cancellation of certificates 14 (23) Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates 10 (8) Decisions by Council to cancel in spite of tenants' objections 1 (2) Certificates cancelled by Council 5 (17) No. of applications awaiting report at end of year 1 (1) WELFARE OFFICER The close of 1960 marked the completion of a full year's work of Miss Harrison, Welfare Officer, and I felt it would not only be appropriate, but also informative if she submitted a report generally on the problems with which she has had to contend. Her report, which is to be found in the Appendix will, I am sure, give a fair picture of the problems which she has to face in her daily duties. SEWAGE.—The Ministry of Health have requested that this Report should indicate whether the arrangements for sewerage and sewage disposal in the district are reasonably adequate. I have consulted the Borough Engineer and Surveyor and we agree that sewage arrangements in Paddington are reasonably adequate. Exceptionally heavy storms in August and September caused some flooding in the Westbourne Grove/Queensway area and the Shirland Road/Saltram Crescent area due to the London County 31 Council sewers crossing the Borough becoming surcharged and unable to accept the discharge from the Borough Council sewers. This problem, of course, also affects other Boroughs and the County Council were supplied with full details to assist them in dealing with the problem. The disposal of sewage is a matter for which the London County Council are responsible. The sewage from Paddington goes to the Northern Outfall Works at Beckton. At these works the sewage is treated and separated into effluent pure enough to be discharged into the Thames, and sludge which is disposed of at sea. 32 APPENDIX Report of the Public Analyst (C. Harcourt Wordsworth, B.Sc.(Lond.), F.R.I.C.) for the year ended 31st December, 1960. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Paddington. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, During the year under review the number of samples submitted under the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, was again 600. Of these, nineteen were made the subject of special reports and most concerned complaints of food containing foreign substances which included a cigarette end, cloth, glass fragments, sand, cement, dust, paint and mould. Adverse reports were also issued upon other samples which were unsatisfactory. These were jam deficient in sugar, dried fruit salad in an infected condition and Glauber's Salt B.P., which was found to be anhydrous or free from the water naturally present in the true crystalline powder. The absence of this water made the drug too strong and although it might be encouraging to get more than was paid for, drugs are prescribed by dose and it is important that only those of correct strength shall be supplied. Most of the foods and drugs analysed were quite satisfactory, and it may be concluded that the wide variety of articles again sampled by your Inspector were of good general quality. It is worth recording that 273 samples of milk were taken and analysed, and although a few approached the minimum standards below which milk is presumed to be not genuine, none was found to have been either watered or skimmed. A summary of the samples analysed during the year is given below:— Formal Informal Total Drugs — 9 9 Meat and Meat Products — 10 10 Milk — 273 273 Other articles 308 308 — 600 600 In recent years there has been a great advance in the sale of pre-packed foods and careful watch is maintained on the style and wording of the labels and advertising matter connected with such articles. There are now many Food Standards specifying either the composition of the main ingredients of a food, or limiting the amounts of added preservatives or contaminating material which might have found its way into the finished product from, say, crop spraying residues. Quality of food is governed also by " Codes of Practice " issued as compositional food standards by the Ministry after discussions with the Trade. Although not having the full legal 33 powers granted by the Food and Drugs Act, these Codes provide a most useful measure by which the quality of food is maintained. Finally we have accepted trade standards maintained by the manufacturers. All these standards, some new, some of many years' standing, call for methods of analysis of known accuracy, and with the advance of knowledge, new methods are being devised continually to provide accurate checks upon the nature and composition of foodstuffs. Orders and Regulations introduced during the year have included an amended Arsenic in Food Regulation dealing with the maximum amount of arsenic permitted in yeast and yeast products, and a Regulation to enable consumers to distinguish between whole milk and " filled " milk. The latter material may be in liquid, dried or condensed form but is in fact milk from which all the butter fat or cream has been removed and replaced by a vegetable fat or some fat other than milk fat. Reports have also appeared on Bread and Flour, Antioxidants in food and amended methods and Standards for the examination of " designated " milk. It is of interest that the year 1960 saw the centenary of the first attempt to maintain standards of purity for food. The first Food Act was passed in 1860, and this and succeeding Acts have had a profound and marked effect upon the quality of food, not only in this country but throughout the world. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, C. Harcourt Wordsworth, Public Analyst. 34 Report of the Welfare Officer (Miss I. O. D. Harrison, S.S.D.(Lond.), M.I.W.O.) On first taking up my appointment in December, 1959, I found that as it was a new and rather unique type of appointment there were no clear-cut terms of reference and that the description of my function was open to wide interpretation. Until I had been able to ascertain what the problems were it was obviously impossible for me to form a plan of campaign for tackling them. To this end my first step was to get to know the other official and voluntary officers and associations and authorities in the area who were in some way concerned with the problem. In this way I was able to see the size and variety of problems that existed in the Borough and to see how deeply the non-white and other migrant people were concerned and involved with these problems. In parallel with these enquiries and introductions I made it my business to introduce myself to, and make contact with, organisations and authorities and the various interested people who were experiencing problems of approximately the same type in their respective areas, including those outside London. This extended of course to the Migrants Division. My reception by all these people was a most cordial one. They were most helpful particularly because they felt here was an officer who would be able to deal with those problems which, in their opinion, presented particular difficulties. At the same time none of them seemed at all clear about what my exact function was, or what responsibilities or powers (if any) I had. In the initial stage I was fortunate in not being pressed to be concise about my duties, as in fact I was not then quite certain how things would develop. It is a matter of interest—one might say self-interest—that I was introduced and addressed by most people with the description which probably suited their own particular interpretation of my function, i.e., Welfare Officer Coloured People, Welfare Officer West Indians, West Indian Social Case Worker, Information Officer, Community Relations Officer, Coloured People's Visitor and the like. At an early stage it became imperative to make it abundantly clear that my function was not just to be concerned with coloured people or just West Indians. It was necessary for me repeatedly to stress to many people that I was concerned with problems caused directly or indirectly by any newcomers to the Borough who by advent caused problems or found problems thrust upon them. Nevertheless, quite understandably I very shortly found that an enormous number of non-white people with problems were being referred to me when the problems were appropriate to the organisation which was referring them. The only reason in fact why I was getting these problems was because their colour or accent was making them different. This I suggested was because those who came from overseas could be puzzling to most people and that those referring them tended to hope that I had specific knowledge and ability for dealing with them, and therefore I should be able to assist. Approaches of this kind needed to be dealt with very firmly. In the first place the various appropriate organisations officially exist and should deal with them, and should try to understand that a person who is not a native of Paddington does not 35 need "specialist" treatment, although he might need a little more patience and knowledge of the background might be helpful. Of course I was always happy to provide any information I may have had, or if I did not know the answer myself suggest some specialised authority where this information might be obtained. In the second place the sheer weight of numbers concerned would make it physically impossible for anything less than a very large department to deal with. My policy has been conditioned all the while by the principle that our ultimate aim is the integration and assimilation into our society of this influx of immigrants and with as little disruption as possible. Any suggestion of segregation in this whole field would be a very retrograde step. I have frequently found myself explaining that generally people from overseas were coming to England because they were attracted to the prospect of a reasonable standard of living in common with the other inhabitants. They did not ask for special consideration and in fact the provision of any special official arrangements could only tend to make them feel they were being looked on as different and as a special problem. Also this would make different looking people a target for discriminators. Unfortunately at this stage we must always bear in mind that there is not sufficient enlightenment on either side to cancel out the feelings of prejudice that still exist, and therefore any decision or action taken in this connection needs the most conscientious and painstaking examination. I am pleased to say that by now the position is pretty generally understood and in fact the various problems that arise are being dealt with by the organisations in the normal course of routine. Inevitably the outcome of this tidying up has resulted in the fact that all cases that are not the clear cut property of one organisation or another come to me. This in effect means that the overwhelming number of problems I deal with are the ones of friction and misunderstanding between landlord and tenant, tenant and tenant, or neighbours. These cases are referred to me by most of the organisations including the Court and police. It is flattering to realise that when there is a misunderstanding that cannot be resolved by law it is hoped that my personal approach and explanation to both sides may be helpful. Before discussing the types of problems which are coming to me I think it would be useful to recall that historically Paddington is a place that has always had social problems, mainly because a large section of the Borough has always been occupied by a transient population. It is a main railway terminus, adjacent to the West End and with a large number of hotels and the cheaper type of lodging houses. The houses in Paddington are generally large and do not conveniently lend themselves to being split up, but most of them are divided into flats, flatlets and bed-sitters. Added to that it has a very mixed community both socially and racially. This type of area has always attracted newcomers and migrants and unfortunately also people who are drifters or social casualties. I think it fair to point out that the problems which I have encountered are as a result of the general pattern and structure of such an area such as I have outlined and which has always existed. 36 The influx of immigrants to the Borough has naturally increased the total number of those problems and with it of course the number of non-white and other overseas people involved. The difference in customs and social behaviour between these different types and races, particularly when they are living together in large sub-divided houses, is certain to give rise to various problems. Many of the landlord-tenant problems involving newcomers appear to stem from the fact that house purchase is often embarked upon without an understanding or realisation of what is entailed. Paying too much for property, buying property in serious disrepair, or where there is a Compulsory Purchase Order pending, or on too short a lease term, and even worse, taking up mortgages without sufficient care and advice. Housing as we know is a field which may lend itself to exploitation and people who are unfamiliar with this type of transaction need expert and sympathetic advice before they commit themselves. In my attempts to avert this type of problem I have taken every opportunity available to draw the attention of would-be purchasers to the pitfalls of unwise purchase. In fact I mention this specifically to every likely person, particularly a coloured person, who consults me on any type of problem. I have systematically approached Personnel and Welfare Officers of industries employing such people, and some have co-operated to the extent of posting warning notices in the canteens suggesting that any would-be purchaser of property would be well advised to approach their local Citizens' Advice Bureau before getting involved. One of the small committees on which I serve has prepared an article on the pitfalls of unwise house purchase which is to appear in the periodical Tropicana. Matrimonial problems are fairly high on my list, and are increasing in number no doubt because over the last year more West Indian families are joining their husbands. Naturally these are problems that frequently cannot be effectively dealt with by Marriage Guidance Officers and usual Welfare Officers because the sharp difference in attitude and social customs is such that normal advice given to people in this country may not be in any way appropriate. Problems of adolescents comprise a significant proportion. To date, a relatively small number of young people are coming to this country. Nevertheless, among those who have come and had no schooling in this country, there are a number who have difficulties of adjustment and finding suitable employment. I feel it relevant to point out that my work is not that of a caseworker. Because of the time factor and the enormous volume of work my services are necessarily restricted to people with problems rather than people who are themselves problems, and therefore require regular close supervision and guidance. So that I may keep up with developments and trends and to maintain close liaison with other interested authorities, a great deal of my time is devoted to attending conferences, lectures, meetings and discussion groups which are not necessarily confined to Paddington and which take place at lunch time, in the afternoons and evenings—one or two even at weekends. 37 I cannot conclude this brief survey of my work without paying a sincere tribute to the help, courtesy and advice of Dr. Oldershaw. At the same time I should like to put on record my appreciation of the friendly co-operation of many members of the Town Hall staff, and of Mr. Ruffey and Mr. Parker and other administrative officers in my own Department. I have also received the fullest co-operation and help from the London County Council Departments. 38 The Ministry of Health has requested that the following figures regarding factories and outworkers should be annexed to the Annual Report.
