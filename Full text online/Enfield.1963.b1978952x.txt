Ac 739(1) ENF 47 Borough Council of Enfield ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health (WILLIAM D. HYDE, M.B., Ch.B., D.P.H.) FOR 1963 Borough Council of Enfield ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health (WILLIAM D. HYDE, M.B., Ch.B., D.P.H.) FOR 1963 3 ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, 1963. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Enfield. I have pleasure in presenting my Annual Report for 1963. I have previously drawn attention to the wide variety of environmental conditions to be found in a Borough like Enfield which has grown rapidly in a comparatively short period of time. In Enfield one has to deal not only with complex urban problems but also those of a rural nature. As in previous years, the work of the Department has been directed mainly towards the control of infectious disease, the provision and maintenance of fit dwellings, sound drainage, pure and wholesome food and water, clean air, and freedom from excessive noise. The list of inspections and visits made by the staff shows the wide nature of the investigations carried out, but the number is lower this year, owing to a serious shortage of Public Health Inspectors. This has led to a policy of attention being limited mainly to the essential and urgent matters that arise daily. With regard to Infectious Disease, it was a year for Measles, following the comparatively low number the previous year. This is one of the dwindling number of infectious diseases for which, as yet, no completely satisfactory means of immunisation is available, although progress is being made in this direction. There was a reduction in the number of notified cases of Respiratory Tuberculosis. The general trend towards notifications in the older age groups, especially in males, is evident in the figures, and emphasizes the need for vigilance in regard to the dangers to family and other contacts from these older patients. Another aspect which is of some impoitance was the marked increase in the number of notified tuberculous patients who came to reside in Enfield. With regard to the fight against Bovine Tuberculosis with its public health dangers, a significant factor has been the continuing improvement, over the years, in the hygienic quality of milk, and as from 1964, under the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations 1963, there will be three special designations for Milk, namely, "Pasteurised," "Sterilised" and "Untreated." "Untreated" is a new designation for raw milk, and as all milk in England and 4 Wales now comes from attested herds the designation "Tuberculin Tested " will not be used. Whilst on the subject of raw milk, its association at times with Brucellosis should not be overlooked. Incidentally and controversially, Brucellosis is not a notifiable disease, but notification was received during the year of a man suffering from the illness. He gave a history of the consumption of raw milk in a distant country district some weeks previously, and the information was passed to the appropriate authority for investigation. Climatic conditions have an effect on the incidence of some infectious diseases and although there was no serious prevalence of fog during the year, there was a prolonged period of snowy weather at the beginning of the year which may have had some influence on the increased number of deaths from pneumonia. The efforts in connection with immunisation against various infectious diseases continued as in previous years, the most noticeable decline being in the figures for smallpox vaccination as was to be expected after the previous year's exceptionally high figures, when a very large number of persons came forward for vaccination as a result of the importation of smallpox into the country. With regard to the Vital Statistics of the Borough, there was no significant change in the Death Rate, nor in the Infant Mortality Rate which was slightly lower than last year and compares favourably with the National figure. The greatest number of infant deaths occurred in children under the age of one week, the causes of death being that hard core of ever-recurring conditions whose prevention seems to be outwith our grasp at present, namely prematurity, birth injury and congenital defects. Nevertheless, the figures are a marked improvement on last year for these early deaths, but unfortunately, the same cannot be said for deaths from pneumonia and bronchitis in the older age groups. The Birth Rate was not as high as last year, but still higher than the rates for the years since the immediate post-war peak. There was no maternal death but unfortunately there was an increase in the number of still-births, which, together with the early neonatal deaths, gives a slightly higher Peri-natal Mortality Rate than last year, and emphasizes the need for special attention to the difficult problem of Peri-natal mortality. Cancer continues to take an ever-increasing toll of life although this year there were slightly fewer deaths from cancer of the lungs and bronchus. Nevertheless, there were fifty-seven deaths from this cause compared with only four deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis. 5 The harmful effects of smoking were again given national publicity and every opportunity was taken to re-inforce this locally. The help was enlisted of a special publicity unit of the Central Council for Health Education, to direct information on this subject to school children. Although it was only possible to arrange visits of the unit to a few schools, it is believed that the impact was worthwhile. In common with many authorities it is felt that the greatest hope of success in this field is in deterring young people from starting to smoke. The deaths from cancer of the cervix uteri of five married or widowed women, three aged sixty-nine years, one aged forty-eight years and one aged forty years, are recorded. These deaths are of special significance in view of the recent publicity given to the development of techniques for the early diagnosis of this condition by cytological investigation. With regard to deaths from other causes, reference must be made to the increase in anginal deaths but this was largely compensated by a reduction in deaths from other heart diseases. Unfortunately, there was quite a marked increase in the number of deaths due to accidents in the home, most of the victims, as usual, being elderly folk who succumbed to the after effects of injury due to a fall. A welcome, but surprising, reduction has taken place in the number of deaths from road accidents—surprising because, in my opinion from personal observation, the four main factors are still prevalent, namely, haste, impatience, selfishness and downright bad manners by all categories of road users. The question of additives to foodstuffs is a controversial subject and during the year there was an instance of a raw meat product, to which had been added an excess of a preparation for enhancing its appearance, causing unpleasant symptoms to consumers. The use of this preparation in such circumstances has now been made illegal. The unauthorised parking of caravans created even more concern and nuisance than last year. Action was taken to remove no less than four hundred and seventy-eight caravans from unauthorised sites. The time and effort expended in this direction by a depleted staff could well have been used in other activities. In conclusion I would like to express my appreciation of the service of the staff of the Health Department during the year. William D. Hyde, Medical Officer of Health. 6 BOROUGH OF ENFIELD Alderman A. H. Chambers, J.P. Mayor Alderman E. L. Mackenzie, J.P. Deputy Mayor Aldermen : W. G. Bowyer, Esq. F. C. Cunneen, Esq. D. R. J.

(Number of deaths of infants aged four weeks but under one year of age per 1,000 live births.) 12 FATAL ACCIDENTS During the year under review, there were twenty fatal home accidents to Enfield residents, this figure being eight more than the previous year. In three cases, deaths occurred of young children : at age three months from suffocation by a pillow, at eleven months from asphyxia when the child's neck was trapped by a collapsed pram, and at age fifteen months fiom a fall downstairs when pneumonia followed lung contusion. Of the remainder, fourteen occurred amongst elderly people— ten being over eighty years of age. The precipitating cause of death in eleven cases was a fall leading in most instances to fractured bones followed usually by lung complications. Of the other deaths, three were due to accidental coal gas poisoning and three from burns sustained following accidents with a gas ring, an open fire, and an electric fire. The number of fatal road accidents to Enfield residents was five which was a decrease of fourteen on the previous year. Unfortunately there were nine cases of suicide (five male and four female) although this was a reduction of five on the previous year. Two of these were aged between 25 and 44 years, four aged between 45 and 64 years, two aged between 65 and 74 years and one aged over 75 years. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACTS, 1948 AND 1951. No action was necessary during the year under these Acts. Such cases as were brought to the notice of the Health Department were dealt with by the Medical Officer of Health in cooperation either with the Medical Practitioners or Welfare Officer, and the patients voluntarily agreed to go to Hospital or suitable Home. Most old people show a natural reluctance to leave their homes, which sometimes consist of a single room in a dirty and unhygienic state owing to their inability to look after the premises. Some should not be living alone, and although we must not be hasty to criticize, there appears to be in some cases a need for the awakening of responsibility of the family to its aged members. In some instances, where reluctance to leave their homes is encountered, provision of Home Help and District Nurse Services can be arranged and a careful watch on the situation maintained by members of the Health Department Staff. Compulsory removal in the interests of the old person is rarely enforced, as persuasion usually succeeds in the end. 13 AMBULANCE SERVICE The headquarters of this service which comes under the control of the County Medical Officer, Middlesex County Council, are at Kenton, Middlesex. All telephone calls and enquiries regarding the ambulance service in Enfield are routed through an ambulance control depot which is situated in Edmonton. The Emergency telephone call service can be used for urgent calls. For dealing with emergencies in Enfield, one accident ambulance is kept at Ponders End Fire Station and another at the Ambulance Sick Removal Depot, The Ridgeway, near Chase Farm Hospital. There are also kept at the Sick Removal Depot, a number of ambulances for dealing with more routine duties including the transport of outpatients and sitting cases to hospitals for treatment. WATER SUPPLY The Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board, except for part of the Hadley Wood and Cockfosters area, which is supplied by the Lee Valley Water Company. Both of these Authorities take regular and frequent samples for analysis. Copies of the reports on these are sent to the Health Department, and have shown satisfactory results. There was no cause to suspect any contamination during the year. The question of well-water supplies, both in connection with dwelling-houses and industrial premises, throughout the Borough has received the careful attention of the Department during the year, and every care has been exercised to see that such supplies are not used for drinking purposes where mains water supply is available. There is now only one dwelling in Enfield which relies solely on well water for its water supply and this is under regular supervision. MEDICAL ASSESSMENT OF EMPLOYEES. The following medical examinations or assessments of employees were carried out during the year:— (1) Superannuation Act: Medical examinations 45 Assessments without medical examinations 60 (2) Sick Pay Scheme : Medical examinations 69 Assessments without medical examinations 70 (3) Special examinations for fitness to continue employment 15 14 PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1961 The purpose of the Act is mainly to amend the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1936, relating to building bye-laws and trade effluents, and also public health matters formerly dealt with under local acts. Part II of the Act deals with building regulations, sewers, drains and sanitary conveniences; buildings and structures ; accumulations of rubbish ; and filthy or verminous premises and articles. Part III deals with the prevention and notification of infectious disease, and gives powers of medical examination of persons in certain circumstances; makes provision for information to be furnished by the occupier of premises in cases of notifiable disease or food poisoning ; provides for the exclusion of children from places of entertainment, etc., with a view to preventing the spread of infectious disease ; makes provisions for compensating persons who, on the request of the Medical Officer of Health discontinue work to prevent the spread of notifiable disease ; and in connection with the selling to children under the age of fourteen years, by dealers in rags and old clothes, adds any animal, fish, bird or other living thing to " article " as used in the Public Health Act, 1936. Part IV deals with streets and public places. Part V deals with trade effluents. Part VI deals with a miscellaneous number of items, including the power to reduce the numbers of pigeons and other birds in built-up areas, as well as powers to make bye-laws relating to hairdressers and barbers. (Byelaws have been in existence in Enfield since 1937.) HOUSING Number of new houses erected during the year by:— (a) Local Authority 220 (b) Other Local Authorities — (c) Other bodies or persons 210 With State assistance (included in above totals) :— (a) Local Authority 220 (b) Other Local Authorities — (c) Other bodies or persons — 1.

One of the most important provisions of this legislation is the power given to local authorities to deal with houses in multiple occupation, and action was taken in this respect during the year. HOUSE PURCHASE AND HOUSING ACT, 1959. This Act deals with financial assistance towards the provision of five basic housing improvements, namely, a bath or shower, a wash-hand basin, a water closet, a hot water system, and a food store. There is also a Discretionary Grant Scheme for a wider range of improvements and conversions. Many inspections are necessary in connection with these provisions, and during the year 1,458 visits to premises were made by the Inspectorial staff.

In my Annual Report for 1962 I reported that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had accepted the Council's Slaughterhouse Report which had been held in abeyance pending 17 the outcome of a planning appeal, and made 1st July, 1963, the Appointed Day from which the sole slaughterhouse in the Borough must comply with the Regulations. The owners however, decided to cease to operate the slaughterhouse on the 27th May, 1963.

These included school and factory canteens, public houses, bakehouses, ice-cream shops and vehicles, hawkers stalls and storage premises. Improvements of a general character were effected in thirteen cases. Food stalls at a fair on a Council owned site within the Borough, which is leased on occasions to a firm of showmen, were carefully supervised. Also, care continued to be taken to ensure that the caterer at the Annual Enfield Show in the Town Park maintained a standard required by the Regulations. One additional factory canteen was provided during the year and another rebuilt on modern lines following damage by fire. A new pavilion was provided by a Sports and Social Club, replacing premises which were not of such a high standard. Many visits were made in connection with a number of complaints regarding food and drink and amongst the complaints investigated were those involving foreign bodies in bread, china in meat, dirt in a tin of gooseberries, wire in sausage, glass in bread, paper in ice lolly, deposit in milk bottle, foreign body in fish, unsound crab, insect in Christmas pudding, maggots in bacon, dirty biscuits, dirty bread, blue stain on potato crisps, staining on corned beef, mouldy sausages, mould on a steak and kidney pie, mouldy luncheon meat, mouldy bread, abnormal smell in ham. Eight prosecutions were taken during the year under Section 2 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955. A grocer was prosecuted for selling a mouldy loaf, and was fined £30 plus £5 5s. 0d., costs. The same grocer was prosecuted for selling chocolate containing insect larvae and was fined £5 plus £5 5s. 0d., costs. This grocer was prosecuted for the third time for selling mouldy sausages and was fined £30 plus £5 5s. 0d., costs. A baker was prosecuted for selling a loaf containing a dead fly, but the case was dismissed. This baker was later prosecuted for selling a loaf containing a metal screw and was fined £20 plus £5 5s. 0d., costs. Another baker was prosecuted for selling a loaf containing a piece of metal and was fined £10 plus £3 3s. 0d., costs. A third baker was prosecuted for selling a fruit loaf containing a piece of cloth and was fined £5 plus £3 3s. 0d., costs. 21 A fishmonger was prosecuted for selling a fried hake steak containing a piece of material and was conditionally discharged on payment of £5 5s.

Two of the rodent operatives carried out sewer treatment by Sodium Fluoracetate in damp coarse oatmeal involving 1,769 manholes. The other two operatives dealt with surface infestations. 1,039 premises were inspected during the year, and of these 442 were found to be infested with rats or mice. 27 The total number of treatments carried out by the Department including domestic, business and factory premises, was 442. During the year the Public Health Inspectors and Rodent Investigating Staff made altogether 4,663 visits concerning rat infestation. The Council provides this service to the occupiers of all dwellinghouses free of charge. Industrial and business premises are dealt with at the request of the proprietors who pay the full cost of any disinfestation undertaken at their premises. INFESTATION WITH INSECTS, ETC.

There are four premises in Enfield which are registered under this Act. NOISE ABATEMENT ACT, 1960 This Act makes noise or vibration which would amount to a nuisance at common law a statutory nuisance which can be dealt with according to the procedure provided in part III of the Public Health Act, 1936. 31 It also deals with the use of loudspeakers in streets. The Act does not apply to noise or vibration caused by aircraft nor to noise or vibration caused by statutory undertakers in the exercise of their powers. Several investigations regarding complaints of noise were carried out during the year. CARAVAN SITES AND CONTROL OF DEVELOPMENT ACT, 1960 This Act makes provision for the licensing and control of caravan sites, and authorises local authorities to provide and operate caravan sites. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government has also issued Model Standards under section 5 of the Act. Reference to the control of caravans is made in the preamble to this Report. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. This Act controls the keeping of pet shops. During the course of the year five premises previously licensed by the local authority were re-licensed. CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 1961. THE HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) REGULATIONS, 1953. THE OIL HEATERS REGULATIONS, 1962. Under Section One of the Consumer Protection Act, 1961, the Secretary of State may by regulation, impose safety requirements respecting any prescribed class of goods or component parts, and also secure that such goods or component parts are in a prescribed manner, marked with, or accompanied by, any warning or instructions which are considered expedient. Section Two of the Act, prohibits the sale of goods not complying with regulations made under Section One. The Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952, was repealed by the Consumer Protection Act, 1961, but Regulations made under the former Act in 1953, remain effective as if made under Section One of the Consumer Protection Act, 1961. These Regulations require fireguards to be fitted to gas fires, electric fires and oil heaters of types so designed that they are suitable for domestic use, and so constructed, that without a guard there is likelihood of injury by burning, or of ignition of clothing by reason of contact with, or proximity to the heating element or flame. The Oil Burners (Standards) Act, 1960, was also repealed by the Consumer Protection Act, 1961, but under the latter Act, the Oil 32 Heaters Regulations 1962, came into operation on 1st June, 1962, and imposed certain requirements regarding oil heaters with a view to preventing, or reducing, risk of death or personal injury. The Regulations relate to warning notices to be borne by heaters; their construction, design and performance generally; tests of risk of fire to walls and floors and for test of resistance to draughts. Provision is also made for tests of goods purchased for the purpose by a local authority, to be carried out at the expense of the local authority by any such person or body as may be authorised by the Secretary of State. LICENSING ACT, 1961. Under this new legislation, any applications to the licensing justices for licences to retail intoxicating liquor, are first refeired to the Borough Council for opinion as to the geneial suitability including satisfactory siting of the premises, the provision of adequate sanitary accommodation, and compliance with the Food Hygiene Regulations. 45 applications were referred during the year which necessitated 58 visits being made to premises by the Public Health Inspectors. FACTORIES ACT, 1961 A register is kept of all the factories in the Borough, and during the year 48 inspections were carried out. 1.—INSPECTIONS for purposes of provisions as to health (including inspections made by Public Health Inspectors).

Byelaws were made in 1937 for the purpose of securing the cleanliness of any premises used for carrying on the business of a hairdresser or barber and of the instruments, towels, and materials used in such premises. These byelaws have proved useful in maintaining a high standard in the premises of the Borough. PLACES OF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT Number of inspections of sanitary accommodation 142 OFFENSIVE TRADES. Byelaws with respect to the regulation of the offensive trade of a dealer in butchers' waste were confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and came into operation on 1st April, 1963. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 In 1959, local authorities submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government dates by which they expected that their areas could be completely smoke controlled, and also outlined their programmes for the five year period 1959-1963. As some authorities found that they could complete their programmes in advance of the dates given, and others were unable to keep to their scheduled programme, the Minister in 1962 considered that it was time for a general review of the position. Authorities were, therefore, requested to re-examine their programmes with a view to expediting completion, bearing in mind the time likely to be saved by the recently introduced simplified method of making smoke control areas. The Council, accordingly, revised the programme formulated in 1959 in which the target year for completion was 1974, and gave approval to a new programme of approximately 3,000 houses being dealt with each year for the five year period 1962-66, the target year for completion of the whole Borough being 1972. 35 With the modification that the Order would become operative on the 1st December, 1963, the Minister confirmed the Enfield Smoke Control Order No. 4 on 14th May, 1963, thus giving householders ample time to comply with the provisions of the Order. With the completion of this fourth area a total of 8,273 dwellings etc., and 7,887 acres have been included in Smoke Control Areas. A survey is now being made in respect of proposed Smoke Control Area No. 5. This Area includes that part of the Borough bounded to the North, by Lancaster Road (South Side) and Lavender Hill (South Side) to The Ridgeway—to the East, by Silver Street (West side) and Baker Street (West side) to Lancaster Road— to the West, by The Ridgeway (east side) from Lavender Hill to Windmill Hill, and to the South, by Windmill Hill (north side) from The Ridgeway through Church Street (north side) to Silver Street. National Survey of Pollution. Estimations of daily smoke and sulphur dioxide concentrations were made at four sites in the Borough throughout 1963, the second year these sites have been in operation, in connection with the National Investigation of Atmospheric Pollution. The instruments are sited in accordance with the recommendations of the Working Party set up by the Co-operating Bodies in the Investigation of Atmospheric Pollution. Station 1.

As in 1962 it will be seen that during the winter months station 4 shows the highest smoke concentration with also an associated high level of sulphur dioxide pollution, whilst throughout nearly the whole year station 2 has the highest sulphur dioxide level with the second highest level of smoke concentration. The annual average for smoke (Table F) shows a marked reduction over last year's figures, and a smaller reduction is seen in the case of sulphur dioxide, except for station 2 where there was a very slight increase. But if one looks at the figures for the months of January and February, 1963, it will be seen that the overall improvement is not applicable. There was no period of dense fog during 1963 but an extremely cold spell, with heavy snowfalls and severe frost, was experienced in January and February, resulting in increased fuel consumption by industry, commerce and private householders. Comparison with the corresponding months in 1962 and the percentage increase in pollution levels are shown in Tables C and D. 37 C. Smoke (average daily amounts) Jan./Feb. 1963 and Jan./Feb. 1962. 1963 1962 Percentage increase. Station 1 117.5 79.5 47.7 Station 2 209.5 135.5 54.6 Station 3 142.5 83.5 70.6 Station 4 227.5 109.5 108.2 D.

It is significant to note that the percentage increase in sulphur dioxide recordings is similar at all four stations. Many criticisms of the use of solid smokeless fuels are received by the Health Department, during the period preceding the introduction of a new smoke control area, on the grounds that excessive sulphur fumes are emitted by the manufactured fuels. The figures shown in Table D indicate strongly that this is not so. The information gleaned from these figures is encouraging, and, in the years to come will give valuable information in relation to the progress made in smoke control areas. The tables E and F show the ratio of smoke to sulphur dioxide and the annual averages. E. Smoke/Sulphur dioxide Ratio. Station Jan. Feb.

As regards the purification of the water, the up-to-date method of chlorination, filtration and aeration is used at both premises. This gives a safe and pleasant bathing water. Reports on the examinations for chlorine and alkalinity of the water, which are made several times daily, are sent to the Medical Officer of Health, and the Public Health Inspectors take samples for bacteriological tests at appropriate intervals. At both the open-air pool and the indoor bath, slipper bath facilities are available. PUBLIC MORTUARY There is now no public mortuary in Enfield, but use is made at present of a Hospital Mortuary.
