SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT. The Board of Works for the Fulham District, report that during the past year they have further extended the Lighting in the parish of Fulham by the erection of 28 additional gas lights, whereby much satisfaction has been given. The total number of lights in that parish is now 239, and in Hammersmith 426. The number of cases of Nuisances removed during the same period:— Privies and cesspools emptied 436 Drains and gullies cleansed and repaired 226 Houses ditto ditto 113 Swine nuisances removed 51 Miscellaneous 108 934 Houses benefited in Fulham 559 „ „ Hammersmith 467 1026 The Board refer with satisfaction to the improved sanitary condition of the district, and solicit attention to the important Report of the Medical Officer of Health presented herewith. The Board have at length brought their proceedings in the matter of the purchase of Little Wapping nearly to a close, and hope to have the old houses there cleared away by Midsummer. This they regard as of great importance, inasmuch that it may lead to further improvements, whereby the rental of the parish of Hammersmith would be largely increased, and a corresponding reduction of the rates effected. They have also arranged that the repairs of that part of Norland Road, situate in the parish of Hammersmith, be done by the Kensington Vestry, the Board agreeing to pay to such Vestry the sum of £35. per annum. In preparing the Estimates for the past year the Board had to consider the complaints of many ratepayers relating to the state of the district roads and footpaths, and found that in order to effect a material improvement in the same the General Rate would have to be largely increased. It was therefore with much regret they were obliged to issue precepts for amounts in excess of former years. They, 6 however, believe that the worst is now past, and that less sums will in future be required for those purposes. The Board have carried out further permanent works in the parish of Hammersmith, namely, in Hammersmith Terrace, and the west side footpath of the Grove. They have also reversed the drainage of the houses on the west side of Richmond Road, Shepherd's Bush, whereby the sewerage has been diverted from the field locally known as the Dismal Swamp, into the Acton line of Sewer, and a nuisance of a fearful character entirely removed. This latter work has been done principally at the expense of the owners of property. The Board have repeatedly urged upon the Metropolitan Board of Works to commence their scheme of drainage for this district, and have received from them an assurance that the works connected therewith would be begun during this year. They have also obtained the consent of that body to the construction of a sewer in the New Road, Hammersmith, from the Queen of England public-house to the Albion Road Sewer, and in King Street from the Creek to the Broadway, and for the borrowing of the money to pay the cost of the same at 4½ per cent. interest per annum, to be repaid in equal annual instalments in 20 years. Abstracts of contracts and amounts are presented herewith, together with the certificate of the Auditors as to the correctness of such accounts.

We hereby certify that we have carefully examined, the accounts and books of accounts of the Board of Works for the Fulham District, for the year ending 25th day of March, 1862, and have compared them with the vouchers, and find the several receipts and entries thereof to be correct; we also certify to the correctness of the abstract of accounts, together with the assets and liabilities to the several parishes. We found a balance at the bankers at the commencement of the year of the sum of £322 : 18 : 10, and at the close of the audit we leave a balance of £814 : 19 : 9 ; on analyzing which we find of this sum £188 : 8 : 0 in favor of Fulham, and £626 : 1 : 9 in favor of Hammersmith, the liabilities of each parish being clearly shewn in the abstracts to be published. We also find a payment of £31 : 6 : 8 to Messrs. Bloxam and Hawkins, the Solicitors in the action of F. Scott v. the Board of Works: we cannot but express regret that the Board should have defended that action, no doubt they thought themselves justified, but in our opinion, legal proceedings of such a doubtful character had better have been avoided. (Signed,) WILLIAM MUSSARED, ) HENRY WILLIAM KEYS, Auditors. S. G. BOND, Board Room, Broadway House, May 28th, 1862. SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Board of Works, Fulham District. Gentlemen, On the 8th of April of the past year, the day on which the people were numbered throughout England and Wales, the population of the Fulham district was 39,951, of which Hammersmith contained 24,413 and Eulham 15,538, and if the inhabitants of these parishes increased in the same proportion as the rest of the metropolis, which there is every reason to believe was the case, those numbers were augmented by the end of the year to upwards of 24,700 and 15,700 respectively. In 1851 the population of Hammersmith was 17,760, of Eulham 11,886, so that in the ten years, 1851 to 1861, the former increased 6653 and the latter 3652, whilst upwards of 1100 inhabited houses have been added to the district. SICKNESS AND MORTALITY. The year 1861 has been marked by one of those periodical visitations of epidemic disease which have attended the progress of large populations, and the general mortality of London has been increased by about 3000 over that of the preceding year. Scarlatina and diptheria have prevailed, whilst a considerable mortality has arisen from whooping-cough. The Eulham district has not proved exempt from the general influence. Scarlet fever made its appearance towards the latter part of the year, and contributed 40 to our mortality. As may be expected from the nature of the population, Fulham has given 35 of the number, but it is satisfactory evidence of the influence of sanitary measures to observe that no special locality has prominently suffered from its attack. The deaths have been distributed over the general area, and it is fair to presume that whilst the epidemic poison was floating in the air, it found not the usual localized food for its destructive influences amongst us. Isolated cases of Diptheria have, from time to time, during 1861, been noticed, though it added only two to the mortality in the district. Medical science has not yet achieved a perfect knowledge of this mysterious visitant, but there is reason to hope, that should it continue in our list of prevalent diseases, the mortality from it will be more than proportionately diminished as our investigations into its time nature are matured. I am happy to say that no death from Small-Pox has been"recorded during the year, 9 the mortality throughout London from this diease having also been less than during any of the last 13 years. Diarrhoea, an ailment which generally adds materially to the deaths, has in the past year contributed 47. Consumption has cut off 82 persons. The mean rate of mortality for London in 1861 was 2.36, for the Fulham district it has been about 2.24, calculated for the actual population taken at the census. The total number of deaths registered during the year in the district has been 898, of which 492 occurred in Hammersmith and 406 in Fulham. 58 persons have died in the Union House, 12 in Lunatic Asylums, 24 in Roman Catholic Institutions, and 14 in Alms Houses. 40 inquests have been held, 20 in Hammersmith and 20 in Fulham. Of the 898 deaths, 341 had not reached their third year and 384 had not attained their fifth year. It is worthy of note, however, that the mortality records of the past year shew that no less than 54 persons, or 6 per cent. of the whole number, have died at 80 years and upwards, 9 had reached 90, whilst the two eldest had attained their 99th years. One of the latter died in High-street, Fulham, the other at Nazareth House. The number of births registered in the year have been 1255, in Hammersmith 751, in Fulham 504, shewing an excess of 357 over the deaths in the district. In recording the number of deaths in the parishes of Fulham and Hammersmith, it should always be borne in mind that we have several elements at work which most unmistakeably increase our mortality beyond its natural limits. For instance, in Fulham we have several large Lunatic Asylums, the deaths in which, from the several forms of mania and their consequences, are, as a rule, imported cases from different parts of the country : the Union House, too, may add somewhat in this respect. In Hammersmith a considerable addition is made to our mortality by the various Roman Catholic Charitable Institutions, which have lately so much extended here. I have, in former reports, alluded also to the great augmentation of our poorer inhabitants, in consequence of the extending metropolitan destruct'on of small houses. This immigration continues, which, together with a large importation of market-garden labourers and brick-makers during the summer months, places us at a considerable disadvantage in comparing our per centage of death with our natural fixed population. The public papers will have informed you of some important revelations which have lately taken place with regard to the supply of unwholesome and diseased meat to the London market. That food of th's character exerts an injurious influence on public health cannot be doubted, and as it is not improbable that in consequence of the proceedings which have lately been taken within the City, no inconsiderable quantity may in future be forced into the suburban districts, I shall feel it my duty to watch carefully in this matter, and shall hope for your support should it be necessary to act. The prevalence of disease amongst the cows of the London dairies has engaged the attention of the Officers of Health, and of late a contagious eruptive fever has 10 existed amongst them to a considerable extent. It is much to be feared that milk supplied from animals affected by it is quite unfit for human consumption. Dr. Letheby, in his Report to the City Commission of Feb. 4, ult., states, on the authority of Jacob and Professor Hertwig, that it has been found to be positively poisonous, and has caused eruptive fever in persons who have drank it. The amended Local Management Act contains a clause for compelling the licensing of cowsheds, which it is hoped will exercise a most beneficial influence on the health of the cows. DRAINAGE. The want of drainage in several localities, both of Hammersmith and Fulham, still forms a serious drawback to sanitary measures. In the latter especially, this remark applies to almost the entire parish, and the miserable character of its cottage property generally, is likely always, even under the advantages of good sewerage, to prove conducive not only to a high rate of mortality, but inevitably also to a large proportion of sickness, not necessarily fatal, though unequivocably tending to an unnecessary charge upon the poor-rate. It is to be hoped then, that whilst attention is being paid to the providing of the former great sanitary appliance, some care will be bestowed on the improvement of the dwellings of our poor, either by the private proprietors thereof, or by some public effort to purchase and improve, or to build anew. I beg to annex a Report, recently published by the Metropolitan Association, for improving the dwellings of the industrious classes, shewing the successful results of their operations.* WATER SUPPLY. But of all the defects in our sanitary condition which it is my duty to lay before you, there is none of more vital importance than that of water supply. In all the investigations which have been made in the question of public Hygeine, no subject has ever more prominently forced itself on the scientific inquirer than that of the necessity of pure * METROPOLITAN ASSOCIATION. " The directors of this association, for improving the dwellings of the industrious classes, state in their report to the shareholders that the dwellings for 414 families in eight different parts of London cost 74,420/., the gross rents for the year ending 31st of March last, amounted to 6053/., and the expenses to 2876/., leaving a profit of 3137/. Two chambers for 234 and 128 single men respectively cost 15,194/., the gross rents for the year amounted to 1866/., and the total charges to 1886/., showing a loss of 20/. The mortality in the entire property of the association had during the year been 40, out of an average population of 2496, being at the rate of 16 per 1000; 23 of the deaths were of children under 10 years of age. It appeared, therefore, that the average rate of mortality in the buildings of the association had been at the rate of 16 per 1000, while that of the metropolis generally had been 23 per 1000. The net profits of the year exceeded those of the preceding year by 192/., and amount altogether to 2625/., sufficient to pay a dividend of 27/8 per cent., but the directors recommend that a dividend of 2½ per cent., free of income-tax, shoidd be declared, which would leave a balance of about 351/. to be carried to the guarantee fund, increasing that fund to 2008/." 11 water. At the request of the Sanitary Committee, I have lately been engaged in an examination of the well-waters of this district, and at some future time shall have to lay before you the detailed results of my investigations. The extension of deep sewerage through both Fulham and Hammersmith, which I trust may very speedily be effected, will so entirely drain the present surface wells, that it is unnecessary, perhaps, for me to say more now than that they supply a water of highlyobjectionable qualities. A considerable deepening of these will of course, where continued, be necessary, but it is of importance also that every encouragement should be given to the extension of the mains of the different water companies through the district, without which the water clause of the amended Metropolitan Bill will be of little service to us. VENTILATION OF SEWERS. As the contemplated new drainage work proceeds, the subject of the ventilation of the sewers will demand your serious attention. The working of the apparatus suggested by Mr. Bean and myself, which has been in operation at the Broadway, and in the Bridge Road for a considerable time, has been most satisfactory as an experiment. I am of opinion that no objectionable influence has been exerted on the air of the sewer itself, and no complaint has ever been made of smells arising from the shafts where it has been used. Its action in preventing debris falling into the sewer is of remarkable advantage, and the only failing mentioned after a severe trial in the crowded thoroughfares of the City, was its comparative weakness with regard to very heavy traffic. This is, however, entirely a mere question of construction, and does not injuriously affect its applicability for its purpose. A deepening of the flanges, and a slight modification of its superficial area, will completely, I think, overcome this deficiency ; and if a second tolerably close-fitting cage, filled with large pieces of charcoal, be hung at the bottom of the shaft, or a vessel containing common vitriol to absorb the moisture of the cases, be suspended at the same spot, I further believe that the only real drawback to its efficiency would be entirely obviated, and its action perfect. METEROLOGY. The mean reading of the barometer for the year has been 29 968. Mean temperature 49 4. Mean humidity 81. (Saturation=100.) Mean amount of ozone 2.8. Mean cloud 7. The total amount of rain has been 2011 inches which has fallen on 166 days. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, FREDERICK J. BURGE, Medical Officer of Health.
