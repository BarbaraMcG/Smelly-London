DIPLOMATE IN PUBLIC HEALTH, ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS, LONDON. PAST PRESIDENT OF THE METROPOLITAN BRANCH OF THE INCORPORATED SOCIETY OF MEDICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH. MEMBER OF THE SANITARY INSTITUTE. MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE PARISH AND DEPUTY CORONER FOR NORTH.EAST LONDON. LONDON: Harmer & Harley, Ltd., 39 to 44, Cowper Street, E.c. 1899. TO THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF ST. LUKE, MIDDLESEX. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my fourteenth Annual Report dealing with the Health, Sanitary condition, Vital and other Statistics of the Parish for the year 1898. The Sanitary District of St. Luke comprises an area of 239 acres, including Open Spaces and the Basin and Waterway of the Regent's Canal. The number of Inhabited Houses is 3,616. The statistics of Marriages, Births and Deaths contained in this Report relate to the fifty.two weeks ending December 31st, 1898, and are calculated upon a population estimated to the middle of the year of 41,270, being a decrease upon the ascer. tained population at 1896 of 257 persons, and divided between the three Sub.Registration Districts as follows:— Estimated population at Midsummer, 1898. Population at Census, 1896. City Road District 30,162 29,897 Whitecross Street District 7,273 7,595 Finsbury District 3,835 4,035 41,270 41,527 It will be seen from the above figures that while the total decrease has again affected the south side of Old Street, there has been an increase in the northern portion of the Parish of 265 persons. Marriages. The number of Marriages celebrated in St. Luke during the year was 260, the number of persons married being in proportion to 12.5 per 1,000 of the population. The number of Marriages for the two previous years were 290 and 252 respectively. 4 The Metropolitan Marriage.rate for 1898 was 18.7, being the highest recorded for any year since 1877. Births. The Births registered in the Parish during the year numbered 1,854, 954 being boys and 900 girls; of the total number 555 were born in the City of London Lying.in Hospital, but as only 60 of the mothers were permanent residents in the Parish of St. Luke, a deduction of 495 has to be made from this number, leaving 1,395 as the actual figures which represent the Births to be credited to the Parish, and after allotting 60 to the several districts of the Parish in which the parents resided, the Births of the respective sub.districts were as follows :— The number of Births in excess cf the Deaths during the year 1898 amounted to 307. The number of Births registered in London amounted to 132,432, giving a rate of 29'5 per 1000 of the population. This is the lowest London Birth.rate on record, still the excess In the City Road bub.registration District there were 1,073; in the Whitecross Street Sub.Registration District there were 210, and in the Finsbury Sub.Registration District there were 76. In relation to the estimated population the figures stand as under:— Births per 1,000 Inhabitants. For the whole Parish 32.92 City Road Sub.Registration District 35.57 Whitecross Street 28.90 Finsbury 19.81 The following table shows the number of Births belonging to the Parish for the past seven years and rate per 1,000 of the population :— Births. Rate per 1000. 1892 1478 34.89 1898 1420 33.18 1894 1432 53.34 1895 1476 34.18 1896 1509 36.34 1897 1424 34.50 1898 1359 32.92 5 of Births over Deaths was 48,496, the average increment for the previous 10 years having been 48,218 per annum. Deaths. The Deaths from all causes registered during the year, belonging to St. Luke, numbered 1,053, and includes 412 parishioners who died in Institutions outside the Parish, but is exclusive of 124 non.parishioners who died within our parochial boundary. of the 1,053 parishioners, 569 were males and 484 were females, a number which yields upon the estimated population a Death.rate equal to 25.51 per 1,000 persons living, being a slight increase upon the previous three years' Death.rate, as shown by the following figures:— Deaths. Rate per 1000. 1892 1074 25.57 1893 1277 29.84 1894 951 22.14 1895 1216 28.16 1896 1055 25.40 1897 1047 25.36 1898 1053 25.51 The Metropolitan Death.rate for the year was equal to 18.7 per 1,000 of the population, being one of the lowest London Death.rates hitherto recorded. Infant Mortality: Of the 1,053 deaths of parishioners, 459, or 43.5 per cent., occurred to infants under 5 years of age. Mortality over 65 years of age:—183 parishioners were over 65 at the time of death, being at the rate of 17.4 per cent. of the total deaths recorded. The 124 deaths of non.parishioners occurred at the following Hospitals and other places in the Parish:— Royal Hospital tor Diseases of the Chest 89 City of London Lying.in Hospital 13 St. Luke's Hospital for Lunatics 14 St. Mark's Hospital for Fistula 3 Sudden Death in the Street from Heart Disease and Hæmorrhage 4 Crushed by a Lift 1 124 6 Hospitals, Asylums, Infirmaries, Workhouses, and other Institutions and places situated outside the Parish at which parishioners died during the year:— Asylum for Imbeciles, Banstead 4 ,, ,, ,, Caterham 5 ,, ,, ,, Darenth 1 ,, ,, ,, Leavesden 3 ,, ,, Lunatics, Cane Hill 2 ,, ,, ,, Colney Hatch 2 ,, ,, Hanwell 3 Charing Cross Hospital 2 City of London Hospital for Diseases of the Chest 1 ,, „ Infirmary, Bow 1 " Frudheim," St. John's Wood 1 German Hospital, Dalston 2 Guy's „ 1 Hackney Infirmary 1 Hand in Hand Asylum 1 Holborn Union Infirmary, Archway Road 153 ,, Workhouses, Shepherdess Walk and Mitcham 95 Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest, Brompton 3 ,, Sick Children, Great Ormond Street 12 London Docks 1 ,, Hospital 2 Metropolitan Hospital 1 ,, Asylums Board Hospitals 31 Middlesex Hospital 1 North West London Hospital 1 River Lea, Hackney 1 ,, Thames 1 Royal Free Hospital, Gray's Inn Road 1 St. Anue's House, Stoke Newington 1 St. Bartholomew's Hospital 74 St. Thomas's ,, 1 St. Luke's House, Osnaburgh Street 1 Shoreditch Infirmary 1 Temperance Hospital 1 412 The above deaths are referred to in an early paragraph of this Report as those of parishioners who died in Institutions outside 7 the Parish, and it will be seen that they constitute a considerable proportion of the total deaths, viz., 39.1 per cent. The list of such deaths is furnished to me weekly from the Registrar.General's office and is therefore official, nevertheless, I have from time to time had reason to doubt its correctness, more especially of those persons who have died in the various establishments belonging to the Holborn Union, and who are for the most part simply described in the list as of "St. Luke's." I may point out that both of the Workhouses and the Infirmary are situated outside the area of the Holborn Union; during the last half year I have been able by the courtesy of Mr. H. O. Hill, Clerk to the Guardians, to obtain some information of these cases and which has fully confirmed my doubt as to their correctness. During the period above mentioned the total number of Institution deaths returned as belonging to St. Luke was 212, of these 48 died in the several establishments of the Holborn Union, and the result of my enquiries shows that 20 were not parishioners of St. Luke; 16 were described as homeless, 3 as short resident, and 9 only were formerly residents. Assuming the foregoing fairly represents the errors for the year the number of our Institution deaths was 134 instead of 212, and those described as homeless and short resident should have been credited to the districts in which the deaths occurred, as is the practice with respect to persons dying in Lodging.houses and Institutions within the District when the former residence is unknown. Inquests. One hundred and twelve Inquests were held on the bodies of parishioners during the year, being at the rate of 10.6 per cent. of the total deaths. Seventy.one enquiries (four being as to the cause of death of non.parishioners) took place at the Coroner's Court belonging to this Parish, and the cause of death was ascertained by post.mortem examination in 47 instances. The remaining 45 enquiries were held at Hospitals and Institutions outside our parochial area. 8 Of the total Inquests the results were recorded as follows:— Deaths due to Natural Causes 45 ,, Exposure and Privation 2 Accident or Neglect. Deaths due to Injuries the result of blows, falls, &c. 26 ,, ,, from burns, scolds, &c. 7 „ ,, „ being run over 5 ,, Accidental Poisoning 1 ,, Shot by Rifle 1 Suffocation—while in bed with parents 14 Alcoholic excess 5 Suicide by Hanging 2 ,, Drowning 3 ,, Poison 3 ,, Cut Throat 2 116 Returns of Sickness and Mortality. On pages 14 to 26 the following tables will be found: No. 1. giving the population, births, and cases of infectious disease which have come to my knowledge during the year 1898. No. II., the deaths which have been registered in the Parish, including also the deaths of parishioners in hospitals and other institutions outside the Sanitary District, classified according to diseases, ages and localities. These tables are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Local Government Board, in order to ensure greater uniformity in the reports of Medical Officers of Health than formerly existed. No. III. is of a more comprehensive character, and shows the deaths registered from all causes, inclusive of the deaths of parishioners at hospitals and public institutions outside the District, but exclusive of the deaths of non.parishioners at public institutions within the Parish. No. IV. is a summary of the population births and deaths with rates per 1,000 of persons living in the Parish for the ten years 1889 to 1897 inclusive. No. V. is a return prepared by Mr. Hibbert, the Vaccination Officer, setting forth the number of cases of successful vaccination, so far as relates to children whose births were registered during the year ending June 30th, 1898. The figures show that 9 those not yet found in consequence of removals, etc., number 193 out of a total of 1,872, being 10.3 per cent., a deficiency somewhat less than in former years. It will be seen from this Return that in 5 cases only was exemption claimed under Sec. 2 (which has very aptly been described as the Objectionable Conscience Clause) of the Vaccination Act. Sickness and Deaths due to the Principal Zymotic or Communicable Diseases. Small.pox.—For the fourth successive year I am in a position to report that no death from this cause has occurred to any parishioner of St. Luke, nor has any case of sickness from the disease been notified. The Metropolis furnished only one death from Small.pox against 16 for the year 1897. Scarlet Fever was the registered cause of deaths in London in 583 instances, being the smallest number recorded from this disease since 1891, and being at the rate of 0.13 per 1,000 of the population living as compared with 0.23, the average rate in the 10 years immediately preceding; of these 853 deaths, 494 or nearly 85 per cent. occurred in public institutions. Belonging to our own district 17 deaths were certified, 16 of which took place in the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals. This is a less favourable return than for the year 1897, when the deaths numbered 13. The returns of sickness from the same cause were, however, less, the numbers being 197 for 1898 and 234 for 1897. Diphtheria caused the deaths of 21 parishioners, a number precisely the same as was recorded for the year 1897. In the Registrar.General's Annual Summary St. Luke is classed amongst the London Sanitary areas which during the past year yielded the highest death.rates from diphtheria, viz., 0.59 per 1,000, and was only exceeded by St. George's, Southwark, with 0.60; St. Saviour's, Southwark, 0.70; Battersea, 0.70; and in Holborn with 0.73. 1772 deaths occurred in London from this cause during the year, being equal to a death.rate of 0.39 per 1,000 against 0.54 and 0.60 for the two previous years. Fever.Under this heading 4 deaths were registered as belonging to the Parish, two being ascribed to Enteric or Typhoid Fever and two to Puerperal Fever. One of the former died in the City Road District and one in the Asylums Board Hospital. 10 Both the puerperal cases died in St. Bartholomew's Hospital, whence they had been removed from their own homes while sulfering from the disease and after complicated labours. There were 598 deaths classed as "Fever" within the Metropolitan Area during the year, being equal to a rate of 0.13 per 1,000, and slightly below the average rate (0.15) in the previous ten years. It is gratifying to note that St. Luke stands amongst the sanitary areas which yielded the lowest death.rates from fever during the year. The table of Infectious sickness also shows a considerable decrease under the head of Fever compared with the two previous years, there being notified 15 cases of Enteric and 2 of Puerperal Fever. During the year 1897 45 cases were certified and for 1896 38 cases. Admissions and deaths at the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals, the Highgate Small.pox Hospital, and the London Fever Hospital of persons suffering from Small.pox, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria and Enteric Fever, 1889.1898 :— Years.

The deaths from this disease in London numbered 2,160, being equal to a death-rate of 0.48 per 1,000 living. The mean rate for the ten years 1888.97 having been 0.56 per 1,000. Compared with surrounding districts, St. Luke occupies a favourable position, our death-rate from Whooping Cough was 0.59; in Shoreditch, it was 0.81; Bethnal Green, 0.92; and in Limehouse, 1.06 per 1,000 living. This not being a notifiable disease, I am unable to state the amount of sickness due to it during the year. Measles.—For the same cause as that mentioned in respect to the last disease, the degree of prevalence of Measles can only be judged by the number of deaths ascribed to it, but it is satisfactory to note that it is credited with having caused only 37 deaths. The Registrar-General's Report shows that Measles was the certified cause of 3,075 deaths in the Metropolis, against 1,929 for 1897, and 3,697 for 1896, when it was attended with more fatal results than any previous year on record, with the exception of 1864. The Metropolitan death-rate of Measles last year was 0.68 per 1,000 as compared with 0.62, the decennial average rate. Influenza.—Ten deaths were ascribed to Influenza during the year against nine for the preceding year. The number of deaths in the Metropolis during 1898 numbered 1,283 against 679 for the year 1897, and although nearly double, was below the average for the preceding eight years. Phthisis.—In my last Annual Report I referred to the unenviable position occupied by St. Luke in the list of London sanitary districts with respect to deaths from phthisis. It is therefore gratifying to be able to say the returns for 1898 show a considerable improvement in this particular. The number of deaths which occurred in the Parish from the disease was 99; of which 55 took place in the Royal Hospital for Diseases of the Chest, and 52 being non-parishioners may be deducted. On the other hand, 59 parishioners died from the malady in Institutions outside the Parish, making a total of 106 deaths belonging to St. Luke; equal to a death.rate of 2.56 per 1,000 living, and bearing favourable comparison with the following districts:— Hulborn, 3.17 ; St. George's, Southwark, 3.18; Strand, 3.32; 12 St. Giles, Bloomsbury, 3.34 per 1,000.; while of the more favoured districts, Hampstead furnished 0.74, and Lewisham 0.88 per 1,000. That tuberculosis, which is the comprehensive name for all forms of tubercular disease, is infectious has now passed beyond the bounds of controversy; that it is due to the existence and propagation of a germ, microbe or bacillus is also an accepted fact; and that this propagation is favoured by unhealthy occupations and environment is clearly established, while heredity, which was formerly regarded as the most frequent cause, is now classed as of secondary importance. The principal diseases included in the term tuberculosis are phthisis, tubercular disease of the lungs or consumption, which alfects chiefly adults—[This is the most infectious form of the disease and is spread by the inhalation of air containing the Specific Bacilli, which, having been expectorated by persons suffering from the disease, become dried and pass into the atmosphere in the form of dust]—tabes mesenterica (consumption of the bowels), tubercular meningitis (inflammation of the membranes of the brain), and hydrocephalus (water on the brain), all of which manifest themselves in young children, to whom the bacillus or germ is conveyed by means of food—especially is this likely to occur in the case of milk obtained from cows suffering from tuberculous disease. But whether the cooked flesh of tuberculous animals is capable of conveying the disease is a very doubtful point. The question naturally arises as to what can be done to prevent the spread of tuberculosis, and it has been answered by the recently formed Association for the Prevention of Consumption and other Forms of Tuberculosis, the objects of which were stated, at a meeting held at Marlborough House at which H.R.H. the Prince of Wales presided, to be :— 1st.—To educate the public as to the means of preventing the spread of consumption from those already suffering from the disease; 2nd.—To extinguish tuberculosis in cattle ; and 3rd.—To promote the erection of Sanatoria for the open air treatment of tuberculous disease. At present the first of these appears to be the one to which your Vestry can most readily give practical effect by pointing out that Consumption is curable if proper means are adopted in 13 its early stages; that the conditions most favourable to the spread of the disease are dampness, dirt, insufficiently ventilated and overcrowded rooms and workplaces, intemperance, and the existence of diseases which lower the general health; by soliciting the co-operation of medical men and the friends of patients to notify its existence; by the disinfection of rooms in which persons have died of Phthisis or from which patients have been removed while suffering from that disease.* Great good can also be done by taking prompt measures to abate overcrowding, the removal of insanitary conditions generally, especially by improving the ventilation of work places, aud the admission of sunlight and fresh air in and about dwelling-houses. *Since writing the above your Vestry have, upon the recommendation of the Public Health Committee, sanctioned the following circular being sent to all medical men practising in the District :— VESTRY OF ST. LUKE, MIDDLESEX. Public Health Department. Vestry Hall, City Road, E.C. 9 Dear Sir, I have the satisfaction to inform you that the Vestry is now prepared, upon application being made at this office, to disinfect, free of charge, Rooms, Bedding, &c., of any Resident who has died from Phthisis, also Rooms which have been occupied by patients who have been removed while suffering from that disease, and the Vestry trust that in the interest of Public Health they will have your support in their effort to check the spread of this distressing disease.

For the year 1897 the sum of £57 3s. was paid. The Vestry is recouped for this expenditure by the Metropolitan Asylums Board (out of the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund), to which Board a copy of each certificate is sent within 12 hours of the receipt of the same. 28 Temporary Shelter. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, house accommodation, with necessary attendants, has been provided at 41, Macclesfield Street, where the members of any family in which any dangerous infectious disease has appeared, who are compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected, can be received. The premises are very conveniently situated and are furnished with all necessary domestic appliances, and although ready for use since Midsummer last only two families have been received into them—one of which remained 11 and the other 12 hours. Bye- Laws. At the date of my last Report three important subjects were occupying the consideration of your Public Health Committee, viz.:— First, the necessity for the amendment of the Bye-laws relating to houses let in lodgings or occupied by more than one family. Secondly, the desirability of increasing the number of your Sanitary Inspectors ; and Thirdly, the provision of further accommodation at the Mortuary. In reference to the first of these I may mention that the matter had been under the consideration of the Vestry from time to time since 1874, and Bye-laws were first made by the Vestry in 1884, but it was not found practical to put them in force, and as doing so was then permissive the subject was allowed to remain in abeyance until by the Public Health (London) Act the making and enforcing of the Bye-laws became compulsory. Fresh Bye-laws were adopted by the Vestry, September 3rd, 1895, and approved by the Local Government Board, October 29th following, but when put into operation were found to be inefficient in two particulars ; first, by reason of the rent limit (3s. per week), which prevented houses it was desirable to register, being so dealt with, while it embraced others with which it is not necessary to interfere. The second defect arose from the fact that before proceeding to deal with any premises under the Bye-laws a resolution of the 29 Vestry was required to the effect that it was necessary to do so, but the Vestry naturally declined to pass such resolution until they were furnished with the facts in each case, and which the officers had no authority to obtain. The subject of the alteration of these Bye-laws was considered by your Committee, November 10th, 1896, when it was resolved to recommend the Vestry to make alteratious in the direction referred to, but the Vestry declined to endorse the Committee's recommendation and the Bye-laws remained inoperative until Jannary, 1898, when the following Report and recommendation of your Committee was considered at a Special Meeting of the Vestry. "Resolved—To report to the Vestry that it has been found in practice that very few houses, if any, iu the Parish come within the operation of the existing Bye-laws, with reference to houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family ; and many houses in the Parish now exempted by reason of the rent paid by each lodger being larger than the amounts specified in Clause 2 (ii) and (iii) should be registered under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and to recommend the Vestry to take the necessary steps to make new Bye-laws under the Act, eliminating the provisions above referred to, as regards the amount of rent payable, and also the portion of the Bye-laws relating to the initial stage of the proceedings for carrying out the same." This recommendation having been approved and adopted, the subjoined Bye-laws were accepted by the Vestry in lieu of those at the time in force, and were duly forwarded to the Local Government Board for approval. In April, however, the Vestry Clerk reported the receipt of a letter from the Local Government Board returning the proposed regulations and suggesting that a limit of rental should be specified, it being in their opinion unreasonable to include within the scope of the Bve-laws every lodging-house with a non-resident landlord without reference to the circumstances of each case, and empowering the Committee to communicate to the Board the reason why the clauses specifying rental were eliminated by the Vestry. To this letter I subsubmitted the following Report:— "The existing Bye-laws were approved by the Local Government Board, October 29th, 1895, and were at once put into operation, but it soon became manifest that the objection of the owners of the class of property which it is desirable to register was so great as to cause all manner of schemes to be resorted to in order to 30 avoid them being so dealt with, in some cases in which the lettings were below 3s. per week, the rents were raised, either actually or nominally, to that amount; in others the number of rooms to a letting were increased, and the rent payable enabling them to evade registration. " Further, the rent limit Bye-law was found to act unfairly, by reason of the fact that houses came within its scope with which it was not necessary to interfere, while others it was desirable to register could not be so dealt with—for example: a single person occupying a room at 2s. 9d. per week made the whole house registerable, while the same sized room occupied by a family of 4 or 5 at 3s. per week escaped registration. "I find that the Bye-laws of the following Sanitary Authorities contain no rent limit—Shoreditch, St. Pancras, St. Giles, Kensington, and the Strand; in the latter case the omission was at first objected to by the Local Government Board, but was ultimately sanctioned. " In Stoke Newington the Bye-laws are stated to have failed, for the same reason as is ascribed to this Parish, viz., the low rent limit, and no houses are in consequence registed in that district. "The amount of rent prescribed by the Bye-laws of some other districts are, for unfurnished or furnished apartments respectively—in Camberwell, 5s. and 7s. 6d. ; St. George the Martyr, 7s. 6d. and l0s. 6d. ; City of London, 10s. to 12s. 6d. "Dealing with this subject in September of last year Mr. Shirley Murphy says:—In a few districts the rent of tenements, which excludes the houses from being subject to the Bye-laws, is so low as to militate against the usefulness of the Bye-laws, Camberwell, Hammersmith, Poplar, Rotherhithe, St. George'sin-the-East, St. Luke, Stoke Newington and Whitechapel may be mentioned in this respect. Indeed, in one or two of these districts, if the rental had been actually considered with this object, it would have been unnecessary to have adopted other than that incorporated in the Bye-laws ; in this connection may be mentioned St. Luke, Poplar and Stoke Newington. Recent enquiry by Dr. Young into the sanitary condition and administration of St. Luke, has led him to the conclusion that the majority of tenements needing regulation are exempted by the limits of rental specified in the Bye-laws. In Poplar and Stoke Newington, for the same reason, comparatively few houses could be regulated. 31 "With regard to Bye-law No. 5, which the Local Government Board think it desirable also to retain as it at present stands, I have already pointed out how it fails to work satisfactorily, viz., by reason of the fact that before proceeding to deal with any premises under the Byelaws, a resolution of the "Vestry is required to the effect that it is necessary to do so, and for this purpose the Vestry very naturally asks to be furnished with the facts in each case for their guidance. Mr. Preston, the Vestry Clerk, replies that he has received no instructions to serve the notice upon the landlord or owner to furnish the information required, so that a deadlock is the result. In reply to the suggestion that the proposed alterations would bring within the scope of the Byelaws every lodging-house with a non-resident landlord, without reference to the circumstances of the case, I may point out that in accordance with a resolution of the Vestry, the circumstance of every case must be submitted for the consideration of the Public Health Committee before a house can be put upon the register." This Report was approved by your Committee and a copy thereof forwarded to the Local Government Board in reply to their letter upon the subject, the result being that in October last the Board confirmed the Bye-laws as proposed, and the obstacles hitherto in the way of carrying out this portion of the Public Health Act were removed, and before the close of the year preliminary steps were taken to place 200 houses upon the register, and the number of cases of over-crowding were markedly decreased thereby. Bye-Laws. Made by the Vestry of the Parish of St. Luke, Middlesex, in the Administrative County of London, being the Sanitary Authority for the said Parish, with respect to Houses let in Lodgings, or occupied by Members of more than one Family.

The landlord of a lodging-house shall, in the first week of the month of April in every year, cause every part of the premises to be cleansed. He shall at the same time, except in such cases as are hereinafter specified, cause every area, the interior surface of every ceiling, and wall of every water-closet belonging to the premises, and the interior surface of every ceiling and wall of every room, staircase, and passage in the house to be thoroughly lime-washed. Provided that the foregoing requirement with respect to the limewashing of the internal surface of the walls of rooms, staircases, and passages shall not apply in any case where the internal surface of any such wall is painted, or where the material of or with which such surface is constructed or covered is such as to render the lime-washing thereof unsuitable or inexpedient, and where such surface is thoroughly cleansed, and the paint or other covering is renewed, if the renewal thereof be necessary for the purpose of keeping the premises in a cleanly and wholesome condition. 16. The landlord of a lodging-house shall provide adequate means of ventilation in or in connection with every common passage or staircase in such house, and shall cause such means of ventilation to be maintained at all times in good order. 17. The landlord of a lodging-house shall cause all such means of ventilation as may be provided in or in connection with any room in such house to be maintained at all times in good order. 18. In every case where, in pursuance of any statutory provision in that behalf, an order of a justice has been obtained for the removal from a lodging-house to a hospital of a person who is suffering from any dangerous infectious disease and is without proper lodging or accommodation, the landlord of such house, and the lodger to whom any room whereof such person may be an occupant has been let shall, on being informed of such order, forthwith take all such steps as may be requisite on the part of such landlord and of such lodger respectively, to secure the safe and prompt removal of such person in compliance with such order, and shall, in and about such removal, adopt all such precautions as, in accordance with any instructions 36 which such landlord and such lodger, respectively, may receive from the Medical Officer of Health of the Sanitary Authority, may be most suitable for the circumstances of the case. Penalties. 19. Every person who shall offend against any of the foregoing Bye-laws shall be liable for every such offence to a penalty of five pounds, and in the case of a continuing offence to a further penalty of forty shillings for each day after written notice of the offence from the Sanitary Authority : Provided, nevertheless, that the justices or court before whom any complaint may be made or any proceedings may be taken in respect of any such offence may, if they think fit, adjudge the payment as a penalty of any sum less than the full amount of the penalty imposed by this bye-law. Repeal of Bye-laws. From and after the date of the confirmation of these Bye-laws the regulations as to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, which were made by the Sanitary Authority on the tenth day of September, in the year one thousand eight hundred and ninety-five, and were confirmed by the Local Government Board on the twenty-ninth day of October in the same year, shall be repealed. The Seal of the Vestry of the Parish of Saint Luke, Middlesex, in the Administrative County of London, affixed by Order dated the 22nd day of July, 1898. L.S. (Signed) ENOS HOWES, Chairman of the Vestry. G. W. PRESTON, Clerk of the Vestry. Allowed by the Local Government Board this eleventh day of October, 1898. L.S. (Signed) HUGH OWEN, Secretary, Acting on behalf of the said Board under the authority of their General Order, dated the 26th day of May, 1877. 37 The necessity for the appointment of an additional Sanitary Inspector was emphasized by the adoption of the foregoing Byelaws, and the further recommendation of your Committee to appoint a third Inspector was duly passed by the Vestry and became an accomplished fact about the middle of November, from which time the services of Mr. H. E. Cox, the Officer appointed, have been mainly directed to the registration of houses let in lodgings, attention in the first instance being given to such as contain more than three families, and, as already stated, the inspections and enquiries necessitated by these proceedings have bad the effect of discovering and dealing with a much larger number of cases of overcrowding than had before been brought under observation of the Public Health Department. The third matter to which the London County Council directed the attention of the Vestry was the necessity for further accommodation at the Mortuary belonging to the Parish, whereby provision should be made for the reception of the bodies of persons who have died of infectious disease other than in the general Mortuary ; this has been met by dividing off from the general Mortuary (which was unnecessarily large) a separate chamber for depositing the cases referred to, until removal for burial. Use of Peat Moss as Litter. The right of the Vestry to require provision being made for the drainage of all stables, regardless of the nature of the litter used for bedding the horses, has been called in question during the year, and in one instance the notice to carry out the Vestry's requirements was resisted up to a certain point. The Public Health Committee, while satisfied that the Vestry possessed full powers to enforce compliance with their notice, resolved, that in view of the importance of the subject, to obtain the Vestry's sanction to take Counsel's opinion on the matter, with the following result:— Question 1.—Whether, under the provisions of Section 75 of the Metropolis Management Act, 18 and 19 Vic., Cap. 120, the Vestry can compel the building owner to drain the building in question? Answer.—I am of opinion that the Vestry can compel the building owner to provide a drain or drains for the building in question. Section 75 provides that it shall not be lawful to erect any building unless a drain be constructed of 38 such materials, size, &c., as the Vestry may direct. This Section applies to a stable, which is a " building," but it does not itself provide how the duty created by it is to be enforced. Section 76 provides that, before beginning to erect any building, seven days' notice shall be given to the Vestry, who are required within seven days (or fifteen days, if advantage is taken of 25 and 26 Vic., Cay. 102, Sec. 63), to make their order in relation to the details of the drain. If the Vestry make an order, it may be enforced under the Section, but, if they do not, Section 76 does not apply, and recourse must be had to Section 73, which enables the Vestry to require a drain to be provided for any building which has no drain, and enables the Vestry to prescribe the details of the construction of the drain. Question 2.—Having regard to the fact that Mr. Allen's stabling is now nearly finished, and fit for occupation, and no drainage has been effected, what course it would be desirable for the Vestry to take, having regard to the provisions of Section 76 of the same Act? Answer.—The answer to this question depends upon whether the Vestry did or did not notify to Mr. Allen, within the prescribed time, their order under Section 76. If they did not, they cannot proceed under that Section; if they did, they have a remedy under the Section; or they may proceed for penalties under 25 and 26 Vic., Cap. 102, Sec. 64. But, in any case, as already stated, they may take proceedings under Section 73. I could advise more definitely as to the course to be followed if I were informed precisely of what the Vestry have already done. Question 3.—Are not the Vestry correct in the view that the Bye-laws can only be enforced when the buildings are used as stabling? Answer.—I think the Vestry are right in the view they take of the Bye-laws. Until the buildings are actually used for the keeping of horses the Bye-laws cannot apply. But as soon as the stables are used the Vestry may enforce the Bye-laws by proceeding for penalties thereunder. Disinfection of Infected Articles. Dr. Thresh's Current Steam Disinfector continues to act very isfactorily, the number of articles disinfected by it during the 39 year amounted to 7,764; included in which is 2,000 articles disinfected for Clerkenwell and Shoreditch Vestries during short periods, while their own apparatus were undergoing repairs. The number of rooms fumigated after the occurrence of cases of infectious sickness amounted to 442. Supply of Disinfectants. 657 persons were supplied with Carbolic Acid and Disinfecting Powder from the Mortuary upon presentation of orders for the same issued from this department. The Mortuary and Coroner s Court. During the twelve months under consideration 265 bodies have been received into the Mortuary. 71 Inquests were held in the Coroner's Court belonging to the Vestry, and 47 Post-mortem Examinations were made in the Post-mortem Room adjoining the Court. By arrangement with the Loudon County Council the sum of £50 per annum is now received by the Vestry for the accommodation afforded by the Coroner's Court in lieu of payment by fees as was wont to be the case. The following is a list of the fines and costs incurred under the several Acts, also the nature and amount of adulteration where analyses were made:— Fines. Costs.

Besides those already mentioned, 1 have made numerous Reports to your Public Health Committee on the various matters which have occupied its attention, and twice during the year I have visited and reported upon four slaughter-houses, two cowsheds, and 34 bakehouses situated in the Parish, with the result that notices to cleanse, whitewash and remedy other sanitary defects were served upon the owners of one cowshed, one slaughterhouse and 25 bakehouses. I have also visited 126 dwelling-houses, factories and workshops of which complaints were received, and in every instance in which the Vestry's notice has not been complied with, and in such cases in which summonses have been granted I have attended the police court in support of the same. In conclusion I beg to tender my best thanks to the Public Health Committee and the Vestry for the continued confidence reposed in me and the officers under my charge ; also to express my appreciation of the assistance afforded me in carrying out the ofttimes onerous duties of the position I have the honour to fill. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, G. E. YARROW, M.D., D.P.H., &c. Vestry Hall, City Road, April 18th, 1899 42 Sanitary Inspectors' Report. To Dr. Yarrow, Medical Officer of Health. Sir, We beg to present the following report of our work in the Public Health Department during the year ending December 31st, 1898 :— Premises inspected 2624 Re-inspections made for following-up work 8865 Houses cleansed and repaired 721 Dustbins provided and repaired 262 Yards and areas to houses paved and amended 821 Traps provided to yard and house drains 284 Water receptacles cleansed and provided with covers 150 Water supply re-instated 18 Drains amended and obstructions removed 383 Premises provided with new pipe drains 271 Rain-water pipes disconnected from drains 95 Waste pipes to sinks disconnected from drains 90 Water-closets re-constructed 165 ,, water supply re-instated207 ,, soilpipes re-instated and ventilated 102 ,, pans cleansed 178 Overcrowding in rooms abated 118 Use of underground rooms illegally occupied discontinued 19 Roofs, guttering and rain-water pipes repaired 240 Nuisances arising from accumulations of manure and refuse abated 60 Dungpits abolished and proper receptacles provided 6 Damp walls remedied 23 Animals kept so as to be a nuisance abated 21 Cesspools abolished 5 Cisterns abolished and water provided direct from main 20 Miscellaneous nuisances 111 Rooms fumigated 442 Sets of bedding and clothing, &c., disinfected 402 Dust accumulations reported to Scavenging Department 131 In all cases in which infectious diseases have been notified the premises have been promptly inspected, and any defective sanitary arrangements have been put in order. 43 List of Streets and Courts inspected under systematic houseto-house visitation:— Honduras Street Beckford Square Bath Buildings Hatfield Street Coleman's Buildings Memel Street Domingo Street Murton Street Royley Street Wellesley Street Gastigny Place Young's Buildings Collingwood Street Powell Street President Street Rahere Street Europia Place President Place Anchor Yard Lever Street Macclesfield Place Norman's Buildings Baldwin Street Lizard Street Elizabeth Place Baltic Street Dean's Court New Street Norway Street Waterloo Street Radsworth Street Wither's Place Pigeon Court Westmoreland Place King Square Goswell Road President Mews Mason's Place Moreland Street Mitchell Street Parr's Place Garden Row Bastwick Street Pickard Street Ludlow Streel Thirty-four bakehouses, two cowsheds and four slaughterhouses were visited, notices were served for cleansing, limewhiting, &c., where necessary, and the work done in all cases. Factory and Workshops Act, 1895, and Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Under the above-mentioned Acts a systematic inspection is being carried on, and special attention being paid to the provision of proper and suitable sanitary conveniences to the factories and workshops in the Parish. We are pleased to state that as a rule we find the employers are very willing to carry out the necessary improvements when their attention is directed to the same. 44 The following shows the work done in this direction during the year:— Number of visits to workshops 838 ,, workrooms inspected 913 ,, ,, requiring limewashing 468 ,, ,, satisfactory 445 ,, defective drains founds in workshops 49 ,, foul water-closets and urinals 160 ,, additional water-closets required 80 ,, water-closets re-constructed 131 ,, workrooms measured 60 ,, ,, found overcrowded 10 Number requiring additional ventilation 75 Number of references to Her Majesty's Inspector of Factories relating to overcrowding, young persons, and dangerous machinery 85 Number notified as having no provision for fire escape 13 Number of proceedings taken for non-compliance with notice to cleanse workshops 1 Sanitary Notices Served during the Year. Written intimations 1794 Statutory Notices 696 Notices of Summons 118 London County Council Bye-laws. A large number of new buildings have been erected and alterations to existing buildings carried out in the Parish during the year, and in many instances we have had to call the builders' attention to infringements of the above Bye-laws. In two cases the Public Health Committee considered it necessary to take proceedings, but these were stayed on the Bye-laws being complied with and on payment of costs. Various alterations to sanitary fittings were carried out (without notice having been given to the Vestry), and upon proceedings being threatened by the Public Health Committee, apologies were tendered by the offenders, which, with an undertaking not to repeat the offence, were accepted. Inspection of Food, &c. The meat, fish and frnit exposed for sale, and as far as possible that in course of preparation for sale in Whitecross Street and 45 other parts of the Parish, has been kept under observation, and the following have been destroyed as being unfit for food:— 5 tons 15 cwt. bacon and hams. 1½ cwt. of beef. 3 lungs. 1 cwt. of bullocks cheeks. 20 lbs of hearts, feet and kidneys. 1 barrel of fish. 4½ bushels of apples. 37 lbs. of tomatoes. 70 lbs. of mutton. 84 lbs. of pork. 2 livers. 62 lbs. pigs' plucks. 20 lbs. of sausage meat. 12 boxes of oranges. 10 lbs. of plums. 4 hogsheads of pickles. Sale of Food and Drugs and Margarine Acts. This year 258 samples of food and drugs have been taken for analysis, and the following table shows the number of each article, and the cases in which proceedings were ordered, with the fines and costs inflicted:— Articles submitted to Public Analyst.

The greater number of the proceedings during the year have been under the Margarine Act, and we regret that selling Margariue for Butter in the Parish is very prevalent. There are so many loopholes in the Margarine Act, and the fines are so infinitesimal generally, that we feel convinced it will never be put a stop to unless the Legislature makes a provision in the new Act compelling manufacturers to use a distinctive colour for Margarine or forbid the use of any colouring matter at all. In the United States the law compels manufacturers to colour it pink, and in France it is not allowed to be coloured at all with the exception of that manufactured for export. Recently the Magistrate at Clerkenwell held that Margarine on a slab on the counter (although it was visible to the purchaser standing in front of the counter) was not. exposed for sale within the meaning of the Act, giving as his reason that he was bound by a decision some nine years old (Crane v. Lawrence) where the Margarine was not visible to the purchaser. The Magistrate expressed himself very strongly on this point of law, suggesting that the Vestry had a good case to go to the High Court with, and he would willingly state a case, as he was of opinion that the Divisional Court was wrong. Again, it is the custom with some of the shopkeepers to use a Margarine wrapper for both Butter and Margarine and enclose the purchase in a bag. This practically defeats the Act, as persons asking to he served with Butter do not become aware of the fact that they have been served with Margarine at a Butter price, and the fraud is not discovered until they unwrap the purchase some time after iu their homes. Milk. It is the custom with a few of the milkmen in the Parish that whenever your Inspectors purchase samples of milk for analysis to declare it is sold as milk and water so as to save themselves from a prosecution. In one case milk sold under this title proved to have as much as fifty per cent. of added water although there is not the least doubt it would be sold as the pure and unadulterated article to any one else. 47 As the Vestry's Solicitor has given it as his opinion that no proceedings conld he taken there is great need of an alteration of the law in this respect. The difficulty of obtaining a sample of this milk in the ordinary way being that it is only sold in small quantities, such as farthing worths and halfpennyworths, as purchased by the poorer class. This quantity is not sufficient for analysis when divided into three parts as required by the Act, and therefore the vendors cannot be reached. If a larger quantity is asked for a different article is sold. We are, Sir, Yours obediently, A. W. MARTIN, R. ADAMS, H. E. COX. Canal Boats Acts, 1877 and 1884. The following particulars are submitted, showing the number of boats inspected and re-inspected during the year at the various wharves on the City Road basin, there beiug very little waterway within the St. Luke's sanitary area, and, no traffic passing through. The Inspections under these Acts are included in the Inspector's duties for the District in which the canal is situate.
