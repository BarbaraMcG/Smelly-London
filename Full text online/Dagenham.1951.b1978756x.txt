Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, In presenting my report on the health of Dagenham for the year 1951, I would again invite your attention to the fact that much of the report deals with the services which are administered by the Local Health Authority through the Health Area SubCommittee. With a view to making the report informative the services affecting the health of the Borough are discussed without discriminating between the Authorities ultimately responsible for them. The birth and death rates approximate very closely to those of the previous year, there being 44 fewer births in the current year and an increase of 41 deaths of residents. This is to be expected as the population becomes stabilised and the average age thereby increases. The death rate however is still below that of the country as a whole. The crude death rate for Dagenham was 7.42 but in order to compare this with the rate for England and Wales, the comparability factor of 1.64 must be applied which gives the figure of 12.16. The comparable rate for the 126 County Boroughs and Great Towns (including London) is 13.4. The uncorrected birth rate was 15.25, the corrected rate 14.48, this is less than that for the Great Towns which was 17.3. The infant mortality rate was 30.08, that for the Great Towns was 33.9 and for England and Wales 29.6. MATERNAL DEATHS. I regret to have to report that one maternal death occurred. The patient was apparently a healthy woman and had been regularly examined at the ante-natal clinic and the usual laboratory tests were applied and revealed no abnormality. Furthermore, the patient co-operated intelligently throughout the pregnancy and during the labour. The services of the obstetric emergency unit were invoked and were in operation within a matter of minutes of being called. As there was no clear indication of the cause of death the Coroner was informed and an autopsy performed by a Pathologist. The findings showed that there was early rheumatic involvement of the mitral valve of the heart and gross oedema and congestion of both lungs with scanty sub-pleural haemorrhages. One of my colleagues and I searched the literature and as a result were of the opinion that death was probably due to pulmonary 4 embolism by amniotic fluid. This is a rare condition which is stated to have occurred in one in 8,000 obstetric cases over a period of nine years at the Chicago Lying-in Hospital. As far as is known this obstetric emergency is unpredictable and therefore when it does supervene death will be inevitable. INFANT WELFARE CENTRES. The Regional Hospital Board have decided to adapt the Out-Patient Department of King George Hospital for use as a Chest Clinic to serve Dagenham. This has necessitated the removal of the clinic formerly held at this hospital to other premises and for the time being will occasion some inconvenience to mothers living in that vicinity. Provision, however, is made by holding additional sessions at other clinics and negotiations have been taking place to establish an Infant Welfare Centre in close proximity to Five Elms. The clinic held at the London City Mission Hall, Dagenham Road, has been fully attended and an additional session has been arranged in order to meet the needs. CARAVANS. Further applications for land in the Northern part of the Borough to be used as sites fo caravans were received. All were refused in view of the inability to provide satisfactory sanitary facilities. One appeal against the Council's decision was dismissed by the Magistrates' Court. In co-operation with the Town Planning Authority, a general policy has been adopted whereby applications in respect of individual vans will only be granted in the unsewered Northern are. where the applicant submits plans for a permanent dwelling to be erected (when a building licence is obtained) on the site. It was mentioned in my report for last year that an adjoining Borough was extending and modernising its mortuary. This work has now been completed and when the notice to the Borough, with whom Dagenham has now entered into arrangements, expires, the facilities offered by the first-mentioned local authority will be accepted. MORTUARY. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT. This Act came into operation on the 1st November, 1951, and two premises where filling materials are used have been registered. One licence was issued to a manufacturer of rag flock and one for the storage of this material. A sample of rag flock, manufactured from new materials only, consisting of coloured and bleached offcuts from a clothing factory, 5 All charges for the use of public con' veniences in the Borough have now been abolished, with the exception of facilities for persons who desire to use the private wash-room which includes the use of brush, comb and towels for which a charge of 2d. is made. This is a matter of some importance and should contribute to the public health of the district. Formerly, all persons using the water-closet were exhorted to wash their hands immediately after doing so which might have been embarrassing financially for some people. I wish to record this advance made in public health practice by this Borough and express the hope that less enlightened sanitary authorities will emulate Dagenham. All conveniences are now open day and night and are provided with running hot and cold water. At the three attended conveniences electric hand-driers have been installed and gas incinerators have been installed in the women's section. I record once more my grateful thanks to the officers and members of the staff for their continued efficiency and loyalty. In conclusion, I express my deep appreciation to the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen and Members of the Committees chiefly concerned for their support and interest in the promotion of preventive medicine in Dagenham. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, CECIL HERINGTON, D Medical Officer of Health. Public Health Department, Civic Centre, Dagenham. PUBLIC CONVENIENCES. contained 34 parts per 100,000 of chlorine (the Act prescribes a maximum of 30 parts per 100,000). It was considered that the condition was due to the presence of certain dyes in the coloured material and arrangements were made for all new material to be washed. A subsequent sample of rag flock manufactured from washed new material was found to contain 51 parts per 100,000 of chlorine. Softened water (the apparatus was re-generated with salt) was used at a laundry where the rag flock was washed and this was considered the probable source of the trouble. 6 MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL (31st December, 1951) Mayor : Councillor J.

Since November, 1938, eight local authorities in the South Essex Waterworks Company's area of supply have carried out a co-ordinated system of sampling. During the year two chemical and two bacteriological samples were taken from the Company's mains in this Borough and all were satisfactory. The water is not liable to have plumbo-solvent properties, and no action was called for in respect of any form of contamination. Approximately .059 per cent. of the inhabited houses and .032 per cent. of the population of the Borough take their water from standpipes. During the year the mains laid in the Borough were as follows:â€” Location Diameter Length Woodlands Estate 4" 447 yards Cranmer Road 4" 119 â€ž Whalebone Lane South 4" 48 â€ž Total 614 â€ž 471 supplies were afforded to houses during the year. The Chief Engineer of the South Essex Waterworks Company has furnished me with the following report:â€” "Bacteriological and chemical examinations are made of the raw river water, of the water in its various stages of treatment and of the water going into supply and of both raw and chlorinated water from the Company's wells. Analyses are also made of samples obtained from consumers' taps in the various parts of the Company's district and all proved to be satisfactory. Over 3,500 chemical, bacteriological and biological examinations have been made during the year. All water going into supply was wholesome." 19 FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 & 1948 Inspections.

Bacteriological Sampling of Milk During the year 84 samples of milk were submitted for examination and two were found to be unsatisfactory. When The Milk (Special Designations) (Specified Areas) Order, 1951 came into force on the 1st October, the use of special designations for retail sales of milk in the Borough became compulsory. This meant that all milk sold by retail must be Pasteurised, Accredited, Tuberculin-Tested or Sterilised. Three small retailers had certain adjustments to make to comply with the Order. Ice Cream Bacteriological Sampling. During the year 44 samples of ice cream were submitted for analysis and three were found to be unsatisfactory. Registration of Premises. During the year seven applications for the storage and sale of ice cream were granted. In all cases the provision on the premises of running hot water is required. Where conditions are not considered altogether satisfactory for the sale of loose ice cream registration has been restricted to the storage and sale of ice cream "contained in containers of such materials and so closed as to exclude all risk of contamination." An itinerant vendor was summoned and convicted for selling ice cream with a fat content of only 3.7% (the minimum was 5%). 21 FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1938 Analyses Article Number Examined Number Adulterated, etc. Formal Informal Formal Informal Almonds, Ground 1 - - - Blanc Mange Powder 1 1 â€” â€” Bread â€” 7 â€” 7 Bread Roll â€” 1 â€” 1 Cake 1 3 â€” 3 Cake Mixture 4 2 â€” â€” Cayenne, Powdered â€” 1 â€” â€” Cherries, Glace 1 â€” â€” â€” Cocktails 3 â€” â€” â€” Cocoa and Malt Preparation â€” 1 â€” â€” Coconut, Dessicated and Sweetened 1 1 â€” â€” Coffee 1 1 â€” â€” Coffee and Chicory Essence 1 1 â€” â€” Condiment, non-brewed 1 1 â€” 1 Cream, Synthetic â€” 1 â€” â€” Culinary Oil â€” 1 â€” â€” Custard Powder 3 1 â€” â€” Dessert Powder â€” 1 â€” â€” Egg Roll â€” 1 â€” 1 Flour Mixture â€” 1 â€” â€” Frying Oil 2 â€” â€” â€” Gelatine 1 3 â€” â€” Ginger â€” 2 â€” â€” Herbs, Dried â€” 3 â€” â€” Ice Cream 1 16 1 1 Jellies 4 9 â€” - Lemon Juice â€” 1 â€” â€” Lemonade Crystals and Powder â€” 3 â€” â€” Lime Juice Cordial 1 â€” â€” - Medicinal Samples 9 4 â€” - Milk 40 â€” 2 - Milk Whipping Compound â€” 1 â€” â€” Mint 1 â€” â€” - Nutmeg, Ground - 1 â€” - Olive Oil 1 4 â€” - Onion Powder, Dehydrated â€” 1 â€” â€” Orangeade Crystals - 1 - - 22 Analysesâ€”continued.
