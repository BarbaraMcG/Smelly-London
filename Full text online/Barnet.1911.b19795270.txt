MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. HEALTH DEPARTMENT, 40, High Street, Barnet. January, 1912. To the Chairman and Members of the Barnet Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I beg to present my second Annual Report on the Health of the District for the year 1911. The District is in the Barnet Union, and includes the parishes of Chipping Barnet, Hadley, South Mimms, and Arkley, and has an area of 1,509 acres. The Town, locally known as High Barnet, stands upon a hill at an altitude of 430 feet above sea level. The geological formation consists of gravel overlying beds of London clay upon the hill, while in the valleys the clay comes to the surface. The Town is situated about 10 miles from Charing Cross on what may be termed the crowning summit of the Northern Heights. The District is bracing and healthy, and is becoming an increasingly popular residential area. POPULATION. The census taken during the year gives the population as 10,440. This is lower than was estimated owing to the fact that the increase in the decennial period 1901 to 1911 has been at a lower rate than during the period 1891 to 1901, due to a decrease in the Birth Rate. The average number of persons per house in 1911 was 4'7, as compared with 5'2 in 1901. 6 The following table shows the number of inhabited houses, together with the population for each parish at the census. Parish No. of Occupied Houses. Population. Arkley 137 494 Chipping Barnet 800 3,954 Hadley 93 439 South Mimms 1172 5,553 DENSITY OF POPULATION. The District has an area of 1,509 acres. The census of 1911 showed the average number of persons to the acre to be 6'9, as compared with 5'5 in 1901. The following is the density of population of each parish in the District:— Parish. Area in Acres. Population. Density per Acre. Arkley 830 494 0.6 Chipping Barnet 379 3,954 10.4 Hadley 27 439 16.2 South Mimms 272 5,553 205 BIRTH RATE. The nett number of births registered in the District during the year was 224, as compared with 217 in 1910, and 214 in 1909. Of these births, 120 were male and 104 female. The Birth Rate, calculated as the rate per 1,000 of the population, is 21 "3, as compared with 19'4 in the previous year. The nett illegitimate births registered give a proportion of 31 per 1,000 of the total births. The following table shows the number of births recorded and the Birth Rate for each parish in the District:— Parish. No. of Births. Birth Rate. Arkley 8 160 Chipping Barnet 78 19'5 Hadley 11 250 South Mimms 127 22'9 DEATH RATE. 182 Deaths were registered in the District during the past year, as compared with 128 in 1910, and 166 in 1909. 7 This gives a crude Death Rate of 17.3 per 1,000 of the population living at all ages, based upon the census returns for the District. Two deaths of residents belonging to the District occurred in Public Institutions outside the District, while 71 deaths not belonging to the District occurred in Public Institutions within the District. After making allowance for these deaths a nett Death Rate of 10.6 per 1,000 is obtained. Number of deaths of persons not belonging to the District occurring in Public Institutions inside the District:— The Workhouse 60 Victoria Cottage Hospital 9 Isolation Hospital 2 Other Nil. Total 71 Number of deaths of persons belonging to the District occurring in Public Institutions outside the District:— Herts County Asylum 1 Middlesex County Asylum Nil. Other 1 Total 2 The following table gives the gross and nett Death Rates for each parish within the District:— Parish. Gross Death Rate. Corrected Death Rate. Arkley 80 8.0 Chipping Barnet 35.5* 12.7 Hadley 11.3 11.3 South Mimms 8.7 10.1 *Union Workhouse in this parish. INFANTILE MORTALITY. The rate of Infantile Mortality for the past year was 98 per 1,000, as compared with 60 during 1910, and 140 during 1909. The average for the past 10 years has been 101 per 1,000. It is calculated upon the ratio of infant deaths to births per 1,000. 8 The notification of Births Act, 1907, has not been adopted in this District, Infantile Mortality is due to a number of causes, the chief of which are:— Alcoholism; impure food supplies and contamination of infants' food by dust, flies, &c.; improper feeding; impure milk; insanitary environment and overcrowding ; and ante-natal causes. The housing of the working classes is intimately associated with the question of Infantile Mortality, owing to the fact that young infants are peculiarly susceptible to overcrowded and insanitary conditions. The hot dry summer of the past year has been associated with an unusual prevalence of infantile diarrhoea throughout the whole country. This District was not excepted, and a large number of young children were affected. There were only 3 deaths directly due to this cause. The improvement in the housing conditions is no doubt partly responsible for this, and the further provision of suitable cottages will tend to reduce still more the number of deaths. VITAL STATISTICS FOR 10 YEARS. 1901 — 1911. Appended is given in tabulated form the lates for births, deaths, etc., in Barnet for the past year as compared with the mean average for Barnet for the 10 years 1901-11, and also the mean average for Urban districts in the County during the same period.

ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The number of deaths from diseases of this class was 6, as compared with 3 in the previous year. 9 Of this number two deaths (Diphtheria) do not belong to the district. The number of cases of Infectious Diseases notified during 1911 was 54, being an increase of 23 over 1910. After an exceptional freedom from Zymotic Disease during the spring and summer, Scarlet Fever was prevalent in the early autumn. This appears to have been the experience of surrounding districts. The following table shows the number of notifications to the Sanitary Authority during the year of each disease specified in the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, and the number removed to Hospital:— Nature of Infectious Disease. Notified. Removed to Hospital. Small-pox .. .. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup 12 10 Erysipelas 5 1* Scarlet Fever 37 32 Typhoid or Enteric Fever .. .. Typhus Fever .. .. Relapsing Fever .. .. Continued Fever .. .. Puerperal Fever .. .. Total 51 43 *Removed to London Hospital. WATER SUPPLY. The District is supplied with water from the mains of the Barnet Water Company. The water is derived from deep wells sunk into the chalk, situate—1 at East Barnet, 3 at New Barnet, 1 at Potters Bar, and 1 at Tyttenhanger, Colney Heath. The buildings and machinery in connection with the latter well were completed during the year, and the well has been in use since the summer. The water supply of Barnet is improving, and it may now be said to be practically constant. Cisterns supplying houses still continue to receive attention, in order to secure their protection from contamination. 10 DISPOSAL OF HOUSE REFUSE. The House Refuse is collected weekly by the Council's own staff. There being no refuse destructor in the District the refuse is conveyed to the Farm. SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE. The town is sewered and drained on the separate system. The sewage is conveyed to an Irrigation Farm of 56 acres. The scheme of sewage disposal adopted by the Council for the better treatment of the sewage is not yet begun, but the contract is let, and the work will shortly be in hand. The method of treatment adopted arranges for the use of mechanical sprinklers; the effluent to be turned on to the land before being discharged into the brook. Mr. Fairley, Victoria Street, Westminster, is the engineer for the scheme. SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The Slaughter Houses continue to receive attention by the Sanitary Inspector, who possesses the special qualification as Inspector of Meat and Other Foods, issued by the Royal Sanitary Institute. This qualification is now urged by the Local Government Board in their memorandum as to Annual Reports, who require information upon the subject. JOINT ISOLATION HOSPITAL. This Hospital is controlled by a Joint Committee of the Barnet, East Barnet Valley Urban, and Barnet Rural District Councils. The accommodation is for 8 cases of Scarlet Fever, 4 of Diphtheria, and 4 of Enteric Fever. The percentage of cases notified which have been removed to Hospital is 79 per cent., as compared with 80 per cent. last year. Owing to the prevalence of Scarlet Fever in the Hospital area, there has been in some cases delay in obtaining admission to the Hospital. The Hospital still urgently needs discharge, observation, and convalescent wards. The provision of these wards, together with the advisability of making all new additions of a permanent character, is receiving the earnest consideration of the Hospital Committee. 11 Antitoxin is provided free to all practitioners in the District. The Council have also made arrangements to examine and report, through the Clinical Research Association, on all suspected cases of Diphtheria and Typhoid Fever. The Equifex Steam Disinfector is available for all hospital and private patients' bedding. PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. There are six schools in the district, viz.:—Arkley C.E. Infants' School; Barnet C.E., with Boys', Girls' and Infants' Departments; Barnet C.C. School, with Boys' and Girls' Departments; Christ Church School, with Boys', Girls' and Infants' Departments ; Hadley Infants' School; Moxon St. Infants' School. The following schools have been closed on account of outbreaks of Infectious Disease:— School. Period of Closure. Nature of Disease. Byng Road C.C. Schools 2 weeks Scarlet Fever Christ Church Boys', Girls' and Infants' 2 weeks Scarlet Fever Arkley Infants' 3 weeks Measles Christ Church Infants' 2 weeks Measles PUBLIC HEALTH (TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS. The extension of compulsory notification to all cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis should prove a very valuable means of controlling the spread of the disease, and of obtaining reliable data as to its prevalence, duration and course. Appliances are provided for the use of any poor person affected, and leaflets of instruction and advice given. Twenty-nine notifications have been received under the provisions of the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908, of which number 22 were from the Medical Officer of the Poor Law Infirmary and 7 from the Poor Law District Officer. In 5 instances the same patient was notified twice. It is difficult to see how this repeated notification can be avoided, as a patient may be discharged from an Institution one week and return the next. Therefore instead of 29 cases, as at first appears, the true number of cases is 24. The following gives particulars with regard to the cases. 12 13 PUBLIC HEALTH (TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS, 1908.

The following information regarding Vaccination in the district has been supplied by the Vaccination Officer :— Return of Vaccinations and Statutory Declarations of objection to Vaccination in the Barnet Urban District, received by the Vaccination Officer during the year ended 31st December, 1911 :— No. of Cases. 1911. 1910. Certificates of successful vaccination of Children under the age of 14 years 126 103 Statutory Declaration of Conscientious Objection to Vaccination 67 67 The above return does not include re-vaccinations or primary vaccinations of persons above the age of 14 years, no reliable figures relating thereto being available. The increasing number of children, particularly amongst the poorer classes, who are unprotected by vaccination constitute a serious danger. NOTES UPON SANITARY WORK. Twenty-four houses have been condemned as unfit for human habitation during the year. The Council has erected 30 cottages to provide housing accommodation for the working classes of the district. These cottages were let as soon as they were completed, and it is proved that a necessity for them existed in the district. An additional number of slightly larger houses are to be immediately erected, to be followed by a number of smaller ones, letting at about 4/- to 5/- per week. A fuller report upon the scheme vvill be found in the report of the Sanitary Inspector. A number of drains have been reconstructed, and the work has been well supervised. All cases of infectious disease have been thoroughly investigated, and the houses disinfected. Workshops, slaughterhouses, cowsheds, dairies, and bakehouses have also been inspected during the year, and steps taken to secure compliance with the Acts in force referring to them. 15 HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890.

THIRD ANNUAL REPORT of the SANITARY INSPECTOR, for the Year ending 31st December, 1911. 30 Barnet Urban District Council. SANITARY INSPECTOR'S REPORT. HEALTH DEPARTMENT. 40, High Street, Barnet. January, 1912. To the Chairman and Members of the Barnet Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour of presenting to you my Third Annual Report, giving particulars of the works carried out in my Department during the year 1911, in administering the numerous Health Acts and Bye-laws in force within the district. The innumerable extra duties continually devolving upon the Health Department of the Local Authority, more especially during the past two years, both in regard to the Medical and Sanitary work, including as they do the carrying out of the provisions of a number of Acts of Parliament and Orders of the Local Government Board dealing with fresh branches of sanitary science, which it is incumbent upon the Local Authority to administer compulsorily, combined with progressive changes embracing more extensive and rigid general health conditions than in the past, have rendered it imperative that if the benefits to be derived from these measures are to be substantial, a proper system must be evolved whereby each branch of the work can be dealt with at more regular intervals. The increased Inspectorial work must of necessity carry with it increased clerical work, which, together with the ever increasing statistical requirements of the Local Government Board, takes up a considerable amount of time. 31 However, attempt will be made to carry out the requirements of these numerous Acts upon a system which will have for its object the specialising in each branch of the work at regular intervals. If the investigations of general sanitary conditions, which are of an urgent character, allow of such a system to be attained, no doubt it will be productive of a higher standard of sanitation. It is with pleasure I have to record that the policy of the Council during the past year has been one of progress in all matters relating to public health, although certain of the schemes embarked upon in the previous year for the improvement of the health of the District are as yet only in a transitional stage. While the coming year will no doubt see the consummation of some of them, in matters of Housing this work will necessarily be carried out in instalments according to the requirements of the district, and will possibly be spread over the next five years. Progress in this direction is set out in detail in the portion of the report dealing with Housing matters. Publication of the Medical and Sanitary Reports giving details of Public Health conditions and activity in a District is becoming yearly more important and necessary, for the following reasons:—Firstly, they are required by an Order of Local Government Board which has the effect of a statutory enactment. They enable the Board to gauge the general health conditions of the country, and so bring defaulting authorities who are a menace to surrounding Districts into line, and to co-ordinate the work. Secondly, they have an educational value to the public, while the exchange of reports between officers in similar districts enables experiences to be compared ; and thirdly, the officers' duties being prescribed by the Local Government Board, it follows that many of them are performed upon the officers' own initiative and not at the instigation of the Council, and lying as they do with the individual rather than with the Council, it is imposible and in some cases undesirable to report in detail upon many subjects at the time, as this would entail undeserved hardship in certain cases, therefore, a great deal of discretion must perforce be left in the hands of the Public Health officials. This being the case, the annual report preserves a record of the year's achievements, and brings to the knowledge of the Council in a more intimate manner than is otherwise possible, the wide range 32 and quality of the officer's work. It likewise serves to enlist the sympathies of many outside the ranks of the Council, who are concerned in the amelioration of social conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1875. INSPECTION OF DISTRICT AND REMOVAL OF NUISANCES. The general inspection of the District continues to be carried out periodically, and all complaints investigated, such nuisances as are discovered being dealt with under the provisions of the Health Acts and Bye-laws in force relating to them. The course of serving a preliminary notice upon the person in default, specifying the works necessary to abate the nuisance, has been followed. Should such person, however, fail to comply with this preliminary notice, the matter is brought before the Council and the usual statutory notice is served, which is followed up if necessary by legal proceedings. The policy of serving an intimation notice is a good one, inasmuch as an owner will often readily fall into line and comply with it with a better grace than if the subject matter of the notice were brought before the Council in the first instance, and realising that the Inspector wishes the abatement of the nuisance with as little friction as possible, he will often listen to and carry out suggestions for improvements such as cannot be legally enforced. There is always a tendency to resent compulsion, and therefore, any method which will secure the maximum standard of work with a minimum of friction, is obviously the proper one to pursue. When nuisances are caused by tenants and are not of a structural character, very often verbal intimation is all that is necessary to be given for their abatement. In only one instance has it been necessary to advise the Council to institute Police Court proceedings to secure compliance with a notice to abate a nuisance. The following table shows the number and nature of the nuisances dealt with during the year:— 33 nature of nuisance. no. Choked condition of drains 8 Defective drains 5 Dilapidated paving of yards 5 Absence of paving to yards 12 Accumulations of manure and other refuse 17 Fowls improperly kept 4 Offensive and defective gullies 2 Defective and obsolete water-closet cisterns 18 Insufficient water closet accommodation 5 Insufficient gully accommodation 3 Defective roofs of houses 4 Defective eaves and down-spouting 29 Defective and unventilated soil pipes 2 Nuisances caused by defective urinals 1 Overcrowded houses 4 Defective walls, ceilings, and floors 21 Insufficient ventilation of rooms 1 Nuisances caused by damp walls 1 Defective and obsolete water-closet basins 17 Defective sinks and sink waste pipes 1 Dilapidated outbuildings 14 Dirty houses 2 Absence of water supply to water-closet cisterns 10 Cesspools abolished 1 Total 187 CARAVANS USED AS DWELLINGS. The caravans which entered the district to attend Barnet Fair were inspected as in previous years, in order to detect any nuisances which might exist, and also with a view to discovering any infectious disease. One caravan was found to be in a dirty condition. Verbal intimation was given to the occupier to have the van cleansed, which was done. With this exception, the whole of the vans were found to be in a cleanly state. Temporary sanitary accommodation was enforced as in the previous year, a number of earth closets being erected for the use of the van dwellers. This accommodation was supplemented by temporary public conveniences at High Barnet Station and at the foot of the hill in the East Barnet Valley area. The fish-stall holders were a source of nuisance, and repeated cautions had to be given against the filthy practice 34 of throwing fish-shells on the ground, both at the Fair and in the High Street, as it was productive of very noxious smells owing to the hot weather. The excessive heat and absence of rain for a long period previous to the Fair had the effect of producing very unfavourable conditions, and the dust raised was a grave nuisance. Indeed, it is surprising so little illness resulted. Beyond a few cases of diarrhoea, which received medical attention, no illness of an infectious type was found to exist in the vans. COMMON LODGING-HOUSES. The number of Common Lodging-Houses upon the Register remains the same, namely, two. One house has increased its accommodation during the year by an additional room for married couples, after having been altered to comply with the Bye-laws. This room was registered to accommodate 4 persons. The accommodation available in these Houses is for 54 lodgers, as compared with 50 last year. . During Barnet Fair three midnight inspections were made. The prosecution of the keeper of one of these Houses for overcrowding, and infringing against the Bye-laws during the previous Fair, has evidently had a good effect, for during the whole of the Fair both Houses were conducted upon proper lines, and their condition generally has been satisfactory throughout the year. DISEASED AND UNSOUND FOOD. The premises wherein food is stored and prepared for sale have received numerous visits with a view to securing that it is prepared under proper conditions, and that no unsound food is exposed for sale. A case of suspected Swine Fever having occurred in one of the Slaughter-houses, the Police communicated with the authorities under the Contagious Diseases Animals Act, who gave instructions for the burial of the carcase, which was carried out at the Farm. I thereupon ordered the remaining pigs, three in number, to be slaughtered, and made a careful examination of the carcases and offal. They were found to be perfectly healthy and I accordingly passed them as being fit for food. 35 A quantity of Biscuits and Cakes was seized at Barnet Fair. These were quite unfit for food owing to the filthy condition they were allowed to get into by exposure due to the clouds of dust raised, and were calculated to produce diarrhoea if eaten. A quantity of these biscuits were destroyed upon receipt of Magistrates' order, and the remainder by the stall holders on their condition being pointed out to them. The following is a list of the unsound food which has been destroyed during the year:— 1 Carcase of Pig and Offal—Suspected Swine Fever. 22 Pairs of Kippers. 31 lbs. of Biscuits and Cakes. A Carcase of Beef, dressed and cut into four quarters, was found in Totteridge Lane. It was apparently that of a Cow in a very emaciated condition, and the method in which it was dressed indicated that it had originally been intended for food. Enquiries were made to ascertain where it came from, but without result. The Carcase was conveyed to the Farm and buried. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS, AND MILKSHOPS ORDER, 1885. There are 19 Dairymen, Cowkeepers and Purveyors of Milk upon the Register. Two applications for registration have been made during the year. (Article 6.) Another year has passed and there appears little likelihood of the long-promised Milk and Dairies Bill for improving our milk supplies being re-introduced for some considerable time. Careful attention continues to be given to the inspection of these premises, and every attempt made to secure the supply of a pure uncontaminated article. One cowshed was practically destroyed by fire. The owner had this shed repaired, but as many of the wooden uprights were very much charred, and the materials used in the repairs totally unsuitable, he was restrained from using it for dairy purposes, and informed that if so used he would be liable to prosecution. He has now decided to construct a brick-built cowshed, and I hope this will be provided before long. 36 The chief source of complaint arises not so much from the cowsheds as from their surroundings, which in some instances are far from desirable. The elementary principles of hygiene seem to be altogether ignored, and frequently attention has had to be drawn to the filthy state of the approach to the dairy and shed, and to the close proximity of the manure heap to the dairy, which in a summer like the past becomes a grave danger through the medium of the fly. INFECTIOUS DISEASES PREVENTION ACT, 1890. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. During the year the Zymotic Diseases enumerated below have been investigated and reported upon to your Medical Officer of Health, as compared with 1910 and 1909. Nature of Disease. Year 1911.

Totals 54 15 31 9 59 11 Although during the latter part of the year a slight epidemic of Scarlet Fever occurred, the total number of cases for the year compares favourably with the previous two years, and is 50 % less than in 1908, when 107 cases occurred. A pleasing feature is the continued low number of cases of Diphtheria notified, as this condition is more closely associated with insanitary conditions than Scarlet Fever, which is spread to a great extent by personal infection. In combating infectious diseases, a factor is becoming yearly increasingly more important, namely, the 37 munication of an ever-growing proportion of the population of Barnet with that of the Metropolis. A few years ago this proportion was small, and consequently the risk of importation of infection slight. The tendency of late years amongst the workers of London to migrate into the suburbs has been responsible for the introduction of fresh inroads of infection, which require to be carefully watched. During the past year a number of cases were traced to direct importation, enquiries having elicited the fact that the patient had been in contact with a person whom it was known had contracted infection. Highly infectious diseases such as Scarlet Fever are readily transmitted from one district to another, and the experience of Barnet of a slight epidemic during the past few months has been co-incident with that of London generally, and it is therefore quite feasible that owing to this intercommunication of populations an outbreak in a particular district or districts may have had its origin the other side of London. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. The above Acts are enforced by the County Authority in this district. The subjoined information regarding the number of samples taken in the Urban District of Barnet during the past year has been supplied to me by the County Inspector. Article. Number of Sampl's taken.

Totals 33 33 ... ... ... 38 PRIVATE SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. There are 5 Slaughter-houses in the district. As stated in my previous report, 4 of these claimed to be registered, but having no proof to this effect I made investigations and required the occupiers to produce evidence of registration, the Council having no record of these premises. The Meat Trades' Association took the matter up on behalf of the butchers, and after a good deal of negotiation it was proved that the occupier of one of the Slaughter-houses could not substantiate his claim. He was therefore requested to make application to be licensed. The application was made, and a license was granted for one year. There are now 2 Slaughter-houses which are licensed yearly, and 3 claiming to be registered. One butcher was detected slaughtering on unlicensed premises at the rear of his shop. I reported the matter to the Council, who instructed the Clerk to write and caution him. The Slaughter-houses are frequently visited to ensure a wholesome meat supply and to secure the frequent removal of garbage. Particulars of Meat Inspection are given under the heading of Unsound Food. OFFENSIVE TRADES. The steps taken last year under the provisions of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907, sec. 51, amending sec. 112 of the Public Health Act, 1875, to include by Declaratory Order the trades of Leather Dresser, Fish Fryer, Rag, Bone and Skin Dealer, and Fat Renderer or Melter as Offensive Trades, have been successful, and the Local Government Board have issued an Order to this effect. The Order declaring the above trades to be offensive has been advertised through the usual channels, and Bye-laws are now being carefully drawn up, regulating the carrying-on of each trade. Broadly speaking, they will provide that the trades specified above can only be established within the district with the consent of the Council, and if allowed to be 39 established must conform with the provisions prescribing the nature of the building and the particular apparatus necessary to prevent any nuisance arising from the offensive materials used in the various processes. The Bye-laws when drafted will be submitted to the Council and Local Government Board for approval. DISINFECTION. Forty-nine houses wherein 54 cases of infectious disease occurred have been disinfected under my direction and supervision, after the patient has been removed to Hospital, or, when the patient is kept at home, after convalescence. The system of disinfection has been more perfect than hitherto, owing to the steam disinfector being now in use for the disinfection of infected bedding and articles of clothing. This is followed by spraying the walls, floors, and ceilings with formaldehyde, and the scrubbing of the floors, skirtings, and woodwork generally. The bedding is also washed after being returned from the disinfector. Disinfectant soap has been supplied during the year in preference to the supply of powder, and is undoubtedly an improvement, for the reason that my experience has been that a great deal of ignorance is displayed as to the uses to which powders and fluids should be put. It is a common experience to see the liquid and powder placed in saucers about the sick room or sprinkled under the bed. It is therefore not surprising that owing to this false sense of security little attention is given to the very essential procedure of cleansing with soap and water. To be effective a disinfectant should be capable of miscibility, and be applied to the article to be disinfected. Unless these conditions are complied with it may be productive of more harm than good. The supply of soap in the case of the poorer houses tends to promote a greater degree of cleanliness, which after all is the best possible preventative against the spread of infection. Another important point is the supply of plenty of fresh air, for the object of disinfection is not to purify the vitiated atmosphere of a room, what is necessary is to obtain a fresh supply. 40 Again, in regard to the use of powders and fluids in connection with the drainage of a house. A number of articles are upon the market, which, although called disinfectants, are in reality only deodorants, or at most antiseptics, and they are used more often than not in a manner which merely hides an objectionable effluvium, probably due to an accumulation of decomposing fats. It is a pity that attention is not given to the proper cleansing and flushing of gullies and drains. They require to be kept clean just the same as the cleansing of a house is necessary, but in a large number of cases my experience is that they are rarely if ever touched, and sooner or later the emanations become extremely unpleasant. A great deal depends upon attention to details in the home. Just as a filthy cistern may contaminate the water supply, whereby the microbe is responsible for disease and death, so may the absence of attention to details of cleanliness be responsible for a general lowering of vitality, and so render the person susceptible to attacks of disease. These acknowledged conditions should be a strong plea for a better understanding of the laws of hygiene, and I believe these can be most fittingly learnt by including them in the school curriculum. The steam disinfector will be requisitioned in the future for the disinfection of articles of clothing and bedding belonging to patients suffering from tuberculosis, and every facility given to owners as regards the disinfection of houses vacated by tubercular persons, before such houses are again let. In 4 instances schools were disinfected after the closure of the school owing to the prevalence of infectious disease amongst the scholars. During the school holidays the whole of the schools in the district were thoroughly disinfected as a precautionary measure against the spread of infection. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTS (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1907. PAVING OF YARDS AND PASSAGES. Twenty-seven notices have been served under section 25 of the above Act, to properly pave or flag the surfaces of yards 41 with some hard impervious material, the absence of which was found to be productive of damp walls or dirty surroundings. Twenty-four notices have been complied with, and 3 notices were outstanding at the end of the year. The 9 notices outstanding at the end of the previous year have been complied with. This paving work may be regarded as being very beneficial, tending as it does to the prevention of dampness to the walls of the house by allowing the surface-water to drain away properly, and being a boon to the tenants in promoting cleanliness in the house and surroundings. PROVISION OF SINKS TO DWELLING HOUSES. In 16 cases, notices have been served to provide sinks to houses, and in 12 cases the notices have been complied with. Every house should have this necessary provision, and I am pleased to say that the steps taken in this direction during the past 3 years have resulted in nearly the whole of the houses in the district being now provided with sinks, and water being laid on. Very few places now exist where a tap and gully common to some half-dozen houses provided the only means of water supply and disposal of waste water. TABLE OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. Proceedings were taken in respect of the following cases, viz.:— (1) Application for an order upon the occupier and owner of No. 123, Wood Street, requiring such occupier to vacate the cottage condemned under the provisions of the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, as unfit for human habitation. The order was granted to take effect in one month. (2) Application under the Small Tenements Recovery Act, 1847, for order to eject occupier of No. 123, Wood Street. Order refused upon a technical objection. 42 (3) Renewed application under same conditions as previous application. Order granted. I have also been authorised to take proceedings against the owner of a ditch which is a source of recurring nuisance and requires piping in. These proceedings have not yet taken place. BYE-LAWS. Bye-laws are in force within the district dealing with the following sanitary matters which come under my jurisdiction, viz.:—Nuisances, Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops, Common Lodging Houses, Removal of House Refuse. In every case in which any infringement of these byelaws was found, notices were served upon the person in default. With respect to the model bye-laws of the Local Government Board, dealing with the drainage of existing buildings, as stated in my last Report, these were altered so as to suit the requirements of a residential district like Barnet. They were returned by the Board considerably altered, who stated that the reason for the alterations was that a much higher standard of work was required under these bye-laws than under those relating to new buildings. As I am getting a higher class of work executed than would be possible under the bye-laws as amended, I deemed it advisable to request the Council not to adopt them, which course they have taken. I would, however, urge the desirability of adopting fresh bye-laws dealing with new buildings. When these are sanctioned, I have no doubt the Board will approve of the drainage bye-laws as originally submitted, and produce a uniformity of work both in new and existing buildings. DRAINAGE WORK. This important work still continues to receive careful attention. Two houses have been reported upon as being without drains sufficient for the effectual drainage thereof. Resolution was passed in each instance authorising me to serve 43 notices under Section 23 of the Public Health Act, 1875, to provide sufficient drainage and connect with the main sewer. In 11 instances, drains were reported upon and examined under Section 41 of the Public Health Act, 1875, while the remaining drains were smoke tested. The total number of drains to houses and other premises reconstructed during the year is 36. In connection with this drainage work I have reported the following sewers as being defective, viz.:—the sewer at rear Nos. 21, 23, and 25, New Road ; sewer at rear Nos. 27, 29, and 31, New Road; and sewer at rear Nos. 24, 26, and 28, New Road. It was resolved to re-lay them, and this was done. In connection with the re-draining of Nos. 1 to 12, Underhill Cottages, it was found desirable to lay a new length of sewer in front of these houses, this work being carried out by your Surveyor. Nine houses were found to be without sufficient water closet accommodation. In each instance this accommodation was provided. The reconstruction work has been carefully supervised and frequent visits have been made to the premises while such work was in progress. This re-drainage has involved the laying of about 860 yards of glazed earthenware pipes, 48 gullies, 32 intercepting traps, 20 pedestal, etc., water closets, 4 soil pipes ; 11 ventilation shafts were fixed, and 32 manholes built; the number of tests applied in connection with the work being 142 water tests and 23 smoke tests. The following is a list of the premises, the drains of which have been re-laid under my supervision:— 44 Situation of Premises. Materials Used n Construction, &c. Remarks. No of Houses.

I reported to the Council upon the advisability of having the drainage and sanitary fittings of the whole of the Public Schools within the district examined and tested yearly. The Council accordingly passed a resolution requesting me to make application to the School Managers for facilities to carry out this work. Permission was readily granted in each instance, and the examinations were carried out during the summer holidays. The necessity for a yearly inspection of the drainage of school premises is evidenced by the defects discovered, as shewn below. School. Result of Examination. Remedial Works. Arkley Infants' School A portion of the drain between the inspection chamber and the ventilating shaft was found defective. The drain was properly repaired. Hadley Infants' School Cap to raking arm of intercepting trap missing. Drain therefore not properly trapped and allowing sewer gas to pass from sewer into the drain. Fresh air inlet defective. Eavesgutters and spouting defective. Drain and fittings properly repaired Christ Church Girls' School Pipe in main portion of drain cracked and defective. Inspection chamber to w.c's. not efficiently sealed, allowing effluvia to escape. Eavesgutters missing. Drain repaired and new eaves - gutters fixed. 46 Christ Church Boys' and Infants' School Drains silted up with gravel throughout entire lengh, and sewage matter lying in the pipes. Drain found to have reverse fall in places. Very defective. Urinal floor defective. Entirely new system of drainage laid. Floorof urinal concreted. National Boys' and Infants' Schools Ventilation shaft (3in. ordinary rain water stack pipe diminishing to 2in.) found to be choked. Cap to disconnecting trap missing, allowing sewer gas to gain admittance to drain. Eavesgutters dilapidated. Heavy cast iron 4in.ventilating shaft fixed. Drain properly trapped. Moxon Street Infants' School Ventilation shaft broken. Connection to w.c's. defective. Branch drain choked. Connections to w.c's. repaired. Branch drain unstopped and heavy cast iron ventilation shaft fixed. Byng Road C.C. School Drains and sanitary fitting sound and in good condition. It would be in the interests of the health of the district if all Private Schools were tested in a like manner to the Public Schools. ABOLITION OF CESSPOOLS, EARTH AND PAIL CLOSETS. The following cesspools, earth and pail closets have been abolished in connection with work carried out. 47 Underhill cottages, six trough closets of insanitary type abolished and twelve water closets erected in lieu thereof. Arkley Copse, Arkley, cesspool abolished and drainage connected to sewer. 123, Wood Street, privy abolished through closure of house. Very few cesspools, earth, privy or pail closets now exist in the district, and those few remaining will be abolished as opportunity presents itself. There are however a few cottages at Arkley where it will not be possible to install the water carriage system until a sewer is laid which will enable them to be drained into it. In the meantime the Council undertake the cleansing of the earth closets. ICE CREAM, FRIED FISH, AND POTATO SHOPS. The trade of Fish Frier having been declared offensive by sanction of the Local Government Board, steps will be taken as soon as Byelaws are in force dealing with it, to regulate the conditions under which this commodity can be prepared, and incidentally that of Potato frying, where both are carried on together, although this latter does not constitute an offensive trade of itself. The power of dealing with such premises hitherto has been very limited. FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901. WORKSHOPS. Three notices of occupation of new workshops have been received from the Home Office. This makes a total of 57 Workshops upon the register as compared with 54 last year, excluding Bakehouses. Four Workshops were found to be without the factory abstract affixed, as prescribed by section 128 of the Act. In accordance with section 133 H.M. Inspector was notified in each instance. Where any infringement was found, the occupier was at once notified to remedy the act, neglect, or default. 48 The number of cubic feet of air space required for each person being prescribed by the Act, cards are being affixed stating the number of persons that can be worked in each room during ordinary working hours, and also when overtime is being worked. No complaint has been received from the Home Office with respect to any Workshop. BAKEHOUSES. The occupier of one Bakehouse has given up during the year, but as the premises were registered in the name of another person, the number on the register remains the same, namely, nine. This number includes an underground bakehouse not at present in use. Careful attention has been given to these premises, and five notices have been served to secure the carrying out of the special sanitary requirements. All Bakehouses are required to be thoroughly cleansed and limewashed at least twice a year, and special attention is given to the drainage and paving of surroundings. OUTWORKERS. Ten lists of outworkers have been received in compliance with sec. 107 of the Act as follows:— Seven lists from firms within the district, all employing Outworkers who are living in the district. Three lists of outworkers employed by firms within the district, but who are living outside the district. The addresses of outworkers living outside the district have been sent to the respective Councils. Five addresses of outworkers living in the district, employed by firms outside the district, addresses of which have been received from other Councils. Those outworkers living within the district have been visited, but in no case has any infectious disease occurred in their homes during the past year, and the conditions under which they were working were found to be favourable. 49 FACTORIES. FIRE ESCAPES AND SANITARY CONVENIENCES. The fire escapes provided in connection with factories in the District have been maintained in good condition and free from obstruction. The sanitary conveniences in these factories have also been inspected, and were all found to be in a cleanly condition, and quite sufficient for present needs. Details of the Factory and Workshop inspection are given in the tables on pages 25 to 27. MOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890. HOUSING AND TOWN PLANNING ACT, 1909, INSANITARY PROPERTY. Twenty-four houses have been condemned during the past year as unfit for human habitation, which, together with 28 in 1910, and 53 in 1909, makes a total of 105 condemned since my appointment. Particulars of the action taken with regard to insanitary property are appended. Sixteen of the houses reported upon in the previous year had not received attention up to the end of the year. These have been dealt with as follows :— Nos. 1 and 2, Bennett's Cottages, Wellhouse Lane. Closing orders were served upon the owner, who intimated his intention of closing the property rather than comply with my requirements for placing them into a habitable condition. This was accordingly done. The cottages having remained closed for the requisite time, notice was served upon the owner to attend a meeting of the Council and show cause why the property should not be demolished. The owner attended the meeting, and after consideration the Council decided to grant an extension of two months, the reconsideration of the question being left over until the new year. No. 123, Wood Street. The tenant refusing to comply with the notice which was served upon him to vacate the house, it became necessary to apply to the Court for an order requiring him to quit. Application was made and the order granted to take effect in one month. At the end of this period, the tenant still refusing to quit, further steps had to be taken to enforce the order. It was found that the Housing and 50 Town Planning Act was defective in so far as it did not provide for the enforcing of the ejectment order, and this gave rise to some difficulty. Ultimately it was decided to obtain possession under the Recovery of Small Tenements Act, 1847, and application was made to the Court for an order under this Act. This was not granted, some objection being taken to the serving of the notices upon the tenant. The Council, being of opinion that the Act had been complied with in every particular, renewed their application, and the necessary order was thereupon granted. At the expiration of the necessary period, the tenant still remaining obstinate, it was my unpleasant duty with the aid of the police to eject him. After much difficulty the furniture was removed by the Council's staff into the street, where, as it was not removed by the owner and was causing an obstruction in the highway, it was removed to the Council's Depot until claimed. The total disregard by the tenant of the notices served upon him resulted in these unpleasant steps having to be taken, but as to their need the subcommittee who visited the property later were in entire agreement. The house having remained empty the necessary period, the owner has been notified of the time and place when the question of demolition will be considered. Nos. 1 to 12, Underhill Cottages (12 houses). Plans were submitted to the Council for practically reconstructing this property. Additions were made to four houses by providing an extra bedroom and scullery, and attics were made to three others. The work also included new roofs, windows, frames, doors, and staircases. Floors and joists were also renewed where necessary. The rear walls of the houses were rough-casted. New drainage was provided to each house, and twelve water closets were erected in lieu of existing trough closets. These cottages have been thoroughly repaired, and are now quite fit for human habitation. No. 121, Wood Street. Attempts have been made to get the owner of this house to either put the property into a habitable condition, or to erect another cottage upon the site, but without success. Steps will therefore have to be taken to secure its closure and demolition as soon as a favourable opportunity arises. This is at present difficult owing to an inmate of the house being bedridden. 51 Nos. 3 to 13, Bath Place (11 houses). This property being closed in the previous year, steps were taken to secure its demolition. Notices were served for this purpose, and the owners thereupon demolished the property. Bath Place has now ceased to exist. With regard to the property dealt with during the year— a total of 24 houses—the following action has been taken:— Nos. 1 to 15, Gladstone Place (15 houses). This property is in a very dilapidated and insanitary condition. Closing orders were served upon the owners under the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909. Plans of proposed drainage and a specification of works to be executed were submitted to the Council and approved. Owing to the trustees being in different parts of the world, negotiations with regard to the property have been protracted, but the necessary powers to proceed with the work of placing it into a habitable condition having now been obtained, I anticipate the work will be put in hand at an early date. Nos. 1 to 4, Black Horse Yard (4 houses). Closing orders were served upon the owners of this property, who decided to close it. The cottages now remain empty. Steps will be taken later to secure their demolition. Oak Cottage, Bells Hill. Closing order was served upon the owner who had the cottage closed. Nos. 1 to 4, Trent View Cottages (4 houses). These cottages, although of modern construction, had been erected contrary to the Bye-laws, which require a 24ft. roadway to every new street. No such road exists, the entrance to the property being by means of a narrow passage-way, and consequently plans should never have been passed for them. They became insanitary, due to the fact that they were frequently flooded with sewage owing to the position in which they were built. The property changed hands, and the new owners readily complied with the wishes of the Council and gave the tenants notice to quit. The cottages now remain closed. Closing orders were not served in this case, as it was 52 felt they could be readily turned into good warehouses. Had closing orders, been served this would not be possible as the Local Government Board hold that it is necessary to follow up such orders by demolition. The Potteries, Arkley. Notices were served upon the owner to carry out certain works to this property. It was decided not to carry out the work, and the tenant, who was put in as caretaker, removed. The property shortly after changed hands and was demolished to make room for a new building. HOUSING SCHEME. The Council, in pursuance of their policy of securing the proper housing of the working classes within their district, have, as a first instalment, erected 30 cottages upon the estate purchased for this purpose. The chief qualifications for the cottages are that the applicants shall be of the working class not earning more than 40s. weekly, and must have had twelve months previous residence in the district. This condition of previous residence precludes the possibility of the cottages being acquired by persons other than those resident in Barnet, the Council merely wishing to provide for the needs of the District by relieving the undoubted overcrowding which exists as a result of the dearth of accommodation, and for those residents whose existing housing conditions are insanitary. The applications were carefully considered by the Council, and the wages of the selected tenants range from 18s. to 37s. per week, the majority of them earning less than 30s. per week. It is generally accepted that a person should not pay more than one-fifth of his wages in rent, and indeed it is difficult to see how he could afford to. This being the case, it cannot truly be urged that the Council have not selected the right class of tenant. The question of providing for the person who can only afford to pay 4s. to 5s. per week has yet to be dealt with, and the Council have pledged themselves to meet the needs of this class in the near future. 53 The present cottages, which let at a rental of 6s. 6d. per week, are six-roomed, containing a kitchen, 17ft. 3in. by 10ft. 6in. and 8ft. high ; a parlour, 9ft. 9in. by 9ft. 9in.; and a scullery, 7ft. 1in. by 6ft. 9in., with copper, sink, and bath, on the ground floor. There are three bedrooms of the following dimensions:—13ft. 3in. by 10ft. 3in.; 10ft. 3in. by 7ft.; and 9ft. 1Oin. by 6ft. 8in. Each cottage stands upon a plot 90ft. by 21ft. 6in., and has a front garden 10ft. in depth, and a kitchen garden 61ft. in length. A Local Government Board Inquiry into the application to borrow a further sum of £4,700 for the erection of an additional 22 cottages has been held, and the application has been granted, on condition that a number of smaller cottages be proceeded with directly these are completed. A portion of the estate not needed for immediate development is let off for grazing and allotments. The cost value of the estate with the present buildings is £8,310, viz.: Land £2,500, and cottages £5,810. The total charge against the estate amounts approximately to £538, and the estimated income is £522. Taking the land only upon which the existing cottages stand, a clear profit accrues of £46. Therefore, as the estate is built upon, the small deficit shown above will be wiped out and the scheme will become a profitable undertaking. As the cottages have not been occupied more than six months, it is impossible to give accurate details upon the working of the scheme, but in future reports I shall be enabled to do so. TOWN PLANNING. The Council have taken into consideration the question of Town Planning a portion of their District of about 100 acres, situate between Mays Lane and the boundary of the district at Pricklers Hill, and have requested the Surveyor and myself to report upon the subject. Barnet is delightfully situated, and is destined to become a much-sought-after residential area. If this growth has to take place, then it behoves us under these circumstances to plan out the District upon lines which will not destroy the amenities which we now possess, and thus it will remain a District desirable to live in. 54 This does not mean the immediate cutting-up of the area in question and making roads, but the planning of the area in such a manner that when owners of contiguous land desire to develop, they shall do so as part of one harmonious whole, and not in the haphazard way which at present exists to the detriment of each other and the District as a whole. Experience has taught us that it is not a costly thing to plan, but exceedingly costly to rectify those mistakes brought about by the absence of any planning in the past. The cost to the country of pulling down buildings of more or less modern construction to widen thoroughfares has been enormous, and in Barnet we have examples of errors in this direction, portions of the roads having been scheduled by the Road Board for widening in the future. Again, there are obvious advantages to be obtained from the Town Planning Act. Under present conditions, when a portion of the district is developed, in order to sewer it the Council have to pay for easements over different properties. This sewer is laid without regard to the question of whether it can be used for any future development, and, the Council having no idea how owners intend to develop, damage is often done to an estate. If the sewer were laid along the line of future roads, not only would no damage be done, but the estate would be in a ripe state for development, and it is conceivable that betterment charges might be made in certain cases for these advantages. The power, without having to pay compensation, of limiting the number of houses to the acre, is of immense value in a district like Barnet. The question of Town Planning is exercising the minds of over 100 Authorities at the present time, and numerous plans are in various stages of preparation. Failure to plan a district will result in the future in it becoming a dumping ground for undesirable buildings and development. As a member of the Advisory Committee of the National Housing and Town Planning Council, I have been enabled to follow the schemes put forward by various Authorities, and have gathered much valuable information upon the subject, which I trust will be of use to your Council. 55 SANITARY LEGISLATION, 1911. The following sanitary measures have been passed by Parliament during the past year. THE RAG FLOCK ACT, 1911. The object of this Act is to render it illegal (l) to sell or have in possession for sale flock manufactured from rags, or (2) to use for the purpose of making any article of upholstery, cushions, or bedding, flock manufactured from rags, or (3) to have in possession flock manufactured from rags intended to be used for any such purpose, unless the flock conforms to such standard of cleanliness as may be prescribed by regulations to be made by the Board. Penalties up to fifty pounds follow upon conviction for any of the above offences. It is made the duty of the Council, as the Sanitary Authority for their district, to appoint an officer and give him power to carry out any proceedings which the Council are authorised to institute and carry on under the Act, and to enter at all reasonable times any premises in which he has reason to believe an offence under the Act is being committed, and to examine and take samples for the purpose of analysis of any flock found on the premises, the sample to be divided into two parts to be marked and sealed, one part to be left with such occupier. Obstruction of the officer is punishable under the Act, and the expenses of the Council are to be defrayed as part of the general expenses incurred in execution of the Public Health Acts. This Act comes into force on July 1st, 1912. PUBLIC HEALTH (TUBERCULOSIS) IN HOSPITALS) REGULATIONS, 1911. These Regulations were issued by the Local Government Board in March, and extended the system of partial notification of Poor Law cases of pulmonary tuberculosis to cases occurring amongst the in-patients or out-patients at Hospitals or certain other similar Institutions for the treatment of the sick. The Regulations require that every case of pulmonary tuberculosis should be visited, and inspection made of the 56 premises; also that advice should be given for the prevention of the spread of the disease. Records have to be kept of all cases, and the action taken noted. Patients leaving a Hospital and going to another district must be notified to such district, who must take steps to see that the case is being followed up. PUBLIC HEALTH (TUBERCULOSIS) PECULATIONS, The above Regulations were issued in November, and extended the partial notification of cases of tuberculosis in Poor Law Institutions and Hospitals to the complete notification of all cases of pulmonary tuberculosis. Medical Practitioners are therefore required, under penalty, to notify all cases, and similar steps have to be taken with regard to these cases as are taken with those previously made notifiable. These regulations came into force on the 1st of January, 1912. SHOP HOURS ACT, 1911. This Act, is a considerable modification of the Bill as originally submitted, the greater portion of which, including the sanitary provisions, had to be abandoned in order to secure the non-contentious principles becoming law. The chief provision is that of a compulsory half-holiday for all shop assistants. An amending and consolidating Act will be necessary before this matter can be said to be finally dealt with. In conclusion, I again desire to express my appreciation of the support which has been extended to me by every member of the Council in my efforts to carry out the ofttimes difficult duties imposed by the numerous Health Acts. My thanks are also due to the Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Hardie, for his valuable help. I am, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Yours obediently, CHARLES W. HILL, M.S.I.A., Sanitary and Housing Inspector. 57 Summary of Sanitary Work performed in connection with Inspection of District. Report in pursuance of requirements of County Council. Inspections.
