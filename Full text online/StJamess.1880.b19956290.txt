FROHLICH, JUN., JOSEPH STANDISH, GEORGE BROOKS. Auditor Genral Report Of Words EXECUTED BY THE VESTRY OF ST. JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER, IN THE YEAR 1880-81. 17 To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of St. James's, Westminster. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, June, 1881. Reverend Sir, Mr. Chairman, and Gentlemen, In presenting an abbreviated summary of the more salient works that have been executed by the Vestry, that is to say, works connected with Paving or Sewerage, between March, 1880, and March, 1881, it will be as well to state that the numerous questions that have to be submitted to the Vestry, or their Committees, are not detailed, as such detail would form a most uninteresting and almost useless list of subjects well known to all the Members, and of importance in themselves, the whole of which being entered upon the minutes of their proceedings can at any future time become subjects of reference. The lists accompanying this report relate not so much to matters of routine whose name is legion, but to those special works that show the yearly progress of one particular Parish or District, and as such, become a record of great interest when compared with each other, B 18 year by year, and are really instructive; supposing the Five and Twenty Reports already published were taken seriatim, the works as stated in the present list would then, that is in 1856, have been considered chimerical and any proposer of such, might have had his sanity considered rather doubtful. The progress thus reported really amounts to a gradual development of wants long recognized, and by degrees become to be tangible facts, capable of actual accomplishment; it is needless to remind the Vestry of the amount of detail involved in bringing about any actual novelty; when such is really done there is not much surprise further than a feeling of wonder that it was never thought of, or rather done, before. Prominent among such matters is the application of Wood for Paving in the place of stone; however much there is yet hidden, and there is much to be learned, it is quite clear that the fact is demonstrated that for some localities, at any rate, Wood possesses combined advantages not known to any other material. The drawbacks that we know of can be guarded against, and the only reason for alluding to the subject is the radical change involved as to the material—as to the various methods of applying the material no allusion is necessary, as time and experience will solve those; as one opinion the fewer substances mixed with the wood the better the work will prove to be. Friction, or as we call it, "traffic," will have its results, be the material what it may, that is required to meet it, although that is not the only requisite in a 19 really good road, as, according to the peculiar circumstances, many other important items occur of equal, if not more consequence, than the question of durability. The Parish of St. James's has now the opportunity of profiting by the gradual experience of their own work; how far they will be justified in continuing the use of wood as a material, such as they have in Pall Mall and Regent Street, which work having been honestly and well done, cannot fail to be a useful guide for the future. All details as to various methods being public property from the crowds who from curiosity, or real interest, watch the progress of such works, render description superfluous. As Wood for these purposes has to be brought to England from other countries, the effect of change of climate is not the least important, and change of climate is practically a serious view of the question as those who have been compelled to investigate such questions well know. Although there is a difficulty in giving the preference to either Paving or Drainage, both are equally important. There is not any great difficulty in either, the judgment required cannot be proved theoretically; experience is the teacher. The general condition of the Sewers in St. James's Parish are perhaps as perfect as can be expected, that is to say, that constant supervision renders the conveyance away of all that once gets into them a matter of detail; but smells from those substances will arise, and the problem of what, is called "ventilation" of sewers is still unsolved, 20 It must be borne in mind that districts cannot be isolated, that one sewer has to help another, perhaps miles away, so that beyond taking care that each individual sewer is equal to its work, there can be very little control as to what work has to be done. This care becomes divided, as each district has not only to look after itself, but also that which is transferred from somewhere else. This is again complicated in St. James's from the number of old drains, wells, and abandoned cesspools, the existence of which is rarely revealed, unless by accident—the utter want of system upon which these things were formerly done, baffling all speculation. Whether any actual scheme of practically ventilating the Metropolitan Sewers can be carried out is, in my opinion, doubtful. So far as we have gone, if it is not an improper expression, we try to bottle it up, so that there shall be no escape. But this attempt, as common sense will show, must defeat itself, as the thousands of miles of sewers will only transfer the evil from one locality to another. If the question were asked, Is there no remedy? however distant that remedy may be, it appears to me that there is. Not by removing effluvia from sewers, but by hindering its being there at all to be removed. By an improved system of gullies we can check this from surface impurities. Then as to House Drainage. This is a question of great delicacy. The solution will be found, sooner or 21 later, in the construction of public water closets, for both sexes, so that the necessary substances may be at once disinfected, and rendered useful instead of becoming a source of danger or annoyance, to put it in its mildest form. It has seemed to me after years of reflection upon not the most agreeable subject, that this is the starting point so to speak. It is clear to me that the difficulties in the way would be numerous, but not so much in fact, as in imagination. Privacy is dear to all Englishmen, and that could be much more effectually secured by public conveniences, than in most private houses; emergencies would have to be provided against—age, illness, etc. I wish some more able hand would take this view of the question. The fact of its being a delicate subject does not put it beyond the pale of consideration. The simple summing up of the question is as far as possible to keep accumulations out of sewers, instead of having to remove them afterwards, The idea is not altogether so Utopian as it may appear. We have only to visit a railway station, as a practical example of the way in which the question is actually understood there, and not misunderstood by any. However unpleasant the question may be, as London and large towns increase, it must, sooner or later, be honestly looked in the face. In concluding this part of the subject, it is clear that 22 the Vestry of St. James's cannot at present take the initiative, the district, from circumstances, has to relieve, accept, and dispose of the result from other districts, and as the more distant contributors to sewer "gases," or whatever name may be bestowed upon what are generally called "smells," do not themselves feel any immediate result, makes it difficult to impress upon them that others do. In wider suburban roads with gardens in front of the houses, the result is not so palpable as when a great amount of such unpleasantness is concentrated in such a locality as Berwick Street or Silver Street. The unsolved question of Ventilation of Sewers must remain unsolved till such time as they will not require any ventilation at all, or at any rate very little. The definition of Ventilation of Sewers means really getting rid of the smell. The Metropolitan Board of Works have done much towards this, more than is generally understood, but the point to be really aimed at, is to have as little to get rid of as possible. This subject leads naturally to the next, viz., Public Conveniences. The Vestry and the Works Committee know so well how they have been, and are, hedged round with difficulties on this most important subject that any observations are quite superfluous. One small affair in King's Arms Yard, Glasshouse Street, has certainly been accomplished. The continuance of this is even now partly on sufferance. It is not the 28 fault of this Vestry that no more has been done. The Vestry having for the last twenty-five years been most active in all ways to promote the public requirements in this respect, it would be superfluous to refer to what has occurred during the last few years in connection with this duty that they have so energetically tried to fulfil. Having before referred to the wanton and foolish damage, to give it no other name, that is persistently inflicted on these structures, and which still continues, there is but little to report further than that all possible care is taken to preserve those that do exist, and make the best of a most unthankful necessity. Another important matter has been most carefully considered, the Public Lighting of Streets, and this requires and has received full consideration, both parsimony and extravagance being excluded from the question. That improvements in this direction have been made involving ample consideration, cannot be denied. These actual improvements will literally serve as beacons or guides for the future. The new lamps recently erected, somehow receive damages that cannot be exactly the result of accident; the ingenious contrivers only think of honest "wear and tear," and if they did think of wilful injury, it could not be guarded against, without rendering the very object of their invention, if not useless, of very much less use than they expect it to be. 24 The general routine work of the Vestry has been carefully carried out, and the numberless minor matters, that are referred to here, have been carefully seen to, without accidents from any cause. I have the honour to be, Reverend Sir, Mr. Chairman, and Gentleman, Your most obedient, humble Servant, A. P. HOWELL, Surveyor. 25 GENERAL WORKS, &c., EXECUTED BY The Vestry of St. James's, Westminster, from 25th March, 1880, to 25th March, 1881. Situation. Description of Work.

Table of Articles Analysed 60 33 TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS or The Vestry of St, James's, Westminster, Reverend Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the following Report upon the Public Health of the Parish of St. James's, "Westminster, for the year 1880. It will be remembered that the District of St. James's Parish covers an area of 164 statute acres, and that the mean density of the population, taking as a basis the enumeration of 1871, is 205 persons per acre. For the year 1880 the net mortality of the Parish has been 589, amounting to a death rate of 17.6 per 1000—the population being taken at 33,500. The mortality from zymotics in the year 1880 has been 93, and there have been in addition 10 other deaths among zymotic cases removed from the Parish to extraParochial Hospitals. Of Fever, Small Pox, and Diphtheria, 84 cases came c 34 under notice during the year; many cases not being known in consequence of there being no law requiring notice of such cases to be given to the Sanitary authority. Of these 84 cases 3 were of Small Pox, 78 of Fever, and 3 of Diphtheria. 43 cases—40 of Fever and 3 of Small Pox—were removed to extra-Parochial Hospitals. During the year 1880 fifty-seven bodies were removed into the Mortuary. Of these bodies five were cases of infectious disease in which disinfection was required, and where the removal of the corpse was probably the means of preventing the spread of infectious disease. In fortythree cases bodies were removed from the presence of families mostly living in a single room, and where, but for the public Mortuary, the living would have lived and slept in presence of a decomposing corpse, and, possibly, a post-mortem examination would have been made before the interment could take place. In six cases the bodies have been those of casual strangers—homeless, or occurring in Hotels or Lodging-houses. Upon bodies lying in the mortuary, twenty-two Inquests have been held and twenty post-mortem examinations have been made for judicial purposes. Three bodies were those of persons who had died in the workhouse of the Westminster Union. 35 The following number of Deaths were registered as having occurred in St. James's during the year 1880:— First Quarter 179 Second Quarter 158 Third Quarter 145 Fourth Quarter 141 Gross mortality for year 1880 623 Deduct Deaths of Non-Parishioners — Dying in the Workhouse 34 Dying in the Throat Hospital 9 — 44 579 Add Deaths among Zymotic cases removed to extra-Parochial Hospitals 10 Net mortality for the year 1880 589 589 deaths in a population of 33,500 is a death rate of 17.6 per 1000.

Lond., F.R.M.S., F.C.S-, Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst for St. James's, Westminster. Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, During the year 1880, under the provisions of the "Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875," 221 samples were examined, of which 220 were procured for examination, and one was submitted by a parishioner—a sample of cream which was found to be perfectly genuine. Among the 220 samples procured for examination there were 12 of milk, 42 of tea, 42 of coffee, 59 of sugar, 89 of cocoa, and various specimens of potted meats, tinned fruits, etc. In none of the specimens was any injurious adulterant, or any poisonous colouring matter detected. No money or other consideration, except the stipend paid by the Yestry, has been received by me in connection with these analyses. I have the honour to remain, Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, JAMES EDMUNDS. 8, Grafton Street, Piccadilly. 60 ST. JAMESS, WESTMINSTER.
