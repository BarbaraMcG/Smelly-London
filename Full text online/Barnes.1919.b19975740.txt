To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Barnes. Gentlemen, The year 1919 has been uneventful as regards Infectious Diseases. A few cases of Influenza, the remains of the 1918 epidemic, occurred, some of which being complicated by pneumonia, were treated at the Isolation Hospital. Scarlet Fever was rather more than twice as prevalent as it was in the previous two years; was part of a Metropolitan epidemic; was mild and caused no deaths. Diphtheria has not manifested itself to any extent in the District except for outbreaks in private schools, one at the end of 1918 and the other in 1919. Measles has not been severe during the year, but I have advised the Public Health Committee to keep the notification of the disease in force in the District, as it has proved a helpful measure in the past. Unfamiliar diseases have arisen as a result of soldiers returning from abroad, such as Malaria, Dysentery, Trench Fever. These are dealt with according to the instructions sent us from the Ministry of Health. Clinics for the treatment of Venereal Diseases are available at Hammersmith and Richmond for residents in the District. A powerful propaganda film ("The End of the Road") has been shown to selected audiences, and should, I think, with certain reservations, be shown to the public. There has been no Enteric Fever in the District beyond two imported cases ; and one case of para-typhoid fever. 6 General. Cases of mal-nutrition among School Children noticeable during the War are improving, though there is still a lack of nourishing fats, sugar and milk, which must have an adverse influence on the quickly growing child. Cancer—There were 39 deaths from this disease, including 15 males, and 24 females, giving a mortality rate of 1.09 per 1,000, compared with 1.07 in 1918. Consumption—44 cases were notified in 1919, against 58 in 1918, and 54 in 1917. Infantile Mortality—Ante-natal causes accounted for 22 deaths out of a total of 46 infants under 1 year of age, The Population was estimated by the R.G. as 37,193 for calculating Birth Rate, and 35,704 for Death Rate figures, compared with 36,223 and 32,495, in 1917 and 1918. The Birth Rate for 1919 is 13.7, and is steadily increasing, compared with 12 in 1918, and 13.2 in 1917. The Death Hate.—'The residential death is 8.4, but the nett deaths belonging to the District give a rate of 9.5, compared with 12.4 in 1918, and 10.9 in 1917. The Natural Increase (births minus deaths) is 162, compared with 34 in 1918 and 125 in 1917. The Infantile Mortality Rate works out at 89.6 for every 1,000 births, compared with 91 in 1918. See Table III. at end of this Report, where it will be noticed that 23 of the deaths were due to Ante-natal conditions and largely non-preventable; one was due to suffocation, and under "other causes" are included those found drowned or dead, without any trace of identity. This subject has been dealt with more fully later on (see page 8). With regard to Cancer, the mortality rate has risen slightly. Deaths among males include 3 over 40 years, 3 over 50 years, 5 over 60 years, and 4 over 70 years. Among females, 3 were over 30 years, 4 over 40 years, 2 over 50 years, 8 over 60 years, and 7 over 70 years. 7 General. PHYSICAL FEATURES AND GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE DISTRICT. The Urban District of Barnes extends from Hammersmith Bridge to the Richmond Boundary at Manor Grove, and Upper Richmond Road, East Sheen. It covers 1,583 acres, and is 3i miles long by 1J miles broad. The Urban District includes the Ranelagh Club, reservoirs of the Metropolitan Water Board at Barnes Elms and Lonsdale Road, 600 acres of Richmond Park, 126 acres of Barnes Common, 52 acres of East Sheen Common, and 15 acres of Palewell Common. There are some 50 acres in use as Allotments, including 6 acres of Barnes Common. The District is situated in the N.W. corner of Surrey, and is within the Metropolitan Police and the London Postal area. Contiguous to the District are parts of Putney, Roehampton, Richmond, and the River Thames. The District lies on gravel over London clay, and rises gradually towards the Park to 64 feet above sea level. The Atmosphere is humid, especially along the river valley and in the more wooded parts of the District, severe cold is seldom experienced, the effects of heavy rains quickly disappear except in the waterlogged area drained (sic) by the Beverley Brook. The Industries of the District are (a) Brewing; (b) Driving, Conducting and Repairing Omnibuses (London General); (c) Motor Engineering; (d) Chocolate Manufacturing; (e) Market Gardening; (f) Building. The Census population of 1901 was 17,900, that of 1911 was 30,377 The pre-war population was 34,745, and the estimated present population 37,193; the number of dwelling-houses is 7737, but the separate tenements are computed to be 8,000. Table I. at the end of the Report, sets out the estimated population over the past five years. 8 Vital Statistics. STATISTICS FOR 1919.

Infants dying in Institutions number 9, including 4 illegitimate. While the mortality of legitmate infants is 89.6 for every 1,000 births, that for illegitmate infants reaches the appalling rate of 461 per 1,000 births. Nothing can show more plainly the fate of the "not wanted" child. 5 deaths were due to Accident or Violence. Congenital Malformations account for 5 deaths. Syphilis and Tuberculosis account for 3 deaths. 17 deaths were accounted for by Ante-natal conditions on the part of the mother. Two of the deaths, viz., Convulsions and Syncope, are so illdefined as to be impossible to classify. So that only 14 deaths can be really classed as preventable, and coming within the scope of the work of the Health Visitors. 1 have gone into this infantile mortality in detail, because I am disappointed at the high rate of mortality. However, we cannot control deaths in Institutions, nor deaths from violence, nor those arising from malformations. What we must aim at is by advice to the expectant mother to do our best towards keeping her in good health, and helping her to go to her full term of pregnancy. Many infant deaths are the result of prevailing social conditions, such as worry, overcrowding, too short intervals between pregnancies, women working in an advanced state of pregnancy, and recreation taken without due regard to health and exercise. We have tried to secure the co operation of the Midwives in the District in regard to Ante-natal work, but have failed. The reason is not difficult to find. The Midwife's first business is her income and the size of her clientele, which she has no desire to lose, nor to share her responsibilities for such with another body. If the Midwives' income was made secure by the Local Authority, and a certain number of beds set aside in the District for her cases by the Local Authority, then she would probably join the Ante-natal Campaign. I am convinced that the only way to do Ante-natal 10 Sanitary Circumstances of the District. work thoroughly is by professional co operation rather than by voluntary help. POOR LAW RELIEF DURING 1919. 147 orders were issued for Medical Attendance. 78 orders were issued for admission to Workhouse and Infirmary. 26 deaths occurred among Barnes and Mortlake cases in the Workhouse Infirmary. Hospitals serving this District include:— The Royal Hospital, Richmond. The Putney Hospital, Putney Common. The West London Hospital, Hammersmith. The Isleworth Infirmary (through the Richmond Board of Guardians). The Richmond Infirmary, used by the War Office at present, will eventually revert to its original purpose, and release the Brentford Guardians of their responsibilities so far as Richmond and this District are concerned. The Isolation Hospital in Mortlake provides for the Isolation of Infectious Diseases for the Urban District, and contains 50 Beds for Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, and Tuberculosis, the County making use of some of the beds for the latter disease. WATER. The Water Supply is that of the Metropolitan Water Board. It is constant, sufficient, and of good quality. Its plumbo-solvent action is negligible. The raw Thames water is stored to allow of sedimentation, and then filtered. It is quite likely that Chlorine will plav an important part in the purification of future water supplies. The system of storing drinking water in cisterns in houses is not to be encouraged, and wherever possible we get Taps off the rising Main supplied to houses. SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE. The Water-carriage System prevails throughout the District with separate channels for storm water. The Sewage is treated at 11 Sanitary Cirbumstances or the District. the Richmond and Barnes Joint Sewage Works—the effluent discharged into the Thames and the sludge barged away. The Pumping Machinery at the Works can deal with 50 million gallons of water daily; a good deal of the rain water goes direct to the river by a special system of drains, but most of the roof water enters the sewers. The sewage is treated with chemicals, sedimented, filtered and then discharged after aeration, three to four million gallons being thus treated in the 24 hours. The residue or sludge is filtered under pressure and pressed into slabs 2£in. thick, and amounting to 7,000 tons of pressed cake annually, which is barged away and sold for agricultural purposes. I only know of three cesspools and one pail closet in the District, and these are only allowed because of the difference in level between drains and sewers. SCAVENGING. For collection of House Refuse the prevailing system is one of movable sanitary bins, which are emptied once weekly, and the contents cremated in the Council's Destructor. The resulting clinker is used for making pavement slabs in normal times. There are several fixed receptacles for refuse still in use, which tend to become untidy and leaky unless properly rendered inside and out with cement. These fixed receptacles are being gradually replaced by movable ones as opportunities arise. SCHOOLS. The Public Elementary Schools, with the exception of Mortlake Council Schools, East Sheen Council Schools, Lonsdale Road Council Schools, and Westfield's Boys' School, are old buildings, and do not conform architecturally to modern ideas. The sanitary arrangements are satisfactory. The Caretakers would have more control Of the dust, if Dust Allayers were used on the floors and Vacuum Cleaners run over the walls, cupboards, and hangings. There is an urgent need for a good Secondary School in this District. No Schools were closed for infectious disease during the year. 12 Sanitary Circumstances of the District. Contagious skin diseases have been prevalent. The Private Schools in the District have been systematically visited and various sanitary defects remedied. Medical inspection of the children should, in my opinion, be undertaken with regard to these private school children, on the same lines as that obtaining in the Public Elementary Schools; and powers granted in that direction would, I think, be of great benefit to the welfare of the children, whether day scholars or boarders. VERMINOUS AND OTHER CONTAGIOUS AFFECTIONS. It is generally agreed that during the War, home life has been altered and children neglected as far as cleanliness is concerned The mothers are often out all day, and the children get out of hand in more ways than one. The bulk of the subjects of these dirty conditions, including itch, scab and ringworm, are children of school age, and are treated by the School Authorities; it is also to some extent a Public Health question in view of recent research work. I do not see for the moment how more can be done in this District. The School nurses follow out the routine laid down by the Surrey Education Committee, but cannot be expected to do the actual cleansing where the mother fails. Itch, scab, and ringworm, are largely treated at the School Clinic. Itch is treated specially (when the cases will go) at the Council's Disinfecting Station with good results. The Surrey Education Committee have not recognised the necessity for a Cleansing Station for verminous children, so that *Section 122 of the Children's Act is not applicable in this respect. If the station were more used, dirty heads and bodies could be cleansed there after a trial had been given* at the child's home by his parents. Overcrowding, infected bedding, dirty hair brushes, etc., are the chief causes of failure at home. In this connection it is of interest to note that the earliest recorded occurrence in Britain of the bug is an account of its appearance in 1583 amongst some ladies of noble birth at Mortlake (see "Public Health Journal," January, 1920). * Plans are maturing between the C.C., and the U.D.C., for the cleans ing of children at the Council's Station in Mortlake. 13 Sanitary Circumstances of the District. SCHOOL NOTES. Children Inspected during 1919:— Infants. Boys 137 Girls 138 Eight Years Old. Boys 176 Girls 168 Twelve Years Old. Boys 152 Girls 142 Leavers. Boys 19 Girls 30 Specials. Boys 12 Girls 14 Re-examinations. Boys 172 Girls 181 Total Inspections, 1321. Recommended for Treatment, 346. Cases Treated at School Clinic, 130; including 74 new cases during the year. Attendances made at Attendance Clinic, 833. School population, 3580. Three mentally defective and two physically defective children were examined and recommended for special institutions or schools. ISOLATION HOSPITAL. There were carried over from 1918 eight cases of Diphtheria, three cases of Scarlet Fever, one case of Pneumonia, and 15 cases of Tuberculosis, 14 Infectious Diseases. The admissions were:— Diphtheria, 33. Laryngitis, 1; Septic Tonsillitis, 2; Follicular Tonsillitis, 1; Septicaemia, 1; sent in as Diphtheria. Pertussis, 3. Febricula, 2; 1 sent in as Scarlet Fever and 1 as Influenza. Scarlet Fever 62. Enteric Fever, 1. Erysipelas, 1. Post-Influenzal Pneumonia, 9. Post-lnfluenzal Bronchitis, 1; Post-Influenzal Pleurisy, 1; sent in as Pneumonia. Tuberculosis of the Lungs, 76. Total Admissions, 194. Deaths, 24 of Tuberculosis—resident, 6, non-resident, 18; 1 of Diphtheria; 3 of Pneumonia. The high mortality from Tuberculosis is solely due to the advanced stage of the disease on admission. The Nursing and Domestic arrangements and duties have been satisfactorily carried out under the direction of the Matron (Miss Pearson). Those responsible for the Garden, Laundry, Disinfector, Ambulance, Mortuary, and Coroner's Court have carried out their duties satisfactorily. The Ward Blocks and other Buildings have been repaired and painted inside and out. A New Boiler has been re-instated in the Laundry. A Covered Way has been built on the north side of the Tuberculosis Block to afford extra protection from the weather to the patients. For Statistics, see Table 4 at the end of this Report. The Coroner's Court and Public Mortuary are situated in the grounds of the Isolation Hospital, and are the property of the District Council. The Hospital Porter acts as Mortuary Attendant. 15 Infectious Diseases. The number of Inquests held during 1919, was 33, including 17 residents, 12 non-residents, and 4 unknown. The verdicts returned were:— Natural causes 11 Accidental 7 Suicide 5 Found drowned 5 Murder 1 Unascertainable 4 33 TUBERCULOSIS DISPENSARY (Opened in 1911). Two Sessions of two hours each weekly are held. Total cases examined since 1911= 1,060; new cases examined in 1919 numbered 112. A monthly return is made to the County of old and new cases, whether insured, non-insured, or dependants, and whether recommended for Hospital, Sanatorium, or other treatment. Tuberculin is given to certain cases, and palliative medicaments, malt and oil, etc., to those requiring them. Cases referred by the Ministry of Pensions are also seen at the Dispensary, also delicate School Children referred by School Medical Officer. After going over eight years' records of children of school-age treated at the Tuberculosis Dispensary, I have come to the conclusion that out of every 1,000 School Children, six may be stated to show definite signs of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Fuller details of this Special Report I hope to publish at an early date. Tuberculosis (pulmonary):— Year. Notifications. Deaths.

Influenza.—67 cases of post-influenzal pneumonia were notified, with 24 deaths. In 1918, there were 88 deaths from influenza, including 54 of post-influenzal pneumonia. Measles and Rubella.—There was no epidemic in 1919, 84 cases only of measles, and 75 cases of rubella, were notified. I have recommended the Council to keep these diseases notifiable in this District.* Scarlet Fever.—88 notifications were received with no deaths resulting, compared with 32 cases in 1918 with no deaths, and 37 in 1917 with no deaths. Diphtheria.—42 cases were notified as such with 4 deaths, including one only in Hospital. Whooping Cough accounted for two deaths, both in children under 1 year. This disease was not prevalent to any extent. Infantile Diarrhœa.—There were 5 deaths only from infantile diarrhoea, and the disease was not prevalent during last summer.f Enteric Fever.—Three cases were notified with one death (at home), an imported case. Typhus.—Nil. Small Pox.—Nil. Polio-myelitis. — None. Cerebro-spinal Fever.—Two cases were notified as such, and both died at home. The disease was not confirmed bacteriologically, "contacts" showed negative results. Malaria.—18 cases were notified, all amongst returned soldiers. There were no deaths. Malarial Sites have been pointed out to the Council, and treatment of the same advised. Trench Fever.—Three cases have been notified, but no lice found on or about the patients. Dysentery.—One case has been notified in a returned soldier. Encephalitis Lethargica.—Two cases have been notified with one death (at home). This disease has often been called " sleeping sickness" in the press, but is quite different from that disease. * Since approved by Ministry of Health. † Children up to 2 years of age in this case. 18 Housing. Puerperal Fever.—Two cases were notified with 1 death. Ophthalmia Neonatorum.—Three cases were notified and treated until well, with no resulting damage to the eyes. For deaths from all causes, see Table 3 at end of this Report. Also see Table 2 for the list of Infectious Diseases notified during the year. HOUSING. The pre-war population of the District was 34,745, and the present population is estimated at 37,193, and no new houses have been built, hence there is overcrowding and sub-letting. The number of dwelling-houses in the District is 7,737, of which 1,599 are of the working class type. There are 448 houses, intended for one family only, which are now occupied (without having been specially adapted) by two or more families. 300 new houses are required to meet the demand. 22 are required to replace those structurally unfit. 62 are required to replace those becoming unfit. Only two Closing Orders have been made for obvious reasons. It is intended to erect 42 houses during 1920, 100 more by 1922, 100 more by 1923, and 58 more by 1924. The Housing Committee are making use of the new powers conferred by the 1919 Housing Act, and a large amount of repairing work is in hand. Bye-Laws are in course of preparation to assist the Council in the proper conversion of houses, originally intended for one family, into flats for two or more families. There are no Common Lodging-houses in the District, but some of the houses in Stanton Road are such in fact, if not in name, and will have to be dealt with under the new Bye-Laws. Special Reports have been made by your Medical Officer on certain old property in the Mortlake High Street and in parts of Sheen Lane, with a view to scheduling the same for consideration in the near future. Hampton Square has been reported upon owing to the prevalence of Tuberculosis therein, and the congestion of the 19 Housing. houses. A plan was submitted showing that by the demolition of six houses much more air space could be obtained. West Road was dealt with more on account of general untidiness, due to litter and want of proper ash bins. Stanton Road and Beechcroft Road were reported upon as examples of houses turned into flats without proper sanitary equipment, such as a self-contained flat should contain. It must be borne in mind that unless the regeneration of slum areas goes hand in hand with Town Planning and new Building Schemes, there is no hope whatever of getting a result even approximately approaching Garden City Schemes. Many of the Council's Schemes are maturing, or about to mature, and it is hoped that the gross cases of overcrowding occasionally coming to our notice will soon cease to exist. It is very remarkable that Infectious Diseases have not been more prevalent than they are, since the two great factors, overcrowding and lowered resistance, have been and are still with us. It is, however, more than probable that the evil results have manifested themselves in a more subtle way in the shape of premature births, marasmus, bronchitis, and pneumonia. In my opinion, the rules laid down for cubic space in living and sleeping apartments and schools are antiquated, and hold that a growing child requires as much fresh air as an adult, and that every one should breathe 3,000 cubic feet of pure air per hour, or 1,000 cubic feet thoroughly changed three times in the hour. Accessory Means of Ventilation (simple and inexpensive) should obtain in every habitation by day and night. Special Housing Work in 1919 comprises the following:— HOUSING ACT, 1909. Complaints were received from householders re structural defects in seven cases. Under Section 17 of the same Act, 80 dwelling-houses were inspected, 28 of these were considered unfit for human habitation. None of these were rendered fit, but are awaiting Closing Orders when more houses are available. 20 Child Welfare. HOUSING ACT, 1919. SECTION 28. 34 Orders for repairs were issued. None of these were done by the Local Authority; no houses were voluntarily closed, and only one Closing Order was made. MOTHER AND CHILD WELFARE CENTRE. 21 Ante-natal Cases attended during the year, and made 49 subsequent attendances. 135 new Babies attended under one year of age, and made 1,546 subsequent attendances, while 42 new Children over one year of age attended, with 773 subsequent attendances. The Centre was opened on 98 occasions, and the average attendance at each Session was 25. There was no Baby Show in 1919, but a Garden Party was arranged for the mothers and children, followed by an al fresco concert. Twelve Certificates of Merit were awarded to mothers of the twelve best attended babies in the two Districts. In connection with Baby Week, a Lantern Lecture was given by the Medical Officer, and an address by Dr. Barbara Tchaykovsky. A great deal of Food (Infant) has been sold at the Centre, and, with the increasing numbers on the register, voluntary help has been accepted, so as to release the Health Visitors for their more professional work. The present accommodation can only be considered temporary, for in several ways it is unsatisfactory. Since the Milk (Mothers and Children) Orders of 1918 and 1919 have been in force, 103 families have been assisted in the purchase of cow's milk, where the case has, after enquiry, been found to be a necessitous one. INSTITUTIONAL ARANGEMENTS FOR MOTHERS AND CHILDREN. It is very desirable that a Maternity Home should be provided nearer home than in London, for the reception of women whose Child Welfare. 21 home circumstances are unfavourable to the confinement taking place there. A Hostel for Deserted or Unmarried Mothers with their babies has been opened at Epsom, and provides 10 beds for Surrey women. The Surrey C.C. have also made arrangements for the admission of mothers with children under five years into Convalescent Homes at Bexhill and St. Leonard's, upon the recommendation of Medical Officers of Child Welfare Centres. With regard to Dental Treatment for Expectant Mothers, 1 have drawn up a scheme after conference with the local dentists which might extend to the children of school age. The scheme, however, still awaits confirmation by the County.* Home Helps.—Advertisements were issued for women, for the work, but met with no response. The Barnes and Mortlake Day Nursery receives by the day the children of mothers who have to go out to work. HEALTH VISITORS. There are two Health Visitors, one for Barnes and one for Mortlake. An account of their work for the year is summarised below:— barnes. mortlake.

The Public Health Department has an Inspector of Nuisances and two qualified Assistant Sanitary Inspectors, while a Junior Clerk is about to be added. Food Sampling is done by the County Authorities. The Shops Act is administered by one Assistant Inspector, who reports on the Shops Act and the Public Markets to the Finance and General Purposes Committee. Work done under the Housing Act of 1919 is reported to the Housing Committee; the work under the other Housing Acts is reported to the Public Health Committee. The two Health Visitors, who are fully qualified nurses, work the Notification of Births Act, do Tuberculosis visitation, and work under the County as regards Maternity and Child Welfare work and School work. The Maternity and Child Welfare Centre was initiated by the Urban District Council in 1914, and taken over by the County in 1917. Tuberculosis Dispensary and Ward Treatment were also initiated by the U.D. Council, the first in 1911, and the second in 1913, and taken over by the County in 1914. The Midwives Act is administered by the County. The Hospital Staff consists of a matron, a sister, 7 nurses 7 domestics, and porter and portress, with gardener, boiler attendant, handy man and assistant gardener. Two of these men are partially disabled ; but the work could be done by three ablebodied men. Child Welfare. 23 SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. Barnes Urban District.—Samples Analysed, 1919. Aiticle.

REPORT OF INSPECTOR OF NUISANCES 130 Inspections have been made under the Housing Regulations, also 3,002 House to House Inspections, as compared with 1,614 in 1918, and 5,768 various other visits as compared with 4,018, 195 Preliminary Notices dealing with 441 Nuisances were served during the year 1919, and 34 Statutory Notices. The number of Factories in the District is 35 ; the number of Workshops, 90 > number of Bakehouses, 14 ; and Domestic Workshops, 37. The Dairies and Milkshops have received special attention, and on the whole are well kept. 24 Sanitary Administration. BUTCHERS, FISHMONGERS, COOKED MEAT AND PROVISION SHOPS. These premises are kept under constant supervision, the result being when any of these tradesmen receive a consignment of goods, and he has a doubt as to the same being fit for food, he invariably calls on the Inspector to decide. The following are results: Food surrendered and disposed of during 1919 as follows:—Beel, 131 stone; Heart, Liver, Spleen, &c., 59 lbs. ; Mutton, 4 stone ; Apples, 1A bushels; Rabbits, 2 dozen ; Eggs, 10 dozen ; Potatoes, 12 cwt.: Pork, 8 stone; and 2 boxes of Kippers. There is one licensed Slaughter House in the District, which is kept scrupulously clean. THE RATCATCHER Employed by the Council has accounted for 3,500 rats during the months of June to December. They appear to be prevalent all over the District. The banks of the river harbour a large quantity, and they have found foodstuffs in the various Allotments. The brown rat is the sp'ecies frequenting the District, and the fact of its harbouring fleas, which are the actual propagators of plague, makes it an actual danger. Continual complaints of a Smoke Nuisance from a Factory in St. Leonards Road were received during the past year. The chimney has now been heightened by 9 feet, and there has been no further complaint. Sanitary Administration. 2f Table Showing the General Work Done by the Public Health Department During 1919.

I trust that this Report has in a concise manner represented the work done by the Public Health Authority during the year; a year in many respects unique in that the State and the people are still suffering from the grievous wounds of a devastating War, as shown by the very unstable equilibrium of minds, morals and material evident everywhere. My Staffs in this Department and at the Hospital have done good work with the least possible friction, and I think are to be congratulated on their results. That work of the Department, which is controlled by the Surrey County Council, has proceeded amicably ; at the same time one would welcome the time when the Urban District of Barnes became the Local Education Authority. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, B. C. STEVENS. February 20th, 1920. P.S.—At the request of the Ministry of Health, the Council's Housing Scheme has been added to this Report in a detachable form for filing and reference by the Ministry. B.C.S. 28 TABLE I.
