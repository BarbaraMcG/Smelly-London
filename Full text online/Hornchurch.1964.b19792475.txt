Staffing. It is with much regret that the death has to be recorded during the year of Mr. R. E. Ingleby one of our Public Health Inspectors. Three Public Health Inspectors—Messrs. G. H. Smith, R. K. Raymond and W. R. M. Gray—resigned during the year and the four vacancies in the establishment were filled by the appointment of Messrs. R. G. Hull, E. W. Knowles, R. E. Richards and J. D. Miles. A new post was created during the year, namely that of Authorised Meat Inspector, and this was filled by the appointment of Mr. R. H. Slater. Miss W. A. Hepburn, Shorthand/Typist, retired on health grounds during the year following a prolonged illness and was succeeded by Mrs. S. Anderson. Mrs. M. Behn, Clerical Assistant, resigned and was replaced by Miss G. C. Taylor, who had previously been employed in a temporary capacity. Miss L. A. Patterson, Clerical Assistant, also resigned and at the end of the year this post was still vacant. Medical Examinations—Staff. During the year arrangements were made for the medical examination of 106 (206) employees or prospective employees—83 (102) permanent and 23 (104) temporary. The 1963 figures are given in brackets. Public Relations. Talks on subjects of Public Health importance were given to various local organisations in the area by members of my staff. Clean air in view of its progress in this district took pride of place as a subject for discussion with food hygiene a very close second. My thanks are once again due to Mr. Glyn Richards for his assistance in giving the fullest publicity to items of a public health nature. Laboratory Facilities. The arrangements remain the same as last year. Dr. E. Atkinson, Oldchurch Hospital, Romford, kindly deals with a variety of other bacteriological and occasionally pathological material, whilst the laboratories at both Rush Green and Harold Wood Hospitals respond willingly to any calls made upon them. Ambulance Service. The arrangements remain the same as last year, 11 Maternity and Child Welfare. The Essex County Council maintained clinics at the following centres throughout the year:— (i) Abbs Cross Lane, Hornchurch. (ii) Athelstan Road, Harold Wood. (iii) Avon Road, Upminster. (iv) Hornchurch Road, Hornchurch. (v) Nelmes Road, Hornchurch. (vi) St. Mary's Lane, Upminster. (vii) South End Road, South Hornchurch. (viii) Suttons Hostel, Suttons Lane, Hornchurch. (ix) Upminstar Road, Rainham. (x) Westland Avenue, Hornchurch. Nursing Homes. The two registered Nursing/Rest Homes in the district are supervised by the County Council. Midwives and Home Nurses. There are 19 (18 full-time, 1 part-time) midwives in the district who are appointed by the Essex County Council and are available to act in the capacity of midwife and of maternity nurse under the supervision of a registered medical practitioner. In addition to the midwives there are 10 home nurses (7 full-time, 3 part-time) working in the district. The midwifery staff attended 2,588 confinements during 1964 and the home nursing staff attended 1,151 individual patients. Day Nursery. A day nursery is established within the district at Diban Avenue Elm Park. It provides accommodation for 50 children up to five years of age. Domestic Help Service. A domestic help service is in operation and is administered for the Essex County Health Services by the Area Medical Officer, 34, Cresthill Avenue, Grays. Domestic help can be supplied for a period of two weeks in the case of a home confinement, but as there is a great demand for this service it is essential to apply as early as possible. Where there is illness approval may be given, upon receipt of a medical certificate, for a help to attend, 12 Domestic helps are paid by the County Council, but the person assisted is required to contribute towards the cost according to his, or her, means. An assessment form must, therefore, be completed if it is desired to claim reduction in the charge, otherwise the full standard charge, which is at present 4/- an hour, will be payable. Care of the Aged. No formal action was considered necessary during the year under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948. Meals on Wheels. I am indebted to Mr. L. F. de Warr, Chairman of the Old People's Welfare Association for the following information:— "Meals were supplied every day, except Sundays, during the year ended 31st December, 1964, the total of 8,715 meals being 1,500 more than in 1963. More than 100 persons reecived meals and the daily average was 28, each being served twice a week. The old person paid 1/per meal towards the cost of the service, the balance being met by the Hornchurch Council who provided the van. The drivers covered more than 7,000 miles in the year and the van gave satisfactory service. Mr. L. J. Taylor has continued to give his valuable services in organising the service, including the visit to each new applicant and acting as an emergency driver on frequent occasions. At the end of December there were 75 volunteer drivers/assistants on the rota. During the year we were unsuccessful in our efforts to increase the weekly supply of meals from two to three per person. Whilst the Hornchurch Council readily agreed to provide the additional money and the use of a second vehicle, we could not find a source for the extra meals required. The kitchen staff of St. George's Hospital, Hornchurch, has produced excellent meals but these are limited to thirty per day due to shortages of staff. I am pleased to report that we have now arranged to receive twenty meals per day for five days per week from the caterer supplying meals to Romford Council. This will enable us to give each old person three meals per week. The Hospital Management Committee has maintained the charge for each meal at 2/3d. until now but this increased to 2/6d. during February. The Romford meals will cost 2/11d. before delivery. Additional volunteers have come forward to help with the second vehicle and these make the total about 100. We share the opinion of Dr. Groarke that for those who need this service it should be available up to seven days a week, and we hope to be able to co-operate with the new Borough Council towards this ultimate objective. Our new centre in Inskip Drive will be opened later this month, and we expect to make full use of the kitchen in providing a 13 Luncheon Club and, possibly, some of the meals required by the mobile service. This is, however, subject to a full investigation of the matter now being made. To conclude, I must record the thanks of the Association for the manner in which the Hornchurch Council has supported us in the operating of this and various other services for the benefit of the elderly of the Urban District." Laundry Service for the Incontinent—Section 84, Public Health Act, 1936 Advantage is taken of the above Section legally to provide this type of service. Increasing use is made of it (a fuller note was made in my 1960 report) and it is invaluable to the relatively few but deserving families who benefit by its operation. Since the service was commenced the number of cases partaking was 91. The number of garments washed during the year was 9,381 as against 6,891 the previous year. County Welfare Services. Mr. Walter E. Boyce, County Welfare Officer, has kindly supplied the following statistical information in relation to the County Welfare Services in the Urban District during the year 1964:— (1) Residential Accommodation under Section 21 of the National Assistance Act, 1948. Number of Hornchurch residents in care on night of 31st December, 1964:— (a) In County Council homes 146 (b) In Out-County and Non-County establishments 22 During 1964, 148 applications received for Part III accommodation. resulting in 58 permanent and 19 short term holidays. (2) Accommodation for Homeless Families. There were 32 applications for temporary accommodation during 1964, resulting in 5 adults and 3 children being admitted. On 31st December, 1964, 6 women and 18 children remained in care. (3) Welfare Services for the Blind and Physically Handicapped. No. of persons registered at 31st December, 1964:— (a) Blind persons 169 (b) Partially sighted 47 (c) Defective sighted 25 Of these, 1 blind person participated in the Home Workers Scheme, and 11 blind and 6 partially sighted persons had been placed in employment. No. of physically handicapped persons on the register at 31st December, 1964 210 14 Home Safety. The last full year of the Home Safety Sub-Committee was an extremely active one, in fact it could be said that the Sub-Committee excelled itself and finished in a "blaze of glory." The usual float was entered in the Hornchurch Carnival and succeeded in gaining a prize. A most successful exhibit was again staged at the Carnival Fete and attracted well over a thousand visitors. A mobile home safety exhibition was staged consisting of three vehicles—one belonging to the North Thames Gas Board and one the Eastern Electricity Board displaying safe appliances. The third vehicle was a caravan hired by the Sub-Committee which explored the theme of 'Burns and Scalds.' Special features included a set of photographs showing the tragic results—especially to children—of severe burning or scalding accidents and a display of flameproof material both the fabric and made up garments. These three vehicles were sited on the Carnival Fete ground and then toured several secondary schools within the Urban District. This exhibition was well received and illustrated the value of having a "captured audience." Probably had these three vehicles been parked in isolation they would not have attracted a very large attendance, but, forming—as at the Carnival Fete—part of a general display and also being taken to the individual schools where the children were released a class at a time to view, a great number of people saw and studied the displays. The display of flameproof fabric was most apt as the Children's Nightdress Regulations, 1964, came into force on the 1st October, 1964. This legislation was unique in that it prohibited the sale of any child's nightdress in non-flammable fabric after this date irrespective of the date of manufacture. Legislation is not normally retrospective and to ensure compliance with this very necessary—and much sought after—law, every shop within the Urban District selling such garments was informed by letter of the salient points of the Regulations. In addition, inspections were carried out by the Department's Public Health Inspectors and in several instances garments were withdrawn from sale. Another innovation in 1964 was the extension of poster distribution. Apart from the normal display on official notice boards, special large posters were displayed on hoardings at the six railway stations within the district. A Home Safety handbook was also produced during the year under the expert guidance of Mr. Glyn Richards, Public Relations Officer. A similar handbook was produced during the first years of the original 15 Home Safety Committee and proved highly successful. It is only fitting, therefore, that a further publication of this type should be amongst the last endeavours of the Sub-Committee. The culminating effort in 1964 was the school poster competition. A reasonable number of entries was received, in fact had every school participated the judging would undoubtedly have taken many days. As it was each school that competed submitted a large number of entries. The competition was divided into three categories according to age and three prizes were awarded in each group. In addition, special prizes were awarded in respect of entries submitted from Corbets Tey School. The entries submitted not only included those that showed high artistic skill but also those that indicated the ingenuity and originality of the schoolchild. One of the prizewinning entries was selected for reproduction and was eventually printed and displayed on the railway stations as previously mentioned. In addition to the foregoing the normal routine campaigns were undertaken during the year, e.g. "Sight Protection," "Fireworks", "Water Safety" by the normal channels of leaflet and poster distribution at clinics and schools. None of these activities would have been possible without the full support and encouragement of the Members of the Sub-Committee and it is hoped that the formation of the new London Borough of Havering will strengthen the status of Home Safety—which would seem to be emerging at last from its 'Cinderella' role. The Royal Safety for the Prevention of Accidents has—whilst greatly increasing the rate of subscription—acknowledged the position of the new London Boroughs and has appointed a special organiser for the Greater London area. They have also promised that special increased facilities will be available to all Home Safety Committees within that area. It will be interesting to see if fact comes up to expectation. 16 SECTION C SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supplies. Main: 12 samples were taken by my Department during the year from the main supply. 5 were submitted for chemical and bacteriological examination and 7 for bacteriological examination only. In each case a satisfactory report was received. Well: Few now remain in the district. Mr. P. Gordon Spencer, General Manager and Chief Engineer, South Essex Waterworks Company, has kindly supplied the following particulars concerning the main supply for the district:— "The water supply of the whole of your area has been satisfactory in quality and quantity. Bacteriological and chemical examinations are made of the raw water, of the water in its various stages of treatment and of the water going into supply. A total of over 4,055 chemical, bacteriological and biological examinations have been made and all water going into supply was wholesome. In addition, samples were examined for radioactivity. Analyses have also been made of samples obtained from consumers' taps in various parts of the Company's district, including that of your Council, and all proved to be satisfactory. The water is not plumbo-solvent. No action has been necessary in respect of any form of contamination. The number of dwelling houses supplied as at the 31st December, 1964, was 42,600 and the population as at the 30th June, 1964, as obtained from the Registrar-General was 134,140. We are unable to state the number of houses supplied by standpipes, but the total is quite insignificant." Rainfall. The Engineer and Surveyor has kindly supplied me with the rainfall figures for the year which relate to "Langtons." The 1963 figures are given in parenthesis.

The Hall Farm refuse tip at North Ockendon caused a certain amount of anxiety during the year. This tip is operated by the East Ham, West Ham, Ilford and Walthamstow Joint Refuse Disposal Committee. Refuse Collection. The Engineer and Surveyor informs me that a further delivery of Pakamatic refuse collection vehicles was made during the year bringing the fleet of refuse collection vehicles to 9 Pakamatics, 2 fore and aft bulk loaders and 8 Chelsea type freighters. Clean Air. Our No. 6 Smoke Control Area was confirmed during the year and will become operative on 1st July, 1965. Full details of this area were given in last year's report. Specific complaints. Complaints of air pollution which were given special consideration by the Public Health Committee included fumes and smoke from Ford's foundry; sawdust from British Plimber; smoke and fumes from Harold Wood Hospital incinerator; smoke and fumes from the burning of waste oil at a Cranham garage and offensive smells from Bretons Farm Sewage Works. Special Processes. Liaison with the Alkali Inspector—Mr. H. Brigg, B.Sc., A.R.I.C., A.R.C.S.—is excellent and of course common problems do from time to time arise. Atmospheric Pollution Investigation. Our present programme comprises smoke filters at:— (1) Public Health Department, Billet Lane. (2) Elm Park Assembly Hall, Eyhurst Avenue. (3) Whybridge County Primary School, Blacksmiths Lane. (4) Bush Elms Secondary School, Hyland Way; and volumetric S02 apparatus at:— (1) Public Health Department. (2) Whybridge County Primary School.

A total of 57 have now been registered. Clean Air Act, 1956, Section 12. Some 15 notices in No. 5 Smoke Control Area were served during the year. General Information. Meetings of the National Society for Clean Air and its South East Division, the Standing Conference of Co-operating Bodies for the Investigation of Atmospheric Pollution; and the London and Home Counties Clean Air Advisory Council are attended as a routine. Sewerage and Sewage Disposal. I am indebted to the Engineer and Surveyor for the following information:— "The arrangements for sewage disposal from the areas at present draining to Bretons Farm Sewage Disposal Works are of course not ideal due to the inadequacy of the Works and various unsatisfactory features of the present sewerage system which will be overcome by the construction of the Riverside Sewage Disposal Works extensions and the trunk sewers. Nearly all the soil sewerage problems of the District are associated with the network of main sewers which will be beneficially affected by the trunk sewer scheme. The scheme will dispense with the need for sewage pumping stations at Harold Hill, at Hacton Farm and at Briscoe and Parsonage Roads, Rainham, which in turn will alleviate overloading of the Ravensbourne valley trunk sewer, the high level sewer near Suttons Lane, and main sewers at Rainham respectively. Associated with the main scheme, the projected Corbets Tey sewer will dispense with the present pumping station there and an improvement of the main sewer from Roneo Corner to Bretons Farm (of which a section was enlarged several years ago) will be needed. Elsewhere in the district, overloading of the soil sewers in the central area will be alleviated by the progressive stages of the concurrent improvement of the soil and surface sewers therein, and there will then remain only a very few other minor relief schemes to be implemented. Some parts of the sewerage system will, no doubt, need to be relayed in the future on account of their age and deteriorating condition, 19 Soil sewers. The following works have been completed:— The first stage of the Central Area 15in./18in. diameter improvement in conjunction with the approximately 670 surface water sewer improvement yards. Hacton Lane (new sewer near Little 9in. diameter Gaynes Lane) approx. 480 yards. Lake Avenue (extension of the sewer 9in. diameter to serve new development) approx. 55 yards. Queens Park Road relief soil sewer 12in. diameter is now in use. approx. 400 yards. Works will commence shortly on:— Central Area (stage II) in conjunction with surface water sewer improvement. Trial borings to investigate the route of the projected Corbets Tey sewer. Regional Sewerage Scheme. Work has commenced on the enlargement of the Riverside Sewage Disposal Works. A tender has been accepted for the construction of the two main trunk sewers—from Bretons Farm to the Riverside Works and in the Ingrebourne valley with connections to pick up existing sewers at the pumping stations at Harold Hill, Briscoe Road and Parsonage Road, and work will commence shortly. Surface Water Sewers. The following works have been completed:— Parkstone Avenue/Ernest Road 12in./18in./21in. dia. improvement approx. 570 yards. Central Area—first stage (and soil 36in/39in. diameter sewer) approx. 630 yards. Hornchurch Road relief (Roneo 18in./21in./30in./33in. Corner) stage I dia. approx. 950 yards. Manor Crescent—new outfall 12in. diameter approx. 200 yards. Park Drive/Cranston Park Avenue 9in./21in./24in. dia. relief approx. 330 yards. Nelmes Crescent/Sylvan Avenue relief 9in./15in./18in./21in. dia. approx. 370 yards. Improvement of Ravensbourne stream— approximately 420 first stage—concrete channel yards. Ditchworks at Strathmore Gardens/ approximately 650 Gordon Avenue yards. Ditchworks at Meadowside Road approx. 1300 yards. No. of physically handicapped person on the register at 31st 20 The following works are under construction:— Harold Wood (Queens Park Road) including soil sewer. Athelstan Road/Squirrels Heath Road relief. Claremont Gardens relief. Works will commence shortly on:— Central Area stage II (and soil sewer) (a) Sandown Avenue to Station Lane. (b) Billet Lane branch. Woodlands Avenue—enlarged culvert and new surface water sewer. Ash Lane—new sewer in lieu of ditch. Derby Avenue—new outfall (subject to satisfactory outcome of certain negotiations). Streets Made up and Taken Over.

No change in our arrangements has taken place during the year. Rodent Control. During the year the Rodent Operative paid some 401 visits to deal with infestations. 1,502 routine or revisits were also paid. The premises visited initially comprised 313 dwellings and 88 business premises or factories. Attendance at meetings of No. 3 Essex Workable Area Committee is normally made by the Chief Public Health Inspector so that a wider picture of County progress and procedure is available. Establishments for Massage or Special Treatment. The Essex County Council granted licences to 11 persons during the year authorising them to carry on establishments for massage or special treatment. 20 visits were made to the premises.

Carcases Inspected and Condemned. The following tabular statement regarding the post-mortem inspection of animals at the two slaughterhouses in the district is drawn up in accordance with the Appendix to Ministry of Health Circular 17/55 (last year's figures in brackets):— Cattle (excluding Cows) Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Goats Number killed 10,189 1,456 3,769 30,262 2,478 26 Number inspected 10,189 1,456 3,769 30,262 2,478 26 (2,333) (1,392) (1,264) (24,552) (12,358) (63) All diseases except Tuberculosis and Cysticercosis : Whole carcases condemned — 10 7 19 1 — Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 4,176 495 67 3,580 415 — Percentage of number affected 40.9 34.5 2.0 11.7 16.7 — Tuberculosis only: Whole carcases condemned — — — — — — Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 7 4 — — 38 — Percentage of number affected 0.06 0.3 — — 1.5 — Cysticercosis only: Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 43 3 — — — — Carcases submitted to treatment by refrigeration 6 1 — — — — Generalised and totally condemned — — — — — — 37 Food Hygiene. Food hygiene notices for permanent display were supplied to all cafes, public houses and factory canteens during the year. There was a much greater awareness by the public to the importance of food hygiene undoubtedly due to the publicity given to the Aberdeen typhoid outbreak which was found to be food borne. Slaughterhouses Act, 1958. 2 slaughterhouse licences were issued during the year. Meat Inspection Regualtions, 1963. There was no variation in the charges made by the Council in respect of meat inspection at the two slaughterhouses as noted in last year's report. Slaughter of Animals Act, 1958. 30 slaughtermen's licences were issued during the year (18 Jewish). Ice Cream. During the year 2 applications for registration as manufacturers (soft ice cream machines), 15 as vendors and 7 for registration of premises for the storage and sale of ice cream were granted. At the end of the year 5 persons and their premises were registered for manufacture and 317 for the storage and sale of ice cream. 110 samples were taken during the year for bacteriological examination 98 proved satisfactory. Appropriate follow up action was taken in the 12 instances where the samples were found to be not entirely satisfactory. In addition, 31 samples were taken under the Food and Drugs Act for examination by the Public Analysts. The quality of the ice cream sold locally remains in general of a highly satisfactory nature. 5 successful prosecutions were instituted during the year under review in connection with the sounding of chimes by drivers of ice cream vans on Sundays (Section 147, Hornchurch Urban District Council Act, 1936). Preserved Food Manufacturers. Section 90 of the Hornchurch Urban District Council Act, 1936, requires registration of preserved food manufacturers and premises. At the end of the year 70 persons and 85 premises were registered for the manufacture, preparation or storage of preserved meat. Regular supervision is maintained over them. 38 Essex County Council Act, 1952, Section 103. This section which deals with the registration of hawkers of food came into force on 1st April, 1953, and at the end of the year under review 88 persons and 18 premises had been registered. Milk Distributors. There are 8 milk distributors with 12 registered premises in the district. There are also 13 firms registered as milk distributors in Hornchurch whose premises are registered in other districts. In addition, 64 shopkeepers are registered for the sale of bottled milk only. Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960. The number of dealers' (pre-packed milk) licences in force at the end of the year was as follows:— Pasteurised 85 Sterilised 92 Tuberculin Tested/Untreated 71 Milk Sampling. The 68 samples of milk taken from dairies, shops and in the streets during the course of delivery to customers throughout the year were submitted to the laboratories for testing. In all cases satisfactory reports were received. 4 of these samples were also examined for the presence of antibiotics with negative results. In addition 24 samples were submitted to the Public Analysts for chemical analyses. No samples of raw milk were taken to ascertain the presence of Brucella Abortus. Liaison with other Authorities. Our excellent liaison with the London County Council in respect of the Hornchurch Children's Homes (St. Leonards) and the Brentwood Group Hospital Management Committee in respect of Harold Wood Hospital regarding the testing of their milk supplies continues. School Canteens. Our liaison with the Divisional Education Committee is now of a most satisfactory order and my thanks are due to the Divisional Education Officer, Mr. D. H. Wilcockson, B.A., M.Ed., for doing so much to achieve this. Shellfish. Samples of cockles, prawnes, scampi, shrimps and winkles were sent for examination during the year with satisfactory results. The Liquid Egg (Pasteurisation) Regulations, 1963. There are no egg pasteurisation plants in the district. 3 samples of liquid egg were taken from local bakeries during the year and were submitted to the Alpha-Amylase test with satisfactory results. Sausages. 2 samples of sausages from a local manufacturer and exporter were submitted to a local pathological laboratory for bacteriological examination, In each case a satisfactory report was reecived. 39 SECTION F PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER.

I am indebted to the Area Health Office for the following information concerning immunisation and vaccination statistics applicable to the Urban District for the year 1964:— Triple, Diphtheria/Whooping Cough/Tetanus Immunisation: Completed primary immunisations 2,105 Boost injections 1,157 Diphtheria/Tetanus Immunisations: Completed primary immunisations 167 Boost injections 415 Diphtheria Immunisation: Completed primary immunisations 24 Boost injections 1,165 Whooping Cough Immunisation: Completed primary immunisations 34 Boost injections 2 Tetanus Immunisation: Completed primary immunisations 1,514 Boost injections 655 40 Poliomyelitis Vaccination (Salk): Completed two primary injections 93 3rd boost injections 16 4th boost injections 28 Poliomyelitis Vaccination (Oral): Completed three doses 2,690 3rd boost dose 298 4th boost dose 1,789 Smallpox Vaccination: Primary vaccinations 1,580 Re-vaccinations 526 B.C.G. Vaccination (School Children of 13 years plus): Number vaccinated 847 Infective Hepatitis. 61 cases were notified as against 4 last year. The increase was mainly due to an outbreak at Suttons Hostel and this accounts for the high proportion of these cases which were hospitalised. Tuberculosis. Respiratory: The number of new notifications increased from 24 to 46. Non-respiratory: The notifications increased from 4 to 6. The site of infection and age of the non-respiratory cases were as under:— Epididymis Males 36 and 42. Ovary and fallopian tubes Female 41. Pelvis Female 21. Renal Males 26 and 36. Inward Transfers: These totalled 8 as against 21 last year. Deaths: There were 5 this year as against 7 last year. Cases on register: The number of cases of tuberculosis on the register at the end of the year was as follows:— Respiratory: Males 444 Females 352 Non-respiratory: Males 38 Females 27 Romford Chest Clinic. Noted below is some information from Dr. Stanley Steel, Consultant Physician, Romford Chest Clinic:— "During the year 1964 the Romford Chest Clinic has continued to serve the needs of the combined area of Romford Borough and Hornchurch Urban District. As forecast in the report on the services of the Romford Chest Clinic for 1963, there has been a steady decline in the 41 number of notified cases of tuberculosis on the Clinic register from approximately 1.500 to the present figure of approximately 1.000. This has been due to the fact that many patients have now reached the stage where they can be regarded as having recovered from their tuberculous disease. In consequence, there has also been a reduction in the number of contacts of cases of tuberculosis who have been followed up on the Clinic's miniature x-ray unit. In contrast there has been an increase in the number of patients referred to the Clinic by their general practitioners with non-tuberculous chest conditions, so that the work of the Clinic has, in fact, increased. This has also been added to by the number of patients referred by the mass radiography service which has been operating in the area. As a consequence, there has been a widening of the scope of the services of the Romford Chest Clinic to include the more general aspects of chest medicine and associated cardiac conditions, and an electrocardiograph and apparatus for resperatory function tests have been installed in the Clinic." Mass Radiography Unit The bi-yearly survey arranged by Dr. D. J. Lawless, O.B.E., the Medical Director of Mass Radiography Unit 6B, took place during the year. 7 factory visits, 3 schools, 2 old people's homes and 11 public sessions were carried out the number of attendances being as follows:— Numbers x-rayed Centre Males Females Total Lacrinoid Products 120 84 204 Deyongs, Southend Arterial Road ... 123 199 322 Gallows Corner Industrial Estate ... 154 171 325 Roneo Works 611 500 1,111 Murex Works 1,180 272 1,452 Victor Engineering Works 285 30 315 Abbs Cross Technical School 240 166 406 "Stears Lodge," Harold Wood 20 25 45 "Ravenscourt," Station Lane 7 25 32 Hornchurch Grammar School 209 124 333 Rainham Recreation Ground 150 226 376 Mungo Park Road 150 276 426 South End Road Clinic 57 172 229 Bates Industrial Estate, Harold Wood 235 204 439 Harold Wood Social Centre 160 223 383 Station Road, Harold Wood 136 165 301 Spencers Arms, Ardleigh Green 207 338 545 Plough Inn, Cranham 295 354 649 Avon Road, Cranham 70 275 345 Corbets Tey Road 475 772 1,247 Crown Inn, Roneo Corner 140 155 295 Bull Inn, High Street 628 1,078 1,706 Elm Park Hotel (Car Park) 465 636 1,101 42 These figures total 12,587 (6,117 males, 6,470 females) an increase of 626 compared with the 1962 figures. The figures for 1962 were 11,961; for 1960—9,478; for 1958 8,518; for 1956—8,831 ; and for 1954—5,687. 175 persons were referred for further investigation but Dr. Lawless states that it is likely that the majority of these will turn out to be of little significance.

This important and far-reaching statute came into force on the 1st May, 1964, and is in the main to ensure that in premises to which the Act applies satisfactory conditions are available in relation to the health, welfare and safety of employees. These conditions include, inter-alia cleanlineess, prevention of overcrowding, temperature, ventilation, lighting, sanitary conveniences, washing facilities, drinking water, accommodation for clothing, seating arrangements, seats for sedentary workers, eating facilities, safety of floors, passages and stores, fencing of exposed parts of machinery, first aid, and fire precautions. A considerable amount of extra work was, therefore, thrown on to the department in connection with the registration of premises and their inspection and action in dealing with various contraventions. 153 notices were served during the year. The following is a copy of the return submitted to the Ministry of Labour and National Service for the period 1st May to 31st December, 1964:— TABLE 'A'—REGISTRATIONS AND GENERAL INSPECTIONS.
