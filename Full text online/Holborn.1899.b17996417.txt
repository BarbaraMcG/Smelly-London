HOL 6 BOARD OF WORKS, HOLBORN DISTRICT. METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT, AND PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, Report OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, For the Year ending December 31st, 1899. LONDON: PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE BOARD. 1900. ANNUAL REPORT ON THE VITAL STATISTICS AND SANITARY CONDITION OF THE HOLBORN DISTRICT, For the Year 1899, BY WILLIAM ARTHUR BOND, M.A., M.D., B.C. AND D.P.H.CAMB., M.R.C.P.LOND. Fellow and Member of Council of the Royal Institute of Public Health; Lecturer and Demonstrator of the Sanitary Institute; Fellow of the Society of Medical Officers of Health; Member of the Epidemiological Society, &c., &c.; Medical Officer of Health to the Board of Works for the St. Olave's District, Southwark, and Medical Officer of Health TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE HOLBORN DISTRICT. REPORT RELATING TO THE VITAL STATISTICS AND SANITARY CONDITION OF THE H0LB0RN DISTRICT, LONDON. FOB THE YEAR ENDED 31sr DECEMBER, 1899. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE HOLBORN DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Report for the year ending December 31st, 1899. This Report will show that much work in the abating and removal of insanitary conditions has been carried out in the District during the past year. In comparison with the preceding year the general death-rate, the phthisis, and also the zymotic death rates, are all less. On the other hand, the London general and phthisis death-rates are higher. In the Holborn District, also, the number of notifications of infectious disease was less than that of the preceding year, although for London the number was greater. One hundred and sixty-nine cases of overcrowding were dealt with. The great majority of these were in the Italian Colony, in which night inspections were made on seven occasions. On the first four of these overcrowding was found in each of the 14 houses visited. In one house as many as 4 rooms out of 5 were overcrowded; in one 8 out of 11 rooms ; and in one 6 out of 10 were overcrowded. On the fifth night inspection some overcrowding was found in 2 out of 7 houses visited. On the sixth occasion no overcrowding was found. 4 Medical Officer's Report. On the last occasion 9 houses were inspected to see how far the notices had been complied with. Only 3 out of 40 rooms were then overcrowded. In the one case in which the time given in the statutory notice had expired a summons was taken out, but it was dismissed by the Magistrate. The owners had a printed notice in Itilian and English put up in every room, stating the greatest number of persons allowed by this District Board if used for sleeping and living; also the greatest number if for sleeping only. Much attention was also given to maintain the houses of the Italian Colony in a clean and sanitary state. The Union Buildings Area between Leather Lane and Gray's Inn Road was represented by me under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act. For details see pages 16 to 20. The improvement in the condition of the Meat Market continues, for the amount of diseased meat " seized " was less than that of the preceding year, and less than one-fourth that " seized " in the first quarter of 1896, just after the appointment of the Meat Inspector. The bacteriological examination of doubtful cases of diphtheria has been continued by the Jenner (late British) Institute of Preventive Medicine, at the expense of the Board. Of 109 such cases, the diphtheria bacillus was isolated in 35 of them. The majority of the cases were patients at the London Homceopathic Hospital. This does not include the examination of the doubtful cases that attend the Children's Hospital, which is carried out by their own staff. The Metropolitan Asylums Board was able to receive all the cases of scarlet fever and diphtheria that required to be removed to their hospitals. In October and November on account of the large increase of cases of typhoid fever in London, and notwiihstanding the arrangements made with other hospitals, there was some delay in the removal of a few of our cases. Many of our cases of diphtheria were received at the Children's and Homceopathic Hospitals. The treatment of diphtheria by antitoxic serum still continues to give satisfactory results. Since the 25 th March, 1896, the Board's contract has provided for the removal of house refuse at least once a week. Many of the notices that dust has not been removed show that the contract is not strictly carried out, and the Contractor's attention to the matter has frequently been requested by the Board. The first quarter of the year there was such a large increase in the number of notices that the Contractor was requested to appoint another 5 Medical Officer's Report. foreman to attend to the removal of dust. Although the number of notices the latter half of the year were much diminished, the total for the year was 988; in 1898 the number was 849. However, in 1896 the number was 1,361, and in 1895, as many as 2,114. The Board is endeavouring to have this work and the cleansing of the streets, etc., more satisfactorily carried out by paying the Contractor a larger amount, and by the appointment of an Inspector of Cleansing in addition to the Street Inspector. The Sanitary Committee considered the desirability of the daily removal of stable refuse at the expense of the Board, but on account of the cost that would be incurred it was not recommended. The arrangements made with the Clerkenwell Vestry for articles to be disinfected in their steam apparatus have been continued. The Board's Shelter (conjointly used by the Clerkenwell Vestry) was used by 13 families, consisting of 52 persons, belonging to the District, who slept there during the disinfection of their rooms. SANITARY LEGISLATION, 1899. The following is a short abstract of the sanitary provisions of the Acts that were passed in 1899 affecting the Metropolis:â€” "The Metropolis Water Act, 1899," which enables and requires the Metropolitan Water Companies to supply each other with water in cases of emergency, and to construct the necessary works if so required by the Local Government Board. "The London Government Act, 1899," an Act to make better provision for Local Government in London, by making Metropolitan Boroughs, the Councils of which shall each consist of a Mayor, Aldermen, and Coun. cillors. By this Act the following powers and duties will be transferred from the London County Council to the Borough Councils. The registration of dairymen, and the duty of enforcing the bye-laws and regulations with respect to dairies and milk, and with respect to slaughter houses, knackers' yards, and offensive businesses (Sec. 6 (4) and 2nd Schedule, Part I.). The power to adopt Part III. of the "Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890," that is, the power of providing "lodging houses for the working classes" (2nd Schedule, Part II.). "The Metropolis Management Acts Amendment (Bye-Laws) Act, 1899," authorises the London County Council to make bye-laws requiring 6 Medical Officer's Report. persons about to do any drainage work to deposit with the Sanitary Authority all necessary plans, sections and particulars. "The Seats for Shop Assistants'Act, 1899," provides for seats being supplied in the proportion of not less than one for every three female assistants in each room of retail shops. It is to be enforced by the London County Council. "The Board of Education Act, 1899," provides for the inspection of secondary schools by officers of that Board to ascertain the provisions made for the health of the scholars. "The Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, 1899," empowers Local Authorities (in London any Sanitary Authority) to advance money for enabling persons to acquire the ownership of small houses in which they reside. "The Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899." Abstracts of this Act have already been printed by the Board and distributed in the District to those who sell food or drugs. The Local Government Board issued a circular and orders, together with Model Regulations for Dairies, Cow Sheds and Milkshops, in accordance with the recommendation of the Royal Commission on tuberculosis. By an order of the Home Secretary the 17th March, 1899, all cases of mercurial poisoning contracted in any factory or workshop have to be notified to the Home Office. As the result of an important decision of the Lord Chief Justice in the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court, in the appeal by the London County Council in the case of Logsdon v. Booth, Salvation Army Shelters and similar institutions must be registered as Common Lodging Houses. AREA, POPULATION, HOUSES. The area of the District is 168 acres. The population for 1899, estimated in the usual way to the middle of the year, is 29,853. The number of inhabited houses in the District at the census of 1891 was 3,437. In 1881 the number was 3,244. Although the resident population is diminishing, the "daily" population is increasing, on account of the increase in the number of factories, workshops, and offices. Just half the population (49.8 per cent.), at the census of 1891, occupied tenements of only one or two rooms. 7 Medical Officer's Report. BIRTHS. The total number of births registered during the 5 2 weeks ending December 30th, 1899, were 725, 393 being male and 332 female children; giving a birth-rate of only 24-4 per thousand. The corresponding rate for the whole of Registration London was 29.4. This is the lowest London birth-rate on record. DEATHS. The total number of deaths of persons in the district, after making the usual corrections (i.e. excluding those of persons who died in public institutions, who did not belong to the district, and including those of persons who belong to the district, but died in public institutions outside the district), for the 52 weeks was 716, giving a corrected annual death-rate of 24.1 per thousand. The corresponding rate for London was 19.3. For 1898 the rates were 24 5 and 18.3 respectively, so that although the London death rate has increased, that for the Holborn District has diminished. Further details are given in Tables I. and III. DEATHS OF CHILDREN UNDER ONE YEAR OF AGE. There were 162 deaths of children under one year of age; that is, the number of deaths of children under one year of age to 1000 births was 223. The corresponding rate for London was 167 per 1000 births. In the preceding three years, the numbers in Holborn were, 212 per 1000 births in 1895, 189 in 1896, 181 in 1897, and 219 in 1898. The causes of these 162 deaths were:â€” Premature birth and congenital defects 30 Malnutrition, marasmus and debility 16 Diarrhoea and gastro-enteritis 28 Tubercular diseases 8 Bronchitis 13 Pneumonia 19 Measles 5 Whooping cough 7 Diphtheria 0 Suffocation in bed 7 Convulsions 13 Congenital syphilis 3 Other diseases 13 162 8 Medical Officer's Report. PHTHISIS OR CONSUMPTION. The number of deaths from phthisis during the year was 89, which is equivalent to a death-rate of 2.99 per 1000, rather less than last year, when it was 3.11. The corresponding rate for London was 1.82 per 1000, which is rather more than for 1898, when the rate was 1.72. The number of deaths from other tubercular diseases was 20. The prevention of consumption and other tubercular diseases was considered in my last annual report. INFLUENZA. Influenza was prevalent in the district during the year, the number of deaths assigned to it was 21. The number in London was 1817, the highest number recorded since 1895. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. During the year, the number of deaths from the principal zymotic diseases was 64, the rate being 2.15 per 1000. The corresponding rate for London was 2.46. These rates are less than the corresponding rates for last year, and the Holborn rate is less than that for London. During the past five years the number of deaths was: fromâ€” 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899.

During the year there were notified 258 cases of infectious disease: the corresponding number for 1895, 1896, 1897, and 1898 being 333, 280, 339, and 283 respectively. The numbers of the separate diseases were :â€” 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899.

The "corrected" return for 1898 has not yet been received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board. SCARLET FEVER. One hundred and seventeen cases were notified, and 103 of them were removed to hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board or the London Fever Hospital. There were more notifications of this disease, both in the District and in London, than in 1898. The principal incidence of the disease was from the middle of September to the middle of November. Of the District cases, three died; and of the London cases, 398â€”the smallest number yet recorded. DIPHTHERIA. The number of cases of diphtheria was 63, including one case of membranous croup. Last year the number was 138, and in 1897 it was 158. Of these, 56 were removed to hospitals for treatment. The cases were sparsely scattered throughout the District, two or three cases sometimes occurring in the same house. The number of deaths from diphtheria was 5, or a mortality of only 8 per cent. In London the number of cases notified was 13,701 (including 338 cases of membranous croup), and the number of deaths was 1964, or a mortality of 14.3 per cent. The treatment of diphtheria by its antitoxin continues to give improved results, especially in laryngeal and tracheotomy cases, and those that come under the treatment within two or three days of the onset of the illness. The bacteriological examination of material from doubtful cases of diphtheria has been continued by the Jenner (late British) Institute of Preventive Medicine. Of 109 such cases the diphtheria bacillus was isolated in 35, and the pseudo-diphtheria bacillus, which is non-virulent to animals, was isolated in 13 cases. In the remaining 61 cases it was not isolated. Most of the material was sent by the London Homoeopathic Hospital. At the Hospital for Sick Children, where also many cases of diphtheria from various parts of London are treated, the bacteriological examination is carried out by their own staff. 10 11 Medical Officer's Report. TYPHOID FEVER. Daring the year the number of cases notified was 34, including 2 cases of continued fever, in comparison with 9 in 1898, 25 in 1897, and 30 in 1896. At least 6 of these were probably contracted by direct infection from previous cases. Of these, 2 were nurses and 1 a patient at Hospital, and 2 others had been in attendance on relatives suffering from this disease. In 3 cases there was good evidence that shellfish might have caused the disease. In ODe case the patient washed linen at a public wash-house next to a person who was washing soiled linen from a typhoid patient. Four cases were not contracted in this District. Of the 34 cases, 9 died. In London there were 4529 cases of Fever notified and 804 deathsâ€”large increases in comparison with 1898. MEASLES. The number of deaths assigned to measles was only 11 in comparison with 36 last year, and in London 2143, in comparison with 3075 the previous year. Disinfection is carried out when possible in those cases that come to my knowledge, by obtainiag the addresses of patients attended by the District Medical Officers; also in the cases where death has occurred, as returned by the Registrar, and in the very few cases reported by the teachers of schools. All absences from schools on account of illness ought to be reported to the Medical Officer of Health of the District, and other children in infected houses prohibited from attending schools. As mentioned in other reports, notification by the head of the family ought to be compulsory. WHOOPING COUGH. The death-rate in Holborn from whooping cough was about the same as in London. The number of deaths in Holborn was again only 12. All the deaths were of children under five years of age. The number of deaths in London was 1720. The remarks as to disinfection, &c., after measles, apply also to whooping cough. 12 Medical Officer's Report. DIARRHÅ’A. The number of deaths assigned to diarrhoea was 26, of which 21 were of children under five years of age, the great majority being infants under one year of age, and took place in the third or summer quarter. Of 4196 deaths assigned to diarrhoea in London, 3651 took place in the third quarter, and 3330 were of children under one year of age. The temperature of the summer quarter was 2.80 above the average of the preceding 128 years, and the rainfall of that quarter was very much less than the average. DISINFECTION. During the year ending December, 1899â€” 313 rooms were fumigated and cleansed. The rooms were also stripped and lime-whited when necessary. 2008 articles were disinfected by steam:â€” 181 Beds. 551 Pieces of wearing apparel. 33 Mattresses. 15 Curtains, 107 Bolsters. 2 Rugs. 312 Pillows. 8 Books. 268 Blankets. 49 Sundries. 255 Sheets. 9 Carpets. 179 Quilts. 2008 39 Cushions. Arrangements were made with the Clerkenwell Vestry for articles to be disinfected in their new steam apparatus after the 24th June, 1898. Prior to this the articles were disinfected by Messrs. Armfield & Sons. The family shelter at 47, Northampton Road (conjointly used by the Clerkenwell Vestry) was used for sleeping accommodation by 13 families, consisting of 52 persons, from this District during the disinfection of their rooms. THE MEAT MARKET. During the past four years the amount of meat "seized," offal excluded was:â€” 13 Medical Officer's Report. 1896. Diseased. Decomposed. Total. St. lbs. St. lbs.

The butchers' shops, stalls, slaughter-houses, and also the provision warehouses, &c., were regularly inspected by the Meat Inspector. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. There is a large and increasing number of factories and workships in the District. Many more of these have this year been inspected, and the sanitary defects have been remedied. The Factory Inspectors of the Home Office have supplied us with information concerning a few of these.

"HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890." Union Buildings Area. Aylesbury Place, Clerkenwell, and Union Buildings, Holborn, Improvement Scheme, 1899. In March, 1896, I reported to the Board the greater part of the Union Buildings Area, under Sec. 39, Sub-sec. (1) (6) of the "Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890," which is as follows:â€” "Where it appears to the local authority that the closeness, narrowness, and bad arrangement or bad condition of any buildings, or the want of light, air, ventilation, or proper conveniences, or any other sanitary defect in any Medical Officer's Report. 17 buildings, is dangerous or prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants either of the said buildings or of the neighbouring buildings, and that the demolition, or the reconstruction and rearrangement, of the said buildings or of some of them is necessary to remedy the said evils, and the area comprising those buildings and the yards, outhouses, and appurtenances thereof, and the site thereof, is too small to be dealt with as an unhealthy area under part I. of this Act; "The local authority shall pass a resolution to the above effect, and direct a scheme to be prepared for the improvement of the said area." The following is a short abstract of that report:â€” In nearly all of the houses of this area the drainage is defective; the drains are not ventilated, and in many of them there is no water supply, and other defects. For a large number of the houses and tenements there is not a sufficient w.c. accommodation. In some the w.c.'s are placed in an insanitary position. All the houses of Half-Moon Court, Providence Place, and Dove Court have no ventilation under the ground floors, and no damp courses; the basements of the houses of the area which have them are in a very dirty and insanitary stateâ€”some of them have not been cleansed for several years. Some of the houses in Half-Moon Court, Union Terrace, and Union Buildings have no through ventilation. Many of the rooms in the area are very badly lighted on account of the close proximity of other buildings; some of them being almost in darkness, having only borrowed light. Many of the houses have only small areas at the back, and some have no back area at all. Many of the houses are dangerous on account of fissures in the walls, or the bulging of them in part, or the walls being out of the perpendicular from sinking of the foundations and other causes; or on account of the broken and dilapidated condition of the stairs, passage floors, walls, roofs, or chimneys. Many of the tenements are dangerous to health on account of dampness of the walls. In most, the dustbins are defective; some have no proper dustbins at all. In many, refuse and dust is allowed to accumulate. The paving of the back yards is generally defective, and the yard walls very filthy. 18 Medical Officer's Report. Many of the rain-water pipes and gutters are defective, and in some altogether absent. In some the rain-water pipes are not disconnected from the drains. In many of the tenements the rooms are dangerously overcrowded, and so badly ventilated that on entering one is almost stifled by the foul and poisonous and polluted air. Many of the rooms and passages are in a foul, dirty, and filthy condition, and some have not been cleansed for years. The ground floor of Union Terrace is a large cowshed, and at No. 70, Leather Lane there is an underground bakehouse. On account of our inspection and action with regard to Dove Court, I am glad to learn that these houses are soon to be demolished. A small area, south of Crown Court and to the north of Union Terrace, is already cleared. Many of these grave sanitary, structural, and architectural defects can only be remedied by rearrangement and reconstruction. The only way of effecting a satisfactory and permanent improvement is to treat the whole as an insanitary area, and for this Board to pass a resolution and direct such a scheme to be prepared. If any other course be adopted, at the most only a partial and patchwork amelioration will be the result. New buildings will be more or less unsatisfactorily intermingled with the old, and, like the proposed reconstruction of Dove Court, which has already been sanctioned by the Board, the new paths will be still more devious than the old, and factories or warehouses take the place of dwelling'!. I am sorry I cannot give you the death-rate of this area, as this Board does not possess the requisite death returns, and it was only at the beginning of this year that I obtained the consent of the Sanitary Committee, confirmed by the Board, to have the mortality returns sent to us from the Registrars. I know, however, that in insanitary areas in which statistics have been taken, the death-rate invariably is very high in comparison with that of hygienic and sanitary areas. The population of this area was, at the time of our enumeration, 965 persons, 225 being under 10 years old. Details of the sanitary condition of each of the houses and premises were also given in my report. The following was added in my Annual Report for 1896. Medical Officer's Report. 19 From the death returns of 1896, I find that there were 43 deaths of persons belonging to this area, n of whom died from phthisis, or a death rate of 44.6, and a phthisis death-rate of 11.4 per 1000. But taking into consideration the houses and rooms that were closed, the average population for the year was less than 900: taking it at 900 would give a very high death-rate of 47.8, and a phthisis death-rate of 12.2 per 1000. The above report was considered by the Sanitary Committee and the Board, and it was decided that the sanitary defects should be dealt with under the "Public Health (London) Act, 1891." Notices, accordingly, for every house in the area, were served for the abatement of the insanitary conditions that could be dealt with under that Act The proposed diversion of Dove Court, and erection of a warehouse on part of the site, was abandoned; and instead all the eight houses have been closed; and the four on the north side have been demolished and rebuilt. Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, Half Moon Court, and Nos. 15 and 17, Portpool Lane adjacent, have been closed and demolished, and a large warehouse is now being built on the site. The rooms in Union Buildings in which light and ventilation were defective, are no longer used for human habitation. Most of the back areas are small, and some have no back area at all. The great majority of the houses are let in lodgings, and require constant supervision to maintain in a sanitary state. They are houses which it is desirable to have registered, as they require, at least, a thorough annual cleansing, and the rooms ought to be measured and a record kept of their cubic capacity, so that the landlord may know how many persons each room may at most accommodate, and make it easier for an inspector to know when a room is overcrowded. In 1898, after the appointment of an additional Sanitary Inspector, many of the houses in the area were registered and inspected monthly. Last year preparations were made by the London County Council to include this area, reported in 1896, extended by comprising also the remaining premises in Leather Lane and Portpool Lane as far as the corner of these lanes, and, in addition, Aylesbury Place, Clerkenwell area, in an improvement scheme under Part I. of the Act. The late Medical Officer of Health of Clerkenwell made the representation of the part in that District, and the part in Holborn was represented by me. 20 Medical Officer's Report. The following are the mortality statistics for the Union Buildings area, giving the average general death-rate, phthisis death-rate, and the zymotic death-rate for the four years, 1896-1899, inclusive. I give also the corresponding rates for the Holborn District, and for London as a whole. This Board was not supplied with the details of deaths in the District until the year 1896, so that I can only give the statistics for the four years 1896-1899 inclusive. The population as enumerated by the London County Council in June, 1899, viz., 817, may, I think, be fairly taken as the average of the population during the four years 1896-1899 inclusive, for although the population was greater in the beginning of 1896, the greater part of that year and in 1897 it was less on account of the closing and demolition of parts of the Area. General. Death-rate. Phthisis. Death-rate. Zymotic. Death-rate. Area 48.6* 7 .96* 6.12* Holborn District 23.4 3.11 2.89 London 19.3 1.77 2.45 Per 1,000 persons. * The true death rates of the Area are most probably greater than the above high figures, because a large number of the inhabitants of that Area, when they are ill or infirm, go to Hospitals, Infirmaries, Asylums, and Workhouses, and at death the address is often given as Holbo'n, St. Andrew's, or some other inexact address, and these deaths therefore cannot be included as of persons belonging to the Area. The local inquiry was held at the Holborn Town Hall on the 15th and 16th March, 1900. At this inquiry the past and present District Poor Law Medical Officers, Dr. Gabe and Dr. Gahagan, gave evidence of the large proportion of sickness, especially phthisis or consumption, other respiratory diseases and zymotic diseases, that had been prevalent amongst persons living in the Area. Many other witnesses (including Dr. Hamer, Assistant Medical Officer of Health to the London County Council, and myself) were also examined and cross-examined. 21 Medical Officer's Report.

The Smoke Inspector, Mr. Thomas Madden, reports that there are 56 furnaces and boilers on the register, and that he makes periodical inspection of them to see that they are in a proper working order, and consume their own smoke. There are 9 kinds of smoke consumers in the District, which are as follows:â€” Ventilated Doors 4 Dr. Annan's Patent 3 Nicholson's â€ž 3 Caddy's â€ž Bars 2 Juke's â€ž 2 Galloway's â€ž 6 Gregory and Veal's Patent 1 Gosling's Patent 2 Total of Smoke Consumers 35 The number of furnaces and boilers without smoke consumers is 21, The 13 furnaces that were at Reid's Brewery have been removed from the register, as the premises were closed in September, and are now being demolished. During the year 3 new smoke consumers have been supplied. Six preliminary, 5 recurring, and 2 statutory notices were served to abate smoke nuisances, and were all complied with. THE MORTUARY. There were 158 bodies brought into the mortuary from 1st January to December 31st, 1899. Coroner's inquests were held on 63 of these. 24 Medical Officer's Report. The verdicts were:â€” Natural causes 44 Accidental Death 8 Suffocation 9 Suicide 2 Total 63 METEOROLOGY. Details' are given in Table VI. The mean temperature for the year was 50.6Â° F., or 1.9Â° F. above the mean of the preceding 128 years. The rainfall was 22.34 inches, being 2.50 inches below the average of the preceding 84 years.
