The snow was removed by the Contractors of the Board under their contract, a number of additional carts being engaged in the work. The cost paid by the Board amounted to £1 4s. 10d. STREET NOMENCLATURE. Orders having been made by the Metropolitan Board of Works for the renumbering of the houses in Hose Lane, and Butcher liow, Ratcliff, notices were served upon the owners of the houses in such streets respectively, requiring them to paint or affix the new numbers as ordered, and the-same have been complied with. An order was also made by the Metropolitan Board of Works for renumbering the houses in Urgent Street, London Street, and The Opening, Ratcliff; for abolishing the names Regent Street and The Opening, and for renaming the whole line of thoroughfare from Commercial Road to Narrow Street, "London Street, E." Notices were served upon the several owners requiring them to paint or affix the new numbers as ordered, and the same have been complied with, and the name " London Street" has been painted up. IMPROVEMENTS. Messrs. Good and Son having made an offer to set back their new Ropery No. 591, Commercial Road, Ratcliff, so as to line with the existing premises at the East and West ends, and to give up the Piece of ground in front of same without payment, and a letter having been received from the clerk to the Mercers' Company, the freeholders of the property, to the effect that the Company were willing to give up the piece of land in question, to be used as part of the public thoroughfare, the Board accepted the offer, and have thrown the same into the public footway, and paved it. A similar arrangement was also made with Messrs. Good and Son to set hack the line of frontage of the new boundary wall, so as to line with the premises on the North and South sides thereof, at the rear, in Belgrave Street, of their premises No. 591, Commercial Road, Ratcliff; and the Mercers' Company having consented thereto, the surplus piece of land has been thrown into the public footway, and paved by the Board. The carriageway st the north end of Here Street, Ratcliff, has been widened so as to allow two vehicles to pass at a time, and to prevent vehicles damaging the footway. The Hoard having been informed that the Police authorities were about to erect a new station in Birchfield Street, within this district, negociations were entered into with the Receiver of Police for the new boundary wall, at the corner of Amoy Place and Birchfield Street, to be set back to correspond with the building line at the north end of the Street, and the Receiver agreed to surrender the piece of ground required to be thrown into the public-way, upon payment of a sum of £50. The land in question being partly in this District and partly in Poplar, the Board resolved to carry out the improvement if the Poplar District Board would pay one half the consideration money, and one-half the cost of altering the roads and footpath when the boundary wall was set back, and the Poplar Board agreed to this arrangement. The Home Secretary subsequently sanctioned the conveyance, by the Receiver of Police, of the land required for the improvement, and the matter will now be completed in due course. The premises No. 107, Three Colt Street, Limehouse, having been damage by fire, negociations were entered into by the Board with the owner thereof, for the purpose of setting back the lino of frontage to line with the fronts of the existing houses adjoining thereto. The Board agreed to give the sum of £30 for the surplus land, and the conveyance having been completed, the same was thrown into the public footway and paved by the Board. TRAMWAYS—WEST INDIA DOCK ROAD & BURDETT ROAD. The North Metropolitan Tramways Company being of arranging for the cars running to Victoria Park to start from the West India Docks and pass throgh the west India Dock Road direct to Mile End Road and Victoria Park, instead Of standing at the south end of Burdett Road as before, and to discontinue the service from West India Docks to Aldgate, applied to the Board for their consent to the proposal, stating that they were prepared to enter into an arrangement as to a revision of fares and otherwise as might be acceptable to the Board. The 24th Section of the North Metropolitan Tramways Art, 1884, provides that the line of tramway between the West India Dock Road and Burdett Road should not be used without the previous consent in writing of the Road Authority, under their common seal, and such user was subject to conditions and restrictions as might be specified therein by that Authority. As directed by the Board, I put myself in communication with the Manager of the Tramways Company, with a view to arranging for the adoption of penny fares for short distances, and in the result the Board gave the consent required, subject to certain conditions and restrictions as to fares and otherwise. NORTH METROPOLITAN TRAMWAYS PROVISIONAL ORDER. The North Metropolitan Tramways Company deposited plans for the construction of a tramway from the junction of the proposed tramway in Commercial Street. Whitechapel, and passing thence into and along Leman Street and Dock Street and terminating in the latter street at or near the south end thereof, the principal portion of the tramway being in the Whitechapel District, and a very short length in the Limehouse district. I was directed to negociate with the Tramways Company, with a view to the insertion in the Order of Clauses for the protection of the District. which were agreed to by the Tramways Company, and inserted in the Order. HYDE PARK CORNER (NEW STREETS) BILL. The attention of the Board was called to the alterations made in the Hyde Park Corner (New Streets) Bill, as sent up from the House of Commons by the Committee of the House of Lords, by which alterations it was proposed to make the Metropolitan Board of Works contribute towards the maintenance of street in the Parishes of St. Martin-in-the-Fields and St.George Hanover Square, and a circular letter from the Clerk to the Vestry of Islington, forwarding copy letter addressed by that Vestry to the Members of Parliament for the Borough of Islington was read. The Board directed that a letter be addressed to the Members of Parliament for the several Divisions of the Borough of the Tower Hamlets, requesting them to oppose the amendments of the Mouse of Lords to the Bill, and, if possible, to obtain the support of the other Metropolitan Members in so doing. The Bill was subsequently restored by the House of Lords to the form in which it was passed by the House of Commons. STOPPAGE OF SALMON STREET, LIMEHOUSE. Application was made by the School Board for London for the consent of this Board to the stoppage of part of Salmon Street, Limehouse, comprised within the limits of deviation shewn in the plan accompanying the application, and requesting the Board to take the necessary steps to obtain an Order of the Justices functioning the same, under Sec. 79, of 57 George 3rd, cap. XXIX. The Board consented to the stoppage, subject to the School Board acquiring the houses fronting Salmon Street on both sides, and directed that the neccssary steps be taken to obtain an Order of Justice. MARKET RIGHTS AND TOLLS. A Royal Commission having been appointed to consider the question of Market Rights and Tolls, I suggested that evidence as to the London Riverside Fish Market at Shadwell should be given before the Commissioners and I was requested by the Board to attend and give evidence if requested by the Commission. The Chairman and Secretary of the Market having been requested to attend and give evidence, I communicated with them as to the several points upon which information should be given to the Commission, and they having given such evidence it was unnecessary for me to attend and repeat it. VENTILATION OF SEWERS. In view of the nuisance likely to arise from the escape of noxious effluvia from the ventilating shafts of the Main Sewers within the District during the hot weather, the Board requested the Metropolitan Board of Works to deodorize the sewage passing through the Main Sewers as they did in the three previous years. A letter was subsequently received from the Clerk of the Metropolitan Board, stating that instructions had been given to the Engineer of that Board for the application of sulphurous acid for the neutralisation of sewer gases in the event of complaint being made of offensive smells arising from the ventilating shafts of the Main Sewers. THE IRON BRIDGE, BARKING ROAD. On the 28th March, 1887. a screw collier passing down the River Lee fouled the Iron Bridge over the Leo, and did so much damage to the structure that the closing of the bridge against traffic was necessary while the bridge was temporarily shored up. It appeared to the Board that the cost of reinstating the bridge would amount to a considerable sum, and that requisitions had been made by various authorities to the Justices of the Peace for the County of Middlesex, asking them, in conjunction with the Justices for Essex, to construct an entirely new bridge of sufficient width, and suitable for the traffic of the present day, and with convenient gradients; and the Board directed that a memorial be presented to the Middlesex Magistrates to the same effect which memorial was referred by the Justices to their Committee of Accounts. ARTIZANS AND LABORERS DWELLINGS ACTS. CABLE STREET AREA. A Provisional Order in this Scheme was made by the Home "Secretary and presented to Parliament for confirmation according to the Provisions of the Act of 1875. I am, Gentlemen, Your moat obedient Sonant, CHARLES DUNCH, Surveyor of the Board. BOARD OF WORKS for the LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER of HEALTH for the year 1887. TO THE B0ARD OF WORKS for the LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Report on the Health and Sanitary Condition of the Limehouse District for the year 1887. During the year in question there were registered in the District 420 marriages, a number which exceeded that registered in the previous year by 20, but which falls considerably short of the average of the last ten years. The Marriage Rate in the District was 14 persons per 1,000 population, while in London it was 16.2 per 1,000, the lowest Marriage Rate yet recordod in London. The Births registered in the District numbered 2,064, a number somewhat below the average of the last ten years, and corresponding to an annual Birth Rate of 35 per 1,000, that of London having been 31.7 per 1,000 inhabitants. The Deaths registered in the District exclusive of those of non-residents which occurred in Public Institutions situated in the District, but inclusive of those of residents which occurred in Public Institutions situated beyond the limits of the District numbered 1,450, and corresponded to a death rate of 24.7 per 1,000 population, that of London having been 19.6 per 1,000, and of the Eastern Districts 21.9 per 1,000. The Deaths of Children under five years numbered 626, of which 3G3 were those of children under one year. 2 The Deaths in Public Institutions, both within and without the District of persons ordinarily resident in the District numbered 349. and comprise 35 in the East London Children's Hospital (the total number therein being 228). 227 in the Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum; 43 in the London Hospital; 13 in the Homerton Fever Hospital; 11 in the Stepney Workhouse; 3 in the London Fever Hospital, besides others in the Stockwell Fever Hospital, German Hospital, Middlesex, King's and Guy's Hospitals. The Deaths from DISEASES op A ZYMOTIC CHARACTER were 249, and included 58 from Measles, 27 from Scarlet Fever. 65 from Whooping Cough, 10 from Diphtheria. 6 from Enteric Fever, and 67 from Diarrhoea. No death from Smallpox was registered during the year. The Deaths from Measles exceeded the average of the last ten years by 11.5, and were 19 more than in the previous year. Those from Scarlatina were below the decennial average by 24.9, but exceeded the number in the previous year by 4. The deaths from Diphtheria exhibit a slight increase on the ten years average, and were 3 more than in 1886. Whooping Cough which caused deaths appears to have Wen more fatal than in any year since 1882, when 113 deaths were registered; it also caused a mortality of 7.6 above the decennial average. The deaths from Enteric Fever were considerably below the average of the last ten years, and about a third only of those registered in the previous year. Diarrhoea also, though causing a mortality somewhat higher than the ten years average, exhibited a decline of 13 deaths on the number registered in 1886. The age of greatest mortality from Measles was that from 1 to 5 years, when 42 perished; of Scarlet Fever from 1 to 5 years, when 14 deaths were recorded ; of Whooping Cough from 1 to 5 years, when 37 were registered; while the greatest period of mortality from Diarrhoea was that between birth and 1 year, when 47 of the total 67 deaths were recorded. Constitutional Diseases caused a mortality of 250, and included 22 deaths from Cancer, 602 from Tabes Mesenterica, 32 from Tubercular Meningitis, and 113 from Phthisis. The period of greatest mortality from Cancer was between the ages of 45 and 55 years, when 9 deaths were recorded. This disease judging from the number of deaths appears to bo more frequent than it was only six or seven years ago, although the mortality in 1885 from this cause exceeded that in 1887, by 11. The deaths from Cancer in the five years 1877-1881, both inclusive, averaged 13 a year, while in the five years 1882-1886 they averaged 26 a year. Developmental Diseases caused 121 deaths, which, as regards cause, are divided mainly between Premature Birth and Old Age. Local Diseases proved fatal to 714 persons, and included 141 from affections of the Nervous System ; 93 from Diseases of the Circulatory System; 357 from Pulmonary Complaints; 73 from 3 Digestive Disorders; 33 from Diseases of the Urinary System ; 6 from affections connected with Child Birth, and 11 from Diseases of Bones, Joints and Integuments. Affections of the Circulatory System would appear to be much on the increase. I find that the average mortality from this class of disease for the last ten years is 58, while in the year under consideration it is as stated before, 93. In 1886 it was 84, and in 1885, 96. The Deaths from Violence numbered 65, of these 20 were due to Fractures and Contusions, 7 to Burns and Scalds, 33 to Drowning, and 4 to Suffocation. The Deaths from Debility numbered 43. Infectious Sickness. One case of Smallpox came under my observation; the patient was an Asiatic staying at the Strangers' Home in the West India I Dock Road. The disease declared itself on 25th October. He had been an inmate of the home since 23rd August, and stated that he had been vaccinated three years previously. He was removed to Hospital, and the usual steps taken against a spread of the disease. No other case occurred. Measles prevailed for the first six months of the year. Seventyone case came to my knowledge during the year, and of these 58 were reported as deaths; of course these 71 cases do not represent more than a very small proportion of the number that actually occurred. The disease is however, sufficiently fatal to merit more attention than it receives, and to cause greater fear of its infection. Too frequently the practice is followed of purposely spreading the disease to all the younger members of a family, with the object of getting over what is thought to be an inevitable and simple ailment; the result is frequently disastrous and leads me to view this complaint on sanitary grounds, as worthy to be classed among dangerous infectious disorders. As it is, in the year under consideration its mortality was more than twice that of Scarlatina. One bundled and nineteen cases of Scarlatina came to my knowledge, of which number 72 were treated in Hospital; of these 11 patients non-resident in the District were sent by the authorities of the East London Children's Hospital; of the 27 deaths from this disease 11 occurred in the Fever Hospital, and the remainder in the District. Thirty-nine cases of Enteric Fever came under my notice, of these 23 were removed to Hospital, where two died; of the remainder treated at home, four died. In other words, of those treated in Hospital, 9 per cent died, while of those treated at home 25 per cent. died. With regard to Scarlatina the death rate of those treated in the Hospital was 15 per cent, while of those treated in their own homes the rate was 34 per cent. Surely these facts point to the 4 necessity for early information of all such diseases in order that stops may be taken for placing the patient under circumastances the most favourable for recovery, and for the limitation of the area of the disease. A case of Typhus was reported on December 6th, the patient was a lad aged 16, residing in Union Terrace Eastfield Street; the family which was a large one,living in two small rooms, was in poverty, and had undergone privation for some weeks; the patient, who was a rag sorter at a place in the neighbourhood,was removed to Hospital. Sanitary Work. Your Sanitary Stair has been engaged in the ordinary routine inspection throughout the year. In net I may say that in no previous year have the inspection numerous or the work performed more continuous. As you may see from an examination of Table VI. 4,215 houses and premises were inspected, of which 1,270 were re inspected; 3,717 orders for amendments of houses were issued ; 258 premises were cleansed and whitewashed, and 191 houses were disinfected after sickness of an infectious character; 466 house drains were repaired, cleansed , and trapped; yards were paved and received and 1,973closets were supplied with water. The work in this respect entitled much labour on the inspectors, as a great opposition and prejudice on the part of owners of property had to be overcome. The provisions of the Canal Boat Act have been carried out as well as the difficulties surrounding such duties have permitted; 88 boats were inspected, and I personally examined and reported on between 30 and 40. The Bakehouses and the licensed Cowsheds and Slaughterhouses have also been regularly inspected. In addition to the carrying out of the.se duties, 4,844 articles of clothing and bedding were disinfected, free of charge, in the apparatus belonging to the Board, and returned to their owners. Messrs. Wickens Pease & co. were subjects of complaint on many occasions. You are aware that they are the owners of tho Bone Boiling Works at Broad Bridge, Shad well, a business certain to be the cause of complaint, unless every precaution to prevent a nuisance be taken. I have described the process to which the bones are subjected to you often, and there is no reason to repeat it bore. I he nuisance arose principally from three points of the factory, viz. the place where the bones were deposited on their arrival, the place where they were boiled, and the bone-hole or receptacle where they were dried; by far the greater nuisance arose from the boiling place and the bone-hole. The former has now been enclosed, and the effluvium from the latter drawn by a fan and discharged Into the boiler furnace.The result is an abatement of the nuisance.I have reason to believe that the place of deposit of bones on their arrival will be enclosed. 5 Certain houses in Shadwell, viz. 8,9, 10, Lalbour-inVain Street, and 6, 7, and 8, Brewhouse Street, adjoining properties, having fallen into a bad structural condition, and bring unfit for human habitation, were closed by a Magistrate's order, and ultimately demolished by the owners. The Sewer emanations in Wapping have caused a great deal of trouble at short intervals during the year. The smell resembled that of paraffin, and combined with the usual noxious effluvium from the sewer ventilators wan particularly offensive. The Engineer of the Metropolitan Board was notified on several occasions when the smell was very bad, but although steps were taken to trace the cause they were without result; complaints of effluvium from sewers in other portions of the District were frequent, and the Metropolitan Board was requested by your Board to continue the deodorization of the sewers, which had been practised during the hot weather of the preceding year with good effect. Messrs. Schofield & White's Manure Manufactory, St. Paul's Road, the Fur Dressing premises in Gill Street, and the Animal Charcoal Works in New Gravel Lane, all came under my inspection, the latter on several occassions. The smell from this place was frequently most pungent and disagreeable. On one occasion I found a large accumulation of offensive bones both inside and outside the bone hole, the doors of which were wide open. The only way to keep this place in anything like order is to make frequent inspections. For some time past these premises have been visited three times a week, and the result is satisfactory. The Limehouse Cut came under my observation several times during the year, but until the hot weather set in there was no effluvium. An examination made in August revealed the condition of the water, which was anything but satisfactory. It was turbid, of a greenish tinge, with an unpleasant odour, and contained a large quantity of dark offensive matter, and was largely contaminated with sewage. The water was examined again in October, when the weather was cooler, and though impure it was not in a condition to affect injuriously the health of the District. On 16th November your Hoard passed the following resolution : "That in the interests of the Public Health, and to enable Nuisance Authorities to discharge the duty of checking and preventing the spread of infectious diseases such as Smallpox, Fever, Ac., provision should bo made by legislative enactment to secure the compulsory disclosure to the said authorities of all cases of such diseases immediately upon their occurrence." A copy of this resolution was ordered to be forwarded to the Local Government Board. The importance of this resolution it is difficult to over estimate, and should it with the others of a like character passed by various nuisance authorities have the effect of producing legislative enactment, a weapon such as they have never had before will be put into the 6 hands of such authorities, with which they should be able to combat infectious disease under conditions far more advantageous than any hitherto existing. Sale of Food and Drugs' Act. One hundred and four samples of Food were examined at the Laboratory during the year, vie., twelve of bread all unadulterated; eight of butter, one of which was adulterated with 33 per cent. of Foreign fat; two of cocoa, both mixed with starch and sugar; eleven of mustard, two of which were adulterated with wheat flour, and coloured with turmeric; four of beer, all of good quality: thirty of milk, three of which were adulterated with water, in the proportion of 40 per cent, 23 per cent, and 12 per cent, respectively; ten of pepper, two of which were adulterated with ground rice; two of arrowroot, both genuine; one of condensed milk, of fair quality; eight of coffee, one of which contained 80 per cent, of chicory; four of gin, one of which had be. n reduced hy water somewhat below the standard pr< ribed by the Act ; nine of whisky, two of which had been reduced by the addition of water, slightly below the standard; one of porter, of a satisfactory quality, and two of flour, both genuine. I have pleasure in acknowledging the great assitance I have received from the Inspectors, who have performed their duties in an intelligent and satisfactory manner.
