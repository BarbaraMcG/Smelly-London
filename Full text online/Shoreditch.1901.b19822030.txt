ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER or HEALTH. public health department, town hall, old street, e.c., January, 1902. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch. sir, and gentlemen, This report relates to the public health and vital statistics of the Borough of Shoreditch for the year ending December 31st, 1901. POPULATION. According to the figures of the census taken on April 1st, 1901, there has been a marked decrease both in the number of persons resident in Shoreditch and in the number of inhabited houses during the decienial period 1891—1901. Allowing for the changes in the area of the Borough due to the alterations made in the boundaries consequent upon the passing of the London Government Act, 1899, the decrease in the population amounts to 6,090 and in the number of inhabited houses to 1,105. 2 The total area of the Borough is stated to be 657.6 acres including 6.4 acres of water in Hoxton New Town, 2.6 in Old Town and 6.1 in Haggerston. The total number of persons in Shoreditch on the night of the census was 118,637, of whom 58,149 were males and 60,088 females. The density of the population per acre for for the whole Borough was 180 in 1901, as compared with 189 in 1891. The inhabited houses in the Borough numbered 12,743, as compared with 13,848 in 1891. The number of families or separate occupiers in Shoreditch is given at 27,091, of which 3,654 were in Shoreditch South, 6,951 in Hoxton New Town, 6,409 in Hoxton Old Town and 10,017 in Haggerston. In the Hoxton Parliamentary Division there were 6,122 inhabited houses and 62,429 persons, and in the Haggerston Division 6,525 and 55,277 respectively. The numbers of inhabited houses and the populations in the various Wards of the Borough are as set out below:— Ward. Inhabited Houses. Population. Male. Female. Total. Acton 1,612 5,972 6,479 12,451 Church 2,063 10,297 10,526 20,823 Haggerston 1,469 5,921 6,113 12,034 Hoxton 1,885 5,419 9,689 19,108 Kingsland 1,463 5,662 6,001 11,663 Moorfields 607 3,188 3,243 6,431 Wenlock 1,672 8,431 8,871 17,302 Whitmore 1,972 9,259 9,566 18,825 The number of persons in the public institutions within the Borough on the night of the census, were as follows: Convent Hospital, 24; Hoxton House Asylum, 120; Holborn Workhouse, 1,375; Royal Hospital for Diseases of the Chest, 68; and Shoreditch Workhouse and Infirmary, 1,254. Of the 27,031 tenements in Shoreditch, 22,940, or 84.9 per cent., were of less than five rooms. The average percentage of such tenements for the County of London was 65.9. In the subjoined table, which is taken from the first instalment of the detailed abstract of the census returns, are contained the number of tenements of less than five rooms and the number of persons occupying them. Rooms in Tenement. Tenements of less than 5 Rooms. Number of Persons living in each Tenement. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 6705 2042 2358 1318 678 216 73 12 5 3 ... ... ... 2 7509 317 1488 1769 1496 1136 694 380 155 48 21 4 1 3 5102 84 572 819 889 865 759 532 313 175 64 21 9 4 3624 28 224 381 550 601 592 483 354 237 104 43 27 3 The proportion of single room tenenents was 24.8 per cent. as compared with 14-7 per cent. for all London. High though this proportion is, it is satisfactory to note that it is less than in 1891. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the bulk of the population of Shoreditch were found on the night of the census to be living in tenements of less than five rooms, and over fifteen thousand persons were dwelling in one room tenements. This fact should be borne in mind when considering statistics relating to diseases and deaths. The number of persons in Shoreditch in the middle of the year 1901, is estimated at 118,550, distributed in the four Registration Sub-Districts as follows:—Shoreditch South, 16,276; Hoxton New Town, 29,732; Hoxton Old Town, 26,480; and Haggerston, 46,062. In Hoxton New Town is situate the Holborn Union Workhouse, the inmates of which are not persons belonging to Shoreditch; these averaged during the year, 1,388. For certain statistical purposes they are not included in the Shoreditch population, and the number of persons in the Hoxton New Town Registration SubDistrict becomes therefore for these purposes 28,344, and the population for the whole Borough 117,162. BIRTHS. The number of births registered during the year 1901 was 4,120—2152 were male, and 1,968 female. In the Shoreditch Infirmary there were 71 births—37 of males and 34 of females. Of these 26 were entered as legitimate, and 45 illegitimate. In the Holborn Union Workhouse, there were 95 births, of which 60 were illegitimate. The male births numbered 46, and the female 49. The distribution of the births in the Borough, in the four Registration Sub-Districts, was as set out below. Registration Sub-District. Males. Females. Total. Shoreditch South 251 238 489 Hoxton New Town 537 523 1,060 Hoxton Old Town 511 444 955 Haggerston 853 763 1,616 Total 2,152 1,968 4,120 Deducting the births in the Holborn Union Workhouse, as the mothers were not persons belonging to Shoreditch, the birth-rate was 34.3 per 1,000 inhabitants, as compared with 29.0 for the Metropolis. The births in Shoreditch were 1,420 in excess of the deaths. A comparison of the birth-rates in the Registration Sub-Districts is contained in table VI (see appendix). Since 1883 the birth-rate of Shoreditch has been decreasing. MARRIAGES. The number of marriages registered in Shoreditch during the year 1901 was 1,073, as compared with 1,157 in 1900 and 1,295 in 1899. The number of persons married was at the rate of 18.2 per 1,000 inhabitants as compared with 17.1 per 1,000 for the Metropolis. 4 DEATHS. The deaths of persons belonging to Shoreditch numbered 2,596; their distribution amongst males and females in the four Registration Sub-Districts is as set out in the subjoined table:— Registration Sub-District. Males. Females. Total. Shoreditch South 196 183 379 Hoxton New Town 317 298 615 Hoxton Old Town 307 277 584 Haggerston 538 480 1,018 Total 1,358 1,238 2,596 The deaths of males exceeded those of females by 120. The death-rate for the year was 22.1 per 1,000 inhabitants being, 0.7 below the average for the previous ten years. The death-rate for London during 1901 was 17.6 per 1,000 and that of England and Wales, 16.9. The death-rates of the male and female populations of Shoreditch were 23.6 and 20.7 per 1,000 respectively. Tables shewing an analysis and comparison of the death-rates, the age distribution, and the causes of death amongst males and females are contained in the appendix see tables IV, V and VI. The death-rate locally was highest in Shoreditch South and lowest in Hoxton New Town. There was a sharp rise in the death-rate in the latter half of the month of February owing to the prevalence of chest diseases. The rate was low in June, but diarrhoea during the latter half of July and the beginning of August sent it up again. The death-rate remained slightly below the average for the year during September and October, but diseases of the chest caused rises during November and December. The deaths of infants under the age of one year numbered 812—of these 446 were of males and 366 females. The chief causes of death were diarrhoea, tuberculosis in its various forms, bronchitis, pneumonia, prematurity and debility at birth and marasmus. Of 144 deaths ascribed to prematurity and debility at birth 89 were of males and 55 females. Accident or negligence resulted in 39 deaths, of which 36 were attributed to suffocation in bed. Deaths of infants under one year formed 31.2 per cent. of the total number of deaths. The infant mortality, or the number of deaths of infants under one year per the number of births which occurred during the year, was 201. The infant mortality for the Metropolis was 149. As has been pointed out in previous reports Shoreditch has a high infant mortality such as is usually to be met with in densely populated working-class districts. The deaths of children aged 1 to 5 years numbered 366. The chief causes of death during this age period were measles, scarlet fever, whooping cough,, diphtheria, 5 diarrhoea, various forma of tuberculosis, bronchitis and pneumonia; violence through accidents or negligence resulted in 14 deaths 9 of which were through burns or scalds. Altogether 1,178 or 453 per cent of the total number of deaths were of children under 5 years of age. Of Children aged between 5 and 15 years, 73 died, chiefly from the various infectious diseases, including 17 deaths attributed to tuberculosis. Of persons aged between 15 and 25 years, 99 died, the chief causes of death being consumption, diseases of the nervous system and heart disease. The deaths among persons aged from 25 to 35 years numbered 135, the principal causes of death being tuberculosis including 47 from consumption, heart disease, pneumonia and other diseases of the respiratory organs and Bright's disease. The deaths of persons aged between 35 and 45 years numbered 187, the chief causes being consumption, which claimed 71 victims, diseases of the nervous system, heart disease, diseases of the respiratory organs and Bright's disease. Cancer was given as the cause of 10 deaths, and cirrhosis of the liver and alcoholism of 9 deaths. Of persons aged between 45 and 55 years 243 died, the chief causes being consumption, which resulted in 62 deaths, cancer which caused 21, diseases of the nervous system including 10 from apoplexy, heart disease, bronchitis and pneumonia, cirrhosis of the liver and alcoholism, and Bright's disease. There were 262 deaths of persons aged between 55 and 65 years, 4 of these were due to erysipelas, 20 to consumption, 21 to cancer, 34 to apoplexy, 15 to other diseases of the nervous system, 35 to heart disease, 80 to diseases of the respiratory system, 6 to cirrhosis of the liver and alcoholism, and 17 to Bright's disease. Of persons between the ages of 65 and 85 there were 398 deaths, of which 6 were attributed to consumption, 5 to gout, 19 to cancer, 92 to old age, 33 to apoplexy, 13 to other diseases of the nervous system, 45 to heart disease, 115 to diseases of the respiratory system, 5 to cirrhosis of the liver and alcoholism, 16 to Bright's disease and 17 to accident or injury due to negligence including 12 through falls. Of the 21 deaths amongst persons aged 85 and upwards, 10 were attributed to old age, 1 to senile gangrene, 1 to heart disease, 4 to bronchitis, 2 to ill-defined diseases of the digestive organs, 1 to Bright's disease, and 2 to falls. The chief causes of death were tuberculosis including consumption which accounted for 363 deaths, bronchitis and pneumonia which resulted in 557 deaths, diarrhoea which caused 153 deaths, and heart disease which accounted for 145 deaths 6 Prematurity and debility at birth were given as the cause of 144 deaths, 113 were stated to be due to atrophy, debility, and marasmus, all children under 5 years of age, and 106 were attributed to old age. Cancer oaused 74 deaths, 31 of males and 43 of females. With tho exception of 6 they were all of persons aged between 35 and 75 years. The death-rate attributable to cancer was 068 per 1000 inhabitants as compared with 0.56 for 1900. In addition to the deaths given as due to cancer there were 21, 14 of males and 7 of females, attributed to malignant disease. These have not been included in calculating the cancer death-rate. The deaths directly attributed to alcoholism numbered 13, but as stated in previous reports this figure is far from indicating the actual number of deaths which have resulted from the abuse of alcohol. DEATHS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. The numbers and distribution of the deaths of persons, belonging and not belonging to the Borough, in public institutions in Shoreditch, are set out in the subjoined table:— Institution. Persons belonging to Shoreditch. Persons not belonging to Shoreditch. Total. Holborn Union Workhouse 4 305 309 Shoreditch Workhouse 431 11 442 Hoxton House Asylum 6 39 45 Royal Chest Hospital 13 66 79 Convent Hospital 2 6 8 Total 456 427 883 The alterations in the boundaries of the Borough under the London Government Act, 1899, caused the transfer of the North Eastern Hospital for Children situate in Goldsmith Row, Hackney Road, to the Borough of Bethnal Green, and the Royal Hospital for Diseases of the Chest in the City Road to Shoreditch. Elsewhere than in public institutions 5 persons not belonging to Shoreditch died within the Borough. In the following table are set forth the various public institutions outside Shoreditch, with the number of persons belonging to the Borough dying therein;— 7 No. of Asylums. Deaths.

Elsewhere than in public institutions, 10 persons belonging to Shoreditch died beyond the limits of the Borough. Altogether during 1901, 821 persons belonging to Shoreditch died in public institutions. SICKNESS AMONGST THE POOR. During the year 1901 some 3,383 cases of illness came under the care of the district medical officers at the parish dispensary, as compared with 3,267 cases in 1900. An analysis of the cases is contained in Table VII (see Appendix). Diseases of the respiratory organs were responsible for a large proportion of the cases, of which 872 were acute and chronic bronchitis. There were also a considerable number of 8 cases of pneumonia. Cases of the various infectious diseases were fairly numerous, a large proportion being phthisis or consumption; influenza, measles and diarrhœa were also common complaints. Nearly 300 persons sought treatment for various forms of rheumatism, and 200 for disorders connected with the nervous system. Cases in which various disorders of the digestive system, chiefly dyspepsia were recognised, were common. Diseases connected with the locomotive system were not quite so numerous as last year, still, they caused 148 persons to seek treatment. The commonest cause of trouble in these cases was ulceration of the legs. Skin diseases were the complaints in 117 cases, and 119 cases were due to injury. The cases diagnosed as cancer numbered 31, as compared with 33 in 1900, 18 in 1899, 9 in 1898, 15 in 1897, 21 in 1896, 15 in 1895, 27 in 1894, and 23 in 1893. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. The various infectious diseases, numbered 1 to 35 in Table V (see Appendix), caused 762 deaths, or 29.3 per cent. of the total number of deaths from all causes. The death-rate due to these diseases was 6.5 per 1,000 inhabitants. The distribution of the deaths according to ages is as shown in the subjoined table:— Age period Under 1 1-5 5-10 10-15 15-20 20-25 25-35 35-45 45-55 55-65 65-75 75-85 No. of deaths 227 189 24 13 24 24 64 84 70 28 7 8 From the above table it will be seen that deaths from infectious disease were proportionately much more numerous during the first year of life, than during any age period subsequently. This is the result of infantile diarrhoea and tuberculosis mainly. Measles, whooping-cough, diphtheria, diarrhoea and tuberculosis are the chief causes of the heavy mortality during the age period 1 to 5 years. Altogether, of the 762 deaths from infections diseases, 416 were of children under five years of age. After the age of five years the deaths become markedly fewer, until a minimum is reached during the 10 to 15 years age period. For the next ten years deaths from infectious diseases are somewhat higher, but on the whole they are not numerous. Then follows a rise in the numbers reaching a maximum in the 35 to 45 years period. This rise is the result of the mortality due to phthisis or consumption of the lungs, the commonest form of tuberculosis. The deaths are still numerous in the next age period, but after that they again fall off in number. Up to 75 years phthisis or consumption remains the commonest cause of death amongst infectious diseases, after that age, diarrhœa. There were no deaths of persons over 85 years of age registered as due to any of the infectious diseases. Deaths from small-pox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, including membranous croup, whooping cough, enteric fever and diarrhoea numbered 349, and the deathrate due to these diseases, usually termed the zymotic death-rate, was 2.9 per 1,000 9 inhabitants, as compared with 3.1 in 1900, 3.6 in 1899, 4.2 in 1897, 4.3 in 1896, and 3.8 in 1895. A comparison of the zymotic death-rates of London and Shoreditch with its Registration Sub-Districts is contained in Table VI (see appendix). The eases of notifiable infectious disease certified during the year 1901 numbered 1,146. The numbers of cases certified since 1889, when the notification of certain infectious diseases became compulsory, together with the attack-rates per 1,000 inhabitants are as contained in the subioined table:— Year. Number of cases. Attack rate per 1,000 inhabitants. 1890 1158 9.4 1891 862 7.0 1892 1478 12.0 1893 1987 16.2 1894 1104 9.0 1895 1157 9.4 1896 1473 12.1 1897 1331 10.9 1898 960 7.8 1899 1116 9.2 1900 989 8.1 1901 1146 9.8. The cases of infectious disease certified in the Metropolis during 1901 numbered 40,444,* and the attack-rate was 8.8 per 1,000 inhabitants. Subjoined is a list of the infectious diseases which are required to be notified to the medical officer of health, together with the numbers of cases certified in Shoreditch during the four quarters of the year, and the numbers and percentages of such cases which were removed to hospital for treatment:— Disease First Quarter. Second Quarter. Third Quarter. Fourth Quarter. Total. Deaths.

The increased number of cases of scarlet fever was the result of a localized outbreak which occurred during the second quarter of the year and which will be referred to later on in this report. The deaths from notifiable infectious disease numbered 72 as compared with 99 in 1900, 121 in 1899, 96 in 1898, 136 in 1897, 135 in 1896, and 117 in 1895. Diphtheria shews the most marked decrease in the number of deaths amongst the notifiable infectious diseases, there being only 28 deaths due to this cause as compared with 54 last year. The cases of enteric fever and erysipelas shew decreases and those of scarlet fever a slight increase as compared with the figures for 1900. Deaths from infectious diseases which are notifiable were at the rate of 0'6 per 1,000 inhabitants as compared with 0.8 for last year. Deaths from the principal zymotic diseases which are not required to be notified were at the rate of 2.4 as compared with 2.4 per 1,000 for 1900 METROPOLITAN ASYLUMS BOAED. With one or two exceptions, the whole of the cases which were removed to hospital for treatment, were removed to the various hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. The infectious diseases which are receivable into the hospitals of the Board are small-pox, scarlet fever, diphtheria, and enteric fever. Including 7 cases certified as continued fever, the number of cases of these diseases certified was 997, and the number removed to hospital was 861 or 86.3 per cent. The percentages for previous years were as follows:—84.7 per cent. in 1900, 82.4 in 1899, 81.4 in 1898, 71.4 in 1897, 65 in 1896, 57 in 1895, and 61 in 1894. From these figures it is apparent that the popularity of the treatment and isolation afforded by the hospitals of Board is still increasing in Shoreditch. Nine instances of recurrence of infectious disease in houses shortly after patients who had been treated in the fever hospitals of the Beard returned home, came under my notice during the year. In 5 instances the disease was scarlet fever, and the remaining 4 diphtheria. In 6 instances, 3 of scarlet fever and 3 of diphtheria, the indications were that the recurrences of the disease in the houses were the result of infection conveyed in some way by the patients recently returned from the fever hospitals. The origin of 'return' cases in the Metropolis is at the present time the subject of investigation by the Metropolitan Asylums Board. SMALL-POX. During the first 6 months of the year 1901 small-pox in London was limited to but a few cases, some 5 or 6 occurring during the months of January and February, and then the Metropolis was free from the disease until the end of May. Cases then occurred from time to time until the end of August, when they began to be notified in numbers in the Boroughs of St. Pancras and Marylebone, The disease gradually spread all over 11 the Metropolis, so that by the end of the year there was not a single Borough in Londo in which, more or less, cases of small-pox had not occurred. The Sanitary districts which suffered most heavily were the Boroughs of St Pancras, Holborn, Stepney and Bermondsey. Altogether during the year some 1,700 cases of small-pox were certified in London, and some 229 persons died from it. Prior to the present outbreak the last case of small-pox in Shoreditch was in January, 1900. From that time until September 12th, 1901, the Borough was free from the disease. The case which occurred on September 12th, was that of a girl residing in Fanshaw Street. She was certifed and removed to hospital. As to how she contracted the disease is unknown. She worked in Fleet Steet, and without doubt was infected outside the Borough. All the necessary precautions were taken for preventing the spread of infection. No further cases occurred in the house and so far as could be traced no one else was infected by this patient. During the rest of September, October, and November, isolated cases occurred. In two instances the patients were men from Holborn. They contracted the disease in Fulwood's Rents, Holborn, where there was a good deal of infection at the time, and they came to the Holborn Workhouse in Shepherdess Walk with the eruption out on them. They were at once removed to hospital, and the necessary precautions were taken. So far as is known, no further cases occurred as the result of these two cases in Shoreditch. During the month of December, cases of small-pox became more numerous in the Borough, but no especial difficulty was experienced in dealing with them. The distribution of the cases, and the deaths amongst males and females in the four Registration Sub-Districts of the Borough during 1901, is shown in the subjoined table: Sub-District. SMALL-POX. Certificates. Fatal Cases. Male. Female. Total. Male. Female. Total. Shoreditch South ... ... ... ... ... ... Hoxton New Town 4 ... 4 ... ... ... Hoxton Old Town 7 4 11 2 1 3 Haggerston 3 5 8 1 1 2 Total for the whole Borough 14 9 23 3 2 5 Excluding two cases which were subsequently found not to be small-pox, and the two cases from Fulwood's Bents, Holborn, the inhabitants of Shoreditch suffered from small-pox at the rate of 0.16 per 1,000 inhabitants, the attack rate being 0.07 in Hoxton New Town, 0.41 in Hoxton Old Town, and 0.11 in Haggerston. The deathrates from small-pox were 0.04 for the whole Borough, 0.11 in Hoxton Old Town, and 0.04 in Haggerston. 12 The particulars relating to the 23 cases of illness certified to be emall-pox in Shoreditch during 1901, are as set forth in the following table:— No. of Case.

On the tenth day after vaccination an eruption closely resembling that of small-pox in many of its characters made its appearance and it was deemed advisable that the child should be isolated. It was removed to South Wharf and kept under observation for fourteen days during which time the eruption disappeared and the child made a good recovery. The eruption was regarded as connected with the vaccination and there was a suggestion that the case may possibly have been one of generalized vaccinia. Excluding the Holborn Workhouse, twelve houses in Shoreditch were invaded by 13 small-pox, Six were in a satisfactory sanitary condition, three were in a fair sanitary condition and three were unsatisfactory, the premises being generally dirty and in one instance overcrowded, Secondary cases occurred in three of the houses. In two instances these were due to infection from the primary eases before they were removed to hospital. In the third instance the second case in the house resulted from a visit to the small-pox ships. A young man and two other persons friends of the patient who was dangerously ill with small-pox, went to see her. The young man refused to allow himself to be vaccinated and in a fortnight's time he was taken to the hospital ships himself with small-pox. The other persons who had recently been re-vaccinated remained well. With respect to the cases at No. 15 Norris Street, they were all members of the same family consisting of the parents and four children. The child which escaped was about 3 years old and had been vaccinated in infancy. She had been observed in the same bed with two of the other children who bad the eruption of small-pox out on them at the time. The measures taken for disinfection after cases of small-pox are briefly as follows:—The room or rooms which have been exposed to infection are stripped of all textile articles which, together with the infected clothing of the inmates, are removed by the Councils officers for disinfection at the disinfecting station, where they are subjected to the action of steam under pressure. The room or rooms are then sealed up and fumigated with sulphur dioxide, a gas produced by burning sulphur. The period of fumigation varies according as circumstances may require. After fumigation the rooms are thoroughly aired and the floors and woodwork generally, including that of the adjacent landings and staircases, are washed with soap and water mixed with carbolic disinfectant. In certain cases in which it appears necessary the walls are stripped of paper, after being damped with a solution of carbolic acid by the Council's officers. Re-papering is not allowed to be done until such time has elapsed that workmen may enter the dwelling with safety. When necessary the inmates of the infected dwellings are accommodated at the Council's Shelter in Reeves Place whilst their dwellings are undergoing disinfection. Whilst there, their clothing is disinfected and they are provided with baths. In all cases of small-pox the addresses of the infected houses are sent to the Vaccination Officer and the inmates of the infected dwelling are recommended to be vaccinated or re-vaccinated as the case may be. In many instances the advice so given is taken and acted upon. With respect to the subject of VACCINATION and the incidence of small-pox, the cases in Shoreditch during 1901 are obviously too few in number for any reliable conclusion to be drawn from them. Attention may, however, be directed to the Report of the Statistical Committee of the 14 Metropolitan Asylums Board, dated January, 1902, the importance of which cannot be overlooked. It deals with 1,017 cases completed—that is cases terminating fatally or recovering—during the year 1901. In this Eeport it is stated as follows:— "The cases have been divided into three classes, namely :—1. "Vaccinated," i.e. cases having visible cicatrices; 2. "Doubtful" which includes (a) cases stated to have been vaccinated but bearing no visible evidence thereof; and (b) cases in which no statement was made but in which the eruption prevented any reliable observation as to the cicatrices; and 3 "Unvaccinated" i.e. cases admittedly unvaccinated or bearing no marks of the operation and as to which no statement was made." "The gross mortality is given as 24.29 per cent. It must, however, be borne in mind that in arriving at this figure many cases of recent admissions have been included because they have been completed by death; whereas the contemporary cases which will nearly all ultimately recover, cannot be included until completed by discharge. The result being that the rate of mortality above given is undoubtedly higher than it will be when all the cases have been completed and the final rate ascertained." "The total mortality rate per cent. of vaccinated cases was 14.21; of doubtful cases 65.08, and of unvaccinated cases 50.52." "It is useful to consider the statistics as grouped under age periods. Under ten there were only 12 vaccinated cases and no deaths; 6 doubtful cases all of whom died, and 95 vaccinated cases of whom 52 died, a percentage of 64.74." "Under 20 there were 161 vaccinated cases of whom 3 died—a percentage of 1.86, 12 doubtful cases of whom 7 died—a percentage of 58.33, and 161 unvaccinated cases of whom 79 died—a percentage of 49.07." "There appears to be a distinct diminution in the protective power afforded by primary vaccination after the age of 20 years. The death-rate rising from 9.85 in vaccinated cases between 20 and 25 to 28.95 in cases between 35 and 40." As shewing the value of re-vaccination the report contrasts the incidence of small-pox on public officers and other persons who, whilst in the performance of their duties were brought in coutact with the disease, with the experience of the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board at their hospitals and in their ambulance service, in both of which re-vaccination is performed on officers entering their service. No fewer than 21 persons employed in disinfecting work by the various local authorities contracted the disease during the year. Not one of these had been re-vaccinated. On the other hand to quote from the report:— "Of 2,198 persons employed at the small-pox hospitals, between 1881 and 19 0 inclusive, in which period 17,900 small-pox cases were received into the hospitals, only 17 persons contracted small-pox, of whom 13 were not re-vaccinated until after they had joined the Ship, and 4 were workmen who escaped medical observation." "During the past year a very large number of new staff have joined the Ships and the Gore Farm Hospital (the exact number cannot be given at present) but not one case of smallpox has occurred. Not one of the Staff of the Hospital Ships has ever died of small-pox and not one has even suffered from the disease for the past 8 years." 15 ''From the year 1881 to the end of 1901 there have been employed in the Ambulance Service of the Board 1,282 persons. Pour of those persons contracted small-pox, of whom one escaped vaccination when appointed; he died; one was unsuccessfully re-vaccinated on joining the Service and the operation was not repeated; she died; the 2 others had been re-vaccinated and recovered." I co not think that it can be reasonably questioned that the foregoing paragraphs from the report of the Statistical Committee who must have gone most carefully into the facts and figures brought under their notice, constitute a most powerful argument in favour of the protective influence of vaccination and re-vaccination in small-pox. Since 1892 there has been a marked falling off in the numbers of children vaccinated in Shoreditch. In my report for last year the percentage of children born not finally accounted for with regard to vaccination are given for each year from 1872 to 1897. Shoreditch, at the present time, contains a large number of unvaccinated children. Taking the figures for the years 1892 to 1897 inclusive, of some 25-743 children born during that period in Shoreditch, nearly 10,000 were not accounted for with respect to vaccination during the first year of life, and in all probability the great majority of them still remain unvaccinated. SCARLET FEVER (SCARLATINA). The cases of scarlet fever certified during 1901, numbered 557. Seven of the cases were subsequently found not to be suffering from scarlatina at the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. The cases of scarlet fever which have been yearly certified since 1889, when notification became compulsary, are as set out below Year. Cases. Year. Cases. Year. Cases. 1890 639 1894 487 1898 426 1891 369 1895 592 1899 362 1892 834 1896 697 1900 330 1893 1,007 1897 628 1901 557 The increase in the number of cases certified as compared with the numbers for the previous three years which is observable in the above table, is the result of a sudden outbreak due to infected milk, which occurred at the end of April and the beginning of May. This outbreak has already been reported on in a special report. It will be sufficient here to briefly refer to the main facts. The area of Shoreditch chiefly affected was that lying along the eastern border of the Borough, adjoining Bethnal Green, the contiguous portion of which Borough was also affected. 16 The suddenness of the outbreak may be judged of by a glance at the subjoined table containing the numbers of eases certified each week from the beginning of the year:— No. of oases. No. of Cases Week ending- Week ending— No. of Cases January 5 4 March 16 2 Week ending— 12 ... ,, 23 3 May 25 21 19 3 „ 30 ...

Suspicion was aroused that some common cause was connected with the occurrence of these cases. Enquiry into the circumstances connected with the cases, made during the afternoon of the same day, elicited the fact that six of the seven patients lived in houses supplied with milk by a vendor who carried on business in a shop in the Hackney Road, on the Bethnal Green side. The other patient lived in a house where the milk was received from a vendor in the Kingsland Eoad. Both these vendors received the milk they sold from the same wholesale dealer. Enquiry was made of the Public Health Department of Bethnal Green, and it was ascertained that there had been that day an unusual number of cases of scarlet fever in that Borough, and that the houses invaded were supplied with milk by the vendor in the Hackney Eoad. Steps were then taken to Stop the sale of milk locally, and the facts connected with the outbreak were communicated to the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council, as it appeared probable that in consequence of the stoppage of its sale in Shoreditch, the infected milk might be diverted elsewhere into other sanitary districts in the Metropolis. This actually was the case, but fortunately only to a comparatively small extent. The steps taken by the Medical Officer of the London County Council are briefly referred to in a report of the Public Health Committee of the County Council dated May 9th. The circumstances of the wholesale vendor's business were investigated with results which pointed to the infected milk coming from one of some half-a-dozen farms situate in Derbyshire, Bucks and Staffordshire. The Medical Officers of the districts in which the farms were situate having been communicated with, a letter was received on the morning of May 4th, by the Council's Medical Officer, giving information that on one of the farms situated in Staffordshire, the milk from which had been chiefly suspected, some cases of throat illness suggestive of scarlet fever had occurred. Enquiries made by Dr. Hamer at the farm the same day, resulted in the provisional diagnosis of scarlet fever being made, and this diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by the desquamation of one of the patients. The milk from this farm was stopped on May 4th, and, with the exception of a small quantity, which was, howe er, not distributed in Shoreditch so far as is known, none of the infected milk was supplied after May 3rd. The stoppage of the milk from this farm was followed at once, 17 allowing for the period of incubation, by a marked drop in the number of cases of scarlet fever daily occurring, and there is little doubt that when it was stopped it was still in a highly infectious condition, and thus many cases which might have occurred were prevented. The number of cases which occurred in Shoreditch during the period the infectious milk was being distributed was 170, and of those 129 were amongst persons who had been supplied with the milk It is probable also, although no evidence was obtained as to the fact, that in several other cases the milk supplied was from the same infected source. It was noticed during the period of the scarlatina outbreak that the number of cases certified as diphtheria was markedly increased. From inquiries made it was found that in half of these cases the milk supplied was from the same infected source, and there are reasons for believing that a large percentage of these cases were really cases of scarlet fever, and that there was no real increase in the amount of diphtheria prevalent during this period It is hardly necessary to state that cases secondary to the original milk infected cases swelled the number of cases of scarlatina in Shoreditch for several weeks after the infected milk had been stopped. Had it not been for this milk outbreak, cases of scarlatina in Shoreditch would in all probability have been much below the average of previous years. During the time the infected milk was operative it was observed that the proportion of attacks amongst adults was larger than is usual with the ordinary run of scarlet fever cases, a fact in all probability to be accounted for by the manner in which the infection was distributed. Judging from the fatality of the cases, there is no reason for believing that the type of the disease was severer than usual. Nearly the whole of the cases occurring during the outbreak were removed to hospital for treatment. The disinfection of the premises infected was carried out with as little loss of time as possible after the removal of the cases. Efforts were made in all cases to deal with infected premises the same day as they were notified as ready for disinfection. During the early days of the outbreak when the work of disinfection was extremely pressing, assistance was rendered by the disinfecting officers of the Borough of Finsbury. Afterwards by dint of employing extra assistance and working from 6 a.m. to 1 or 2 o'clock the following morning each day's work was satisfactorily carried out. In a few cases only had disinfection to stand over until the next day. The outbreak involved a very large additional amount of work not only with respect to disinfection but in regard to the various inquiries which had to be made in each case, and for about a fortnight the ordinary course of the sanitary work was considerably retarded more especially in the sanitary districts of inspectors Firth, Jordan and Quelch, which were chiefly affected. The facts connected with this outbreak emphasize the need that exists for legislation making it a statutory obligation upon all milk vendors, whether wholesale or retail, to be in a position to give forthwith when required to do so by a medical officer of health reliable information both as to the farm or farms from which any particular day's supply of milk has been received and the customers to whom it has been delivered. 18 Had such information in connection with this outbreak been obtainable forthwith on application to the milk vendors I believe valuable time would have been saved in stopping the infected milk at its source, viz., the farm from which it was sent to London. The distribution of the cases certified and the deaths amongst males and females during the year 1901 in the Borough and its four Registration Districts are as shewn in the subjoined table. Sub-District. SCARLET FEVER. Notifications. Fatal Cases. Male. Female. Total. Male. Female. Total.

The rate was highest in Haggerston and lowest in Hoxton New Town. The number of persons attacked by scarlet fever in Shoreditch was at the rate of 4.7 per 1,000 inhabitants as compared with 2.7 per 1,000 in 1900. The mortality was at the rate of 3.5 per cent. of the cases as compared with 5.4 in 1900, 4.1 in 1889, 4.7 in 1898, 4.9 in 1897, and 5.4 in 1896. Amongst children under five years of age there were 205 cases. Of these 14 or 6.8 per cent. terminated fatally as compared with 12 per cent. in 1900, 9.l per cent, in 1899, 7.7 per cent. in 1898, 11 per cent. in 1897, and 12 per cent. in 1896. Amongst those over five years 6 died, the mortality being 1.7 per cent. as compared with 1.5 per cent. in 1900, 1.3 in 1899, 2.5 in 1898, and 1 per cent. in 1897 The number of cases of scarlet fever certified in London during 1901 was 18,387, the attack being at the rate of 4.4 per 1,000 population as compared with 3.0 in 1900, 3.9 in 1899, and 3.7 in 1898. The deaths numbered 584 as compared with 361 in 1900 and 398 in 1899, the death-rate being 0.13 per 1,000 as compared with 0.08 in 1900, 0.09 in 1899 and 0.13 in 1898. *During portions of these years, owing to lack of accommodation at the fever hospitals, many cases had to be treated at home which would otherwise have been removed to hospital. 19 DIPHTHERIA (INCLUDING MEMBRANOUS GROUP). *There were 316 oases of the above disorder certified during the year, including 23 n which the patients were subsequently found not to be suffering from diphtheria, and the deaths from the disease numbered 28, being fewer than in any year since 1390. The death rate due to diphtheria was 0.23 per 1,000 as compared with 0.45 in 1900, and 0.52 in 1899 (see appendix Table VI). The numbers of cases and deaths since 1890 are set out below: Year. Oases. Deaths. Year. Cases. Deaths. 1891 237 65 1897 361 80 1892 213 50 1898 259 45 1893 513 149 1899 369 63 1894 303 76 1900 353 54 1895 244 59 1901 316 28 1896 356 75 As shown by the percentage of the cases terminating fatally, diphtheria during 1901 was of a much less severe type in Shoreditch than in previous years since 1890. the case mortality being only 8.8 per cent. of the cases certified as compared with 15.3 in 1900, 17.0 in 1899, 17.3 in 1898, 22.1 in 1897, 21.0 in 1896, 24.1 in 1895, 24.0 in 1894, and 29.0 in 1893. Of the cases certified, the patients being under the age of 5 years, 15.4 per cent. terminated fatally as compared with 22.7 per cent. in 1900, 34.2 in 1899, 29.5 in 1898, 36.0 in 1897, 318 in 1896, 47.5 in 1895, 43.0 in 1894 and 61.0 in 1893. Of the cases certified amongst persons aged 5 years and upwards 4.4 per cent, ended fatally as compared with 71 in 1900, 5.4 in 1899, 6.5 in 1898, 9.9 in 1897 12.8 in 1896, 7.0 in 1895, 11.5 in 1894 and 11.4 in 1893. The whole of the deaths from diphtheria were of children under 15 years of age and in two instances only were the children over 10 years of age. Amongst adults diphtheria is frequently a mild complaint and often times escapes recognition, a fact which is highly favourable to the spread of infection. The most important factors in the production of the decline in the mortality from diphtheria which is observable from the above figures are, firstly, the natural decrease in the severity of the disease itself, and secondly, the use of anti-toxin in the treatment of the disease. Diphtheria was more prevalent in Shoreditch during the third quarter of the year. 20 The numbers of cases and the deaths amongst males and females in the Borough and its four Registration Sub-Districts are as follows: Sub-District. DIPHTHERIA (Including Membranous Croup.) Cases Certified. Fatal Cases. Male. Female. Total. Male. Female Total. Shoreditch South 20 24 44 - 3 3 Hoxton New Town 26 31 57 5 5 10 Hoxton Old Town 36 30 66 3 3 6 Haggerston 68 81 149 2 7 9 Total for the whole Borough 150 166 316 10 18 28 The cases certified were at the rate of 2.6 per 1,000 inhabitants. Of the cases certified 261, or nearly 83 per cent., were removed to hospital for treatment as compared with 86 per cent. in 1900, 80 per cent. in 1899, 77.2 per cent. in 1898, 67 in 1897 and 55 per cent. in 1896. During the year, enquiries were made as to the circumstances connected with 245 of the cases of diphtheria certified, and the distribution of the cases amongst males and females at certain age periods was as follows:— Age Period. Males. Female. Total. Under 1 year 1 - 1 From 1 to 2 years 14 12 26 ,, 2 ,, 3 ,, 7 16 23 ,, 3 ,, 4 ,, 21 18 39 ,, 4 ,, 5 ,, 15 12 27 ,, 5 ,, 10 ,, 20 30 50 ,, 10 „ 13 „ 6 15 21 Over 13 years 13 40 58 Total 102 143 245 Of the above cases 94 were children going to school, and in 78 instances they had been attending school within one week of the onset of symptoms. In a few cases the patients appear to have been attending school whilst suffering from the disease before it was recognised to be diphtheria. In 113 other cases, although the patients themselves were not attending school, other children members of the same amilies as the patients, or dwelling in the same houses, were attending school at the time the patients were taken ill. In 138 of the cases, the houses in which the patients resided were found on inspection to be in a satisfactory sanitary condition and in the remaining 105 insanitary conditions of major or minor importance were discovered. In 27 instances there were histories of cases of throat illness not regarded as diphtheria in the houses in which the patients lived and in 24 instances there was evidence of infection from previous cases. 21 The cases of Dipththeria certified in the Metropolis during 1901 numbered 11,967, and the attack-rate was 2.4 per 1,000 inhabitants; the deaths numbered 1344 and the death-rate due to this disease was 0.29 per 1,000 inhabitants. ENTERIC FEVER OR TYPHOID FEVER. The cases certified as enteric or typhoid fever numbered 96, which is below the average for the previous eleven years. Eight of the cases on removal to hospital were subsequently found not to be suffering as certified. The numbers of cases yearly certified since 1889 are as set out below:— Year. 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 No. of cases 202 111 91 111 85 99 114 107 91 171 122 96 The cases during 1901, which were more numerous in the New Town Registration Sub-District, were at the rate of 0.81 per 1,000 inhabitants. Of the cases certified, 91 were amongst persons aged 5 years and upwards. In addition to the cases certified as enteric fever there were seven certified as continued fever. The deaths numbered 10, three of which occurred in hospitals situate without the Borough. The deathrate due to enteric fever was 0.08 per 1,000 as compared with 0.11 per 1,000 in 1900, 0.2 in 1899, 0.14 in 1898, 0.15 in 1897, 0.14 in 1896, and 0.17 in 1895. Deducting the eight cases which were not regarded as enteric fever at the fever hospitals, the attacks proved fatal in 11.3 per cent. of the cases, as compared with 12.7 in 1900, 16.1 in 1899, 18.6 in 1898, 17.7 in 1897, 15.7 in 1896, 21.2 in 1895, 14.1 in 1894, and 15.8 in 1893. From these figures it will be seen that the mortality from enteric fever in Shoreditch during 1901, was much below the average of recent years. The distribution of the cases and deaths amongst males and females in the four Registration Sub-Districts during 1901, is as shown in the subjoined table:— Sub-District. TYPHOID FEVER. Notifications Fatal Cases. Male. Female. Total. Male. Female. Total. Shoreditch South 7 4 11 1 1 2 Hoxton New Town 19 17 36 1 1 2 Hoxton Old Town 14 12 26 1 2 3 Haggerston 14 9 23 2 1 3 Total for the whole Borough 54 42 96 5 5 10 Of the cases certified just over 83 per cent. were removed to hospital for treatment. 22 The cases certified as enteric fever in London during 1901 numbered 3,193, as compared with 4,309 in 1900, and 4,460 in 1899, the attack-rate being 0.70 as compared with 0.93 in 1900, and 0.97 in 1899. The death-rate was 0.12 per 1,000 as compared with 0.17 in 1900. ERYSIPELAS. The cases certified as erysipelas numbered 142, being fewer than in any year since 1891, as the subjoined table shews:— Year. 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 Number of cases certified 243 315 195 201 295 231 175 200 170 142 The deaths from erysipelas numbered 6, as compared with 10 in 1900, 16 in 1899, 11 in 1898, 5 in 1897, 3 in 1896, 5 in 1895, 5 in 1894, and 15 in 1893. The death-rate was 0.05 per 1,000 inhabitants, as compared with 0.08 in 1900, 0.13 in 1899, 0.09 in 1898, 0.04 in 1897, and 0.02 in 1896. The mortality was at the rate of 4.2 per cent. of the cases certified, as compared with 5.8 per cent. in 1900, 8 per cent. in 1899, 6.2 in 1898, 2.1 in 1897, 1.0 in 1896, 2.4 in 1895, 2.5 in 1894, 4.7 in 1893, and 4.5 in 1892. The distribution of the eases and the deaths amongst males and females in the Borough and its four Registration Sub-Districts are as set out below:— Sub-District. ERYSIPELAS. Cases Certified. Fatal Cases. Male. Female. Total. Male. Female. Total. Shoreditch South 8 11 19 - 1 1 Hoxton New Town 11 16 27 1 2 3 Hoxton Old Town 17 18 35 1 — 1 Haggerston 20 41 61 — 1 1 Total for the whole Borough 56 86 142 2 4 6 Blood-poisoning (pyaemia and septicaemia) resulted in 6 deaths, infective endocarditis in 6 deaths, and other allied diseases in three deaths. PUERPERAL FEVER. This disorder, which is grouped with erysipelas, blood-poisoning and other allied diseases, caused two deaths, the death-rate being 0.5 per 1,000 births as compared with 0.7 for 1900. Seven cases were certified, the attack-rate per 1,000 births being 1.7 as compared with 2.5 for last year. 23 DIARRHŒA. Diarrhœa was prevalent in Shoreditch during the months of July, August and September, the deaths being most numerous during the latter half of July and the first week of August. It caused 8 deaths in June, 43 in July, 49 in August, 32 in September and 9 in October. The total number of deaths from diarrhoea was 153, and there were besides 28 deaths attributed to enteritis or gastro-enteritis. Of the 153 deaths due to diarrhœa 127 were of infants under one year, 18 of children aged between one and 5 years, and the remainder were of persons over 20 years of age. The diarrhœa death-rate was 1.30 per 1,000 inhabitants as compared with 1.40 in 1900, 1.75 in 1899, 1.79 in 1898, and 1.74 in 1897. The rate was highest in Hoxton New Town, and lowest in Shoreditch South The deaths from diarrhœa in the Metropolis numbered 3,927, of which 2,606 occurred during the months of August and September. The death-rate due to diarrhœa in London was 0.85 as compared with 0.78 in 1900. In the subjoined table is contained a comparison of the mortalities from diarrhœa in Shoreditch and London of infants under one year per 1,000 births during the years 1895 to 1901 inclusive. Year. 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 Shoreditch 30.5 28.7 38.2 38.9 39.7 35.7 31.5 London 20.7 18.9 24.2 26.1 25.0 21.8 — From the above it is obvious that conditions exists in Shoreditch which favcr a high infant mortality from diarrhoea as compared with London as a whole. The chief of these conditions are probably the fact that Shoreditch is a very thickly populated district and that it contains a comparatively large proportion people whose livelihood is very precarious. Such conditions are very apt to lead to want of that due attention to general cleanliness which is so essential to a healthy existence. Food is often times prepared and eaten under insanitary conditions and the proper feeding of infants is not attended to as it ought to be. Inasmuch as the microbes which set up diarrhœa are in all probability mainly, if not entirely introduced into the stomach and intestines with food and drink, it is not difficult to understand that want of proper attention to cleanliness is a very potent factor in favoring the prevalence of diarrhœa in a community. MEASLES. The above disease was the cause of 75 deaths, 46 of males and 29 of females, all of children under ten years of age, of whom 9 belonged to Shoreditch South, 18 to Hoxton New Town, 14 to Hoxton Old Town, and 34 to Haggerston.. The death late due to measles was 0.64 per 1000 inhabitants, as compared with 0.63 in 1900, 0.69 in 1899, 0.83 in 1898, 0.91 in 1897, 1.10 in 1896, 0.84 in 1895, 0.52 in 1894, 1.04 in 1893 24 and 0.82 in 1892. The deaths from measles in the Metropolis during 1901 numbered 1960—the death-rate being 0.43 per 1000 inhabitants. Deaths from measles in Shoreditch were most numerous during the months of June, July, August, September, and December. WHOOPING COUGH. The above disorder occasioned 58 deaths, 27 of males and 31 of females. With one exception the whole of the deaths were of children under five years of age. The death-rate due to whooping cough was 0.49 per 1000 as compared with 0.35 in 1900, 0.36 in 1899, 0.80 in 1898, 0.49 in 1897, 0.94 in 1896, 0.67 in 1895, 0.70 in 1894 and 0.54 in 1893. The number of deaths from whooping cough in the Metropolis during 1901 was 1609 and the death-rate was 0.35 per 1000 inhabitants. Both in the case of measles and whooping cough death usually results through some complication such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Hence it is of the utmost importance in these disorders that proper attention and treatment should be given especially during the early stages of the disease. INFLUENZA. This disease, judging from the number of deaths, was not so prevalent in Shoreditch as in 1900. The deaths numbered 16 as compared with 52 in 1900, 35 in 1899, 22 in 1898, 16 in 1897, 7 in 1896, 57 in 1895, 15 in 1894 and 36 in 1893. The deaths in Shoreditch during 1901 mostly occurred during the first five months of the year. The deaths from influenza in London during 1901 numbered 664 as compared with 1950 in 1900 and 1817 in 1899. The deaths were most numerous during the months of March and April. TUBERCULOSIS. Tuberculosis (see appendix Table V., Nos. 20 to 34) was responsible for no less than 363 deaths as against 343 for last year. The majority of the deaths from tuberculosis were the result of consumption. Nearly one-seventh of the total mortality amongst the people of Shoreditch during 1901 resulted from this terrible disease, and the death-rate due to it was 3.0 per 1,000 inhabitants, varying from 36 in Shoreditch South to 2.5 in Hoxton New Town. The Borough Council disinfects, free of charge, after cases of taberculosis, but the preferred services of the Council's officers for this purpose have been hitherto in many instances rejected, ordinary steps as to cleansing being relied upon or no precautions at all being taken. Probably in most of these cases th fact as to the infectious nature of tuberculosis is not really grasped, and the people are inclined to regard the special precautions recommended as unnecessary. However, in some cases a very lively dread of the disease as being an infectious malady is met with, and in these cases the people are only too glad to avail themselves of the services of the Council's officers. During 1901 disinfection by the officers of the Borough Council was carried out in connection with 55 houses in which persons suffering from tuberculosis, chiefly consumption, had lived or died. 25 INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND SCHOOLS. In the following table are set forth the numbers of children, belonging to Shoreditch, who were suffering from various infectious diseases, or were members of households in which such diseases existed, concerning whom intimations of exclusion from school were received from the head teachers, in accordance with the requirements of the regulations of the London School Board:— SCHOOL.

Towards the end of May attention was directed to the number of children excluded from the Curtain Road School on account of measles. Enquiry was made into the circumstances connected with the prevalence of the disease amongst the scholars. It did not however appear necessary to take any further action. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. During the year Dr. Bullock, bacteriologist at the London Hospital, made 21 bacteriological examinations in connexion with suspected cases of infectious disease in Shoreditch. In one instance the case was suspected to be phthisis or consumption ; 26 the result of the examination was negative. In 11 instances the examinations were for diphtheria, the results in 9 being negative. In 9 the disease suspected was enteric fever, the results being positive as to the re-action in 4 and negatfve in the remainder. DISINFECTION. The premises disinfected during the year 1901 numbered 996. The number of articles removed to the Borough disinfecting station for disinfection amounted to 17,226, and included 1,064 beds, 880 palliases, 2,063 pillows, 810 bolsters, and 12,409 miscellaneous articles. Two beds and nine palliases were destroyed. The number of articles disinfected was largely in excess of that of any previous year. This was mainly the consequence of the milk-outbreak of scarlet fever, which has already been touched upon ; some 215 beds, 180 palliases, 397 pillows, 154 bolsters, and 2,388 textile articles of various descriptions were removed and disinfected during the outbreak, in addition to the usual amount of disinfection carried out in connexion with cases of infectious disease other than scarlet fever. The results of the steps taken as to disinfection, so far as could be judged, were satisfactory, and no instances came under my notice in which any damage was done. There was the usual distribution of disinfecting powder at the Town Hall, and some 26 gallons of carbolic disinfecting fluid were used for flushing house drains and urinals, and in connection with the public mortuary. THE SHELTER. The new Shelter provided under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, for members of families obliged to vacate their dwellings in certain cases to allow of effectual measures being taken as to disinfection, was opened for use on June 24th, by the Chairman of the Health Committee (Mr. E. Gates). The Shelter is situate in Reeves place, in an airy position, and conveniently accessible for all parts of the Borough. It consists of two stories and a basement. The basement, which is completely shut off from and has no communication with the rest of the building, is rented by the Llectric Lighting Department. Each of the two stories contains two suites of apartments, one of a sitting or living room and two bedrooms and the other of a living room and one bedroom. All the rooms are of a very convenient size, well lighted and ventilated. Each suite of apartments is provided with a bath room with hot and cold water service. The water supply and sanitary arrangements are in accordance with modern requirements. One suite of three rooms is reserved for the resident caretaker, and the remainder afford most excellent accommodation for three families. Everything in the shape of bedding, furniture, cooking utensils, knives and forks, coals and light is found for the temporary occupants. Food is provided in necessitous cases. The Shelter throughout is lighted by electricity. The length of time that temporary occupants pass at the Shelter varies from a few hours, which may be necessary for the purpose of disinfecting clothing, to a week or ten days in cases in which a complete disinfection and cleansing of a house throughout may be required. The average time that a family spends at the Shelter is from two to three days. 27 During the year under consideration the Shelter has been in use on thirteen occasions. The particulars relating thereto are as set out below. Date of Admission to Shelter. Duration of Stay. Number of Persons in Family. Address of dwelling disinfected. Disease.

THE PUBLIC MORTUARY. The bodies received into the mortuary numbered 420, including 3 of persons dying from infectious disease which were removed by order of the Sanitary Authority. The bodies received at the mortuary during the preceding five years were :—443 in 1900, 494 in 1899, 446 in 1898, 421 in 1897, and 404 in 1896. The number of post mortem examinations made in the post mortem room attached to the mortuary was 215, as compared with 229 in 1900, 232 in 1899, 164 in 1898, 159 in 1897, 128 in 1896, 109 in 1895, 60 in 1894, and 29 in 1893. The inquests held numbered 298, as compared with 324 in 1900, 354 in 1899, 339 in 1898, 331 in 1897, 301 in 1896, and 313 in 1895. WATER SUPPLY. The official figures for the rainfall in inches, measured at Oxford, were 22.16. The mean rainfall for 35 years is given at 25.29 inches, the deficit was therefore 3.13 inches with respect to this mean. No complaints were received as to shortness of supply during the year 1901. Communications were received from the Water Companies respecting the cutting off of water supplies at 146 premises, 36 on the East London Water Company's district and 110 on that of the New River Company. These intimations are sent in compliance with Section 49 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which requires a Water Company to - give notice in writing to the Sanitary Authority of the district in which the house is situate within 24 hours where the water is cut off by the Company from an inhabited dwelling-house. In many instances the intimations received during 1901 referred to premises which had been vacated. 28 SANITAEY "WORK. Notices as to insanitary conditions were served in respect to 2,121 premises. The chief sanitary inspector dealt with 300, inspector Lear with 426, inspector Quelch with 163, inspector Firth with 400, and inspector Jordan with 371. During the first half of the year inspector Lindon dealt with 244, and during he latter half of the year his successor, Mr. Langstone, dealt with 217 premises. In connection with the work carried out some 900 letters were written. In the subjoined table is contained a summary indicating the nature of the various works carried out for the abatement of nuisances and for the improvement of the dwellings of the people, which has been compiled from the abstracts of their work prepared by the inpectors:— Chief Insp.

Rats were a source of nuisance and annoyance on 124 premises ; the necessary steps were 29 taken to get rid of these troublesome rodents. On 138 premises leakages in the water pipes required attention. Urinals were constructed, cleansed or repaired, in connection with 31 premises. Fifty-four foul accumulations were removed in accordance with the directions of the sanitary officers. On 19 premises animals were found not properly stabled ; on 21 premises the stables required to be properly paved, and in 14 instances it was necessary for properly constructed dung receptacles to be provided. In all cases the necessary steps were taken to guard against nuisance. The bye-laws in force under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, for the prevention of keeping of animals on any premises in such place or manner as to be a nuisance, or injurious or dangerous to health, require that all dung, manure, and other offensive matters shall be deposited in a suitable receptacle ; that the building or premises shall be efficiently drained by a properly constructed drain, so that all urine and liquid filth or refuse may be effectually carried away ; and that any drinking water likely to be used by man shall be secured against possible pollution. It is also requisite, wherever it may be necessary, to prevent a nuisance arising through the keeping of any horse or other beast of draught or burden, or any cattle on any premises, that the floor of the stable in which such animal is kept shall be impervious to liquid matter. The floor must be paved with a hard and impervious pavement, so laid as to effectually carry off all liquid matters to the properly trapped inlet of a drain. The major portion of the sanitary work was carried out on the service of written intimations. Difficulties and delays in the execution of the works required were, however, frequently experienced, and in many instances it was necessary to report the cases to the Health Committee. By order of the Sanitary Authority, 213 notices under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, were served upon persons responsible for the abatement of nuisances. Of these 14 related to workshops. For non-compliance with statutory notices it was necessary to take Police Court proceedings as set out below:— LEGAL PROCEED1NGS. The premises in respect to which proceedings were taken, together with the result of the same, are contained in the subjoined list:— Premises. Result of Proceedings. Brunswick Street, No. 10 Brunswick Street, Nos. 85 and 87 Brunswick Street, No. 95 Grange Street, No. 74 Holborn Union Workhouse New Norfolk Street, No. 3½ Old Street, No. 318 Shap Street, Nos. 44 to 54 York Street, No. 31 Summons withdrawn, work done Order for work to be done, no costs. Order for work to be done, 6/- costs. Order for work to be done, costs. One summons dismissed, others withdrawn, no costs. Order to prevent recurrent nuisance, 6/- costs. Closing order. Order for work to be done, no costs. Order for work to be done £1 1s. costs. 30 The summons in respect to No. 10 Brunswick Street was for non-compliance with a s'atutory notice as to the provision of a proper dust receptacle. That in respect to Nos. 85 and 87 Brunswick Street was with regard to a defective drain. It was claimed on behalf of the defendant that the pipe in question was a sewer, and as such was repairable by the Borough Council. The facts were briefly as follows :— Certain additions had been made to an existing system of drainage, owing to the construction of a workshop and an additional water closet in the yard in rear of one of the houses. The sanction of the Borough Council had not been obtained, nor was there any order made in respect to these additions to the existing drain. The additional drains were, however, within the same curtilage as the existing system. The magistrate held that the drain in dispute was a drain and not a sewer, and made an order for the defendant to do the necessary work in connection with it. There was an appeal against the magistrate's decision, and the case was heard in the Court of King's Bench on March 25th and 26th of the current year, before the Lord Chief Justice and Justices Channel and Darling. The Court held that the magistrate was right in his decision under the circumstances. The additions of a drain from a water closet and a drain for taking water from the roof of a workshop to an existing system of combined drainage sanctioned by the Commissioner of Sewers in 1853, all the additional drains being within the curtilage of the premises ordered to be drained by combined operation, were not sufficient to convert the existing combined drain into a sewer. The appeal was accordingly dismissed with costs. The summons against the owner of No. 74 Grange Street was taken out in consequence of unnecessary delay in providing for the house a suitable water closet, furnished with a proper water supply. "With respect to No. 3½ New Norfolk Street, nuisance had repeatedly arisen through dung which had been allowed to accumulate; two parties were summoned but in one case the summons was withdrawn. In the case of No. 318 Old Street one summons was taken out in regard to a defective drain, and another on account of the general insanitary and dilapidated condition of the premises. The proceedings against the owner of Nos. 44-54 Shap Street were taken on account of a defective drain common to these houses. The case was adjourned by the magistrate for 21 days to enable the owner to get the necessary work done. Satisfactory progress was not, however, made, and on the case again coming before the magistrate, an order for the work to be completed in 14 days was obtained. With regard to the Holborn Workhouse the proceedings were taken owing to the conditions which were found existing in connection with certain trough waterclosets used by a large number of the inmates of the Workhouse. Early in the year the state of these troughs attracted the attention of the chief sanitary inspector, who happened at the time to be engaged in supervising the execution of some extensive improvements in connection with a portion of the drainage system of the institution. They were repeatedly found to be in such a state as to constitute a nuisance, and it was felt that so long as the troughs were allowed to remain there would always be the liability of a recurrent nuisance. After some correspondence with the Board of 31 Guardians for the Holborn Union upon the subject statutory notices under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, were served upon them requiring, with a view to preventing the recurrence of the nuisance, the removal of the existing troughs and the provision of proper water closets furnished with suitable separate pans and traps which could be efficiently flushed so as to obviate as far as possible risk of nuisance arising in connection with the use of the water closets'. The notices were not complied with and the case came before the magistrate. After hearing the evidence called on behalf of the Borough Council, he adjourned it sine die. The feeling of the magistrate appeared to be that there were so many technical points in connection with the construction of w.c.'s involved that it would be more satisfactory if the case could be brought before the London County Council. The efforts of the Borough Council to get the case before the London County Council failed however, and it was necessary to continue proceedings in the Police Court. Fresh summonses were taken out against the Guardians for non-compliance with statutory notices which were served under Section 37 of the Act, and also for breach of the bye-laws made by the Shoreditch Sanitary Authority under Section 39 (2) of the Public Health Act with respect to the keeping of water closets supplied with sufficient water for their effective action. Expert evidence was called on both sides, and the magistrate after viewing the trough at the Workhouse decided against the Sanitary Authority on the summonses for breaking the bye-laws, and thereupon further proceedings were abandoned, the other summons being withdrawn, and each side paying its own costs. HOUSES CLOSED. The following houses were closed during the year under consideration in consequence of the service of sanitary notices, either on account of being unfit for habitation or in order to enable the necessary works required to put them in a sanitary condition to be carried out in an effectual manner Britannia Street, No. 35 Bookham Street, No. 37 Dorchester Street, No. 36 Gifford Street, No. 37 Hearn Street, No. 7 Louisa Street, No. 13 Old Street, No. 318 Phillip Street, Nos. 65, 67, 69, 71 and 73 Socrates Place, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Sun Street, No. 48 Wilmer Gardens, Nos. 47, 49, 51 and 53 Whiston Street, Nos. 20 and 75 With respect to No. 35 Britannia Street this house was closed in consequence of a sanitary notice served by inspector Le ir in order to enable the necessary work to be carried out in a satisfactory manner. The drains were reconstructed, the house thoroughly cl ansed, and a back addition was rebuilt. No. 37 Bookham Street was closed under statutory notice to enable the necessary works to be effectually carried out ; the house was dilapidated, and the drains needed reconstruction No. 36 Dorchester Street was closed to enable works iu connection with the drains and general dilapidations to be carried out. 32 No. 7 Hearn Street is a large house and was let off in tenements. It was in a dilapidated and dirty condition and presented numerous sanitary defects in connection with the water closet accommodation, water supply, light, and ventilation. Upon the service of a sanitary notice by inspector Quelch it was deemed impossible by the owner to effectually deal with the premises whilst they were in occupation, and they were closed accordingly. The house was subsequently disinfected throughout by the Sanitary Authority, at the cost of the owner, as preparatory to putting it into a sanitary condition. The work required in connection with No. 13 Louisa Street was of such an extensive character as to render it impossible to carry out whilst the house was in occupation. It was therefore closed by the owner on receipt of a sanitary notice from inspector Quelch. Under his supervision the house was most thoroughly dealt with from top to bottom and put into a satisfactory sanitary condition. The five houses in Phillip S.rcet were dealt with under the supervision of the chief sanitary inspector. It was necessary for them to be closed as it was found impracticable-to effectually do what was required whilst they were in occupation. The twelve houses in Socrates Place each contain two rooms and a scullery. They were erected many years ago, and have from time to time received the attention of the sanitary staff. This year it was necessary to bring them under the notice of the Health Committee in consequence of their extremely delapidated and insanitary condition. Notices were served upon the owner under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which could only be effectually complied with after the dwellings had been vacated by the inhabitants. There was some hesitation on the part of the owner as to whether they should not be closed and demolished and the site cleared for the erection of workshops. After some correspondence, however, it was decided to do what was required by the notices and to put the houses into a good habitable condition. The work was commenced . bout the middle of the year and carried out under the supervision of the chief sanitary inspector. The houses were closed and dealt with as far as possible in sections so as to disturb the inhabitants as little as possible. All the houses were completely overhauled from top to bottom, being cleansed, repapered and painted throughout. The floors were repaired and all dilapidations made good, The roofs were seen to and the brickwork generally was reconstructed where necessary. The back additions were demolished and rebuilt on more sanitary lines, being enlarged and provided with more light and better ventilation. The water closets were reconstructed and a new system of drainage provided. The paving of Socrates Place was relaid in asphalt and properly drained by the Borough Council. The work extended over several months and was finally completed early in the current year and will stand as a very excellent piece of sanitary work efficiently carried out. The house No. 48, Sun Street, was closed in consequence of a sanitary notice served by inspector Jordan. The premises were in such a very dirty and dilapidated condition that the owner decided to close the house in order to get the work effectually done. With regard to the houses in Wrlmer Gardens, these were each occupied by several families and were in a very dirty and insanitary condition. They were closed towards 33 the end of the year and the work in connection with them is still in progress. In accordance with the suggestion of the chief sanitary inspector extensive alterations have been effected with a view of improving the condition and arrangement of the rooms so as to obtain better light and ventilation. The sanitary accommodation throughout is being attended to and a satisfactory piece of work is in progress. The houses in Whiston Street were closed in consequence of sanitary notices served by inspector Firth, and in each instance a satisfactory piece of work was carried out With respect to No. 20 the house was generally dilapidated and dirty, the walls and ceilings were dangerous and the front and side walls of the house were condemned by the district surveyor and had to be pulled down and reconstructed. SMOKE NUISANCE. With a view to the necessary steps being taken to prevent the emission of black smoke, the various shafts and chimneys, other than those of private dwelling-houses within the Borough, were kept under observation by inspector Quelch, who is charged with this important duty. Complaints were received from various sources, including 44 from the London County Council, referring to shafts and chimneys on 15 premises. In each instance the existence of the nuisance was brought to the notice of the person responsible, and the nuisance was abated for the time being. In several cases, however, there was a tendency to recurrence, and it was necessary to bring them under the notice of the Health Committee. In several cases it was necessary to serve statutory notices under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, upon the responsible parties, but no further proceedings were required. Complaints as to smoke nuisances were not so numerous as last year, and although several offending shafts still require to be kept under observation, I think, on the whole, there has been a decided improvement with respect to the emission of black smoke from the chimneys and shafts in the Borough. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. The intimations from the factory inspector respecting the establishment of workshops within the Borough received during the year numbered 38, principally relating to workshops used in the furnishing trade, cabinet making, upholstering, and tailoring. Of these, 24 were found on inspection to be in a satisfactory condition, and the remainder required more or less the attention of the Council's sanitary officers for the rectification of insanitary conditions. In addition to the above, 94 written intimations were received from the factory inspector relating to various insanitary conditions and infringements of the law relating to public health in connection with 134 workshops and workplaces. The conditions chiefly requiring attention, were: want of proper attention to cleansing, defective and insufficient w.c. accommodation, general delapidations, defective roofs, dampness, defective drains, and over-crowding. The premises 34 indicated were all visited and inspected by the officers of the Borough Council; the necessary steps were taken to deal with the insanitary conditions, and the factory inspector was duly informed of the same in accordance with the statutory requirements. In addition to those brought under the notice of the Sanitary Authority by the factory inspector, numbers of other workshops, factories, and workplaces received attention at the hands of the officers of the Council during the course of the year. The law relating to factories, workshops, and workplaces has been consolidated and amended by the which considerably alters and adds to the duties which have hitherto been carried out under the supervision of the Borough Council in relation to factories, workshops, and workplaces. The Act incorporates new provisions which provide as follows :—(a) In the case of workshops, every room must have sufficient ventilation ; a standard of ventilation may be prescribed by the Secretary of State for any class of workshops, and where prescribed, this standard must be maintained ; also where dust or gases are generated, if required by the factory inspector, fans must be provided, (b) A general power is given to the Borough Council to deal with bakehouses which on sanitary grounds are unfit for use as such ; there is a prohibition of the use of underground bakehouses, unless they were in use on August 17th, 1901 ; and after January 1st, 1904, the use of underground bakehouses will become unlawful unless the bakehouses are certified by the Borough Council as suitable places for baking in. An underground bakehouse is defined in the Act as being a bakehouse in which any room used for baking, or for any process incidental thereto, is so situate that the floor thereof is more than 3 feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street, or of the ground adjoining or nearest to the room. (c) With respect to home work, lists of outworkers are to be kept in certain trades ; home work may be prohibited in unwholesome dwellings, and in dwellings where there is infectious disease. (d) The Borough Council is required to keep a register of all workshops situate within the Borough. (e) The medical officer of health is required to report specifically on the administration of the Act, especially dealing with the provisions as to sanitation, bakehouses, and homework, and a copy of his report on the subject is to be sent to the Secretary of State.

The bakehouses situate at No. 2 Pitfield Street and 249 Old Street adjoin each other and belong to the same business. These are regarded as one bakehouse for inspection purposes. The bakehouse at No. 183 City Road is not used at present for baking, the baking for the shop attached thereto being carried out at No. 28, Shepherdess Walk. The bakehouse situate at No. 109 Bridport Place has been out of use since the middle of August. Of the 84 bakehouses in use, 72 were in a satisfactory condition when inspected, and the remainder were fairly so. Limewashing and general cleansing were necessary in eleven, and in five a few minor sanitary matters required attention. Fifty-three of the bakehouses in Shoreditch are underground within the meaning of the definition contained in Section 101 (3) of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901. The new provisions of this Act relating to bakehouses have already been referred to. SLAUGHTEEHOUSES. The Slaughterhouses on the register number 15 or one less than last year. They are situate at the addresses set out below:— Broadway, London Fields, No. 7 &23 New North Road, Nos. 64 and 179. Goldsmith Row, No. 134. Pitfield Street, No. 53. Hackney Road, Nos. 35 and 135. Shepherdess Walk, Nos. 60 and 92. Haggerston Road, Nos. 4 and 76. Weymouth Terrace, No. 59. Hoxton Street, No. 184. Whitmore Road, No.1 to 3 36 The condition in which the slaughterhouses were kept during the year was on the whole satisfactory, and in one or two instances only was it necessary to bring matters requiring attention to the notice of the proprietors. The animals slaughtered in the slaughterhouses of Shoreditch are almost entirely sheep. Very few oxen are killed during the course of the year. COWHOUSES, DAIRIES, AND MILKSHOPS. The registered cowhouses in Shoreditch number 10, the licenses of two having been allowed to lapse since last year. They are situate at the addresses set out below:— Bracklyn Street, No 22. Mintern Street, No. 7. Clift Street, No. la. Nile Street, No. 38. Dunstan Street, No. 33. Rufus Street, No. 3. Hoxton Street, No. 274. St. John's Road, No. 76. Moye Street, No. 47. Taplow Street, No. 31. The cowhouses were found to be kept in a satisfactory condition, in one or two instances only was there anything to complain of. The cows in the cowhouses in Shoreditch numbered 110, as compared with 114 in 1900, and 135 in 1899. Eor several years past there has been a gradual but steady decrease both in the number of cowhouses and in the number of cows kept in the Borough. The London Government Act, 1899, transferred the registration of dairymen and purveyors of milk from the London County Council to the Borough Council. The number of dairymen and purveyors of milk on the register for the year is 319. There have been several changes in respect to the names of the persons registered. The various dairies and shops at which milk is sold, have been kept under observation and visited at frequent intervals during the year by the sanitary inspectors. Fifteen of the shop ceased the sale of milk during the year. In a few instances the sale of milk was suspended owing to the occurrence of dangerous infectious disease on the premises, the sale being resumed after the necessary precautions as to disinfection had been taken. In the majority the milk was found to be sold under conditions which may be regarded as satisfactory, in 27 instances, however, warnings were necessary by reason of the milk utensils not being kept in as cleanly a condition as they ought to have been. In seven cases new measures for the milk were provided. Vendors using open receptacles for the milk are recommended to keep a piece of fine muslin over the receptacle, with a view to the exclusion of dust and flies. On 9 of the premises defective drains were found and rectified. In 9 instances the water closets required attention, in four accumulations of dung were removed, and in several instances the premises required cleansing. Altogether, 27 sanitary notices were served upon the responsible parties. 37 OFFENSIVE BUSINESSES. The two premises upon which offensive businesses are being carried on in Shoreditch, situate at No. 69 Haggerston Road and No. 110 Goldsmith Bow, respectively, have been subject to inspection during the course of the year. No complaints have been received in connection with either of them. In each case the business carried on is that of tripe boiling. Serious defects were ascertained to exist in connection with the drainage system on the premises of No. 69 Haggerston Boad, and it was necessary to carry out extensive works of reconstruction in connection with the drains, which were completed during the current year. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. The following houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family were registered under the bye-laws in force in the Borough relating to them:— Westmoreland Place, Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,10,11, 13, 16, 20, 22, 24, 33 and 39 ; Collingwood Street, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7; Underwood Street, Nos. 19, 20, 23, 28, 29, and 30. Altogether 28 houses were registered during the year and the total number which had been placed on the register is 184. CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACT. Applications for certificates as to the sanitary fitness of dwellings to enable exemption from inhabited house duty being obtained were received in respect to 62 tenements, twelve of which belonged to the Borough Council. They were duly inspected and found to be satisfactory and the necessary certificates were granted. COMMON LODGING HOUSES. Common lodging houses are registered and regulated by the London County Council. The situations of such houses in Shoreditch together with the numbers oi lodgers each is authorised to accommodate are as set out as below : — Situation. No. of Lodgers. Sex. Situation No. of Lodgers. Sex. Aubert Building 117 M Kingsland Road, No. 23 101 M Boot Street, No. 2 6 M ,, ,, ,, 227 109 M ,, ,, ,, 3 2 M Scrutton Street ,, 65 13 M ,, ,, ,, 6 56 M St. John's Road ,, 33 38 M Dunloe Street ,, 31 46 M ,, ,, ,, 35 39 M Dunstan Street ,, 2 37 M ,, ,, ,, 37 41 M Eagle Wharf Road ,, 53 41 M Wilmer Gardens 122 M 38 The registered common lodging houses afford accommodation for 768 men. During the course of the year visits of inspection were made by the sanitary inspectors and the general condition of these houses was found to be satisfactory sanitarily. In several slight defects in connection with the sanitary conveniences and yard paving were remedied. At No. 6 Boot Street the water closet and lavatory accommodation was unsatisfactory and a re-arrangement with some additional accommodation in the way of sanitary conveniences was carried out under the supervision of the chief inspector resulting in a great improvement being effected. This was the only extensive piece of sanitary work found necessary in connection with the registered common lodging houses in the Borough. STREET MARKETS AND POOD. Early in the year the question of the supervision of the market streets on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings came under the consideration of the Borough Council. Hitherto, it had been the practice for one inspector, with the assistance of one of the disinfecting officers to discharge this duty, the five district sanitary inspectors acting in rotation. It was felt that there was a good deal more work entailed in this duty than one inspector could adequately perform, and it was decided that as many of the inspectors as may be required, should be on duty in the street markets every Saturday night and Sunday morning. The usual daily supervision was exercised by the sanitary officers over the street markets and the food exposed for sale, and frequent inspections were made with a view to the detection of unsound food. Except in a comparatively few instances the quality of the various food stuffs exposed for sale was excellent. The following articles were destroyed during the year as unfit for the food of man:— mutton 14 legs, 153 pieces and 114 lbs., mutton and beef 31 lbs., rabbits 8 cwt., Ostend rabbits 1 box and 66 lbs., bacon 10 lbs., 6 fowls, 2 boxes and 30 lbs. of cods' roes, 4 barrels of herrings, 1 barrel of skate, 2 trunks of haddocks, 78 boxes and 112 lbs. of tomatoes, 9 baskets of carrots, 50 bananas, and 2 boxes of pears. In many instances the unsound articles were brought under the notice of the sanitary officers. In one instance a seizure of tomatoes was made, and an order was obtained from a magistrate for their destruction. It was not, however, deemed advisable to prosecute in this case. ICE-CREAM SHOPS. During the year special attention was given to the premises in Shoreditch upon which ice-cream is manufactured or sold. It has been pointed out by several competent observers that ice-cream is oftentimes made under conditions which render 39 it very liable to contamination, and more than one wide-spread outbreak of infectious disease have been recorded in which ice-cream has been the vehicle by which infection has been conveyed. During the summer months, deaths due to irritation of the stomach and bowels' attributed to the consumption of ice-cream are of not infrequent occurrence. Ice-cream in itself, taken in moderation is not harmful, it is the noxious matters by which it is readily contaminated, which cause mischief. This contamination can be prevented if only due care is exercised in its manufacture and storeage, and every effort should be made in the interest of the public health that the necessary precautions are observed. The London County Council are now seeking legislation on lines which have been considered and approved of by the Shoreditch Borough Council with a view to ensuring that manufacturers of ice-cream shall be under statutory obligation to take all adequate measures for the preservation of ice-cream from contamination and infection. Thirteen ice-cream shops were inspected by inspector Lear. Ten of these were found in a clean and satisfactory sanitary condition. In the remaining three, defects of major or minor importance were met with. In one instance the milk used in the icecream was found to have been scalded in a room used for sleeping purposes. Of seven premises visited by inspector Quelch four were found in an unsatisfactory condition. In two instances grave sanitary defects were found existing. Seven premises were inspected by inspector Firth ; in six of them sanitary defects were found, such as defective drains, defective yard paving, rain water pipes connected directly with the drains, dilapidations of floors, stairs, windows, and doors, and defective ventilation. Fifteen premises upon which ice cream was manufactured were inspected by inspector Jordan. Six were found in a satisfactory and cleanly condition; in the remaining nine sanitary defects of more or less gravity were discovered, such as defectively paved yards, untrapped sink waste pipes, defective water closets, dilapidations, dirty condition of premises, defective drains in two instances, and in one overcrowding of the premises. In four cases the conditions existing were found to be very unsatisfactory. Twelve premises were visited by inspector Lindon. Eight were found in a more or less unsatisfactory state, the principal defects being dilapidations, dirt, defective yard paving, defective water closets, and untrapped sink waste pipes. In one instance there was overcrowding. Altogether, of 54 premises inspected, 24 were found satisfactory, and kept in a cleanly condition, and 30 were unsatisfactory, requiring more or less attention to put them in a proper sanitary condition. In two or three instances it was necessary to report the facts of the ease to the Health Committee, and statutory notices under the Public Health Act were served, In the end all the defects discovered were remedied. 40 SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS. The reports of the Public Analyst, Dr Stephenson, copies of which are appended (p. 56) shew that during the year 1901, 269 samples were submitted to him for analysis, viz.: 211 by inspector Quelch, 28 by inspector Sear, 12 by inspector Forth, 12 by inspector Jordan, and 6 by inspector Langstone, the latter four inspectors having been appointed to take samples under the Food and Drugs Act, more especially with a view to additional work being done in this direction on Saturdays and Sundays. Of the 269 samples, 127 were of milk, 89 of butter, 12 of flour, 12 of ice-cream, 8 of coffee, 6 of jam, 6 of sweets, 6 of ale, and 3 of cheese. Of the samples of milk, 25 or nearly 20 per cent. were found to be adulterated or not of the proper quality, and proceedings were taken against the vendors in the Police Court. In addition, 15 samples of milk were found to contain from 2 to 6 per cent. of water beyond the amount normally present. In these cases, no proceedings were, on the advice of the analyst, taken. In 24 of the 25 cases the Police Court proceedings were successful, and fines were inflicted in amounts varying from £15 downwards. In the case which was not successful, the magistrate dismissed the summons on the ground that the percentage of water added was too small for him to convict on. The samples of butter shewed adulteration to the extent of 18 per cent., 17 of them being found to be adulterated, and in addition two samples contained more than 16 per cent. of water. Convictions were obtained in 15 of the 17 cases taken before the magistrate, the fine inflicted varying from £20 downwards. In one instance the summons was dismissed, the magistrate holding that the vendor was covered by Section 8 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, the purchase having been completed. It appeared that the assistant asked for butter, and an article which on analysis turned out to be margarine was handed to him in paper with the word " margarine " stamped upon it. The vendor at the request of the assistant subsequently put it into plain paper. In the other instance the case failed, as the magistrate considered that the margarine had been served by mistake for butter. The article was sold by a son of the defendant who happened to be in the shop at the time. He was not authorised to sell it nor was he accustomed to the business. In a third instance a summons was taken out but not proceeded with, as an error was discovered in the numbering of the division of the sample. Three of the eight samples of coffee taken were adulterated with chicory, and the vendors were convicted and fined. Altogether proceedings were taken in 45 instances, or with respect to nearly 17 per cent. of the samples taken. Including the 15 samples of milk containing water beyond the normal, and the two samples of butter containing water beyond the amount of 16 per cent. of the total number of samples taken, 23 per cent. were adulterated. The fines inflicted amounted to £132, and the costs to £28 10s. SANITARY STAFF. During the year the Borough Council lost the services of inspector Lindon, who left on June 22nd to take up a similar position under the Borough Council of Kensington. Mr. C. Langstone, one of the sanitary inspectors of the Borough of Southwark was appointed to fill his place, and began his duties in Shoreditch on 41 August 19th. For the period between the end of June when inspector Lindon left and August 19th, owing to the absence of inspector Quelch on account of illness, the department was short of two inspectors. This deficiency was met by inspectors Lear, Firth and Jordan, in accordance with the instructions of the Health Committee, commencing work daily two hours earlier in the morning and leaving off an hour later in the evening. This arrangement enabled them to a very large extent to cope with the work on the two districts which were for the time being without sanitary inspectors. Assistance in the work of these two districts was also given by the chief sanitary inspector. Inspector Quelch was absent altogether for four months. During the latter part of his absence the work on his district was attended to by the chief inspector and the inspectors of the adjoining districts. A similar arrangement for the temporary performance of the work on his district was made during the absence of inspector Jordan, who was away ill for just over three weeks in November. Consequent on the death of Mr. J. Barclay, who had been messenger and general assistant in the Health Department for a number of years, Mr. H. P. Abbott was appointed to fill his place at a salary of 25s. per week, and he commenced his duties early in August. In conclusion I have to express my satisfaction as to the manner in which the various officers of the Health Department have discharged their duties during the year dealt with in this Report, and my thanks are due to the chairman and members of the Health Committee for the assistance they have rendered me in connection with my work. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, LEWIS T. ERASER BRYETT, Medical Officer of Health. - APPENDIX TO THE REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OP HEALTH.
