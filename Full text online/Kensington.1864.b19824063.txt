KEN 91 NINTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH EXTRACT FROM THE VESTRY REPORT FOR MARCH, 1864 - MARCH, 1865 ) 16 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. TO THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF KENSINGTON. Sanitary Department, Vestry Hall, Kensington. June 1865. Gentlemen, I beg to draw your attention as briefly as possible to the condition of the health of the Inhabitants of your Parish as is shewn by the Mortality Returns, and to its Sanitary Condition, as shewn by the number of notices, summonses, &c., ordered to bo issued by your Sanitary Committee. The total number of deaths which has taken place during the twelve months ending December 31st, 1864, according to the returns gratuitously sent me weekly by the Registrar General, has been— Males. females.. total. Brompton Ward 252 237 489 Town Ward 647 713 1360 899 950 1849 This indicates an increase of Mortality in the Brompton District of 33 over last year, and in the Town an increase of 188, or a total increase of 221 for the whole Parish. The mortality it will thus be seen, is not, higher than usual, although it is next to impossible to attempt to ascertain a population which has nearly doubled itself during the past ten 3'e.irs. 161 deaths took place in the Consumption Hospital, situate in Brompton, nearly all of whom were Non-Parishioners; and would about equal the numbers of our own Inhabitants dying in other Hospitals of the Metropolis, not situate in Kensington. 120 paupers died in the Workhouse, viz., 55 males and 65 females. 17 During the same period the number of birlhs were- Males. females. total. Brompton 248 257 505 Town Ward 1028 961 1989 1276 1218 2494 Which gives a total gain to the parish of G15 in excc.33 of the fatality. The total number of deaths from diseases of the zymotic or infectious class has been, Brompton 49 ; Kensington 325, which is but slightly in exccss over 1863, whilst Small Pox has sunk from 49 to 5. This must be considered very satisfactory, as shewing that this disease, which threatened such progress last year, has entirely abated. With regard to Fever, the number is about equal with last year. It should be particularly noticed that in no instance should a typhus case be allowed to remain in the house where the disease originated; and especially that overcrowding should, as far as possible, be prevented. This latter is perhaps one of the greatest difficulties to be contended with in some parts of the parish; for if removed from one part they tend to overcrowd another.

The following is the list of nuisances reported to your Sanitary Committee, for which notices for removing or abating the same were ordered to be served under the "Nuisances Removal Act." 18 Proceedings under Nuisances Removal Act. From March 25th, 1864, to March 25th, 1865.

GILES LOVETT, Inspector. 19 In addition to the overcrowding in the poorer localities, is tlie defective supply of water for domestic use. In these places I believe no perfect remedy exists but a constant instead of an intermittent supply. The construction of public sewers has progressed during the past year, but many localities have still no drainage whatever. 98 bake-houses are now under supervision. 54 slaughter-houses, the (same number as last year) and 53 cow-sheds, were licensed by the Magistrates. The gas, as supplied by the Western Gas Company, has been from time to time tested, as to its illuminating power and chemical purity. The average illuminating power has been equal to 22 candles, (maximum 24-180, minimum 20-31), this shews an illuminating power in excess of that required by the Act. Chemically, it is almost or entirely free from sulphurrated hydrogen but contains at times an excess of ammonia. In other respects it is purer than the Act demands. Several special reports have been made to you occasionally, especially one relating to the candle melting establishment of the Messrs. Tucker which I beg to annex, and have the honor to remain, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, FRANCIS GODEICH, Medical Officer of Health. 20 Vestry Hall, Kensington, October ith, 18G4. Gentlemen, According to your Distractions, I beg to report upon tlie condition of the Candle Factory, opposite tlie Vestry Hall, Kensington High Street. The scction of the Act of Parliament, applying to nuisances arising from the melting of tallow, is the 27th of the Nuisances Removal Act, (page 558), which enacts that " If any Candle House, Melting House, &c., be at any time certified by a Medical Officer, to be a nuisance or injurious to the health of the Inhabitants of the neighbourhood, the local authority shall direct complaint to be made before any justice, &«., and if it shall appear to such justices that the trade carried on by the person complained against, is a nuisance, or causes any effluvia injurious to the health of the Inhabitants of the neighbourhood, and that such person shall not have used the best practicable means for abating such nuisance, or preventing, or counteracting such effluvia, the person so offending shall upon a summary conviction for such offence, forfeit and pay a sum of not more than £5, nor less than 40s.," &c. The next section enacts that if the part}- complained of objects to have the cause tried by such justices, the local authority shall abandon all proceedings before the justices, and shall take proceedings at law, or in equity, in Her Majesty's superior courts, for abating the nuisance complained of. It thus appears that the question at issue is, has Sir. Smith, the occupier or owner of this Candle and Melting House, used the best practicable means for abating or counteracting such effluvia? and I am bound to say that, after inspecting every establishment; both large and small, in the Metropolis, I am unable to point out any further scientific means which he could adopt. His premises have been under supervision ever since my appointment, and I have reported several times to your Vestry, the steps Mr. Smith has taken to reduce the nuisance. It is however a question which I think your Vestry should take into consideration, whether these premises should not be examined by some one experienced in operations of this kind, and a report handed to you on the subject. I remain, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, FRANCIS GODR1CH, Medical Officer of Health.
