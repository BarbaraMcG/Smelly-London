AREA. The boundary of the Pariah of St. Pancras was described in detail in last year's Annual Report for 1899. It is now desirable to place on permanent record for statistical purposes the boundary of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras, that came into existence in November, 1900. It is also necessary to record, with the alterations of the boundary, the properties that have passed to or from St. Pancras, from or to either of the adjoining Boroughs, and the Registration Sub-Districts of St. Pancras in which they were or are situated. These alterations will commence to be taken into account in 1901. LONDON GOVERNMENT ACT, 1899. Boundary of the Metropolitan Borough of Saint Pancras, 1900.

wall forming the western boundary of St. Dominic's Church, Priory, and Schools, and continuing in the same direction along the wall forming the western boundary of the land belonging to the St. Pancras Almshouses, and continuing in the same direction along the western boundary of the land belonging to the Orphan Working Schools to a point forming the north-eastern corner of the premises belonging to the "Load of Hay" public house, No. 94, Haverstock Hill, thence in a south-easterly direction along the back wall of property fronting on Havertock Hill down to the south-east corner of the Presbyterian Church, thence in a south-westerly direction along the end wall of the Presbyterian Church, and out to the centre of Haverstock Hill, thence down the centre of Haverstock Hill to a

direction, to and along the centre of Ormonde Terrace to Albert Road, thence passing along Albert Road eastward to St. Mark's Square, thence southward across the Regent's Canal on the centre line of the footbridge, and crossing the Outer Circle and passing along the centre of the Broad Walk through Regent's Park to the Outer Circle Road on the south side of Regent's Park, thence eastward along the Outer Circle Road to its intersection with Park Square East, thence southward along the centre of Park Square East to its intersection with Euston Road, thence eastward along the centre of Euston

In the Report of the Metropolitan Asylums Board for 1899 the population of St. Pancras was estimated at 244,548. In the medical papers in 1900 the population was estimated at 245,651. It is possible that these figures may have been inspired from the Registrar-General's office, as when the death-rates in the Quarterly Returns of the Registrar-General for 1900 are re-calculated into the number of deaths, they produce a population of 245,000. It will be safer to regard the population not as increasing but stationary at 240,764, the enumerated population of 1896. The figures of the 1896 Census have been taken as a basis, and the 2312 inmates of Extra-Parochial Institutions have been added to the Sub-Districts in proportion to the population as the deaths amongst these inmates are included in the Statistics of the Year.

I beg to inform you that this Authority has received an Order of the Local Government Board, dated 19th September, 1900, making Regulations with regard to Plague. In the District of every Sanitary Authority, the sections of the Public Health Acts in reference to the compulsory notification of dangerous infectious diseases are, by this Order of the Local Government Board, made applicable to Plague. The Order also requires that circular letters shall forthwith be sent to all legally qualified Medical Practitioners in the District, informing them of their duties under this Regulation.

I also beg to inform you that this Authority has passed the following Resolutions in reference to the prevention of Plague:— 1.—That, as heretofore, at the address of any person notified by a Port Medical Officer of Health as arriving from an infected or suspected port, inquiries be made daily for at least ten days as to whether the person remains in good health, and at the present address, and, if intending to leave, to what place and address it is the intention to go, and that any intended change of address be communicated to the Medical Officer of Health, and in addition that it be made known to travellers that giving a false name, or failing to notify a true destination, or otherwise infringing the regulations is punishable by a fine of one hundred pounds, and fifty pounds a day during continuance. 2.—That at the address of any person similarly notified by an inland Medical Officer of Health similar inquiries be made. 3.—That Medical Practitioners be informed that Plague is now a compulsorily notifiable dangerous infectious disease, by Order of the Local Government Board, dated 19th September, 1900. 4.—That Medical Practitioners in Saint Pancras be informed that the Metropolitan Asylums Board has provided hospital accommodation at the South-Eastern Hospital for persons duly certified to be suffering from Plague. 5.—That Medical Practitioners in Saint Pancras be informed that persons duly certified to be suffering from Plague will be conveyed free of charge by the Ambulances of the Metropolitan Asylums Board to the South-Eastern Hospital upon receipt of applications by telephone or telegraph, as in the case of the other dangerous infectious diseases admitted by the Board. 34 6.—That Medical Practitioners in Saint Pancras be informed that a list of London medical men who have had experience in the clinical diagnosis of Plague is kept in the Health Department, and that arrangements have been made for clinical diagnosis in oases of suspected Plague at the cost of the Sanitary Authority. 7.—That Medical Practitioners in Saint Pancras be informed that arrangements will be made for bacteriological diagnosis in cases of suspected Plague at the cost of the Sanitary Authority. 8.—That Medical Practitioners in Saint Pancras be informed that any sick person that may be suspected of suffering from symptoms of Plague should be kept under treatment in the suspected room, the suspected house and attendants upon the sick should be strictly isolated, and the apparently healthy inmates of the house should be treated as " contacts," and be removed to a Reception House, to be kept under observation for at least ten days. 9.—That Medical Practitioners in Saint Pancras be informed that the Family Shelter would be temporarily set apart as a Reception House for "contacts" until arrangement for further premises could be made. 10.—That all bedding, clothing, and other stuff articles suspected of being infected with Plague be burnt in the incinerator, and that the Owners be compensated. 11.—That the whole of any house suspected of being infected with Plague be thoroughly fumigated, stripped, cleansed, and otherwise disinfected to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health. Clinical Diagnosis.—Symptoms of Plague. The Medical Officer of the Local Government Board, by circular dated September, 1900, describes the symptoms of Plague as follows:— An ordinary attack of Plague usually begins some three to five days after exposure to infection. Such attack may develop gradually, but as commonly met with, there is sudden onset with much fever, as indicated by a high temperature, rapid pulse, headache, hot skiD, and thirst. The eyes are injected as if inflamed; the expression, at first anxious and frightened, becomes subsequently vacant and dull; the utterance is thick, and the gait unsteady as in one under the influence of drink. There is at times a distinct tendency to faint. The tongue is at first covered with a moist white fur, except at the edges, which are red, but later on it becomes dry, and of a mahogany colour. The most distinctive sign of Plague is the presence of swellings, or "buboes," as they are called, in the groin, armpit, or neck. These "buboes," which led to the disease being called "Bubonic Plague," and which have no relation to venereal complaints, appear as a rule about the second or third day of the disease. They are usually painful and tender on pressure, and in size they vary from that of an almond to that of an orange. Later on they may "gather" and burst like an ordinary abscess. There may, too, appear about the body purple spots, and what are known as "carbuncles," 35 But "buboes" are not an essential feature of Plague. Cases occur in which these manifestations of the disease are greatly delayed, or even absent, as for instance in "Pneumonic," "Gastric," and "Septicsæmic" Plague; forms of the malady which may be taken for respectively inflammation of the lungs, typhoid fever, and acute blood poisoning. Plague in these forms is always grave; not only because of the fatality of the cases, but for the reason that they, especially the "pneumonic," are highly infectuous to other persons. It is important, therefore, that in localities where Plague is present or is threatened, cases of anomalous illness of the above sorts be without loss of time brought under medical supervision. Besides the forms of Plague already referred to there is yet another, namely, the so-called "ambulant" form. In Plague of this description the affected person is hardly ill at all, presenting no definite symptoms perhaps beyond indolent, though painful, swellings in groin or armpit. Such Plague cases may nevertheless be instrumental in spreading the disease, and any persons therefore who, having been possibly exposed to Plague, exhibit these symptoms, should be isolated and watched medically until the nature of their malady has been definitely ascertained. Bacteriological Diagnosis. The Medical Officer of the Local Government Board, by a circular of the same date, gives the following directions for obtaining and forwarding for bacterioscopic examination material from a suspected case of Plague:— (a) From the living person: 1.—Clean with soap and water and then with alcohol the last phalanx of either the second or third finger. When dry, or after mopping with a clean cloth, put a piece of tape round the proximal end of the last phalanx, so as to cause venous congestion. Prick the palmar surface of this phalanx with a sterile needle, and immediately take up the exuding blood in two sterile capillary lubes such as are used for collecting vaccine lymph. These tubes when charged should be sealed at both ends. 2.—When there is a discharging buboe, collect fluid therefrom in capillary tubes as in the case of blood. When this discharge is not of a sufficiently fluid character for collection in this way place some of it in a small glass-stoppered phial, previously well washed out with alcohol, care being taken that no alcohol remains in the phial. 3.—If expectoration be obtainable, collect some in a phial in the manner prescribed in Section 2. (b) From the dead body: 1.—Cut out any inflamed lymph gland, together with some of its surrounding tissue, and place the whole in a wide-mouthed glassstoppered bottle, previously well washed out with alcohol, care being taken that no alcohol remains in the bottle. The bottle should have the stopper well secured and sealed. 36 2.—Obtain also a piece of the spleen, dealing with it in the same manner. All suspected Plague material should be carefully packed so as to avoid risk of breakage, and be immediately sent by hand to the Medical Officer of Health, Town Hall, Pancras Road, N.W. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, John F. J. Sykes, Medical Officer of Health. SMALL-POX. On Thursday, the 29th March, the s.s. Caledonia, having landed small-pox patients at Marseilles, arrived at Tilbury, and the Ship's writer, F—M—, aged 23 years, reached his home at Harrington Street on the evening of Friday, the 30th March. Within two or three days he began to feel ill and on the 7th April had a rash. On the 10th April he was medically certified as suffering from small-pox, was removed to hospital on the same day, and on the same day the Vaccination Officer was informed of the fact. On the 23rd inst. his brother, R— L— M—, aged 34, living at the same address, was also certified to be suffering from small-pox. He was removed to hospital on the same day and on the same day the Vaccination Officer was notified. His occupation was stated to be Dining Saloon Car Attendant on the London & North VVestern Railway between London and Manchester, the date of his last journey and beginning of his illness being the 20th April. He was stated to have slept alternate nights at—Stanley Grove, Longsight, Manchester, and I sent a telegram followed up by a letter to the Medical Officer of Health of Manchester stating the above facts. On the 24th April, M— A—M—, aged 55, mother of the two former patients and living at the same address, was certified to be suffering from small-pox and removed to hospital the same day, and the Vaccination Officer again notified. On the same day, the 24th April, E— A— K—, 41 years, living at James Street, and who acted as Charwoman at Harrington Street, whence the three previous cases had been removed, was certified to be suffering from small-pox, was removed to hospital and the Vaccination Officer notified the same day. The chain of infection was traced through the following cases: Date of Removal to Hospital. 10th April.—F. M., aged 23, Harrington Street, St. Pancras. Clerk on board P. and 0. s.s.

Imported Mussels and Typhoid lexer —On the 21st November and 12th December I reported upon the prevalence of Enteric Fever. The latter Report was presented to the Borough Council on 19th December, and related to the probable spread of the disease by imported Mussels. The number of cases of sickness and death from this disease in St. Pancras and London taken from 40 the Returns of the Metropolitan Asylums Board and the Registrar-General for the six weeks ending the 1st December were as follows:— 1900 Week ending. St. Pancras. London. Notifications. Deaths. Notifications. Deaths. 27th October 10 1 127 22 3rd November 16 1 148 20 10th November 32 3 179 25 17th November 26 0 152 17 24th November 17 1 112 26 1st December 11 0 127 23 My remarks upon this were as follows:— It will be observed that during the middle four weeks ending 24th November there was a great rise in the number of Enteric Fever cases, and the cases for those four weeks have been plotted upon a map, and upon the same map the cases occurring in Hampstead within a mile of the boundaries of Saint Pancras have also been plotted. From a centre formed at the spot where Queen's Crescent is crossed by the Maiden Road in Kentish Town three circles have been drawn at an increasing distance of a quarter-of-a-mile diameter. Within the three-quarters of a mile 57 cases occurred. Four of these cases were in the outer ¼-mile zone 1 being in Hampstead), 15 of the cases were in the middle ¼-mile zone (7 being in Hampstead, and 38 of the cases were within the ¼-mile centre (all in St. Pancras), and 41¾ per cent., that is, about halfway between one-third and one-half of the total cases in St. Pancras occurred between this ¼-mile circle. As a matter of fact, the proportion is even greater, because 7 cases that occurred in one house in the south-western corner of the Borough have been credited to St. Pancras temporarily, although the house, by the new boundary, was placed in Marylebone on the 9th November last. This group of cases occurred in two families, living in two rooms, the children playing together, one of the children suffering from the disease in a mild form for ten days before being admitted to hospital, and in the meanwhile spreading the disease by personal infection to the other children, who fell ill later on. Attention was first directed to Mussels as the probable cause of prevalence on account of the evidence that two children suffering from Enteric Fever were known, a little over a fortnight before falling ill, to have been reprimanded for having picked up and eaten mussels falling from the stall board of 41 a particular vendor. Inquiry then showed that a large proportion of those falling ill gave a history of eating mussels from the same source. All shellfish are known to be liable to cause poisoning in certain circumstances to susceptible persons, but certain shellfish, on account of being cultivated in the estuaries of rivers near sewage outfalls are regarded as being liable to be specifically polluted with the organisms of Enteric Fever. These shellfish are Oysters, Mussels, Escallops, Cockles, Periwinkles and Whelks. Oysters, Mussels and Escallops are sold raw, Cockles, Periwinkles and Whelks are cooked before being sold; the three last therefore may be said to be practically sterilised, and danger is more likely to arise from the three first, and in the reverse order to that mentioned, because Escallops are seldom eaten raw, Mussels are often eaten raw, and Oysters are mostly eaten raw. PUERPERAL FEVER. In connection with this disease it is interesting to note the rules and regulations to be observed by Midwives holding the certificate of the Obstetrical Society of London, published by Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co., 1899. " 10. Whenever a midwife has been in attendance upon a patient suffering from puerperal fever, or from any other illness supposed to be infectious, she must disinfect her hands and all her instruments, and have her clothing thoroughly disinfected before going to another labour." "5. Disinfection of Instruments:— (a) All glass or metal instruments must be boiled in a covered vessel for at least ten minutes. (b) All instruments which would be injured by being boiled must after use be thoroughly cleansed with soap and water, then thoroughly rinsed in clean water, and afterwards left lying as long as possible in corrosive sublimate solution (1 in 1,000)." "2. The midwife must disinfect her hands and arms as follows:—The hands and arms must first be scrubbed with soap and water, the nail brush being used for the hands and nails, particularly the grooves round the roots of the nails. The soap and water must then be rinsed off in clean water, and the hands soaked for a full minute in the corrosive sublimate solution. The hands must be well cleansed and must be soaked in the corrosive sublimate solution before each examination." DIARRHŒA AND CONDENSED MILK. Prevention of Infantile Diarrhoea.—From 70 to 75 per cent, of the deaths from diarrhoea occur in infants under one year of age, and about seven-tenths of these deaths occur during the third quarter of the year. Most of the deaths of infants from diarrhoea owe their origin to errors in feeding and food. Infants suffering from diarrhoea are seldom breast-fed children. As the large majority of diarrhœa affected children are hand or bottle-fed, and especially as a large number are fed on condensed milk, this form of food presents an opportunity of guiding mothers in methods of prevention by means of instructions upon printed labels. 42 If a demand could be created amongst the public only to purchase tinned milks with guarantees and full directions printed upon the affixed wrappers of the tins, the supply would soon follow, and be more effectual in preventing infantile diarrhœa than any other means that could be suggested. The affixed wrapper should guarantee that the milk is whole milk (not skimmed) sterilised and condensed, and unsweetened, or not containing more sugar than is necessary to approximate it to the composition of human milk. The directions should be full and explicit as to the intervals of feeding and the quantity to be used in every month of infant life, and detail the mode of preparation and all the precautions to be taken. MEASLES. The Notification of Measles.—The London County Council, by circular letter dated the 1st December, 1900, informed the Metropolitan Boroughs that the Public Health Committee of the Council had under consideration the question whether it is advisable that the Council should include "Measles" in the term "Dangerous Infectious Disease," for the purposes of the Infectious Diseases Prevention sections (particularly sees. 60 to 74) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and asked for a reply to the question—Whether the Council of this Borough are in favour of the extension to measles of the provisions contained in any of the above-mentioned sections, observing that these sections do not relate to the question of notification. This letter was before the Public Health Committee on the 12th December, 1900, and was referred to the Medical Officer of Health to report upon. The Infectious Diseases Prevention sections of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, do not refer to notification ; they refer to the compulsory cleansing and disinfection of infected premises and contents (61 to 65), the compulsory removal to hospital and detention of persons without proper accommodation to prevent the spread of infectious disease (66 and 67), the prohibition under penalty of the exposure of infected persons or things (68), the prohibition under penalty of infected persons milking animals or picking fruit (69), the prohibition under penalty of a person suffering from a dangerous infectious disease riding in a public conveyance (70), the prohibition under penalty of supplying milk from a dairy likely to spread dangerous infectious disease (71), the prohibition to retain the body of a person dying of infectious disease in a dwelling, sleeping or working-place, or to remove such a body from a hospital to such a place, or to remove such a body in a public conveyance, other than a hearse, without notifying the driver and subsequent disinfection (72 to 74). These sections will be seen to fall under four heads, namely: (1) Power to compel removal to hospital, (2) Power to compel cleansing and disinfection, (3) Power to prosecute for exposure of infected persons and things, and, (4) Powers with regard to infected dead bodies. The Metropolitan Asylums Board has not made and does not appear to intend to make any provision for the isolation of measles in hospitals, so that all cases of measles will continue to be nursed at home. If for measles, disinfection be made compulsory upon recovery, the Sanitary Authority will be called upon to carry it out, to enforce it, to prosecute in cases of non- 43 disinfection of infected rooms, things, persons, or conveyances; and, also, to effectually isolate the infected house and its inmates as nearly as possible as if it were a temporary infectious hospital. The most essential question to settle first is the proper form of disinfection after measles, and whether it is beyond the compass of the person in charge of the patient, and others, or whether it requires the appliances and skilled servants of the Sanitary Authority to perform. If an attempt is to be made to stem the spread of measles without providing hospital accommodation, the infected dwelling-house must be treated as a temporary infectious hospital, and be cleansed and disinfected thoroughly before it can be considered free. The process of disinfection should not be one whit less thorough than in the case of scarlet fever, namely: the steaming of infected bedding and clothing, and the fumigation, stripping, and cleansing of infected rooms and places. In all but a few cases this can only be done properly by the skilled servants of the Authority. The first point, therefore, to decide, is whether the Borough Council will incur the additional expense, which practically means increasing the expenditure upon disinfection from a half to as much again. A decision to disinfect at public expense after measles, at once raises the question whether it would not be better to make measles a notifiable disease straight away rather than to adopt half measures. Unless made entirely notifiable only the cases attending school will become known to the Authority, and a number of unknown cases will continue to spread the disease, children under compulsory-school age (5 years) being most liable to it and under voluntary school age (3 years) most especially so. In this way cleansing and disinfection may be brought into disrepute, the half-measures may probably fail, and a wrong conclusion be drawn. Without hospital provision for isolation the effect of notification must, of necessity, be incomplete in preventing disease, and it would be necessary to bear this in mind and to remember that scarlet lever and measles would not be comparable notifiable diseases in this respect. During 1895, the question of the notification of measles was raised in several directions, and on the 22nd January, 1896, the late Vestry of St. Pancras considered a report from me on the subject. The essential points of that report were as follows:— A.—The arguments in favour of the notification of measles:— (1) Measles causes a larger number of deaths than any other infectious disease, excepting whooping-cough and diarrhoea. (2) It is highly infectious, and the infectiousness continues after the appearance of the rash and until the branny peeling ceases. (3) It is largely spread through the medium of schools, and it is too late to close schools after the disease has obtained the hold shown by the death returns. 44 (4) The protection of schools and the prevention of epidemics would be furthered by enabling infected children to be detained at home, and by affording earlier opportunity to send printed and other instructions for dealing with the disease and preventing its spread. (5) Notification would enable isolation in hospital and disinfection of the dwelling-room and contents to be carried out. This would (a) check the spread of the disease, (b) tend to reduce the virulence of the disease by improving the surroundings, and (c) diminish the fatality by improved treatment, and (d) as measles only lasts half as long as scarlet fever, twice the number of patients could be treated in the same number of beds. B.—The arguments against the notification of measles:— (1) The maximum mortality of the disease is, during the second year of age, rapidly diminishing through childhood till it becomes insignificant, although this may be due to acquired immunity, but the fatality averages only about 5 per cent, of cases. (2) The disease is infectious before the characteristic rash appears, and during the catarrhal stage, or stage of apparent "cold in the head." (3) It mainly prevails among children before school age, and becomes more or less epidemic every other year, with extended epidemics every few years. (4) In the majority of cases medical advice is not sought; these cases would therefore not be medically certified, and, if made notifiable by parents and guardians, ignorance may be pleaded, or medical examination may have to be enforced to verify the presence or absence of the disease. (5) Admitting (a) that isolation and cleansing and disinfection check the spread, not only of measles, but also of other infectious ailments,. (b) that improved surroundings reduce the virulence of all infectious diseases, and (c) that improved treatment reduces the fatality of all diseases, and that all these are desirable aims; still the difficulties as to notification are that effective measures of isolation in hospital and thorough disinfection of dwelling rooms, will require a large amount of accommodation, and increased apparatus and staff. Assuming the fatality of measles cases to be 5 per cent., then 20 cases for every death registered would have to be provided for. The number of beds would have to be more numerous than for scarlet fever, because the number of cases of measles is greater; and although the disease only lasts half as long as scarlet fever, the fatality is less than half as great. The provision of hospital accommodation, and disinfection at public expense, would entail a large expenditure, practically the doubling of the number of beds in the infectious hospitals, and the doubling of disinfecting staffs and apparatus. The conclusion drawn was that in large towns the notification of measles is simply a question of expenditure. 45 On the 2nd September in that year the late St. Pancras Vestry adopted the Resolution—that it is desirable to provide proper means for isolation of measles previously to incurring any expenditure on notifiation. On the 8th June, 1898, the late Vestry had before them a communication from the London County Council, forwarding copy of a letter received from the School Board for London, asking the Council to include measles in the term dangerous infectious disease, for the purpose set out in Section 68 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and asking if the Vestry would be in favour of the extension to measles of the provisions contained in Section 68. The late Vestry expressed no opinion. On the 6th July, 1898, a further communication to the same effect was under consideration, when the late Vestry resolved that until proper means of isolation are available, it is not desirable to extend to measles the provisions contained in that Section, or to make measles a notifiable disease, and that a reply to this effect be forwarded to the London County Council. Section 68 is as follows:—"(1) If any person (a) while suffering from any dangerous infectious disease wilfully exposes himself without proper precautions against spreading the said disease in any street, public place, shop, or inn; or (ft) being in charge of any person so suffering so exposes such sufferer; or (c) gives, lends, sells, transmits, removes, or exposes, without previous disinfection, any bedding, clothing, or other articles which have been exposed to infection from any such disease; shall be liable to a fine not exceeding five pounds. (2) Provided that proceedings under this section shall not be taken against persons transmitting with proper precautions any bedding, clothing or other articles for the purpose of having the same disinfected." It is obvious that if this section be applied to measles in order to comply with the requirement in (1) (c) of the section, disinfection in every case of measles will be obligatory, and the Borough Council must enforce it in every case coming to their knowledge. Whether the application of cleansing and disinfection to measles in some cases, without the notification of all cases, will check measles epidemics in schools, is a question of experiment. School Boards are for the purpose of increasing the school attendance of children at school ages. Sanitary Authorities are for the purpose of protecting the health of children (and adults) at all ages. Experience shows that measles prevails mostly amongst children under five years of age, and that it creeps into schools mainly through the baby and infant classes, in which the ages range from three to five years. Upon the value of school teaching to " infants " between three and five years of age, apart from the relief to mothers during school hours, I have formed no opinion, but it would materially help in the consideration of the means of prevention, to weigh the relative effects of school attendance upon "infants" in respect to the amount of education gained and the amount of infection spread. This is a subject upon which a public or official inquiry might be held with great advantage both to education and to public health. As bearing upon this aspect of this question, I append Table A, showing the distribution of the mortality of measles in the Registration Sub-Districts of St. Pancras, under and over 5 years of age, for the last eight years, from 46 which it will he seen that during that period 94.6 per cent, of the total deaths have occurred under 5 years of age. In Table B it is seen also that in London, of the deaths from measles, about 95 per cent, occur under 5 years of age, about 80 per cent, under 3 years, and about 40 per cent, in the second year of life, so that in order to obtain sufficient control over measles to stem its prevalence, the knowledge of school cases only, followed by disinfection, would be insufficient. In Table C, quoted from the Annual Report for 1898 of the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council, will be seen the apparent influence of the cessation of school attendance during the summer holidays in reducing the mortality from measles. If a Sanitary Authority decide to provide an additional steam disinfecting chamber, vans, and other appliances, to increase the number of disinfectors when required, and also the expenditure upon stripping and cleansing, but not to adopt compulsory notification, then the following course would be pursued:— 1. Head teachers forthwith notifiy to the Medical Officer of Health the exclusion from school of any scholar suffering from measles, or living in a house where another person is so suffering. 2. Upon the receipt of the notification, the Sanitary Inspector reports as to the patient and the room, and makes enquiry as to the addresses of all the schools attended by all the children in the house. 3. A copy of the precautionary handbill is sent to the head of each of the families in the house. 4. A copy of the notification is sent to the head teacher of each of the schools attended by the children in the infected house. 5. A notice as to cleansing and disinfection is served upon the person in charge of the infected patient. 6. The person in charge failing to do the requisite cleansing and disinfection, the Sanitary Authority undertakes it. 7. The Sanitary Inspector inspects the room or rooms as to satisfactory disinfection, so that in epidemic periods the Inspectors' time would become largely occupied with measles. It is important that this should be borne in mind, and also that whether made notifiable or not, the disinfection after measles would incur the same expense of staff, &c. The Sections of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, that do not involve expenditure of the Borough Council upon compulsory notification, hospital provision, or responsibility for disinfection, it may be expedient to apply to measles. The Sections relating to, or involving responsibility by the Borough Council for the cleansing and disinfection of interiors and their contents after measles, can be applied to measles so soon as the necessary expenditure is approved. 47 The Sections relating to hospital provision are within the power of either the Metropolitan Asylums Board or the Borough Council to apply to measles, having approved of the necessary expenditure, and obtained confirmation by the Local Government Board of the provision to be made. If the Sections relating to or involving responsibility by the Borough Council for cleansing and disinfection are applied to measles, the Sections relating to notification were better applied also rather than not, in order that the cases may be all included and dealt with, and those medically attended medically certified, always understanding that in the absence of hospital provision, qualified results may be expected.

The number of deaths from measles monthly in London is from about 100 to about 350, according to the degree of prevalence, and the case mortality varies from 1½ to a maximum of perhaps 5 per cent. of the cases, so that the number of cases in the month may vary from about 2,000 in non-epidemic times to over 20,000 in a very severe epidemic, but as the object of hospital isolation is to prevent and not to treat epidemics, lower figures than this maximum must be assumed. Whether or not the cases in the month are 2000 or 4000, and whether or not beds can be provided to isolate the whole, it may be contended that the isolation of those cases most prone to spread the disease must tend to diminish its prevalence and to protect school children. Assuming that a thousand beds can be set aside or provided for measles, and that this would not accommodate the whole of the cases applying for admission, it would be possible, by limiting the admissions, or by requiring a statement as to the conditions surrounding each case, to select for admission those less capable of being isolated at home. For instance, it might be considered 50 desirable to limit the admission to children of school age and under, but as 99.5 per cent. of the deaths from measles occur at these ages, this limitation is by the nature of the disease already imposed. As a matter of fact, of the mortality from measles, about 20 per cent. occurs under one year, about 40 per cent. from one to two years, 20 per cent. from two to three, 10 per cent. from three to four, and 5 per cent. from four to five years; that is to say, nearly 95 per cent. under five years of age, and considerably under 1 per cent. over ten years of age. Limitation as to age is unnecessary so far as the higher ages are concerned, and is undesirable so far as the lower ages are concerned, because in a family the younger children are just as likely to spread the disease as older children. Selection would be the best method of limiting the number of cases, and this might be carried out by requiring every application for the admission of a case of measles to be accompanied by a statement of (1) the number of rooms in the dwelling occupied by the family, and (2) the number of children under ten years in the family (it is important that the age should be ten years, because this age fits in with Vital Statistics, Bye-laws, Inspections, Sanitary Requirements, etc., of the Authority). From these statements priority of admission could be given to children from the smallest dwellings and from the largest families. ISOLATION.

PANCRAS BOROUGH COUNCIL. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Pancras Road, N.W. 25th September, 1900. Sir, Infectious Diseases. The Vestry at their last meeting received a report from the Health Committee, that on the 16th of August last, a person residing in Chamberlain Street was certified as suffering from Diphtheria and was on the 18th of that month removed to hospital. On the 22nd August another person at the same address was also certified to be suffering from Diphtheria, and was removed the same day to hospital. On the 28th of that month another person (a girl) at the same address was similarly certified to be suffering from this disease, and on the same day was removed to hospital. With reference to this last case it appears that although the patient was suffering from Diphtheria, her relatives were allowed to take her away from the hospital on the 3rd of September—her father having presented a medical certificate to the effect that the child could be safely treated at home. The Medical Officer of Health of this Parish received intimation next morning by post that the patient had been removed to Chamberlain Street, and upon inquiry it was found that there were three families, consisting of nine adults and eight children, living in a house containing eight rooms. No proper precautions could be taken therefore to prevent the spread of the disease with any prospect of success. The child has since died. The Vestry are of opinion that the resident Medical Officer of a hospital should not permit any person suffering from any dangerous infectious disease to be removed from the hospital, except to another hospital, until assured by the Medical Officer of Health of the district to which the patient is to be removed, that the patient would be provided with lodging or accommodation in which proper precautions could be taken to prevent the spread of the disease, and if not so assured, should not permit the patient to be removed until application has been made to a Magistrate detailing the circumstances, and requesting a direction that the patient be detained in the hospital until a given date, and the Magistrate has declined to make such direction in accordance with Section 67 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which is to the following effect. (1) "A Justice on being satisfied that a person suffering from any "dangerous infectious disease is in a hospital, and would not, on "leaving the hospital, be provided with lodging or accommodation "in which proper precautions could be taken to prevent the "spreading of the disease by such person, may direct such person "to be detained in the hospital at the cost of the Metropolitan "Asylums Managers during the time limited by the Justice. Any 52 "Justice may enlarge the time as often as appears to him necessary "for preventing the spread of the disease." (2) "The direction may be carried into execution by any Officer of any "Sanitary Authority, or of the Metropolitan Asylums Managers, "or by any Inspector of Police, or any Officer of the hospital." By direction of the Vestry I have forwarded a copy of this communication to each of the hospitals situated within this Borough, and also to those adjacent thereto. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, C. Barrett. The Clerk, Vestry Clerk. Metropolitan Asylums Board. Metropolitan Asylums Board, Embankment, E.C. 19th October, 1900. Sir,— Hospitals Department. Infections Cases in Chamberlain Street, St. Pancras. I beg to acquaint you that your letter of the 25th ult. was submitted to the Hospitals Committee of this Board, at their last meeting, and by them it was referred to their Special and Medical Sub-Committee to deal with. This Special Sub-Committee have had your communication before them, and your further letter of the 1st October, giving the names and addresses of the persons referred to, together with (1) a report thereon by the Medical Superintendent of the Western Hospital, and (2) all the correspondence which has passed between the Acting Medical Superintendent and Dr. Sykes, your Medical Officer of Health, and I have been instructed by the Sub-Committee to write to you upon the subject. While the Sub-Committee are in full sympathy with your Vestry in their efforts to check the spread of infectious disease, and to prevent the discharge from hospital of patients who have not completely recovered, they are unable to concur fully in your Vestry's opinion as to the duty of the Resident Medical Officer, which appears to go beyond the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to which you refer. They have, however, given directions to their several Medical Superintendents that upon any demand for the removal of a patient still in an infectious state, they are to communicate with the Medical Officer of Health of the District to which it is proposed to take such patient, so that this Officer may have an opportunity of judging whether the patient would be "provided 53 with lodging or accommodation in which proper precautions could be taken to prevent the spreading of the disease," and of taking steps to obtain an order of detention, if he is not satisfied, and in the meantime every lawful means will be used to discourage removal; but until a Justice's Order is actually made, the Board has not the power of detention. As regards the case in question, I may say that the Special and Medical Sub-Committee did not see that any blame was attachable to the Acting Medical Superintendent in the action which he felt bound to take. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, T. Duncombe Mann. Clerk to the Board. C. Barrett, Esq., Vestry Clerk, St. Pancras, N.W. Exclusion from school on account of infectious diseases.—The protection of schools, especially day-schools, from infectious diseases is surrounded by difficulties and complexities. The certifiable infectious diseases are small-pox, scarlatina, diphtheria or membranous croup, typhus, enteric, continued, relapsing and puerperal fevers, cholera, erysipelas, and plague. All children in houses in which these diseases exist are excluded from school, except in the case of puerperal fever, erysipelas, and enteric fever. Of the non-certifiable infectious diseases, in the case of chicken-pox, measles, whooping-cough and mumps, forms are supplied to the head teachers of schools for the notification of children excluded from school either as suffering from the diseases or as coming from infected houses, in order to encourage exclusion and the prevention of the spread of the diseases bv enabling the Government grant to be recovered upon the certificate of the Medical Officer of Health. It has been held also that german measles should be classed with measles, and that scabies (itch), impetigo contagiosa, ringworm, ophthalmia and sore throat are diseases to he excluded. It is more difficult to decide what diseases in the house should preclude a healthy child from attending school than in what diseases it should be necessary to exclude a suffering child, since most teachers would send home a child suffering from unhealthy symptoms, such as a rash or eruption that might indicate eruptive fever, diarrhoea or vomiting that might precede cholera or other zymotic disease, cough or expectoration suspicious of whooping-cough or consumption, sore throat or hoarseness premonitory of scarlet fever or diphtheria, snuffling or nasal catarrh forerunning measles, not to mention also swollen glands, flushing, shivering, and drowsiness. The question is whether a child living in a house in which another child is suffering from scabies, impetigo contagiosa, ringworm, ophthalmia, or sore throat, should be excluded from school ? 54 DISINFECTION.

As a few Sanitary Authorities are supplying diphtheria antitoxin free of charge, and a few are selling it at cost price, and some others are being advised to adopt a similar course, it is opportune to consider the bearings of inoculations and vaccinations. The term vaccination is generally applied to the inoculation of vaccine lymph, but for the sake of uniformity and comparison, it is convenient to drop the terms "vaccination" and "lymph," and speak merely of the inoculation of antivariolous fluid in the same manner as the inoculation of any other antidisease fluid may be spoken of. Inoculations are of two kinds, curative and preventive, the former being studied as part of the new branch of therapeutics known as serumtherapy, and the latter in connection with prophylaxis—that is to say, the former for curative, and the latter for preventive treatment. Fluids for inoculation upon man, as distinguished from farm stock, are being used in connection with the following diseases: Variola (small-pox), Diphtheria, Streptococcal or Septic Diseases (especially Puerperal Fever and Erysipelas), Tetanus or Lockjaw, Pneumonia or Inflammation of the Lungs, Typhoid or Enteric Fever, Plague, and Cholera. The difference between curative and preventive inoculation fluids is that whereas the former are used after the diagnosis of the disease is made upon persons suffering from the disease it is sought to cure, the latter are used upon healthy persons, or, at least, upon persons not suffering from the disease it is sought to prevent. It is necessary to make the distinction clear because Clinicians recommend that curative inoculation fluids should be used early, strong, and in large doses, and Bacteriologists point out that the earlier the administration of the fluids at the onset of the disease the greater the effect, and the later the smaller, showing that, in one sense, the curative effect may be regarded as preventive, but in this sense the demarcation between cure and prevention would be destroyed. Therefore, it is to be understood that a "preventive" inoculation or injection is employed upon a healthy person as a means of protection against a disease, and a" curative "inoculation or injection is employed upon a person sickening for or suffering from a disease.

With the exception of the two first, the sera for inoculation or injection are in more or less experimental stages still, the periods in some are not ascertained and in others are not sufficiently corroborated, so that they must not be regarded as reliable, but as merely tentative. In the course of time, serumtherapy will be more perfected. It would occupy too much space now to enter into a dissertation upon the merits and demerits of serumtherapy, but in Veterinary Medicine it is now practised with success in a number of diseases upon a large scale upon domestic animals. 58 IV.—SANITATION. § 1.

DWELLINGS. House to House Inspections.—The number of streets, or parts of streets, inspected from house to house during the year was 3, consisting of 43 houses, containing 314 rooms, all occupied, let to 110 families. Houses occupied in separate dwellings.—These consist of houses (I.) so constructed or (II.) adapted or (III.) sublet so as to be occupied in dwellings that may be (A) self-contained or (B) not self-contained. (A) Houses occupied in separate and self-contained dwellings in St. Pancras are set out in List I. appended to this Report. Such dwellings-may be completely self-contained dwellings, or partly self-contained. In the latter case, when the w.c., scullery, or washhouse, anyone or more of these, are not within the front door of the dwelling, but are on the same floor and reserved for the sole use of the dwelling, such dwelling may be conveniently styled selfcomplete dwellings. (B) Houses occupied in separate but not self-contained dwellings embrace houses constructed so that the w.c.'s, sculleries, washhouses, or open lobbies, any one or more of these, are on the same floor as and used in association with dwellings forming associated dwellings; and houses so constructed that every separate room of every separate dwelling opens directly on to a staircase or corridor used in common, in addition to the domestic and sanitary conveniences being so used, and the dwellings in such houses may appropriately be termed common dwellings, the only severance being the separate rooms. The lines of cleavage between a house, a dwelling, a lodging, &c, appear to be those (1) of structure and (2) of usage. The structural are the degrees of severance of one tenant's occupation from another's, and the usage the degrees of control by the landlord in the matter of access (i.e., locking the door), of service (i.e., rendering domestic service), of furniture (i.e., furnished apartments), and of residence (i.e., residence of the landlord upon the premises). Section 70 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, Part IV., provides that in letting for habitation to persons of the working classes a house, or part of a house, there shall be implied the condition that the house is at the commencement of the holding in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation. This is very vague, and additional provision is required somewhat to the following effect:—In letting for habitation as a dwelling part of a house there shall be provided a sufficient and accessible water supply and liquid waste on the same storey, or adjoining half-storey, as the dwelling or part of the dwelling is situated, and in the absence of such water supply and liquid waste it shall be implied that the dwelling is not reasonably fit for human habitation. Underground Dwellings.—During the year notices were served upon the owners of two underground rooms let separately from the rest of the house as dwellings to discontinue their use as dwellings. Registered Tenement Houses.—The number of houses let in separate dwellings or in lodgings to members of more than one family, and registered under the Bye-laws, was at the end of the year 834, and of these 104 inspections and 158 re-inspections (after notices) were made. In addition 2090 house to house inquiries in tenemented streets were made as to the number of dwellings, &c., in each house, and 41 houses were measured and entered for registration. 63 Registered Common Lodging Houses.—The number of Common Lodging Houses in St. Pancras is 25 in 17 separate premises, as set out in List II. in the appendix, and they are supervised by the London County Council. Canal Boats.—During the year 463 visits were paid to wharves for the purpose of inspecting canal boats used as dwellings, and the canal. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890. Part I. Scheme. On the 12th February, 1891, the Medical Officer of Health of St. Pancras represented to the London County Council the three areas known as Somers Town, Brantome Place, and Prospect Terrace, under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. The London County Council considered that the areas should not be dealt with under Part I., and after much intercommunication between the Council and the Vestry of St. Pancras the Vestry appealed to the Home Secretary. An inquiry was held on his behalf and he made an award on the 27th June, 1893, to the following effect:— As to Area No. 1, Somers Town. (a) That so much that lies to the west of Chalton Street, but south of Drummond Street, excluding Christopher Place, should be dealt with by the London County Council, under Part I. of the Act. (b) That Christopher Place, and so much as lies to the west of Chalton Street, but north of Drummond Street, should be dealt with by the Vestry under Part II. of the Act, without any contribution from the County Council. (c) That so much as lies to the east of Chalton Street should be dealt with by the Vestry under Part II. of the Act, the County Council contributing one-third of the expense. As to Area No. 2, Prospect Terrace and Derry Street. As to Area No. 3, Brantome Place. That these Areas should be dealt with by the Vestry under Part II. of the Act, the County Council contributing one-half of the expense. Area No. 1 (a)—The London County Council is now dealing with the area "that lies to the west of Chalton Street but south of Drummond Street, excluding Christopher Place," by demolition and reconstruction under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. Pakt II. Schemes. Area No. 1 (b)—The Vestry of St. Pancras in 1893 dealt with the area that "lies to the west of Chalton Street, but north of Drummond Street," house by house under Part II. of the Act by serving notices on the owners of the individual houses to abate nuisances, and execute such works and do such things as might be necessary, and d'd not direct any scheme for demolition and reconstruction to be prepared. 64 Area No. 1 (c)—The Vestry of St. Pancras on the 15th January, 1896, adopted two schemes under Part II. of the Act for dealing with (1) Eastnor Place, etc., and (2) with Chapel Grove, etc., in the area that "lies to the east of Chalton Street." On the 11th May, 1898, the Vestry rescinded the scheme as to Chapel Grove, etc., and adopted an amended scheme dealing with Chapel Grove, etc. On the 7th September, 1898, the seal of the Vestry was affixed to the amended Chapel Grove, etc., Scheme and Eastnor Place, etc., Scheme. On the 18th and 19th June, 1899, the Local Government Board held an inquiry into the two schemes, and the London County Council put forward an alternative scheme for dealing with Chapel Grove. On the 15t,h November, 1899, the Local Government Board communicated to the Vestry that they were satisfied that the areas were such as to require a scheme of reconstruction, and that they proposed to sanction the scheme subject to the modification of the Chapel Grove scheme of the London County Council, and to the acquisition of No. 13, 15 and 17, Chapel Street by agreement. The Vestry ascertained and informed the Local Government Board that these three houses could not be so acquired, and that the Midland Railway Company have become the freeholders, and the Local Government Board has since pointed out that compulsory acquisition in order to carry out the scheme as modified will necessitate commencing de novo as to the service of notices as far as the three houses are concerned, and the holding of a further inquiry. Areas Nos. 2 and 3.—The Vestry of St. Pancras on the 15th April, 1896, sealed two schemes, one in respect of the Prospect Terrace Area and the other of the Brantome Place Area. On the 10th and 16th March, 1897, the Local Government Board held an Inquiry into the two schemes, on the 25th June, 1897, the Board by letter oalled upon the Vestry to provide additional land for rehousing, in order that at least 800 persons of the 1300 to be displaced from the two sites should be rehoused in new buildings. In the course of correspondence on the 3rd May, 1898, the Board stated that the Vestry must agree to the purchase of additional land before the Board would make an Order sanctioning the schemes with the necessary modifications. The London County Council considered that the Local Government Board have no power to add additional land to a scheme under Part II., and declined to contribute to the additional cost. The Vestry communicated with the Home Secretary on the 22nd September, 1900, as to the interpretation of his Award, and received a reply that provisions as to rehousing are an integral part of the scheme to which the London County Council can be required to contribute. The County Council have been informed that the Borough Council will prefer a claim when the proper time arrives. Instructions have been given to prepare the necessary plans, estimates, and details to be forwarded to the Local Government Board to add to the schemes before confirmation. Four different Authorities have been concerned in the framing of these three last Schemes, namely, the Home Office, the Local Government Board, the London County Council and the Vestry now the Borough Council, with the result that at the end of ten years after representation the schemes have not yet been confirmed. 65 Part II.—Individual Houses. On the 10th December, 1890, the Medical Officer of Health of St. Pancras represented the dwelling houses Nos. 1 and 2, Thanet Court, Thanet Street, St. Pancras, as unfit for human habitation. Proceedings were taken under the enactments applied for the purpose of closing the premises as set out in the third Schedule of the Housing of the Working Classea Act, 1890, against the Skinners' Company. The Magistrate held that a leaseholder with only two years of his lease to run was the person to be served with notice of proceedings for closing an insanitary dwelling under Section 32 of 53 and 54 Vict., Cap. 70. The leaseholder received rents and profits and the Skinners Company were the freehold Owners. This decision was appealed against and was heard in the Queen's Bench Division on the 5th and 9th June, 1891, Osborne v. the Skinners' Company, before Mr. Justice Cave and Mr. Justice Charles, and the appeal was allowed with costs and the case remitted to the Magistrate with the opinion that the respondents were the Owners upon whom the Closing Order should be made. (The Judgment appeared in the Minutes of the Vestry of St. Pancras 1st July, 1891.) In the meantime the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, had been passed and this Act contained a further definition of Owner, and the first notices having lapsed fresh Notices were served upon the Skinners' Company. Upon the application for Summonses, the Magistrate declined to grant summonses against the Owners as defined by the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, and thought the person who ought to be summoned was the person who was the Owner within the meaning of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. A rule was then applied for in the Queen's Bench Division and was argued on the 18th June, 1892, before Mr. Justice Wright and Mr. Justice Collins when a Rule Absolute was made requiring the Magistrate to issue the Summonses against the owner as defined by the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. (The Judgment appeared in the Minutes of the Vestry of St. Pancras 29th June, 1892.) The cases in which Closing Orders under Part II. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, have been applied for and not granted were in respect to the following premises, 90, Cromer Street (Cottage in rear of), 3, Robert's Yard, Drummond Street, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, Weir's Passage (No. 3 being a Hall and No. 5 being closed by a Closing Order), the odd numbers being on the South side, and the even numbers on the North side, beginning at the east end of the Passage. 90, Cromer Street, Gray's Inn Road (Cottage in rear of), was represented by the Medical Officer of Health on the 13th December, 1890, as unfit for human habitation, and on the 17th December the Vestry of Saint Pancras resolved that Notice be given to render the premises fit for human habitation or in default that legal proceedings be taken. On the 6th January, 1891, Notice was served, and not being complied with, a Summons was issued on February 17th, and was heard on the 24th February at the Clerkenwell Police Court and was dismissed on the Magistrate's view. Although called the cottage in the rear of 90, Cromer Street, the building formed part of and was a structural addition to and continuation of the rear of 90, Cromer Street. The Magistrate suggested that the additional structure should be dealt with as an obstructive building. Since then the demolition and reconstruction of other properties at the rear have improved the conditions of light and air of 90, Cromer Street. 66 3, Robert's Yard, Drummond Street, Euston Road, was represented by the Medical Officer of Health as unfit for human habitation on the 28th April, 1891, was considered by the Vestry on the 6th May, 1891, when it was resolved that Notice be given to render the premises fit for human habitation, and in default that legal proceedings be taken. Notice was served on the 28th May and not complied with. On the 22nd June a Summons was issued, and the case was heard on the 29th June at Clerkenwell Police Court. It was adjourned for the Magistrate to view the premises, and on the 13th July, 1891, the Magistrate refused to make a Closing Order. The Owner voluntarily closed the premises a few weeks afterwards and they have not since been occupied as a dwelling. Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, Weir's Passage were represented by the Medical Officer of Health as unfit for human habitation on the 8th August, 1895, were considered by the Vestry on the 4th September, when it was resolved that Notice be given to render the premises fit for human habitation, and in default that legal proceedings be taken. Notices were served on the 7th September and not complied with, and on the 14th November Summonses were issued and heard at the Clerkenwell Police Court, in respect of the even numbers on the 22nd, and of the odd numbers on the 23rd November, 1895. The case of No. 5, Weir's Passage was adjourned one week until the 30th November, on which date a Closing Order was made in reference to the premises. The cases of No. 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, Weir's Passage were adjourned one month until the 20th December, 1895. In the meantime these premises were inspected by the Magistrate on the 9th December, when he found some of them very recently touched up and repaired temporarily by decoration and whitewashing, which had been done immediately before his visit of inspection, and he stated that the manner in which such repairs had been made would be taken into consideration on the question of costs, and he specified what further ought to be done by the Owners in order to put the houses into such a condition as to ultimately avoid Closing Orders. On the 20th December the Summonses were further adjourned until the 20th March, on which date the Magistrate refused to make Closing Orders, and made no Orders as to costs. (The letters from the Solicitors in reference to these houses appeared in the Minutes of the Vestry of St. Pancras of the 22nd January, 1896, and 15th April, 1896.) The question has also been asked why Closing Orders have been sought under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, rather than under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, since the procedure is similar in the two Acts, the only material difference being that under the former Act the Sanitary Authority may, after obtaining a Closing Order, proceed to pass a Resolution to demolish, and under the latter Act they cannot, the inference being that unless it were intended to demolish the buildings action would be taken under the Public Health Act. Under the latter Act the owner of a less term than 21 years is entitled to be heard upon the application for a Closing Order, whereas under the former he is not. There is also a difference between the Owner of a house to be demolished after having been closed by a Closing Order under Part II. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, and the Owner of a house forming one of a group of houses that the Local Authority have decided to demolish for the purpose of carrying out a small 67 scheme under the same Part of the same Aet; in the former case the Owner has no claim against the Local Authority for compensation, and in the latter he has, because, in the former, the Authority can pass a Resolution to demolish and can themselves demolish a building without acquiriug the property, whereas in the latter the acquisition of the property must be part of the scheme. The anomaly appears to be that, on the one hand, when the Authority deals with houses individually, if they can obtain Closing Orders from the Magistrates, they can demolish without paying any compensation for the buildings; on the other hand, when the Authority deals with houses in groups they do not require fo obtain Closing Orders from the Magistrates, but must pay some kind of compensation for the buildings. Another anomaly appears to be that a Medical Officer of Health must represent an individual house as unfit for human habitation under Part II., but cannot represent a group of houses or email area under Part II., but only under Part I., and then only to the London County Council, not to the Metropolitan Borough Council. Would it not be desirable to give to four or more householders the power to complain to the Medical Officer of Health of a small group of houses as well as of an individual house, and to give the Medical Officer of Health the power of representing to the Metropolitan Borough Council a small group of houses under Part II., as well as an individual house ? When a Local Authority has decided to deal by scheme with a small group of houses under Part II., either on representation or upon their own initiative under Section 39, should they not be enabled by the Local Government Board as soon as that Board is satisfied of the desirability for a scheme, to close such houses as may be considered unfit for human habitation, instead of waiting, may be years, for the confirmation of the Scheme ? The cost of acquiring the land, and of acquiring and demolishing the buildings for an improvement scheme under the Housing of the Working Classes Act is not recouped, because the re-arrangement of the site reduces the area of land available for building, and the restriction of the reduced building-area to the purpose of erecting working-class dwellings reduces the value of the land. The loss entailed by these great reductions in values is due, firstly, to preventing the site from being used for any other purpose than artizans' dwellings, and secondly, to preventing the area from being so much covered by buildings as it might be if it were not ear-marked for artizans' dwellings. The persons interested in the property are not responsible for the imposition of either of these restrictions, and it is difficult to understand how they could be made to pay for them. It might, however, be considered whether, for the sake of clearness and differentiation, a scheme of demolition should not be made separately from but coincidently with a scheme of reconstruction for the same site. This would enable the demolition scheme to be saddled with its own proper costs, especially those of re-arranging the area, and laying it out anew for building, and of restricting the building site to working-class dwellings. And would enable a scheme of reconstruction to start unloaded by costs of clearance. It might also be considered whether it would not be advisable to keep a scheme of reconstruction and a scheme of additional construction separate, whether forming part of a demolition scheme or not, as the circumstances of reconstruction upon an existing site and of construction upon additional lands vary. May not the inclusion of additional lands for additional 68 construction in a scheme of demolition so swell the cost as to act as a deterrent to the improvement of insanitary areas ? Would not economy be served if an authority had power to exchange an inconvenient or unsuitable site or part of a site for land elsewhere, or to sell and repurchase land elsewhere more suitable for rehousing, in the case of a group of houses? At present this power appears to be restricted to an individual house, after a closing order has been obtained from a magistrate, and a demolition order made by a local authority. By lowering the rate of interest upon a loan for a scheme, and by diminishing the amount of the periodical instalments in repayment of the principal by extending the repayment over a longer period, the burden of cost of a scheme will fall less heavily as an annual charge. The period of repayment that has been advocated is at least sixty years for buildings, and one hundred years for land. It has also been advocated that a Local Authority should be empowered to hold the land and any buildings thereon in perpetuity. As bearing upon the reconstruction of houses demolished, it must be pointep out that every class of house that is demolished, or doomed to demolition, with rare exception, can be inhabited by the working classes, and in most instances is ultimately sub-divided and sub-let to the working classes. The consequence of the demolition of dwelling houses is, in nearly all cases, to diminish the working class dwelling accommodation in the neighbourhood. Although the houses may not be at the moment occupied by the working classes they are working class dwellings in posse, and will be such dwellings in esse as soon as the pressure of population compels that inevitable result, and if demolition is going on this result is not long delayed. Saint Pancras has suffered very severely from non-recognition of this fact, as Parliament has empowered the demolition of numbers of houses for which no dwelling accommodation has been provided in substitution, the Standing Orders of the House limiting the substitutional accommodation to be provided only for persons earning less than 30s. per week, when more than 15 houses outside and 20 houses inside London are taken. The essential point is the existence of a house capable of being used as a dwelling, or sub-let in a number of dwellings, and when dwelling houses are demolished an equal amount of cubic dwelling space should be provided in their stead, as near as possible to the site, the distance from the site being necessarily greatest in the most built upon districts. Railway Companies—On referring to § 2, Open Spaces, it will be seen that 249 acres of land in St. Pancras are occupied by the stations and depots of great Railway Companies. While admitting that the public must be ministered to by great [railways, it must also be urged that any local injury caused to St. Pancras by great railways should be borne by London or rather by England as a whole. How great this local injury is in the direction of creating a dearth of housing accommodation may be guaged by allowing a thousand square yards of land to a house and ten persons as occupants, then 249 acres would house at the very least 12,050 persons, and possibly twice that number. 69 Part III. — Additional Dwelling Accommodation. The Borough Council now possess power to adopt Part III. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, which includes power to acquire land (Sect. 57), to lease, appropriate, or purchase existing working class dwelling houses and to erect or convert buildings into dwelling-houses (Sects 57-53), and to manage and regulate dwelling-houses (Sections 61-2 and Schedule VI.) belonging to the Borough Council. The limitation of the exercise of the power within the Borough only is removed by the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1900 (63 & 64 Vict, cap. 59). BATHS AND WASH-HOUSES. The erection of the new Baths and Wash-houses in Prince of Wales Road, Kentish Town, is making progress. § 4.—SCHOOLS. In accordance with the resolution adopted by the late Vestry of St. Pancras on the 17th February, 1897—that Infants' and Girls' Schools should be inspected from time to time, and that this duty should be undertaken during the winter months by the Woman Sanitary Inspector—59 inspections and 8 reinspections of public and private elementary schools have been made by her, and will be found accounted for in the Report of the Woman Inspector under the next Section. § 5.—FACTORIES A.ND WORKSHOPS. Reports of Inspectors. - The following are the Reports made to me by the Sanitary Inspectors of Factories and Workshops:— Public Health Department, Town Hall, St. Pancras, N.W., April, 1901. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to report that during the year ending 29th December, 1900, the following work has been done :— Bakehouses.—These have been regularly inspected both in April and October, and the necessary cleansing and limewhiting done. Only in a few cases (60) was it necessary to serve notices, the conditions generally being satisfactory. There are now 200 Bakehouses on the Register, 182 being in use as bakehouses, and 18 unoccupied or used for other purposes. In the revision of the boundaries of the New Boroughs two bakehouses are transferred to other districts, and three are brought into this Borough. Factories.—Some of the Factories in the South and part of the East divisions have been inspected as to sanitary conveniences and drainage, also a few Factories in other parts of the district upon receipt of complaints, or for drainage works, and notices served where occasion required. 70 Only in one instance was it found necessary to apply for a summons, an Abatement Order being made. The Factories visited have generally been satisfactory. Workshops.—Some of the workshops in the South and part of East divisions have been inspected, and particulars obtained for the register. Many workshops have been inspected in other parts of the district upon receipt of complaint or notice of drainage work, and where found necessary notices served for the abatement of Nuisances. Generally the workshops were found satisfactory. Smoke Shafts.— During the year 118 complaints of black smoke were received—250 separate observations of from one to two hours duration were made. 25 Notices for the abatement of the Nuisances were served with satisfactory results. The Borough Council's two chimneys in Georgiana Street and Longford Street are the worst offenders, and attention has been called to these by mo without, however, any material improvement. Effluvia Businesses.—Time has not permitted any special attention being given to these yet. One complaint was received and attended to by me. Generally.—During the temporary absence of the district Sanitary Inspectors through illness or resignation, etc., I have had charge of the South Division for two months one week, and part of East Division one week, also superintending drainage works in Factory and Workshop premises in various parts of the District, and preparing plans for combined drainage as occasion required.

The number of persons employed in the various classes of promises under iuspection is, in round numbers :— Factories . . . . .. .. 3500 Workshops . . .. .. .. 3000 Laundries .. . . .. .. 600 Although there are only 86 Factories on the Register, the large number of women employed in them makes them an important part of a Woman Inspector's work. As regards the distribution of work during the year, roughly speaking, it may be said to have been divided as follows :— January and February were taken up with the completion of the Winter Inspection of Workshops and the Winter Inspection of Factories. March, April, May—Inspection of new Workshops. First Summer Inspection of Workshops A. June—Summer Inspection of Workshops B. July, August—Second Summer Inspection of Workshops A. Schools. Summer Inspection of Laundries. 73 September—Summer Inspection of Factories. October, November—Winter Inspection of Workshops A. Domestic Workshops, December— Winter Inspection of Workshops. There are about 60 classes of workshops in St. Pancras, each class capable of sub-division. The busy seasons differ in each class, and are not constant in any trade, but vary from year to year as trade fluctuates. All this makes it difficult to work on a systematic plan. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, A. J. Safford, Sanitary Inspector Workshops (Women). Workplaces.—The following case heard on June 15th, 1900, and reported in the Units Law Reports, throws some light upon what are intended to be included as workplaces : Bennett v. Harding. This case raised the question whether a stable and stable-yard constituted a "work-place" within the meaning of section 38, subsection 1, of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, so as to make it necessary for the owner or occupier of such premises to provide sufficient and suitable accommodation in the way of sanitary conveniences for the persons employed in or in attendance at such premises. The respondent was the owner or occupier of premises in Ormond Yard, within the jurisdiction of the Holborn District Board of Works. The appellant, the sanitary inspector of the Board of Works, served a notice on the respondent requiring him to provide the necessary sanitary conveniences in accordance with section 38, sub-section 2 of the Act. The respondent failed to comply with this notice, and thereby, as the appellant contended, rendered himself liable to a fine of £20, and a further penalty of 40s. for every day during which the non-compliance continued, he accordingly laid a complaint against the respondent. The premises in question consisted of ten stables and a stable-yard, and were in the occupation of the respondent, who was a cab proprietor in a large way of business. He kept on the premises i 10 horses and a large number of cabs, of which he was the owner. He employed upon the premises a number of men as horse-keepers and cab-cleaners. His business consisted in letting out cabs and horses by the day to drivers who were daily in attendance for the purpose of hiring, changing, and returning cabs and horses The horse-keepers and cab-cleaners when not at work lived with their respective families in different rooms, having sanitary conveniences situate over different portions of the premises. In the stables and stable-yard there was no accommodation in the way of sanitary conveniences for the horse-keepers and cab-cleaners employed 74 there The magistrate dismissed the complaint, holding that the stables and yard did not constitute a " workplace " within the meaning of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, section 38 (54 and 55 Vict., c. 76). The appellant being dissatisfied with this decision applied for, and the magistrate accordingly stated, a case, which set out the above facts and yesterday came on for hearing. Mr. H. Courthope-Munroe and Mr. W. H. Leese, for the appellant, con-, tended that the object of the Legislature was that factories, workshops, and places where persons are employed should be fitted with sanitary conveniences. This appeared from the Public Health Acts, 1890, section 22, and the Public Health Act, 1875, section 38. The word "work-place " was intended to have a wider meaning than factory or workshop. Counsel cited " Countess of Rothes v. Kirkcaldy Waterworks Commissioners" (7 App. Cas., 694); "Anderson v. Anderson " (1895 (1 Q.B., 749); " Attorney-General v. Mutual Tontine Association (1 Ex.D., 469). ' Mr. Macmorran, Q.C., and Mr. Ellis J. Griffith, for the respondent, contended that the persons who frequented these premises were customers and not workmen, and that the Act did not apply to this case. " Work-place " must be taken to be a place in the nature of a factory or workshop. The Court allowed the appeal. Mr. Justice Grantham, in giving judgment, said that the magistrate had found as a fact that the hirers of cabs and horses were in attendance on these premises, which were clearly a " work-place " devoted to the work of cabcleaners and horse-keepers within a confined area. The case therefore came within section 38 of the Act, and the respondent ought to have been convicted. Mr. Justice Channell concurred. If it were necessary to give to workshop a meaning similar to factory and workshop the similarity must be in relation to the objects of the Act. The stables were analogous to a factory or workshop, in so far as they held numerous persons at work permanently in a confined space. When once it was decided that the premises were a workplace, sanitary conveniences must be supplied, and it then became necessary to consider the sufficiency of those sanitary conveniences. For that purpose the needs of those in attendance on the premises had to be taken into account. The magistrate had found as a fact that the hirers of cabs were in attendance, and that being so, they were not the less so because they were customers. Domestic Workshops. Outworkers.—The Order of the Secretary of State, dated January 27th, 1896, with regard to Lists of Outworkers, made under Section 65 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, Section 27 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1891, and Section 44 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1895, requires— " The occupier of every factory and workshop (including any workshop conducted on the system of not employing any child, young person, or woman therein) in the business of which persons are employed in : The manufacture of articles of wearing apparel, The manufacture of electro-plate, 75 Cabinet and furniture making and upholstery work, The manufacture of files, Fur-pulling, And every contractor employed by any such occupier in the business of the factory or workshop, and also The occupier of every place from which any work of making wearing apparel for sale is given out, and Every contractor employed by any such occupier in connection with such work, to keep in the form and with the particulars prescribed in the schedule hereto, lists showing the names of all persons directly employed by him, either as workmen or as contractors in the business of the said factory, workshop or place, outside the factory, workshop or place, and the places where they are employed ; and every such list shall be open to inspection by any inspector under the Factory and Workshop Acts, 1878 to 1895, or by any officer of a sanitary authority; and every such occupier and contractor shall send to the inspector for the district a list of such out-workers on or before the first day of March and the first day of September in each year. This Order shall come into effect on the 1st day of April, 1898, from which date the Order of the 27th January, 1896, under section 27 of the Factory and "Workshop Act, 1891, is revoked." §6—WATER SUPPLY AND WATER SERVICE. The condition of the waters supplied by the New River and West Middlesex Water Works Companies during the year, as stated in the Reports of the Analyst of the Local Government Board and of the Chemists of the Water Companies, has been already reported in my Monthly Reports. Regulations of the Water Companies.—The Borough Council now, in 1901, exercise within the Borough, conjointly with the County Council, the powers under Sections 17 to 25 of the Metropolis Water Act, 1871. These Sections provide that every Company shall make Regulations for preventing undue consumption or contamination of water, and, under Section 26 of the Metropolis Water Act of 1852, for preventing the waste or misuse of water, and amongst other things to prescribe the size, nature and strength of the pipes, cocks, cisterns, and other apparatus to be used, and to interdict any arrangements and the use of any pipes, cocks, cisterns, or other apparatus which may tend to such waste or misuse. Any Company may repeal or alter any Regulations or make new Regulations instead. The Metropolitan Authority, the London County Council, now also the Borough Council, or any ten consumers may be requested in writing to repeal or alter any Regulation or make new instead, and upon refusal of the Local Government Board may hold Inquiry and make such Regulation, repeal, or alteration, as they think fit. Penalties of a sum not exceeding £5 may be imposed for any offence against the Regulations. Within four days after making repeal or alteration of a Regulation, notice must be served upon the Borough Council by the Company. No Regulation, repeal or alteration is valid until confirmed by the Local 76 Government Board, who may institute Inquiry if they think fit, and must hear the County Council, the Borough Council, and the Company, and the Board may then confirm or disallow any Regulation, repeal or alteration, one month's notice in writing and by advertisement having been given of the Public Inquiry. A printed copy of the Regulations must be kept at the office of the County Council, the Borough Council, and the Company for public perusal. The Regulations in force at the present time were made in 1872, but the Water Companies deposited new Regulations recently, at the commencement of 1901, and a Public Inquiry was held by the Local Government Board, when the proposed new Regulations were withdrawn. 7.—Drainage.—The following table represents the results of tests applied to drains during the year 1900 :— After Infectious Disease.

On the 29th June and the 7th November, 1900, a Conference of Representatives of the City Corporation and the Yestries and District Boards, with the General Purposes Committee of the London County Council, was held at the County Hall, on Streets and Street Traffic. At this. Conference the removal of refuse was discussed in various forms, and no doubt will be improved upon in future administration. § 9.—NUISANCES. Rag and Bone Stores.—On account of the pollution of the walls and floors of premises that often is found to take place where bones, fat, and other animal and greasy matters or greased substances are deposited, there should be power to compel the use of proper impervious receptacles upon this class of premises; and on account of the liability to cause nuisance the receptacles should have air-tight covers, and be portable, and be regularly cleansed. Bye-Laws as to Nuisances.—By Section 23 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882 (45 & 46 Vict., cap. 50), as applied by Section 16 of the Local Government Act, 1888, as applied by Schedule 2, Part II., of the London Government Act, 1899, provides that the Council may from time to time make such Bye-laws as to them seem fit for the good rule and government of the Borough and for the prevention and suppression of nuisances not already punishable in a summary manner by virtue of any Act in force throughout the Borough, and may thereby appoint such fines, not exceeding in any case five pounds, as they deem necessary for the prevention and suppression of offences against the same. Noisy Animals.—The following bye-law that may be useful in controlling the keeping of fowls was passed by the London County Council on the 19th July, 1898:— 2.—No person shall keep within any house, building, or premises any noisy animal which shall be or cause a serious nuisance to residents in the neighbourhood. Provided that no proceedings shall be taken against any person for an offence against this bye-law until after the expiration of a fortnight from the date of the service on such person of a notice alleging a nuisance, signed by not less than three householders residing within hearing of the animal. 78 § 10-SUMMONSES.

The licensed slaughterhouses, cowsheds, and dairies have been regularly inspected. The markets and market streets have been kept under regular observation and also visited on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings during the summer months. By the London Government Act, 1899, which came into force in November, 1900, section 4, it is now the duty of each Borough Council to enforce within their Borough the bye-laws and regulations (I) for the time being in force with respect to dairies and milk, and with respect to slaughterhouses, knackers' yards, and offensive businesses, and for the purpose of performing this duty the Borough Council in all cases have the same power of entry as they have in the case of slaughterhouses and knackers' yards, and if the Council make default in performing this duty, the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, apply as if the default were a default under that Act. The following are the Reports made to me by the Food Inspectors for the year 1900:— Inspectors' Office, Town Hall, January, 1900. To Dr. J, F. J. Sykes, Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I have the honour to subarit to you a return of my work in the Northern and Eastern Divisions of the Borough for the year ending December 31st, 1900:— Sale of Food and Drags Acts. I took 251 samples during the past year, which includes 19 taken in course of delivery at railway stations. In 24 instances adulteration was found to exist upon analysis as to warrant prosecutions being taken. Inspection of Market Streets. &c. There are 14 market streets in the divisions — 60 butchers' shops. 9 pork and provision dealers. 4 tripe dressers. 8 butchers' stalls. 5 rabbit „ 82 The total number of inspections of the above premises and places is 1,824. I made 14 applications to the Magistrates sitting at the various Police Courts to condemn and order to destroy the following unsound food: — 2 Sheeps' Livers. 1 Ox „ 1 Pumpkin. 13 lbs. Tomatoes. 10 lbs. Apples. 1 barrel of Oranges. 8 lbs. Cherries. 65 lbs. Pears. 40 lbs. Plums. 25 lbs. Beef. 7 lbs. Mutton. Each of the above applications were granted, with the result that in 10 instances further proceedings were taken and penalties inflicted. The following food was also destroyed, but was surrendered by the owners: — 1 bushel of Oranges. ½ truck load of Savoy Greens. 2 Ducks. 2 lbs. Tomatoes. 3 bushels of Plums. 4 tins of Salmon, &c. 19 frozen Rabbits. £ trunk of Haddocks. 1½ cwt. of Conger Eels. 1 trunk Cod Fish. 1 Fowl. 3 lbs. of Mutton. Slaughter House Inspection. There are 8 licensed private slaughter-houses in the divisions, to which I paid 266 visits ; these premises were kept in a clean condition, and the Byelaws of the London County Council carefully complied with, and it is satisfactory to note that, although these slaughter-houses are in close proximity to, in some instances abutting on to dwelling houses, no complaint was received of any smell arising therefrom. Owing to the slaughter-houses being situated at a distance from each other, and slaughtering taking place after office hours, and carried on at different establishments at the same time, it is impossible to examine every carcase after being dressed. I examined the following carcases before leaving the slaughter-houses:— Oxen. Heifers. Cows. Bulls. Calves. Sheep. Lambs. Pigs. Total. 127 2 — — 4 490 60 154 837 83 I estimate 837 to represent .09 of all animals killed for the food of man in the two divisions. I append a table showing the number of animals found to be diseased, nature of disease, and how affected. No. Description of carcase. How affected. Disease. How disposed of. 1 Ox Lungs, liver and mesentry Tuberculosis Destroyed by the owner 1 Ox Lungs " Destroyed with owner's consent 2 Oxen Liver Abscess Ditto ditto In addition to the above a number of sheeps' and pigs' livers and lungs used were affected with parasitical diseases and destroyed. Inspection of Cowsheds. I visited the 9 licensed cowsheds 209 times, and found them to be in a fair condition. I also measured up and prepared a plan and section of each cowshed, with a key plan attached showing the surrounding premises within 250 degrees. There were 25 specimens of milk taken from the cows standing in these sheds, and submitted to a bacteriological examination. I am, &c., Walter G. Auger. Town Hall, St. Pancras, January, 1901. To J. F. J. Sykes, Esq., Medical Officer of Health. Dear Sir, I beg to submit to you my report on work done since being transferred to the inspection of foods in the South and West Divisions of the Borough on May 21st, 1900. The market streets, stalls, butchers, provisions, greengrocers and fish shops have received my daily attention. During the six months I have found it necessary to take possession of foodstuffs on nine occasions which were unsound and unfit for the food of man, all of which have been dealt with in accordance with the requirements of the Law. I have procured 150 samples of food, and submitted them to the public analyst; for details see his report. 84 Under your instructions I have also procured 25 samples of milk for bacteriological examination, which were submitted to the analyst; for particulars see his report. Licensed Slaughter-houses. I have made 169 inspections of the slaughter-houses in my district, and have found the regulations strictly carried out, and the animals I have seen killed and the carcases examined after slaughter have all been of prime quality and free from any sign of disease. Con-houses. 74 Inspections of the cowhouses have been made; the bye-laws have been well observed, the cows in a healthy and cleanly state, and the premises in a sanitary condition. Food Manufacture. In my district there are ten places where sausages and poloneys, &c., are made on rather a large scale I inspect these places at irregular times and frequent periods. I have never found any tainted or diseased meat or other material used in the manufacture of those articles of food. All has been wholesome and fit for the food of man. I am, &c., J. Osborne.

The Summonses for exposure for sale of unfit food are included amongst the Summonses under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, at the end of Part IV. of the Report. Diseased Organs of Food Animals.— In the meat trade it is a common practice for slaughtering butchers to sell the offal, the price averaging in London 8 or 9 shillings. Bovine offal consists of the head, lights (or lungs), heart, liver, melt (or spleen), tripe (a first stomach), peck (a second or honeycomb stomach), runners (small intestine), and feet. All these organs or parts are used for human food, except the peck and runners. All these organs when diseased, or decomposed or stale, are often used for food for the lower animals, either in the cooked or uncooked state. All these organs, when not 86 saleable either as food for mail or for the lower animals, are sometimes used for manurial and other purposes. The slaughtering butcher commonly sells his offal to the tripe-dresser, and tripe-dressers and some butchers not only sell food for man, but also food for the domestic animals, especially cats. When is an Inspector during slaughtering in a slaughter-house justified in seizing a diseased organ that in trade terms belongs to the " offal" ? Prima facie the bovine is slaughtered for the food of man, and if the slaughterer comes across a diseased organ it is open to him to at once ask the Inspector to destroy it as trade refuse, confirming it by written request; and the Inspector should always insist upon the request being put into writing or signed for his own protection. If the slaughterer or butcher does not take this course, or intimate to the Inspector that it is not intended for the food of man, or cast it aside, the Inspector will seize it, and in order to justify his seizure and protect himself, will take the organ to a magistrate, obtain a condemnation order, and destroy it. Before a prosecution is commenced the circumstances of the case must be very carefully considered, especially whether the organ was intended for the food of man. The seizure of an organ, discovered in slaughtering, and before the butcher has hung it up, or cast it aside, or otherwise shown his intention, does not justify a prosecution. So long as tripe-dressers and butchers, &c., kill and sell food for man and for the lower animals in the same slaughterhouse on the same premises, and even in the same shop, and a different standard is allowed to prevail for the two classes of foods, so long will there be difficulty of proof. Tuberculous Food.—The Royal Commission on Tuberculosis recommended in their Report of 1898, under the head of Meat, C, Tuberculosis in Animals intended for Food, paragraph 6, that the following principles should be observed in the inspection of tuberculous carcases of cattle: (a) When the lesions are confined to the lungs j and the thoracic lymphatic glands, The Jf other_ (b) When the lesions are confined to the liver, wise healthy, shall (c) When the lesions are confined to the I not be condemned, pharyngeal lymphatic glands, but every part of it (d) When the lesions are confined to any com- containing tu^erbination of the foregoing, but are collectively sulcus lesions shall small in extent, seized. (a) When there is miliary tuberculosis of both lungs, (b) When tuberculous lesions are present on the pleura and peritoneum. II. (c) When tuberculous lesions are present in The entire carcase the muscular system, or in the lymphatic and all the organs glands, embedded in or between the may be seized, muscles, (d) When tuberculous lesions exist in any part of an emaciated carcase, 87 As fully reported in the Minutes of the late Vestry of the 16th May, 1900, the carcase of an ox was detained in a slaughter-house with a view to seizure, the following conditions having been found on slaughtering:— 1.—As to the Internal Organs. (a) Both lungs contained numerous large and small tubercular nodules and several abscesses filled with creamy pus, the lungs being very badly diseased. The thoracic lymphatic glands contained numerous tubercular nodules. (b) The liver contained numerous tubercular nodules, both large and small, mostly situated in the one half of the liver nearer the circulatory vessels and ducts. (c) The pharyngeal lymphatic glands were also affected with pronounced tuberculosis. (d) The mesenteric glands were also affected with pronounced culosis. (e) The malt or spleen presented abnormal patches on the surface. 2.—As to the Carcase. The carcase appeared well fed and healthy to the naked eye. The cervicle glands and glands near the spine, although presenting some mottling or patchiness, presented no distinct signs of tubercle to the naked eye. On account of the well fed appearance of the carcase and the objections of the owner, further opinion was sought, and as both the Veterinary Inspector of the Metropolitan Cattle Market, and the Medical Officer of Holborn District, into which the London Meat Market extends, stated that in the London Cattle and Meat Markets such a carcase would be allowed to be sold, it was released with regret. It is quite clear that there is a great gap between the minimum conditions laid down by the Royal Commission justifying only the seizure of particular organs, and the maximum condition justifying the seizure of an entire carcase, and this gap requires filling up, and the existing conditions also require amplifying. Provision is made for this contingency in the recommendation of the Royal Commission in paragraph 6 to the following effect:—" We recommend that the Local Government Board be empowered to issue instructions from time to time for the guidance of Meat Inspectors, prescribing the degree of tubercular disease which, in the opinion of the Board, should cause a carcase, or part thereof, to be seized." The Royal Commission only failed to recommend compensation in appropriate cases by a majority of one, and it is very evident that in a case such as the foregoing, the question of compensation was the stumbling block. The lute Vestry resolved to petition the Local Government Board upon the lines of the minority memorandum attached to the Report of the Royal Commission, as follows:— 88 D. Compensation for confiscation. We recommend that the owner of a carcase confiscated, and destroyed wholly or in part, by order of a Magistrate, on account of tuberculosis, shall receive full compensation and repayment of the amount paid by him for the animal, provided— (a) That the Magistrate ordering confiscation shall satisfy himself that the animal had a good appearance before slaughter, was well nourished, and exhibited no visible signs of tuberculosis. (b) That 1o compensation be paid for any animal for which there has been paid less than a minimum price, to be fixed from time to time by the Board of Agriculture, according to the market values current, nor in excess of a maximum price, to be fixed in the same manner. (c) That no sum shall be paid in compensation, except on the order of the Magistrate ordering the confiscation of the carcase. (d) That all compensation so ordered shall be charged against and paid by the Council of the administrative County, which shall be entitled to repayment of one half of the amount from Imperial Funds. It would appear desirable that there should be a power to detain food for examination when suspected of being unfit for human consumption, and that seizure should consist in a formal declaration of seizure. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF MILK. As in the previous year, fifty samples of milk were bacteriologically examined during 1900 by Mr. Walter C. C. Pakes, and the following were the results:— July 6th,1900. No. 901. No tubercle bacilli could be found. There was a slight increase in the number of leucocytes. No. 902. No tubercle bacilli could be found. The milk appeared to be quite normal. No. 903. No tubercle bacilli could be found. The milk appeared to be quite normal. No. 904. No tubercle bacilli could be found. There was a considerable increase in the number of leucocytes. No. 905. No tubercle bacilli could be found. There was a considerable increase in the leucocytes. July 10th, 1900. No. 911. No tubercle bacilli could be found. There was a slight increase in the number of leucocytes. No. 912. No tubercle bacilli could be found, but coagulation had begun to take place, so that the examination cannot be considered as conclusive. 89 No. 913. No tubercle bacilli could be found. Coagulation had begun. No. 910. No tubercle bacilli could be found. The milk appeared to be normal. No. 915. No tubercle bacilli could be found. The milk appeared to be normal. July 13th, 1900. No. 916. No tubercle bacilli could be found. The milk was normal. No. 917. No tubercle bacilli could be found, despite the fact that there is a certain quantity of pus and no sufficiency of streptococci or other organism to account for it. No. 918. No tubercle bacilli could be found. The milk was normal. No. 919. No tubercle bacilli could be found. There was an increase in the number of leucocytes. No. 920. No tubercle bacilli could be found. The milk was normal. July 17th, 1900. No. 6. No tubercle bacilli could be found. The milk contained rather more leucocytes than normal. No. 7. No tubercle bacilli could be found. There was a distinct amount of pus together with streptococci. I should consider that this evidence pointed to a simple (i.e., non-tuberculous) mastitis. No. 8. No tubercle bacilli could be found. The milk was normal with regard to leucocytes, but contained a very large number of bacteria. No. 9. Neither tubercle nor pus could be found, but there was a very large number of organisms present. No. 10. No tubercle bacilli could be found. Both pus and blood were found, and a large number of diplococci. This, I think, pointed to an acute mastitis. July 20th, 1900. No. 11. No tubercle bacilli could be found. There was a alight excess of leucocytes and a very large number of bacteria. No. 12. No tubercle bacilli could be found. There was a very large number of bacteria present, but otherwise the mils was normal. No. 13. No tubercle bacilli could be found. There was a slight excess of leucocytes, and the milk was very dirty. No. 14. No tubercle bacilli could be found. There was a small amount of pus and numerous streptococci,. and diplococci. This was, I think, evidence of a non-tuberculous mastitis. No. 15. No tubercle bacilli could be found. The milk was normal. July 24th, 1900. No. 16. No tubercle bacilli could be found. Tbe only abnormal constituent that could be found was a little blood. 90 No. 17. There were a few bacilli present in this sample which had the appearance of tubercle bacilli. There was a small amount of pus present with a considerable number of diplo-bacilli. I think that this milk shewed evidence of a mastitis. No. 18. In this specimen were found some pus and a few doubtful tuberole bacilli. There is, I think, little doubt that there was a mastitic condition of one of the quarters. No. 19. No tubercle bacilli could be found. Pus is present, and many streptococci. This was, I think, evidence of a non-tuberculous mastitis. No. 20. No tubercle bacilli could be found. The milk was normal. September 19th, 1900. No. 950. No tubercle bacilli could be found. No. 951. This sample was normal. No tubercle bacilli could be found. No. 952. This sample was normal. No tubercle bacilli could be found. No. 953.

No. tubercle bacilli could be found. The milk may be considered normal. No. 23. No tubercle bacilli could be found. The milk may be considered normal. No. 24. This sample of milk was quite normal. No tubercle bacilli could be found. September 25th, 1900. No. 25. No tubercle bacilli could be found, nor was there an excess of leucocytes. There was, however, a very large number of bacteria and oidia. No. 26. This sample contained some pus. and a considerable number of streptococci, evidence I consider of some mastitis. No tubercle bacilli "could Tie found. No. 27. This sample contained a very considerable excess of leucocytes and many streptococci, but no tubercle bacilli could be round. In addition to the streptococci were enormous numbers of other bacteria. No. 28. This sample of milk was normal as regards leucocytes, and no tubercle bacilli could be found. Very large numbers of bacteria were present. No. 29. No tubercle bacilli could be found. This milk may be considered as normal. No. 30. In this sample of milk was a considerable excess, of leucocytes and many streptococci. No tubercle bacilli could be found. 91 ADULTERATED FOOD.

Arsenic in Beer.—Towards the end of the year much sickness and a number of deaths in the north of England were traced to poison by arsenic through the medium of beer, into which it had passed with the sugar manufactured from impure sulphuric acid. A few samples in St. Pancras were submitted to analysis, and found arsenic free, and the arsenical poisoning did not extend to London. 94 VI-—LEGISLATION. During the year several Acts of great sanitary interest were passed or came into force. CENSUS (GREAT BRITAIN) ACT, 1900. 63 Vict. ch. 4. The Act for taking the Census for Great Britain in the year one thousand nine hundred and one, provided that the Local Government Board shall superintend the taking of the census. The Registrar-General shall, subject to the approval of the Board, prepare and issue such forms and instructions as he deems necessary for the taking of the census. The expenses incurred, with the approval of the Treasury, for the purposes of the census, shall be paid out of money provided by Parliament. For the purposes of the census every registration sub-district shall be divided into enumeration districts and an enumerator shall be appointed for each enumeration district. Overseers of the poor and relieving officers for poor law unions shall, if so required by the Local Government Board, act as and be enumerators for the purposes of this Act. Schedules shall be prepared by or under the direction of the Local Government Board for the purpose of being filled up by or on behalf of the several occupiers of dwelling-houses, with the following particulars, and no others, namely, particulars showing— (a) the name, sex, age, profession or occupation, condition as to marriage, relation to head of family, birth place, and (where the person was born abroad) nationality of every living person who abode in every house on the night of the census day ; and (b) whether any person who so abode was blind or deaf and dumb, or imbecile or lunatic ; and (c) where the occupier is in occupation of less than five rooms, the number of rooms occupied by him ; and (d) in the case of Wales or the county of Monmouth, whether any person who so abode (being of three years of age or upwards) speaks English only or Welsh only, or both English and Welsh. The Registrar General may, if he thinks fit, at the request and cost of the Council of any county, borough, or urban district, cause abstracts to be prepared containing statistical information with respect to the county, borough, or district, which can be derived from the census returns but is not supplied by the census report, and which, in his opinion, the Council may reasonably require. 95 LONDON GOVERNMENT ACT, 1899. This Act came into force in November, 1900, and the new Metropolitan Borough Councils had transferred to them certain additional powers and duties, some of which are of sanitary importance. By the Second Schedule, Part I., there were transferred the powers under section twenty-eight of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, of registering dairymen; subject to the power of the London County Council to make Bye-laws, and in case of default to the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, as if the default were a default under that Act. By the Second Schedule, Part II., there were transferred the powers under section seventeen to twenty-five of the Metropolis Water Act, 1871, with respect to regulations of Water Companies. The power to be exercised only with respect to a Water Company supplying any part of the Borough. Power under section seven of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1888, to make or appear in opposition to certain complaints. Power under section sixty-five of the Local Government Act, 1888, which section relates to the acquisition of land. The power to be exercised only when the land is required for the purpose of any of the powers or duties of the Borough Council. Power to adopt Part III. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. The power to be exercised only within the Borough. Power to make Bye-laws uuder section twenty-three of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, as applied by section sixteen of the Local Government Act, 1888. The Bye-laws to be in force only within the Borough, and not to be inconsistent with any Bye-laws of the County Council. Registration of Dairymen.—The Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops' Orders of 1885, 1886, and 1899 require the registration of all purveyors of milk with the Local Authority, and empower the Local Authority to enforce Regulations as to cowsheds, dairies, milkstores, milkshops, and milk-vessels. Regulations of Water Companies.—The Borough Council now exercise within the Borough, conjointly with the County Council, the powers under Sections 17 to 25 of the Metropolis Water Act, 1871. A summary of the provisions of these sections has been already set out under the head of "Water Supply." Railway and Canal Traffic.—The Railway and the Canal Commissioners are the Authority exercising jurisdiction under this Act, and appeals from the Board of Trade under the Cheap Trains Act, 1883, for the purpose of providing a sufficient service of workmen's trains are referable to the Railway and Canal Commissioners. Acquisition of Land.—Section 65 of the Local Government Act, 1888, gives power to the Borough Council to acquire, purchase, take on lease, or exchange land, and to acquire, hire, erect, and furnish halls, buildings, and offices. The compulsory purchase of land requires notices to be served and a Local Government Board Inquiry to be held. In the case of the Attorney-General v. Hanwell Urban District Council, decided in the Court of Appeal, before Lord Alverstone, Master of the Rolls, and Lords Justice Rigby and Collins, on 20th June, 1900, it was held that an Order of the Local Government Board, under Section 175 of the Public Health Act, 1875, could only authorise a local authority to retain land not required for the purpose for which it had been acquired instead of selling it, but did not extend to enable them to apply the land permanently to another purpose. (1900, W. N., 138; 35 L. J., 384; 109 L. T., 174.) Part III, Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890.—The Borough Council possesses power to adopt Part III. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, which includes power to acquire land (Section 57), to lease, appropriate, or purchase existing working class dwelling houses, and to erect or convert bnildings into dwelling houses (Sections 57-59), and to manage and regulate dwelling-houses (Sections 61-2 and Schedule VI.) belonging to the Borough Council. The limitation to the exercise of the power within the Borough is removed by the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1900 (63 & 64 Vict. cap. 59) by which it is provided that where any Council, other than a rural district Council, have adopted Part III. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, they may, for supplying the needs of their district, establish or acquire lodging houses for the working classes under that Part outside their district. Bye-laics under the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882.—By Section 23 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882 (45 & 46 Vict., cap. 50), as applied by Section 16 of the Local Government Act, 1888, as applied by Schedule 2, Part II., of the London Government Act, 1899, it is provided that— The Council may from time to time make such Bye-laws as to them seem meet for the good rule and government of the Borough and for the prevention and suppression of nuisances not already punishable in a summary manner by virtue of any Act in force throughout the Borough, and may thereby appoint such fines, not exceeding in any case five pounds, as they deem necessary for. the prevention and suppression of offences against the same. ORDER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD AS TO PLAGUE. An Order was issued by the Local Government Board, dated 19th September, 1900, making Plague a compulsorily notifiable disease under Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. DEFINITION OF "OWNER." Broadbent v. Shepherd.—This case, decided by the Lord Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Kennedy, in the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court, on the l5th November, 1900, is of the greatest importance. The Lord Chief Justice pointed out that the word "owner" was expressly defined to include a person who received the rack rent, whether on his own account or as agent or trustee, and that there was no reason why it should not include a rent collector, the object of Parliament having been to give local authorities some one who could easily be got at for the prompt abatement of a nuisance. 97 DEFINITION OF WORKPLACE. Under the head of Factories and Workshops in the earlier part of this Report, an important case (Bennett v. Harding) is quoted that goes far towards defining workplaces. Omnibus yards and cab yards come within this category. REPORTS MADE DURING THE FEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31st, 1900.
