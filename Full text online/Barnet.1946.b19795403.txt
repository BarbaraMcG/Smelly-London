With regard to the Barnet District C-as and Water Company, all the water is chlorinated, and a pathological staff is maintained. Tho water, in bulk, is examined daily and each pumping station once a week. 1,697 examinations of the water were made during the year, i.e. 188 Chemical and 1,509 Bacteriological, some of which were analysed by an independent laboratory. Of the Bacteriological samples representative of supply, the percentage of first class (i.e. B.Coli absent in 100 millilitres,) was 98.5% which is regarded as quite satisfactory. The Colne Valley Water Company exercises constant supervision and members of the staff are on duty day and night throughout the year examining samples. All the water supplied by this Company is chlorinated. The water supply is satisfactory both from the Chemical and Bacteriological aspect and the supply is considered adequate. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. The town is drained and sewered on the separate system, excepting the older portions of the district where it is a combined system. The sewage is conveyed to an Irrigation Farm of 56 acres, but before it is turned on the land it is screened and treated by means of detritus and sedimentation tanks, and throe rotary filters. Pumping is necessary for three sewers which have their outlets at a low point on the farm. A few outlying properties arc drained to cesspools, and part of Totteridge to the Finchley Borough Sewers. There arc only a few earth closets in remote parts of the district. SANITARY CONDITIONS AND WATER SUPPLY OF SCHOOLS.

CHIEF SANITARY INSPECTOR'S REPORT. Public Health Department, 10, Wood Street, BARNET. To the Chairman and Members of the Barnet Urban District Council. Mrs. Hughes and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report giving particulars of the measures carried out by my Deportment during the year 1946, in administering the Public Health, Housing and other Acts and Bye-Laws in force in the District. Owing to reduction in Staff and the winding up of Civil Defence work which the Deportment was responsible for, it has not been possible to do more than submit my report in a condensed form. With the return of Mr. J. B. Wilson, Additional Sanitary Inspector from Active Service in October, and Mr. H. W. C. Alloway earlier in the year, the Staff is now back to normal. Many properties have suffered as a result of the Blitz and a still greater number have deteriorated owing to the inability of getting essential repairs carried out during the war. Subject to the limitations imposed by availability of labour and materials in the building trades, it is hoped that the next report will show real improvement in bringing about much needed repair work, thus bringing the District back into its pre-war sanitary condition. INSPECTION OF DISTRICT. General Inspections of the District have been carried out periodically and all complaints investigated. The process of serving a preliminary or intimation notice upon the person in default, specifying the works necessary to remedy the defects, has been followed, and only if a person fails to comply with this preliminary notice, or strict legal procedure is necessary in the first instance is the matter reported to the Council for statutory action to bo taken. (3) PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1936. INFECTIOUS DISEASE - INVESTIGATIONS AND DISINFECTION.

SECTION 75. Fifty-one dustbins were provided after intimation to replace worn out receptacles, or absence of same. The provision of a proper sanitary dustbin is a very useful health measure. It also secures uniformity of receptacle and makes the task of the dustmen cleaner and easier. WATER SUPPLY. Ninety-five premises suffered burst pipes due mainly to the frosts during the year and repairs were Carried out to same. In seventeen cases the water was out off owing to wastage of water or non-payment of rates. In each case, this department was notified by the Barnet Gas and Water Company, and steps were taken which resulted in the early repair or reconnect ion of the supply FACTORIES ACT, 1957. Thirty-six inspections of factories with mechanical power and seventeen inspections of factories without mechanical power were made during the year, including bake-houses. Six notices were received from H. M. Inspector of Factories concerning twelve defects in factories, as follows:- Dirty walls and ceilings of work-rooms. 2 Sanitary accommodation insufficient, defective or dirty 7 Temperature ineffective or unsuitable 1 Washing accommodation insufficient or defective 2 These matters were all attended to and the Factory Inspector informed of the action taken as required by the Act. One certificate of adequate moans of escape in case of fire was issued by the Council under Section 34 of the Act. (0) HOUSING ACT 1936 - OVERCROWDING. As a result of the war it has boon impossible to administer the provisions of the above Act with regard to overcrowding. An effort has, however, been made to prevent any serious overcrowding. The files contain particulars of 3,632 surveys most of which were carried out prior to the war. They will, however, form a useful basis when a fresh start can be made with this important matter. APPICATIONS FOR COUNCIL HOUSES. The number of applications for Council Houses at the end of the year was 1,331 as against 1,065 in the previous year. 120 applicants were provided with houses during the year. PETROLEUM CONSOLIDATION ACT 1928. There are thirty-four persons licenced to store petroleum upon the Register; the same as last year. The Licences are for varying quantities from 18 gallons to 6,000 gallons. The total quantity of petroleum spirit which' may bo kept in the various stores is 29,628 gallons. Thirty-eight inspections ware made, but there was no serious breach of Regulations to report. One Licence was issued for storage of 100 lbs. of Carbide of Calcium. The scale of fees of Licences to store petroleum ranges from 5/for a quantity not exceeding 100 gallons, to £l for a 1,000 - 5,000 gallons. (7) A summary or the inspections carried out during the year is appended, together with a list of the repairs carried out as a result. The past year has been no less difficult than the War years in securing much needed repairs to house and other property, owing to the critical shortage of building materials and labour, but chiefly building materials, priority for which goes to the reaction of much needed new houses. Consequently, it has only been possible to enforce the execution of the most urgent repairs, still leaving in abeyance much needed work necessary to preserve the fabric. It is to be honed that such work will he possible in the not too distant future, otherwise much cottage property will rapidly deteriorate, causing the housing problem to become much more acute. I am, Yours obediently, CHARLES WILLIAM HILL, M.S.I.A. Chief Sanitary and Housing Inspector, Meet, Food and Petroleum Inspector. (8) SMMARY. SANITARY INSPECTION OF AREA.
