Duties. Art. 18. The following shall be the duties of the Medical Officer of Health in respect of the District for which he is appointed. (1.) He shall inform himself as far as practicable respecting all influences affecting or threatening to affect injuriously the public health within the District. (2.) He shall inquire into and ascertain by such means as are at his disposal the causes, origin, and distribution of diseases within the District, and ascertain to what extent the same have depended on conditions capable of removal or mitigation. (14.) He shall also make an annual report to the Sanitary Authority, up to the end of December in each year, comprising a summary of the action taken, or which he has advised the Sanitary Authority to take, during the year for preventing the spread of disease, and an account of the sanitary state of his District generally at the end of the year. The report shall also contain an account of the inquiries which he has made as to conditions injurious to health existing in the District, and of the proceedings in which he has taken part or advised under any Statute, so far as such proceedings relate to those conditions; and also an account of the supervision exercised by him, or on his advice, for sanitary purposes over places and houses that the Sanitary Authority have power to regulate, with the nature and results of any proceedings which may have been so required and taken in respect of the same during the year. The report shall also record the action taken by him, or on 2 his advice, during the year, in regard to offensive trades, to dairies, cow.sheds, and milk shops, and to factories and workshops. The report shall also contain tabular statements (on Forms to be supplied by Us, or to the like effect), of the sickness and mortality within the District, classified according to diseases, ages and localities. (15.) He shall give immediate information to Us of any outbreak of dangerous epidemic disease within the District, and shall transmit to Us a copy of each annual report and of any special report. He shall make a special report to Us of the grounds of any advice which he may give to the Sanitary Authority with a view to their requiring the closure of any school or schools, in pursuance of the Code of Regulations approved by the Education Department, and for the time being in force. (16.) At the same time that he gives information to Us of an outbreak of infectious disease or transmits to Us a copy of his annual report or of any special report, he shall give the like information or transmit a copy of such report to the County Council or County Councils of the County or Counties within which his District may be situated. It should be remembered that these reports are for the information of the Board and of the County Council as well as of the Council of the District, and that a statement of the local circumstances and a history of local sanitary questions which may seem superfluous for the latter, may often be needed by the former bodies.

The outbreak of measles reported at the end of last year was continued into the beginning of this year. There were 22 deaths. It was not found necessary to close any of the schools after the closure already reported. The deaths were in young children below school age and possibly may in some cases have been increased by the extremely cold weather and inability to buy coal for warming purposes. SCARLET FEVER. This disease has not been very prevalent this year. Small outbreaks occurred in April, May, June, August, September, November and December. These outbreaks in only one or two instances showed connection with the schools. There was a class outbreak in September at the Richmond Road School, started from an unrecognized case. The master was also ill with sore throat and one scholar who had had a sore throat without other symptoms appears to have conveyed the disease to his sisters immediately on their return from the seaside. Another outbreak was in November and December in scholars attending Bonner Hill School chiefly, but not entirely. It was found in many of the solitary cases that were notified that there was a history of visits outside the borough by train or tram to places where there was considerable incidence of this disease. A larger number of cases have been sent to hospital than has been usual, as in so many cases two families were living in one house. This practice seems to be getting more common and to replace the former custom of one family and one or two young men lodgers. This change is partly due to want of employment and partly to a rise in working class rents. Seventy.one cases were notified and there was one death in hospital after 5½ months treatment for albuminuria. DIPHTHERIA. These cases have been as a whole of a very mild type. The system of supplying the medical practitioners with diagnosis boxes, so that they can. take swabbings in suspicious 6 cases and the repayment for anti.toxin in the case of poor patients unable to pay the doctor must, I think, have had considerable influence in this happy result. The deaths occurred in cases when medical aid was not sought in time. ENTERIC FEVER. The deaths from this disease are 2 in number. One was a traveller who came home ill from South Africa, and one was only seen in advanced stage of the disease, beginning, as supposed influenza and not seeking medical aid till about the third week of the disease. Of the other six cases notified three were in young persons two of whom had opportunities of contracting the disease in other places. One came from New Maiden. One ,, ,, Wimbledon. One „ „ Molesey. DIARRHCEA AND INFANTILE MORTALITY. The infantile mortality is low, 96.8 per 1,000 births. There was absence of great heat throughout the summer with the consequence that the total deaths attributable to summer diarrhoea was only 11. ERYSIPELAS. There were 2 deaths in children under one year of age. One of these had been vaccinated, but there was no reason to suppose that vaccination caused the erysipelas, as other cases vaccinated from the same lymph were quite well, and too long a period had elapsed for the case to have been due to inoculation. The arm was not the part affected, SMALL POX AND VACCINATION. Small Pox has been absent from the country generally, but with the facilities for communication throughout the world the disease is liable to be re.introduced at any moment. The new Vaccination Act makes it much easier for careless persons to save themselves the trouble of having children vaccinated. There is much more objection to the bother of vaccination than conscientious objection to the practice, and 7 those who are in a position to grant certificates of exemption should consider well their responsibilities. Most conscientious objectors, however misguided we may consider them, are persons of cleanly habits, temperate in living, abstaining from alcohol and often believers in fanciful dietaries. It is probably true that abstainers from alcohol are less liable to contract infectious disorders; and it is also possibly true that a heavy meat diet makes people more liable to take infection, but this theory has not the same amount of scientific proof as in the case of alcohol. Those who give exemption certificates should therefore be careful not to grant them to careless persons, and those given to over indulgence in alcohol and meat.

J Desquamating when notified. 9 HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT. Notices have been served on all the owners of the houses in Asylum Road and there is some hope that the place may be put in thorough order throughout and a better condition of affairs maintained in future. Five houses in Hampden Road have also been dealt with, but the notices were not served till after the end of the year. Several of the houses in Fairfield Place have been put into good order and the owner of the rest of the property in this street is begining to put his houses in better condition. It is hoped that he will put them all in good condition and save the necessity of serving notices, etc. A water supply has been laid for the houses known as Clarke's Cottages, Fairfield, N. These are old and small cottages with which it is difficult to do much, but there has not been much illness in them, possibly because sick persons are removed to hospital or infirmary before the cases become serious. The houses known as Cambridge Square have been cleansed throughout and put in as good habitable condition as the structure and design admits. MIDWIVES. The midwives have been visited frequently and have been found to be working fairly satisfactorily. 11 has not been found necessary to make any reports on malpractices or improper behaviour of any kind. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. These have been visited as opportunity afforded. The bakehouses are all in good condition. In one or two cases it has been necessary to call attention to the necessity of lime whiting, but the houses on the whole are cleanly kept. As usual I have visited the refreshment houses and dining rooms. Many of these places are worked under difficulties, as ordinary house kitchens are made to serve for a larger amount of cooking than space permits to be done in a thoroughly satisfactory way. Still, the kitchens were all found to be clean and no conditions were found likely to prove deleterious to those who make use of these eating.houses. 10 COWSHEDS AND DAIRIES. The cowsheds have been inspected quarterly in company with the veterinary inspector who examines every cow most carefully. There are now five cow.keepers in the borough, and the animals were all found to be in good condition. The dairies are frequently inspected and all milk sellers are required to have suitable appliances for keeping the milk free from dust. SLAUGHTER.HOUSES. These houses have been inspected. The slaughtering is almost entirely confined to sheep, calves and pigs. The arrangements are satisfactory, and the aprons and leggings of the slaughter.men were in fair condition. In one case it was necessary to order lime whiting of the building. GENERAL REMARKS. The report generally is satisfactory. More might be done if it were thought advisable to go in for further improvements of a public character involving charges upon the rates in the present, but tending to improved conditions for those who may succeed us in the future. Acts of Parliament for the early notification of births and the medical inspection of school children, throw many new duties upon you. I have in previous reports written at some length on these questions, and I will only draw your notice to the urgent need of these Acts in certain aspects of economical hygienics. The birth rate of this country has been going down for many years. The decrease in the number of children per marriage has been gradually spreading from the rich to the well.to.do, thence to the middle classes, and now to the artizans and harder working members of the labouring classes. It is only in the more thriftless classes that a high birth rate still maintains, and with it in the same classes a high infantile mortality rate. Now, as the general death rate is also going down, this might be thought to equalize matters, but, unfortunately, the circumstances of factory and town life have a deleterious effect upon those members of the community who have not a strong constitution to begin with ! Infantile diseases weaken children ! Children's diseases weaken grown.ups! Trade depends firstly upon the numbers of the population, and secondly upon the physical powers and skill of each unit of the population to do his share of effective labour. Foreign countries have discovered that skill follows upon increased physical well being, and are taking steps to 11 secure the physical efficiency of their people, and we are forced to do the same for ours. The question of parental responsibility is often referred to, but, unfortunately, the classes which accept the doctrine of parental responsibility to the full are the classes in which families are getting smaller and smaller. In the classes with the largest families responsibility has never been exercised and never will be. In the past this class was much larger in proportion to the general population, but now that so many more have learnt the higher duties of citizenship, including parental responsibility, the number refusing to accept those responsibilities is rapidly increasing. Marriages take place later in life, if at all, and this prevalence of small families amongst the more thoughtful has made it imperative for the sake of trade and the defence of the empire that we should look after all the children that are born, and bring up as many as possible to be citizens of sound physique. Defect in physique leads to defect in education, and defect in education means a large class of casual labourers, who drop quickly out of employment in times of stress and degenerate into that standing menace the " unemployed." The baby must be looked after, and the infantile mortality must be reduced—128 out of every 1000 children die in this town during the first year of life. That means that 50 or 60 babies are allowed to die every year through stupidity, carelessness, and neglect which is too often wilful. At school age these children are to be inspected, and the parents informed when it is necessary that they should seek medical advice, so that diseases may not be neglected till it is too late to effect a cure. We shall have to see that eyesight, hearing, consumptive tendencies, mental conditions, etc., are so attended to that the least possible harm shall result. To show that this is not a cry founded on panic, I would submit to you the following figures:— 1865—1874 1875—1884 1885—1894 1895—1904 Latest figures Births per marriage Birth Rate, 35.4 per 1000. „ 347 .» „ 31'2 .. „ 29 27.4 „ England less than 2. Scotland more than 2. Ireland „ 2. Of 268,695 immigrants to Canada, 1903.4, only 92,702 came from the United Kingdom, whilst 94,702 came from U.S.A., and 71,927 from other countries—roughly speaking only about half were British born. At any rate, the 12 percentage of English, Scotch, and Irish in Canada has declined from 21 per cent, of the population to 19 per cent. The cause of these conditions is not climatic. French Canadians average 9.2 children per marriage—other Canadian born women 2.5 children per marriage. And it is not racial, for French women in France average 1.5 children against the British 1.9 per marriage. In Australia and New Zealand the birth rates are very low, but the infantile mortality rate is much lower than in England. Another reason for an increase in physical improvement is that the territorial army scheme is now coming into work. The military authorities are enthusiastic —the only difficulty will be to find the men. These Acts will all have far reaching effects upon the people of this country, but in addition to the necessity for providing the men for the defence of our country, you as a sanitary authority will be asked to help by giving such sanitary advice and assistance, through your officials as local authorities can give in a more efficient and more economical way than would be possible for a central staff. We know the sanitary conditions of our districts. We know where soldiers can best be quartered, where they can best obtain water and the necessary supplies, and what steps are needful to prevent military movements from interfering unduly with sanitation, and becoming an additional menace to the inhabitants in event of invasion. The officials are only too anxious to give their assistance, and it remains for you to offer such facilities as the military authorities may ask of you. The sanitary committee has recommended the adoption of the notification of Births' Act, 1897. In connection with infant feeding special cards have been issued through medical men, nurses, etc., of which specimens are here given. Borough of Kingston.upon.Thames. TO PARENTS DESIRING HEALTHY CHILDREN. Read also the card on the Feeding and Management of Babies. TO MOTHERS. Before the child is born care must be taken. Regular habits for meals, walking exercise, &c. Avoid over.eating, indigestible foods, and alcohol. Make proper preparations for the ' little stranger.' You can subscribe to a maternity 13 aid society such as Princess Charlotte's Memorial Lying.in Club, Manager, Miss Robinson, 260, Canbury Park Road. There are also similar clubs in connection with St. Luke's, St. Peter's and St. John's Churches. EYES. If the baby's eyes run with matter and look red a few days after birth take it at once to a doctor. Delay is dangerous, and one or both eyes may be destroyed if not treated immediately. WASHING BABY. Give baby a bath once a day, using tepid water and a little soap. If accustomed to it from the first, even the youngest child will enjoy it, and be improved in health by it. DRESSING BABY. The clothing should be warm, and fit loosely. There should always be flannel next to the skin. Tight bandaging, with the notion of " supporting" the body, is not only unnecessary but hurtful. Until children are able to run about, no part of the body, except the head and hands, should at any time be bare.

If you do so, the baby will suffer from pain in the stomach, with attacks of diarrhoea and sickness, and will not sleep at night. 14 3.—Do not as a rule feed the baby between 11 at night and 5 in the morning. WEANING BABY. The baby should not be weaned suddenly, but by degrees. After the seventh month bread and milk or oatmeal gruel may be given once or twice a day. Well boiled oatmeal porridge and new milk should be gradually added to the diet. FRESH AIR AND EXERCISE. Keep the windows always open at the top. In addition, air the room thoroughly twice every day by open windows and doors. Take the children out every day. SLEEP, &c. Don't accustom your baby to be rocked or nursed to sleep, or to sleep in your arms. Fresh air makes sleep more refreshing. The air cannot be fresh if the bed.clothes are dirty. Young children in bed with their parents may be injured, or even smothered, by getting wholly beneath the bed.clothes. Wakefulness means illness. The most frequent source of illness in infancy is improper feeding. During teething, when the child is irritable and restless, never use soothing syrups, sleeping draughts, laudanum or any other medicine. TO FATHERS. Before the birth of the child the mother should be relieved of all worry and anxiety. Work in factory or workshop should be forbidden. Domestic duties are sufficient. Whilst the mother is nursing her child the same rules apply. If the mother goes out to work the money earned is bound to be lost later on in sickness and weakness in the child. Alcohol is bad for mothers both before the birth of the child and during suckling. H. BEALE COLLINS, Public Health Department, Medical Officer of Health. Kingston.upon.Thames, April, 1908. 15 Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames. THE FEEDING AND MANAGEMENT OF BABIES. Do not be persuaded to give up nursing your own baby, unless this is specially ordered by a doctor—a very rare event. The best food for the baby is mother's breast milk alone without any other food whatever. Babies nursed by their mothers have nearly three times as good a prospect of reaching one year of age as babies who are hand-fed. Consider then the danger to your baby's life which is involved in not giving it breast milk during the first nine or ten months of its life. NEVER give the baby "some of what you have yourselves." It is especially dangerous to wean your baby during the summer months of June, July, August and September. Death from Diarrhœa is very common among hand-fed babies, very rare among breast-fed babies. Do not overfeed the baby—Do not feed the baby too often. FURTHER ADVICE AS TO BABIES. If the baby cannot possibly be breast-fed, please note the following important points NEVER give the baby bread or sops or gravy, or any food except milk, until it is more than seven months old. NEVER use a feeding bottle with a long tube. NEVER use a dummy teat or "comforter." Dirt is the great danger to the baby's health. Comforters are always getting dirty, and a long-tubed feeding bottle cannot be kept properly clean. NEVER give the baby soothing syrups, or teething powders, or anything of the sort. THE PREVENTION OF RICKETS. Rickets is a very serious disease of childhood, not only because it causes "bandy legs" and other deformities; but also because it helps to produce dangerous chest diseases, like bronchitis and pneumonia; and increases the number of deaths occurring during attacks of measles and whooping cough. Rickets is one of the main causes of disease and death in the first five years of life. It is very rare in breast-fed babies. 16 It is common in hand-fed babies; particularly in babies fed on patent foods or condensed milk, instead of on new milk. The fault in the diet which chiefly casues it is too little fat in the food. There is not enough fat to nourish the baby either in sweetened condensed milk or in patent babies' foods. Fresh cow's milk is better than either of these, but must be suitably diluted. Even fresh cow's milk usually needs a little cream to be added to be added to each bottle. Half to one teaspoonful of cod liver oil twice a day is an excellent means of preventing rickets. FOR CHILDREN OVER ONE YEAR OF AGE. Fat is still an important means of preventing rickets. Butter, or if this cannot be afforded, margarine or dripping with bread, is a better food than bread and jam. Nothing can satisfactorily take the place of milk in children's food. Milk and bread with butter or dripping or margarine is a complete dietary for children, especially if porridge is also given each day; and with such food, meat, which is more expensive, need not be given.
