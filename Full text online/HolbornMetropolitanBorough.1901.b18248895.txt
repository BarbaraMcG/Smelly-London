I visited the case with the Doctor, and was of the opinion that it was a severe case of Chicken-pox. As another Doctor also considered it was Small-pox, I advised that a Consultant should be called in. He also thought it was Small-pox, and the patient was removed to the South Wharf at Rotherhithe, but returned the same day certified not to be suffering from Small-pox. The patient's brother, a medical student who visited him during his illness, also contracted Chicken-pox. The first case of Small-pox was C. S., male, 50 years of age, a rent collector of 21, Portpool Lane, a registered tenement house. He probably contracted the disease at a working man's club near the Holborn Town Hall. He was taken ill on the 9th August, the rash appeared on the 11th, notified on the 13th, and removed to hospital the same evening. The rooms and their contents were thoroughly disinfected, the patient's wife and family were re-vaccinated and were removed to 191, High Holborn, a vacant house the property of the Council, some of the rooms of which were prepared and furnished for the occasion. Only 20 of the 56 inhabitants of the house could be persuaded to be re-vaccinated. A second case (an Italian woman) occurred in the same house (not the same family) about a fortnight later, but was not notified until the sixth day of the rash. No other case was notified from this house. After the first case and prior to the second case at 21, Portpool Lane, the five successive cases notified all occurred at a distance from this house, and in the western half of the Borough, and were all scattered cases, and probably contracted from persons living outside the Borough. A cause of much of the spread of the disease in the Borough was a woman of the unfortunate class who slept at common lodging houses, and was visiting public houses in the Borough for about a week with the eruption on her. I saw her in the street with another woman of the same class near the Relief Offices, Endell Street, and prevailed upon her to see a doctor there. She was notified and detained, but, unfortunately, escaped before the ambulance arrived, and was not again found and removed to hospital until after midnight more than two days after her escape. Delay in notification either on account of neglect in calling in a Doctor, or on account of difficulty of diagnosis, has been another great cause of spread of the disease. In one house, 48, Great Wild Street, a tenement house which contained 28 persons, 12 contracted Small-pox and of these ten most probably contracted it from a youth who had not been attended by a Doctor, and a younger brother who had the eruption out for six or seven days before a Doctor was called in. The eleven persons had all refused re-vaccination after the first case. These two youths also infected at least 8 or 9 relatives and friends who lived in the neighbourhood and had visited them at this house. Of the 193 genuine cases to the week ending December 28th, 1901,42 occurred at the following Common Lodging Houses:— 22-25, Queen Street (men) 13 8-10, Parker Street (women) 6 4, Greville Street (men) 5 Fulwood's Rents (men) 4 „ „ (women) 3 16, Castle Street (men) 3 Kennedy Court (women) 2 Parker Street Municipal (men) 2 Salvation Army Shelter, Charles Street (men) 2 11, Short's Gardens (men) 1 6, Betterton Street (men) 1 Total 42 14 PREVENTIVE MEASURES. The preventive measures which were adopted, may he arranged under the following headings:— 1. Vaccination and re-Vaccination. 2. Early diagnosis of the disease. 3. Prompt removal of the patient to Small-pox Hospital. 4. Disinfection. 5. Temporary shelter or house accommodation for persons during the disinfection of their rooms. 6. Visits to infected houses day by day for a fortnight, so that any person who is ill can be medically examined, in order to ascertain whether the person has contracted Small-pox. 7. Information to the respective Medical Officers of Health of the Districts in which contacts with the0 patient reside or work. 1.—Vaccination and Re-vaccination. The most effective measure for the prevention of Small-pox is Vaccination and Re-vaccination. It is most anomalous that the control of vaccination should be in the hands of Boards of Guardians, and this Council agreed that this control should be transferred to the Sanitary Authorities. I at once advised that prompt measures should be taken to secure efficient vaccination and re-vaccination throughout the Borough. I wrote to the Boards of Guardians of St. Giles and Bloomsbury and of Holborn, suggesting that they should give directions for a house-to-house visitation in order to endeavour to secure this. I also saw the clerks and vaccination officers of these Boards. I alluded to the results of the inspection of the arms of children attending Voluntary Schools in the Borough of Marylebone, and suggested that the Council should endeavour to secure this in the Board and Voluntary Schools throughout the Borough. The Board of Guardians of St. Giles and Bloomsbury very promptly took action. The Board had placards respecting Small-pox and Vaccination posted throughout the Parishes and similar hand-bills distributed in the house-to-house visitation; also the leaflets of the Jenner bociety on the subject of Vaccination and Sanitation. An assistant Vaccination Officer was also appointed to assist in the house-to-house visitation. By the 24th December, 1901, every house, tenement, common lodging-house, factory, laundry, etc., had been visited, 13,000 hand-bills and 3,000 Jenner leaflets had been distributed. The number of Vaccinations performed by the Public Vaccinator, Dr. Hallen, up to the 30th December, 1901, was:— Primary Vaccinations 469 Re-Vaccinations 1,714 Total 2,183 Including these the totals to the 25th March, 1902, were:— Primary Vaccinations 626 Re-Vaccinations 4,907 Total 5,533 15 The following are the details of the examination of the arms of children attending schools in the Parishes of St. Giles and Bloomsbury:— SCHOOL. Number in Attendance. Number of Objectors. Number Examined. Number Vaccinated. Number Doubtful. Number Unvaccinated. Endell Street National 529 - 529 433 - 96 Christ Church do 295 87 208 173 9 26 Drury Lane Industrial 129 21 108 83 - 25 Tower Street Board 351 94 257 191 - 66 Great Wild Street Board 751 61 690 542 41 107 Galen Place National 354 - 354 302 - 52 Macklin Street Catholic 239 - 239 134 - 105 Gate Street Catholic 272 — 272 181 — 91* Total 2,920 263 2,657 2,039 50 568 * Including 46 who had been only recently vaccinated through house-to-house visitation. At the last school in the list, the examination was not made until the 9th January, 1902, as the Managers of the School at first refused to allow this to be done. The percentage of children found to be unvaccinated was 21.4. Of the 568 children found unvaccinated, 398 have been successfully vaccinated. 155 reside in other parishes, and notices were posted to the Vaccination Officer of the District in which they resided. 4 have died. 8 have gone away. 2 have been postponed by Medical Certificate. 1 is insusceptible. In the Holborn Sub-Division of the Holborn Union much vaccination and re-vaccination was also carried out. House-to-house visitation, in proximity to the cases of Small-pox notified, was made by the Vaccination Officer. From August, 1901, to the end of March, 1902, the number of vaccinations by the Public Vaccinator, Dr. Gabe, was as follows:— Primary Vaccinations 2,166 Re-Vaccinations 5,263 Total 7 429 In addition to these, many large firms have had their employees vaccinated at private expense, and many of the residents have been vaccinated or re-vaccinated by their own doctors during the present outbreak, so that a large proportion of the population is fully protected against Small-pox, and thus prevents spread of the disease. The Vaccination Officer of this Division of the Borough also informs me that, as a result of the examination of the arms of children at the Board and Voluntary Schools, about one-third refused examination; about one-third were vaccinated; about one-third were not vaccinated. He found that most of the children who were not examined had been vaccinated, the parents objecting to the examination on the ground of a false idea of re-vaccination being made compulsory. As a result of this examination fully 1,000 children were primarily vaccinated and more than 1,000 were re-vaccinated. RE-VACCINATION OF THE COUNCIL'S EMPLOYEES. At the beginning of the outbreak I was again re-vaccinated, and advised the staff of the Public Health Department to be re-vaccinated, pointing out that cases of small-pox had occurred amongst the Sanitary Inspectors and Disinfecting Staff of other boroughs. All the Sanitary Inspectors were re-vaccinated (except the one who had been successfully re-vaccinated 18 months previously) also the two Clerks of this department, and all have escaped small-pox. 16 On account of the great increase of disinfections required, fresh men were employed who had not been re-vaccinated, and 6ix of these men contracted small-pox, one of whom was re-vaccinated too late, five days after he had begun this work, and after he had contracted small-pox. No case occurred amongst any of the Disinfecting Staff after having been re-vaccinated twelve days, nor has any other employee of the Council contracted small-pox. The Town Clerk was also re-vaccinated and the majority of the staff of his and of the other departments. THE GREAT IMPORTANCE AND VALUE OF SUCCESSFUL VACCINATION AND RE-VACCINATION. The present outbreak of Smallpox has again demonstrated the very great importance and value of successful vaccination and re-vaccination. The Registrar-General has published statistics of the 1,015 deaths from Small-pox of London residents which have been registered from the beginning of the outbreak to the 5th of April, 1902. Of these there has been no death of a person who had been re-vaccinated within the previous ten years, and but one death of a vaccinated child under ten years of age, and this child was certified to have been but imperfectly vaccinated. On the other hand, there were 264 deaths of un-vaccinated children under ten years of age, including 38 deaths of children under ten who were not vaccinated until after they had contracted Small-pox. In the Holborn Borough, I estimate that at least 16,000 persons have been vaccinated or re-vaccinated during the present outbreak, and allowing the usual twelve days for protective incubation, not one of them has contracted Small-pox. The special report dated the 10th January, 1902, of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, stated that during the past year a very large number of new staff have joined the Ships and the Gore Farm Hospital, but not one case of Small-pox has occurred. Not one of the staff of the Hospital Ships has ever died of Small-pox. Similar evidence was afforded by the severe epidemic of small-pox in 1870-1872. The Special Committee appointed by the Managers to collate statistics of this epidemic reported as follows :— "The necessity of re-vaccination, when the protective power of the primary vaccination has to a great extent passed away, cannot be too strongly urged. No greater argument to prove the efficacy of this precaution can be adduced than the fact that out of upwards of 14,800 cases received at the hospitals only four well-authenticated cases were treated in which re-vaccination had been properly performed, and these were light attacks. Further conclusive evidence is afforded by the facts that all the nurses and servants of the hospitals, to the number at one time of upwards of 300, who are hourly brought into intimate contact with the disease, who constantly breathe its atmosphere, and than whom none can be more exposed to its contagion, have, with but few exceptions, enjoyed complete immunity from its attacks. These exceptions were cases of nurses or servants, whose re-vaccination in the pressure of the epidemic was overlooked, and who speedily took the disease, and one case was that of a nurse who, having had small-pox previously, was not re-vaccinated, and took the disease a second time." From the Report and voluminous Appendices of the Report of the Royal Commission on Vaccination I prepared the following table, giving statistics of the incidence, number of deaths and death-rates amongst the vaccinated and unvaccinated under ten years of age in the large towns in which detailed enquiry was made. The figures for London are obtained from the Annual Reports of the Metropolitan Asylums Board for the ten years 1891 to 1900. 17 STATISTICS OF THE FOLLOWING LARGE TOWNS Total number of cases of Small-pox. Under Ten Years of Age. Vaccinated. Unvaccinated. No. Number of Deaths. Death Rate. No. Number of Deaths. Death Rate. London,1891-1900 5,166 125 - - 672 153 22.8 Leicester, 1892-1893 357 2 - - 107 15 14.0 Sheffield, 1887-1888 4,703 353 6 1.7 228 100 43.9 Dewsbury Union, 1891-1892 1,029 44 1 2.2 174 56 32.1 Warrington, 1892-1893 667 33 2 6.0 32 12 37.5 Gloucester, 1895-1896 1,979 26 1 3.8 680 279 41.0 Manchester, 1892-1893 805 11 - - 36 7 19.4 Oldham, 1892-1893 124 3 - - 15 5 33.3 Leeds, 1892-1893 200 4 - - 8 3 37.5 Halifax, 1892-1893 330 4 - - 38 15 39.5 Bradford, 1893 658 17 - - 57 23 40.3 Total 16,018 622 10 1.6 2,047 668 32.6 Note.—The vaccinated include all cases that had any evidence of vaccination, however imperfect. A further conclusive proof of the life-saving power of vaccination is the great change in the age incidence of the disease. Before vaccination was introduced, the number of deaths of children under ten years of age was enormous, and greater than the total number of deaths of persons of all other ages. Now the deaths of children under ten years of age is but a small percentage of the total deaths from small-pox, and practically include only children that had not been vaccinated. (2) Early Diagnosis of the Disease. The early diagnosis of the disease is of great importance, as if the patient is removed to Hospital the first day of the rash, and all contacts at once re-vaccinated and disinfection carried out, the disease will not spread. It is well known that there is great difficulty in the diagnosis of many cases of Small-pox. I was asked by Medical Practitioners to see very many cases of Small-pox, Chicken-pox and suspicious cases before the notifications were made. The Council adopted the notification of Chicken-pox, and one of the early cases notified, I found on examination, was a case of Small-pox. The Metropolitan Asylum Board kindly made arrangements for Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health to visit the South Wharf and Small-pox Ships. I gladly availed myself of the opportunity. Arrangements ought to be made for all medical students to see cases of Small-pox. (3) Prompt Removal of the Patient to Hospital. This service is admirably carried out by the Metropolitan Asylums Board. On receipt of a message by telephone or telegram, an ambulance with a driver, porter and nurse is at once despatched at any time during the day or night. I was generally on duty long after office hours; and at the beginning of the present year the Public Health Committee consented to an Inspector being on duty till 10 p.m., and on Sundays till 1 P.m., and Dr. Watkins-Pitchford was appointed to assist me. He was on duty after office hours, and he and I took Sunday duty alternately. (4) Disinfection. All infected rooms and articles were thoroughly disinfected, all bedding, clothing, linen, etc., being removed from the house and disinfected in the Council's steam disinfector. Additional men were furnished by the Borough Surveyor as the outbreak increased. Shafts were added to the disinfecting trucks, and a pony was employed to draw them. 18 All rooms were also stripped and limewhited by the Surveyor's Department. In common lodging houses this was done the same day that the patient was removed, even if this took place after office hours, the men being at work sometimes till after midnight. (5) Temporary Shelter or House Accommodation for Persons during the Disinfection of their Rooms. As soon as the first case of Small-pox was notified an empty house, 191, High Holborn, belonging to the Council was prepared and furnished as a shelter for persons during the disinfection of their rooms. The family of the first case remained there for a fortnight, but the families generally only remained at the shelter until the disinfection and stripping of the rooms was completed. At first, food for the families was supplied by the St. Giles and Bloomsbury Guardian Board. As soon as the Council had the opinion of the Local Government Board, dated the 22nd February, 1902, that it is competent to a Metropolitan Borough Council to supply the necessary food to any inmate of a temporary shelter provided by them, the Council did this instead of the Guardian Board. To the week ending the 28th December, 1901, the number of inmates was 111, of these 96 belonged to Bloomsbury and St. Giles, and 15 to the Holborn Sub-Division. (6) Visits to Infected Houses Day by Day for a Fortnight so that any Person who is ill can be Medically Examined in order to ascertain whether the Person has contracted Small-pox. (7) Information to the respective Medical Officers of Health of the Districts in which Contacts with the Patient reside or work. During the last three months of the year the work of carrying out these various preventative measures occupied much of the time of the Public Health Department. Visits were also made on the 17th day after the removal of a patient suffering from small-pox as an additional precaution. CONFERENCE ON SMALL POX. A Conference of Representatives of the Sanitary Authorities of the Metropolis, convened by the Metropolitan Borough of Holborn, was held on the 7th February, at the offices of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, on the Embankment, for the purpose of considering whether the measures at present adopted in dealing with outbreaks of Small-pox can be in any way improved. Mr. R. M. Hensley, Chairman of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, welcomed the delegates. He reminded them of some of the figures contained in the report presented at a recent meeting of the Metroplitan Asylums Board as proving the value of vaccination and re-vaccination. Professor W. R. Smith was elected to the chair and Mr. Henry C. Jones, Town Clerk of the Metropolitan Borough of Holborn, was appointed Clerk to the Conference and various resolutions were afterwards proposed. After considerable discussion the following resolutions, submitted on behalf of the Borough of Holborn, were agreed to:— (a) That, in the opinion of the Conference, the powers and duties at present vested in Guardians of the Poor, with regard to vaccination and re-vaccination, should be transferred to, and enforced by, Borough Councils. (b) That, in the opinion of the Conference, an amendment of the law is necessary, to ensure compulsory vaccination and re-vaccination of all persons (who have not been vaccinated within five years) in a dwelling house wherein Small-pox has broken out. 19 (c) That, in the opinion of the Conference, it should be declared an offence, under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to refuse or withhold information, or give false information, with respect to persons living in a house in which small-pox has broken out, with regard to (a) their names, (b) employment or occupation, (c) schools attended by their children, or (D) as to any persons not living in such house, but employed therein. (d) That, in the opinion of the Conference, the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with regard to the prevention of infectious diseases, require amendment by (a) shortening the period of twenty-four hours, allowed by Section 60, for the master of a house to decide whether he will undertake the disinfection or allow the Sanitary Authority to do so; and (b) extending the provisions of Section 64 to the taking of any house, or part of a house, by a person suffering from an infectious disease, or who has been exposed to infection. (e) That, in the opinion of the Conference, all disinfections should be carried out by the Sanitary Authority. It was further resolved:— (f) That, in the opinion of the Conference, it is advisable that application be made to the Metropolitan Asylums Board to send out, to every Medical Officer of Health in London, daily lists of small-pox cases only, with age and addresses of patients, as is done weekly in the case of all infectious diseases. Upon consideration of a letter addressed by the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras, to the President of the Local Government Board, with regard to the steps to be taken to prevent the spread of small-pox by contact, the following resolution was passed:— (g) That in the opinion of the Conference it is desirable to amend the law by providing that when a person inhabits any part of a house in which there have been cases of small-pox, and knowingly associates with other persons without having his own person and clothes disinfected and cleansed to the satisfaction of the Local Sanitary Authority, he should be liable to a penalty not exceeding £20. On consideration of a communication addressed by the Town Clerk of the Royal Borough of Kensington to the Local Government Board, requesting them to undertake the supply of lymph to any registered Medical Practitioner, who may apply for the same, instead of to Public Vaccinators only, the Conference unanimously approved the suggestion. MEASLES. Of the 22 deaths from Measles during the year, 21 were under 5 years of age. Nine of the deaths belonged to Bloomsbury and St. Giles, and 13 to the Holborn Sub-Division. Closure of St. George-the-Martyr Infant Schools. During May, 1901, there was great prevalence of Measles amongst children attending the infant department of St. George-the-Martyr Schools. On the 21st May, only 100 out of a roll of 259 were present, most of them being absent on account of Measles. The Chairman of the Managers, the Rev. E. C. Bedford, at once agreed to the closure of the School until Monday, June 17th. The formal order for closure was signed by the Chairman of the Public Health Committee and another Member of the Committee. At the opening of the Infant School very few children were absent on account of Measles. The Head Teacher very courteously supplied me with detailed information. The Town Clerk was instructed to communicate with the Managers of all Voluntary Schools, requesting them to kindly forward to me lists of all children that were absent or excluded on account of Measles. 20 SCARLET FEVER. During the fifty-two weeks ending Saturday, the 28th December, 1901, the number of Scarlet Fever notifications, excluding duplicates, was 254; 150 in Bloomsbury and St. Giles, and 104 in the Holborn Sub-Division. Of these 238 were removed to hospital, 141 from Bloomsbury and St. Giles and 97 from the Holborn Sub-Division. There were only 3 deaths, 1 belonging to Bloomsbury and St. Giles, and 2 to the Holborn Sub-District. The greatest incidence of the disease was during the four weeks prior to the closure of the schools for the summer holidays when 48 cases were notified. During the holidays scarlet fever much diminished and during the four weeks ending August 31st, only 17 notifications were received. During the period of greatest incidence the schools most affected were Tower Street and St. George's, Bloomsbury. DIPHTHERIA. The number of cases of Diphtheria notified was 161, of which 60 belonged to Bloomsbury and St. Giles, and 101 to the Holborn Sub-District, 56 of the former and 96 of the latter were removed to hospital There was also a case of Membranous Croup notified in Bloomsbury and removed to hospital. There were 14 deaths from this disease, 6 belonging to Bloomsbury and St. Giles, and 8 to the Holborn Sub-District. The mortality was only 8.7 per cent. The disease was most prevalent during the months August to October inclusive. ENTERIC FEVER. Only 39 cases were notified, of which 17 belonged to Bloomsbury and St. Giles, and 22 to the Holborn Sub-District. Of these 12 died, 7 belonging to the former District and 5 to the latter. The mortality was high, being 30.8 per cent. The disease was most prevalent in July and August, 8 cases being notified each of these months; during the second quarter of the year only one case was notified. One patient who died, contracted the disease by visiting a family at Harringay, where the mother and five children were suffering from the disease. WHOOPING COUGH. The number of deaths from Whooping Cough was much less than last year, there having been only 4 deaths in Bloomsbury and St. Giles from the disease, and 6 in the Holborn Sub-Division, in comparison with 13 and 10 respectively in the year 1900. DIARRHœA. The number of deaths assigned to Diarrhœa (including some deaths of young children in the summer months certified as Gastro-Enteritis) was 42; 18 belonging to Bloomsbury and St. Giles, and 24 to the Holborn Sub-District. There were also 5 deaths from Enteritis. Last May a copy of the following Memorandum on Certification of "Diarrhœa" deaths, which was prepared by the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health, was sent to each of the Registered Medical Practitioners in the Borough. Memorandum on Certification of "Diarrhœa" Death. "Much confusion having arisen from the numerous synonyms, unauthorised by the Royal College of Physicians, which for some years past have been increasingly used in the certification of 21 deaths from 'diarrhœa' —the 'epidemic diarrhœa' of the Nomenclature of Diseases—the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health is desirous of calling the attention of all medical practitioners to a decision which has been arrived at by that College authorizing the use of the term 'epidemic enteritis' (or, if preferred by the practitioner, 'zymotic enteritis') as a synonym for epidemic diarrhœa (Nomenclature of Diseases, p. 9, ed. 1896); and urging the entire disuse, as synonyms of epidemic diarrhœa in medical certificates of death, of such terms as 'gastro-enteritis,' 'muco-enteritis,' 'gastric catarrh,' etc. "The confusion arising from the present practice in certification so seriously vitiates the accuracy of all statistics with regard to this disease, which is recognised by the Royal College of Physicians to be a general disease of specific character in the same sense as enteric and other fevers, that this Society desires to strongly urge medical men to strictly adhere to these authoritative decisions which the College has now published. "In future the only authorized names to be used in certifying deaths from this disease are: epidemic enteritis, zymotic enteritis, or epidemic diarrhœa, and all other synonyms are to be entirely discarded. "The late Dr. Ballard showed that this specific disease occurs in persons of all ages, and that it may happen in other than epidemic seasons, under which circumstances the Society would suggest the advisability of the employment of the alternative term, zymotic enteritis." CHICKEN-POX. On the 9th October, 1901, the Council unanimously agreed to the notification of chicken-pox, which came into force a week after the advertisement, on the 12th October. From this date 48 cases were notified, 20 in Bloomsbury and St. Giles, and 28 in the Holborn Sub-district. One of the first cases notified, I found on examination to be a case of Small-pox. Another case of Small-pox was notified in December as chicken-pox. One case that was not notified at all, I discovered to be suffering from small-pox, on account of a case of small-pox afterwards occurring in the same family. A relative living in the same house also contracted small-pox from the boy who was thought to be suffering from chicken-pox. A girl 4 years of age who was notified as suffering from Small-pox, I found on examination to have chicken-pox, and was not removed to hospital. Medical practitioners asked me to see many doubtful cases of small-pox or chicken-pox before they notified them. I prepared the following:— Report on the Notification of Chicken-pox. I suggested to the Chairman of the Public Health Committee (Professor W. R. Smith, M.D., etc.) that chicken-pox should be made a notifiable disease. I am glad that he at once gave notice of motion that such should be the case for a period of six months from the 9th October. Many outbreaks of Small-pox have been caused by a case of that disease not being diagnosed or recognised as such. The disease for which small-pox is most often mistaken is chicken-pox, and vice versa. On account of the great difficulties of diagnosis in many cases, the Metropolitan Asylums Board, "on the 17th July, 1893, opened the shelters at the South Wharf for the detention, until such "time as the accuracy of the original diagnosis could either be confirmed or disproved, of cases as to "which the Board's Medical Officer on the spot was in doubt." In the seven following years, 1894-1900, inclusive of 2,852 cases examined at the Wharf, 479 cases or 16.8 per cent. were considered not to be Small-pox, and of these 479 in more than 260, that is more than 54 per cent., the Board's expert was in doubt and they were detained at the Shelters until a diagnosis could be made. Also more than 100 of the cases of Small-pox were so detained at the Shelters before being sent to the Hospital Ships. 22 It must also be remembered that many cases are kept at home, under the observation of the doctor for a week or more, before a diagnosis of Small-pox is made. This delay as in several of our recent cases has been the cause of the spread of the disease to other members of the household and probably to other persons as well. These facts show that in many cases it is impossible to diagnose Small-pox at the first examination. The Medical Superintendent of the Hospital Ships, Dr. Ricketts, in his report for last year, 1900, states that all cases which may possibly be Small-pox ought to be at once notified and removed to the Shelters until a definite diagnosis can be made. Under existing conditions I quite agree with him, but think that if the Board were to appoint an expert or experts to visit suspected cases at their own homes, as was arranged for plague, the removal of many patients to the Shelters would be prevented. Although no part of my duty, I have always willingly examined with the doctor cases of small-pox or suspected cases, and have advised the removal at once of all cases that I thought were probably small-pox to the Shelters for definite diagnosis. About a month ago I called on the Chairman of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and informed him that I thought it desirable that the Board should make it known that they would accept the notification of suspected cases, and would remove them to their shelters, and suggested that increased accommodation for such cases should be provided at the Wharf or elsewhere. I also suggested to him that an expert should be provided for the prompt examination of suspected or doubtful cases at their own homes, as doctors generally are afraid to notify such cases as small-pox, lest they should be returned home as not small-pox. The notification of chicken-pox has already been adopted by the St. Pancras Council, and by the City Corporation for the Port of London. PLAGUE. No notification of Plague has been received. As stated in my last Annual Report, in accordance with the regulations of the Local Government Board, dated the 19th September, 1900, Plague was made a notifiable disease, and a printed circular was at once prepared and sent to each medical practitioner practising in the District giving information of this. If any case of Plague occurs on a vessel, the Port Medical Officer of Health on its arrival sends the names of the passengers and the addresses to which they are proceeding to the respective Medical Officers of Health. Information of 20 such passengers was received by me last year. They were each visited, and 17 were found to be in good health ; the remaining three went to other addresses as the hotels were full, and no further information was received. DISINFECTIONS During the 52 weeks ending December 28th, 1901. DISTRICT. Rooms. Bedding, &c. No. of Articles. Number of Persons using Refuge. Bloomsbury and St. Giles 406 11,455 96 Holborn 276 4,307 15 Total 682 15,762 111 23 PHTHISIS OR CONSUMPTION. The number of deaths from Phthisis during the year was 169, equivalent to a death-rate of 2.86 per 1,000. Of these 96 belonged to Bloomsbury and St. Giles, or a death rate of 3'07 per 1,000 and 73 to the Holborn Sub-district or a rate of 2.62 per 1,000. The corresponding rate for London was 1.66. In March, 1901, I made the following Report on the PREVENTION OF CONSUMPTION. Although Sanitary improvements have already done much, there are still about 60,000 deaths annually in England and Wales from Consumption and other forms of tuberculosis. In London there were in 1899, 8,510 deaths from Consumption alone. The corrected annual average of the preceding ten years was 8,453, or rather less. It has been estimated that in any year there are five times as many persons as the deaths that are suffering from the disease. It is known that this terrible waste of life with all the protracted suffering attending it, and the distress, moral and material which it involves, is in great measure preventable. Years ago Farr gave £156 as the average value of each human life in England. The value in London is now probably more than £200. Taking it at this figure, the loss to London during the past ten years by deaths from all forms of tuberculosis may be estimated at more than £20,000,000 (twenty million pounds). In addition therefore to humanitarian reasons there are powerful financial and economic reasons for its prevention. VOLUNTARY NOTIFICATION. In order that preventive measures may be carried out by the Council in individual cases, the Council must have information of their existence. Voluntary notification was begun in the City of New York, March 1st, 1894, and in January, 1897, the notification was made compulsory. In New York the following numbers of cases of consumption were notified voluntarily :— In 1894 4,166 cases. In 1895 5,824 cases. In 1896 8,334 cases. So that the system cannot be said to be impracticable or unsuccessful. In England it has only recently been adopted in a few towns. In Manchester, Brighton and Sheffield it has been attended with successful results. It has also been recently adopted in the adjoining Borough of Einsbury. I have information of sixteen towns in England where voluntary notification is now practised, but in about half of them only within the past twelve months. In those towns in which no fees have been allowed, it has naturally not been a success. I therefore think that it is desirable for your Council to adopt this system of voluntary notification and the same fees paid as for notifiable diseases. DISINFECTION OF ROOMS. Many experiments have proved that the dust of rooms in which a consumptive person has been living is generally infected with the germs of tuberculosis. Booms occupied by consumptives ought therefore to be cleansed at least once a week by using wet dusters and wet tea leaves or sawdust. When the consumptive removes to a sanatorium, hospital, or other premises, or dies, the room ought to be thoroughly disinfected as after other infectious diseases. 24 SANATORIA. Proper Sanatoria for the open air treatment of Consumption ought to be provided by the Boards of Guardians, instead of sending consumptives as at present to the general infirmaries. At a meeting of the representatives of the Metropolitan Guardian Boards at St. Martin's Town Hall last year, this subject was discussed and agreed to and referred to the Local Government Board, with a view to the necessary steps being taken by that Board for the carrying out of the proposal. This Council as Sanitary Authority might assist by writing to the Guardian Boards of the Borough and the Local Government Board, advocating the above proposal. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF SPUTUM. As the sputum or expectoration of consumptives often contains large numbers of the germs of tuberculosis, before a certain diagnosis can be made by other methods of examination, and prevention and cure can be more successfully carried out in the early stages of the disease, it is desirable that the Medical practitioners of the Borough should have facilities for this bacteriological examination given them by the Council. I have on previous occasions referred to the general Sanitary measures that assist in the prevention of consumption. LEAFLET. The following leaflet which was approved by the Public Health Committee, was distributed in the Borough. Consumption is an infectious and preventable disease. Thousands die annually. It is spread chiefly by inhaling the spittle of Consumptives which has been allowed to dry and float in the air as dust. The spittle contains the germs which cause the disease. Consumptives should spit into a cup or pocket spittoon containing a little water, or into pieces of paper that can be at once burnt. The spittle in the cup or spittoon must, at least daily, be burnt or washed into the drain, and the cup or spittoon thoroughly cleansed in boiling water. For wiping the mouth a piece of rag or paper should be used instead of a handkerchief, and afterwards burnt. If handkerchiefs are used they should be put into boiling water or into a disinfectant before they have time to become dry. Disinfect in the same way all soiled linen. The following is a cheap disinfectant that may be used:—¼b. of Chloride of Lime, well stirred into a gallon of water. Consumptives should not swallow their spittle. Recover}' from Consumption is not uncommon, with plenty of fresh air and good food. Intemperance tends to aggravate the disease. Patients in crowded rooms should be removed if possible to a suitable Institution or a Country Home. The Patient should sleep with the window open, with a screen to prevent draught. Thoroughly cleanse every week the floor, furniture, and room. Do not stir up the dust, but use wet dusters and wet tea-leaves or sawdust. Afterwards boil the dusters and burn the tea-leaves or sawdust. Consumptives should have separate beds and ought not to sleep in rooms with healthy persons, and should not kiss or be kissed on the mouth. All meat should be boiled, and meat well cooked. 25 On removal or death give notice to the Public Health Department, as the room and its contents should be thoroughly disinfected—this is done by the Council free of cost. The Medical Officer cf Health will be glad to have information of any case of Consumption, and, with the consent of the doctor in attendance, to give any advice or assistance. As the British Congress on Tuberculosis was to meet in July, further action was adjourned till after the Congress, to which Councillors Prof. W. R. Smith, M.D., J.P., Walter R. Aldridge, the Rev. .Edward Canney and myself were appointed delegates. RESOLUTIONS PASSED AT THE FINAL GENERAL MEETING OF THE BRITISH CONGRESS ON TUBERCULOSIS, ON FRIDAY, JULY 27, 1901. 1. That tuberculous sputum is the main agent for the conveyance of the virus of tuberculosis from man to man, and that indiscriminate spitting should therefore be suppressed. 2. That it is the opinion of this Congress that all public hospitals and dispensaries should present every patient suffering from phthisis with a leaflet containing instructions with regard to the prevention of consumption, and should supply and insist on the proper use of a pocket-spittoon. 3. That the voluntary notification of cases of phthisis attended with tuberculous expectoration, and the increased preventive action which it has rendered practicable, has been attended by a promising measure of success, and that the extension of notification should be encouraged in all districts in which efficient sanitary administration renders it possible to adopt the consequential measures. 4. That the provision of sanatoria is an indispensable part of the measures necessary for the diminution of tuberculosis. 5. That in the opinion of this Congress and in the light of the work that has been presented at its sittings, Medical Officers of Health should continue to use all the powers at their disposal, and relax no effort to prevent the spread of tuberculosis by milk and meat. 6. That, in view of the doubts thrown on the identity of human and bovine tuberculosis, it is expedient that the Government be approached and requested to institute an immediate enquiry into this question, which is of vital importance to the public health, and of great consequence to the agricultural industry. 7. That the educational work of the great national societies for the prevention of tuberculosis is deserving of every encouragement and support. It is through their agency that a rational public opinion may be formed, the duties of public health officers made easier of performance, and such local and State legislation as may be requisite called into existence. 8. That this Congress is of opinion that a permanent international committee should be appointed (a) to collect evidence and report on the measures that have been adopted for the prevention of tuberculosis in different countries; (b) to publish a popular statement of these measures; (c) to keep and publish periodically a record of scientific research in relation to tuberculosis; (d) to consider and recommend measures of prevention. This Congress is further of opinion that all international and great national societies whose object is the prevention of tuberculosis should be invited to co-operate. 9. That in the opinion of this Congress, overcrowding, defective ventilation, damp and general insanitary conditions in the houses of the working classes, diminish the chance of curing Consumption and aid in predisposing to and spreading the disease. 10. That the following question be submitted for the consideration of the next Congress on Tuberculosis: The constitutional conditions of the individual which predispose to tuberculosis, and the means by which they may be modified. 26 11. That, while recognising the great importance of sanatoria in combating tuberculosis in all countries, the attention of Government should be directed to informing charitable and philanthropic individuals and societies of the necessity for anti-tubercular dispensaries as the best means of checking tubercular disease among the industrial and indigent classes. This Report was considered by the Public Health Committee, but no action was recommended. INFLUENZA. Only 9 deaths were last year assigned to Influenza ; 1 in Bloomsbury and 8 in the Holborn Sub-division. ALCOHOLISM. 29 deaths were assigned to Acoholism or Cirrhosis of the Liver; 19 in Bloomsbury and St. Giles and 10 in the Holborn Sub-division. These represent but a small proportion of the deaths that are really caused by Alcoholism, which are generally registered as due to secondary causes. Further details of the causes of, and ages at, death are given in Table IV. of the Appendix. SUDDEN AND VIOLENT DEATHS. Inquests. The following inquests on the bodies of Parishioners were held:- Coroner: Dr. G. P. Danford Thomas, 87, Euston Road, N.W. Inquiry Officer : Mr. J. Bryant, 7, Cobden Buildings, King's Cross Road.

This very successful Congress was held at Eastbourne, July 24th to the 29th inclusive. The Duke of Devonshire was the President of the Congress; the Right Worshipful the Mayor of Eastbourne (Alderman Keay), the Honorary President; and the Town Clerk (H. W. Fovargue, Esq.) and the Medical Officer of Health (W. J. Willoughby, Esq., M.D.), the Honorary Secretaries. The Holborn Council appointed as Delegates, Alderman Trenner and Councillors, Prof. W. 11. Smith, M.D., J.P. (the President of the Institute), and Guildford Lewis, and the Medical Officer of Health. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890. The following are the proceedings that have been taken daring the year under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890 : Under Part I. of the Act, the area known as the Italian Colony was represented as an unhealthy area. Under Part II. of the Act, Section 30; 37, Kingsgate Street, and Nos. 1, 7, 10, 17 and 27, Leather Lane Buildings were represented as unhealthy dwelling houses. A closing order was obtained for No. 37, Kingsgate Street, and the dwellings in Leather Lane Buildings were closed after correspondence with the Town Clerk. THE ITALIAN COLONY. The area known as the Italian Colony which was represented, included all the premises in the following :- Eyre Court, Nos. 1 to 12 inclusive. Eyre Terrace, Nos. 3, 4 and 5. Eyre Place, Nos. 1 and 2. Summer Court, Nos. 1 to 6 inclusive. Fleet Row, Nos. 1 to 15 inclusive. Eyre Street Hill, Nos. 6 to 31 inclusive. Little Bath Street, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4½ 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. Summer Street, Nos. 1 to 20 inclusive. Warner Street, 24 to 58 inclusive, (even Nos.) Back Hill, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. I carefully inspected all the premises, and made a detailed report of each of them, of which the following was the summary :— In this area the houses generally are old and worn and many are dangerously dilapidated. In many the foundations have sunk so that the landings and floors are slanting and sunken and walls bulged and in some cases fissured. In many the floors, landings and stairs are worn and broken. In many the walls, hearths and ceilings are broken and dilapidated. In some the roofs are defective causing dampness of the rooms beneath. Many of the gutters are also defective and rain water pipes broken and do not discharge over proper gullies. Many of the houses have no through ventilation, nor ventilation under the ground floors. Many of the houses have no back areas and many others but very small ones. Some of the rooms are very dark and a few have ventilation only by means of the door. The efficient ventilation of many of the rooms is very much impeded or prevented by the defective or broken window frames, sashes and window cords, very many of the windows being on this account seldom or never opened at the top. The basements, many of which are used as dining and sitting rooms, are quite unfitted for this purpose, as they are dark cellars with no damp courses, so that many are often damp and some very damp. 28 Many of the dustbins have during the past few years been replaced by pails, but those that remain are generally foul and dilapidated or defective. The water supply to many of the houses is very unsatisfactory, as several houses in some of the courts are only supplied by a tap in the court. The drainage and sanitary conveniences of the area are defective and not in accordance with modern requirements. With but few exceptions, the drains are not ventilated and some are often blocked. Many of the houses are supplied by old-fashioned trough closets, others have the w.c.'s in bad positions, so that they are not properly lighted and ventilated. Many of the water waste preventers are often out of order and the pans very foul. The seats of the w.c.'s are also often foul or dirty, and the floors also. Although much cleansing of rooms, passages, basements and areas has been recently done during the present house-to-house inspection, there is still very much cleansing that is required. Notices were served for each of the premises to abate the nuisances, and remedy the sanitary defects that existed. These have all been complied with except some of the structural defects that would be remedied by an Improvement Scheme. UNION BUILDINGS AREA. Aylesbury Place, Clerkenwell, and Union Buildings, Holborn Improvement Scheme, 1899. After the Local Inquiry in the year 1900, a Provisional Order was made by one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, and an Act confirming the Provisional Order was afterwards passed. In 1901, Nos. 15, 16 and 17, Yerulam Street, forming part of this area were closed and demolished. REID'S BREWERY SITE. The Reid's Brewery site which was purchased by the London County Council for the erection of Working Class Lodging Houses, for 1,681 of the 3,700 persons of the working class that will be displaced by the new Holborn-to-the-Strand Street. During 1901 the site was cleared and the erection of the houses begun. HERBRAND STREET SITE. This site has been cleared for providing for 680 of the 3,700 persons of the working class displaced by the new Holborn-to-the-Strand Street.

Many changes have taken place in the Staff of Sanitary Inspectors during the year; Inspectors Bond and Robinson had their offices abolished under the London Government Act, 1899, and ended their duties on the 24th April, and the 11th May, 1901, respectively. Mr. McQuinn was elected Sanitary Inspector to the Royal Borough of Kensington and resigned his duties here on the 15th June. To fill these vacancies Inspectors Clark, Gregory and Larard were elected by the Council, and began their work in this Borough on the 13th May, 1st June, and 8th July respectively. During the year ending the 28th December, 1901 : — The number of inspections and visits made was 16,592 „ „ „ intimation notices served was 1,928 „ statutory „ „ „ 480 „ „ „ summonses under the Public Health Act 36 „ „ „ „ under the Food and Drugs Acts 22 Further details of the Sanitary Inspectors' work are given in the Appendix, Table V.

The Secretary of State, by a Provisional Order which came into operation on the 1st November, 1894, transferred to the London County Council the powers of the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police in respect of Common Lodging-houses. The following is a list of the Common Lodging-houses Registered in this Borough :— Of these 31 are in Bloomsbury and St. Giles for 1,742 lodgers „ „ 11 „ „ Holborn Sub-District for 655 „ Total 42 in the Borough 2,397 „ Bloomsbury and St. Giles.

According to the Report of the Medical Officer of Health of the Administrative County of London, the year 1900 was the seventh year during which Common Lodging-Houses in the County of London have been subject to regulation by the Council. The number of houses on the register at the end of the year was 528, providing accommodation for 28,311½ persons. Seven of these houses were registered for the first time in 1900. In the supervision of these houses, the Council's Inspectors made 29,097 inspections, of which number 28,428 visits were made to registered, and 1,069 visits 34 were made to unregistered houses. In addition to these, 1,539 visits have been made to Seamen's lodging-houses, 662 night visits to common lodging-houses, and six night visits to unregistered houses where it was suspected that lodgers were received. During the year the Council had under consideration reports as to disturbances in common lodging-houses, and as to the need for better control of such houses in respect of disorderly conduct. The Council resolved to inform the Local Government Board that the Council was of opinion that the power of annually licensing common lodging-houses was needed. The Local Government Board informed the Council that the question of proposing legislation on the matter was under consideration. DAIRIES, COW SHEDS AND MILK SHOPS, SLAUGHTER-HOUSES AND OFFENSIVE BUSINESSES. Under the London Government Act, 1899, it became the duty of the Borough Councils to enforce the bye-laws and regulations for the time being in force with respect to dairies and milk shops, and with respect to slaughter-houses, knackers' yards, and offensive businesses. All these premises have been inspected from time to time, and notices served for all nuisances or breaches of regulations that have been found. DAIRIES AND MILK SHOPS. The number of registered dairies and milk shops in the borough is 156, of which 64 are in Bloomsbury and St. Giles, and 92 are in the Holborn Sub-District. During the year, 14 were newly registered in Bloomsbury and St. Giles, and 19 in the Holborn Sub-District. COW SHEDS. There are only two cow sheds in the Borough, viz.:— No. 4 Goldsmith Street, and Union Buildings, Leather Lane. The latter is included in the Union Buildings area, for which after a local enquiry, a Provisional Order was made in 1900 for improving the area, and which was subsequently confirmed by Act of Parliament. SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. There are only three slaughter-houses in the Borough, viz.:— No. 23 Store Street, No. 29 "Red Lion Yard, Yorkshire Grey Yard, Eagle Street. OFFENSIVE BUSINESSES. The only offensive business in the Borough, is that of a tripe dresser and boiler at Nos. 67 and 68 Leather Lane. These premises are also included in the Union Buildings area, and will be demolished as provided by the scheme for improving the area. 35 FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS.

On the same barrow there were also 5 fowls and 25 rabbits that were sound. The salesman was convicted and sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment without the option of a fine. . - 41 tins of "blown" and burst tins of machine-skimmed condensed milk were handed over and a condemned note given. I also personally inspected the slaughter-houses, butchers' shops, and many provision shops where tinned food was sold. SMOKE ABATEMENT. Much attention was given to the abatement of smoke from boilers and furnaces. The chimney shafts of the Borough were frequently kept under observation and 12 notices were served to abate smoke nuisances. METEOROLOGY. The mean temperature for the year was 49°.2. The rainfall was 20.28 inches, being 4.52 inches below the average of the preceding 86 years. Further details are given in Table VIII. I desire to express my appreciation of the excellent assistance and hearty co-operation that I have received from the Staff of the Public Health Department during the year, and the readiness with which they have taken their turns for work after office hours and on Sundays, during the outbreak of small-pox. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. A. BOND. 37 TABLE I. Vital Statistics of Whole District during 1901 and Previous Years.
