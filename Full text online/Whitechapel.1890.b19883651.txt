WHI 38 THE ANNUAL REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, (with vital and other statistics), For 52 WEEKS OF THE YEAR 1890, by JOSEPH LOANE, M. R. C. P. Ed., diplomate in public health, university of cambridge ; associate of the college of state medicine ; member of the sanitary institute ; etc. MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Instructor in Vaccination, and Public Vaccinator. LONDON : PENNY AND HULL, PRINTERS, LEMAN STREET, WHITECHAPEL, E. 1891. Offices of the Whitechapel District Board of Works, No. 15, Great Alie Street, London, E., January 29th, 1891. Gentlemen, For the seventh time I have the honor to present for your perusal an Annual Statement dealing with various particulars which concern the health and welfare of the parishes over which your Board exercises control. In doing so, I must admit that year by year as we travel away from the last Census year, the greater becomes the difficulty in estimating the population of the Whitechapel District. In the absence of this most important factor many of the figures lose much of their value. It is impossible to even determine with sufficient accuracy to serve any useful purpose such a necessary detail as the death-rate. Such tables and figures as I can with any certainty produce for your acceptance will be forthcoming, and we must rest satisfied with such rather crude materials until the advent of a new Census places us in a position more secure. I have hitherto relied upon calculations founded upon the birth-rates determined by the Census years, 1871 and 1881. A glance at the tables I have prepared, and which I here introduce, will prove that in the first table the last two columns cannot be devoid of error when they are considered by the light of the preceding columns, together with some of the other tables which I append to this Report. Nor would reflection lead us to imagine that the estimates contained in the two columns referred to were very trustworthy, because they pre-suppose the stationary condition of the birth-rate, whereas it is probable that the birth-rate of the Whitechapel population has increased. Such increase in the birth-rate is rendered more probable in our district by reason of the great addition it has received during the last few years to the number of its Model Dwellings, where the choice of selection which is freely exercised aggregates persons of an age eminently calculated to increase the number of births. To a certain extent such tendency must be counteracted by the opening of new lodging-houses where only men are accommodated. 4 On the whole however 1 am impelled to think that my estimate of the district population is under-stated and that in consequence the death-rate is fixed too high.

The large increase in the deaths in Spitalfields I am at a loss to explain. Mile End New Town and Goodman's Fields Sub-Districts require no remark beyond stating the fact that little or no change has occurred in the dwellings contained in them during the past few years. Whitechapel Church and Aldgate Sub-Districts have both increased in population by reason of new model dwellings which have been erected. The increase in the number of deaths so far as they are concerned is thus accounted for. The Whitechapel District as a whole has not yet reached its limit of increase, because several blocks of Artizans' dwellings are still in course of erection, and I therefore decline to commit myself to any statement of population which can be considered as strictly accurate. 5 The total births which were registered in the Whitechapel District during the 52 weeks of the year 1890 amounted to 2,730. In the Infirmary during the year 105 children were born, of which number 10 did not belong to district residents. I have distributed the remaining births amongst the sub-distridts where the mothers previously resided, and the births as corrected are set forth in the Tables A and Ai of the appendix.* The total deaths which were registered, during the year, numbered 2,481. They were registered in the sub-districts according to Table B. From this number must be deducted the deaths of 777 persons not pertaining to the district, although residing within it at the time of death. To the number thus arrived at should be added the 162 deaths of residents in various outlying districts of the Metropolis or in the extra-Metropolitan Asylums. Thus the correct district mortality amounts to 1,866. These figures are detailed in the customary forms in the Tables of the Appendix, B, C, D. In the absence of more reliable data, assuming the birth-rates for 1871 and 1881 to afford some index to the birth-rate now, I state our present population at 77,714. This will indicate a death-rate of 24 per 1000 for the year under consideration. The deaths of non-residents, which numbered 777, were registered as follows:—In the London Hospital, 764; in the Whitechapel Union Infirmary, 10; and in the Aldgate subregistration district, 3. One half of our people whose deaths were registered in public Institutions outside the Whitechapel Distridt, died in the Asylums' Board Hospitals and extra-Metropolitan Asylums. In the London General Hospitals a total of 65 district residents died, whilst in the London Hospital 144, and in the Whitechapel Infirmary 395 residents' deaths were respectively registered. Of the total 1,866 deaths of residents which took place during the year, no less than 35.4 per cent. occurred in public institutions. The births exceeded the deaths in number by 854. * Page 24. 6 Percentage of Deaths for each Age period :— 26.7 % of the total deaths took place under the age of 1 year. 18.1 „ „ „ between the ages of 1 and 5. 4.9 „ „ „ „ 5 and 20. 12.5 „ „ „ „ 20 and 40. 19.7 „ „ „ „ 40 and 60. 159 „ „ „ „ 60 and 80. 2.0 „ „ „ over the age of 80. In Table F * of the Appendix will be found registered the deaths, according to age-distribution. The deaths of infants under the age of one year, in London, equalled 23.5 per cent. of the total deaths, and 16.2 per cent. of the registered births: whilst in the Whitechapel District, those infants who died under the age of one year, equalled 26.7 per cent. of the total deaths, and 18.3 per cent. of the registered births. The deaths of children under five years of age, including the above, were for London equal to 40.1 per cent. of the total deaths and 27.6 per cent. of the registered births; and for the Whitechapel District they were equal to 44.9 per cent. of the total deaths, and 30.8 per cent. of the registered births. A classification of the causes of death appears in Table I †, where I have contrasted the Metropolitan and District deaths from each class of disease. A result very much in accord with that noted in previous years is apparent. The zymotic deaths are fewer amongst the Whitechapel residents, whilst the deaths from Respiratory and Constitutional diseases are more than those recorded for the entire Metropolis. This is what we should have anticipated, because so many of the residents are employed in dock labour and river-side work. Not a single death is entered under the heading of Small-pox. In fact only 3 Metropolitan deaths were registered as due to that disease. As the third volume of the evidence taken by the Royal Commission on Vaccination has recently been published, it is probable that before long the Report of the Commission will be laid before Parliament. I have read very critically the evidence, which is very exhaustive, and to my mind it seems clear that the * Page 26. † Page 28. 7 death-blow has been given to the arguments of the opponents to vaccination. That vaccination and early re-vaccination can combat small-pox is conclusively proved. At the same time, of course, due attention to improved sanitation is advisable, and in every case immediate isolation should be enforced. Measles, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, and Diarrhœa, were fatal respectively in 59, 52, 53, and 59 cases, whilst all the other named 16 zymotic diseases proved fatal in 50 instances. Scarlet Fever was responsible for 17 deaths. The "Notification of Infectious Diseases Act" has been in operation during the year. From Table O * may be gleaned the enormous amount of labour which has been imposed upon your Sanitary staff by its provisions, for it must be borne in mind that every case has been inquired into, and in every case thorough disinfection has been carried out. Your Inspectors have furnished me with a Report detailing to some extent their work in this and other matters. It contains an epitome of their efforts for the welfare of the district, and therefore, whilst according to them personally my thanks for their co-operation, I have re-produced the chief items contained in their report for your information. Table P† tabulatos the most important items of the Inspectors' work for the year, and I am pleased to inform you that progress has been made in the sytematic house to house inspection through the district, which I foreshadowed in my last annual report. EXTRA-METROPOLITAN ASYLUMS' DEATHS:— The deaths which took place during the year, in extraMetropolitan Asylums, were as follows In Banstead Asylum 7 Colney Hatch „ 13 Caterham „ 2 Leavesden ,, 9 Brain disease proved fatal in 20 instances; in 5 phthisis was the registered cause of death; heart disease and chest complications were responsible for 3 deaths, and 2 deaths were attributed to other diseases. * Page 31. † Page 33. 8 VIOLENT DEATHS:— The deaths from violence numbered 59.

During the year the causes of death in 328 cases were investigated in the district by the Coroners. Of these 190 were cases where the deceased belonged to Whitechapel. In connection with this subject the district may be congratulated upon the near approach of the commencement of a building wherein the dead may remain pending interment and where the Coroner may hold court when necessary. By the kindness of your Surveyor I am 9 permitted to introduce a brief statement concerning the chief features of the District Mortuary and Coroner's Court, etc., which will be executed after the plans of Mr. W. La Riviere. He thus describes the proposed works :— The buildings are to be erected upon brick Arches, Girders, and Columns, all upon one floor, the dimensions of the different rooms being as follows :— Coroner's Court, 16 feet by 23 feet, lighted from above and side lights from George Yard. Coroner's Consulting Room, Lavatory attached, 9 feet by 12 feet, light from George Yard. Waiting Room, 10 feet by 12, Lavatory attached, lighted from Destructor Yard. Post Mortem Room, 15 feet by 12 feet, lighted from above and Destructor Yard (with necessary hot and cold water apparatus.) Infectious Mortuary, 14 feet by 12 feet, lighted from George Yard. Hebrew Mortuary, 16 feet by 12 feet, lighted from George Yard, Hebrew Watcher's Room and Lavatories attached, lighted from George Yard. Catacomb Mortuary, comprising ten separate compartments, with independent ventilation to each, and lighted and ventilated from above. Viewing Lobby to Mortuaries, 14 feet by 14 feet, lighted and ventilated from above. Lift provided from ground floor into Viewing Lobby. Landing in centre of building, lighted and ventilated from above. The floors to the Post Mortem Room, Mortuaries, Catacombs, Viewing Lobby, Watcher's Room, and W.C., formed with Portland cement. The floors to Waiting Rooms, Lavatory, Coroner's Court, and W.C., formed with pitch pine wood blocks, laid herring-bone pattern. UNCERTIFIED DEATHS. Only 3 uncertified deaths occurred, viz. :—A male, aged one hour, certified by a midwife as premature birth. This was in the Goodman's Fields sub-district. In the Spitalfields sub-district two deaths were stated to be due to Bronchitis; one was a B 10 woman, aged 38, and the other a girl, aged two years. All were registered, by instruction of the Coroner, without inquests. WATER SUPPLY TO THE DISTRICT. From the published monthly returns furnished by the experts who examine regularly into the condition of the water supplied by the Companies, it appears that good water has been distributed in sufficient quantity during the year. Constant service is the mode of supply nearly throughout the District. REGISTERED COMMON LODGING HOUSES. 1890. Name of Street. No of Houses registered. Deaths in Infirmary and elsewhere of Lodgers.

They often serve as half-way houses between places outside our boundaries and the Whitechapel Union Infirmary. Of the 219 deaths of these persons under consideration, which took place in Public Institutions, 181 were registered in the Infirmary, and 12 in the London Hospital. Nearly 30 per cent. of the deaths were due to Phthisis. If these figures have any value, they show the urgent need for legislation which shall provide for the welfare of the "submerged tenth."

Wentworth buildings 222 674 532 1206 21 totals 2790 6269 4142 10411 244 Of the total Deaths in Model Dwellings, there were 9 from Diphtheria, 3 from Enteric Fever, 1 from Puerperal Fever, 18 from Measles, 5 from Diarrhœa, and 9 from Whooping Cough. Over 20 per cent. of the Deaths were registered in Public Institutions, B 2 12 Very much attention has been given for some years past towards improving the dwellings of the poor, and, indeed, special legislation has been introduced with this object in view. It is therefore of interest, to review, so far as we are able, the results of work in this direction. In our own District, for instance, it appears that the inhabitants of Model Dwellings constitute 13.3 per cent. of the estimated population, and the deaths bear almost exactly the same proportion to the total deaths as they bear for the entire District. Such a result, therefore, does not indicate the happy condition which, a priori, one would have looked for, when it is taken into consideration that a choice of selection of tenants is possible in the one case, which is of course impossible in the other case. Then, again, when the specific causes of death are inquired into, it is found that, so far as Zymotic diseases are concerned, the per centage of deaths to total deaths in Model Dwellings is 18 per cent. against 14.63 per cent. for the whole District. Constitutional diseases, also, when examined in the same way, are 23.7 per cent. in Model Dwellings, and 20.31 per cent. for the whole District. Then notice the per centage of deaths for each age period, and contrast the result with the table which I have given for the whole district. 23.6 of the total deaths took place under the age of 1 year. 28.6 „ „ „ between the ages of 1 and 5 years. 6.9 „ „ „ „ „ 5 „ 20 „ 9.4 „ „ „ „ „ 20 „ 40 „ 12.2 „ „ „ „ „ 40 ,, 60 ,, 8.1 „ „ „ „ „ 60 ,, 80 ,, 0.8 „ ,, „ over the age of 80 ,, I am of course aware that, to draw safe conclusions, it is necessary to know the ages of those persons who are living. Yet the factors which I have introduced for your consideration, certainly to my mind, seem to indicate that the whole subject should very seriously be investigated. It is of immense moment to determine whether the multiplication of huge barracks in the Metropolis really tends to benefit the masses. It may be that the outcome of a strictly exhaustive inquiry will point rather towards providing for the artizan class outside the Metropolitan area altogether. 13 VACCINATION RETURNS. As usual, I include in my tables a record of the Vaccination work which has been achieved during the year. These valuable figures record the continued useful and careful work of Mr. W. M. S. Sherman, the Vaccination Officer. His results are known and appreciated outside the Whitechapel Union. In the last returns received by the Local Government Board, it appears that whilst in one Union the per centage of cases not finally accounted for was 18.9; in Whitechapel and Woolwich it was 1.6 and 2.2 respectively. For the whole Metropolis 9.0 per cent. of cases remained finally unaccounted for. METEOROLOGICAL RETURNS. The concluding statistical work for the year which I propose to append as usual, are the Meteorological Tables. They deserve more careful scrutiny than I am afraid they usually receive. LEGISLATION DURING THE YEAR 1890. The enactment which has priority, on account of its importance, is the "Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890," (53 and 54 Vict., ch. 70.) This Act consolidates and amends, as also repeals "Cross's Act," "Torrens' Act," and their amendments, as well as the "Labouring Classes Dwellings Acts of 1851, 1866, and 1867," ; the "Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1885," except sections 3, 7, 9, and 10 (so far as the latter relates to bye-laws). It also repeals the "Labouring Classes Lodging Houses (England) Act of 1851," and the "Labouring Classes Lodging Houses (Ireland) Acts," and the "Dwelling Houses (Scotland) Act." It is divided into seven parts, which contain 103 sections. Certain temporary provisionsand seven schedules are also included in this Act. Part i. may, for all practical purposes, be thought of as Cross's Act. Part ii. is Torrens' Act much amended. It gives power to local authorities to prepare schemes very similiar to the arrangement in part i. An element of doubtful benefit has been the substitution of the Medical Officer for the Surveyor, as the Official upon whom is cast the chief responsibility in its execution. It appears to have been amended with a view to compel Local Authorities to execute large improvements, which hitherto had fallen to the lot of the Central Authority. The latter, 14 at its option, has power to contribute towards the cost, and herein lies the germ of future discontent and trouble, as the London County Council has not hesitated to declare its intention to share the cost only when an improvement partakes more or less of the nature of a Metropolitan improvement. An appeal to Cæsar in the event of a difference of opinion is provided for, as the Home Secretary has important functions in the case of dispute. Part iii. belongs to the County Council, and is in reality " Lord Shaftesbury's Acts," which relate to Lodging Houses. Part iv. is supplemental to the foregoing parts of the act. Parts v. and vi. apply respectively to Scotland and Ireland. Part vii. names the sections of, or the entire acts which are repealed, and also contains the schedules and temporary provisions. I do not propose to detail the many advantages and the objections which this act contain. Certain points are difficult to understand, and only in practice can the entire merits be declared patent. It has obviously been the desire of the framers of this act to enlarge the powers of the Local Authorities in dealing with insanitary dwellings and I am glad to be in a position to state that, so far as your Board is concerned, such object will be most loyally seconded. INFECTIOUS DISEASES (PREVENTION) ACT, 1890. (53 and 54 Vict, ch. 34.) This act became operative on the 4th December last. Your board, during the same month, decided to inforce all the provisions contained in it. The act has reference to the inspection of dairies under certain conditions. It also gives power to prohibit the supply of milk within a district, when such supply reasonably appears to have been the cause of the introduction of disease therein. Its other sections have reference to the cleansing and disinfecting of premises, bedding, etc., as well as providing a penalty on persons causing rooms, where infectious diseases have appeared, to be let, without declaring what has taken place. Precautions regarding the dead, etc., and other important provisions concerning sanitary matters are contained in this act, which consists of 34 sections. 15 CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACT, 1890. (54 Vict., ch. 8). Section 26 (2). Previous to the passing of this act, a Treasury Minute had conceded to certain owners of property that which is contained in the section I have named. It is certainly remarkable that, until it became law, nothing was known amongst Local Vestries or District Boards of this provision concerning a matter which imposes much responsibility and great labour upon Medical Officers of Health. The secftion mentioned was brought to your notice as well as to mine by a letter, dated 19th September, 1890, and signed by the secretary of the Local Government Board. It recites : — "The section provides that the assessment to inhabited house "duty of any house originally built or adapted by additions or "alterations and used for the sole purpose of providing separate "dwellings for persons at rents not exceeding for each dwelling "the rate of seven shillings and sixpence a week, and occupied "by persons paying such rents, is to be discharged by the "commisioners acting in the execution of the acts relating to the "inhabited house duties, providing that a certificate is produced "to them to the effect that the house is so constructed as to afford "suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons "inhabiting it, and that due provision is made for their sanitary "requirements. The certificate is to be obtained from the "Medical Officer for Health for the district in which the house is "situate or from some other medical practioner appointed as "hereinafter mentioned. "The Act makes it the duty of the Medical Officer of Health "of a district, on request by the. person who would be liable to "pay the house duty on any house in the district, if the duty were "not discharged by the Commissioners, to examine the house for "the purpose of ascertaining whether a certificate can properly be "given; and if the house is constructed so as to afford suitable "accommodation for each of the families or persons inhabiting it, "and due provision is made for their sanitary requirements, he "must certify the same accordingly. "The Act however, provides that where the authority by 16 "whom the Medical Officer of Health is appointed are of opinion "that the duties which would thus devolve on him could not be "performed by him without interference with the due performance "of his ordinary duties, they may appoint some other legally "qualified medical practitioner, having the qualification required "for the office of Medical Officer of Health of the District, to "make the examinations and give the certificates above referred " to. "I am directed to add that the Act does not empower a "Medical Officer of Health to charge any fee for a certificate "under it, nor is he entitled to any remuneration for the discharge "of the duties imposed on him by the Act in addition to the "salary for the time being assigned to him as Medical Officer of "Health." Of course, to effect the purpose of this Act, those certificates are renewable annually. I may add that, in some instances, I have had to call upon the owners of some houses to remedy grave sanitary defects, which, but for the special inspection, might have escaped observation for some time. It may be useful to quote the result of the deliberations of Metropolitan Officers of Health, concerning a reference to them by the Conference of Metropolitan Members of Vestries and District Boards, which took place on the 5th December last, in the County Hall, Spring Gardens. The reference demanded some common understanding concerning the meaning of the words contained in Part ii. of the "Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890," which runs as follows :—"A condition so dangerous "or injurious to health, as to be unfit for human habitation." REPORT. "Whether a house is dangerous to health mainly depends "upon— (a) Site and surroundings. (b) Construction. (c) Age and general want of repair. (d) Nuisances. 17 (a) Site. "A dwelling-house built in a hollow, or in a situation not "admitting effectual drainage, or exposed to malarial influences, "or built in a manner, or on soil which causes or admits the air "to be contaminated by injurious gasses, might be properly "represented under section 30 of the ' Housing of the Working "Classes Act, 1890.' "The fact that a dwelling-house is built on a site so sur"rounded by buildings that access of sufficient light and air is "impossible, would, in our opinion, be a good ground for repre"sentation. (b) Construction. "Under this head would be classed original defect of plan; "for example, a dwelling house improperly ventilated or lighted, "or with the closet and dust-bin so situated as to cause nuisance " within the house. "Any condition which results in permanent dampness. Such "faulty construction of chimney-flues as permits products of com"bustion from adjoining premises to permanently contaminate "the air of living-rooms. (c) Age and General Want of Repair. "This, when it reaches a degree of dilapidation, is obviously "a just cause for representation. (d) Nuisances. "Bad drainage, faulty closets, filth per se, &c., are, in our "opinion, grounds for action taken under the ' Nuisances Re"moval and Sanitary Acts,' but where affecting a whole dwelling"house, or where combined with faults of site and construction, "and general want of repair, they justify action also under the "'Housing of the Working Classes Act.' "In all the above cases the question of 'degree' comes in; "it is, indeed, this question of degree that renders precise defini"tion impossible ; general principles can alone be laid down." 18 This is obviously true, but in any case it is satisfactory to know that magistrates are determined to assist Local Authorities to improve the dwellings of the poor. The above list of mal-conditions, applicable to dwelling-houses, is no new invention of Sanitary Experts, and daily experience constantly advises that greater efforts should be forthcoming to put into practice the knowledge which this experience brings. Dr. Anders, as a result of special investigations in Philadelphia, shows how much influence the width of streets exerts upon the tendency to Phthisis in the inhabitants. In other words, complete movement of air about dwellings is a point of the utmost importance. Dr. Cameron, in his Report to the Town Council of Leeds, proves that back-to-back houses increase the risk of those living in them from death by Diarrhoea; thus 81 per cent. of the deaths within his town, took place in houses which had no through draughts, against 19 per cent. in houses with thorough ventilation. You will therefore be prepared after these remarks to hear that I propose shortly to call your attention to some of those houses in your District which fall short of the requirements which are necessary to constitute a healthy home. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOSEPH LOANE. 19 Board of Works, Whitechapel District, Sanitary Department. Sir, In connection with the year's work, which has been tabulated in the usual way, we have to report upon the Extra Important Works (the results of which are included in the tabulated work mentioned), which have been carried out under our supervision during the past year. Nos.7,9,11,13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 27, 29, 31, & 33, Pelham Street, &1,2&3, Spital Street. These houses were in a most filthy dilapidated, and ruinous condition, the closets were filthy and dilapidated, and the yards were not properly paved. Fortunately the whole of this property belonged to one owner, which made it somewhat easier to deal with the matter. This property has been put into thorough good order and condition throughout. The cost of works carried out was about ^400. Nos. 1,2,3,4,5, 6, 7,8,9,41,42, 43, 44 & 45, New Castle Street. The drainage of these houses has been reconstructed, these houses, having no yards, and the closets and drains being in the cellars, special care had to be taken; the cellars had first to be lowered to enable persons to walk upright, and subsequently cement and concrete floors fully six inches thick, were provided to each cellar. The drainage is constructed in three sections, each section having a separate connection into public sewer and constructed with stoneware pipes, with suitable fall, and embedded in concrete, with cement joints. All wastes from sinks have been conveyed into earthenware syphon gullies by means of back inlets, such gullies also taking surface water of cellars. The closets have been re-constructed. A small cesspool, taking waste water from sink only, was removed from the cellar of No. 4. This property belongs to one owner. 20 Nos. 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51 & 53, Great Garden Street. The tenants of these houses had always to pass through the cellars to get to the closets and yards. This serious objection was overcome by a portion of each ground floor back room being taken away, and the passages continued through to the rear ; the cellars need not now be used to get to the closets and yards as heretofore. This property also belongs to one owner. Nos. 1,2,3,4,5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10,11, 12, 13 & 14, Tewkesbury Buildings. The whole of these premises have been thoroughly cleansed and repaired throughout. The closets at Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, have been brought from rear of the basements and placed in newly constructed areas in front of such premises, the areas being constructed of white glazed bricks, and fitted with bull's-eye lights. The closets of Nos. 8, g, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 were, and always have been, in front of premises, but they have all been re-constructed, and the brickwork of areas rendered with cement, and such areas have been fitted with bull's-eye lights. Cottage pans and traps have been used throughout, and have been set in bricks and cement, with new seats to closets, with 4½ inch risers only; the floors of closets have been concreted and cemented throughout. New sinks have been provided where necessary, and in all cases wastes from sinks have been disconnected from drain and made to discharge over earthenware syphon gullies. The drain is now efficiently ventilated, and is provided with a fresh-air inlet, and also an inspection chamber, fitted with one of Crapper's "Kenon" intercepting traps (made from design of Dr. Corfield). These houses being back-to-back erections, special provisions had to be made for ventilation, and which was effected by taking off small portions of the rooms and staircases, and making a shaft in each house of several feet square from top of house to bottom, fitted with windows looking into every room and on to every landing, such windows being made to open and shut, as well as the glass in top panes being so put in as to leave an inch opening at top. Each shaft was fitted with skylight and fixed louvres. By these means, additional light and ventilation was obtained. The property belonged to one owner, and the cost of the works carried out was over £1000. 21 Nos. 41 & 42, Great Alie St., Norwich Court, 7, Artillery Passage, 12, Spital Square. Cesspools were found at each of these premises, and it will be interesting to give a few particulars relating to each, taking them in the order given. 1st. —For some considerable time filthy matter had been percolating into basement of Jewish Working Men's Club, in Great Alie Street, from the adjoining premises, and it was not until every effort had failed to find out the cause, that a complaint was lodged at this office. Upon visiting No. 42, Great Alie Street, the drain was found stripped for inspection, and there seemed nothing apparently wrong with it. The drain of No. 41, which adjoins, was ordered to be opened up and was found to be very defective, and the soil beneath very much saturated. Orders were given for all wet and filthy soil to be removed, and after going down about two feet the top of a large cesspool was discovered; this was ordered to be immediately cleared out, and was subsequently filled in with dry rubbish. The cesspool was circular in shape, 9 feet in diameter and 9 feet deep, and there were 3 disused brick barrel drains running into it. The party-wall dividing yards of Nos. 41 and 42, Great Alie Street, and the closets of each house were built over this cesspool, which had no other cover except the 2 feet of earth mentioned. There is now no percolation into the Club premises whatever. 2nd.—A circular cesspool, about 7 feet by 2 feet 6 inches diameter, was found in Norwich Court, through the brick barrel drain being opened up to find out cause of a stoppage. This cesspool had an overflow into a deep shoot, and all drainage passed down same and into and through the drain of No. 18, Upper East Smithfield. Nos. 16 and 17, Upper East Smithfield were connected into the brick barrel drain in Norwich Court. The cesspool was cleared out and filled in with dry rubbish and concrete. The discovery of this cesspool led to the re-construction of drains of Nos 16, 17 and 18, Upper East Smithfield, and to the construction of a pipe sewer in Norwich Court, the latter work being carried out by the Surveyor, Mr. W. La Riviere. 3rd.—The circumstances which led to the discovery of a cesspool at No. 7, Artillery Passage were somewhat similar to those relating to Nos. 41 and 42, Great Alie Street. The cesspool in 22 this case was not so near the surface, but was of the dimensions 6 feet by 7 feet by 6 feet. The contents were removed and the space filled in with dry rubbish. 4th.—The cesspool at No. 12, Spital Square was only a small one, and was cleared out and filled in with dry rubbish. Nos. 16,17&18, Upper East Smithfield, 2, 3 & 4, Tenter Street East, 31, 33, 35, 37 and 39, Scarboro St. 9, & 11, St. Mark Street, Synagogue, Scarboro St., 72, 74, 76, Brady Street, 40, 42 & 44, Middlesex St., 84, Commercial Street, 21, Fieldgate St. The drains in all these premises have been entirely re-constructed thoughout with stoneware pipes embedded in concrete with cement joints. All wastes from sink and all rain water pipes were made to discharge over earthenware syphon gullies Earthenware syphon gullies have been used in all cases to take off surface water in yards, etc., and have taken the place of various descriptions of defective and useless traps. The whole of the drains have been ventilated. In all but one instance fresh air inlets have been provided. Syphon intercepting traps have been provided in every case, and inspection manholes have been constructed in every case where necessary. Estimated cost of the whole of above works is £425. In conclusion, we may state that the carrying out of the "Infectious Diseases Notification Act," has involved a very considerable amount of extra work during the past year, as will be seen from the figures relating to disinfecting in the tabulated work before mentioned. We are, Sir, Your obedient Servants, RICHARD SKIDMORE WRACK, Sanitary Inspectors. THOS. P. WRACK. 23 APPENDIX. SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. WHITECHAPEL. Address. To whom Licensed. 269.
