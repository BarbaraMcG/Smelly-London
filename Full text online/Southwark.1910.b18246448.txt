Public Health Office, Town Hall, Walworth Road. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting for your consideration ray TwentyFourth Annual Report which deals with the vital statistics and general sanitary work of the Borough for the year 1910. The health of the inhabitants of the Borough has been good. There has been no outbreak of infectious disease of any importance, with the exception of Measles, and the infant mortality has been comparatively low. There has been a large amount of work in connection with the Tabard Street Area Scheme, the increased notification of Phthisis, the expansion of the work under the Pood Regulations, especially in connection with Beef imported from Australia, and a host of other matters. We have suffered at the same time from an impaired staff, which has made the work difficult. I have to thank especially the clerical portion of the staff, for the overtime given to their duties. The whole staff has done excellent work, which can be seen by the most casual inspection of the district. I have to thank the Council and the Public Health Committee for their courtesy and support. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Southwark. 6 SUMMARY OF STATISTICS Estimated population at the middle of 1910 211,832 Total Births in 1910 5,873 Total Deaths in 1910 3,360 Birth Rate for London, 1910 23.6 Do.

It may be pretty safely prophesied that the population of the Borough, during the decade just closed, has declined, and especially in the last two or three years. First and foremost since the last Census is the extraordinary exodus of persons of every degree from the central districts to the suburbs. This movement has been a highly necessary and beneficial one, and has relieved the serious condition of overcrowding which existed before the electrification of the tramways. Other causes have been at work, such as the clearance of debased areas. It is only necessary to niention the vast clearance scheme of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners in Walworth, extending over twenty three or more acres. The London County Council's schemes of Webber Row and Kings Bench Walk, all of which areas at the present time are only partially occupied. There is also the commencing migration of the residents from the Tabard Street area which was represented in the latter part of 1909, and which is still under consideration. Further, on every hand, warehouses and factories are encroaching on the residential parts of the districts. With all these changes, however, we have still many spots in the Borough needing the greatest sanitary supervision. Individual blocks of dwellings and houses unfit for human habitation have been proceeded against in the year under consideration, under the Town Planning Act. I am told by persons who are acquainted with life in Southwark that the sanitary condition of the Borough, especially in regard to personal and house cleanliness, has improved during the last ten years. I am glad to have independent testimony of any benefit. It is only fair to the Council and the Borough Engineer to note the improvement in the lighting and paving of the streets, the better collection of house dust and cleanliness of the streets, with many other matters increasing the comfort of the inhabitants. More attention has been given to imported foods and to foods brought into the district from the country. The Council has a special inspector for the work. 8 POPULATION—(continued).

The number of Births registered in the Borough during 1910 was 5,627, of which 2,805 were males, and 2,822 females. This represents a birth-rate of 266 per 1,000 inhabitants. The number of births registered, belonging to the individual parishes was as follows:—Newington, 3,381; St. George the Martyr, 1,689; Christchurch, 259; and St. Saviour's, 298. In addition to these 5,627 births registered in the Borough I learn from the Registrar General that there were 246 births during the year in various Lying-in and other institutions outside the Borough belonging to 10 persons resident in Southwark, and this number (246) must he added to the total as above, making the actual number of births for the year 5,873, which increases the birth-rate to 27.8 per 1,000.

Of the 2,866 deaths registered in the sub-districts of the Borough, 1,114 occurred in the Poor-Law Institutions, the various hospitals, and other public places for the treatment of the sick found within our boundaries. These deaths in institutions comprised 413 belonging to Southwark, and 701 to other sanitary districts. The various localities in which the "outlying " deaths occurred are shown in the following table. The number of inhabitants belonging to the Borough dying away from home—that is, outside our boundaries in the various hospitals and infirmaries—was 1,218. Of this very large number as many as 749 died in the Southwark Infirmary at Champion Hill. The remainder, with but few exceptions, died in the large public hospitals. The percentage of persons dying away from home in relation to the total number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 36.2. When those persons who were non-parishoners, but who died in our Borough have been deducted, and the out-lying deaths added, the actual or "corrected" number of deaths belonging to the Sanitary Area is found to be 3,360, of which number 1,802 were males, and 1,558 females. The death-rate when calculated on this "corrected" number is 15.9 per 1,000 inhabitants for the whole Borough for the year 1910, as against a rate of 16.7 for 1909. TABLE 3.

The deaths from Scarlet Fever in the Borough were 9 during 1910, as against 14, 24, 35, 45 and 28 for the preceding five years. The usual cycle of five years, that scarlet fever in its incidence has been observed to take for many years past, has extended this year, as, instead of the disease taking an up grade this year, the decline in the number of cases still continues. The small fatality from the disease is remarkable. This is due either to a growing immunity to the disease, or to improvement in the conditions under which our inhabitants live. The severity of the complaint is much affected by the unwholesome home surroundings of the patients. Where overcrowding and foul smelling rooms exist the disease is always more fatal. To avoid the unpleasant consequences of the disease children should be well fed, warmly clad, and the rooms of the house well ventilated. In no part of the district can there be said to have been any special outbreak of the disease as the cases have been pretty evenly scattered about the Borough. Every case has been as usual, carefully inquired into, and a full statement of all contacts sent on to those interested or concerned in the matter. The total number of cases notified was 419, as against 590 for 1909. The percentage of deaths to the total cases notified was 2.1. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.04. 58 The number of cases notified, as compared with London, during the last ten years was:— In Southwark. In London. In Southwark.

The deaths in the 413 cases sent to hospital numbered 9, a mortality of 2.2 per cent. In the 6 cases treated at home, there was no death. It is our practice to spray the room with formalin and to strip the paper off the walls in the process of disinfection after Scarlet Fever. In the event of the room being verminous it is afterwards fumigated with stlphur. DIPHTHERIA. There has been a comparatively small amount of this disease in the Borough during the year. No outbreak of any importance has occurred. 59 The total number of cases notified, including Membranous Croup, was 284, as against 256 for last year. The deaths from the disease numbered 35, as against 33 for 1909. The percentage of deaths to the cases notified was 12.3. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.17.

The Wards most affected were St. Michael, Trinity and Christchurch, in the order named. ENTERIC FEVER. The deaths from Enteric Fever during the year numbered 7, as against 6, 7 and 11, in the three preceding years. The total number of cases notified was 54 for the present year, and 35, 48 and 80 for the three preceding years. 60 The percentage of deaths to the total number of cases notified was 12.9. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.03. The number of cases notified during the last ten years:— 1901 135 1906 111 1902 193 1907 80 1903 122 1908 48 1904 92 1909 35 1905 74 1910 54 The number of deaths from Enteric Fever for the last ten years:— 1901 18 1906 12 1902 23 1907 11 1903 23 1908 7 1904 18 1909 6 1905 11 1910 7 Of the 54 cases notified as many as 51 were removed to hospital of which 7 died, a mortality of 13.7 per cent. In the 3 cases treated at home none died. The percentage of cases removed to hospital to the total number notified was 94.4. The Wards most affected were St. Michael, All Saints' and St. Saviour, in the order named. DIARRHÆA. A further diminution in the number of deaths from Diarrhœa has to be recorded, The lowness of the temperature during July and August and the general coldness of the summer for the last four years have been favourable to a low diarrhœa rate, and, in consequence, to a low infant death-rate. Much, however, of this reduced rate can be reasonably attributed to the improved habits of the less wealthy part of the community and the greater care bestowed upon infants. Year by year the sanitary condition of the home in poor neighbourhoods is improved, and mothers are encouraged, where possible, to breast feed and attend more carefully to their infants. 61 The annual death-rate from Diarrhœa per 1,000 living was 0.42. Deaths from diarrhœa during the last ten years:— 1901 222 1906 225 1902 169 1907 101 1903 197 1908 188 1904 282 1909 113 1905 183 1910 90 TYPHUS FEVER. No death occurred from this disease during the year, and no case was notified. MEASLES. During the year under consideration the deaths from Measles amounted to 225. This is the largest number of d( aths from the disease since the inception of the Borough, or within my recollection of twentyfive years of the district. This number of deaths would represent at least 5,000 cases as occurring during the year, and exceeded the deaths from Diarrheea and all the other notifiable diseases (excepting Phthisis) put together. Many reports have from time to time been made by Medical Officers of Health on the advisability of Measles being scheduled as a dangerous infectious disease notifiable in the ordinary way. Whilst some have recommended all cases being notified, others have advised only the first case in the family, whilst others again have recommended the duty of notification being placed upon the parents. The Southwark Borough Council have not taken any very decided action for or against compulsory notification. The mortality from Measles, or rather the excessive mortality, occurs in this Borough from the want of proper accommodation in the homes, and through the carelessness and ignorance shown by mothers and others in the management of the cases. Often the patient is taken out aud exposed to cold when the rash is just appearing, with the result that severe inflammation of the lungs is set up. The lack of hospital treatment for patients has been put forward as an argument against, notification, also that where notification has been in force for some years there has been found to be no diminution in the number of cases in the district. 62 It must be admitted that notification of the disease in a district does not appear to lessen the number of cases. The knowledge, however, of the locality of the cases, and the opportunity it gives of supervising the early treatment of them, must when that is efficiently done result in a smaller fatality. This is proved by the small fatality occurring among children of parents in comfortable circumstances. The first step, therefore, in the prevention of the excessive mortality is to discover the locality of the cases, to remove the ill-accommodated to hospital, and to supervise the remainder treated at home. With regard to the disinfection after measles I strongly advocate it if only on the grounds of cleanliness Recently arrangements have been made for the admission of patients suffering from Measles and ill accommodated at home into the hospitals of the Asylums Board on the recommendation of the Medical Officer of Health, and further, on the suggestion of the Local Government Foard, it is hoped that the information of the disease being in a family will be transmitted by the visiting School Board Official much earlier than has hitherto been the practice. Deaths from Measles during the last ten years: — 1901 161 1906 95 1902 164 1907 112 1903 83 1908 77 1904 191 1909 127 1905 154 1910 225 The death-rate per 1,000 living was 1.06. The Wards mostly affected were St. Michael, St. George and St Peter, in the order named. The number of cases of Measles reported to the Medical Officer of Health from the Schools was 2,307. Every case of Measles coming under our notice was visited and the house thoroughly inspected. Our usual handbill in regard to the prevention and treatment of the disease was widely circulated. 63 WHOOPING COUGH. The deaths from this disease were 60 for the year. The annual death-rate per 1,000 living was 0.28. Deaths from Whooping Cough for the last ten years:— 1901 98 1906 54 1902 114 1907 103 1903 68 1908 50 1904 118 1909 57 1905 80 1910 60 470 cases of Whooping Cough were notified to the Medical Officer of Health from the Schools. CEREBRO-SPINAL FEVER. During the year three cases of Cerebro-Spinal Fever were notified, of which two died. CHICKEN-POX. During the year 613 cases of Chicken Pox were notified to the Medical Officer of Health from the Schools. PHTHISIS. The total number of Phthisis cases notified during the year was 48'2, of which 112 only were notified voluntarily, the remainder being Poor Law cases. Of the 112 voluntary cases, 18 were notified from Brompton Hospital, 6 from St. Margaret's Hospital, 7 from Guy's Hospital, 11 from the Surrey Dispensary, 3 from Royal Victoria Hospital, Netley, 1 from Mount Vernon Hospital, and 1 from City Police Hospital, Bishopsgate. These figures show that voluntary notification by the Medical practitioner is scarcely ever done, and, for any good purpose, may be considered as almost useless. This cannot be denied when out of 3,000 cases of Phthisis which could be voluntarily notified only 65 cases were in that way brought to the notice of the Medical Officer of Health. Progress by stages is, however, being made towards compulsory notification, as in the vear under consideration besides all Poor Law cases steps were taken to have all those attending hospitals, whether as in or out patients, notified. This is an excellent advance. All cases of Phthisis coming to our notice are immediately visited by the ward inspector, who examines the house and makes his report. The patient or the friends at the same time are 64 supplied with printed directions pointing out what is necessary to be observed, in order to prevent the patient being a danger to those living with him. Disinfection is carried out at regular periods unless objected to. At the early part of the year the Borough Council arranged with the National Association for the use of five beds at Benenden. The first cases were sent off on July 26th, and, up to the end of the year, eleven cases were admitted. The selection of suitable cases has been a difficult matter, owing to increased duties being thrown upon the staff in other directions. In nearly all the persons presenting themselves for admission into Benenden the disease had made considerable progress, and in no case could it be said to be in the incipient stage. It is hardly to be expected in a borough, where the struggle for existence is so keen, that men, especially married men, with families dependent on them, would consent on the first onset of the disease to go away for three months to a Sanatorium, even if the danger of delay in such treatment were pointed out to them. No, they simply refuse to listen to such advice, It is natural and brave of them, but it is not the way to get cured of Phthisis. Something more than the Sanitorium is needed. To commence with, there must be an organisation, whether paid or voluntary, in close touch with the home life of our inhabitants. It is there that the health of the people must be largely protected by a strong first line of defence. In connection with Phthisis 211 contacts were carefully examined at our Reception House and reports made to the Medical Officer of the School Board and other persons concerned. Report on the cases of Phthisis in connection with the Benenden Sanatorium. The first case was sent off on August 5th, 1910. Twenty-eight persons have applied for admission into the Sanatorium of whom 15 were admitted, 8 were found to be unsuitable on account of the advanced stage of the disease, 3 had removed out of the district, and 2 are waiting for admission. Of the 15 persons admitted, 12 have been discharged, and 3 are still under treatment. At the present time there are 2 vacancies. The following is a detailed account of the history of the cases treated at the Sanatorium:— 65 The average stay at the Institution was 101 days. On a perusal of the notes of the cases sent to Benenden it will be seen that some of the cases returned home, after a three months' residence, with little improvement. This would appear to reflect somewhat on those responsible for the selection of the cases for treatment. It is unfortunate that more of the cases have not received permanent benefit, the reason is that it has been found very difficult to discover cases in the very early stage of the disease willing to go to a Sanatorium. Generally the cases reported to me have been in an advanced stage of Phthisis and not likely to receive permanent benefit anywhere. It is hoped that persons thoroughly run down will avail themselves of Sanatorium treatment before they become affected with definite tuberculosis. Case 1.—E.C.

I reported in the early part of the year, that since the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, came into operation the number of persons cleansed at the Reception House and the bedding and rooms disinfected have increased year by year. In 1908 the number of persons cleansed was 2,294, and during the year 1909, 3,000 persons with rooms and bedding were similarly treated. This is only the beginning of a consistent attempt to treat verminous persons and bedding, together with filthy and verminous homes. The value of this work, from a public health point of view, is at the present time beginning to be felt. We have hardly had time accurately to determine how much the important diminution of infectious disease that we have seen during the past two years, and the continued lessening of the death-rate have been due to the cleansing operations which have been carried on throughout ihe Borough. The dirty homes and filthy condition of the bedding and clothing can only be improved by perseverance in the carrying out of the sanitary clauses 19-20 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. During the last two years the Bathing Station, although extremely meagre in equipment, has been of great service. The point one desires to lay stress upon is the insufficient power that is possessed in the matter of collecting and returning the bedding, which, in the cases of filthy and verminous houses, we find, must be returned on the same day. Fortunately, during the last two years, infectious disease has been very low which has enabled us to collect verminous bedding in the van used for disinfected articles, and in a hand truck used in the time of the St. George's Vestry. This method of collecting in a vehicle used for disinfected articles after iufectious disease, and by hand labour with a truck, must be considered by anyone acquainted with the work as wholly unsatisfactory. To cope with the work of the year with the present means of a horsedvehicle, we shall require a duplication of that portion alone of our equipment. This would mean a further expenditure of £300 a year. There is also the large amount of time lost by the present means of collecting which is the foundation of our difficulties. If we could by means of a motor van quickly run through the Borough, I am satisfied that one motor, with a number of movable bodies, could do the whole of our work at a very little, if any, greater expense than is incurred under the present slow method of collection. The Borough Engineer reported that at the present time two disinfecting vans are in use, one for infected clothing and one for the return 77 of disinfected clothing. It is suggested a new one should be provided for verminous clothing, &c. The approximate cost of these vans is £55 each. As we have now arrived at a period when there is every likelihood of there being an extension of this work, it will be well to consider the advisability of doing away with horse drawn vehicles for this purpose and substituting motor traction. For work of this class, motor traction will have many advantages. The journeys would be much more quickly made, and would thus enable the existing disinfecting plant to be used to a greater extent. The cost of collecting and distribution would be less per mile than at present, but would vary according to the amount of work carried out, and would not, as at present, be a standing charge whether any work was carried out or not. The cost of a 15 cwt. Chassis (14 H.P.) with platform and Driver's Seat and Hood, with one moveable Van Body, would be from £350 to £400. The two existing vans could be taken off their carriages and adapted as movable bodies for about £5 each. The cost of running exclusive of wages and depreciation of machinery would be as follows:— Tyres 2d. per mile Petrol 0.¾ „ Lubrication, &c. 0¼. ,, Total 3d. In February the Council decided to purchase a motor of Messrs. Straker and Squire under the following specification:— (a) 14 H.P. 2 cylinder, 3 speed and reverse. Length 14 feet. Width 5 feet 5 inches. Weight 1 ton 10 cwts. Standard type (same type as supplied largely elsewhere). Cost £425. (b) To undertake to keep the Motor Van in running order for a period of 12 months at a cost of £120. The motor was duly delivered, and has been running for more than six months. 78 DISINFECTION. The total number of rooms treated during the year by the Council's disinfecting staff was 5,890. Of this number 1,105 rooms were disinfected after the occurrence of the ordinary notifiable infectious diseases, as against 1,198 rooms in 1909. 3,209 rooms were periodically sprayed and otherwise treated in connection with cases of Phthisis notified voluntarily or under the Tuberculosis Regulations of 1908. 1,576 verminous rooms were sulphured and otherwise cleansed by the Council's staff during the year, as against 1,097 in 1909. Of the total number of rooms disinfected (5,890) it was found necessary to strip 982 rooms. Of these 619 were in relation to the notifiable diseases, 344 after the termination of cases of Phthisis, and 19 were verminous. TABLE 36 The Locality of Rooms Disinfected.

During the year 1910, 714 persons were cleansed at the Bathing Station in King James Street, as against 2,435 persons during the year 1909. Of this number 600 were children sent from the various schools of the Londcn County Council, as against 2,324 children cleansed in 1909. An arrangement has been under consideration whereby the London County Council would pay the Borough Council a fee of 2s. for each child cleansed at the Station, the cleansing operation to be repeated if the first treatment was found to have not been efficacious. 113 adults applied under the provisions of the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, as against 111 so applying in 1909.

During the year proceedings were taken in the Police Court (Lainbeth) in relation to the following two seizures of unsound food:— (1) Charles Miller, 53 East street, for depositing for the purpose of sale 292 tins condensed milk, the said milk being unsound and unfit for the food of man. Fined £15 and 4s. costs. (2) Harry Moss, of 52, Aldgate High Street, he being the owner of a van standing in the roadway outside No. 5, East Street, in which van were found four hindquarters of Beef, which beef was unsound, unwholesome and unfit for the food of man. The following is a report of the hearing of the case, taken from a daily newspaper: — "Proceeding under one of the provisions of the Public Health Act, the Southwark Borough Council summoned Harry Moss, of Aldgate High-street, before Mr. Hopkins, at, Lambeth, yesterday, to answer the complaint that there were found deposited, for the purpose of sale, in a van in East-street, Walworth, four hindquarters of beef which were intended for food, and which were unsound and unwholesome, and that he was the person in whose possession the same were found. "Mr. G. C. Topham supported the proceedings on behalf of the Council, and Mr. Ricketts defended. "The case occupied practically the whole of the afternoon's sitting. "Mr. Topham stated that on the early morning of the 10th October last, two of the Council's inspectors were in East Street, Walworth, when they saw a carrier's van from which meat was being delivered to the premises of Mr. Nathan, a butcher. There were 12 hindquarters of beef in the van, six marked with the kosher mark, and the other six each bearing two cuts The meat was taken into Mr. Nathan's shop, but that gentleman said that only the kosher meat was for him, and the six other quarters were put back into the van. They were examined by the sanitary inspectors and the Medical Officer, and four of the quarters were seized as unsound and were afterwards condemned at this court. The carrier's carman had received instructions to deliver six kosher hindquarters to Mr. Nathan, and it was a 117 118 mistake On the part of the carman to deliver the 12 quarters at the shop. "Mr. George Fisher, a sanitary inspector in the service of the Borough Council, gave evidence in support of the summons, and stated that the four quarters seized from the van were unsound and unfit for food. "Cross-examined by Mr. Ricketts, the inspector said he examined the six kosher quarters delivered at Mr. Nathan's shop and passed them as sound. The Medical Officer passed two of the unmarked quarters in the van and condemned the other four. There were two cuts on each of the unmarked hindquarters. "Mr Ricketts.—Do you know it is the custom when meat is condemned by the wholesale man to cut it? "Inspector Fisher.—Not in the way these quarters were cut. It was simply a little notch. "I don t care what it was. Is it usual in any way to deface meat which is intended to be sold ?—I should say not. The Kosher Mark. "Answering a further question, the witness said the quarters left with Mr. Nathan bore a mark which was somewhat blurred, but which Mr. Nathan told him was the kosher mark. "Mr. Ricketts suggested that if meat was passed by the Board of Shecheta that showed it was free from disease. "Mr. Hopkins disagreed. He thought the kosher mark was a sign of the mode of death. "Mr. Ricketts believed that it was also a sign that the meat was free from disease, but said that question would not arise in this case, which only referred to the unmarked quarters. "Dr. George Millson, Medical Officer of Health for Southwark, said the four quarters seized from the van were unfit for food. Two were distinctly tuberculous. He did not see any mark upon them. 119 "Henry Hoy stated that he was formerly in the employ of Mr. Ordway, a meat carrier. On October 10th he received a load of 12 quarters of beef from the defendant's shop at Aldgate and in conscquence of instructions given him by Mr. Ordway's foreman he took the 12 quarters to Mr. Nathan's shop and unloaded them. Mr. Nathan's men brought six of the quarters out and put them in his van again. The inspectors took the van to the Council's depot and removed four of the quarters. The remaining two he delivered to a cat's meat butcher named Stockton in accordance with instructions he received by telephone whilst he was at Mr. Nathan's shop. "By Mr. Ricketts.—Mr. Nathan was not in the shop when the 12 quarters were delivered. When Mr. Nathan entered he discarded all those not marked with the kosher mark, and told him to take them away. He asked over the telephone what he was to do with the six unmarked quarters, and was told to take them to Stockton—that those were his orders at the time. When he delivered two quarters to Stockton, that man asked him where the other four quarters were. He told Stockton that the inspector had seized them. "Questioned by Mr. Topham, the witness said he was not supplied with a consignment note or delivery sheet of any kind. "George Edwards, foreman to Mr. Ordway, said he received instructions as to the delivery of the 12 quarters of beef from a man at Mr. Moss's shop. Six quarters with the kosher mark were to go to Mr. Nathan's shop and the other quarters to Mr. Stockton, who was a cat's meat butcher. After the van had left he found that proper instructions had not been given to the carman. The witness produced his order book showing that the six kosher quarters were booked to Nathan and the others to Stockton. A Commission Salesman- Addressing the Court for the defence, Mr. Ricketts contended that the evidence was conclusive that a mistake was made with regard to these hindquarters of beef. Mr. Moss was a commission salesman receiving meat from different parts of the country for sale on commission. As a matter of fact, these particular hindquarters were received by the defendant for sale 120 on commission. It was discovered as soon as they came on the premises that they were not fit for sale, and no attempt was made to sell them, it being decided to send them to a Mr. Stockton, a cat's meat man. It was not, perhaps, a wise thing, but they were put in the same van as the meat for Mr. Nathan. There was no intention on Mr. Moss's part that this meat should be consumed by human beings, and the quarters were marked by cutting them to distinguish them from the kosher meat. Stockton, to whom the quarters were sent, was a cats' meat man, who only sold meat for consumption by animals—four-legged animals. The defendant had intimated to Mr. Stockton by telephone that he was to receive these six quarters, and whether the inspectors had appeared or not these hindquarters would have gone to Stockton to be used in the usual way as cats' meat He submitted that the witnesses called for the prosecution had confirmed the statement of the defendant that this meat was not intended for human consumption. "Evidence having been given for the defence. "Mr. Hopkins remarked that he was not quite sure how far this was the defendant's own responsibility, or how far it might be a responsibility cast upon him by others, but it was a very heavy one. He was perfectly sure, after a long experience of Mr. Ricketts, that he always did the best that was to be done, and when Mr. Ricketts left the case like this he had no doubt, at all events, what the real explanation was, The defendant would have to pay a penalty of £50 and £5 5s. cost." 121 HOUSING, TOWN PLANNING, ETC.
