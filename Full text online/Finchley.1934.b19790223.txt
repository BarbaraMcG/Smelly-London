I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for 1934 on the health of the Borough. The vital statistics are not so favourable as those for 1933, which in several respects was a record year. The population as estimated by the Registrar General is I am sure too low and as the birth and death rates are calculated on his figures both rates appear to be higher than they actually are. The Infantile Mortality rate shows an increase which 1 am convinced is only temporary. The Maternal Mortality rate on the other hand shows a welcome decrease of 50%. The death rate for infectious diseases has continued to be low. I wish to express my indebtedness to Dr. Russell, Mr. Franklin, and all the staff of the Public Health Department for their loyal co-operation and assistance throughout the year. I am, Your obedient servant, A. TURNER. 3 SOCIAL CONDITIONS. Area 3,384 Population, 1934 (Registrar-General's Estimate) 61,692 Number of Inhabited Houses (end of 1934) 16,090 Rateable Value (1934) £737,950 Sum represented by a Penny Rate £2,973 EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR.

Deaths from diseases and accidents of pregnancy and child birth:— From sepsis 1 From other causes 1 Death-rate of Infants under one year of age:— All infants per 1,000 live births— Excluding Institution children 40.73 Including Institution children 58.99 Legitimate infants per 1,000 legitimate live births 46.85 Illegitimate infants per 1,000 illegitimate live births 344.83 Deaths from Measles (all ages) 1 Deaths from Whooping-cough (all ages) 13 Deaths from Diarrhoea (under 2 years of age) 4 4 POPULATION. The Registrar General estimates that at the 30th June, 1934, the population of the Borough was 61,692, which is an increase of 552 over the previous year. The natural increase or excess of live births over deaths was only 54, the lowest it has ever been, while the alteration in the boundaries which took place on the 1st April, 1934, added 150 persons to the population. The increase due to immigration into the Borough, if the Registrar General's estimate of the population is correct, was only 348. Surely this must be too few in view of the fact that the increase in the number of inhabited houses over the previous year was no less than 813. I am convinced that the population in June, 1934, was not less than 62,500. Owing to the alteration of the boundaries of the Borough on the Ist April, 1934, a second population, namely 61,679, has been allocated for calculating the birth and death rates. BIRTHS. The number of live births registered during 1934 was 712, an increase of 41 over the previous year. This gives a birth rate of 11.54 per 1000 of the population as compared with 10.97 in 1933. The birth rate for England and Wales was 14.8. Twenty-nine illegitimate births were registered as compared with 23 in 1933. The number of still births was 29, giving a rate of 39 per 1,000 of all births. DEATHS. The number of deaths registered in 1934 was 658, an increase of 66 over the previous year. This gives a crude death rate of 10.67 as compared with 9.7 in 1933. 5 The death rate for England and Wales was n.8. The higher death rate in 1934 was largely brought about by an increase in the number of deaths from cancer, heart disease and respiratory diseases. There were 13 deaths from whooping-cough—a large number when compared with 3 in 1933—-but 11 of these were of children from Nazareth House. INFANTILE MORTALITY. In 1934 there were 42 deaths of infants under one year of age and of these 13 belonged to Nazareth House. The infantile mortality rate for Finchley children is 40.7 per 1,000 births as compared with 26.8 in 1933. If Nazareth House children are included the rate is increased to 58.99 as compared with 40.2 in 1933. The rate for England and Wales was 59 and for London 67. The rise in the Infantile Mortality rate for 1934 is to be regretted but I am of the opinion that it is only temporary and accidental. The causes of deaths which chiefly account for the rise are premature birth—9 more than in 1933—enteritis—8 more than in 1933—and whooping-cough—4 more than in 1933. There were 10 deaths of illegitimate children under one year of age, and eight of these were institution children born outside Finchley, only two actually belonging to the district. This gives a mortality rate of 344.83 per 1,000 illegitimate births. % POOR LAW RELIEF. During the year 465 families were in receipt of outdoor relief, and the total amount expended on such relief was £6,484 12s. 9d. Nine hundred and thirty-one persons were admitted to the Wellhouse Hospital, and of these 138 were admitted to the Lying-in Ward. 6 GENERAL PROVISIONS OF HEALTH SERVICES IN THE AREA. Hospitals, i.

The Finchley Women Citizens' Association have instituted a scheme whereby families can have the services of a visiting nurse on the payment of an entrance fee of 5/- and an annual subscription of 10/-. The home nursing of cases of infectious disease is not undertaken by the Local Authority apart from what the health visitors are able to do in the course of their routine visits to the homes.

All the factories and workshops in the district have been inspected during the year and the various sanitary defects remedied as a consequence. Very little homework appears to be given out in the district. At some of the workshops the work done is for firms in London, but the total amount is not large. The following tables are on the lines of those issued by the Home Office.

Diphtheria. The incidence of diphtheria was a little higher in 1934 than in 1933, the numbers notified being 30 compared with 21, but lower than 1932 when the number was 47. All cases were removed to hospital. Although the majority were mild a few cases were very severe and there were two deaths. Antitoxin for the use of general practitioners is kept at the Public Health Department, but in 1934 there was little demand for it. Scarlet Fever. In 1934, 175 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified as compared with 158 in 1933 and 156 in 1932. One hundred and forty-three cases were removed to hospital. The disease continued to be mild in nature and in many instances presented 21 difficulty in diagnosis. The percentage of cases nursed at home is comparatively small and one finds that even in good class houses most doctors and parents alike prefer to have the case isolated in hospital. There can be no doubt that an infectious case nursed at home causes considerable dislocation in the household. One death was attributed to scarlet fever. This was the case of an adult female who contracted the disease on a holiday cruise and died from nephritis some considerable time afterwards. Enteric Fever. One case of enteric fever was notified but the diagnosis was not confirmed. Pneumonia. The number of deaths from this disease still exceeds the number of notifications and it is difficult to understand the value of notification at all. There were 46 deaths from this disease in 1934 and 35 notifications. Measles. There was a small epidemic of measles in 1934 and there was only one death. Whooping Cough. This disease was not very prevalent in 1934. There was a severe epidemic in Nazareth House where practically every infant contracted the disease and no less than eleven succumbed. Two other cases died in the Borough. 25 Influenza. Influenza was fairly prevalent in the early months of the year, but was not of a severe character. Fourteen deaths were attributed to this disease. Castro Enteritis. At the end of December, 1934, an outbreak of an obscure form of gastro-enteritis started among the children in Nazareth House. The symptoms were vomiting and slight diarrhoea with pale stools, rapid dehydration and collapse, with death in two to four days. The outbreak spread fairly rapidly. Out of 39 infants in one dormitory only 12 escaped the disease and of those attacked no less than 21 succumbed. The majority of the children in this institution are unwanted or deserted infants—nearly all illegitimate—and their physical condition is very poor indeed and undoubtedly this was the main reason for the high mortality. In dealing with this outbreak I received valuable advice and assistance from Dr. Sturdee of the Ministry of Health. Many specimens of vomited matter and excreta were submitted to bacteriological and chemical examination at the laboratories of the Ministry of Health but with negative results. Erysipelas. Nineteen cases were notified and there was one death. Smallpox. No case of Smallpox occurred in 1934. Vaccinations. No primary or re-vaccinations were performed by the Medical Officer of Health under the Public Health (Smallpox Prevention) Regulations, 1917. Immunisation. No children were immunised against Diphtheria in 1934. 26 Bacteriological Work. The bacteriological work for the district is carried out at the Joint Isolation Hospital and during 1934 the followingspecimens were dealt with:— Positive. Negative. Total.

During the year 250 copies of "Better Health" have been distributed monthly through the medium of the Infant Welfare Centres. I have received many reports as to the excellence of the material contained in ''Better Health," and I am satisfied that the small expenditure incurred in distributing this publication is amply justified. 28 NOTIFIABLE DISEASES DURING THE YEAR 1934.

Fourteen non-pulmonary cases were notified, consisting of 4 males and 10 females. There were 30 deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis, 13 males and 17 females, and 4 deaths from non-pulmonary tuberculosis, 2 males and 2 females. In 23.5 per cent. of the cases dying from tuberculosis no previous notification had been received. Dr. Dobson, the Tuberculosis Officer, has been good enough to supply me with the following figures:— Number of patients Diagnosed as non-tubercular 56 examined for first Diagnosed as tubercular 27 time during 1934 Undiagnosed and under observation 1 Number of tubercular cases transferred into district 7 Number of cases suffering from tuberculosis examined at the dispensary ing 1934 173 Number of cases under observation at the dispensary, etc., on 31/12/34 125 No cases were dealt with during the year under the Public Health (Prevention of Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1925, or the Public Health Act, 1925, Section 62. There were 30 deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis and 4 from other tubercular diseases, giving a death rate for all forms of tuberculosis of .55 per 1,000 of the population. 31 TUBERCULOSIS DURING THE YEAR 1934.

Although there has been no extension of the scheme during 1934, attendances at all the centres have increased and the work continues to expand in every direction. Once again 1 wish to acknowledge my appreciation of the large amount of useful work carried out by the ladies of the Voluntary Association. Infant Welfare Centres. In 1934, there were 14,192 attendances of children at the three centres as compared with 13,427 in 1933 and 12,073. in 1932. Children under one year of age made 8,249 attendances and children over one year made 5,943. Four hundred and forty-six children under one year attended for the first time during the year—a number equal to 62.64 per cent. of the notified live births. Thee average attendance of children at all sessions was 47 as compared with 44 in 1933 and 39 in 1932. Ante-Natal Clinic. One hundred and fifty-nine expectant mothers attended the Ante-natal Clinic in 1934 as compared with 122 in 1933, while the total attendances were 515 as compared with 430. A large number of women continue to attend the ante-natal clinics attached to the various maternity institutions. The number of mothers admitted to the Wellhouse Hospital was three more than in the previous year, while the number of admissions to other institutions has decreased and there has been a considerable increase in the number of confinements attended by the family doctor in the patients' own homes. No difficulty has been exeprienced in getting mothers, admitted to hospital for confinement. 33 Maternal Mortality. In 1934 there were two maternal deaths as compared with four in 1933. Both cases died in London Hospitals and neither had attended the Council's Ante-natal Clinic. The Maternal Mortality rate was 2.7 per 1,000 total births as compared with a rate of 4.41 for England and Wales. Puerperal Pyrexia and Puerperal Fever. Five cases of Puerperal Pyrexia were notified in 1934. Four cases were removed to hospital, and one was nursed at home. All recovered. One case of Puerperal Fever was notified. The patient was removed to hospital, and recovered. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. One case of Ophthalmia Neonatorum was notified in 1934. The patient was treated at St. Margaret's Special Hospital, and recovered without any impairment of vision. Home Visiting. During the year the Health Visitors made 4,296 visits In connection with Maternity and Child Welfare work, as compared with 2,606 in 1933. Dental Treatment. Expectant and nursing mothers who are in need of dental treatment are referred by the doctor at the Centres to the Council's dentist. Under the Council's scheme treatment is limited to extractions and fillings, but the Voluntary Association give assistance to necessitous mothers to enable them to obtain dentures. 34 The amount of work done shows a considerable increase on the previous year and before very long it will be necessary to have two sessions per week instead of one.

AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PERSONS ACT, 1932 At the beginning of the year there were on the register 14 mothers receiving 24 children, while at the end of the year there were 17 mothers receiving 27 children. Practically all the children attend the Infant Welfare Centres, but frequent home visits are also paid by the Health Visitors. No case called for any special action by the Council. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Chief Sanitary Inspector For the Year 1934 BOROUGH OF FINCHLEY ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Chief Sanitary Inspector For the Year 1934 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Finchley.

The premises have been inspected and the necessary action taken to ensure compliance with the byelaws. There are two cases of overcrowding; outstanding in houses let in lodging's, one being a case discovered during the year. It is satisfactory to report that several large houses at East Finchley, which until recently accommodated a large number of different families under somewhat unsatisfactory conditions, have now been converted into self-contained flats. 4(> Common Lodging Houses. There are no common lodging- houses in the district. Overcrowding. The following cases of overcrowding of one or more rooms in dwelling-houses were recorded, namely:— Number of cases of overcrowding recorded at the beginning of 1934:— In Houses let in Lodgings 1 In other dwelling-houses 32 Number of new cases of overcrowding recorded during 1934: In Houses let in Lodgings 1 In other dwelling-houses. 7 — 41 Number of cases of overcrowding abated during 1934: (a) by removal to a Council House:— From Houses let in Lodgings — From other dwelling-houses 7 (b) by removal to other premises:— From Houses let in Lodgings — From other dwelling-houses 8 (c) by re-arrangement of sleeping accommodation:— At Houses let in Lodgings — At other dwelling-houses 3 — 18 Number of cases of overcrowding outstanding at the end of the year 23 47 Sanitary Conveniences.

No formal applications were received from tenants during the year for certificates under the above Acts. A number of informal applications were, however, received and dealt with. Places of Public Entertainment. In acordance with the request of the Minister of Health contained in Circular 120, the cinemas, dance halls, and other places of public entertainment have been inspected, special attention being given to the condition and adequacy of the sanitary accommodation. Defects discovered as a result of these inspections were promptly remedied, and a report upon the premises was submitted to the Middlesex County Council, which is the licensing authority for the district of Finchley. The number of premises dealt with was 25. Premises Periodically Inspected. The following premises were visited periodically during the year, and any matters found requiring attention were dealt with:— Description of Premises No. in District. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops 61 Factories, Workshops and Workplaces (including Bakehouses and Restaurant Kitchens) 375 Fried Fish Shops 8 Ice Cream Premises 79 Places of Public Entertainment 25 Public House Conveniences. 26 Slaughterhouses 7 Shops re Food Supplies 199 780 49 Factory and Workshop Acts, 1901 and 1907. The total number of Factories, Workshops and Workplaces on the Register is 375. The trades carried on at the respective premises are as follows:— Bakehouses 40 Boot Polish Manufacturer 1 Boot Repairers. 43 Builders' Workshops 18 Cycle Makers or Repairers 5 Farriers and Blacksmiths 6 Glass Blowers. 1 General Engineers and Motor Engineers 53 Laundries 10 Monumental Masons 7 Motor Accessory Manufacturers. 4 Prepared Meat Factories 2 Printers and Printers' Accessories 17 Restaurant Kitchens 52 Sheet Metal Workers 2 Shop Fitters 2 Sports Accessory Manufacturers 3 Tailors and Dressmakers 36 Timber Merchants and Sawyers 16 Tyre Re-treading. 1 Upholsterers 13 Watch and Clock Repairers 7 Other Trades. 36 375 These premises have been visited from time to time, and as a result of action taken by the department the following works have been carried out:— W.C. apartments provided or reconstructed 1 New W.C. Pans provided 3 W.C.'s cleansed or repaired 19 50 Flushing" Cisterns repaired 2 New Sinks provided 1 New Sink Waste Pipes provided 3 Drains unstopped or repaired. 10 Yards cleansed or repaired 4 Floors repaired and/or cleansed 8 Dustbins provided 12 Workshops cleansed 71 Ventilation of Workshops provided. 3 Accumulations of refuse removed 3 Miscellaneous 15 Smoke Abatement. The Factory Chimneys in the district have been kept under observation, and steps have been taken to prevent, as far as possible, the occurrence of nuisance arising from the emission of black smoke. Rag Flock Acts, 1911 and 1928. A small quantity of rag flock is used in the district. The supply of this material is obtained from manufacturers who guarantee that it complies with the requirements of the above Acts. Rag flock is not manufactured or sold in the district. Exchange of Toys, etc., for Rags. It is not lawful for any person to distribute from any barrow, vehicle or premises used in connection with the business of a rag and bone merchant any article of food or any balloon or other toy. 51 In two instances recently particulars have been taken respecting persons who first delivered handbills and later in the day collected rags from children outside the Council's schools in exchange for such articles as pencils, pens, notebooks, combs, etc. By not using any form of barrow, vehicle or premises, and giving in exchange for rags articles other than food or toys, it would appear that the persons concerned did not commit an offence. Evasions of this character point to the need of an amendment of the existing law. The Rats and Mice Destruction Act, 1919. The above Act is administered by the Middlesex County Council. A number of complaints have been received in respect of premises alleged to be infested with rats. These complaints were immediately forwarded to Mr. A. Chudley, the Rats Destruction Officer for this district. The Inspection and Supervision of Food. Inspection of Meat. The inspection of meat is mainly controlled by the provisions of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924. These regulations provide that any person intending to slaughter an animal for human consumption must notify the local authority three hours before the time of slaughtering. These notices may be given at any time as the local authority are not empowered to regulate the hours of slaughter. In addition to the regular times fixed by certain butchers when slaughtering is to be carried out, 507 individual notifications of intention to slaughter were received. 52 As in former years, it has on many occasions proved somewhat difficult to arrange for the inspection of the carcases and organs of the animals slaughtered owing to the uncertain times when slaughtering takes place and the delivery after office hours of notices of intention to slaughter. With very few exceptions, however, the necessary inspections have been made. Ten certificates were issued to butchers at their request, certifying that certain meat had been inspected and found to be unfit for the food of man and destroyed. The total number of carcases of animals (including organs) inspected after slaughter during the year and the number and percentage found to be affected with tuberculosis are as follows:— No. Examined. Found to be tuberculous. Percentage. Beasts 173 24 13.872 Calves 173 7 4.046 Pigs 1,897 127 6.694 Sheep 9,058 — — 11,301 Diseased or Unsound Meat, etc., Destroyed. The following is a list of the diseased or unsound meat and other food which was detected by your inspectors and subsequently destroyed:— Tuberculosis. Bovines.

The number of private slaughterhouses in Finchley is as follows:— Type of Slaughterhouse Registered Nil Licensed. 7 The licence in respect of a slaughterhouse at North Finchley, which had been in use for many years, was not renewed for the year 1934. The licence of another old slaughterhouse in the same area became extinct consequent upon the demolition of the premises to clear the site for a new building scheme. 55 The number of visits paid to the seven slaughterhouses was 1,172. Most of these visits have been made for the purpose of inspecting" the carcases and organs of animals slaughtered for human consumption. Attention has alsobeen given to the condition, generally, of the slaughterhouses and steps have been taken to ensure compliance with the provisions of the byelaws with respect to these premises. The Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933. In accordance with the provisions of this Act, all animals, including sheep, which are slaughtered in a slaughter-house within the district must be stunned by means of a mechanically-operated instrument kept in proper repair, Steps have been taken to ensure that the provisions of the Act have been properly carried out and this method of slaughter has proved quite satisfactory. The number of persons licensed under the Act by the Corporation to slaughter animals was 21. Butchers' Shops. There are 47 butchers' shops in the district. All the shops are provided with glass fronts. These premises have been visited periodically and the provisions of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, which provide for the cleanliness of the premises, apparatus,utensils and vehicles, the precautions to be taken against the contamination of meat, the storage and removal of refuse, etc., have been, generally, well observed. Bakehouses. The number of bakehouses in the district is 40. During the year 4 new bakehouses were opened and 2 existing bakehouses were closed. 56 At 30 bakehouses motive power is used and the premises, therefore, constitute "factory bakehouses. The remaining 10 bakehouses are "workshops.1 The bakehouses have been visited by your inspectors and steps have been taken to cause them to be maintained in a proper sanitary condition. The periodical limewashing of these premises, as required by statute, has been carried out. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops. There are 61 dairies, cowsheds and milkshops in the district, and in addition 26 purveyors of milk whose premises are not in Finchley are registered for the purpose of retailing milk within the district. There were nine new registrations of milk purveyors during the year. The usual periodical inspection of all dairy premises has been maintained, and the provisions of the Milk and Dairies Order, 1926, with respect to the cleanliness of dairies and cowsheds, the protection of milk against infection and contamination, and the conveyance and distribution of milk have been generally well observed. The veterinary inspection of the cows kept in the district is carried out by the Middlesex County Council. The Milk (Special Designations) Order, 1923. Licences were granted by the Council in respect of designated milk for the year ended the 31st December, 1934, as follows:— Dealers' Licences to sell milk as "Certified" 6 „ „ „ „ „ „ "Grade A" 2 „ „ „ „ „ „ "Grade A Milk Pasteurised" 3 „ „ „ „ „ „ "Grade A culin Tested") 7 „ „ „ „ „ „ "Pasteurised" 10 57 Licence in respect of establishment at which "Grade A" ( Tuberculin Tested) Milk is bottled 1 Licences in respect of establishments in which the process of pasteurising milk is carried on 3 At the request of the Ministry of Health, ten samples of "Certified" milk and twelve samples of Grade A (Tuberculin Tested) Milk were obtained and delivered in London for bacteriological examination. One sample of "Certified" did not fully comply with the prescribed bacterial standards. Eight samples of "Grade A (Tuberculin Tested) Milk," one of "Grade A," one of "Grade A Pasteurised" and eleven of "Pasteurised" Milk were taken on behalf of the Council. With two exceptions, these samples were found upon examination to comply with the prescribed conditions. Ice Cream Premises. The number of ice cream premises on the register is 79. The premises were visited during the summer months. Coffee Stalls. The number of coffee stalls in the district is 10, compared with 13 in the previous year. Nine of these stalls are situated in the main roads. These stalls are visited at intervals and action is taken to secure the provision of a satisfactory water supply, suitable means of food storage, cleanliness of stalls and utensils and proper means for the storage and disposal of refuse. Offensive Trades—Fish Friers. The only offensive trade carried on in this district is that of a fish frier, this business being established at 8 premises. Steps have been taken by periodical visits to secure a reasonable compliance with the bye-laws. At one fish frier's premises at East Finchley, the old frying- apparatus was removed and a range of a more modern type installed in lieu thereof. 58 During the year three applications were received for the Council's consent to establish the trade of a fish frier with the following result:— 60, Totteridge Lane, Whetstone, N.20 Application refused. 23, The Promenade, Ballards Lane, N.3 ,, ,, 9, The Promenade, Ballards Lane, N.3 ,, ,, Came Licences. Sixteen applications were received under Section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1894, from tradesmen in the district for licences to deal in game. A licence was granted in each instance. The Shops Acts, 1912 to 1928. The number of shops on the register and the infringements dealt with are as follows:— Number of shops on Register at end of 1934 861 New additions to Register during 1934 55 Changes of occupancy recorded 54 Infringements recorded. 70 Storage of Petroleum. Petroleum Spirit is defined as Petroleum, which, when tested in a prescribed manner, gives off an inflammable vapour at a temperature less than 73 degrees Fahrenheit. Certain mixtures containing petroleum spirit, e.g., cellulose paint, rubber solution, etc., and also carbide of calcium come within the Petroleum Act. During the year applications for licences to keep petroleum spirit and carbide of calcium were received as follows:— Petroleum Spirit. No. of applications for licences 96 No. of applications granted 96 Quantity of petroleum spirit which may be kept in licensed stores 94,647 gallons 59 Carbide of Calcium. No. of applications for licences 5 No. of applications granted 5 Quantity of carbide of calcium which may be kept in licensed stores 588 pounds Licence fees paid during 1934 £56.11.3 The various licensed premises have been inspected from time to time, and a number of contraventions of the conditions attached to the licences have been dealt with. Staff. There were no changes in the sanitary staff during the year. It is with much pleasure that I take this opportunity to express my great appreciation of the invaluable help given by the assistant inspectors and the clerical staff, and again to acknowledge gratefully the kind co-operation of Dr. Turner, the Medical Officer of Health, and my colleagues in other departments. I am, Your obedient servant, E. J. FRANKLIN, Chief Sanitary Inspector.

I have the honour to submit my report on the work of the School Medical Service for the year 1934. Although there has been no material extension of the scheme of medical inspection and treatment, steady progress has been maintained in every direction. The health of the children as revealed at routine medical inspection continues to be very good and the number of defects discovered is very low. The work carried out at the Dental Clinic shows considerable expansion and the report prepared by the School Dental Officer is worthy of attention. Infectious diseases were below the average in incidence and on the whole were comparatively mild in character. Once again I wish to acknowledge the ready co-operation and assistance of Head Teachers and all members of your staff. I am, Your Obedient Servant, A. A. TURNER. School Medical Officer. 65 CO-ORDINATION WITH OTHER HEALTH SERVICES. Close co-operation exists between the Public Health Department and the School Medical Service; the Medical Officer of Health is also School Medical Officer, while the Assistant School Medical Officer and the three School Nurses also carry out the Maternity and Child Welfare work in the Borough. The School Nurses know most of the children before they are admitted to school, and they are also acquainted with their home circumstances. Medical Inspection. Routine Medical Inspection is carried out on the elementary school premises and the three age groups laid down by the Board of Education are dealt with, namely:— Five years olds, eight year olds, and twelve year olds. All new admissions to the schools which do not fall into any of these groups are also examined. "Special" children referred by parents, teachers or school nurses are examined in the schools or at the appropriate school clinic, while "re-inspections" are dealt with in the same manner In 1934 the total number of medical inspections was 3514. Findings of Medical Inspections. The number of defects, apart from dental defects and uncleanliness, found at routine medical inspection in the schools and at other inspections is set out in Table II. Of the 1,176 who were submitted to routine inspection within the prescribed groups 67 or 5.69% were found to be in need of medical treatment. This is a low figure and must be considered very satisfactory when compared with a percentage of 17.33 for England and Wales in 1933. (a) Malnutrition. At routine inspections 6 children out of a total of 1,339 examined were found to be in need of treatment for malnutrition, while at special inspections 7 children were found 66 to require treatment. In this district there has been no evidence of any deterioration in the nutrition of the school children during- recent years. (b) Uncleanliness. A very serious attempt is made to keep the standard of cleanliness as high as possible. New admissions to the schools take place on Mondays only and on these days the school nurses visit all schools and examine these children, who are allowed to remain in school only if they are perfectly clean, while those who are unclean are sent home and not admitted until their condition is satisfactory. All children in the schools are examined by the school nurses at the commencement of each term and the unsatisfactory ones are seen at frequent intervals. Children who have been excluded for uncleanliness are seen in school by the school nurses before they are allowed to return to their classes. The nurses paid an average of 75 visits to each school for uncleanliness inspections during the year; 18,363 inspections were made and 232 individual children were found not to comply with the rigid standard which is enforced. At routine medical inspection the heads of 74 or 5.53% of the children were found not to be entirely satisfactory while 3 or .22% had dirty bodies. (c) Minor Ailments and Skin Diseases. Few cases of minor ailments are found at routine inspection as these are sent to the school clinics by parents, teachers, and school nurses as soon as they are discovered. Two cases of impetigo were found at routine inspections, while at special inspections eight cases of ringworm of the body, 46 cases of impetigo, 13 cases of scabies, and 36 of other skin diseases were discovered. (d) Visual Defects and External Eye Disease. Twenty-eight or 2.09% of the children at routine inspection were found to be suffering from some fairly serious defect of vision while 44 others were found at special inspections. 67 A considerable number of children who had already been supplied with spectacles were referred to the School Oculist as a result of re-examination. In all 196 children were referred for refraction. Two cases of blepharitis and one case of conjunctivitis were found at routine inspection and at special inspections 15 cases of blepharitis and 9 of conjunctivitis. (e) Nose and Throat Defects. At routine medical inspection 12 children were found to be in need of surgical treatment for enlargement of the tonsils and adenoids, or both, while 13 were referred for observation. At special inspections 34 were referred for treatment and 30 for observation. (/) Ear Disease and Defective Hearing. As a result of routine and special examinations, 44 cases of discharging ears were referred for treatment. (g) Dental Defects. Five hundred and thirty-seven or 40.10% of the children were found to be suffering from dental decay, 8.289% having four or more teeth decayed, and 31.814% having less than four. (h) 0rthopcedic and Postural Defects. At routine inspection two cases of spinal curvature were found, one for observation and one for treatment, and one case of other forms of deformities was found for observation, while at special inspections one case of other forms of deformities was found requiring treatment. (i) Heart Disease and Rheumatism. At routine inspection one case of organic heart disease and one of functional heart disease were found. (7) Tuberculosis. One case of tuberculosis of the hip was found at routine inspections. 68 (k) Other Defects and Diseases. These form a very miscellaneous group and in all 235 cases were referred for treatment from routine and special inspections. Following up. There are three Health Visitors and School Nurses who devote approximately two-fifths of their time to school work. There is a whole-time Clinic Nurse who does the minor ailments and supervises the Dental Clinic, and there is also a whole-time Dental Attendant. Home visits are paid by the School Nurses in connection with the treatment of defects; to endeavour to get consents to dental treatment, in connection with uncleanliness cases, and to arrange for children to go to special schools. The following is a summary of the work done by the School Nurses during the year:— Visits to schools 876 Visits to clinics 319 Home visits 821 2,016 Number of examinations of children— heads, bodies, clothing, etc. 18,363 Medical Treatment. (a) Minor Ailments. The Clinic at Bourchier House is open every morning from 8.30 a.m. On the 1st January the Minor Ailments Clinic in North Finchley was transferred from the Congregational Hall to Summerside School and a session has been held weekly on Tuesday afternoons. On occasions the number of patients has been so large as to necessitate a second weekly session which has been held on Friday afternoons. Nine hundred and thirty-two children received treatment at these clinics during the year, making 6,760 attendances, as compared with 879 children making 8,172 attendances in 1933. 69 (h) Tonsils and Adenoids. Eighteen children were operated on for tonsils and adenoids at the Finchley Memorial Hospital. The arrangement whereby the children are detained in Hospital for two days following the operation is greatly appreciated by the parents, and it minimises the risk of haemorrhage and sepsis which are apt to occur when children are taken home immediately after operation. (c) Tuberculosis. All cases of tuberculosis occurring among school children are referred to the Tuberculosis Officer of the Middlesex County Council. (d) Skin Disease. The treatment of cases of skin disease is carried out at the Minor Ailments Clinics; 532 children were treated during the year. Ringworm of the Scalp. The schools were completely free from this disease during 1934. (e) External Eye Disease. Children suffering from external eye disease are treated at the Ophthalmic Clinic and at the Minor Ailments Clinics; 96 children were treated during the year. (f) Vision. The Ophthalmic Surgeon attends one session per week at the Clinic at the Martin School and examines all children suffering from defects of vision or other eye conditions referred to him. During 1934, 196 children were referred for examination; 171 were submitted to refraction—spectacles were prescribed in 172 cases and 152 actually obtained spectacles. In 20 of these cases the parents were unable to pay the whole cost of the spectacles and the Children's Care Committee subscribed varying sums towards the purchase. 70 (g) Ear Disease and Heaving. Children suffering from ear discharge and defective hearing- are dealt with at the Minor Ailments Clinic at Bourchier House. During the year 115 children were treated. (h) Dental Defects. A whole-time Dental Surgeon is employed. Ten sessions per week are devoted to the inspection and treatment of school children, and one session to the inspection and treatment of Maternity and Child Welfare cases. I am indebted to Mr. C. R. Wilshaw, H.D.D. (Edin), L.D.S. (Eng), the School Dental Officer, for the following report on the dental scheme. DENTAL REPORT, 1934. The Dental Scheme, which embodies regular dental inspection and remedying of defects, is an important factor contributing to the health of the school children of Finchley. The following is an outline of the procedure adopted. Inspections and Consents to Treatment. Inspections are carried out annually at the schools, and parents are invited by notices to be present. As may be expected it is the parents of the younger children that most usually attend. The parents that attend are informed of the treatment required; if they wish their child to be treated by their private practitioner they are advised to make the necessary visit without delay, or, if they desire the treatment to be undertaken at the clinic, they are invited to sign the consent form. The details of treatment required are recorded at the time of inspection, and are indicated on the consent form that is sent to the parents of each child requiring treatment. Treatment appointments are sent to all who desire treatment at the clinic as soon as possible after the return of the form appropriately signed to prevent interest waning to indifference. 71 Following up. All who do not return the form, and thereby do not disclose their intention, are home-visited in order to ascertain whether the child is receiving treatment elsewhere and, if not, to endeavour to persuade the parent of its importance and to repeat the invitation to treatment at the clinic. Unfortunately, the statement that the child is going to a private dentist is often no more than just the setting up of a barrier against further persuasion on the part of the staff. The child ultimately has to be taken to a dentist, but then, alas, the dentist is usually afforded the opportunity of doing no more than removing the aching tooth. The work of following up will become increasingly difficult as the irreducible minimum is approached. On the other hand a very encouraging feature is provided by the co-operation and encouragement by many teachers in promoting attendance. No school dental service can succeed without the closest co-operation on the part of the teachers, and in this respect Finchley is largely fortunate. The value of sensible encouragement to the children on the part of parents and teachers cannot be easily over-estimated, as dentistry from the patient's. viewpoint is never entrancing. Mere bribes tend to arouse suspicion which results in an attitude of mistrust or hostility. Treatment. Treatment, which has as its object the production and maintenance of maximum dental efficiency, is carried out at Bourchier House, Oak Lane, where the children attend by appointment at quarter-hourly intervals. As far as is practicable all fillings are completed for the child before any necessary extractions are made. This course is adopted because experience has shown that in many cases where extractions have been made on the first visit, the child does not return to have the saveable teeth filled. Thus, the latter policy, lends itself to the loss of would-be saveable teeth. Treatment of a conservative nature is aimed at, greatest stress being laid on the permanent dentition, and every effort is made to discover defects at their earliest manifestation. This inevitably makes the number referred for treatment correspondingly high and in 1934 was 81.3% of those inspected. That such a policy is a sound one may be ascertained from the number of teeth that were saved. The ratio of extractions to fillings in permanent teeth in Finchley for the year under review is 1:5.72, whereas the average ratio for all areas (1933 figures) is 1:2. The figures include extractions for irregularities. Orthodontia. No regulation by appliance is undertaken at the clinic. Where, however, the irregularity is caused or threatened by overcrowding, the condition is relieved by extraction, and many good results are obtained in this way. There are, nevertheless, a considerable number of irregular dentitions that can only be treated by appliance. Parents in these cases are advised to attend their private practitioner or, failing that, to attend one of the Dental Hospitals. Many of these are unable to follow this advice because of the expense incurred by the frequent visits which the effective operation of an orthodontic appliance involves. Regrettable as this is, it would be unwise to attempt regulation by appliance at the clinic, without additional assistance, because the surgery time spent in so doing would be at the expense of the more essential and universally needed conservative work. Root Canals. Root canals are only treated at the clinic in cases of incisor teeth—usually those devitalised by an accidental blow which fractures the tooth. These are preserved that the space and root may be retained in a healthy condition for subsequent crowning. Silver Nitrate. The application of silver nitrate is not generally resorted to, but in selected shallow cavities, where the arrest of caries may reasonably be expected to occur, silver nitrate is used. Specials. The special cases are only so in the sense that they are not routine. They consist of widely divergent types and include those that have refused treatment at routine inspec- 73 tion, those that accept by form but fail to keep their appointments, those that consider attendance every second or third year should be sufficient, those that have attended and have since developed some noticeable defect, and finally, children of the really likeable type of parents who insist that the dentist should assist away the wavering temporary tooth and give his opinion and blessing on each successive erupting tooth. Children whose parents have declined treatment in the past are allowed re-entry to the scheme at any time providing they consent to all necessary treatment, and any teeth requiring fillings are filled before extractions are made, as in routine cases. Anaesthetics. General anaesthetics are administered by a School Medical Officer who attends for that purpose at special sessions. No extractions of any kind are performed without the use of either a general or local anaesthetic. The details of the year's work are set out on pages 74, 735 and 95. At the routine inspection 3,330 children were inspected, and 2707 or 81.29% were found to require treatment. Of the 2707 who required treatment, 1658 or 61.25% actually received treatment at the Dental Clinic. 25 children were re-inspected, and all received treatment. 534 Special Cases were seen by the Dentist at the request of parents or teachers, and 431 of these were treated. The work carried out by the Dentist during the year is set out in the following table :— 1933 1934 Number of children inspected and re-inspected 4462 3889 Number of children treated 1908 2089 Number of attendances at Dental Clinic 2879 3650 Number of fillings 1301 3331 Number of extractions 1884 3958 Number of other operations 1059 198 Number of general anaesthetics 504 789 74 The following table shows the percentage of the children in each school who were found to require treatment, the percentage of these children requiring treatment who actually received treatment at the Dental Clinic, and the percentage stated to be receiving private treatment.

The charge is 1/- for each child treated. At the Minor Ailments Clinic an endeavour is made to collect 3d. a week for each child attending, but treatment is never withheld on account of inability to pay. Contributions for the operative treatment of tonsils and adenoids are collected bv the School Nurses. Infectious Diseases. All of the common infectious diseases showed an increase over the previous year when they had reached a record low level, but at no time was there a real epidemic of any particular disease. The following list gives the number of cases which were brought to the notice of the School Medical Officer for the past three years. 1932 1933 1934 Chicken-pox 146 1 48 Diphtheria 20 5 17 Measles 365 0 97 Mumps 3 13 36 Scarlet Fever 64 54 76 Whooping Cough 138 7 75 736 80 349 76 Exclusion of School Children on Account of Infectious Disease.

N.B.—These periods may be modified by the medical practitioner in attendance or by the Medical Officer of Health, but in such oases a special certificate will be sent to the Head Teacher from the Education Office. 77 Open-Air Education. No organised scheme of open-air education exists in the district. In a few of the schools, classes are conducted in the playgrounds during the summer months, and occasional school journeys are undertaken. No school camps have been held. Four places, two for boys and two for girls, are reserved by the Education Committee at the Russell Cotes School of Recovery, Parkstone. During the year 31 children were sent to Parkstone, and without exception, their health was greatly improved. Two places are also reserved, during the winter months, at the Children's Hostel, Collington Manor, Bexhill-on-sea. One girl was sent there for a period of twelve weeks, and four boys and two girls for a period of six weeks. Physical Training. No direct control over physical training is exercised by the School Medical Officer, but Head Teachers refer for examination any children who appear to them to be unfit to take part in the games and exercises practised in the various schools. During the year, in conjunction with the Boroughs of Hornsey, Tottenham and Wood Green, a male and a female organiser have been appointed, a step which should lead to co-ordination of the scheme of physical training throughout the schools in the Borough. Provision of Meals. No meals are provided by the Education Committee at any of the elementary schools. 78 Provision of Milk, The scheme of the Milk Marketing Board for supplying milk to school children came into force on the 1st October, 1934, and replaced the scheme of the National Milk Publicity Council which had been working for some years. Under the new scheme the price of milk was reduced from one penny to one halfpenny per bottle of one third of a pint. A condition of the scheme is that the source and quality of the milk must be approved by the Medical Officer of Health. In Finchley, the whole of the milk now supplied to the children is pasteurized and therefore can be considered to be safe. Much credit is due to the Head Teachers for the enthusiasm with which they have entered into the working of the scheme which undoubtedly entails a considerable amount of extra work. There can be no doubt that from the health point of view the scheme is excellent and few parents should miss this opportunity of providing their children with the best of all foods at so little cost. It is satisfactory to know that by the end of the year more than 70% of the children were taking advantage of the scheme. School Baths. The Council's baths in Squires Lane are available for the use of the children of all the elementary schools, and during the year 20,090 attendances were made by 1,602 children. Co-operation of Parents. Parents are invited to be present when their children are being examined at routine inspections, and the interest that is taken in medical inspection is shown by the following table, which gives the percentage of parents attending during the last six vears. 79 Co-operation of Teachers. The closest co-operation exists between the Teachers and the School Medical Service, and in many instances the Teachers have been instrumental in persuading parents to obtain the treatment for their children which has been recommended by the School Medical Officer. Many children are referred by Head Teachers for special examination and children found to be suffering from minor ailments are sent to the school clinics at the earliest opportunity. Co-operation of School Attendance Officers. Weekly lists are prepared by the School Attendance Department of all children absent from school on account of illness, and a weekly list of all children who enter or leave school is submitted to the School Medical Officer. The names of all children excluded from school by the School Medical Officer are notified forthwith to the Attendance Department. The Attendance Officers also inform the School Medical Officer of any children in their districts who are suspected to be physically or mentally defective and thus give valuable assistance in drawing attention to children who might otherwise escape medical supervision. Co-operation of Voluntary Bodies. During the year the Children's Care Committee sent 66 children to Bexhill for a period of one week, and in 20 cases assistance was granted in the purchase of spectacles. Percentage of Parents Attending. 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 73.6% 76.2% 72.9% 72.4% 73.2% 69.23% 80 Blind, Deaf, Defective and Epileptic Children. Every effort is made to ascertain children suffering from "special" defects and it is very unlikely that any are missed. Physically defective children are few, and so far it has not been found necessary to establish an Orthopaedic Clinic in the Borough, but arrangements have been made whereby the Education Committee assume responsibility for the maintenance in the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital of any cripple child recommended for admission by the School Medical Officer. No difficulty has been experienced in placing blind, deaf and epileptic children in certified special schools. Seventeen mentally defective children were in attendance at the Joint Special School situated within the area at the end of the year. (b) There are two feeble-minded children not in attendance at the Special School, but these are receiving private tuition and are kept under supervision. (c) The Education Authority has no Special Schools. When feeble-minded children leave the Joint Special School at the age of 16 they are taken over by the County Council. Nursery Schools. No nursery schools have been established in the district. Secondary Schools. The School Medical Officer conducts the medical inspection in the three Secondary Schools on behalf of the Middlesex County Council. This arrangement has the advantage of co-ordinating the work in the Secondary Schools with that in the Elementary Schools. 665 pupils were examined during the year. 81 Continuation Schools. There are no Continuation Schools in the district. Employment of Children and Young Persons. (1) The children employed in Finchley are mostly engaged in the distribution of milk and newspapers. The conditions of employment have been satisfactory and in no instance has a child been found to have suffered in health owing to such employment. (2) All children are referred to the School Medical Officer for examination prior to their commencing work. 19 children were examined during the year, and one was unfit for employment. No young persons have been referred to the School Medical Officer during the year. Special Inquiries. No special inquiries have been conducted during the year. Miscellaneous. All school teachers appointed by the Education Committee are examined by the School Medical Officer before they take up their duties. During the year no candidate has been rejected on medical grounds. 82 STATISTICAL TABLES for the Year 1934 83 TABLE I. Return of Medical Inspections. A.—Routine Medical Inspections.
