URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL OF CHISLEHURST AND SIDCUP. To the CHAIRMAN and MEMBERS of the COUNCIL. Ladies and Gentlemen, It is my duty and privilege to submit to you my second Annual Report and the sixteenth such report since Chislehurst & Sidcup became an Urban District in 1934. On January 1st, 1949, Dr. Carter-Locke was appointed as my Deputy, giving 50 per cent. of his time to Area duties. As the Members know, the County Council terminated, on December 31st, an agreement whereby 10 per cent. of my time as Medical Officer of Health to the combined three Authorities, Bromley, Chislehurst & Sidcup, and Orpington was lent to the County Council for duties as Area Medical Officer to Area No. 7, which comprises the above three authorities, together with Beckenham and Penge. In addition to this 10 per cent., a—further 50 per cent. of Dr. CarterLocke's time was likewise allocated. These Area appointments were replaced by a whole-time Assistant County Medical Officer who now acts as Area Medical Officer for both Area No. 6 and Area No. 7. This action by the County Council breaks the link between the environmental services of the Local Authorities and the personal Health Services, a cleavage which, in my view, is unwise and the effect of which must be left to the judgment of the future. To turn to a matter on which I focused your attention last year, viz., the hygienic preparation and handling of food-stuffs. In this connection there have been two important developments during the past year. Firstly, your Council has decided to adopt the Model Byelaws re the handling, wrapping and delivery of food and the sale of food in the open air. These Byelaws should be of considerable assistance in ensuring a cleaner food supply, particularly as the general public are now becoming very conscious of the importance of such measures and will, no doubt, co-operate with the Department in seeing that the Byelaws are enforced. Secondly, Mr. Allen and the Sanitary Inspectors have now completed their survey of kitchens, cafes, restaurants, etc., where food is prepared for communal feeding. Beneficial results should certainly accrue from their advice in view of the fact that such excellent co-operation was received from the traders concerned. 3 I should like to draw your attention to some of the outstanding tacts which emerge from a study of the vital statistics for the area. (Figures in brackets refer to 1948). Population. The total population for Chislehurst & Sidcup 73,850 Civilian population (upon which Birth and Death rates and Infectious Disease rates are calculated) 73,510 Death Rate. 7.9 of the Civilian population (9.1). Birth Rate. 15.8 of the Civilian population (16.4). Infant Mortality Rate. 19 (16.7). Infectious Diseases. The most notable features about the infectious disease notifications were the number of cases of infantile paralysis, mostly of a very mild type, and the marked increase of Tuberculosis Notifications, which bring the Tuberculosis Register of cases to nearly a thousand. This does not necessarily mean an increase of incidence, but is due in the main to the transfer of cases to new housing estates and to the greater facilities for early diagnosis—greater attention is necessary for adequate supervision of those cases nursed at home. Once again I feel it incumbent on me to draw attention to the inadequate provision for institutional care of the aged. There is a serious lack of beds for the aged sick, a responsibility which rests with Hospital Board*. There is need, too, in North-West Kent, for institutional care of the aged infirm, a responsibility of the Kent County Council. The problem is an ever-increasing one, the -rate of provision of beds is falling far behind the rate of increase of need. Were it not for the activity of voluntary bodies who are doing invaluable work, worthy of your support, and, if necessary, financial help, the state of affairs would, indeed, be serious The supply of Domestic Help for the home care of the aged is limited to domestic service, and workers are not permitted to act as "sitters in." Domestic Help can only be provided for the period necessary for domestic work. The "Meals on Wheels" service is coming into increasing use and the visiting of the lonely aged offers a very useful scope for voluntary effort. The next census, which will be taken in 1951, should give us some valuable facts and figures about the extent of this problem and it should then be possible to consider further ways and means of overcoming it. It 4 seems paradoxical that our measures for the health of the country have been so successful that, by increasing the expectation of life to such an extent, we have created another problem. In accordance with my procedure of last year, I have divided the report into the following sections:— Section A. Social Conditions of the Area, including Vital Statistics. „ B. Summary of Health Services. „ C. Sanitary and Environmental Circumstances. „ D. Housing. „ E. Food Protection. „ F. Infectious Diseases. Much of the statistical matter is this report is the work of Mr. Allen, your Chief Sanitary Inspector, whose ability and efficiency is so well known to you and to the public of Chislehurst and Sidcup. The support given us by the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee has been a great aid to the Department in its efforts to carry out your wishes and to promote and improve the health and the welfare of the District. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, K. E. TAPPER, Medical Officer of Health. 5 SECTION A. SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA The Urban District of Chislehurst and Sidcup, comprising 8,957 acres, was formed in 1934, and now has a total population of 73,850— approximately 8 persons per acre, which is an indication of the open nature of the district. There are 24 parks and open spaces, comprising some 306 acres. The district is bordered on the North by Bexley, and on the South by Orpington, on the West by Bromley and on the East by Dartford. The main administrative centre is picturesquely situated at Sidcup Place and is easily accessible. At the present time, some branches of the Council's activities are conducted from centres remote from the main Council Offices, although consideration continues to be given to the question of centralising all offices at Sidcup Place. Summary of Vital and Other Statistics. Area (in acres) 8,957 Registrar General's estimate of population (mid-year, 1949):— Civilian 73,510 Total 73,850 Number of valuation assessments of habitable premises at the close of the year (approx.) 22,500 Rateable Value (31st March, 1950) £632,516 Product of a Penny Rate for the year ending 31st March, 1950 £2,625 Live Births. Birth Rate, 15.8 per 1,000 population. Total Male Female Legitimate 1,113 556 557 Illegitimate 46 19 27 1,159 575 584 Stillbirths. Stillbirth Rate, 17.8 per 1,000 live and still births. Total Male Female Legitimate 20 11 9 Illegitimate 1 1 — 21 12 9 Deaths. Death Rate, 7.9 per 1,000 population. Total Male Female 582 298 284 Deaths from Puerperal Causes. Maternal Mortality Rate, 2.6 per 1,000 live births. Puerperal Sepsis 0 Other Maternal Causes 3 6 Deaths of Infants under one year of age. Total Male Female Infant Mortality Rate, 19 per 1,000 live births. Legitimate 20 10 10 Illegitimate 2 2 — 22 12 10 Death Rates of Infants under one year of age. All infants per 1,000 live births 19 Legitimate death rate per 1,000 legitimate live births 18 Illegitimate death rate per 1,000 illegitimate live births 43.5 Population. The Registrar General's figures show the population at mid-year 1949 to be 73,850, which equals approximately 8.2 persons per acre. This figure includes 340 non-civilians, i.e., men and women in the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force. It is now 20 years since the last census; the next is due to be taken in 1951, when full particulars of the living circumstances of the population will be defined and declared. With the development of St. Paul's Cray L.C.C. estate, the above mid-year population is already far exceeded and is indicative of the progress in population which is likely to continue for many years. This fact is very closely.allied with the question of the future of truly local government. Births. The Registrar General's figures, after correction for inward and outward transfers, give a total of 1,159, of which 46 were illegitimate. In addition to these live births, 21 pregnancies ended in stillbirths. There are no available figures to indicate pregnancies which ended in abortion. The live births give a birth rate of 15.8 per 1,000 population, a fall of .6 per 1,000 on the previous year and of 1.6 per 1,000 on the average rate since 1934. I regret I am unable to indicate the number of births in Hospitals compared with home and Nursing Home confinements. The stability of the birth rate in the region of 16 per 1,000 population is a reasonable figure on which to base the requirements of midwives and maternity beds in Nursing Homes and in Hospital. Illegitimate Births. The illegitimate birth rate for 1,000 births for 1949 was 40 compared with 35 in the previous year. This figure appears to be stabilised after years of war. 7 Stillbirths. The stillbirth rate for the year was 17.8 per 1,000 births, which is an improvement on the rate of 23.4 of the previous year and is a further decline in the average over the past 14 years. Deaths. Five hundred and eighty-two persons resident in Chislehurst and Sidcup died in 1949—a death rate equivalent to 7.9 per 1,000 population—one per 1,000 less than the previous year and 1.5 per 1,000 less than the average since 1934. Compared with the Death Rate of England and Wales of 11.7, the expectation of life in Chislehurst & Sidcup is a good one. I would not, however, like it said that the good health of Chislehurst & Sidcup is indicated by its low death rate, for the use of death rates as an indication of good health is outmoded. Of far more importance to the Medical Officer of Health would be a return of sickness and incapacity owing to sickness. Below I have given the number of deaths under each cause of death: there were 182 deaths from heart and other vascular diseases, 102 deaths from cancer, while 75 died of cerebral hæmorrhage. These are the main causes of death and with an ageing population, likely to remain so. There were 7 deaths from road traffic accidents and 11 from other violent causes. There were 4 suicides. There were no maternal deaths from puerperal sepsis, but three mothers died in childbirth. Thirty patients died from tuberculosis of the respiratory system and 5 others from other forms of tuberculosis. This is 10 less than the previous year. Except for 2 cases of whooping cough deaths and one from infantile paralysis, there were no deaths from any other notifiable infectious disease. There was a fall in the deaths from gastric and duodenal ulcers and other digestive diseases—13 compared with 24 for the year 1948.

SUMMARY OF HEALTH SERVICES The summary that follows gives an indication of the Health Services rendered by the District Council, the County Council and the Hospital Boards. I have not, however, included the invaluable Service to the health of the district rendered by voluntary organisations such as the Chislehurst and Sidcup Care Committee (Tuberculosis), the British Red Cross Society and St. John Ambulance Brigade, the North West Kent Council of Social Service, the W.V.S. and the Chislehurst and Sidcup Old People's Welfare Committee. 1. Health Services Rendered by the Council. Sanitary and Environmental Services. These, which are the main services of your Health Department, have been reported upon in Sections C. D. E. and F. A summary of the year's work is in the Appendix. Inspection of Nursing Homes. This service has been delegated to your council by the County Council. The six Nursing Homes in the area provide the following accommodation:— Number of maternity beds 16 Number of other beds 27 Number of patients received during the year 196 Eleven inspections were carried out at these Homes during the course of the year, and there were no serious infringements of the Local Bye-Laws. Public Mortuary. During the year, structural alterations were completed giving improved storage of some six bodies at low temperatures and for viewing of bodies where required for identification. Sixty-eight bodies were received, on 26 of which inquests were held. 2. Services Rendered by Hospital Boards. There are three hospitals in Chislehurst & Sidcup—Queen Mary's Hospital with 510 beds, Cray Valley Hospital with 31 beds, and Sidcup Cottage Hospital with 14 beds, giving a total of 555 hospital beds available in the district. They form part of the Sidcup and Swanley Hospital Group of the S.E. London Region. I am led to understand that there are only five maternity beds provided by this Hospital Board but that further provision is under active consideration. 9 In addition to these Hospitals, six blocks of Grove Park Hospital lie within the Chislehurst & Sidcup Urban District. One of these blocks is given over to Mass Radiography. In the remaining five blocks there are 240 beds given over to cases of tuberculosis. They form part of the Woolwich Hospital Group. 3. Services Rendered by the County Council. Health Visiting. The County Council employ ten Health Visitors to work in Chislehurst & Sidcup. Their functions include advising expectant , and nursing mothers and on the case of young children in the home. They also undertake duties in connection with the School Health Services, immunisation, vaccination, etc. Midwifery (Domiciliary). There are eight midwives engaged whole time on domiciliary midwifery. They are engaged either by the patient directly, or through the latter's doctor, and act either as midwives or maternity nurses. Home Nursing Service. There are ten Home Nurses in the Chislehurst & Sidcup area who attend patients in their own homes on certification of the need by a doctor. Domestic Help Service. At the year's end there were 80 Domestic Helps employed. The total number of cases assisted during the year was 600, Child Welfare Centres. CHISLEHURST: The Willows, Red Hill FOOTSCRAY: W.

SANITARY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES WATER There was no need to extend new sources of public water supply in the Council's area during 1949, but service mains were necessarily laid on the L.C.C. estate at St. Paul's Cray. I am indebted to the Director of Water Examination, Metropolitan Water Board—Lt.-Col. E. F. W. Mackenzie, for the following statement. "The supply to the district of Chislehurst & Sidcup has been adequate at all times in 1949 and is derived from the following seven wells: Orpington, North Orpington, Shortlands, Eynsford, Bexley, Wilmington and Darenth, together with Thames-derived filtered water via Shortlands. Bacteriological analyses of these sources of supply are made at least five times a week and consistently satisfactory results have been obtained. Chemical analyses of the supplies are made at frequent intervals. All supplies are treated with chlorine on the works, but any excess remaining after a period of contact is removed completely or reduced to an amount that will not be perceptible to consumers. Tanks have been installed at North Orpington, Wilmington and Bexley to ensure an adequate contact of chlorine with the water ; tanks at other well stations are planned or are in the course of construction. All new and repaired mains are disinfected with chlorine before being restored to supply and samples of water from them are analysed to establish that it is up to the normal standard of quality expected in the distribution system. None of the supplies is plumbo-solvent. We have no information with regard to the proportion of the total number of dwelling houses and population in Chislehurst & Sidcup which are supplied from the above-mentioned sources. All the houses are supplied directly and not by means of stand-pipes." Given in appendix 5 are the results of chemical and bacteriological analyses of the various supplies to Chislehurst & Sidcup during 1949. There are 18 isolated premises where water supply is dependent upon well supply. Of these 18, 5 are serving 10 dwelling houses. They are kept under supervision and the 31 samples taken for chemical analysis and 50 for bacteriological analysis, proved satisfactory. 13 DRAINAGE. There have been no extensive alterations to the main drainage service of the West Kent Sewerage Board. Of the 21,158 residential premises, some 481 are drained to cesspools. I am submitting a tabulation giving the five main geographical groups of cesspool drainage. Group A. Premises. Residential Nonresidential Maidstone Road, Footscray 19 3 Group B. Barton Road 24 1 Honeyden Road 15 — North Cray Road 29 — Group C. Maidstone Road, Ruxley 116 — Group D. Sevenoaks Way 31 — Group E.

No. of Premises. Residential Non-P.esidential Lamorbey. Blackfen Road 8 Burnt Oak Lane – 1 Days Lane – 1 Hurst Road 1 1 Sidcup. Bexley Lane 1 Oxford Road – 1 Station Road 1 – Foots Cray. Church Road 1 – Palm Avenue 2 — North Cray. Birchwood Corner 24 — Bunkers Hill 6 — Old London Road 4 — Parsonage Lane 16 — St. Paul's Cray. Broomwood Road 4 – Chapmans Lane 15 – Cookham Lane 2 — Hockenden Lane 24 — Land Way 3 – Sandy Lane 11 — Sidcup By-Pass — 4 Trunks Alley 2 – Chislehurst. Botany Bay Lane 5 – Camden Grove 1 – Elmstead Lane 3 1 Hawkwood Lane 2 – Kemnal Road 1 – Old Station Hill 1 – Orpington Road 1 – Scadbury– 3 – Total 142 9 The matter of cesspool drainage is before the Local Authority and is receiving their active attention. In the main the subsoil is chalk, which makes a percolating cesspool a danger. 15 Rivers and Streams. Forty-eight inspections have been made during the year of rivers Quaggy, Cray and Shuttle. The Wincham Stream has been piped. The responsibility for all such streams and watercourses has now been passed to the Kent River Board (to take effect as from 1st April, 1950). Factories and Workshops. There are 162 premises in the register as listed in Appendix 2 Two hundred and eighty-four visits of inspection were made by the Sanitary Inspectors; there were 56 cases where defects, mainly of cleanliness and unsuitable lavatory accommodation were found. There is a need, from the aspect of the health of the worker, for a closer link between the Health Department of the Local District Council and the factory. The physical and mental environment in which the worker lives has an important effect upon the output of the worker, in the factory, in the workshop and in the office. There is here a field of work in which, given the power, the Health Committee of the Local Council could well be interested. Outworkers. There are no firms in Chislehurst & Sidcup employing outworkers. Visits, however, are paid in connection with outworkers in the district employed by firms outside the district. Shops Acts. There are 650 shops situated in the District. During the year 325 inspections and observations of shops were made, and 25 Informal Notices were served in connection with the Shops Acts. Ventilation. It was not found necessary to require improvement to the ventilation at any shop premises. Temperature. The provision of facilities to ensure that a suitable and sufficient temperature could be maintained was required at one shop. Sanitary Conveniences. Sanitary accommodation and/or additional sanitary accommodation was provided in 11 shops. Lighting. It was found necessary to require better lighting in one shop. Washing Facilities. Proper washing facilities were provided in 14 shops. Facilities for Meals. In one case it was found necessary to require the provision of proper facilities for the taking of meals at the shop. 16 Seats for Female Assistants. In two cases a shopkeeper was required to provide seats for female assistants. Closing. No Closing Orders were made for shops in the District. The days of Early Closing generally observed are:— Wednesday.—Chislehurst and The Oval, Sidcup. Thursdays.—Remainder of the district. Hours. Action was taken in four cases. Records. It was found that 19 shopkeepers were not keeping, exhibiting, or providing the necessary Notices or Records, and in each case an appropriate letter was sent. Cleansing of Persons. The unit established at Chislehurst Caves for the purpose of the treatment of scabies and the cleansing of verminous persons was closed during the year and there has been no call for its re-opening. Bed Bugs. During the year 30 complaints were received of infestation of premises by bed bugs. The number of houses and/or their contents found to be infested was 23 (including 3 in the Council's possession). In suitable cases, and on the request of tenant and owner, the disinfestation of the premises and contents were simultaneously carried out by the Department. In all other cases the premises were disinfested by the owners, and the contents by the tenants. In all necessary cases bedding was steam disinfected by the Department. The usual method of disinfestation is to spray with D.D.T. fluid. Close supervision was made of premises which had been disinfested. and the tenants were given suitable advice and instructions on methods of prevention and destruction of vermin. Sanitary Inspection of Area. I have tabulated from Mr. Allen's report on the work of the Sanitary Inspectors a general summary of their work during the year— details appear in the Appendix. HOUSING. Number of Inspections, Public Health and Housing Acts 8,415 Number of Premises in which defects were found 760 Number of Informal Notices served 932 INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Inspections: 509 (including 229 to T.B. cases). 17 FOOD PREMISES. Inspections: 1,166. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. Inspections: 284. SHOPS ACTS. Inspections: 325. UNSOUND FOOD. Inspections: 414. RATS AND MICE. Inspections: 1,118. Rodent Control. One thousand one hundred and eighteen visits were made by District Sanitary Inspectors to premises in connection with rat infestation. Two hundred and sixty complaints were received and in 200 premises infestation was remedied. A whole-time rodent operative has been engaged since 1941. In addition to work carried out at owner's or occupier's expense in dealing with rodents on private property, he has also undertaken similar duties on the properties in the possession of the Council, including sewers. During the year he has made 4,141 visits in connection with the work of eradicating rodents. Sewers. Two 1 in 10 tests were made of sewer manholes, the results being:— 1st—Number manholes tested, 179 ; number found "no takes" by rats, 153. 2nd—Number manholes tested, 198 ; number found "no takes" by rats, 165. These results showed the sewers to be comparatively free from rat infestation. 18 SECTION D. HOUSING. There are in Chislehurst & Sidcup some 21,123 houses and flats, 12 farm houses and 23 Public Houses. The following tabulation has been supplied by the Housing Manager: — Prior to During 1949 1949 1. (a) No. of " permanent " dwellings built by L.A. 465 161 (b) No. of prefabricated dwellings built by L.A. 275 Nil (c) No. of dwellings held under requisition by L.A. including Squatters' Camps (22 requisitioned premises and huts released) 293 271 2. (a) No. of families occupying 1 (a) 465 161 (b) No. of families occupying 1 (b) 275 275 (c) No. of families occupying 1 (c) 458 431 3. Total No. of families rehoused during 1949 in (a) 156 (b) 27 (c) 59 4. No. of families on waiting list at 31 December, 1949: — Families requiring 5 bedrooms 1 Families requiring 4 bedrooms 64 Families requiring 3 bedrooms 418 „ Families requiring 2 bedrooms 652 Families requiring 1 bedroom 442 Old Age Pensioners 54 Applicants not yet married 37 1668 There are, of course, in addition to the above, the 913 houses already erected by the London County Council at St. Paul's Cray for the rehousing of London families. By agreement with the London County Council, 5 per cent, of the first lettings to applicants are nominated by the Council. There are also 35 houses and bungalows erected by private enterprise and 10 private houses were converted into flats during 1949. The main work of the department so far as housing matters are concerned is the maintenance of houses in a fit state for habitation. The age of houses is an important factor in the extent of the effort to be made by the Department. With the new housing programme still in arrears to meet the actual need of rehousing, there is no progress able to be made in the need to replace old houses by new, and unless progress is made in this direction in the coming years, there is a likelihood of the population being forced to live in substandard houses. 19 The following is a resume of the work carried out by the Sanitary Inspectors affecting private dwellings. No. of premises inspected 1,369 No. of visits 8,415 No. of premises with defects 760 No. of premises rendered fit 779 No. of informal notices 932 No. of formal notices 13 There were no clearance orders, demolition orders or individual "unfit" houses declared during 1949. Overcrowding. So far as is known, the overcrowding, as defined by the 1925 Housing Act, is shown in the table on following page. This overcrowding is based on the number of persons per room and does not take into consideration the far more important factors of kitchen, lavatory and washing accommodation which make for happy living. Movable Dwellings, Etc. There are two camps of pickers' huts in the District, which were used during the'year, and of which 15 inspections were made. Unsatis-, factory conditions continue to exist at Chalk Pit and Corkes Meadow, where there is an accumulation of movable dwellings. 20 • OVERCROWDING. 31st December, 1949.

INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD. The assistance and co-operation given to the Department by the Food Traders and retailers has been, throughout the year, all that one could desire. This working together in a united effort to provide clean food cannot but lead to success. While communal feeding continues to be common, there is always a risk of food poisoning outbreaks should there be any relaxation of personal hygiene of food handlers at any stage. During the year we received 13 cases notified as food poisoning which included two so-called " outbreaks" affecting seven persons. . In no case were we able to discover the causative organism, if any such organism existed. The difficulties of investigation are aggravated unless immediate notification is received and samples of suspected food available—even 12 hours' delay complicates the investigation. The regular routine inspections of food premises are carried out by the Inspectors and no less than 1,108 inspection visits were made during the year. Food and Drugs Act, 1948. One hundred and twenty-nine formal and 56 informal samples were taken under this Act. Details of these samples appear in the appendix and all samples proved to be genuine except: — Baking Powder.—Deficient of 20% of minimum amount carbon dioxide. Baking Powder.—Deficient of 17.5% minimum amount of carbon dioxide. Unsweetened Milk.—Sour smell and curdled on boiling. Acidity (0.8% as Lactic acid) excessive. Unfit for use. Milk (Jersey).—Deficient 23.75% minimum amount of fat. Milk (Jersey).—Deficient 15% minimum amount of fat. Sausages (Beef).—Deficient 14% minimum amount of meat. Sausage Meat.—Deficient 24% minimum amount of meat. Beef Sausages (formal).—Deficient 24% minimum amount of meat. Pasteurised Milk (informal).—Contained 5.7% added water. Inspection of Food Premises. During the year these premises were subject to routine inspection and a total of 1,108 visits were made to the following types of shops: — Butchers 191 Ice cream premises 158 Bakers 124 Greengrocers 146 Cafes, etc. 333 Other food-preparing Fishmongers 132 premises 29 22 MEAT INSPECTION Slaughterhouses. There is one licensed slaughterhouse in the district but there is no slaughtering of animals carried out. No carcases were condemned for tuberculosis or any other disease. Piggeries. Fourteen piggeries in the district were visited on 162 occasions, 17 defects were found and remedied. Bakehouses and Bakers' Shops. There are 11 bakehouses in the district to which 124 visits of inspection were made during the year—25 defects were remedied. Fishmongers. Fish frying is carried on at 14 premises ; 61 inspections were made, and 8 defects were found and remedied. Dairies and Cowsheds. Special attention was given to the 16 dairies, 54 visits were made and successful action taken to remedy 25 defects found. Ice-Cream. There are two premises registered for the manufacture of ice cream, and 90 registered for the sale or storage of ice cream ; 19 of these premises were registered during the year. Fifty samples were taken for bacteriological examination and no pathogenic organisms were found. The Methylene Blue tests resulted as follows: — Grade I 12 Grade III 8 Grade II 12 Grade IV 18 Grades beiow II can be said to be unsatisfactory. Restaurants, Hotels, Canteens, Etc. During the year 1949 a special survey was made of 31 ordinary restaurants and caf£s at which main meals are served, the survey recording 65 enquiry items in each case. To record a summary of these 65 items in this annual report would serve no useful purpose as they are mainly for use of the department in their routine work of inspection and for improvement. The main problem of proprietors appears to be the cramped space in which the restaurants have to work in preparing the meals, but even this cramping of space has been overcome in many cases by 23 good organisation by the management. Perhaps the outstanding defect is the unsatisfactory arrangements for the washing of hands of the employees and in only a few premises was there hand-washing with hot water facilities adjacent to the water-closet. Cloakroom accommodation is generally insufficient. The pre-cooking of food is not the general practice and where this practice is adopted only exceptionally was there no refrigeration. Extensive improvements are necessary in the dish washing arrangements, the sinkage is inadequate and the final high temperature rinsing arrangements are noted by their absence. These are just some of the defects noted in the survey— defects which the proprietors themselves are very anxious to abolish. Their difficulties are many and if I have recorded some adverse criticism it is merely to express a desire for greater perfection and safeguard. Unsound Food. 5 tons 0 cwts. 3 qrs. 4 lbs. of unsound food was surrended as unfit for human consumption and destroyed, or used where possible for animal food after suitable treatment. In Appendix X is a list of items of food affected. 24 SECTION F. INFECTIOUS DISEASES The following table gives a summary of infectious diseases notified during the year. No. of cases notified. Smallpox — Diphtheria 1 Scarlet Fever 196 Enteric Fever (including Paratyphoid) — Puerperal Pyrexia 5 Cerebro-Spinal Fever — Acute Poliomyelitis 26 Acute Polio encephalitis — Encephalitis Lethargica — Respiratory Tuberculosis M 54 F 32 Other forms of Tuberculosis M 5 F 4 Pneumonia 31 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 2 Whooping Cough 230 Measles 935 Erysipelas 16 Dysentery 2 Typhoid Fever 1 A practice has grown up recently since the passing of the Health Service Act whereby cases are admitted to hospital direct without notification to the Medical Officer of Health, thereby delaying any preventive action that may be necessary in the control of contacts. It is difficult to counteract this tendency. The continued absence of diphtheria in epidemic form is again noteworthy and is not entirely due to the Diphtheria Immunisation campaign. Records show that at least 36 per cent, of the children in Chislehurst and Sidcup under 15 years are not immunised. Scarlet Fever again continues high in incidence, 196 cases being notified, being 2.6 per 1,000 population compared with 1.62 for the whole country. It is, however, mild in character and free of complications. No severe case was reported or seen. Whooping Cough and Measles showed by far the highest incidence but, again, the infections were mild, although there were two deaths from whooping cough. What is applying to Chislehurst and Sidcup applies generally to the rest of the country. The increase in Tuberculosis Notification is due mainly to transfer of cases into new building estates and is a sign that the T.B. case is, fortunately, being better housed. The 28 cases of infantile paralysis are reported on more fully in the text that follows. 25 Scarlet Fever. On hundred and ninety-six cases were notified, 94 of which were home-nursed and 102 treated in hospital. This tendency to hospitalise mild scarlet fever is mainly due to the difficulties associated with the present housing conditions. Diphtheria. Diphtheria continues to be noted by its absence in epidemic form. Only one case was notified—2 other cases were not confirmed. The following table shows the immunisation state of children under 15 in Chislehurst and Sidcup which has been forwarded through the County Health npnartmpnt and I have added the births for the corresDondine year. year. It would appear that 64 per cent, have been successfully immunised: — Year of Birth 19 35 1936 1937 1938 1939 1940 1941 1942 '943 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 Total Births 367 808 380 802 403 995 406 1038 537 612 464 1018 469 885 862 1092 773 1075 1120 1152 612 1037 912 1412 989 1481 903 1197 100 1159 9.497 15,823 Whooping Cough. Two hundred and thirty cases were notified, giving a rate of 3.1 per 1,000 population. Five cases were admitted to hospital and there were two deaths. Whooping Cough immunisation is not practised and has not yet reached a stage of efficiency that can be safely commended. Tuberculosis. Ninety-five primary notifications of tuberculosis were received during the year, 86 of them being of the lungs and 9 other forms. The total number on the Tuberculosis Register at the year's end, so far as local records are concerned, was 913, which gives a rate per 1,000 population of 12.3. Infantile Paralysis. A recurrence of infantile paralysis during 1949 indicated a milder type and less extensive. The General Practitioners are active in the notification of " probable " cases. Twenty-six cases were notified and 2 others brought to my notice. Of these 28 cases, 14 were home nursed, 13 of which proved abortive and one with transient paralysis of the arm. Of the 14 cases admitted direct to Hospital, 7 proved abortive and of the 7 with paralysis, 2 were polio-encephalitis. The number of abortive cases gives indication of the difficulty of diagnosis in the early stages of the disease and although the notification of these cases inflates the incidence, the practice of notification of such cases is, in my view, a wise one. 26 There were no cases of lymphocytic chorio meningitis, which is a disease similar to infantile paralysis and which is due to a mouse urine virus. It is disturbing that there is little one can do to prevent the spread of this distressing disease. Every case notified is visited and general advice on the disease given, e.g., the exclusion of children from school and the exclusion of adult contacts when such contacts are employed in food production or handling, the importance of complete rest where contacts develop a " catarrhal illness," and the need for strict hygiene, both personal and environmental. While the cause of spread remains uncertain, the action of the Medical Officer of Health is limited except in the field of consultation with the general practictioners. 27 APPENDICES. 1 SANITARY INSPECTORS—INSPECTIONS AND COMPLAINTS. 2.
