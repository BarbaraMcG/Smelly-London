Health Department, Bidborough House, 38-50, Bidborough Street, W.C.I. June 1965. TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE LONDON BOROUGH OF CAMDEN. Mr .Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the final Annual Report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough of Hampstead during 1964. One of the uses of an Annual Report is to provide information in a set pattern which will allow comparison with similar information concerning previous years or concerning other areas. It is therefore necessary to delay the report until certain statistical information is available from the Registrar General and for this reason it was not possible to present the report until the Borough of Hampstead had ceased to exist as a local authority. It will be seen that for the first time the official estimate for the population exceeds 100,000. Infectious disease was again low and reflects the success which has been possible by modern methods of prevention and treatment. The main work of the department was concentrated on living conditions and in particular on the repair and improvement of houses. The powers given to the Council by the Housing Act 1961 to require improvements in houses in multiple occupation were used more widely than in previous years and many additional amenities were provided. Nevertheless the problem is a large one and is likely to occupy the London Borough of Camden for some years in the future. Reports on the various services and duties have been kept to a minimum because this is now mainly a matter of history. Where there has always been the greatest co-operation with the London County Council the services will undoubtedly be improved in Camden by the closer integration of staff such as health visitors and public health inspectors who visit the homes and are in direct touch with the public in their homes or working environment. In addition, the placing of the Health, Housing, Children's and Welfare Departments in one building can do nothing but good in improving the services in the new London Borough of Camden. 4. I am extremely grateful to all the members of the staff of the Public Health Department of Hampstead for their hard work and the loyal support which they have given to me during the past nine years. In particular, I should like to express my thanks to Mrs. Catherine Speechley, Public Health Inspector, who retired when the Borough amalgamated with Holborn and St.Pancras, and who showed such a very great interest in the welfare of the old people of Hampstead. My thanks are also due to the Town Clerk, the other Chief Officers and their staff for their ready assistance at all times. I am very grateful to Councillor Miss E.Beer, Chairman of the Public Health Committee and to the members of the Committee for their help and encouragement. I am quite sure that the progress in environmental health which has been achieved over the years in Hampstead will be continued in Camden under the direction of the Medical Officer of Health, Dr.Wilfrid G.Harding, and my thanks are due to him for the facilities which have been provided for the preparation of this report. I have the honour to be, Mr.Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, R.DUNCAN DEWAR. Associate Medical Officer of Health. 5. PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE.

The Mid-1964 estimate is based on the final results of the Census enumeration of the 23rd April, 1961 corrected for area of usual residence. Part of the increase in population is due to the excess of births over deaths, i.e. 897, but most must be accounted for by the amount of housing conversion that has taken place. Large single houses have been divided into flats and in some instances houses have been demolished and replaced by blocks of flats and housing estates. BIRTHS The birth rate of 18.0 per 1,000 population is a high one, but when the comparability factor of 0.64 is taken into account the adjusted birth rate which is used for comparison with other districts becomes 11.5. The number of illegitimate births, 284, showed an increase of 34 compared with the previous year and the percentage of illegitimate births increased from 14.3 in 1963 to 15.6 in 1964. The increase is possibly partly due to the number of unmarried mothers who come to London to have their babies, either because of the better facilities offered or because they wish to minimise the risk of publicity among their own friends and family. The number of still-births declined from 23 in 1963 to 17 in 1964# with a corresponding welcome fall from 13 to 9.3 in the rate of still-births per 1000 total births. INFANT MORTALITY. Twenty-nine children died under the age of 1 year, 20 of these died within the first week. The infant mortality rate was 15.9 compared with 17.2 in the previous year. 8. DEATHS. Deaths of Hampstead residents totalled 922, the lowest figure since 1954. The death rate per 1000 of the population was 9.1, the same as in 1954, and one must go back to 1910 to find a lower rate (8.6). The adjusted death rate, which allows for the age structure of the population, was 10.1 and this figure is also low compared with recent years. Rather unexpectedly deaths of persons under 25 years of age however were high in 1964 (54) compared with 1963 (41) but as the Registrar General attributed the increase to "Other defined and ill-defined diseases" no comment can be made on the reasons for the increase. Deaths over 65 fell from 672 in 1963 to 619 in 1964. Considering the total number of deaths was low, it is significant the number of cancer deaths remained at the average of the last few years, in fact deaths from cancer of the lungs were the highest since 1960. Deaths from heart and circulatory diseases, and diseases of the respiratory system, were low and were mainly responsible for the drop in the total number of deaths. The number of cases of suicide in 1964, 1963 and 1962 was 27, 28 and 26. This figure has indeed been fairly constant for many years. It is pleasing to record that deaths from accidents (23; including motor vehicle accidents, were the lowest since 1957. 9. INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. The total number of infectious diseases notified during 1964, excluding cases of measles, was 154, compared with 190 in 1963. The number of cases of measles notified was 327 or 410 less than in the previous year. Of the more serious infectious diseases I was able to report last year that for the first time for more than 20 years there were no cases of poliomyelitis in the Borough and I am very glad to report that there were no cases during 1964. It is also pleasing to note that as in the three previous years there were no cases of diphtheria. The two cases of typhoid fever were both contracted abroad and fortunately no secondary cases occurred here. The number of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis notified was 44 (27 male and 17 female). This figure compares with 54 in 1963 but it is still one more than in 1962. The number of cases of non-pulmonary tuberculosis was seven, which is three less than in the previous year. The figures for all infectious diseases are in general very satisfactory. Infectious diseases are of course spread from person to person and immunisation not only protects the person immunised but also prevents the spread from that person to others. In addition modern methods of treatment frequently reduce the period during which a person is infectious to others. It is hoped that the new vaccine against measles will prove to be as effective as the vaccines against smallpox, diphtheria and poliomyelitis. A summary of the notifications received is included in the statistical section. 10. MASS X-RAY The Mobile Unit of the North Western Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board visited various parts of the Borough during the year. Same 6,300 people attended and 31 cases were referred for further investigation. For the purposes of examination of staff and others whom it was necessary to refer, use was made of the permanent units situated at 32, Drayton Park, N.5 and Maida Vale (at junction with Carlton Vale, W.9.) Sessions for both men and women are held as follows:32. Drayton Park Monday 2.00 p.m. - 4.15 p.m. and 5.00 p.m. - 7.15 p.m. Tuesday 9.45 a.m. -12.30 p.m. and 2.00 p.m. - 5.30 p.m. Wednesday 9.45 a.m. -12.30 p.m. and 2.00 p.m. - 5.30 p.m. Thursday 2.00 p.m. - 4.15 p.m. and 5.00 p.m. - 7.15 p.m. Maida Vale Monday 2.00 p.m. - 4.30 p.m. and 5.00 p.m. - 7.30 p.m. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS Appointments to the Council's permanent staff are subject to passing a medical examination, which includes a chest X-ray usually carried out by the permanent mass radiography units at Drayton Park and Maida Vale. Examinations are normally carried out by the Medical Officer of Health or the Deputy Medical Officer of Health. Eighty-seven examinations were undertaken during the year. Fifty were in respect of new appointments; 29 were for transfer to the permanent staff; 2 were special reports required because of absence through sickness; 1 was for extension of service; 1 for inter-departmental transfer; 4 were on behalf of other authorities. 11. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT. 1948. SECTION 50. In ten instances the Public Health Department was called upon to arrange the burial of a person who was either without any known relative, or the relatives were unable to meet the cost of arranging a private funeral. The total cost of the burials was £110.14s.9d. and £86.17s.1d. has been recovered from the estates of the deceased, from relatives or from death grants. CARE OF THE AGED. Much publicity has been given in recent years to the problem of the aged and as the facilities provided by the Council and voluntary societies became more widely known, so more cases requiring assistance come to light. In 1964, 275 cases were reported to the department, an increase of over 80 per cent compared with the previous year. It is obvious more of the department's time is being occupied with problems of the aged and the continued expansion of such services as meals on wheels, home helps, flatlets for old people, holidays, etc. must be anticipated. In two cases it was necessary to obtain a magistrate's order for compulsory removal to hospital. One lady, aged 87 years, finally entered a home voluntarily and the magistrate's order was not enforced. The other case, a man aged 92 years, was senile and unable to look after himself. An order was obtained for his detention in hospital for three weeks, but as he subsequently agreed to remain in hospital it was not necessary to renew the order. PUBLIC HEALTH LAUNDRY. This service has now been in operation for eight years. The number of persons requiring assistance showed a very slight decrease during the year and varied between 24 and 30. At 31st December 1964 five of the patients had been having the laundry service for more than four years, two for more than two years and six for more than one year. The soiled articles are collected, laundered and delivered twice a week and the total number of articles dealt with during the year was 15,261. 12. DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION. During the year 47 rooms were disinfected after infectious disease in 39 premises and a total of 4,154 articles were passed through the steam chamber. This figure includes a regular weekly collection from one hospital of approximately 75 blankets, and weekly spraying of soiled linen is carried out at another hospital. A total of 355 rooms in 189 premises were treated for various types of infestation during 1964. In addition to the ordinary disinfection or disinfestation of premises, 10 filthy or verminous rooms were cleared after vacation by their occupants. In 3 instances the Department assisted in drying bedding, carpets, etc. after homes had suffered flooding from burst pipes, etc. 13. SANITART CIRCUMSTANCES. Water Supply. All the drinking water used in the Borough is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board. There are no private wells in use. All the dwelling houses in the Borough have a piped supply direct to the houses and none is supplied by standpipes. Regular and frequent sampling is carried out by the Metropolitan Water Board and samples are also taken by your inspectors and examined by the Borough Analyst on receipt of complaint or if there is any reason to suspect the purity of any particular supply. The following is an extract from the Annual Report of the Metropolitan Water Board for 1964: All Thames-Derived Water Natural Fluoride grammes per litre) 0.25 No. of samples taken 371 Coliform count. Per Cent samples negative in 100 ml. 99.95 No. of samples taken 3,811 Sewerage All the houses in Hampstead are connected to the main drainage system, the sewerage passing eventually to the London County Council's main sewers and to the sewage disposal works outside the Borough. The Finchley Road widening scheme has involved modifications of many drainage systems and alterations and renewals of sewer connections. This has been under the constant supervision of your inspectors. Barbers and Hairdressers. Eighteen inspections were made of barbers' premises. Minor defects and infringements only were discovered and were readily dealt with by the proprietors concerned. Ninety premises are registered under Section 18 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954. 14. Shopa Act 1950. Your inspectors have continued to exercise their duties under this act. No contraventions were reported. The Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act. 1951. There are now no firms in the Borough registered for the use of filling materials used in manufacturing bedding and other articles of upholstery. Common Lodging Houses. There are no common lodging houses in the Borough. General Public Health Inspection. A summary of the work of the Public Health Inspectors in connection with complaints and nuisances, inspections of schools, public buildings, bombed sites, private roads and passageways, drainage work, factories, etc. will be found in the Statistical Section. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT. 1949. Destruction of Rats and Mice. Surface Treatment. The Council continues to employ the services of two rodent operators under the general supervision of the Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector. There has been little change in the tempo of this work over that performed during past years and treatment has conformed with Ministry recommendations. A Table showing the summary of surface treatments appears in the Statistical Section. Control of Rats in Sewers. Sewer baiting has continued under the purview of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, who has discontinued prebaiting and poisoning with the usual poisons and anti-coagulants in favour of fluoracetamide, with generally advantageous results. 15. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. Clean Air Act. 1956 The year' s progress in this sphere took place against the background, mentioned in last year's report, of a changing position in solid smokeless fuel supplies. The attention of the staff concerned was chiefly directed toward the work of fireplace conversion in Area No.6 in which there was a particularly heavy response from householders in applying for assistance in the form of grants. The Smoke Control Order affecting Area No.7 was made by the Council in December and confirmation is still awaited from the Minister of Housing and Local Government. The survey of Area No.8 wascompleted. The trend towards gas heating was continued, bearing out the optimum of the Ministry of Fuel and Power in the face of decreasing coke supplies, but the efforts of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government to popularise the solid fuel stove or room heater as it is now called, do not seem to have yet borne fruit. In December Circular 60/64 issued by the Minister of Housing and Local Government excluded the direct electric fire from the category of appliances ranking for grant, leaving householders with a preference for electric heating no other choice than the off-peak storage heater. The motive for this is clearly to relieve the peak hour load for electric power, an indication of the battle to cope with the ever increasing demand for electricity for both power and heating. Area No.7 when confirmed will produce interesting information as the first area to be fully affected by the suggestions contained in the controversial Circular No.69/63. This publication advocated the payment of grants on an increased scale to encourage the adoption of appliances other than open coke-burning grates. Portents were of course observed in Area No.6 but its recommendation could not be fully applied in that area since the Order was already made before the issue of the Circular. Mr.E.Ulrich, who has been responsible for the whole inception of Smoke Control work in Hampstead was in September transferred to other work for which he is particularly qualified and the duties ofSmoke Control Officer are now carried out by Mr. J. A .Woodman. A tribute might here be paid to Mr. Ulrich,s painstaking work in this field and to his initiative in the early days when there was little precedent to be followed. Through his efforts Hampstead has been able to play a full part in smoke control in London. 16. HEALTH EDUCATION The programme of health education in Hampstead was continued and enlarged during 1964. In the previous year a considerable effort was made to interest the public in the dangers of smoking cigarettes and although it is difficult to estimate the effects of this campaign, there is still a sustained interest in the subject shown by a number of groups of people. It was possible to improve the methods of health education in 1964, whereas in former years special programmes of health education consisted largely of lectures, it is now possible on most subjects to improve the lectures with slides, film strips, films and in other visual aids, and a tape-recorder has proved most useful in stimulating discussion. By these means, the audience is encouraged to take an active part rather than to remain as passive listeners. A special effort was made during the year to persuade householders who were disposing of old oil heaters to have them collected by the dustman and destroyed rather than to allow old heaters which did not conform to the present safety standards to be resold or re-used. The Department has continued to provide for and arrange lectures or discussion meetings with groups of all types and all ages in the Borough, and has provided publicity by way of posters and articles in newspapers and magazines. In addition, support has been given locally to the health education programmes of the London County Council. During the year, the Health Education Officer, Mr.G.L. Nicklin, wa3 seconded for a period to the Central Council for Health Education in order to carry out a lecture tour throughout England and Wales on the subject of Smoking and Health. Mr. Nicklin also lectures to Student Public Health Inspectors at the South-East London Technical College. 17. HOUSING. Slum Clearance. There are no areas in the Borough which require to be dealt with under this section of the Housing Act and no proposals have been included in the Minister of Housing and Local Government's programme for the period ending in 1970. Individually unfit houses and bad basements are still being dealt with but progress on these is controlled by the rehousing problems involved. Redevelopment Areas. Further extensive redevelopment proposals are in various stages of progress, and there is little doubt that within a very few years the character of many areas of the Borough will have changed completely. Housing Surveys. Much of your Inspector's time has been taken up with surveys and reports on groups of properties or individual premises where there have been allegations of undue pressure on tenants, or,where leases having fallen in, cases of hardship among displaced tenants have been investigated. Improvement Grants. I commented quite fully on the disappointing results regarding applications for improvement grants in 1963, and there is very little I can add to this. There was, however, a slightly increased number of applications in regard to standard grants due mainly to the owners of certain houses in multiple occupation taking advantage of the scheme in order to provide controlled tenants with additional amenities. Repair of Houses. Section 9. Housing Act 1957. Statutory Notices have been served in respect of the follwing premises 32, Holmdale Road Work done by owner. 51, Sherriff Road Work in progress by owner. 23, Kemplay Road Sale of premises to Council being negotiated. 48, Gascony Avenue Work done by owner 8, Birchington Road Work in progress by owner 29, Kylemore Road Work done by owner 79, Iverson Road Work done by owner 5, Mackeson Road Work done by owner 86, Maygrove Road Work done by Council 18. Houses in Multiple Occupation. The team of three inspectors working under the leadership of the Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector, Mr.F.V.Outlaw, and augmented in June 1964 by two technical assistants has continued to concentrate on houses in multiple occupation. During the period under review a total of 758 properties constituting 2,618 dwellings were inspected and reported upon. They provided accomodation for 4,659 adults and 764 children under the age of 10 years, within 6,707 rooms. The Code of Practice formulated by the Metropolitan Boroughs has continued to be applied as has also informal action. Additional amenities required by this standard have been provided as set out in the following table: Hot water supplies 1,044 Baths 308 Sinks 449 W.C.s 49 Food storage accommodation 376 Space heating facilities 32 Cooking facilities 197 There has been rather less tenant resistance than in 1963, but nevertheless 40 cases have submitted certificates of refusal to accept one or more of the additional amenities. Seventy-eight cases of overcrowding have been reported. These were mainly the result of natural family increases and were dealt with informally. The usual caution was also sent to the landlords concerned. The period between the service of notice and the commencement of work continues to be several months and in fact the time lag increases with the greater number of notices served. This is due to such factors as shortage of builders, prolonged negotiations etc. and cannot at present be avoided. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD. Food and Drugs Act. 1955. Food Hygiene (General) Regulations 1960. The Food Inspector, Mr.W.F.Newport, continued regular supervision of the quality of food sold in the borough and 495 samples were submitted to the Public Analyst. Fourteen samples were reported upon adversely by the Analyst compared with 22 in the previous year. 19. There is very little deliberate contamination of food by shopkeepers nowadays and most of the unsatisfactory samples are the result of inadequate labelling - usually on imported products, faulty machines or mechanical processes in the preparation of the food, bad storage conditions, and lastly lapses by the human element concerned in the supervision or handling of foodstuffs. Complaints are occasionally received concerning coffee bars situated in residential districts but the nuisances involved are generally matters for the police. Until legislation is provided which controls the establishment of this type of restaurant little can be done. The number of inspections of foodshops was very high this year, mainly as the result of enquiries concerning canned meat which was the suspected cause of an outbreak of typhoid fever in Aberdeen. OFFICES SHOPS AND RAILWAY PREMISES ACT. 1963 This Act came into force on the 1st August and consequently there has not been sufficient time to judge the full impact which the Act will have.
