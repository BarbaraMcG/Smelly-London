To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Seventeenth Annual Report on the sanitary condition of the Borough of Bermondsey during the year 1917. The death-rate was 18.8, compared with 17.2 in 1916 and 21.4 in 1915. The death-rate is discussed in an early section. The sections of the report are, as usual, divided into:— I.—Vital Statistics. II.—Notification of Infectious Diseases. III.—Sanitary Administration. IV.—Factories and Workshops. In the Appendix will be found the Local Government Board Tables, including a special Table on Infantile Mortality. Partly owing to paper shortage and the difficulty of getting printing done, also much of the time of the clerical staff being taken up with the Food Control and the Defence of the Realm Acts, I have found it necessary to cut down my Annual Report considerably. If reports of this kind are too long delayed, all interest vanishes, and as it is I am afraid that the 6 happenings of 1917 will interest only it few. Still we hope to keep up the continuity of the statistical and other reports on our activities and rely on the leniency of our critics, should the reading and statistical matters owing to the difficulties abovementioned not come up to expectation. I wish once more to record that between the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee and myself, there has been the usual cordial co-operation during the year under report. The staff of the Department has also shown itself most willing to fall in with the various new and additional duties cast upon them, and have done their part loyally in the promotion of the Public Health of Bermondsey. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, R. KING BROWN. 1.—VITAL STATISTICS. Population. The populations of the Borough of Bermondsey and its registration sub-districts, as enumerated in the Census of 1001 and 1911, and the estimate of the year under report are as follows:— 1901. 1911. Estimated to June 30th, 1917. Civil Population. Total Population. Bermondsey 82,483 81,959 70,081 78,118 Rotherhithe 38,460 35,247 30,127 33,590 St. Olave 9,817 8,697 7,427 8,275 Borough 130.7G0 125,903 107,635 119,983 The total population of Bermondsey for 1017 has been estimated by the Registrar-General as 110,083. This is approximately the number I would have estimated on the basis of the 7 decrease shown by the census of 1901 and 1911 had there been no war, and this figure has been utilized in estimating the birthrate. The civil population has been estimated by the RegistrarGeneral as 107,635, based on the National Register in conjunction with the two last census enumerations. As stated above the total population has been used in calculating the births and marriage rates, since the men in the forces have participated in it, but the smaller figure of the civil population has been used for the death rates as no deaths in the forces have been included. Births. The total number of births registered in the Borough for the 52 weeks ended December 29th, 1917, was 2,613, consisting of 1,332 males and 1,281 females. This is 1,215 below the average for the last 10 years, and 748 below the figure for 1916. In Table II. of the Appendix will be seen the figures for the last 10 years in the three registration sub-districts, and in Table I. figures for the whole Borough. The birth-rate for 1917 calculated on the "total population was 21.7 per thousand persons living, which is 5.4 below that for 1916 and 8.8 below the average for the last 10 years. Marriages. The total number of marriages in the Borough in 1917 was 1,015, being 200 below the number for 1916, and 194 below the average for the last 10 years. In Table X. of Appendix will be found further particulars as to sub-districts. The figures have been supplied by the Superintendent Registrar. This makes a marriage rate of 8 per 1,000 of the total population, 119,983, compared with a marriage rate calculated on the total population of 18 of last year, 1916, viz.. 123,665. Deaths. In Table III. and IV. of Appendix will be found the Local Government Board tables dealing with deaths in the Borough. 8 The extended table of causes of death initiated in 1904 has been omitted this year from the Appendix. The total number of deaths registered in the Borough for the year ended December 29th, 1917. was 1,807,, which is 300 more than in 1916, and 23 above the average for the last 10 years. When this figure is corrected by exclusion of deaths of nonparishioners occurring in the district, and the inclusion of deaths of parishioners occurring outside the district, the number is raised to 2,032. This is 72 more than in 1910, and 248 more than the average for the last 10 years. The death-rate for the Borough in 1917 was 18.8 per thousand living inhabitants, being 1.6 above that recorded in 1916, and 0.5 above the average for the last 10 years. In column 1, foot of Table I. of the Appendix will be found a list of places where deaths of non-parishioners occurred in the districts. There were 186 such deaths in all, against 155 in 1916, and 38 in 1915. 151 such deaths occurred in the infirmary; 8 in the workhouse, and 27 in River Thames and the Surrey Commercial Docks. 411 persons belonging to this Borough died in outlying institutions, against 453 in 1916, and 542 in 1915. The names of the various places where the deaths occurred will be found in columns 2 and 3 at foot of Table I. of Appendix. Infantile Mortality. The figure for this is 125 deaths under onu year to every 1,000 births. 9 Table A.—Infantile Mortality. Year. Whole Borough. London. No. of Deaths. Rate per 1,000 Births. No. of Deaths.

There has been an increase in the deaths from these diseases, the figures being 218, against 155 in the previous year, and 201 the average for the last ten years. This gives a zymotic death-rate of 2.02. The total number of deaths from notifiable diseases, viz., measles, scar-let fever, diphtheria, typhus fever and enteric fever, was 07, compared with 78 in 1916, and for the non-notifiable, viz.. whooping cough and diarrhoea, 121 compared with 77 in the previous year. Measles. There were 72 deaths due to this disease, which is 25 below the average for the last ten years, and 30 above the, number for 1916. Whooping Cough. 32 deaths were due to this cause, against 10 in 1016, 10 Enteric Fever. 6 deaths were duo to this cause, 3 in Bermondsey, 2 in Rotherhithe, and 1 in St. Olave's. The corresponding figures for 1916 were 2 for the Borough, viz., 1 in Bermondsey and 1 in Rotherhithe. Tubercular Diseases. The number of deaths from all forms of tubercular disease in 1917 was 274, against 266 in 1916. This figure comprises 107 for Bermondsey, 85 for Rotherhithe, and 22 for St. Olave's. Of these, 198 were due to phthisis and 76 to the other tubercular diseases. Phthisis. In Table B will be found particulars of deaths from phthisis since the year 1907. There were 198 deaths due to this cause, which is 14 more than the number recorded in the previous year. Table B—Phthisis. Sub. District. Bermondsey. Botherhithe. St. Olave. Whole Borough. London.

There has been a marked increase in the deaths from Measles, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, and Scarlet Fever, and this shows that there must have been an increased prevalence, which is confirmed by the notifications of the diseases which are notifiable. Of course we know that all infectious diseases are liable to a rise and fall, but making due allowance for all these things I cannot help thinking that part of the rise is due to the herding together of men, women and children during and in anticipation of Air Raids. 1 know of two cases of diphtheria which were started in this way, and on one or two nights 1 was present in the Town Hall, and found several cases of whooping cough among those who took shelter. Special inquiries were made as to attacks of pneumonia and measles, etc., and in many cases their onset was attributed to infection got in the shelters or the taking of young children from their warm beds in the middle of the night to go away to a shelter. It is very difficult, however, to know what to recommend on these occasions, for although the chances of any particular house being hit are extremely small, still unfortunately a great part of the damage in London fell upon small property, and those who witnessed the destruction occasioned by enemy bombs were little disposed to be influenced by the ordinary laws of probability, and made up their minds to run the risks of bombing in a more substantial building than their small houses. II.—NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE. In Table V. of Appendix will be found particulars of infectious diseases notified during the year under report. The number of cases notified, exclusive of notifications of tuberculosis, which numbered 567 was 1,885, compared with 935 in 1916 and 030 in 1015. All the diseases show a decrease on the number for the previous year, with the exception of diphtheria, scarlet fever and puerperal fever, which show an increase of 159, 48, and 2 respectively. The attack per thousand inhabitants was 17.5, against 8.2 for 1016. 12 27 cases were returned from hospital as not suffering from the disease for which they were notified, but if allowance is made for mild unreported cases, the recorded notifications would, if anything, understate the actual number of eases. Diphtheria. There were 408 cases of diphtheria notified in 1917 as against 249 cases in 1916. There was therefore a slight recrudescence of the disease, the cause of which I was unable to discover. The attack-rate per thousand inhabitants was 3.78, against 2.19 in 1916. The case mortality was 4.4 per cent., against 11.6 per cent, in 1916 and 8.8 per cent, in 1915. 17 cases were returned as not suffering from this disease. Scarlet Fever. The notifications of scalet fever in 1917 were 300 against 252 in 1916. This is an increase of 48. The distribution of the disease in the various Wards, as shown in Table V. of Appendix was fairly uniform. 8 cases were returned from hospital as not suffering from scarlet fever. There was 1 death, which gives the very low case' mortality of 0.3 per cent., against 1.9 per cent. in 1916. The disease, as in recent years, was of a very mild type. The attack rate per thousand inhabitants was 2.7 against 2.2 in 1916. The sources of infection were mostly previous cases. There was no outbreak traceable to any common cause such as infected milk or school contagion. Measles. The number of deaths for 1917 was 72, against 42 in 1916, 110 in 1915 and 79 in 1914. There was a considerable prevalence of measles in the. Metropolis which was shared in by Bermondsey. The number of primary cases notified was 1,078. including 120 eases of German measles and 958 of measles. 13 Enteric fever. 7 cases of enteric fever were notified, being 3 for Bermondsey and 4 for Rotherhithe. 1 case was returned as not suffering, making an actual total of 0. The total number of cases notified in the previous year was 13. Puerperal Fever. 4 cases of puerperal fever were notified. There were 3 deaths from this disease during the year. Ophthalmia, Neonatorum. There were 9 cases of this disease notified during the year. Under this heading is included every kind of "sore eyes" occurring in the newly born. They were all visited by the Health Visitor, who instructed the mother to immediately seek medical advice. Cerebrospinal Meningitis. 6 cases were notified in 1917; 1 case was returned as not suffering. Most of them consisted of the sporadic form known as posterior-basic meningitis. Two of them occurred in children under one year of age. Polio-Myelitis. No cases were notified in 1017, against 12 in 1916. Bacteriological Laboratory. The total number of specimens examined in 1917 whs 1,212, as compared with 689 in 1916, and 919 in 1915. Table c . Nature of Specimen. Total Examinations. Results of Examination. Positive.
