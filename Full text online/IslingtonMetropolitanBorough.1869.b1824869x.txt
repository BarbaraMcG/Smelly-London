ISL 38 REPORT on THE SANITARY CONDITION of the Parish of St. Marg Islington, DURING THE YEAR 1869. by EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., (Lond.) member of the royal college of physicians; fellow of the royal medical and chirurgical society of london, etc. MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. J. & I. TIREBUCK, STEAM PRINTERS AND LITHOGRAPHERS, Monkwell Street, E.C., and Islington. 1870. TO THE VESTRY OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Fourteenth Annual Report. In doing so I have to remark, that although our population has suffered severely from two epidemic and contagious diseases, chiefly affecting infants and young persons, namely, hooping cough and scarlet fever, yet, on the whole, the mortality and sickness do not appear to have been so great as they were in 1868. Circumstances have been more favourable. Food has been cheaper, although work has been scarce for the labouring classes, and while the winter was mild the summer quarter was comparatively cool. I shall have occasion, however, to record the appearance, chiefly in one corner of the parish, of a form of fever which we have experienced in common with other parts of the metropolis. MORTALITY AND SICKNESS. Four thousand two hundred and sixty-five deaths of residents in Islington were registered during the 52 weeks ending January 1st, 1870. In order to correct this for deaths of some of our residents which may be supposed to have taken place in hospitals, prisons, &c., in other parts of London, we may add another 237 deaths, making a probable total of 4,502 on which to calculate our death-rate for the year. When the census is made next year, I shall be in a better position than now to calculate the death-rate. There is no reason, however, to believe that it was excessive. Of the deaths registered, 2,056 were males (an actually smaller number than last year) and 2,209 females. About half were children under five years of age. The births registered during the year are represented in the following table:— West Sub-District. East Sub-District. Whole Parish. Males Females. Total. Males. Females. Total. Males. Females. Total. 1st Quarter 482 493 975 527 483 1,010 1,009 976 1,985 2nd ,, 483 440 923 467 439 906 950 879 1,829 3rd ,, 417 417 834 481 480 961 898 897 1,795 4th „ 489 431 920 474 480 954 963 911 1,874 1,871 1,781 3,652 1,949 1,882 3,831 3,820 3,663 7,483 There are some things worth noticing in this table. 4 1. The births that have occurred are 235 fewer than they were in 18G8. 2. The diminution of the births is more marked in the west than in the east sub-district. There were fewer births registered in the west sub-district by 153, and in the east sub-district by 82. 3. That the excess of births over deaths was 2,985, while in 1868 it was 3,261, itself a diminution upon the previous year. Now something of the same kind has been observed in London at large, since 3,814 fewer births were registered in 1869 than in 1868. The birth-rate of London was 353 per 10,000 of population in 1869 and 370 per 10,000 in 1868. The number of new cases of sickness of all kinds recorded in the books of the Poor Law surgeons, in those of the two dispensaries and of the Pentonville convict prison, amount together to 36,715. This number is nearly 4,000 less than was recorded in 1868 (allowing for the difference in the number of weeks included). The number of cases of disease of the "miasmatic" order, treated by the public surgeons in 1869, was 5,884; in 1868 it was 6,513. Hence, as the mortality from these diseases was, on the whole, greater than in 1868, we must infer that the predominant maladies of this class were of a character to cause naturally a higher mortality—that is to say, that the maladies were of a more fatal sort. We shall sea that this was so, for whereas in 1868 the less fatal diseases, diarrhoea and measles, prevailed excessively, so in 1869 the diarrhoea and measles produced much less sickness, while scarlet fever and hooping cough, both much more fatal, prevailed very greatly. They were the epidemic maladies of the year. CAUSES OF SICKNESS AND DEATH. Table I. exhibits the several causes of the deaths registered in the parish during the year, and Table II. the nature of the more important cases of public sickness recorded in the books to which I have access. Diseases of the Organs of Respiration occasioned 796 deaths, nearly equally distributed between the two sub-districts of the parish. Of these nearly one-half, namely 393, were of children under five years of age, and while the majority of the remainder, namely 355, were aged 40 years and upwards. The number of cases in the public practice was 7,290. Diarrhœal Affections, including dysentery and cholera, occasioned 233 deaths, a number less by 60 than in 1868. The number of cases recorded in the public practice was 1,900, or 614 less than in 1868. The summer diarrhœal outburst was coincident with the sudden rise of temperature above 60° together with absence of rain in the first weeks of July. The largest number of cases recorded in any week was 146 in the second week after the highest weekly mean temperature of the year had been attained, viz., 66.9°. 5 Scarlet Fever occasioned 313 deaths, no such mortality haying resulted from it in any year since 1863, when 392 deaths occurred. The fatality of scarlet fever, however, varies so much at different times, from season, weather, and epidemic constitution, that the mortality affords no certain indication of the prevalence of the disease. The number of cases in the public practice of the parish was 714; in 1863 it was 672. Hence we infer that while it was as prevalent, and perhaps more prevalent than in the latter year, the fatality of the disease was not so great. The period of greatest epidemic extension commenced in the third week in August. An outbreak in which 54 cases were recorded happened indeed in the 2nd and 3rd weeks of July, but it abated during the next three weeks. Between the third week in August and the fourth week in November, 412 of all the cases occurred, that is to say, in the course of 15 weeks. Scarlet fever approached us from the parishes on our eastern border, and throughout the epidemic prevailed more in the eastern than in the western half of the parish. Of the 313 deaths 180 occurred in the eastern and 133 in the western sub-district. Hooping Cough became prevalent as the year 1868 closed, and has continued to be epidemic during the whole of 1869. Its greatest prevalence was between the first week in April and the end of August. Altogether, we recorded 1,014 cases in the public practice ; the largest number recorded in any previous year was 709, in 1866. The deaths (all but 10 of children under five years of age,) numbered 324. The largest number in any previous year was 220 in 1866. Small Pox produced only 14 deaths in the entire year, the number of cases in public practice being 49. Relapsing Fever.—It appears from the report of the London Fever Hospital that during 1869 forty-eight cases of "relapsing fever" were admitted into that institution from Islington. Some of these were tramps sent from the workhouse. The greater part were sent in from the out-door parochial practice. I have a record of the names, addresses, and ages of thirty-five of those cases included among the 102 cases of fever among the out-door poor in Table II. The first of these cases was that of a boy aged 18, residing at No. 10, Rose and Crown Court, and from him the disease spread first of all to the four remaining members of his family, all of whom dwelt together in a very small, damp, and miserable room on the ground floor of this house. From this family it spread to No. 14, where the four members of one family and a boy were attacked in succession. At No. 8, first of all the five persons living together in the ground floor room were attacked, and at a later period five members in succession of a family living in a room on the next floor, making altogether ten persons in the house. At No. 11, four members of a family living in the ground floor room and a person who came to lodge with them from another part of the parish, were seized with the disease, and one died. At No. 12, three members of one family were attacked, and at No. 5, the woman who is engaged by the owner 6 of the court to attend to the court and take the rents had the fever. In addition, a girl who made herself useful in attending to the sick and assisting different people in the court, and who, though living there, had no settled residence in any particular house, suffered from it. Thus there were 25 cases in the court out of a population of 115 persons, of both sexes and all ages. It is noticeable, as connected with the degree of infectiousness of the disease, that while it spread with certainty to all the persons living together in one small room whenever one of them suffered, in only one instance did it spread to another family in the same house. These are all houses having but one room on a floor. And it is further noticeable, that out of seven families attacked with the fever, five dwelt in rooms upon the ground floor. These houses, which I shall mention presently, I have reported under the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings' Act, are the most wretched and ill-constructed houses for the poor in the parish, dark, very imperfectly ventilated, with no opening in the rear (except in one or two of the upper rooms), and with walls reeking with damp from the foundation. The ground floor rooms are especially damp and unwholesome. The extreme unwholesomeness of this court was dwelt upon in my annual report for 1863, when I pointed out the high mortality which prevailed there. In addition to these cases a family of four persons residing in a small back room at No. 6, Halton Place, had the fever; and also three members of a family which I found in a lodging-house in Gordon Court. The remaining cages were scattered about the parish. SANITARY WORK OF THE YEAR. Table III. exhibits the ordinary work performed by and under the superintendence of the Inspectors, during the past year. In consequence of the great prevalence of scarlet fever, a good deal of time was occupied in the superintendence of disinfections of premises, and the contents of rooms, bedding, &c., where the disease occurred. I canuot say I have always been satisfied with the manner in which these disinfections have been performed, since very much has necessarily depended upon the voluntary aid of the poor people most immediately concerned, and whom it is difficult to impress with the importance of the measures directed to be taken. Still we have done our best with the means at our disposal, and I have found my hands strengthened by the admirable provisions of the Sanitary Act in this respect. I have often wished that better means were at my disposal for the disinfection of bedding and clothing, and I hope that before long, the Vestry will see themselves in a position to supply a Disinfecting Chamber, to which such articles may be brought from poor houses. Mr. Fraser, of Bromley-by-Bow, has recently patented an apparatus which promises to furnish all that is requisite for this purpose, at a moderate cost, and it has been reported upon favourably by a Committee of the Metropolitan Association of Medical Officers of Health, who experimented with it upon bedding and woollen articles. It consists of a brick oven or chamber, occupying a space of eight 7 feet square, the heat of which can be regulated, and into which sulphurous acid vapour can be introduced; and of a closed iron truck or carriage, provided with shelves, racks, and doors. Into the latter are collected the articles to be disinfected, and in it they are conveyed to the chamber. The truck is run in and opened, the door of the Chamber closed, and when the disinfection is completed, is with its disinfected contents taken back to the place from whence the articles were brought, the clothing, &c., not being removed until returned to the owner. The total cost of the apparatus and its erection is about £65. During the hottest weeks of the year, I obtained the sanction of the Sanitary Committee to the watering of some of the lowest streets and courts of the parish with a weak solution of Carbolic Acid. The power possessed by this cheap disinfectant to arrest putrefaction was evidenced by the sweetening of the atmosphere, which was remarkable wherever it was used. For the streets, the acid was put into the watering carts, and the courts were watered by hand. Rose and Crown Court was thus treated during the period of prevalence there of relapsing fever, while Macdougal's Powder was used in the privies, and the court kept cleansed by one of our own men. The use of Carbolic Acid in watering is highly spoken of in the third report of the New York Board of Health; but there the yards and heaps of refuse on poor premises were also regularly disinfected in a similar manner. At a time when the mortality from diarrhœal affection was steadily rising, an immediate check was thus placed upon it in the worst wards where this plan was adopted, while it continued to rise in those where it was not adopted, or adopted inefficiently. It is a preventive measure which there is every encouragement to extend in future seasons. During the hot weeks of the summer, complaints arose of the offensive smell on Sundays, proceeding from the roadside and the gutter in the Essex Road, in consequence of the refuse and foul matters left by the costermongers who occupied stalls there up to late on Saturday night. On two occasions a man was hired to sweep up the refuse and cart it away early on the Sunday morning, after which, some of Macdougal's Powder was sprinkled along the gutter. There would be an advantage, and it would conduce to public convenience if some arrangement could be made for a similar proceeding being habitually carried out in the summer months, not in the Essex Road only, but in other parts of the parish where costermongers' stalls are permitted to stand on Saturday night. The duty might probably be included in one or other of the cleansing contracts. On making a personal visit to all the families in Rose and Crown Court, when relapsing fever broke out there, I found so much real destitution, that I communicated with the Board of Guardians. They showed every anxiety to assist in arresting its spread by giving relief, and directed the district Surgeon, Mr, Turner, to order such food as he thought necessary to endangered families. 8 Every house in which scarlet fever has been known by me to have broken out, has been visited by our inspectors, who have been directed to leave with each family a copy of an instructional paper which I drew up for the purpose of spreading information as to the best domestic means of arresting its progress, and as to the provision of the Sanitary Act in this respect. Copies of the same paper were forwarded to all the ministers of religion, masters of public schools, dispensaries, and parochial medical officers, as well as to all the private medical men practising in the parish, for distribution among their patients. Visits of a similar character were made where sickness or death was reported from other infectious or spreading fevers. Of the premises reported by me under the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings' Act up to the time of my last annual report, Parsells Court has undergone various amendments, by which the ventilation has been improved, and the nuisance of the common privy at the end of the court has been lessened. The houses reported in Brand Street, with the huts in the rear, have been closed by an order of the Vestry, the owner having made default in respect of the improvements ordered to be carried out. With respect to Albert Square and the adjoining houses in Albert Street, some have been demolished to make room for the extension of the Highbury Station of the North London Railway: as regards the other houses, although some work appears to have been done, the requirements of the act have not yet been fully complied with. The premises reported since that time with the present stage of the proceedings, are as follow:- Houses and premises in Broad Yard. Reported on by Surveyor. Owner heard in opposition. Both reports referred to a Special Committee of the Vestry, and orders for improvement issued in accordance with their recommendations. Houses and premises in Swan Yard. Reported on by Surveyor. Owner heard in opposition. Both reports referred to a Special Committee of the Vestry. Orders deferred to see effect of improvements voluntarily undertaken by the owner. 21, Rufford's Buildings. Reported on by Surveyor. Owner heard by his Counsel in opposition. Both reports referred to a Special Committee of the Vestry. Premises in Clarence Lane. Reported on by Surveyor. Both reports referred to a Special Committee of the Vestry, and orders for improvements issued in accordance with their recommendations. 9 Two Stable residences in Edward's Mews. Reported on by Surveyor. Orders issued, with consent of owner, for closure of premises, which are now no longer occupied as dwellings. Sixteen Houses in Rose and Crown Court. Reported on by Surveyor. Owner heard by his Counsel in opposition to the reports. Both reports referred to a Special Committee of the Vestry for their opinion. In carrying out the Workshops Act no cases have been taken up except on complaint. In most instances these complaints have been anonymous; sometimes when a visit has been paid it has been found that the complaint was based upon a misconception of facts, and where it has been well founded we have obtained all we desired by verbal communication with the master and supplying him with a copy of the regulations. It appears to me that with the present statute, which, while making the Vestry the local authority for its execution, limits its powers below those of a factory inspector it is vain to attempt anything more. It is to be hoped, when next the question comes before Parliament, that the Workshop and Factory Acts will be consolidated, so that all may be placed under the same authority. In one factory, namely, the emery works of Messrs. Acton and Borman, where the workmen were dangerously exposed to the inhalation of the fine dust produced by crushing and sifting glass and emery stone, I have required two blowers, or fans, to be put up for the purpose of removing the dust. This has been done and they work very effectually. With respect to trade nuisances, the Vestry has dealt with two of the varnish factories at Belle Isle under the 54th section of the Buildings Act of 1844, namely, those of Messrs. Turner and Messrs. Jensen and Nicholson. The latter have discontinued their works; the former have agreed to do so as soon as they can remove their works from the neighbourhood. A nuisance having arisen from the printing ink works of Messrs. Shackell and Edwards, in the Hornsey Road, due to the irritating vapours escaping from their calcining house, I have directed some amendments by which the escape shall be prevented, and the vapours be drawn off by means of a fan. 10 In my last report I had occasion to mention the frequency with which unsound fish wa3 supplied to costermongers, and that a communication, by way of remonstrance, was made to the City authorities having the control of Billingsgate market. This has been so far effectual, that we have only once had occasion to interfere by condemning fish on this account. I am, Gentlemen, Your very obedient Servant, EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., M.R.C.P, Medical Officer of Health. March 30th, 1870. TABLE I. DEATHS REGISTERED IN ISLINGTON DURING (Deaths of Non-Residents West.

The weather at the opening of the year was so mild, that in the first week in February the gooseberry was in leaf; the young shoots of elder were three inches long ; the buds were bursting on the lilac, rose, and pear; and the hazel was in bloom. The almond was in bloom in the second week in February. The pear was in full bloom in the first week in April, and the elm bursting into leaf. There were only two slight thunder storms on May 19th and September 10th. Thunder was heard on August 1st and October 1st, and lightning was seen on September 29th. •Instead of stating the Means of Observations for each Calendar Month, I have stated them in periods corresponding with those used in my Monthly Tables, which alone can serve any useful purpose for comparison with the accompanying Sicknes3 and Mortality. REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON, > FOR JANUARY, 1869. No. CXLI. The unusually high atmospheric temperature which characterised nearly the whole of last year has been prolonged into the month of January. One result of it has been that the mortality has been much less than is customary in this month. The deaths registered amount to 350. Had the death-rate of January for the last ten years prevailed, the registered deaths would have amounted to 417. I have frequently notified the fact that the number of deaths cannot be taken as the index of general sickness or healthiness: so in this month the sickness recorded in the public practice of the Parish has been excessive. The cases on the books amount to 3201, about 400 more than in January last year. Not a single death from small-pox has been registered, and only five cases appear upon the sickness table. The epidemic diseases of children, which have been unusually prevalent, are measles and hooping cough, but both are in progress of declining. I have already, in my last Annual Report, pointed out that, with us, measles becomes epidemic every second year, having a period of cyclical recurrence. This fact will lead us to anticipate no severe outbreak this year after the present epidemic period has come to an end. The epidemic of scarlet fever is steadily dying out, and the cases of sorethroat, so commonly met with for some months past, though still very numerous, are also reduced in number. Both the number of cases of respiratory diseases and the deaths from this cause have been very great. Many cases have been observed presenting some of the characteristic features of "influenza," and it is to be noted that three of the deaths in the mortuary table are thus designated. 2 For more than a year and a half I have regularly suspended at the entrance of the Vestry Hall a daily record of meteorological observations of the temperature, atmospheric humidity, and rain-fall. I append to this Report, and shall append to future Monthly Reports, the adopted means for each week, as calculated from these observations. The observations are made in my garden at Compton Terrace with instruments certified at Greenwich. METEOROLOGY OF JANUARY. Thermometers 4 feet from ground.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR FEBRUARY, 1869. No. CLXII. Three hundred and forty-eight deaths of residents in Islington were registered in the four weeks ending February 27th. The average mortality of the corresponding period for ten years past was 365, when corrected for increase of population. The mortality then has been about the same as that observed in the month of January. The general amount of public sickness has, however, been much less. The new cases of sickness recorded amount to 2924 cases against 3201 in January. Not only has the general sickness been reduced, but the amount of respiratory disease, with its depressing accompaniment, has been greatly lowered; since, whereas 1029 cases of such disease and 103 deaths were recorded in January, only 731 cases and 69 deaths have been recorded in the Tables appended to this Report. The epidemic of measles is extinguished, only 16 cases having been noted during the month; and scarlatina has been stationary at about 20 cases per month. For several weeks past there has been a good deal of typhoid fever in the Northern part of the parish; and wherever it has appeared I have taken measures to obtain a dis-infection of the house drains, and in addition, carbolic acid dis-infections have been used in the neighbouring sewers. The unusually high temperature which has prevailed during December and January has probably favoured the operation of the specific cause of this disease. Sore throats, or affections so designated, are still too prevalent. 2 METEOROLOGY OF FEBRUARY. Thermometers 4 feet from ground. Degree of Atmospheric Humidity, Saturation being represented by 100.

The three hundred and ninety.nine deaths registered in the five weeks ending April 3rd, represent a mortality less, by sixty.two deaths, than would have happened had the death.rate for this month been equal to the average of the ten previous years. The total new cases ot' sickness recorded upon our Sickness Table are less numerous than they were in March last year. Both measles and scarlet fever have continued to lessen in prevalence since February, and may be regarded as quiescent, even for this season of the year. The only diseases which have been unusually prevalent are hooping cough, among the members of the zymotic class, and acute diseases of the chest: among the latter, cases of pleurisy seem to have been more common than usual. The mean temperature of the month has been eight degrees lower than that of February. METEOROLOGY OF MARCH. Thermometers 4 feet from ground.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR APRIL, 1869. No. CLXIV. The mortality table for the month of April corresponds in the number of deaths registered (310) very closely with that of the same month last year, and represents a loss by death of 41 persons less than that which would have been experienced had the average death rate of the previous ten years prevailed. The new cases of sickness, also, have been less numerous than in April last year. The month may be regarded, therefore, as having been tolerably healthy. Of the epidemic and contagious maladies, hooping cough alone has been more prevalent than usual; 83 new cases were recorded, and 33 deaths from this disease registered. April is, however, the month in which this disease usually begins to spread, but the extension began earlier than is customary this year. My experience here has demonstrated that the spread of hooping cough is promoted by a mean temperature above 46°, and especially by one between 57° and 60°, and that at this season of the year the cases are more numerous than they otherwise would be, when the atmosphere is (as has been the case this year) warmer and drier than usual. As the temperature continues to rise therefore towards 60°, we may expect a yet further spread of the disease, unless the effect of the rise of temperature is counteracted by an accompaniment of wet weather. Diarrhoea has prevailed more extensively than usual, apparently as a result of the unusual warmth of the weather and comparatively small rainfall. Rain only fell on 7 days out of the 28. There is only further to note the large number of deaths, amounting to 26, from apoplexy and paralysis, and 19 from the convulsions of children. 2 METEOROLOGY OF APRIL.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR MAY, 1869. No. CLXV. The mortality of the parish, during the four weeks ending May 29th, has been below the average. Three hundred and one deaths, which were registered, represent a mortality less, by about 30, than the mean corrected mortality of the ten previous years. The epidemic of the season is whooping cough, of which 99 cases have been recorded in the public practice, while 26 deaths are found recorded upon the mortuary table. The only other disease which has given me much anxiety is scarlet fever, which, spreading to us from the eastern districts, has proved fatal to ten persons, chiefly residing in the eastern half of the parish. It has prevailed principally in that part of the parish which lies nearest to Hoxton. An outbreak in Lindsay Cottages has specially attracted my attention, in consequence of the bad sanitary condition of the dwellings, which we have much difficulty, and have met with many delays in getting remedied. Speaking generally, there has been less public sickness, by about 430, cases than was recorded in April. The weather has been such as is calculated to promote a good general condition of the public health at this season of the year. 2 METEOROLOGY OF MAY. Thermometers 4 feet from ground.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR JUNE, 1869. No. CLXVI. When the rapid extension of our Parish is taken into account, the amount of sickness and mortality prevalent amongst us during the five weeks, which I count into the month of June, contrasts favourably with that observed last year. And this is in accord with the fact of the more favourable atmospheric conditions, and especially with the comparative coolness of the season. Three hundred and seventy deaths were registered, against 382, the mean mortality of the previous ten years, supposing that the population had been as large as it is at present. The number of cases of sickness which I have recorded is 334.5, against 3906 cases occurring in the same institutions during the corresponding period of last year. Up to the close of the month there had been comparatively very little summer diarrhœa. The contagious diseases which have prevailed most have been chicken.pox, hooping cough, and scarlet fever. Of chicken.pox there have been 45 cases in the public practice of the Parish—it has never prevailed so extensively since I have held my present office. Hooping cough, as was anticipated, has increased, with the lise of mean temperature and dry weather, from 99 cases in four weeks to 161 cases in five weeks—the registered deaths rising from 26 in May to 58 in June Scarlet fever has risen from 35 cases and.10 registered deaths in the four weeks of May, to 47 cases and 18 registered deaths in the five weeks of June. It is still mostly prevalent in the South.Eastern part of the Parish, but 15 cases out of the 47 were observed in Lower Holloway. 2 METEOROLOGY OF JUNE. Thermometers 4 feet from ground.

The 316 deaths which took place in the Parish during July are fewer by 38 than the mean deaths occurring in July during the last ten years, when corrected for increase of population. Still there has been a good deal of sickness. Diarrhoea—some of it of a choleraic type—has been very prevalent, and has carried off 67 children. Scarlet.fever has been spreading more than it did in June, but it has been less fatal—indeed, there has been more of it in the Parish this month than in any July since 1863. Chicken.pox has continued to prevail among children. There has still been a good deal of hooping.cough, but it has been less prevalent, and also less fatal, than it was in June. METEOROLOGY OF JULY.

The public health of the Parish, if we could put aside two kinds of epidemic sickness, would have been during the month of August tolerably satisfactory. The deaths (317) did not reach the average number (338), and the public sickness generally was not only less than in July, but less also than in the corresponding weeks of the three previous years. The two epidemic diseases which have prevailed so much as to qualify the inference that might be drawn from the total number of deaths and cases of sickness are scarlet fever and hooping cough. The former has prevailed more than in any August since the unhealthy year 1863, and the latter more than in any August since I have held office. Of scarlatina I have recorded 64 cases in the public practice of the parish, and 16 deaths in the parish at large; and of hooping cough no less than 101 cases and as many as 30 deaths throughout the parish. It is to be observed, however, that both of these diseases have been spreading more on the eastern than on the western side of the district. I have already pointed out that scarlet fever approached us this year from the east of London, a part of the metropolis which during the past month has, judging from the Registrar.General's return, been the principal seat of the mortality from this malady.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR, SEPTEMBER, 1869. No. CLXIX. The death rate of the parish, during the five weeks ending October 2nd, has been as nearly as possible the average death rate of September during the ten years last past. The number of deaths registered was 393. With respect to the total amount of public sickness, that is to say, the cases which come under the care of the Medical Officers of the parish and the public institutions, it has been decidedly less than in the corresponding period of the previous three years. Only two diseases have been any source of anxiety, but of these, one namely, Scarlet Fever has been prevailing to an extent, only equal to that observed in 1863, when 90 cases were recorded in the five weeks. During the five weeks to which this report relates, no less than 123 cases have been recorded, and probably this is not half the number that has happened in the parish. The number of deaths registered in the month has been 44; in 1863 the number of deaths was 36. This disease still shows a preference for the eastern side of the parish, but has been latterly extending to the western. With the hope of possibly doing some good by the diffusion of warning as to the contagiousness of the disease, and of giving information as to the mode of arresting its spread in a house, I have circulated, wherever it seemed desirable, copies of Dr. Budd's "directions," and have also endeavoured to induce the poor to make use of appropriate disinfectants. I have also issued a letter to the masters and managers of all the public day schools, requesting that great care should be exercised in admitting children from infected houses to mix with others. With the imperfect means at my disposal, however, it is quite impossible to cope with the ignorance and recklessness which, especially among the poor, favour and almost compel the extension of the disease by contagion. In one case which came under my notice, a family with scarlet fever left a room in the basement of a house in Upper Bemerton street, and it was immediately 2 let to another family which at once entered into occupation. The Sanitary Committee will doubtless deal with this case under a penal section (39th) of the Sanitary Act. In another case a clergyman and his family were permitted by a lodging house keeper to remain without warning in a house where one of the inmates was ill, and subsequently died of scarlet fever. Two of this gentleman's children took the disease and died. The Sanitary Act will not touch this case. METEOROLOGY OF SEPTEMBER. Thermometers 4 feet from ground.

The death-rate during the month of October has been as nearly as possible the average as corrected of the ten previous Octobers. Three hundred and twenty-eight deaths were registered. Of the two prevalent epidemic diseases, hooping cough has been declining, as testified both by our mortality and sickness table; scarlet fever, on the contrary, has been prevailing more seriously than ever, for whereas 123 cases were reported in the public practice during the five weeks of September, and 44 deaths registered as having occurred throughout the parish, I record during the four weeks of October 137 cases and 53 deaths. The disease which hitherto has been mostly met with on the eastern side of the parish has now travelled to the western, nearly an equal number of deaths having been registered in each sub-district. As matters stand at present, your Sanitary Officers have been able to do very little in the way of checking its progress, one of the most important preventive measures of all, namely, the immediate removal of the sick to a hospital, or the removal of the healthy from an infected house or room to a place of safety, being impossible. The fever hospital is full, and has long been so, and no other place for the sick has yet been provided. Our proceedings have consequently been confined to the carrying out of such imperfect disinfections as are practicable in a house where the inmates still remain. Two important memoranda have been issued upon this subject, one by the Medical Officer of the Privy Council, and the other by the Metropolitan Association of Medical Officers of Health, in reply to a challenge made to them by the Registrar-General. To both these documents I beg your earnest attention. During the course of the month I received from the Medical Department of the Privy Council a memorandum touching the reappearance in London, after a long interval, of a form of continued fever, which to us is almost a new disease. It is now commonly known under the name of relapsing fever. It is the same disease which was known in Ireland as the "famine fever." It is highly infectious, its spread being promoted by the low condition of the system, induced by deficiency of nutritious food, misery, and crowding. Although of little fatality, it 2 leaves behind it an extreme debility of long continuance. Being liable to spread through the entire of a poor family lodged together in a single room, it will have thus, if not checked, the effect of throwing additional burdens upon the poor rates. The most important measure of prevention would be the removal of the first case occurring in any house to a hospital. The disease which commenced among the Polish Jews in Whitechapel has now spread throughout the Metropolis, and is spreading and increasing now. Even should it shortly abate, which is scarcely likely, it is said, we may look for its replacement by a worse disease, namely, Typhus. Up to October, the only known cases in this parish were in tramps, but recently a case was sent to the hospital from Andover Gardens, and it has appeared since October in Rose and Crown Court. In one room five cases have occurred, four of which are in hospital now; and in another room of another house, I saw to-day three cases, which I requested Mr. Turner to send away at once. I must, in the existing state of things at the London Fever Hospital, suggest your adoption of one of two courses, either that you should make such arrangements with the managers of that hospital as will ensure the reception there of all the cases we may think it necessary to send, advising the guardians to direct their Medical Officers to forward there every case of fever that comes under their notice; or that under the powers given you by the 37th section of the Sanitary Act, you should provide a temporary place for the reception of the sick. I may remind you that whatever steps you may adopt, it should be adopted at once, before the disease has made headway among our poor population, otherwise it will be futile for any preventive purpose.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR NOVEMBER, 1869. No. CLXXI. Both the public sickness prevalent during the four weeks ending November 27th, and the mortality in the parish have been unusually great. Three hundred and ninety-six deaths were registered, or 31 above the corrected average for November during the previous ten years. The excess of mortality is noticeable chiefly in the class of “zymotic” diseases, which occasioned 112 deaths, and in the class of "local'' diseases, which occasioned 184 deaths. The cases of sickness attended at the public expense were 3206, that is nearly equal to the number recorded in November last year. Probably the distress prevailing from deficiency of work in the lower strata of society will partly account for the swelling of this total. Living, as these people commonly do, from hand to mouth, and making no provision in times of prosperity for those depressions of trade which recur from time to time, the misfortune of sickness in the family drives them to seek medical aid from charitable sources. Unhappily, having once learnt the lesson of dependence, a return to self-reliance is a slow and laborious proceeding. The totals of both sickness and death are chiefly swollen by the continued prevalence of scarlet fever and of pulmonary diseases. With respect to the former, it will be noticed that our monthly cases have fallen slightly from 137 in October to 104 in November, and the deaths have been 56 against 53 in October. Cold or damp weather is unfavourable to recovery from this disease. We have had no such mortality as this from scarlet fever in November since 1859, when, with a much smaller population, we registered 38 deaths. It has occasioned untold domestic sorrow, in some instances sweeping away all the children in a family, and in one instance both the mother and children. Happily, the prevalence of the disease is now beginning to abate, as it invariably does on the setting in of cold weather. The cold damp weather has also proved fatal to children suffering from hooping cough. Pulmonary diseases taken together (bronchitis, pneumonia, and pleurisy), have furnished us with 852 cases; last year the total was precisely the same. The mortality from these diseases throughout the parish, however, has been much heavier: 112 deaths having been registered against 85 in November last year. 2 I mentioned in my last Report the outbreak of “Relapsing” fever among the people occupying Rose and Crown Court. From the beginning of November to the date of this Report, 17 cases have occurred there in persons belonging to six families. Three cases have occurred since. The present experience is that when it has entered a room, every person occupying that room has sooner or later been seized by it. On becoming aware of the presence of the fever, I visited personally every family in the court, and found nearly all in a state of distress from want of work and food. On representing the facts to the Board of Guardians, Mr. Turner, the District Medical Officer, was empowered to order relief in food to any that he thought required it, independently of their being absolutely sick. It has been, hitherto, the practice of the owner of the court to see to the periodical cleansing of the privies, which have always given us much trouble from the dirty habits of the people; but since the outbreak of the fever, the Sanitary Committee has undertaken this duty, rather than risk the recurrence of neglect. The contractor also has cleansed the surface of the court daily, and I have had it, with the privies, daily disinfected with the carbolates. Every diligence has been shown in getting the sick away to the hospital. The disease has thus been confined as yet to the court in which it first broke out. The houses are most miserable ill-constructed dwellings, incorrigibly damp, dilapidated, and unwholesome; and I have now reported them under the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, as unfit to be inhabited by humam beings.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR DECEMBER, 1869. No. CLXXII. Making the necessary allowances for the extra week calculated into December of 1863 and 1868, the mortality registered in the Parish during the month has been 52 below the mean corrected mortality of the previous ten Decembers. The total number of deaths registered amounted to 437. Neither, as compared with the last two years, is the amount of public sickness, 3425 cases, to be regarded as excessive. Hooping cough has not yet fallen to the average of the month, but has not been more than half as prevalent as it was in December 1868. Scarlet fever has continued to decline in prevalence, only 50 cases having been recorded in the public practice during the five weeks, against 104 cases recorded during the four weeks of November. The mortality from this disease, however, remains stationary, 68 deaths having been registered against 56 in November (for comparison the former may be reduced by 3-, namely, to 55). This discrepancy is due to the fact that the latter part of the autumn and the winter seasons are most unfavourable to recovery from this disease, especially when the weather is damp and cold. It furnishes a striking illustration of a truth I have on many occasions endeavoured to impress, that our national mortality records furnish no fair index of the prevalence oxfluctuations of certain important kinds of disease, but that it is necessary to supplement them with records of sickness. Since my last Report, I have registered 16 fresh cases of relapsing fever, making a total of 33 cases in the two months. Two of these cases proved fatal, namely, one of the cases in Rose and Crown Court, and an old man who was removed to the Fever Hospital from Peabody Square. Of the sixteen fresh cases, eight occurred in Rose and Crown Court, one of them being a woman who went from Chapel Street to live in one of the rooms of an infected family at No. 11. Four other cases, 2 all the members in fact of one family residing in the ground floor back room of 6, Halton Place, arose from the mother of the family, related to the sick family at 11, Rose and Crown Court, visiting them when sick twice. They were all removed to the Hospital, the room was closed, and, with everything in it, thoroughly disinfected: the disease has spread no further at present. Another case occurred in a poor woman residing in a furnished lodging at 12, Gordon Court. I had some trouble in getting this woman to the Hospital, as she would not believe she bad the fever; she remained long enough with her family to infect her two children, who had been moved from there to a common lodging house in Queen's Road, from which they were taken to the Hospital. The remaining case I knew nothing about until the death was certified by the House Surgeon. The cases in Rose and Crown Court are very unfavourably situated for convalescence, some of them having had to return to the Hospital once or twice after having been discharged, having had more than one relapse. No one can wonder at this who has seen the condition of the dwellings to which they return from the comfortable Hospital ward. Fifteen people, namely, the family of a tradesman and his workpeople, narrowly escaped fatal poisoning on Christinas Eve from a mistake of an oilman supplying half a pound of Tartar emetic (tartrate of antimony and potash) in place of bi-carbonate of soda for the preparation of cakes and bread. The powder purchased having produced symptoms of poisoning in some children who had eaten some of the dough, was brought to me for analysis on the supposition that I could deal with the case under the Adulteration of Food, or the Pharmacy Act. I found it to be tartar emetic, a poison which oilmen have no business to sell and which they do not usually keep. On visiting the shop I found that the carbonate of soda was kept in an old tin vessel marked with chalk, and that it was correctly marked. Another similar tin was marked in like manner " Cream of Tartar." The contents on analysis proved to be Tartar emetic: it was out of this that the powder had been served. The explanation given me by the shopkeeper was that he never sold cream of tartar, although it was exhibited in his window, and that he had purchased this at a sale of shop fixtures at which he had bought the contents of some drawers, &c., and that it had been in his window 3 for two years. The only domestic use of cream of tartar is as a dentifrice, and for making imperial drink and ginger beer. I can with difficulty understand the recklessness of a man who would supply himself with any article thus used in so irregular a manner. The case illustrates the folly of purchasing articles of pharmacy where such articles form no part of the legitimate trade, and where therefore there can be no implied guarantee of their genuine character, for the sake of saving a penny or two upon the price which might be charged at a chemist's. I need scarcely add that I took measures for the destruction of the entire bulk of poison, which was at once given up to me for that purpose. METEOROLOGY OF DECEMBER. Thermometers 4 feet from ground.
