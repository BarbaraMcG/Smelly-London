Telephone : RODNEY 5464 To The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark. YOUR WORSHIP, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have the honour to present the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1960. Social Conditions The Metropolitan Borough of Southwark lies to the south of the River Thames the mid-stream of which forms its northern boundary. The Borough forms a boundary with Lambeth to the west, as far south as Kennington Park, to the south with Camberwell, and to the east with Bermondsey. The landward part of the Borough extends to 1,131 acres and is divided into ten Wards. The Elephant and Castle forms a landmark, roughly dividing the borough into two. The portion of the borough between the Elephant and the river is becoming increasingly devoted to wharves, warehouses, diverse industry including food factories and the printing trade and offices while the area south and south-east of the Elephant is mainly residential in character. The provision of office accommodation in the northern part of the Borough continues a trend of commercialisation which was commented upon sixty years ago by the Borough's first Medical Officer of Health in his first annual report. The momentum of development has however of late rapidly increased, not only in the north but also in the southern part of the borough where the improved aesthetic effects of the new and attractive housing estates which have been built both by this Council and the London County Council, with their associated open spaces become ever more apparent. Vital Statistics The population resident in the centre of many large cities has tended to decline during the last decade. That this is particularly true of London is brought out in the Registrar General's Preliminary Report of the Census taken on 23rd April 1961. The result is that a central London borough such as Southwark whose population was found to be 97,191 at the 1951 census now has an enumerated population of 86,175, (provisional), a decrease of 11,000 in the last ten years. Of the London boroughs only the populations of Hampstead, Kensington, Stoke Newington, and Wandsworth show increases. In Southwark there has of course been each year a natural increase, that is an excess of births over deaths, of the order of about 400, - ii - and the birth rate has been only slightly lower than that of England and Wales as a whole. The loss in population has thus been due to migration the rate of which reached a peak some five or six years ago and now would seem to show signs of diminishing. During 1960, 1,203 deaths occurred among Southwark residents, giving an adjusted death rate of 12 per 1,000 of the population compared with 11.5 both last year and for the country as a whole this year. There were forty-three infant deaths, an infant mortality rate of 26.8 per 1,000 live births compared with 28.2 last year and 21.7 for the country as a whole. Of the 43 infant deaths, 27 occurred during the first four weeks of life. There was a reduction in the still birth rate from 18 per 1,000 live and still births in 1959 to 15.9 in 1960. This is below the national figure of 19.7. There was one maternal death during the year giving a maternal death rate of 0.61 per 1,000 live and still births as compared with 0.30 for England and Wales. The principal causes of death during 1960 were diseases of the heart and circulatory system followed by maligant disease, and diseases of the respiratory system. There were no deaths from non-pulmonary tuberculosis and the deaths from the pulmonary form of the disease were only slightly higher than last year, forming 1.1 per cent of the total deaths. In contrast to the 14 deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis there were 74 deaths from cancer of the lung and bronchus, the highest figure recorded in Southwark. Thirteen of these were female deaths. Infectious Diseases The feature of infectious disease in Southwark during 1960 most worthy of comment was the occurrence of three cases of diphtheria. Apart from one case in 1958 the disease had been absent from the borough since 1952. Its reappearance was preceded and followed by the occurrence of cases in adjacent Boroughs in South East London. In association with the Divisional Medical Officer of the London County Council and his staff, the school and household contacts were investigated, with the result that eight healthy carriers were disclosed. All those found to be infected were isolated in hospital. The immunisation state of all contacts was reviewed and appropriate measures taken to give maximum protection. The experience in Southwark was that whereas none of the three children who actually suffered from the disease had been immunised the majority of the healthy carriers had received the inoculations. The infection was found to be due to the 'mitis' strain of the organism and fortunately none of the patients was very ill. The cases and carriers fell broadly into three groups as regards place of residence and school attended. It was possible to establish a link whereby infection may well have been transmitted from one of these groups to another. In common with the country as a whole, there was an increased incidence of dysentery in Southwark during the year. A special report was submitted to the Health Committee on this subject and energetic - iii - measures were taken to control the spread of this highly infectious condition. A Public Health Inspector visited each home in which the disease was known to be present, and advised parents both orally and by leaving a suitable leaflet, on preventive measures. He arranged for the necessary bacteriological investigation to be carried out. Appropriate measures were taken also by the London County Council Divisional Health staff to control the infection in schools. In all this the co-operation of both parents and teachers was readily forthcoming. As the Chief Medical Officer of the Ministry of Health states inhis Annual Report for 1959, "Only detailed attention to personal cleanliness, and, above all, the washing of hands after attendance at the toilet, combined with adequate sanitary provision in homes, schools and similar institutions, will break the cycle of infection and reduce the incidence." Another alimentary infection which calls for special mention was due to Salmonella typhi-murium phage type 2c which gave rise to cases of food poisoning of varying degrees of severity as well as to a symptomless carrier state in over fifty persons in an enclosed community, during May. The outbreak rapidly subsided after the discovery and isolation of a symptomless excretor of the organism involved, who worked in the bakery from which confectionery had been consumed by all the cases. Health Education Those of us who were in close touch with the outbreaks of poliomyelitis which occurred in this country in 1947 and the years immediately following can recall how we longed for the virus to be isolated and a vaccine prepared. Thanks to the efforts of many experts this has now been done and a vaccine of proved worth is available to persons under forty years of age free of charge under the National Health Service Act through the local health authorities. There remains the task of persuading the maximum number of persons to attend for necessary inoculations. Of six cases of poliomyelitis which occurred in Southwark during 1960 only one gave a history of having had poliomyelitis vaccine. As has already been stated, none of the three children who suffered from diphtheria had been immunised against the condition. Here then is a fundamental field for health education and during the year this department collaborated with the London County Council in the display of posters, and in issuing leaflets, to supplement the direct and personal approach of the Health Visitors. Similar action was taken in relation to alimentary infections, and the Public Health Inspectors assiduously stressed the importance of food hygiene during their visits to catering establishments. Full advantage was taken of the many facilities provided by the Central Council for Health Education, and the excellent display "Clean Air, Better Health "was exhibited in the Central Public Library, Southwark, during April. In addition, the Council co-operated with the London County Council in regard to Annual Home Safety Week publicity material being provided by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. - iv - Welfare of the Elderly The Tenth Annual Report of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee prepared by the Organising Secretary, Miss Beer, is largely reproduced at the end of this report. From it can be seen the ever increasing facilities which are available at St. Alban's Hall for people of pensionable age. The year under review is the first complete year during which the activities of the Old People's Welfare Committee have been centred at the new premises and excellent use was made of them to improve and expand the services in several directions. In addition to having the use of St. Alban's Hall, which is in the ownership of the Southwark Borough Council, the Old People's Welfare Committee receive substantial financial aid from the Council. The latest example of this, a sum of Â£1,000 to be earmarked for the provision of holidays for old people is a particularly welcome one, and will be most beneficial. Anyone who has visited old people from Southwark on holiday at Bognor and elsewhere under schemes already administered by the Old People's Welfare Committee cannot fail to be impressed by the obvious enjoyment which these holidays give, quite apart from the improvement in health which results. The services for old people provided directly by the Council through the Public Health Department were also active during the year. The incontinent laundry service was made good use of and as Mr. Lloyd, the Superintendent of the Treatment and Bathing Centre mentions in his report it was possible to introduce a Home Bathing Service for those old people who although not requiring the services of the District Nurse, were yet in need of assistance as regards maintaining the cleanliness of their person. In addition to Mr. Lloyd, the Public Health Inspectors generally, paid many visits to old people during the year, and took action to alleviate conditions under which many of them were living. Despite the wide range of services available in Southwark for the welfare of the aged it still proved necessary to arrange for the compulsory removal to institutions of no fewer than four old people, the highest number for some years. Two were dealt with under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act 1948 and two under the National Assistance (Amendment) Act 1951, two going to hospital, and two to Part III accommodation. It is always an anxious decision to initiate procedure of this sort particularly in regard to frail ambulant old persons, who cannot appreciate just how insanitary the conditions under which they are living have become in contrast to what they have been accustomed to in previous years, nor just how incapable they are of looking after themselves in safety and comfort. An assessment of the position can only be made after detailed investigation of all the circumstances. In the two Amendment cases there was of course supporting medical evidence that admission to hospital was urgently necessary. - V - Housing Reference has been made to the decrease in population which has taken place in Southwark during the last ten years, of the order of 11.4 per cent. The provisional figures in the Preliminary Report on the 19S1 Census show that during the same period the number of private dwellings increased by 8.3 per cent, from 23,082 in 1951 to 25,001 in 1S31, and that the number of private households fell by 10.2 per cent from 32,052 in 1951 to 28,783 in 1931. These figures indicate some easing of the problem of overcrowding in the borough. They are supported by the figure of families remaining on the register as overcrowded which in 1952 was 732 and in I960 was 280. Despite this improvement a substantial volume of serious overcrowding remains with its concomitant danger to the health of young children as well as, in many instances, to the mental health of their parents. A great deal of work was undertaken by the Public Health Inspectors to improve housing conditions by dealing with sanitary defects. Work was carried out in default wherever necessary. Clean Air A considerable portion of the time of Mr. Stubbs and the Public Health Inspectors was devoted to Clean Air, and it can be seen from Mr. Stubbs' report that much progress was made during the year. The late Mr. Councillor J.J. Sheen. The entire staff of the Public Health Department experienced a sense of loss as the result of the death on 13th January, 1961, of Mr. Councillor J.J. Sheen, Chairman of the Public Health Committee for so many years. Councillor Sheen worked hard for Public Health in Southwark and he was held in high regard by all with whom he came into contact. Conclusion My thanks are due to the Chairmen and Members of the various Committees for their support and encouragement and for their interest in public health matters throughout the year. I am most grateful to the other Chief Officers for their co-operation. I also wish to express my appreciation and thanks to the Chief Public Health Inspector, Mr. H. Archer, to Mr. E. A. Clark, Senior Clerk, as well as to the entire staff of the Public Health Department for their enthusiastic support and assistance.

Only 12 cases were admitted to hospital. There were no deaths. Whooping Cough One hundred and eighteen cases of Whooping Cough occurred, an increase of 58 from 1959 - 82 were under the age of 5 years, and of these 13 were under the age of one year. One child under one year died from this disease. Erysipelas Of the 10 cases of Erysipelas which were notified, one was over 65 years of age and 9 were between 45 and 64 years of age. Meningococcal Infection Four cases were notified, two under 3 years of age and two between 4 and 9 years. Two children died from this disease, one being under one year of age. Ophthalmia Neonatorum Two children were reported as suffering from this condition during the year. Diphtheria Three confirmed cases of diphtheria occurred in Southwark in October and November in children in the six to seven age group, none of whom had been immunised. The children attended three different schools. Investigation of home and school contacts disclosed the presence of eight healthy carriers the majority of whom had been I immunised. All of the cases and carriers were isolated in hospital. There were no deaths. The organism responsible for the infection, although virulent, was of mitis type. At Christmas time a child admitted to hospital from an adjacent Borough was found to be suffering from Diphtheria and immediately transferred to an isolation hospital. Essential routine measures were immediately taken at the original hospital and there was no further spread. - 10 - Poliomyelitis Two paralytic and four non-paralytic cases of poliomyelitis were notified. With the exception of one of the paralytic cases, a man aged twenty-two years, all of the patients were under five years of age. In only one instance was the residual paralyses at all extensive. The cases occurred during May, September, November and December. Only one of the children, a non-paralytic case, gave a history of having received poliomyelitis vaccine. There were no deaths. Dysentery Dysentery, due to infection with shigella sonnei was again prevalent during the year, 686 cases being confirmed bacteriologically compared with 341 during the previous year. 291 were under five years of age, 211 between five and fifteen years of age, and 184 over the age of fifteen years. Zymotic Enteritis There were only 2 cases of Enteritis during the year. This condition is notifiable in Southwark during the quarter July to September inclusive for children under 5 years of age. Pneumonia Forty cases of Pneumonia were notified, as compared with 80 for the previous year. Twenty-eight of these occurred over the age of 45 years. Puerperal Pyrexia All of the 16 notifications of Puerperal Pyrexia were received from hospital. Thirty-one cases were notified in 1959. Encaphalitis One case of Infective Encephalitis occurred in a child of four years of age. There were no cases of post-infectious Encephalitis. Scabies Only the first case of Scabies in a household in any four-week period is notifiable in London and 37 such cases were so notified, an increase of 16 from the previous year. Food Poisoning An institutional outbreak which occurred in June involved a total of fifty-four cases. The majority of the remaining cases of food poisoning occurred singly. A man and wife were notified as sufferins from the condition, as was a father and his three year old child. The institutional outbreak was found to be due to Salmonella typhimurium phage type 2C. Whole hearted co-operation was forthcoming - 11 - from the staff in question. The presence of a symptomless excretor in a bakery was considered to have triggered off the outbreak. Of the remaining cases six were due to Salmonella typhi-murium, Salmonella Heidelberg and Salmonella Brandenberg were isolated each in one case, while no organisms were found in the remaining nine cases. Smallpox Three families who had been in contact with a case of smallpox in another borough were kept under careful surveillance but were found to be unaffected. Vaccination was arranged where necessary. LOSS OF EARNINGS - LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1959 This Act enables local authorities to pay compensation for loss of earnings in special circumstances to contacts of infectious diseases who are required by the Medical Officer of Health to stop work in order to prevent the spread of infection. It was not necessary to implement this provision during 1960. - 12 - IMMUNISATION I am indebted to Dr. W.H.

Lloyd, T. D. ) There was again a considerable decrease in the number of treatments for verminous conditions of the person carried out at the Centre during the year. The overall figures for treatments of these conditions for both adults and children, were 1,387. Of these, 585 treatments were in respect of children of school age for head lice only. No school children were found to be infested with body lice. It must be remembered, that, in addition to Southwark schools, children now also attend the Centre from some Lambeth and Bermondsey schools. A comparison with the number of treatments for verminous conditions given at the Centre in 1938 and referred to in the annual report for that year, will give some indication of the changed aspects of this problem. In 1938 there was a total of 8,277 attendances at the Centre for treatment, and of this number, 5, 885 treatments were given to children of school age. In regard to scabies, only 424 treatments of 187 individuals were undertaken during the year. When the numbers treated during the war years are considered - in 1943, over 12,000 treatments were given for this condition (then often referred to colloquially as "Shelter rash") - it will be seen that this problem is now considerably reduced. Bed bugs and other domestic pests are still with us, although to a much less degree than in the pre-war years. The use of modern insecticides with their long lasting residual effects, have been one of the main factors in reducing infestations of bed bugs. In addition, because of the initial disinfestation carried out on removal, each family re-housed by the Borough Council is assured that they can start off in their new homes free from these unwelcome pests. The incontinent laundry service continues to assist many aged and sick persons who have the additional burden of incontinence added to their other cares. Over 40,000 lbs. weight of these soiled items from Southwark and Lambeth cases were laundered during the year. The laundry is delivered the day after collection - washed, dried, ironed and ready for immediate use. If necessary, up to three collections are made each week. A home bathing service for aged and enfeebled persons was commenced in August. This service is intended for those aged and housebound persons who, whilst not requiring medical or nursing attention, do require assistance in bathing themselves. - 19 - Infectious Disease Cases: Enquiries and Visits Total - 859 as under: Scarlet Fever 67 Poliomyelitis 11 Dysentery (bacilliary) 608 Smallpox contacts 3 Food Poisoning 31 Erysipelas 9 Meningococcal infections 8 Diphtheria 17 Revisits 105 Disinfection following infectious diseases Rooms treated (Formalin solution) 165 Library books treated 198 Other disinfection, Tuberculosis, etc. 9 Treatment of Verminous and Infected Articles (including precautionary disinfestation) Verminous articles treated Infected articles treated Beds 320 114 Palliasses 321 50 Bolsters 122 9 Pillows 957 494 Cushions 29 11 Blankets 1,107 510 Sheets 937 239 Quilts 613 90 Other articles (clothing, etc.) 10,699 508 Rehousing Precautionary disinfestation of soft goods and bedding (including 38 families rehoused by L.

Twenty-six bath samples were analysed by the Public Analyst. It is standard practice to record the number of bathers who have used the bath prior to the sample being taken and the number of bathers in the pool at the time of sampling, and the appearance of the water. In 21 cases, the appearance was clear and as regards the other five, the baths were being used by an unusually large number of bathers, when the appearance was slightly cloudy. The analyses, however, revealed bacterial counts ranging from under 5 to 4100 per ml. and free chlorine 0.4 to 1.6 parts per mis.

It is the practice to investigate the conditions for nuisances in accordance with the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 ; the owners of the sites are contacted and the London County Council is informed having regard to the powers in the Town and County Planning Act, 1947. For the purpose of regulating the use of movable dwellings within the borough, the Council, from October 1st 1960, had powers to grant for such periods as they think fit (not exceeding three years in respect of any one licence), licences authorising persons to use, or allow to be used, as sites for movable dwellings, land occupied by those persons within the borough. These powers have been delegated to the Housing and Town Planning Committee. OFFICE ACT, 1960 The Office Act, 1960, which makes provision for health, welfare and safety in offices, received the Royal Assent on 29th July, 1960, and will come into force on 1st January, 1962. The Act enables the Secretary of State to make regulations specifying the standards as to the structure, arrangement and operation to be applied in offices for the protection of the health, safety and welfare of persons employed therein. The Secretary of State may also provide by regulation for restricting the employment of women in offices after childbirth. Before making any regulations the Secretary of State is required to consult such organisations as appear to him to represent the interests concerned and the draft regulations will be laid before Parliament for approval by resolution of each House. The occupier of any office is required to keep fixed in a permanent place any prescribed abstracts of the Act or regulations made thereunder. Occupiers are required to notify the local authority (Metropolitan Borough Councils) in the prescribed form, of any accident which causes loss of life to anyone employed in the premises or disables any such person for more than three days from earning the full wages at the work at which he was employed. These reports need not be sent in respect of accidents of which notice is required to - 32 - be sent under the Factories Act, 1937 or the Mines and Quarry Act, 1954. It is the duty of the local authority to enforce the provisions of the Act and regulations within their area, and any duly authorised officer of the authority may enter premises for the purpose of examinations and enquiries. As regards offices in factories, the Act ana the regulations other than those relating to sanitary conveniences and employment of women after childbirth are to be enforced by Inspectors appointed by the Ministry of Labour. Any person, who, in pursuance of powers conferred by the Act, is admitted to an office, discloses any information with regard to the trade or business carried on other than in the performance of his duty, is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding Â£100 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months. Where agreements or leases prevent the execution of alterations necessary for compliance with the Act or regulations, the County Court may make an Order setting aside or modifying the terms of the agreement. The Court may also make Orders concerning the allocation of the cost of the alterations between the persons concerned. Persons guilty of an offence under the Act for which no express penalty is provided by the Act are liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding Â£50, ana, if the contravention continues after conviction, they are liable again on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding Â£5 for each day on which the contravention is continued. Where a person is convicted, the Court may order steps to be taken to remedy the matter in respect of which the contravention occurred. In the case of a body corporate, any director, manager, secretary or other similar officer may be deemed to be guilty of an offence as well as the body corporate if the offence is proved to be with his consent, connivance or neglect. NOISE ABATEMENT ACT, 1960 Metropolitan borough councils already have powers under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, to deal with an " excessive or unreasonable or unnecessary noise or vibration and which is injurious or dangerous to health." These words are amended by the new Noise Abatement Act, 1960, which came into operation in November, 1960, and the noise or vibration must simply be a nuisance. What constitutes a nuisance is , however, a matter of personal opinion which the magistrate must decide. Three or more persons aggrieved by noise nuisance may themselves complain to a Magistrates' Court. The Act does not apply to noise or vibration caused by aircraft. Section 2 of the Act deals with devices for amplifying sound, and prohibits their use in streets for any purpose between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m. (except in certain defined circumstances) and at any other time for advertising any trade, business or entertainment, with certain - 33 - ceptions relating to the sale of perishable foodstuffs provided it gives no reasonable cause for annoyance. Proceedings for an offence under the section may be instituted by the local authority. The Act does not affect existing bye-laws and the Council have made five for good rule and government which deal with noise from music near public buildings and hospitals, noisy shouting by hawkers, wireless loud speakers in or adjoining streets, and noisy animals. NUISANCES FROM DUST The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1960, empowers borough councils to deal with " any dust or other airborne particles caused by any trade, business, process or manufacture, and being a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health, " as a nuisance within the meaning of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. It will be a defence in any proceedings to show that, having regard to costs and local conditions and circumstances, the best practicable means had been taken to prevent or counteract the effect of the dust or airborne particles. SALES OF CORROSIVE POISONS TO CHILDREN In 1959, the result of confidential enquiries made regarding the sale of corrosive poisons within the borough were forwarded to the Association of Municipal Corporations, with a request that in view of this evidence further steps should be taken to secure the prohibition of sale of corrosive poisons to children.The Secretary of the Association replied that the matter had been considered by the Association's Police Committee, at whose request an enquiry was made by a number of police authorities on the lines of that conducted by this Council. The results were placed before the Police Committee to assist then in their further consideration of the matter. Estimates of the number of children asking to be sold corrosive poisons varied widely from authority to authority (depending in part, of course, on the size of the authority) and many authorities stated that they had found difficulty in obtaining detailed and accurate information, because requests from children to be served (and actual sales) were not recorded. There was very little evidence of accidents arising from these sales and the impression was received that authorities generally did not consider that amending legislation was required. It is understood that the Pharmaceutical Society and the National Pharmaceutical Union advise their members to refuse sales to children and this advice is normally followed. In the light of this information the Police Committee did not feel able to support the Council's - 34 - FIREWORKS : SALE TO CHILDREN The Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee was requested by this Council to give further consideration to the possibili of again making representations to the Home Office to restrict the sale of fireworks to children to a short period immediately preceding the 5th November, or alternatively, that consideration might be given to dealing with the matter as it affects London by way of a clause in the next London County Council (General Powers) Bill. The General Purposes Sub-Committee of the Standing Joint Committee reviewed the legislative provisions concerning the sale and discharge of fireworks, but felt that, in the absence of any substantial volume of fresh evidence, they could not recommend the Joint Committee to take action on the lines suggested by the Council. VACANT SITES The London County Council (General Powers) Bill of 1961 contains a Clause empowering metropolitan borough councils to enter any open land in their area which is derelict, unsightly or neglected and carry out thereon such works as appear to them to be necessary for securing that the land is put in a condition which is not detrimental to the amenities of the neighbourhood. In this connection, many Notices have been served and in one case legal proceedings have been instituted resulting in unoccupied sites being cleaned and tidied but the conditions recur from time to time. A number of sites have been suitably fenced as the result of the action taken. REMOVAL OF AIR RAID SHELTERS At the end of 1959, the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee was requested to urge the Home Office to give more sympathetic consideration to applications for the removal of brick domestic surface shelters, and suggesting that representation should be made to the appropriate authority for the removal of air raid shelters from the Council's Housing Estates. The Standing Joint Committee felt that the situation would be met if the Home Office were advised of these views, as the experience of constitutent Councils varied, some having no difficulty at all. The Civil Defence (Shelter) (Maintenance) Regulations 1956, made it a function of local authorities to take such steps as are - 35 - practicable to maintain existing shelters and, as stated in Civil Defence Circular 8/1956, the policy of the Government is to preserve all sound existing air raid shelters except where, in a particular case, there are some compelling grounds for demolition. COLLECTION OF REFUSE FROM RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS Arising out of the Council's powers to control refuse storage accommodation in accordance with the provisions of Section 24 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1959, a code recommended by the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee which deals with three main methods of storing and collecting household refuse was adopted. They involve the provision of dust-bins for each household, communal refuse storage containers, and communal refuse storage containers with chutes. The code provides guidance on the suitability of the above systems for different types of residential buildings and gives detailed recommendations for various parts of a refuse chute system, for example, chutes, hoppers and container chambers. TRADING IN STREETS BY LICENSED STREET TRADERS New Bye-laws were made by the Council in respect of street trading and were confirmed by the Secretary of State, Home Office, and came into force on the first day of October, 1950. These Byelaws relate to the general control of street trading. The hygiene control in relation to food trading from stalls, vehicles, etc. is covered by the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960. - 36 - AIR POLLUTION (Smoke Abatement Officer - Mr. G. Stubbs) An important feature of the figures recorded by the Council's instruments was the considerable decrease in the amount of smoke. There is little doubt that this result was mainly due to the continued reduction in the consumption of domestic coal. There was also a general decrease in the deposited matter both in the industrial and residential areas of the Borough, and the sulphur dioxide figures from the lead peroxide instruments and the daily volumetric apparatus have shown an improvement. During the year, several complaints were received of smoke from the burning of trade wastes in incinerators. On investigation it was generally found that the incinerators needed renovation or were being overloaded. Two incinerators were renovated and one firm decided to discontinue burning their trade wastes. Many of the smoke emissions from factory chimneys were found to be due to excessive demands on the boilers or to mechanical faults and in all cases the management concerned took action to abate the nuisance. An exhibit " Clean Air - Better Health " produced by the Central Council for Health Education was on display in the main entrance of the Central Library, Walworth Road, in April, and was an extremely useful piece of publicity. A meeting was held at the Town Hall on 15th September, 1960, to ascertain the up-to-date position in regard to the availability of smokeless fuels. Mr. Councillor H. Stillman presided at the meeting. Representatives of the National Coal Board, South East Gas Board, Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation, Society of Coal Merchants, local merchants and the Press were present. The general conclusion arising from the discussion was that there was a sufficient supply of smokeless fuels to meet the demands of any smoke control areas likely to be established in the Borough within the foreseeable future, provided such fuels as Sebrite, Gloco, Cleanglow, etc. were acceptable as well as Coalite and Rexco. Arising from this report on the availability of smokeless fuels the Council decided to proceed with a detailed survey of the area bounded by Walworth Road, Trafalgar Street, Dawes Street, Portland Street and Westmoreland Road, with the object of making a Smoke Control Order. Provisional approval had been given by the Minister of Housing and Local Government to the proposal in 1958. The area is mainly residential and covers 38 acres. A detailed house to house survey of the area is now in progress and the response by the residents has so far been one of general approval. - 37 - A preliminary letter was sent to occupiers outlining the scheme and informing them that the Public Health Inspectors would be calling to inspect the fireplaces etc. and would detail any adaptations required to comply with a Smoke Control Order. Letters were sent to owners in the area and to the Gas Board, Electricity Board and other interested bodies asking for co-operation. During the year, eleven notifications were received of proposals to install new furnaces and plans and specifications in respect of two other installations have been submitted for approval and are the subject of negotiations. The Council has in use two standard Deposit Gauges, three Lead Peroxide Instruments and one Smoke and Volumetric Sulphur-Dioxide apparatus. The Central Electricity Generating Board in March discontinued the use of their two Standard Deposit Gauges in Southwark but retained a Lead Peroxide Instrument on the jetty of the Bankside Power Station. During the year 18 complaints were received regarding smoke emission, 207 special observations and inspections were made by the Inspector and 14 Intimation Notices were issued. It is pleasing to record that the managements were co-operative on all occasions and it was not necessary to institute legal proceedings. - 38 - Deposited matter at following sites:- 1960 Rainfall (inches) BANKSIDE WALWORTH ROAD Mean Daily Concentration of Sulphur Dioxide parts per 100 million Smoke mgms/ per 100 cub. mtrs.

ICE CREAM There are 295 ice-cream dealers and 10 manufacturers in this borough, an increase of 10 dealers, since last year. Most of the sellers sold only pre-packed ice cream, obtained from the large manufacturers. Twenty-seven samples of ice-cream were taken with the following results 23 samples. Grade I 4 samples, Grade II In addition : Twenty samples were chemically examined for compliance with the prescribed standards of composition, and all were found to be satisfactory. Periodical inspections were made to all premises and copies of the Public Analyst's reports on samples taken were forwarded to the vendors concerned. DESIGNATED MILK The following Licences were issued under the Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949 to 1954 and Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 to 1953 :- Dealers' Licences for Pasteurised milk 130 Sterilised milk 137 Tuberculin Tested milk 87 48 Dealers' Supplementary Licences for Pasterised Milk 16 Sterilised Milk 17 Tuberculin Tested Milk 15 Twenty-three samples of Designated milks were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination, all of which satisfied the prescribed tests. Nineteen samples of Pasteurised Milk supplied to local schools were also examined by the Public Analyst, and the London County Council were informed of the results which were satisfactory in each case. MILK AND DAIRIES (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1959 There were 146 registered milk distributors in the borough, whilst the number of distributors purveying milk in the borough from registered premises elsewhere was 19. 256 inspections of Milk shops and Dairies were made during the year. PUBLIC HEALTH (CONDENSED MILK) REGULATIONS, 1959 Four samples of condensed milk were purchased for analysis and all were certified to comply with the regulations. SLAUGHTERHOUSES There are now no slaughterhouses in the borough. CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS There are 421 catering establishments in the borough. These include riverside snackbars, cafes, coffee stalls, mobile snack bars, public house restaurants, and industrial canteens. All have received systematic inspection and close supervision during the year, and a satisfactory standard has been maintained. REGISTRATION OF FOOD PREMISES (Food and Drugs Act, 1955) There are now 91 premises registered under Section 16 of the above Act for the purpose of the Preparation or Manufacture of Sausages or Potted, Pressed, Pickled or Preserved Food intended for sale. - 49 - BAKEHOUSES There were 16 Bakehouses in use of which 3 were Basement Bakehouses. Forty inspections were made by the Public Health Inspectors. MEAT (STAINING & STERILISATION) REGULATIONS, 1960 These Regulations came into force in November 1960 and require all butchers' and imported meat which is unfit for human consumption to be stained or sterilised before distribution. Supplies of such meat to medical schools etc., for instructional purposes and to manufacturing chemists are not affected by the Regulations and exemption is allowed for unfit meat for zoos, etc., if transported in locked containers. AUTHORISED OFFICERS (MEAT INSPECTION) REGULATIONS, 1960 From August 1960, Councils were enabled to authorise officers holding the Royal Society of Health Certificate in Meat Inspection to act as meat inspectors. ARSENIC IN FOOD (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS, 1960 These amending Regulations increase from 2 to 5 parts per million the maximum amount of arsenic permitted in brewers' yeast for the manufacture of yeast products. The amendment operated from December 1960. SKIMMED MILK WITH NON-MILK FAT REGULATIONS, 1960 The above Regulations, made at the end of the year, will impose, from September 1961, requirements and prohibitions on the labelling and advertising of certain specified foods having the appearance of liquid, condensed or dried milk and containing skimmed milk and nonmilk fat. MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) REGULATIONS, 1960 These Regulations, which will come into force on January 1st 1961, make certain modifications regarding the area of the issue and availability of dealers' licences and the sampling and testing of - 50 - milk. The licence period is extended from one to five years and a 'pre-packed licence ' is introduced for the sale of milk obtained by dealers in containers in which it is to be supplied to consumers. FOOD HYGIENE (DOCKS, CARRIERS, ETC.) REGULATIONS, 1960 The Pood Hygiene Regulations, 1955, (now replaced by the Pood Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960) do not apply to docks, warehouses, cold stores, carriers' premises and a number of other special types of premises at which food is handled, because it was felt that the operations taking place there necessitated a modification of the provisions applying to food premises generally. The Food Hygiene (Docks, Carriers, etc.) Regulations, I960, have now been made prescribing requirements to secure the hygienic handling of food at docks and other premises. They require that places, vessels and vehicles used for the reception or movement of food are made available in a clean condition, and contain requirements as to the cleanliness of workers handling food which is not completely protected by its packing, the action to be taken where workers suffer from or are carriers of certain infections liable to cause food poisoning, requirements as to construction, maintenance and repair of premises and provision of sanitary conveniences, water supply and washing facilities, and provisions for the giving of certificates of exemption from the requirements regarding a water supply and washing facilities if through special circumstances compliance cannot reasonably be required. FOOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS, 1955. USE OF TOBACCO WHILST HANDLING OPEN FOOD. An appeal by the Council to the High Court was made relating to the Food Hygiene Regulations in a case for failing to refrain from the use of tobacco while handling open food, which case had been dismissed by the Newington Magistrates. The Justices found, inter alia, that the defendant had served tomatoes from a stall when there was an unlighted cigarette in his mouth, which had been half smoked and had gone out. The Appeal was before the Lord Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Ashworth and Mr. Justice Elwes and they held that the defendant's conduct amounted to " using tobacco ". The defendant did not appear ; Mr. George Mercer appeared for the Council. In reply to the Lord Chief Justice's question as to what had been meant by the defendant saying that he had changed over to shag, Mr. Mercer said that shag was a tobacco which one rolled oneself. It did 51 not contain saltpetre and other ingredients usually in official cigarettes and when one ceased to puff it went out. The defendant was saying that he knew the cigarette was not alight and had changed over to shag, having regard to those advantages. Giving judgment, the Lord Chief Justice said that Regulation 9 of the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955, dealt with personal cleanliness. It provided: "A person who engages in the handling of food shall while so engaged (a) keep as clean as may be reasonably practicable all parts of his person which may be liable to come into contact with the food" and clause (b) referred to clothing. Then, after refraining from spitting, it provided that he also had to refrain from the use of tobacco (including snuff) "while he is handling any open food or is in any room in which there is open food." The justices dismissed the information because in their opinion, the fact that a person had an unlighted cigarette in his mouth in no way militated against his personal cleanliness, and because " it would be straining the meaning of the English language to say that a person who had an unlighted cigarette in his mouth was using tobacco." The justices had thought that tobacco was only being used when it was either smoked or chewed. His Lordship had come to the conclusion that too narrow a view had been taken by the justices. He went on to say that there was no purpose in considering all the possibilities that might arise when enforcing this regulation but taking the fact that the defendant was serving tomatoes with a half-smoked cigarette which had gone out, in his mouth, he was clearly using tobacco. One of the mischiefs at which the regulation was aimed was ash falling on to food and that could happen when a half-smoked cigarette had gone out. His Lordship was not deciding whether having a brand new cigarette which had never been smoked in the mouth was using tobacco. Mr. Justice Ashworth and Mr. Justice Elwes agreed. The Court accordingly ordered that the case be remitted to the Newington Justices with a direction to convict the defendant. The case came before the Newington Magistrates again on the 30th November, 1960, when the defendant who appeared, was fined the sum of thirty shillings and ordered to pay ten shillings costs in respect of both hearings in the Magistrates' Court. IMPORTATION OF EGG PRODUCTS Following representations by the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee to the Minister of Health that there should be a complete embargo on the importation of egg products until a satisfactory 52 method of preventing the danger of infection is devised, a working group was formed to attempt to devise a solution to the difficulties to be overcome before pasteurisation of bulked egg on a commercial scale can be regarded as satisfactory.

W., Organising Secretary of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee : - " We present the Tenth Annual Report of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee for the year 1960/61 and are glad to show increased activity and increased registration of old people whom we have helped. Our gratitude is due to the Borough Council for its generous grants and for its support and ready co-operation at all times. Especially we would like to thank the Mayor for his interest and encouragement, and all those who have materially helped us with donations and practical assistance. We are particularly fortunate in having the whole hearted support of our M.P. , Mr. R.J. Gunter, who in the turmoil of parliamentary life, usually finds time to look in at our meetings, and if he is prevented, delegates the function to Mrs. Gunter, who equally shows a personal interest in the welfare of our old people. This is the first complete year at St. Alban's Hall and, looking back, we are able to assess the measure of our aims and the degree to which they have been fulfilled. To relieve want among the elderly, whether by our own means or by alerting the relevant statutory or voluntary organisation ; to serve in their homes those who, being disabled or too ill, cannot come to us ; to visit the lonely and encourage them to join in our activities ; at all times to give advice to all old people on problems which, with their limited knowledge of the outside world, may seem insoluble ; in a word, to give a sense of normality to the lives of those who are growing old, and make them all feel that they are still members of an active community. When we survey the activities of the past year, and hear the appreciation of the old people as they express their faith in us, we feel that we have gone far towards achieving our ends, although we know that there are many more old people who must be reached. The Borough Council has compiled a list of all old age pensioners in Southwark and we are in the process of correlating our own lists with these, to ensure that every possible case of need may be visited. But, for this gigantic task, involving thousands of people, time and personnel are necessary. All our usual activities go on apace. The restaurant attracts its quota of daily clients, whether for morning coffee, midday dinner or afternoon tea. The television room is popular in the afternoon especially when there is a good sports or race meeting. The afternoon classes in dressmaking and handcrafts are still well attended. The choir does excellent work and has distinguished itself at the recent Festival. Once a week, under the leadership of Mr. Harrison, of the London City Mission, the 0ver-60 Fellowship holds a hymn-singing rally which is much appreciated, judging from the lolling waves of sound emanating from the music room. 58 - St. Alban's Association now numbers over 500 active members who share in all these activities as well as the entertainments and holidays organised for them. But our service is not limited to just these old people. What is important is to help all elderly people who have some problems, especially those who through need or loneliness, feel that their span of happiness in life is over. We encourage them to come to St. Alban's Hall, to meet and make friends, and to take part in classes and entertainments ; if they are shy and do not want to join in, they can read the papers over a cup of tea - anything to get away from the four walls of their room. And if they cannot come to us, we must go to them. There are many who are visited regularly, some of whom we are able to bring in now and again for a change of environment. In certain cases we collect pensions and disburse them on behalf of the incapacitated, pay the rent, gas and electricity, install fire-guards and special gas cookers. This is perhaps a fitting place to pay tribute to the statutory organisations with whom we are constantly in touch on behalf of the old people, and thanks to whose co-operation we can make the old people happier. Visiting We have been fortunate this year in having more visitors available for this most essential side of our work, but we still have room for more people who would be willing to give up just a few hours a week. How often does an almoner or a doctor ring us asking for services to an old person, adding" She lives alone "or" She feels so lonely ". And yet sometimes the lonely are the most difficult to approach. Unhappy experience of the world or the habit of solitude over a long period, and perhaps mistrust, may cause reticence until the old person realises that here is a friend, and the pent-up thoughts over private worries are unloosed to a sympathetic listener. A quiet talk to such a visitor is a landmark in the drab life of a lonely and perhaps troubled old person, and if it can be a regular visit, will mean an event to look forward to every week. The University of Hull students have formed a Social Service Organisation, so far some 200 strong, who are devoting regular times to the visiting of old people. If there is scope for this in Hull, how much more is it necessary in a borough like Southwark, which counts fourteen thousand old age pensioners. We have, in fact, two sides to our visiting : the case worker who investigates the problems and the background of an old person in an endeavour to find a solution to a difficult situation, and the regular visitor who means so much to the old lady who, from disability or old age, cannot leave her room and longs for some contact with the world outside. Restaurant and Meals-on-Wheels Service The restaurant at St. Alban's Hall is still very popular and serves on an average 250 meals per day. The warm, cheerful atmosphere, enlivened by music, attracts the old people, whether they come just for dinner, served at 12.15 p.m., or whether they come earlier for - 59 - coffee and stay on, tempted by the opportunity of a chat with friends to linger for tea and television. To those who live quite alone or perhaps in a not very congenial family set-up, this is like home, where they can please themselves, with all the amenities of companionship. On the notice board are the announcements of concerts, whist drives, and in the summer, outings, and during the day many make their way to the office to pay their instalments on holidays or to seek advice on something which bothers them. The Meals-on-Wheels service has been expanded to the extent that more transport and containers have had to be supplied. There is a five-day service to all but the northern area of the borough ; this is worked by the W.V. S. who unfortunately lack the personnel to deliver more than four days a week. This is an exacting and tiring service and we are fortunate in our staff for the devotion they show. Not only do they deliver dinners, sometimes climbing five floors in the old buildings, but they take a personal interest in the welfare of the old people, reporting back to the office any special needs they have noticed on which the Secretary should take action, i.e., cases of sickness which must be reported to the doctor, or cases of unhappiness where a visit could help. The luncheon club at the Women's University Settlement continues to be well patronised and the one inaugurated at Quinn Square just over a year ago proves that its existence is justified. The total number of meals cooked and served in the restaurant or sent out to the luncheon clubs and the housebound was 88,606 for the year, an increase of about 17,000 over last year. We should like once more to express our appreciation of the help given by Mr. Bloomfield and his drivers and of their ready co-operation often in circumstances of difficulty. Transport As always, we have had many requests for transport and have sometimes found it difficult to fulfil them through lack of voluntary drivers. So much happiness depends on a wife, herself disabled, being able to visit from time to time her husband in a hospital outside London. An invalid for whom we have arranged a convalescent holiday by the sea - it may be her very first holiday (and that has happened) has two-fold enjoyment if she can go from door to door and is not buffeted about in public transport, and she is happier in feeling that we care so much for her comfort. During this past year the London County Council Welfare Department has allowed us the use of a coach on Fridays to bring in to the centre as many of our housebound old people as we can. We are grateful for this gesture, which has brought happiness to many - thev come - 60 - in during the morning, have dinner and spend the afternoon making friends and chatting over a cup of tea. We are very grateful to Mr. Bowden for all his spare-time driving and should welcome offers from other voluntary drivers. Chiropody During the past year this section of our work has undergone considerable change, Chiropody has now become the financial responsibility of the Welfare authority, in this case, of the London County Council, and in January of this year treatment became free to all old age pensioners receiving National Assistance. There have been changes in our staff, too : last summer Miss Addiscott, who so ably organised the clerical work, fell ill and had to give it up. Mr. Tertis felt obliged to give more time to his other clinic and handed over the work at St. Alban's Hall to Mrs. Bond, who worked so devotedly among the old people. Then a great blow fell - she had to leave because of ill-health and died very shortly afterwards. Mr. Tertis then came back to us and now shares the work of the clinics with Mrs. Pearson. We are fortunate to have Mrs. Waddilow, who has taken over the services of Miss Addiscott and also gives general clerical help. Her assistance is of great value and is much appreciated. After all the difficulties brought about by these changes the department is getting back to normal, but the demand for domiciliary chiropody still exceeds our possibilities, and a two months' wait is usual, through lack of personnel and transport. We are unable to expand because of inadequate grants, yet this service means so much to the old people ; comfortable walking gives an incentive to living, even those whose life is bounded within their small homes. We wish very much that we could do more for them. The total number of treatments given throughout the year was 2,329. Outing and Entertainments There have been many outings during the past year. In the summer there were coach day excursions to Bexhill, Windsor, Clacton and Folkestone, also to Albourne, Bletchley and East Wittering, in each of which places the old people were the guests of the local Women's Institute for tea. We are greatly indebted to these friends for their unfailing hospitality and their constant support of our work among the old people of Southwark. Among the entertainments to which parties were escorted were shows at the Coliseum, the Adelphi Theatre, also the Cinderella Ice Show at Wembley. - 61 - On Wednesday evenings there has been a variety of entertainment, including whist drives, quizzes and occasionally displays of dancing by children. These latter have proved most enjoyable and we are very grateful to the organisers and to the children for their kind thought in giving the old people pleasure. There was, too, a memorable occasion when Messrs. Singers staged a fashion parade, to the great delight of the ladies, and no doubt of the gentlemen too. To all who have provided entertainment in any form, we express our deep appreciation. Visitors This year has set a milestone in the history of Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee through the publicity we have received ; the eyes of the outside world have been attracted to the achievements of the Committee and we have had many visitors to see what we are doing and how we are doing it. Fulham Borough Council sent a group headed by the Mayor ; representatives from the government of Victoria, Australia, themselves faced with the problem of ageing people ; representatives from the Public Health Department of Jersey; a group of Cambridge students attached to the Pembroke Mission in Walworth ; students from Nigeria ; a group from the London School of Economics and a group studying Social Science - these are just some of the visitors who have come to St. Alban's Hall during the past year, and in addition we have been happy to welcome the Bishop of Southwark. Seaside Holidays On Saturday, May 14th, 142 old people went by coach to Bognor for two weeks. The weather was fairly good, by last year's standards, and the hoteliers with their usual co-operation helped to make the holiday a great success. As an expression of thanks for all their kindness they were invited to St. Alban's Hall on November 10th. There were twenty-three guests and they were entertained to high tea by the staff, helpers and members of the Committee. The Chairman of the Executive Committee presented them with the coat-of-arms of Southwark, as a gesture of gratitude, and we understand that our gift now hangs in the Council Offices at Bognor. On September 11th a party of old people left for a seven days' coach tour with Morecambe as a centre. This was a new venture in that the Committee organised the holiday but did not subsidise it. It was a great success and we hope to repeat the venture this year. Jumble Sales Several jumble sales have been organised during the year by energetic members of St. Alban's Hall Association. They are always well patronised and the proceeds help to swell our funds. We are always grateful for gifts of clothes, men's in particular, which are saleable or which may be given to old people in need. - 62 - Open Day On Saturday, November 5th, St. Alban's Hall was open to friends and local residents interested in the work being done among the old people in the borough. Many organisations were represented, also doctors, hospital almoners and councillors. By 2.30 p.m. the main hall was already filling with visitors, among whom we were pleused to welcome the Mayor and Mayoress. One side of the hall had been tastefully arranged with the work produced by the dressmaking and craft classes - a display which did great credit to the instructress and to the skill and industry of our old people. On Monday and Friday afternoons they work away in the upstairs room and their beautiful handwork and sewing were a revelation to those who just know that the classes take place. Tea was served during the afternoon while the hall buzzed with the conversation of some two hundred people who were invited to circulate in the building. Room was cleared in the main hall for an Old Time Dancing Display by the Wednesday evening enthusiasts, and finally the choir contributed several items, the quality of their singing showing the great progress that had been achieved. About five o' clock visitors began to drift away, and this was the end of a most successful afternoon during which we hope that we had gained friends for our old people, and for ourselves renewed faith in the value of the work being done, and courage to continue. Christmas Party On December 16th a party was organised for our housebound old people. Transport was arranged by the London County Council Welfare Department and by voluntary drivers from Southwark Rotary. After an enjoyable tea came an entertainment given by the East Wittering women's Institute, who had come up to London, as they did last year, especially for this purpose. We do thank them for their real help. Library The mobile library continues to function at St. Alban's Hall on Fridays in the restaurant. Our grateful thanks are once more due to Mr. Boone, the Borough Council Librarian, and his staff, for thus offering the old people the opportunity of choosing reading matter to while away their long hours of leisure without the tiring effort of walking to the library. The library service to the homebound also still functions and meets a great need. Comforts Fund The generous donations of our friends have again helped us to supply many articles needed by the old people. This fund provides gifts of flowers, sweets and fruit for those in hospital, as well as invalid foods, blankets and clothing for the needy in their homes. In addition, we have been able to pay for convalescent holidays for several special cases. - 63 - We appreciate the generosity of these donors and their continued support. May we appeal to others who are interested in the welfare of the elderly who would care to send us contributions to this side of our work. Flag Day The annual Flag Day was held on Tuesday, September 2nd, and raised Â£131 15s. 7d. We have an enthusiastic band of collectors who never fail us, but we always need more to make this effort a real success. Fund Raising A new venture last year was the inauguration of a Fund Raising Committee for the specific purpose of raising money to purchase and equip a holiday home for old Southwark residents. The need for accommodation to take old people who could not be fitted into the pattern of the subsidised holiday scheme has been felt for a long time and has caused the Committee growing concern. Often an application has been made for a holiday by an old couple and after investigation it has been found that one or other of the partners is handicapped or too infirm to be taken on the organised holiday. Because of this, two old people have been deprived of their badly needed holiday. This Committee is under the able chairmanship of Mr. Montague with Mr. Maybank as secretary. Freddy Mills has consented to become the president, and the patrons include such names as Lord Amulree, M.D., F.R.C.P., Lord Luke, T. D., D.L., the Right Reverend Arthur Mervyn Stockwood, D. D., and the Right Reverend Cyril Conrad Cowderoy. We wish them every success in this worthwhile venture.
