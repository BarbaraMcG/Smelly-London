Mrs. Cave and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report on the health of the Borough of Hornsey for 1928. The only regrettable portion of the vital statistics for the year is the increase in the number of deaths of infants under the age of twelve months. It is not likely that this high rate of infant mortality will be maintained in subsequent years. As I have unfortunately been out of England during the time when this Report would normally have been prepared, I have done little more than give the necessary statistical information for the year under review. It only remains for me to give final expression to the gratitude I feel towards Dr. Prior, Dr. Muir, Mr. Thorpe, Mr. Gilroy and the other members of the staff of the department for their loyal assistance during the period I was privileged to be your Medical Officer of Health. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, WILSON JAMESON. 4 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS FOR 1928. Area 2,874 acres. Population (census 1921) 87,691 Estimated population (middle of 1928) 90,250 Number of inhabited houses (census 1921) 17,333 Number of private families (census 1921) 23,353 Rateable value £749,250 Product of a penny rate £3,122 Births— Legitimate Males 586 „ Females 560 Illegitimate Males 22 ,, Females 23 Total 1,191 Birth-rate, 12.1 per 1,000 population. Deaths— Male 474 Female 521 Total 995 Death-rate, 11.2 per 1.000 population. Deaths of infants under 1 year— Legitimate:—Males 34, females 81, total 05 Illegitimate:— ,, 3, ,, 5, ,, 8 73 Infant death-rate per 1,000 births— Legitimate 56.7, Illegitimate 177.7 Total 61.3 Death-rate from tuberculosis (all forms) per 1,000 living 0.76 Death-rate from zymotic disease per 1,000 living 0.17 POPULATION, BIRTHS AND DEATHS. Population. — The estimated population at the middle of 1928 was 92,250. The Registrar-General's estimate was 87,280— a decrease of 411 on the Census figure of 1921. Births Registered.—Eleven hundred and ninety-one babies were born in Hornsey, the birth-rate being 12.1 per 1,000 population—a considerable decrease on the figure (13.3) for the previous year. Forty-five of the births were illegitimate, the number being 48 last year. 5 Stillbirths.—Thirty-three stillbirths were registered, as required by the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1926, which came into force on the 1st J uly, 1927. The excessi of births over deaths for the year was 196. Births notified.—Eleven hundred and seventy-eight births (including 245 transferred from other districts and 129 transferred to other districts) were notified to the Medical Officer of Health under the Notification of Births Acts. These figures include 38 stillbirths, of which 10 were transferred from other districts and 4 were transferred to other districts. One hundred and thirty un-notified births were extracted from the Registrar's returns. Deaths.—The total number of deaths during 1928 was 995 —the death-rate being 11.2 per 1,000 population, the same as for 1927. Causes of death.—The most frequent causes of death, set out as percentages of the total deaths, were as follows:— Heart disease 18.5 per cent. Cancer 13.3 „ „ Cerebral hæmorrhage and arterio-sclerosis 12.9 „ „ Pneumonia and bronchitis 11.3 „ „ Tuberculosis 6.9 ,, ,, Table B. on page 31 shows the number of deaths due to various causes during the past eight years. Deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis show a slight increase, and those from bronchitis a small decrease. The most striking difference is in deaths from influenza, which number only 15, as against 54 in 1927. Infant mortality rate.—There were 73 deaths of infants under one year of age, including 8 of illegitimate infants, in 1928. This is equal to an infant mortality rate of 61.3 per 1,000 births, the highest rate since 1919. The infant mortality rate of illegitimate children was 177.7. The infant mortality rate for England and Wales was 65. Out-relief.—During 1928 the Guardians distributed the following sums in out-relief:— Ordinary 574 £12,854 Unemployed 452 4,125 1,026 £16,979 6 Fourteen more persons received relief than in 1927, but the expenditure was nearly £3,200 less. There was a slight increase in each class of case. SUMMARY OF NURSING, HOSPITAL AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS AVAILABLE IN THE DISTRICT, Nursing.—The Hornsey Nursing Association, which has been in existence since 1st July, 1927, now covers the whole of the Borough, in addition to a small part of Tottenham near Green Lanes and a small part of St. Pancras at the top of Highgate Hill. In return for a grant of 25 guineas a year the Association undertakes to nurse cases of measles and whooping cough, and in return for an annual grant of £5 by the Education Committee to visit when necessary children who have been operated on for enlarged tonsils and adenoids. I am indebted to Mr. R. H. Crookall, the Hon. Secretary, for the following account of the Association's activities during the year 1928:— The work of the Association has made steady progress during the year and there are now one Superintendent and four nurses on the permanent staff, with an additional nurse engaged temporarily from October. A total of 673 oases have been dealt with and 12,017 visits paid. These figures include 134 referred cases of children of school age, followed up after operation for enlarged tonsils and adenoids, to whom 151 visits were paid under grants from the Council. Seventy-two per cent, of the visits were paid to members and donors' domestic staff, 6 per cent. free of charge to poor persons and 21 per cent. to non-members paying fees. Amongst the cases dealt with have been the following:— Complications. Measles 7 (3 of these had Pneumonia) Pneumonia 25 (1 pleurisy, 1 whooping cough) (excluding the above 3) Pleurisy 11 (1 influenza) Broncho-Pneumonia 3 Influenza 7 Acute Rheumatism 4 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 3 (1 month and under) 7 Cancer 21 Hemiplegia 25 Tracheotomy (Cancer) 1 Cardiac 20 (It is interesting to note that the number of patients over 70 years of age was 128, or nearly 20 per cent. of the total cases nursed.) Membership and Finance. — The subscribing donors and members numbered 3,049 on the 31st March, the end of the Association's financial year. Three hundred and one subscribers have been added since that date, but through removals, deaths and non-renewal of subscriptions, the membership on the 31st December stands at 2,958. The financial position of the Association is nevertheless satisfactory; the increase in non-members' fees is more than double the amount of the decrease of £58 in membership subscriptions. The total receipts for the year amount to £1,414 15s. 5d. The expenses of the Association are assured to the 31st March next on the income for its financial year. The reserve of £484 at the end of March, 1928, will be available again to finance the Association until the bulk of subscriptions become renewable in July, 1929." The Hornsey Deanery Association for Preventive and Rescue Work at 109, Upper Tollington Park, receives unmarried mothers and their babies. A grant of £50 was made by the Council during the year, and the Association also receives a grant from the Ministry of Health. The Institute has accommodation for five unmarried mothers and their children, and for five expectant mothers. Babies are usually kept until four months old. The housework is done by the expectant and nursing mothers. The women are confined as a rule in Queen Charlotte's, the City of London or the Royal Free Hospital, while a few are sent to the North Middlesex Hospital. During the year a branch establishment has been opened at 79, Crouch End Hill, with accommodation for 12 nursing or expectant mothers and for "toddlers" as well as for babies. Hospitals.—The North Middlesex Hospital (Edmonton House) has increased its accommodation during the year by 50 beds and can now take 1,000 in-patients. The number of Hornsey cases admitted during the year was 832, viz., 146 maternity cases and 686 other cases. Twenty-eight of the maternity cases were mothers attending the Council's Welfare Centres. 8 The Hornsey Central Hospital, with 48 beds, dealt with 928 cases, of which 832 belonged to Hornsey. In the Out-Patient Department 1,058 patients made 5,902 attendances. The Council in March, 1928, increased its annual contribution to the Hornsey Central Hospital from £50 to £100. Midwives.—In addition to the Municipal Midwife, who is controlled and paid by the Council, there are 18 Midwives notified to the County Council as practising in the Borough. The County Council is the Local Supervising Authority under the Midwives Acts. Lying-in homes.—There are 211 lying-in homes registered with the Middlesex County Council under the Nursing Home Registration Act, 1927:— Clinic and Treatment Centres.— Maternity and Child Welfare Centres.

Twenty-eight cases were admitted to Hospital under these arrangements during the year. Infections Disease.—Cases of infectious disease are sent to the Isolation Hospital, Coppett's Road, Muswell Hill, N.10, which is controlled by a Joint Hospital Committee for the districts of Hornsey, Finchley and Wood Green. Small-pox.—The County Council of Middlesex have undertaken the responsibility of the isolation and treatment of small-pox for the whole of the County, and have entered into an arrangement with the Metropolitan Asylums Board for the reception of patients into their hospitals, at an annual cost of £5,000, to merge in the actual cost of patients treated during the year. The arrangement for treatment of Hornsey cases of small-pox in the Uxbridge Joint Small-pox Hospital at Yeading, Middlesex, has therefore been determined. Fortunately no case occurred in Hornsey during 1928. 10 Tuberculosis.—There are 756 beds available under the Middlesex County Council scheme for the treatment of tuberculosis in sanatoria allotted as follows : — Observation. Pulmonary tuberculosis. N onpulmonary tuberculosis. Total. "Sanatorium" Beds. "Hospital" Beds. Disease of Bones & Joints. Other conditions.

Petroleum (Consolidation) Act, 1928.—This Act, which came into force on the 4th August, brings within the compass of a single statute all the existing provisions dealing with the subject of petroleum spirit, and deals with the control of erection of pumps and filling-stations to prevent disfigurement of rural scenery. 14 Rag Flock Act. — Eighteen visits have been made to upholsterers' premises where rag flock is used. Shops (Hours of Closing) Act, 1928.—This Act makes permanent the general closing of shops (with certain exceptions) not later than 8 p.m., except on the late day (Saturday), when the hour of closing is 9 p.m. The Act now applies to the sale of tobacco, the sale of newspapers in shops (but not in the streets), and the sale of soft fruit and fresh fish. The closing hours for the sale of table waters, sweets or other sugar confectionery and ice cream, are fixed at 10 p.m. on the late day and 9.30 p.m. on other days. The sale of tobacco, sweets or other sugar confectionery and ice cream is permitted in places of entertainment at any time during a performance so long as the sale is to a bona-fide member of the audience. Regular inspections have been made in regard to the closing of shops at the hours set out in the Shops (Hours of Closing) Act. Generally speaking this Act is well observed, but where an infringement has occurred the attention of the shopkeeper has been called to the matter and an undertaking obtained that the contravention will not recur, in all oases with satisfactory results. Shops Act, 1912.—Close attention is paid to the provisions of the Shops Act, 1912, and to the closing of shops for the weekly half-holiday. Apart from neglect to display the prescribed forms in a few instances, all of which have received attention on notice being given to the shopkeeper, the Act has generally been well observed. Eight hundred and thirty-two inspections were made under this Act. There are 1,223 shops in the Borough which are the subject of inspection under the several Shops Acts. This is in addition to premises coming under the Factories and Workshops Acts. Cinemas.—Cinemas and places of public entertainment have been visited on 40 occasions, attention being directed to the sanitary conveniences and the general cleanliness of the premises. It is pleasing to report that in no instance have the conditions been found other than satisfactory. 15 Factory and Workshop Acts.—'The total number of Factories, Workshops and Work-places on the register is 412. At nine of these Factories more than 40 persons are employed. The businesses carried on at the respective premises are as follows:— Bakehouses 22 Dressmakers and milliners 61 Bootmakers and boot repairers 51 Tailors 26 Laundries 11 Motor and cycle engineers 43 Restaurant kitchens and manufacture of cooked meats 32 Printing 14 Upholstery 12 Builders 11 Pianos 11 Cleaning and Dyeing 10 Scientific Instruments 8 Plumbers 6 Watch and clock making 5 Picture framing 5 Furriers 4 Miscellaneous 80 412 Offensive Trades.—In February Last the Council made an Order, confirmed by the Minister of Health, declaring the trades of Rag and Bone Dealer and Fish Frier to be Offensive Trades in the Borough.

These houses are owned by a great many different landlords, most of whom spend a considerable amount of money on their property. There is some overcrowding, sub-letting is extremely common, and certain of the tenants are of a careless and an irresponsible type. Section B. is a block of property owned and managed very largely by the Borough Council and by the Metropolitan House Investment Company. The tenants have been to a large extent selected, most families live in self-contained dwellings, and there is very little overcrowding. I am indebted to Mr. Parry, the Relieving Officer, for the following particulars of the number of families relieved during 1928, and of the number of persons removed to the North Middlesex Hospital from the various streets in the two sections:— Section A. Families receiving Poor Law relief. Persons admitted to North Middlesex Hospital. Campsbourne Road 73 36 Myddelton Road 51 23 Boy ton Road 36 20 Pembroke Road 7 1 Brook Road 35 10 Eastfield Road 6 — Newlands Road 6 — 214 90 Section B. Nightingale Lane 6 4 North View Road 13 7 South View Road 2 5 Hawthorn Road 2 4 Beech wood Road 7 1 30 21 18 Re-houslng.—During the past year 28 families, representing 123 persons, have been re-housed, as follows:— From— Families. Persons. Campsbourne Road 1 6 Boyton Road 2 11 Pembroke Road 1 4 St. Mary's Road 1 6 liathcoole Gardens 1 5 Turnpike Lane 1 5 Archway Road 12 North Hill 8 Woodstock Road 1 7 Ward's Cottages 1 2 Grove House Road 11 Enfield Road 1 5 Nightingale Lane 1 3 North Hill Avenue 1 4 Coleraine Road 1 2 Allison Road I 5 Hampden Road 1 4 Duckett Road 1 2 Tottenham Lane 1 6 Prince's Parade 1 4 Nelson Road 1 4 Clarendon Road 1 7 28 123 In order to prevent a recurrence of overcrowding, the Sanitary Inspectors pay special visits to all houses about to be vacated by tenants who have been allocated dwellings on one or other of the Council's Estates. BOROUGH HOUSING SCHEME. The following is a summary of the Council's housing schemes, the dates of the first lettings being given in each case. Detailed particulars of accommodation were set out in the Report for 1927:— 19 Hornsey, 1st Scheme. (June, 1896.) 108 Highgate, 1st Scheme (December, 1900.) 60 Hornsey, 2nd Scheme. (February, 1904.) 140 Highgate, 2nd Scheme. (January, 1913.) 128 Muswell Hill Estate. (December, 1924, to November, 1927.) 427 Rectory Gardens Estate. (July, 1927.) 32 Total 895. There are also three houses, Nos. 38, 40, 42, Myddelton Road, owned by the Council, which are let out to several families. The inclusive rents of the various dwellings range from 11/6 to 22/- per week. Newlands Road Estate.—Arrangements are being made for the erection of 33 flats on land in Newlands Road. These flats will probably be ready for occupation during the coming year. During 1928 there were 86 houses and 17 flats erected by private enterprise, and 21 houses were converted into flats. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD. Milk.—The following are the registration and licensing figures for 1928:— Premises registered as dairies 62 Premises licensed for sale of "Pasteurized Millk" 18 Premises licensed to sell "Certified Milk" 14 Premises licensed to sell "Grade A (tuberculin tested) Milk" 4 Premises licensed to sell "Grade A Milk" (2 of which are for bottling and sale) 3 Thirty-six samples of milk from roundsmen have been taken by the Chief Inspector and submitted to bacteriological examination. Where the results were not satisfactory the milk vendor was interviewed, and in every case methods were suggested and agreed to for the better handling of the milk. Milk and Dairies Orders, 1926.—In two instances milk roundsmen were found to be contravening the provisions of the Milk and Dairies Order by filling milk bottles in the street. In one case the man attended before the Committee and was reprimanded, and in the second case a summons was issued and the man was fined £1. — 20 — Meat.— under the Public health (Meat) regulations, 1924, notice of intention to slaughter has to be sent to the Town Hall by all butchers who have slaughter-houses in Hornsey. In this way the Inspectors are enabled to inspect the carcase and organs of every animal killed in the Borough. The general standard of meat sold in Hornsey is good. During the year the carcases of 1,526 sheep, of 58 beasts, of 2 pigs rand of 1 calf were inspected under the Regulations, and 547 lbs. of meat and meat offal were surrendered voluntarily on account of some diseased condition. All diseased meat and offal are destroyed in the Corporation incinerator. Slaughter-houses.—The following is a statement regarding the slaughter-houses in the Borough: — In Dec., 1927. In Dec., 1928. Licensed 5 5 Other foods.—Particular attention was given to all premises where food is prepared or sold. During the year 854 visits of inspection were paid to the various food premises in the Borough. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.—Mr. Robinson, Chief Officer of the Public Control Department of the Middlesex County Council, has verv kindly sent me the following list of samples purchasec in Hornsey during the year ended 31st December, 1928: — Article. Taken. Adulterated Milk 204 11 Cream 7 1 Meat 16 3 Meat, cooked 3 0 Beef, minced 4 1 Bacon 4 0 Sausages 22 3 Cake 5 0 Sponge cakes 4 0 Cream pastry 8 0 Jam 2 0 Arrowroot 3 0 Semolina 4 0 Mustard 2 0 Pepper 1 0 Ginger 3 0 292 19 — 21 — Prosecutions 1 Convictions 1 INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Scarlet fever and diphtheria.—Scarlet fever sliowed a much higher incidence in 1928 than in 1927—the number of notifications being 328 as compared with 179. One hundred and four notifications of diphtheria were received (92 in 1927). Seventythree per cent, of the cases of scarlet fever and ninety-seven percent. of the cases of diphtheria were removed to hospital. The former disease caused two deaths and the latter six. Scarlet fever still continues to be of a mild type, and the policy of removing to hospital large numbers of the sufferers is of doubtful public health value; many cases could quite well be nursed at home and more accommodation in hospital would thus become available for severe cases of measles and of whooping cough. The following table shows the incidence of infecting cases discharged from the Isolation Hospital since 1921: — YEAR. SCARLF.T FEVER. Persons Infected "Return Cases' Infecting Cases.

Return cases mean cases occurring in the same house or elsewhere and apparently traceable to the person released, within a period of not less than twenty-four hours or not more than twenty-eight days after his return or release from isolation. The Medical Officer of Health visits all households where "return" cases of scarlet fever or of diphtheria have occurred, — 22 — and the infecting cases are carefully examined for some evidence of continuing infection. Schick testing.—A small commencement has been made with the .Schick testing and subsequent immunization against diphtheria of children brought to the various Maternity and Child Welfare Centres. Tuberculosis.—The following statement shows the condition of the register at the beginning and at the end of the year: — No. of cases at commencement of 1928. No. of cases added to register during 1928. No. of cases removed from register during 1928. No. of cases on register at end of 1928. Pul. Non.-Pul. Pul. Non. Pul. Pul. Non.-Pul. Pul. Non.-Pul.

The cases were removed from the register for the following reasons:— Deaths 59 Removed from district 27 Cured or disease arrested 18 Found by Tuberculosis Officer not to be T.B 1 Notification withdrawn 1 106 I am indebted to Dr. Dobson, the Middlesex Tuberculosis Officer, for the following details regarding Hornsey cases of Tubereulosis:- Total number of new Hornsey cases examined at the Local Tuberculosis Dispensary during 1928 Insured Non Insured.

Total number under supervision or observation on 31/12/28 116 96 212 — 23 — The average number of beds in residential institutions available for Middlesex patients suffering from tuberculosis during 1928 was 756, details of which will be found on page 10. The number of deaths from tuberculosis in Hornsey was 69 in 1928—the death-rate being 0.76 per 1.000. The rate in 1927 was 0.7. The number of notifications of pulmonary tuberculosis during the year was 93, and of other forms of tuberculosis 26. A detailed list of new cases of, and deaths from, tuberculosis will be found in Table G. (page 36). Influenza and pneumonia.—Influenza showed a marked decrease during the year, 15 deaths being attributed to this cause, as compared with 54 in 1927. The number of notifications of pneumonia was 94 and the number of deaths 60. The medical practitioners were again supplied at cost price with anti-catarrhal vaccine at the beginning of the winter, and the demand was greater than in previous years. Other infectious diseases.—Four cases of typhoid fever were notified, with 1 death. One case of poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis) was notified, and resulted in death. One case of encephalitis lethargica was notified, but 3 deaths were recorded. There were 6 deaths from measles and 1 from whooping cough. Three children under two years died of diarrhoea during the year. No case of small-pox occurred in the Borough. Ophthalmia neonatorum.—Six cases of ophthalmia neonatorum were notified during the year. All these cases were visited by the Health Visitors, and treatment was carried out by them or the District Nurses where necessary. An arrangement exists with the Metropolitan Asylums Board for the admission of cases of this disease to St. Margaret's Hospital, Kentish Town, and three of the cases mentioned were admitted. Cases. Notified. Treated At home In hospital. Vision unimpaired. Vision impaired. Total blindness. Deaths. 6 5 0 6 0 0 0 — 24 — Cleansing and disinfection.—Verminous persons and persons suffering from scabies may be cleansed at the Cleansing Station, High Street, Hornsey. A well-equipped station is provided, and during 1928 four adults and 90 school children (including 3 from Wood Green Schools) received treatment. This figure points to an improvement in this direction, the number requiring cleansing last year being 129. The clothing of such persons is disinfected at the time of cleansing, and in many cases it is found possible to disinfect the homes as well. Disinfection is offered in cases of death from tuberculosis, cancer, pneumonia and other diseases. In 89 of the 181 instances in which the service was offered it was accepted. The following is a record of the disinfection work carried out during the year: — Premises. Rooms disinfected. Articles disinfected. Articles destroyed. Notifiable diseases 436 502 7,196 1 Non-notifiable diseases 310 276 2,301 190 Total 746 778 9,497 191 Baths and washhouses.—In June the Council decided to provide in the West Hornsey area an establishment of this nature, at a cost of about £5,000 exclusive of site. Laboratory work.—With the exception of the more complicated blood tests all the routine bacteriological work is carried out at the laboratory of the Joint Isolation Hospital. The following district work was done during 1928: — Positive. Negative. Total Examinations for diphtheria bacilli 50 787 837 ,, ,, tubercle bacilli 23 192 215 ,, ,, typhoid bacilli 1 5 6 Other examinations 16 21 37 90 1,005 1,095 — 25 — MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE. "The infant mortality rate for 1928 was 61.3, an unwelcome increase on the low figure of 1927. The figures for England and Wales, for London and for the 107 Great Towns were respectively 65,67 and 70. Of the 73 infant deaths, details of which will be found in Table C. on page 32, 44 were of infants under the age of four weeks, and of these neo-natal deaths, as they are called, 26 were attributable to premature birth. This has for some years been the chief cause of death among infants in Hornsey and, so far as is known at present, the only means of prevention is for the expectant mother to receive adequate medical supervision during her period of pregnancy. The lack of care in the case of Illegitimate infants is shown by their appalling mortality—of 45 illegitimate infants born in Hornsey during 1928 no fewer than 8 died before reaching the age of one year. Three mothers died as a result of their confinements—two from sepsis and one from other causes. The maternal mortality rate was thus 2.52 per 1,000 births. Two of these deaths occurred in institutions, and none of the women attended the ante-natal consultations. The arrangement made by the Town Council for the provision of the services of consultants in cases of puerperal fever and puerperal pyrexia has proved helpful to medical practitioners during the past year. Three notifications of puerperal fever and 22 of puerperal pyrexia were received and a consultant was called in on four occasions. In no instance was it found necessary to make special bacteriological examinations or to provide a visiting nurse. Thirteen of the cases were treated in hospital and five in nursing homes. Midwifery.—Miss Andrews, the Municipal Midwife, attended 130 confinements during 1928—an increase of 8 on the figure for the preceding year. She was present at 64 ante-natal clinics during the year, and made 2,280 visits to the homes of the mothers. Since the municipal midwife was first appointed in 1922 she has attended 690 confinements. During the year a sum of £196 17s. was received from women attended by Miss Andrews, notwithstanding that a reduction of fee was made in 40 cases. — 28 — Twenty-eight women from Hornsey were admitted to the maternity wards of the North Middlesex Hospital, at a total cost of £150. Towards this sum the mothers themselves contributed £97 0s. 6d. During the year 815 babies were brought to the centres for the first time, and 1,717 babies made 13,933 attendances at the centres. At the ante-natal consultations 326 expectant mothers were seen for the first time and 706 attended as 'old cases.' Details of the work done in connection with maternity and child welfare work will be found in Table H., page 37. The Voluntary Workers attached to each centre have again rendered every possible assistance. They have raised considerable sums of money, which have been spent mainly on the provision of massage, convalescent home treatment and dental treatment. The number of cases assisted are as follows:— Massage 23 Dental treatment 42 Sent to Convalescent Homes 26 Holidays 8 The Fathers' Committee at Brook Road Centre have again subscribed liberally to the voluntary funds. Supply of milk.—During the year 144 cases have received milk free or at less than cost price. The sum so expended amounted to £48 17s. 8d. In another 17 instances the application for milk was not granted. Dental clinic.—In January last the Council adopted a scheme for the establishment of a dental clinic for mothers and children attending the Welfare Centres. The scheme was formulated in co-operation with the Voluntary Committee at each Centre, the Council undertaking the provision of dentist, anæethetist, clinic nurse, materials and ambulance if necessary; the Voluntary Committee undertaking the provision of dentures, the charges to be:—Complete denture £3, partial denture £1 15s., and repairs at cost. Charges are made to the patient of 1s. per attendance for ordinary treatment and 2s. 6d. for treatment under an anaesthetic; children 6d..per — 27 — attendance. All fees are collected at the clinic. The following scale of income, defining the terms on which dentures are supplied, was approved by the Minister of Health. INCOME PER HEAD AFTER DEDUCTING RENT. No. in family. No charge. To pay 25% To pay 50% To pay 75% 1 13/- 15/- 17/- 20/- 2 10/6 12/6 14/- 18/- 3 8/6 10/6 12/- 16/- 4 7/6 8/6 10/6 14/- 5 7/- 8/- 9/6 12/- 6 6/6 7/- 8/6 10/- and upwards. The Clinic was started on 30th April and sessions have been held twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays. The scheme has proved a great success and a boon to mothers, so much so that it has been found necessary, owing to the number of mothers requiring attention, to discontinue the treatment of children. It was estimated that the annual cost would be £200, and I am pleased to record that this sum has not been exceeded. The following table is a record of the work at the Clinic for the eight months to 31st December:— Mothers Children Individual cases treated 93 40 Total attendances made 310 77 Teeth extracted 406 184 Gas cases 100 36 Inspections 53 2 Local injections 5 29 Fillings 33 10 Dentures provided 10 0 Awaiting dentures 15 0 Attended for dentures 48 0 Other treatments, scaling, gum treatment, etc. 71 0 Cases finished 32 27 — 28 — X-ray treatment of mothers.—An arrangement was made, with the approval of the Ministry of Health, for the X-ray examination of expectant mothers at University College Hospital at a fee of 12s. 6d. each. Five mothers have been so examined during the year. Middlesex Central Consultation Ante-natal Clinic.—The County Council of Middlesex have established an Ante-natal Clinic, which is attended by Dr. J. S. Fairbairn, Obstetric Physician at St. Thomas' Hospital, for cases of special difficulty, and have offered the Council the services of the clinic at a fixed charge of 15s. per attendance per patient. The offer was accepted by the Council, but no cases were referred to this clinic during the year. Staff.—Miss Ross, Health Visitor at Brook Road Centre, was transferred to Coldfnll School as School Nurse on the opening of the new school on 10th September, and Miss Gwenneth Lewis was appointed, as from 24th September, to fill the vacancy of Health Visitor at Brook Road Centre. DISEASES OF ANIMALS ACTS. The following is a summary of the work carried out by Mr. F. G. Buxton, M.R.C.V.S., the Veterinary Inspector, during the year:— Licences issued under Diseases of Animals Acts 3 Inspections under ditto (Pigs) 236 Horses 3 Swine Fever Order, 1908—Visits to 21 pigs in quarantine 9 Parasitic Mange Order—Reporting on horse suffering with parasitic mange 4 — 29 — LIST OF TABLES.

Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the report for 1928 on the health of the elementary school children in the Borough of Hornsey. I was unfortunately absent from this country at a time when the report should have been prepared. As a result merely a skeleton report is submitted for your information. I should like to take this opportunity of thanking Mr. Allen, Mr. Hatcher and the whole staff of the School Medical Service for their generous help and unfailing courtesy to me at all times. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, WILSON JAMESON. - 3 GENERAL. Co-operation between the various health services in an area is essential if a real measure of success is to be attained. During the year under review special efforts were again made to improve existing working arrangements and to link up as closely as possible the Maternity and Child Welfare Service with the School Medical Service. Thus 403 school children made some 4,227 attendances at the four "Welfare Centres " and received treatment for minor ailments either from the health visitors or from the school nurses. Considerable numbers of children under five years of age attended the school clinic for the treatment of defective teeth, squint and discharging ears, and the school dental clinic has been made available, after school hours, for the dental treatment of mothers and of children of pre-school age. A satisfactory system exists for the transfer of information from the Maternity and Child Welfare Service to the School Medical Service in the Public Elementary Schools and again from the latter to the Secondary School Medical Service. Arrangements for the medical inspection of secondary school pupils is, of course, under the control of the Middlesex County Council, but, by a process of delegation to the Local Higher Education Committee, the County Council have helped materially to co-ordinate local health services. The new school on the Coldfall site to accommodate 840 scholars was formally opened on the 12th December, 1928, by the Duchess of Atholl, although children had actually attended the school since 10th September, 1928. Premises are available at this school for the medical inspection of school children and the treatment of minor ailments, and for use as a Maternity and Child Welfare Centre. MEDICAL INSPECTION AND TREATMENT. Thirty-five per cent. of the children on the rolls of the various schools were inspected on a routine basis during 1928, while 1,938 special inspections were also made. These special inspections were conducted both by the medical practitioner, who has attended the school clinic on one afternoon a week, and by the School Medical Officer, who holds a weekly morning session. Of all children submitted to routine inspection 9.7 per cent. were 4 found to require treatment of one sort or another. Large numbers of children came to the Central Clinic for treatment and advice—thus 1,802 attended the dental clinic, 643 the minor ailments clinic and 612 the ophthalmic clinic. The total number of attendances amounted to over 12,000. (a)—Uncleanliness.—There has been a definite decline in the number of verminous school children detected at the various inspections. At routine medical inspection the percentage of children so affected was 2.1 per cent, as compared with 2.7 in 1927. The school nurses, who made some 30,000 examinations of children during the year, found 479 children unclean, whereas in 1927 the number was 549. There has been a continuous rise in the standard of cleanliness in all schools for some years past, and there is no reason why the efforts of the school nurses, to whom with the head teachers all credit for this improvement is due, should not result in the attainment of a still higher standard in the future. Fewer children were dealt with at the Cleansing Station—89 as compared with 123 in 1927—and in 20 instances the powers given in section 87 of the Education Act, 1921, were exercised. In no case was it necessary to take legal proceedings against parents. Personal cleanliness is the foundation of personal hygiene and a child who has been taught to be clean has been, given a fair start on the road to self-respect. (b) Minor Ailments.—These ailments, which consist mainly of impetigo and other skin conditions, cuts, bruises and such like, are treated daily at the Central Clinic, and at the three Maternity and Child Welfare Centres—6,432 attendances were made by children suffering from such conditions. (c)—Tonsils and adenoids.—One or other or both of these conditions existed in 11.9 per cent. of the children inspected. One hundred and forty-seven children received operative treatment at the Clinic, while 39 were similarly dealt with elsewhere. The parents of those children who attend the Clinic are given printed instructions as to the importance of suitable breathing exercises after removal of tonsils and adenoids, and arrangements are made for the district nurses and the school nurses to visit the cases for some days after the operation. 5 (d) Tuberculosis.—As in previous years all children showing suspicious signs of pulmonary tuberculosis were reported to the Tuberculosis Officer. In 1928 the number so reported was 19. Arrangements exist whereby delicate children, especially those coming from houses where cases of tuberculosis are known to live, may be sent for varying periods to open-air residential schools. (e) Skin disease.—Apart from impetigo, the only skin diseases of any significance discovered during the year were ringworm of the body (3 cases), ringworm of the scalp (1 case) and cabies (14 cases). All the cases of scabies received treatment at the Cleansing Station and the case of ringworm of the scalp was submitted to X-ray treatment. (f) External eye disease and defects of vision.—The principal external eye diseases dealt with were squint (45 cases), blepharitis—an inflammatory condition of the eye lids—(10 cases), and conjunctivitis (15 cases). An endeavour has been made to secure the attendance at the ophthalmic clinic of all children under five years of age found at the Maternity and Child Welfare Centres to be suffering from squint. This condition can be treated satisfactorily only if the sufferers receive adequate expert supervision at an early age. One hundred and thirty-one children, or 4.9 per cent. of those submitted to routine inspection, were found to have defective vision. The school oculist, who attends twice weekly at the Central Clinic, examined 612 children and discovered a total of 467 defects, of which 387 were errors of refraction. Glasses were prescribed in 318 cases. Fifty-four children received treatment otherwise than under the Local Education Authority's scheme. (g) Ear disease and hearing.—Eleven cases of deafness were referred for treatment and 6 for observation. Forty cases of ear discharge were found to require treatment, as compared with 20 in 1927. "In the Aural Clinic the number and severity of cases of chronic otorrhœa which come for treatment diminish, whereas the number of those which pome for treatment during the acute stage remains high. These latter are easily treated, the great majority recover quickly and do not enter the chronic stage. 6 it is now possible to pay more attention to children who complain of deafness due to "catarrh" and non-suppurative disease. It is becoming increasingly recogniscd that in the case of many adults who are deaf the onset of the trouble began in childhood, and that the chief hope of preventing deafness in adult life is to treat the conditions found in children.

R. Friel, Aurist. (h) Dental defects.—Dental inspection as carried out at school medical inspections is of little value, as slight degrees of dental decay can be detected only with the and of a cental mirror and a probe. Thus, whereas at medical inspection. only some 27 per cent. of the children appeared to suffer from dental defects, the school dentists referred for treatment 77 per cent. of all children examined by them. During 1928 ten dental sessions were held weekly—24 half days being devoted to inspection and 383 to treatment. The school dentists examined 4,337 children and referred 3,342 for treatment. Of those so referred 2,080, or 62 per cent., actually 7 received treatment. A general anæsthetip was administered on 1,652 occasions. The school dental service is popular in Hornsey and, as additional sessions were instituted in 1928, there is no doubt that in the near future every child attending the Hornsey elementary schools will be given the chance of having adequate dental treatment before reaching the age for leaving school. (i) Crippling defects.—There are 34 crippled children on the books of the elementary schools in the Borough. In 21 of these cases crippling is the result of infantile paralysis and in 4 of tuberculosis. During the year two children were admitted to residential institutions for cripples, and one is still in attendance at a day Cripple School. FOLLOWING UP. There are three school nurses whose duty it is to visit the schools and to call upon the parents whose children have been recommended some form of medical treatment. Without the advice and intelligent assistance of these nurses school medical inspection and treatment would lose much of their practical value. In 1928 the nurses paid 1,203 visits to various school departments and 1,624 visits to the homes of scholars. The third school nurse took up duty in September, 1928. She is attached to Coldfall School and her work lies mainly among the residents on the housing estate to the north of Muswell Hill. OPEN-AIR EDUCATION. The usual playground classes were held last year, but the inclement weather experienced naturally caused a good deal of interruption. Two school camps were again held, and 75 children from Campsbourne School and 20 from St. Michael's and Highgate Schools attended. Two school journeys were undertaken; 40 boys from Campsbourne School spent ten days at Hastings and 42 girls from North Harringay School spent two weeks in North Wales and Chester. Eighty-three children were sent for a fortnight or longer to holiday homes at Herne Bay and Bognor. The eight places reserved in the School of Recovery at Parkstone and the Ogilvie Home at Clacton have been utilised to the fullest extent, 38 children having been sent during the year to one or other institution for a minimum period of six weeks. 8 PHYSICAL TRAINING. A fall programme of physical training and of organised games has been carried through as in previous years. Organised games and school sports are held on fields at Redston Road, Rokesly Avenue, Newlands Road, Priory Road, Highgate Woods and Finsbury Park. Before long another playing field will be available on the Coldfall site. In addition, large numbers of games are played in the school playgrounds—out of the usual school hours —in the form of systematic inter-house and inter-class competitions. Instruction in swimming has been given in the school bath during the summer months, and 1,020 children made at least 50 per cent. of the possible attendances at the school bath during the swimming season. At the beginning of the season 300 were able to swim, and by the end of the season another 400 had been taught to swim. Mr. Gilbert, of North Harringay School, General Secretary of the Hornsey Schools' Sports Association, has been good enough to give the following short report on the work of the Associatio: "The competitions in tennis, netball, cricket, football, athletics and swimming have been continued, and in some cases extended, partly by the inclusion of new events, partly by the entry of new schools. In some of the sections the time available is now so fully occupied that participation in Inter-District competitions has been largely curtailed. The Association again desires to express its appreciation of the generous help it continues to receive from the Borough Council, the Education Committee, and the Council's officers. The new shelter at the Redston Road Ground. for instance, has removed all anxiety as to the vagaries of the weather, whilst the existence of the Borough Trophy, for all forms of sport combined, has added zest to all the competitions. The scholars do not approach their games in any trophyhunting spirit. They are encouraged to regard them as a source of training in sportsmanship and good fellowship. The players are keen and enthusiastic; they play their games fairly and honourably; they do their utmost to win their games, but thev are taught to regard their trophies not as ends in themselves, but as tangible evidence of the effort which has been made and of the success which has attended that effort. 9 The Association remains convinced that the organised sport produces excellent results, and definitely contributes to that training of body, mind and character which is the educational ideal of our times." CO-OPERATION WITH PARENTS AND OTHERS. Arrangements have been made for the distribution to parents of small booklets giving useful information, not only on educational matters, but also on questions relating to health. Certain information from the Board of Education's table of exclusion periods in infectious disease has also been included. Parents continue to be present at medical inspections in fairly good numbers, 77.5 per cent. of those invited having attended during 1928. The teaching staffs and attendance officers work in close harmony with the school medical service. At the weekly clinic held by the School Medical Officer the Chief Attendance Officer is always present and all cases likely to present difficulty in one way or another are there dealt with. The Care Committees have again done most excellent work. Assistance has been given to parents in the purchase of surgical appliances, clothing and boots and the provision of convalescent home treatment. Members of the committees visit the homes of children who are about to leave the special school for mentally defective children and keep in touch with these children after they leave school. It is hoped to extend this work in the near future to all children leaving any of the special schools to which Hornsey children are sent children are sent. The following table shows the number of cases which have been provided with milk, cod liver oil and spectacles through the agency of the Care Committees from July, 1927, to July, 1928: — Number of Children provided with District. Milk. Cod Liver Oil and Malt. Spectacles and Repairs. Campsbourne 71 51 18 Crouch End 51 95 35 Highgate 5 25 21 North Harringay 6 16 18 Total 133 187 92 10 Parents are required to contribute, as far as possible, towards the cost of the articles provided, but in 45 cases of extreme poverty the cost was borne either by the Care Committee or by the Education Authority. In the majority of cases the parents succeeded in their efforts to repay by weekly instalments the whole of the outlay incurred. BLIND, DEAF, DEFECTIVE AND EPILEPTIC CHILDREN. The numbers of such children vary very little from year to year. During 1928 there were 17 children attending the special classes for the partially blind in Wood Green, 8 the special school for deaf children in Tottenham, 24 the joint special school for mentally defective children, and one a special school for epileptics. The School Medical Officer examined 29 children reported to him as certifying officer under the Mental Deficiency Act, and of these 12 were admitted to the joint special school. . Seventeen of the scholars left this school during the year and all are now in remunerative employment. Five children were notified to the County Council as requiring supervision. Reference to table III. will show how all the various types of defective children in Hornsey are being dealt with. STAMMERERS. There are two classes for stammerers, a senior and junior, and each meets twice weekly under the care of Miss Bains. Twentythree children have attended during the year, and of these 7 were admitted for the first time and 12 were discharged. These children as a rule make excellent progress while attending the special classes. Under the skilled supervision of Miss Bains they lose much of their self-consciousness and regain a great deal of self control. The greatest difficulty is experienced in getting them to practise in school and elsewhere what they are taught in the special classes, and too many of the parents take but little interest in the routine to be followed by a child who is to rid himself of this distressing defect. Without the co-operation of parents really satisfactory results cannot be obtained. 11 LIST OF TABLES. TABLE I.— Number of children inspected. ,, II. (a).—Defects found on examination. ,, II.
