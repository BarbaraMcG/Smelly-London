Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in presenting to you my report for the year ending March 27th last. Much work has been done in Sanitary matters during the year, but it is difficult to overcome ignorance and prejudices, and induce people to believe that cleanliness, good drainage, and pure water, tend to lessen sickness. During the year 2,261 children were born alive and registered in this district. Of these 1,140 were males, and 1,121 females. The excess of Births over Deaths was 916. The Birth rate exceeded that of the previous year by 93. TABLE No. 1. Years 1870-1 1871-2 1872-3 1873-4 1874-5 1875-6 1876-7 1877-8 1878-9 1879-80 Deaths 1410 1444 1119 1256 1287 1393 1206 1283 1424 1345 Excess of Births 655 499 997 828 880 777 893 900 829 916 The Deaths registered during the same period were 1,345, giving a decrease of 79, and a death rate of 23—8. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1879—80. 11 Tho number of males was 675, and of females 670. The Deaths of males exceeded that of females by 5. The Deaths were 11 below the average of the last ten years. In the 26th and 27th weeks of 1879, the deaths were 14, the lowest number registered in any other week, but the highest number was in the 6th week of 1880, when the deaths reached 72, and exceeded the Births by 9.

This remarkable fatality of lung disease was probably owing to tho combined effect of cold and fog. The lowest temperature registered was in the second week of December, when the mean temperature was 31°.1; and the highest in the fourth week of July, when the mean temperature was 64°.0. The Death rate for this District was 23 in 1000 persons. The death rate for the three Sub-districts is shown in the accompanying Table. The I Kent Koad being the highest, this is contrary to what it has been in previous years. TABLE No. 3. SUB-DISTRICTS. POPULATION IN 1871. NUMBER OF DEATHS IN 1879-80.

This was greatly in consequence of Bronchitis, Pneumonia and Whooping Cough, produced as I have stated before, from the low temperature and damp. The death rate of the chief zymotic diseases is given as they occurred in each quarter during the last five years, and also in Table No. 6 as they occurred during the previous ten years TABLE No. 5. 1875—6 1876—7 1877—8 1878—9 1879—80 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter j First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Small-pox ... ... ... .••• ... ... 9 17 11 1 1 3 6 5 ... ... 1 ... ... ...

With reference to this disease, a letter was received from the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board in relation to the epidemic of Small-pox, and was ordered by the Vestry to be printed and circulated. The observations of these gentlemen confirm former opinions on the subject, and establish beyond doubt, the mitigating influence of successful primary vaccination, and of efficient revaccination. Scarlatina has again been prevalent, showing a higher death rate than has occurred during the last ten years. Whooping-cough maintains an average, although the highest rate was in the 6th week of this year. Measles has been slightly higher than that of last year, but Diarrhoea was much below the average, doubtless owing to a low temperature during the summer months. 14 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark.

Of those who died 771 were under five years, 105 from five to twenty, 446 from twenty to eighty, and 22 at eighty and over, and 1 at a hundred. 108 Inquests have been held. Your Inspector Mr. Edwards, has been vigilant with regard to Adulterations, and has been able to obtain convictions in many cases against dealers, for impure Milk, but I fear that the wholesale dealers are often the guilty parties. Dr. Frankland reports that the water has not been free from organic impurities and says that it is desirable that the wholesome water drawn from the deep wells should be substituted for that portion taken from polluted rivers. I could wish that the Companies would use other means of obtaining payment than by cutting off the supply, hence leaving houses often a fortnight and more without water, which cannot be conducive to health and cleanliness. The Slaughter and Cow houses have been regularly inspected. I must congratulate the Vestry on having completed the Mortuary, a most necessary work; and trust it will be the means of stopping the spread of infectious diseases by enabling us to remove bodies that have died from certain diseases, from overcrowded houses, and thus prevent sickness and death to the living.
