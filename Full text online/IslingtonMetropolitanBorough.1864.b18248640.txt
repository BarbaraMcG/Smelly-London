46 ISL 33 REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR JANUARY, 1864. The deaths registered during the four weeks ending January 30th amounted to 450. This number exceeds the corrected average (297) by 153. A similar excess, though not quite so great, occurred in the rest of London. Although the diseases of the zymotic class have had something to do with this excess, their influence has been trifling when compared with that of the severe frost which prevailed at the commencement of the month, and which resulted in the deaths of a very large proportion of our old people, as well as of persons whose vital powers, already reduced by disease, could bear no further reduction without giving way. Hence it is that on casting our eye down the column of diseases in Table I., we find every class, without exception, adding its quota, especially from the chronic maladies, towards making up the excess. Thus we find recorded the enormous number of 149 deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs, and 27 from diseases of the heart, 47 deaths from consumption, 19 from apoplexy and paralysis, 17 from abdominial diseases, mostly chronic, and 11 from cancer. Twenty-two persons are said to have died simply worn out with old age. Among the old people the female part of the population suffered the highest mortality. Out of the 154 persons over 60 years of age, who died during the month, no less than 111 were females; but our female population over 60 years of age is considerably in excess of that of London generally. Of the zymotic class of diseases, croup and hooping cough have alone been unusually fatal, and in both of these the respiratory organs are implicated, so as to place the sufferer under an unfavourable influence on the occurrence of extreme cold. Only 8 deaths from fever appear upon the Table, and of these 4 are said to have been cases of typhus. Still wc may congratulate ourselves on our comparative freedom from this disease No. LXXXII. since only 2 cases of typhus were received from any part of Islington into the Fever Hospital during the month. Three deaths from smallpox have occurred, one of an unvaccinated child in Gordon Court, which is never very long free from the disease, one in the Irish Courts, and the third near the Lower Road.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR FEBRUARY, 1864. No. LXXXIII. The monthly mortality has fallen from the high number of 450, registered in January, to 318; but, although this indicates an improvement in the public health, the deaths in February still exceed the corrected mean of 7 years by 38. The excess, however, is readily accounted for—diseases of the organs of respiration being its sole cause. The deaths from these maladies, exclusive, of course, of consumption, amounted to 95, the corrected mean being 63. Sixtythree of the 95 deaths were referred to bronchitis, and 24 to pneumonia. The deaths from diseases of the zymotic class have been less numerous than in any month since February last year. The deaths from scarlet fever and measles have dwindled down to 11 and 6 respectively. Small pox is represented by only 3 deaths, and but 4 cases of this disease have occurred in the practice of those officers and institutions which furnish me with returns. The only deaths from typhus were one of a nurse in the Fever Hospital, and one of an infant, 3 weeks old, who was born in the hospital, and who thus drew in the infection with its first breath. It is worthy of remark that two of the deaths from typhoid (enteric) fever occurred, the one in the St. James's Road and the other in Pembroke Street, both of which streets have been for a very long—too long a time in a filthy and miasmatic condition. Two deaths from fever also occurred in St. James's Road during 1863, and one in 1862. EDW ARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Offices, March 9 th, 1864. TABLE I.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR MARCH, 1864. No. LXXX1V. The mortality of the Parish has continued to be excessive during the five weeks of March, but not from any remarkable amount of zymotic disease. Atmospheric conditions appear still to have more to do with it than anything else. The total number of deaths registered was 406, which is 56 above our corrected average mortality for March in the seven previous years. Of these 93 were due to diseases of the organs of respiration, the corrected mean being 77; and 65 to diseases of the nervous system, the corrected mean being 37. Fifteen of the latter deaths were from apoplexy, which in former years has only occasioned from 1 to 6 deaths in March ; and 14 from paralysis, which in former years has only yielded from 3 to 8 deaths. Again, the diseases of the tubercular class occasioned 71 deaths (51 being consumption), the corrected mean being 54. There were 21 deaths from measles and 18 from scarlet fever. The latter number includes the death of a young surgeon, aged 22 years, whose life was sacrificed to his devotion to the sick poor, while fulfilling the duties of Assistant Resident Officer at the London Fever Hospital. A fearful outbreak of infectious fever (typhus) has occurred in Mildmay Avenue—some new houses lately erected on waste ground in the rear of Mildmay Street—all of which might have been prevented had the owner of the premises carried out what has been required of him by the sanitary authorities of the Parish. As long ago as November, 1862, the owner of four houses, now numbered 1,2,3 and 4, was complained against on account of the unhealthy state of these premises, and notice was 2 served upon him to make various amendments in the houses and common yard, and to abate overcrowding, which was discovered when I visited the place with the Inspector. At this time a circular was delivered to the owner specifying what it was our practice to regard as overcrowding. For a time overcrowding was abated and improvements were made, but not to my full satisfaction. In September, 18G3, and again in December, complaints were made and further improvements demanded, none of which were effectually or thoroughly carried out. On January 10, 1864, a woman, named Martha Roadknight, aged 68, residing at No. 3 (a double house, with rooms on each side of a central passage), and occupying the left-hand back room on the ground floor, was found to have typhus fever. The room was small and occupied by herself and a grown up daughter with her four children. This woman died. As soon as I heard of this occurrence I sent the Inspector, and, in consequence of his report, visited thess houses again myself. They were found to be greatly overcrowded, and notice for abatement, and for the completion of neglected improvements, and for ventilation, were served upon the owner in due course. On January 28th a second case occurred in a boy, aged 13 years, residing with his father (Wm. Waymouth), and his mother (Ann Kyser or Waymouth), in the left-hand ground floor front room, occupied altogether by six persons. One of these, Ann Kyser, aged 15 years, was attacked on February 12th; another, Augusta Kyser or "Waymouth (the mother), on March 8th; William Waymouth, aged 3 years, on the same day; William Waymouth (the father), aged 55, on March 17th, and Ferdinand Kyser, aged 10 years, on the same day—none in this room escaping. On March 19th, Mr. Keele heard, by accident, that there was fever upstairs, and there he found a whole family of 8 persons (Clarke), who occupied the room, ill with typhus; they varied in ages from 1½ years to 40 years of age. The room was the left hand side back room, above Roadknights. On the same day typhus was found on the ground floor front room on the right hand side of the house, in a boy named Fox, aged 9 years. On the 1st April another case was found, which had been ill a week, in the left hand front room on first floor, next Clarke's room; and on the 7th April another, in the room vacated by the Roadknights after the old woman's death, and re-occupied by a fresh family. In all, 20 cases of typhus are known to have arisen in this house, and others, as the Roadknights, left while believed by Mr. Keele 3 to be sickening for the disease. These have consequently carried typhus away to spread it elsewhere. The rooms occupied by these families were all, more or less, overcrowded—that occupied by the Clarices most of all—the cubic space per head not exceeding about 144 feet. The room was sickening to enter. As the owner, although promising to make all the requisite amendments, did not carry out his engagements, a summons was at last taken out against him at the Police Court, and, at the hearing, on March 23rd, lie agreed to an order for abatement, and for the closure of this and the other houses until made fit for human habitation. As I write now this order has not yet been complied with. This is monstrous. The fault lies in two circumstances—first, the imperfections of the Nuisances Removal Act, when applied to meet the actual outbreak of infectious disease ; and secondly, the immense amount of work now thrown upon the magistrate and officers at the Clerkenwell Policc Court, which, notwithstanding the efforts made to accommodate us by as early a hearing as possible, results in delays which are wearying to us, which involve great loss of time to our officers, and may, as in this instance seems to have been the case, give occasion to the spread of disease which might otherwise have been checked. Of the 9 deaths from fever during the month, one was from typhus ; it occurred in Elder Walk. I am informed that Mrs. Roadknight, mentioned above, had come into 3 Mildmay Avenue from some house near the Lower Road.

The mortality of the Parish has continued to be excessive. The deaths registered, excluding those of strangers in the Hospitals, amounted to 316. The mean number of deaths during April in the eight years previously is about 220, but, for comparison with the mortality of this month, it must be augmented by 4.½ as a correction necessitated by our increased population. Thus raised to 273, the mortality of the past month is found to exceed the mean of eight years by 43. The excess is partly due to measles and cases returned as " Fever," but principally to deaths from the so-called local diseases, especially diseases of the lungs. Since my last Eeport three fresh cases of typhus have occurred at 3, Mildmay Avenue, two of them being new occupants of a room vacated by a family that had had typhus. A girl from the house (one of the Clarks) went to sleep with a Mrs. Woodman, at 16, Dorsetstreet, and communicated fever to her, and this woman is now in the Fever Hospital. A woman named Fox, whose children had typhus, went on the 9th of April into the City-xoad Lying-in Hospital to be confined, carrying typhus with her, and there she died of the disease. An inquest was held by Mr. Humphreys, and a special verdict recorded throwing censure upon Mr. Wm. Smith, the owner of the house, who has also been fined at the Police-court for disobedience to the order of 2 the Magistrate for its closure. This inquest was shortly followed by another upon a man who, having removed from this house to Hoxton, drowned himself in the Regent's Canal during the delirium of fever: one of his children had suffered from typhus. At No. 4, Mildmay Avenue, two cases of malignant scarlet fever have occurred, and one has died. This house is also under orders for closure, as also another greatly over crowded house, No. 2. All three must, after closure, be thoroughly purified and disinfected before permitted to be re-occupied, or fever will revive. Ten cases of typhoid fever, out of which three died, have occurred in a family of thirteen persons, residing at No. 65, St. James'-road. This is a fever which takes its origin from altogether a different cause from typhus, being little infectious. In this instance one defect occasioned all the cases, namely, a broken trap in the water-closet within the house, which remained for a long time neglected, and occasioned a bad smell in it during the whole period. It is difficult to understand such carelessness when the penalty for it may be so severe, and the remedy of the defect is so easy and so cheap. Nothing but ignorance, or an absolute disbelief in the best established laws of health and disease can explain it. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. Yestry Offices, May 4th, 1864.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR MAY, 1864. No. LXXXVI. Two hundred and ninety-four deaths were registered in the four weeks ending May 28th. This exceeds the corrected mean mortality of the corresponding weeks in the last 8 years by 51; the excess, however, being still due to the deaths registered under the class denominated "local diseases." Diseases of the heart and lungs, with diseases of the nervous system, have contributed to the' excess in a more marked degree than any other maladies. Probably the remarkable weather we experienced during the month was the immediate cause of these events. During the first two weeks the temperature, which had been little above the average temperature of 43 years, suddenly rose in the third week to be nearly 9 degrees above the average, with a daily range in each 24 hours of from 22 to 33 degrees, and then, on the 21st of the month, suddenly fell, after a thunder storm of some severity, from the mean temperature of 65.2° to a mean temperature of 52.3°. During the fourth week the mean temperature was 2.6 degrees below the average of 43 years. The temperature in the shade has been as high as 81°, and as low as 35°. The cases of small pox on the Sickness Table have risen from 3 to 14. All of these were persons attended by the Parochial Surgeons. Five of them occurred at No. 3, Adelaide Square; a sixth case, which was fatal, occurred ia the adjoining house; the others in Gordon Court, 2 ton Place, Copenhagen Street and Payne Street. There were 5 deaths, also, from this disease which need not have occurred. Four of them were in persons who had not been vaccinated, and one in an adult, aged 44 years, who had neglected the precaution of re-vaccination. The six cases of fever at the Workhouse were all typhus. Four were tramps, the other two were the bathman and an attendant in the bath room. The duties of these people brought them in contact with the tramps. The latter of these died at the Fever Hospital. Four of the deaths recorded as from fever were deaths from " typhus."

The monthly mortality still continues above the average; but whereas it was 51 above the mean in May, it was only 25 above the mean in the month just closed. The deaths registered amounted to 310. Those from zymotic causes were only 68, whereas in June last year they numbered 109. The excess of mortality was not due then to any epidemic causes. In comparing the mortuary table with that for the corresponding weeks in former years, it appears that the total excess is accounted for by an unusual mortality from diseases of the nervous system, especially "convulsions" in infants, and paralysis in those advanced in years, while double the ordinary number of infants are said to have died from atrophy and constitutional debility. In addition there were 3 homicides, 3 suicides, and 5 deaths from drowning and other accidents. Of the 10 deaths from fevers, 5 are returned as from "typhus," one being that of a City Missionary. Four of the 6 cases of small-pox indicated in Table II. occurred in Adelaide Square. Finding the disease disposed to spread in this place, I suggested to the District Vaccinator the expediency of a house to house visitation with a view to offer vaccination to all he might find unprotected.

Two hundred and seventy-seven deaths of inhabitants of Islington were registered during the four weeks ending July 30th. The corrected mean mortality of the eight previous years during the corresponding period is 267, so that the present year exhibits 10 deaths in excess of the average. The deaths which have contributed most to the excess are those registered under the headings of "old age" on the one hand, and "atrophy and debility" in infants on the other. The latter of these terms is especially indefinite; at all events it is satisfactory that with the exception of diarrhoea, which always prevails more or less at this season of the year, the public health in this parish has been tolerably satisfactory. Of the seven deaths returned as from "fever," only one case appears to have been typhus, viz.: an engineer at the London Fever Hospital. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health.

MAM, ISLINGTON, FOR AUGUST, 1864. No. LXXXIX. The tables of mortality and sickness during the four weeks of August call for but few remarks. The number of deaths registered, namely, 260, approach within six of the corrected mean mortality of the previous eight years, namely, 254. The number of deaths from bowel complaints, diarrhœa and summer cholera, amounted to 52, all but four occurring among infants and young children. This number exceeds the corrected mean of eight years by eight deaths. They were chiefly registered during the first three weeks of the month. The two deaths from small-pox were both in unvaccinated persons, one of them being a child in Adelaide Square. I understand that the District Vaccinator met with but little success in inducing the parents of unvaccinated children in this place to bring their children to be vaccinated. Of the deaths from fever enly one is designated "typhus." The deaths of very young infants stated to be due to " atrophy," "inanition," "debility from birth," &c. were unusually numerous.

The registered mortality for the five weeks ending October 1st amounts to 320, which, although short of that in September last year, is still twenty-one above the corrected mean of eight years. The excess appears principally due to an unusual number of deaths from consumption and diseases of the chest. Of the nine deaths from fever registered, four are stated to have been caused by " typhus." Scarlet fever appears again to be on the increase, the deaths having risen from six in four weeks to fifteen in five weeks. The weekly mortality from it was 5, 4, 9, 3, 8. Of the three deaths from small-pox, one was of an unvaccinated child in Adelaide Square. This is the fourth death from small-pox in Adelaide Square during the last few months. I have before me the returns made by the Inspector of Bakehouses, who since his appointment has visited 192 bakehouses. He has furnished the particulars relating to each upon a form which I drew up for his direction. Tt may be as well that I should at once supply, for the information of the Veslry, an analysis which I have made of Mr. Godbold's returns. 1. Of the 192 Bakehouses, seventy-two or more than a third are stated to be dirty—some very dirty. In many more, not thus returned as generally unclean, the walls and ceilings are described as dirty or dilapidated. In one, besides an accumulation of rubbish, a horse was kept in the bakehouse. 2. In fifty-one the paving or flooring was broken or in bad condition. In one a defective drain ran beneath the bakehouse at the spot where the man stood to work at the trough, and the soil rose between the stones as they were stepped upon. In three the floor was undermined by rats—a pretty sure indication of foul effluvia. In one the walls were damp from leakage from a neighbouring drain. 3. Seven were without any means of ventilation whatever. In the rest the ventilation varied from excellent to very imperfect. 4. In three there was no proper sulphur flue. 5. In three a panned privy without proper water supply, or very dirty, was situated on the same level with the bakehouse, and near enough to introduce foul effluvia into it. In three other instances the privy was within the bakehouse itself; in one of these there was neither pan nor trap, the privy consisting of a bar of wood over an opening in the drain. 0. In two the storeroom was dirty; in one of these there was also a stench from a drain. 2 7. Twenty instances were discovered in which the bakehouse was used as a sleeping-place; the custom where this was found being to admit the men some hours before the time for commencing work, so as not to disturb the master for the purpose of letting them in. In one of these instances the air was liable to be especially foul by the absence of a sulphur flue, and in another by the privy being within the bakehouse. 8. In two instances the sleeping-place for the workmen was a few inches below the level of the bakehouse; in one of these the sleeping place was without any means of ventilation. 9. In five instances the men slept in the loft over the bakehouse and furnace—a very hot place. In one of these the man informed Mr. Godbold that the boards were so hot at times that he could scarcely stand upon them, and that the place in consequence of the heat was swarming with bugs. One of these sleeping lofts was the medium through which alone the hot air and steam from the bakehouse could escape. 10. In two instances sleeping rooms on a level with the bakehouse were not ventilated by windows, opening to the extent required by the statute. 11. Mr. Godbold, in his night visits, did not discover any youths under eighteen years of age (apparently) at work. 12. There are fifteen establishments where it is stated that the business is conducted without night work. As the Act appears to be designed very much for the benefit of the Bakers'workpeople, I may further add,—1. That there were in Islington at the census of 1861, 502 males over twenty years of age occupied as bakers and seventy-three as confectioners. 2. That during the three years, 1860-2, twenty-one bakers over twenty years of age died, which is a mortality of about forty-two per 1000 every three years. 3. That their mean age at death was fifty years, twelve dying under, and nine above that age. (The mean age at death of bakers generally as determined by Dr. Guy, is forty-two years ; weavers, whose business is certainly not conducive to longevity, have still, according to Dr. Guy, the advantage over bakers of living on an average nine years longer.) This mean age at death would give to our bakers, when twenty years of age, an expectation of life of thirty years, whereas the expectation of life of the male population of the country generally at that age is forty years, according to the " English Life Table." 4. That of these twenty-one bakers, twelve or more than half, died of consumption, or disease of the lungs; four of disease of the brain, or paralysis; three of inflammation or haimorrhage of the stomach and bowels; and one from diabetes, leaving one who died from the ordinary decay of nature. This liability to chest disease in bakers is also in correspondence with Dr. Guy's observations, who on questioning 100 bakers, found that eighty (thrice as many as among printers' compositors) were subject to chest diseases more or less severe.

In London, too, both the constitutional diseases and those of the developmental class were more fatal than last year, while in Islington they have been less fatal. The contrast between the mortality in October this year and that in October last year is thus so great that it becomes important to ascertain the cause of the difference, and probably we shall not be far wrong in seeking for it mainly in the difference of meteorological conditions observed during each October and the weeks immediately preceding. 1. The barometric pressure was higher than last year during the last week of September and the first half of October. 2. The month of September was warmer and the first two weeks of October were colder than last year. 3. The wind during September, and a great part of October, last year was S.W., and only occasionally during October S.E., always Southerly on one side or the other. This year the wind, which had been S.W. during the first four weeks of September, became variable in the last week of September and during October, when the wind was frequently E., N., N.E., and N.W. The air then was purer. 4. Very little rain fell during the month of October, none during the last week of September and the first two weeks of October. The atmospheric humidity was less during all October than last year. 5. Much less ozone was observed in the atmosphere during September and October than last year. This, for us, was ahealthy combination of circumstances. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Offices, October 8th, 1864. TABLE I.

The deaths for four weeks have again risen to nineteen above the corrected mean for November. But it is to be remarked with this fact, that the number of cases of sickness has not risen proportionately to the mortality, but has been smaller than in October. The deaths in four weeks have risen from 216 in October to 308, while the cases of sickness have fallen from 2370 to 2286. I should be disposed to infer from this, and also from the fact that the whole of the excess of mortality is foundunder the head of " local diseases," that the cold foggy weather at the commencement of the month, while it doubtless for the time increased our sickness, and especially the number of cases of chest disease, operated more in the way of hastening the death of weakly persons, chiefly of those who were the subjects of chronic disease. The mortality from zymotic diseases has been by no means unusually large. Judging from the table of sickness, however, small-pox appears to be on the increase. It is right that the public should be aware that the contagion still lurks amongst us, and that those who would be safe from its influence must look to the vaccination of their children, and, where necessary, to their own re-vaccination also. It is a good practical rule for all persons to renew their protection on arriving at adult age. The mortality from scarlet fever, though greater than in October, has not exceeded our usual November average. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Offices, December 2nd, 1864.

REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR, DECEMBER, 1864. No. XCIII. Our mortality and general sickness during the past 5 weeks have been comparatively low. The deaths registered amounted to 368, a number which is 38 below the corrected mean mortality of December during the preceding 8 years. In London at large, the mortality has each week been more or less in excess of the average. The principal mortality has been due to diseases of the heart and lungs, the zymotic diseases altogether producing only 66 deaths. During the five weeks of December, the zymotic mortality has ranged, during 7 years past, from 66 (in 1857) to 134 (in 1862). During the cold weather eight infants were suffocated accidentally in bed, A slight outbreak of measles has taken place at the Infant Poor Hou«e; and the only other part of the parish where measles has prevailed to any extent is the White Conduit District, and the streets adjoining the Caledonian Road. Eight cases of Typhus (infectious low fever) have occurred to my knowledge. Five have entered the Fever Hospital from a close dirty house in Crescent Avenue. The eldest daughter, Emma Clark, was the first attacked, having brought home the disease from No. 24, Caledonian Crescent, where she worked, with a number of other girls, at artificial flower making. At this house the two basement rooms are used as work-rooms. They measure respectively 1568 cubic feet and 883 cubic feet. In the first room 13 girls and a woman work, seated closely at a table, the cubic space allotted to each being thus only 112 cubic feet. In the other room, where Emma Clark was taken with the fever, there were 6 girls and women working—also closely seated at a table, the cubic space allotted to each being thus 145 cubic feet. The two rooms communicate by a doorway. It was in the smaller of the two rooms that the fever commenced. So far as I have been enabled at present to ascertain, the first case happened to a girl who came from a fever house in St. Pancras; from her it spread to the woman who sat next her at the table (a Mrs. Bonnick), then to the next girl (Ann Dorby), then to Emma Clark, who sat near Dorby. It did not enter into the adjoining room. Emma Clark took the disease home. She was ill at home for a week, sleeping in a diminutive room by herself, and attended on by her mother and sisters. She then went to the Fever Hospital. Shortly after her return, her two sisters, aged respectively 9 and 13 years, were taken ill and sent to the hospital. The mother was next taken ill, and went to the hospital on January 2nd, and now the father has gone with the same disease, every member of the family having suffered. Now, whatever limits expediency may place upon our requirements in the tenements of the poor, no consideration of expediency can hold good where, for his own profit, an employer collects a number of work-people together in a crowded room, so as to favour the spread of a disease so dangerous as Typhus Fever. In such a case as this the full demands of sanitary experience should be exacted, and these include something more than mere cubic capacity in the work room. As a preliminary step, notice to abate the overcrowding will be served upon the occupier of the house. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Offices, January 9th, 1865. TABLE I.

TO THE VESTRY OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON. Gentlemen, I am afraid that there are some very erroneous notions entertained as to the value of what is called "tho death-rate" as indicating the healthiness or unhealthiness of any place or district, both when people compare the death-rate of the same place at different times, and when they compare the death-rate of one place with that of another. And more especially do enquirers sometimes delude themselves, when they attribute differences of death-rate, as a necessary and invariable result, to corresponding differences in the degree to which some one class of morbid causes prevails, at whoso door they are pleased to lay the burthen of every ill that flesh is heir to; forgetting, or possibly never having known, that the causes of disease are manifold, and so complicated and interwoven in their operation, that the more they are studied, the more cautious does the student of them become, when distributing occurrences as effects among them, lest he should overstep the bounds of strict induction, or the limits of a reasonable probability. And first let me say that what Lord Bacon would have called an " Idol of the market," has something to do with the confused ideas which are not rarely entertained on this subject. I allude to the ambiguity of the terms " healthy" and "healthiness," as these words aro popularly employed. Thus, when wo say "tho parish is healthy," and when wo say "this is a healthy parish," I think it must be apparent that we commonly use the word " healthy" in two quite different senses. In the one phrase we use it to declare the absence of disease, in the other to declare the absence of certain local causes of disease. This double applicability of the term is unfortunate, since it forms a trap by means of which people are apt to fall into one of the most fatal of logical errors, namely, confounding an effect with its cause. I propose, then, in future, to employ a different word when referring to ths absenco or presence of local causes of disease, namely, the word " wholesome," limiting tho word " healthy" to those occasions when popular freedom from disease is]referred to. If there is at any time much sickness and a high mortality, no matter from what cause, the people must be said to be unhealthy ; but for all that, the place itself may be wholesome—that is, the unhealthiness may be due to other causes than local unwholesomeness. To enumerate some of these other causes. There may be much unhealthiness among a people, and a higher death-rate than usual; or a higher death-rate then is met with elsewhere, because there is an excess of persons at the extremes of life, either very young, or else of old persons, who are both more liable to disease, and whose diseases are more liable to be fatal, than persons in the intermediate periods of life; or the difference may depend upon a difference in the proportion of the sexes, and the occupations which males or females respectively follow at the different periods of their lives; or it may be connected with a difference in the stationary or shifting character of tho population, the amount of increase from 4 births 011 the one hand, or from immigration on the other ; the ages, habits, <fcc. of the immigrants, the state of health that they bring with them into a district, and the wliolesomeness or unwholesomeness of the places from which they have migrated. Again, both as respect differences in death-rate in the same place at different times, and between different places at the same time, much will depend upon the chance introduction of certain morbid contagici; or, if we regard theso seeds of disease as ever present among us, to the co-existence at one time and not at another of these meteorological or other conditions which favour their energetic operation upon the human system. Add to all this that unhealthiness is at any time promoted by lack of employment, by scarcity or dearness of food, or of some important or essential variety of food, such, for instance, as vegetables on the one hand, or meat on the other; and I think we shall have run over a sufficient number of possible circumstances, the influence of which must be eliminated before we fall back upon local causes of unwholesomeness, to explain the fact of a mere increase in an annual death-rate, or of the death-rate of one place being in excess of that of another. If we would argue from death-rates to relative local wliolesomeness or unwliolesomness, we must then compare similar things, and, if things that we wish to compare are not similar, then we must sub-divide each, until we find sections of each that are similar, and so comparable with a view to the sort of result desired. Sometimes this can be done satisfactorily, at other times it cannot, at least without a very dis-proportionate expenditure of labour; in the latter case we must content ourselves with making allowances for such conditions as are dis-similar. In this way if we fail in gleaning all the truth, we can at least avoid picking up the errors which over lie, and so fatally resemble it. So much then for "healthiness" as a term applied to a people. Wo should also have a clear idea of " wholesomeness" as a term applied to a place. The term " wholesome" implies the absence, more or less complete, of local causes of disease; their causes being principally the following:—An atmosphere tainted with such gaseous or vapourous matters as experience has demonstrated to effect the human frame injuriously; or having suspended in it and blown about by it such dust-like matters as are capable of developing disease when coming into contact with the skin or lungs; or when they chance to have fallen upon any food that is eaten. A position which lays the place open to suffer inordinately from climatic influences, such as cold in winter, heat and atmospheric stagnation in summer, dampness on the one hand, or draught and dustiness on the other. A supply of water for domestic use either contaminated with poisons such as lead; or with such matters of an organic nature, and perhaps even diseased origin, as when received into the human body disorder functions. Lastly, in our idea of local unwholesomness, we include a crowded and ill-ventilated condition of habitations, crowded by close packing together of the houses themselves, crowded by tho close packing of the rooms within each house, and crowded by close packing of inhabitants within each room. All other things being equal, the locality most wholesome, most free from these and similar local causes of disease, will be most free from disease, most healthy—and the converse is also true. But neither docs this law nor its converse always hold good when the other conditions are not equal. 5 It is with local wliolesomeness that we have principally to do, and the interest that attaches to variations in our rate of mortality depends upon the relation which, in accordance with this law, exists between popular unhealthiness and local un. wholesomeness. How important then is it that we should be iu some degree at least prepared to read aright, or at all avents, not to read incorrectly the indications of our mortuary table ! It is with this conviction that I preface this report, by the statement of certain facts relative to our population, and that of London at large, and to the changes which the last lustrum saw proceed in both, which may be gathered by a little trouble from the census table, but which, not appearing upon the face of them, might readily be over-looked. 1. As respects the proportion between the sexes, it appears that although we have still a large excess of females in our population, and although the proportion is higher than obtains generally in the metropolis, it is not so high as it used to be. (Table IV). 2. As respects the ages of our population, it appears that the preponderance of young people under 20 years, and still more remarkably of infants under five years of age has become greater than it was in 1851. The same thing is observable with London at large, but with us the increased proportion of young people is excessive. (Tables Y. and VI.) The importance of this fact lies in this, that the larger the proportion of infants in a population,the larger (other things being the same) may the general death-rate be expected to be, and especially the mortality from those contagious (zymotic) diseases to which children are particularly liable. 3. Our female population is largly increased by the influx from the provinces and extra metropolitan districts of young women between the ages of 15 and 20 years. This is shown by the fact of the number of young women living between these ages, being, to the extent of 193 per 1000, in excess of those living between 10 and 15 years of age (Table IX). The influx too between these ages seems to be a growing one, and it is between four and five times larger than takes place in the metropolis generally. We get the lion's share of these young female immigrants. What becomes of them 1 Clearly they do not settle here immediately by marriage, since of 8831 young women between 15 and 20, only 217 were married. Probably the greater number enter into domestic service, others become shopwomen, and some proceed to learn such businesses as those of dressmakers, milliners, artificial flower makers, &c. Probably too a good many are young girls at school. 4. Not only have we an excess of young people in Islington, but we have, as compared with the whole metropolis, a smaller proportion of old people. Of our entire population over 20 years of age, our elderly persons over 60 years form 848 per 10,000; in London at large such persons form 969 per 10,000. We have even fewer old people now proportionately to all adults than we had in 1851, when the numbe was 933 per 10,000. (Table XII.) This fact will naturally affect the mortality iu our parish from bronchitis, asthma, and other infirmities of old age. 6 5. As respects our population between the ages of 15 and 60 years—the labouring period of life—the number of females in our parish is proportionately to the males very much larger than in London at large. Between 15 and 20 years our females exceed every 1,000 males in number by 436; between 20 and 25 years they exceed every 1,000 males in number by 450; and then, as the quinquenniads of age succeed, the disproportion between the sexes gradually lessens. (Table VIII.) 6. Compared with London generally, the proportion of our population not bom in any part of the metropolis is larger both for the ages below and for those over 20 years. Under 20 years our excess of provincials and foreigners over the metropolis generally is only remarkable in the case of the females, but over 20 years it is observed in both sexes. More than half the adult population was not born in London. (Table VII.) 7. And the census tables read intelligently will inform us as to the ages at which the immigration mostly takes place. This may be gathered by a comparison between the numbers living at consecutive quinquenniads of age, for where the number in one quinquenniad exceeds that in the preceding quinquenniad, the inference of an immigration at that period of life is inevitable, for the tendency is towards diminution of numbers by mortality as age advances. I have made such a comparison, and the inference from it is that the principal influx of male provincials into Islington takes place between the ages of 20 and 25 years. The influx between these ages appears to be nearly four times as large as that into London generally. The influx of female provincials into Islington is altogether very much larger than of males, and takes place chiefly between the ages of 15 and 20 years: there are more males than females entering from outside between 20 and 25 years. There is this further to be remarked, that whereas, speaking in general terms, the influx of female provincials is much smaller in London at large than with ns between the ages of 15 and 25 years, there is also a further difference, namely, that the greater number come into London at the later and not at the earlier quinquenniad of age as with us. (Tables XI and XII.) I have already shown (Report for 1860) how variations in the amount of immigration from outside affect our death-rate. 8. The proportion of workers (bread and comfort earners) in our male population is much the same as in the metropolis generally, viz. 973 per 1000 over 20 years of age. I have no means of estimating those industrially occupied below this age. As to the females over 20 years of age in Islington (including 1037 who being wives of innkeepers, publicans, lodging-housekeepers, shoemakers, shopkeepers, butchers, and farmers, are held by the compilers of the census return to be engaged in their husband's occupation) 19572 or 390 per 1000 were in 1861 engaged in some industrial bread-earning occupation. This is a comparatively small proportion, for in London generally the proportion of workers is 432 per 1000. (Table X.) An excess of females in a population, and especially of non-working females, (if there be no special local causes for it) is an index of material prosperity. In our instance an equal number of bread-earning males are supporting in Islington a larger number of non-working females than in London generally. And material prosperity conduces to healthfulness. 7 9. The extent to wliicli certain trades and occupations are carried on in a district affects its healthiness and affects its death-rate. To trace out the influences of occupation upon our death-rate completely would be an almost endless task; I have however taken out from among the occupations followed by males 16, for comparison of their death-rate with that of the rest of our adult male population. Out of these sixteen there are eleven which with us predominate over London in the number of those which follow them. We have among us thus an excess of Law Clerks, Commercial Clerks, Schoolmasters, Printers, Goldsmiths, Jewellers, Watchmakers, Butchers, Carpenters and Joiners, Bricklayers, Plasterers, and Brickmakers. In the remaining five we stand more or less below London generally as to number, namely, Publicans, Bakers, Tailors, Shoemakers, and Labourers. In the case of the Females we have a slight excess of Schoolmistresses, Dressmakers and Milliners, Washerwomen, and Domestic Servants. The class of Needlewomen (a poverty, stricken and most heterogeneous class of persons) is, with us a comparatively small one. These five clases include 593 out of the 1000 of bread-earning women. The Domestic Servants alone form 391 per 1000 of them. Thus more than half of our occupied women appear devoted to ministering to the necessities of the wealthier part of our people. (Table XIII.) MORTALITY, DEATH-RATE, AND SICKNESS. The registered and tabulated mortality of the year 1864, exclusive of the deaths of strangers in our hospitals, amounted to 3843. We must add to this the number 234 being the share of deaths in various metropolitan institutions which would fall to us were those deaths apportioned out to the metropolitan districts in the proportion of their numerical strength.* With this addition our mortality amounts to 4077. If we follow our usual practice in the estimate of our population, it was in the middle of last year 181,896. The death-rate of the year would thus have been 224 per 10,000 living, a rate lower than that of 1863 when we calculated it at 227. Let us compare this with London. The death-rate of London last year was 264 per 10,000 being higher than it was in 1863 when the Registrar-General estimated it as 245 per 10,000. t In the Registrar-General's summaries, Islington always comes out badly, but then the Registrar-General counts among our deaths all those which take place from fever and small-pox in the special Hospitals devoted to those diseases. I mention this now because an instance of this sort of injustice appears in his Annual Summary of deaths in London for 1864. Ho there gives as the mortality of Islington for the five last years the following numbers. I place below them the corrected mortality as I hold it should be estimated. 1860 1861 1862 1863 1864 Registrar-General 3028 3123 3496 I 4560 Corrected Mortality 2992 3150 3217 3854 4077 * I am bound to say bore that although I take credit for so large a number, and have annually done so in accordance "with this rule of apportionment, there is reason to believe that I am treating our parish unjustly. From a return made last year to the House of Commons, it would appear that during the 10 years 1851—60, the aunual correction necessary on this account was only an addition of 20 for abouteach 2000 deaths. The true correction I presume would bo about the same now, or about 40 this year instead of 234. †The following table which I have compiled from a return made to the House of Commons, 8 No doubt some general cause has been in operation increasing the rate of mortality in the metropolis during the last two years or so, but I protest against any misconception of our position in this respect; for, whatever the cause may have been, it has not operated on our population to the degree that it has upon the population of the rest of the metropolis. We have felt its influence, but mildly. When we speculate as to what this influence may be, we must not omit to include in our consideration of causes, the increase in the price of meat, which will naturally tend to deprive the poor of a proper share of this element of a normal diet. It is difficult to over-estimate the importance of a sufficiency of animal food in the diet of the people; and this, not only as respects labouring men who must suffer in health, when the supply does not come up to the waste of tissue, but also as respects children, in whom not only re-construction, but a primary process of building up of a bodily frame is in progress. Growing children, if they are to become strong and healthy men and women, fitted to bear in after life the tax that will assuredly be laid upon their vital forces, should be supplied with at least two good meals of animal food every day. There can be no two opinions upon this subject, nor can we doubt that unless thus well fed, the youth of our population will be more liable to suffer from disease while young, and more likely to succomb under its attacks. On these grounds, then, it is a matter of profound satisfaction to observe that strenuous efforts are being made to introduce into this country animal food from distant places, where the beasts that can furnish it are at present sacrificed merely for the sake of their hides and fat. It is true that the efforts of one company formed for this purpose have not been at first so successful as might be wished, but there exist processes of preservation other than curing with salt, which there is reason to hope may ere long be brought into practical operation for this purpose.

It is to he recollected that Islington contains the Small-Pox and Fever Hospitals, and no correction is made for hospitals except in the number of deaths from "all causes," "at all ages." Hence a disproportionate number of deaths from small-pox, fever, and scarlatina i3 assigned to Islington. 9 The following Table represents tho Births which have been registered here during the year. 1864 West Sub-District.

The table of sickness among the poor (Table III.) is more satisfactory than the mortality tables. The total number of new cases of disease there recorded is 28,816, being a diminution upon the disease of last year to the extent of more than a tenth, namely, 3610 cases. When the tables of 1863 and 1864 are further compared, the improvement becomes still more obvious, for, with the'single exception of measles, there is no important class of maladies which does not exhibit a smaller number of cases in the table appended to the present report. DISTRICT MORTALITY. I propose saying very little upon this subject upon the present occasion. The death-rate in each of the 35 districts, as calculated upon Table II., and of the three groups into which they may be distributed iu accordance with the character |[ of each is seen in the following table. The mean of the first group is chiefly vitiated by the increasa in populate n. In the third group, always the most important for us, the Irish courts maintain The First group ombraccs the more wealthy districts, of which the numbers are not underlined, on my map. Those marked thus (*) have, by the erection of new buildings, greatly increased in population sinco the census; so that wherever a district is thus marked it mast, be understood that the death-rate, as I give it, is considerably above the true death-rate. Tho Second group embraces those districts with a more mixed population, of which the numbers are singly underlined on the map. The Third group embraces those with a population more or less poor and negligent, doubly underlined on the map. 10 their bad pre-eminence, although showing, as the result of some improvements they have undergone, a diminution in death-rate to tho extent of one-fourth.

Table I. exhibits the cause of death of 3843 persons, of whom 1843 were males and 2000 females, so that, if the proportion of males and females in our population is the same as in 1861, our male death-rate exceeds our female death-rate. In consequence of the small amount of those cases of contagious diseases to which children are liable, our zymotic mortality has fallon from 1356 in 1863 to 977. Small-pox especially has troubled us less: only 26 deaths from it were recorded during the year. About 27 of the deaths enumerated as due to fever appear to have been instances of typhus. But altogether this epidemic has dealt lightly with us. Tho most i mportant element in our mortality has been that heterogeneous class of maladies grouped together by the Registrar-General as "Local diseases." These, although to some extent influenced by local unwliolesomeness, are probably influenced still more by other circumstances, especially by weather. Our deaths from violent causes also were numerous, amounting to 90, of which 13 were deaths from homicide, and 15 from suicide. The deaths of children under 5 years were 170 less than in 1863. The distribution of the deaths from the most important diseases and classes of disease may be seen on reference to Table I. * In consequence of the accidental omission of the Canal district in the corresponding table of last year's report, the mean of the third group is there slated 27.3 in place of tho correct number now given. 11 OCCUPATION IN ITS RELATION TO MORTALITY. I have abridged my remarks upon the foregoing subjects that I might be able to say something upon the relation which the occupations of the people bear to our mortality. In former years I have passed very lightly over the subject of our adult mortality, nor can I do more than discuss one branch of the subject now. I have, as I stated previously, taken out from the census tables the number of persons over 20 years of age, following sixteen kinds of occupation among the males, and five kinds of occupation among the females. (Table VIII.) I have also gone through the schedules of mortality sent me by the Registrar-General for a period of seven years, namely for the years 1858 to 1864 inclusive, in order that I might have a sufficient number of deaths to deal with satisfactorily. The numerical results of this investigation are tabulated in Tables XIII. and XIV. I propose considering the mortality of the persons following each of these occupations separately, but before doing so, to avoid repetition, and at the same time to enable you to draw conclusions which it might be inexpedient that I should do more than hint at, I must ask permission to point out the usual causes of some of those fatal maladies mentioned on Table XIV. 1. The four first sets of diseases mentioned affect adults principally, who by residing in poor and overcrowded localities are most exposed to their contagia, or who are exposed to them directly as a consequence of the business in which they are employed. They are fatal also most especially to such as are irregular in their habits of life, whose diet is not sufficiently nutritious, and whose occupation tends to depress their general health. Typhoid fever, erysipelas, and puerperal fever are more closely connected than tho other miasmatic diseases with putridity and the emanations it generates. 2. The irregularities which give rise to delirium tremens and syphilis are both indications of a careless sort of life. 3. Kidney diseases and those allied maladies which are associated with chronic disturbance of the function of these important organs for purifying tho blood arise from various causes, but the most common is what is called free living, and especially habits of tippling—drinking for drinking's sake. Disease of this kind often brings in its train disease of the heart, apoplexy, and paralysis. 4. Diseases of the Liver again are commonly due to the same bad habit. Where ascites or abdominal dropsy is stated to be the cause of death, liver disease is mostly its origin. Habits of intoxication are not necessary for this effect, it is sufficient that persons habitually and frequently take spirituous drinks that they do not need, and especially when they take them in place of nutritious food, and to satisfy a morbid craving associated with disturbance of the digestive functions. More rarely diseases of the liver are the result of a constitutional taint. 5. Diseases of the Heart such as are actually registered as the cause of death are a common result of some previous attack of rheumatic fever, and liencc may be primarily attributed to those exposures to cold and wet which, with hard labour, insufficient food, and a poor condition of the blood, are ordinary causes of that disease. The connection of heart diseases with drinking habits is partly direct and partly indirect through the secondary influence upon the blood exerted by 12 damaged kidneys. It also arises when repeated attacks of bronchitis have produced such structural disease in the lungs (Emphysema), as lays more work upon the heart in forcing the blood through them. 6. Apoplexy, paralysis and their congeners are commonly associated with disease of the heart, partly as a result, partly as owning the same cause of structural degeneration or damaged blood from kidney disease. With or without the cooperation of these circumstances, apoplexy is favoured by those sorts of occupation which demand close attention, and such a position in work as retards the return of blood from the head by the veins of the neck. Paralysis is sometimes the result of slow metallic poisoning. 7. Bronchitis and asthma, (using the term popularly), as chronic diseases, (in which form adults mostly die from them), result chiefly from neglected catarrhs, and hence such deaths are frequently registered among those classes of persons who are most exposed to the inclemencies of the weather, and the exigencies of whose occupation preclude them from laying up when they take severe colds. They are also common complaints among persons who have, in their work, to make great muscular efforts, especially if with this they are exposed to the inhalation of air charged with irritating particles of dust. 8. Pneumonia (inflammation of the substance of the lungs), plewisy, Sc., are acute diseases favoured by pre-existant chronic disease of the heart or kidneys, by habits of intemperance, and also sometimes constitute the termination of tubercular affections of the lungs {phthisis). The immediate cause of the attack is usually some exposure to cold. 9. Phthisis (consumption) is, as every body knows, to some extent a disease the tendency to which is trau fitted from unhealthy (though not necessarily phthisical) parents to their offspring. But whether this hereditary tendency be present or not, the disease is liable to be established by those circumstances which tend to lower the nutrition of the body, and deprave the general health. Thus overwork, especially with irregular and unnatural habits of life, and an insufficient supply of nutritious food, and residence in a close, dark, damp, gloomy habitation, promote it. It is essentially a disease of nutrition, material incapable of development into natural healthy tissue being deposited in the lungs in place of material capable of forming well vitalised structure. An inordinate share of the anxieties of life promote it. But so far as occupation strictly is concerned, we find that it prevails largely among persons who undergo great fatigue, working hard in close insufficiently lighted, badly-ventilated, and crowded places, and withal who are debarred from a sufficiency of active bodily exercise in the open air and the occasional mental exhilaration which accompanies it. Another cause is daily working in an atmosphere loaded with irritating dust, whether this be earthy or metallic in its nature, or derived from woollen or other organic textures with which persons are engaged. Frequent exposures to damp and cold, especially when other causes are conjoined, seem, in some occupations that necessitate it, by occasioning frequent interference with the secreting function of the skin to promote this disease, as well as disturbance of the other great secreting organs, the liver and kidneys. 13 In the Table XIII. I have calculated the per centage of mortality for each sort of occupation mentioned for seven years. To obtain it for one average year then you have only to divide each number by seven. I may premise further, that for males of all classes indiscriminately over 20 years of age, our 7 years' death-rate (1858—64) was 11,088 per 10,000, or 1584 per 10,000 per annum. For females over 20 years our death-rate for the same period was 9,049 per 100,000, or 1,292 per 10,000 per annum. But it is scarcely fair to compare the business death-rates given in the tables with these numbers, inasmuch as the persons following them, after a certain time, if they survive, commonly retire into private life, and their former business is only occasionally mentioned in the mortality schedules. The proper comparison would be between the business death-rate and the death-rate of persons indiscriminately between the working ages of life. I must further state that, in consequence of this irregularity in the returns of death, I have excluded from my calculation of business deathrate all those deaths of persons who are said to have " formerly" followed any occupation. The same exclusion is made in the calculation of the expectation of life, but in giving the ages at death I have counted in all deaths without exclusion. a. MALES. 1. Publicans, Beerhouse-keepers, &c., stand highest with us in their rate of mortality. For the seven years it was 1,575 per 10,000, or 225 per 10,000 per annum. In England generally, their death-rate in 1851 was 308'4 ; so that somehow this class of persons with us, although their death-rate is very high, are better off than elsewhere. It is, however, one of the most fatal occupations with us, as it is throughout the kingdom. I find that at 20 years of age their expectation of life with us is 26 years. Tho expectation of life at 20 years of males generally, according to the English life table, is 40 years. In this respect they stand fourth in our list for short lives. Were it not that many persons only enter upon this occupation later in life than upon others, it is probable that, in accordance with their deathrate, they would stand much higher. In respect to this class, the Registrar-General properly remarks, " Many higlily-respectable'men of the class lead regular lives, and • are of steady habits ; but others, exposed by their business to unusual temptations, live intemperately, and enjoy less quiet at night than the rest of the community. They are exposed also to zymotic diseases by intercourse with large numbers of people."* The largest number with us die between 40 and 50 years of age. The diseases of which they chiefly die correspond with the Register-General's observation as to the probable cause of their high mortality. A very disproportionately large number die from gout, dropsy, kidney and liver disease, and also from diseases of the nervous system, apoplexy, and paralysis, the latter deaths being out of all proportion to the deaths from heart diseases. Our publicans, too, show the largest number of deaths from delirium tremens. 2. Labourers stand second on our list for high death-rate, viz.: 1,299 per 10,000 for seven years, or 185 per annum. In early death they stand sixth, their expectation of life at 20 years old being 28 years. For England generally, the death-rate in 1851 * Annual Report of the Registrar-General for 1851, p. xxi. 14 was 216 3. Working mostly in the open air, they would doubtless live longer if they were more wholesomely lodged and spent less of their time at the publichouse. Their death-rate, too, will tend to become less as the extended use of machinery relieves them of doing the work of mere animals. The unwholesomeness of their habitations is shown by the enormous proportion of their deaths from the miasmatic diseases. Heart diseases, apoplexy and paralysis, chronic bronchitic affections, inflammatory chest diseases and phthisis, with kidney disease, as leading causes of death, testify to the unfavourable conditions under which they live and labour. Bricklayers and builders' labourers seem especially prone to die from phthisis; 20 out of 44 deaths of such persons on my returns, or 45'4 per cent., were from this disease. Probably the dusty atmosphere they breathe is the main cause of this large proportion. Their expectation of life is 27 years. I find on my list four deaths of sewer labourers. All died comparatively young—two aged 32 years, one aged 48, and one aged 49, the mean age at death being 40 years. Two died of bronchitis, one of phthisis, and one of disease of the heart. 3. Brickmakers stand third. Their death-rate is 1,237 per 10,000 for seven years, or 176 per annum. Their expectation of life is 38 years; that is, they appear to come close upon the average for England generally. This discrepancy may be accounted for. The brickmakers usually commence their occupation as " brickfield labourers." Most of the latter rise uo higher; but the more intelligent and teachable rise in time to work under the sheds, but usually not much before the age of 30 years. Good brickmakers, I am informed, are difficult to obtain. I distinguish between brickmakers and brickfield labourers. The latter commence as boys, and at 20 years of age have, with us, an expectation of life of 30 years. Brickmakers obtain good wages, but are very improvident; more than half the deaths on my table took place in the workhonw. They suffer from their customary habitations, much as labourers do; and acute chest diseases carried off a large proportion. On the other hand, their working in places open to the air and with materials moist, and so not giving off dust, gives them a remarkable immunity from phthisis. Were these people habitually temperate and provident, their trade would prove, I am convinced, one of the most salubrious of those followed in their rank of life. 4. Law Clerks, including law-writers, rank next. Their seven years'death-rate was 1,147 per 100,00, or 163 per annum. Their expectation of life with us at 20 is 25 years. Now these are a class of persons who enter upon their occupation young; and although a small portion of them subsequently raise themselves to a higher rank in the profession of the law, or enter upon other occupations, as accountants, (fee., yet the majority, commencing with a poor education, remain law clerks or law-writers all their lives. They have a high mortality from the miasmatic diseases and phthisis. As a class, I am informed, to which of course there are honourable exceptions, they are not remarkable for leading steady lives. Still law clerks have often plenty of exercise and are not, as a rule, liable to work late. But they have to support their families upon very moderate earnings; and if unsteady, both themselves and families are liable to suffer from an insulfiency of nutritious food, and they are compelled to reside in localities where they are exposed to contagia. 5. Shoemakers exhibit with us a death-rate of 931 per 10,000 in seven years, or of 133 per annum. In England generally in 1851 it was 186 per 10,000. Their 15 expectation of life at 20 is 34 years. They exhibit a high mortality from apoplexy, paralysis, and other diseases of the nervous system, probably in a measure due to their sedentary mode of life and the posture in which they work, and perhaps also to irregular habits. Their mortality from phthisis is about one in four of the deaths. Altogether, in itself, shoemaking does not appear to be so unhealthy as some occupations on our list. 6. Bakers.—I have already stated some particulars about this trade in one of my monthly reports (No. XC.). Their seven years' death-rate was 916 per 10,000, or 132 per annum. Iu England in 1851 it i3 stated at 178. Here again we seem to have some advantage. Their expectation of life at 20, calculated on our seven years experience, is 28 years. The unnatural life our bakers lead is sufficiently familiar to you. The fatal diseases to which such a life, the extremes of temperature to which they are exposed, and the heavy weights they sometimes have to lift and carry all predispose them are bronchitic and asthmatic diseases (including emphjsema of the lungs), heart disease, apoplexy, paralysis, &c. The deaths frcm bronchitis constitute 25-8 per cent., and from phthsis 24 2 per cent., that is to say, half the deaths of bakers arise from these two diseases directly, and another fourth from heart disease, paralysis, &c. The remedy for all this is obvious. 7. Carpenters and Joiners have with us together a seven years' death-rate of 852 per 10,000, or 121 per annum. For England generally it is stated at 194. Their expectation of life is 31 years at 20 years of age. They seem to suffer considerably from fatal miasmatic diseases, probably the result, in the case of journeymen, of unwholesome domiciles. They suffer equally with bakers from phthisis, but less than them from bronchitic and heart diseases, although their bronchitic mortality is still considerable. They show a considerable mortality from apoplexy, paralysis, and other diseases of the nervous system, which, as their mortality from heart disease is not large, is probably associated with other causes. Carpenters are in excess in this parish, being employed about new buildings, where they are exposed to draughts of cold air and have sometimes to raise heavy weights. It is important to note that the joiners who work in close dusty workshops, differ in many respects from the carpenters, for their expectation of life is much shorter; it does not exceed 24 years at 20. They suffer less from fatal bronchitis (147 per cent.) ; but their mortality from consumption is very highs 44 out of every 100 deaths being from this cause. They have a lower mortality from heart disease (8'8), and a higher one from kidney diseases (8'8). They would live longer if their workshops were well ventilated and kept free from accumulated wood-dust, some means being taken also to lay the dust during working hours. 8. Tailors.—The seven years' death-rate of our tailors is 837 per 10,000, or 119 per annum. In England in 1851 it was 199 per 10,000. The great difference probably arises from our tailors not working in large crowded establishments like some of those in the City and at the West End of London. Their expectation of life is 33 years, a little lower only than that of our shoemakers. They exhibit a high mortality from bronchitic affections and phthisis; half the deaths or thereabouts proceeding from these two diseases, the result very probably of close confinement, a hot dusty atmosphere, and judging from the prevalence of liver aud kidney disease, one 16 would be disposed to conclude from somewhat diisipated habits out of working hours. The per centage of deaths from apoplexy, paralysis, <fcc., is the same as with shoemakers ; and probably similar causes are in operation, as the death-rate from heart disease is not correspondingly high. 9. Watch and Clockmakers exhibit a seven years' death-rate of 834 per 10,000, equal to 119 per annum. Their expectation of life is 28 years. Their largest mortality is from paralysis, next from apoplexy and other diseases of the nervous system. Theie diseases together account for 22 5 per cent, of the deaths. Evidently this is not due to any peculiar tendency to heart disease (6'4 per cent.) Judging from their small number of deaths from kidney and liver disease, it does not seem to be connected with intemperate habits in this class of persons. The only other disease which carries off any considerable number is phthisis, from which nearly one-fourth of them die. No less than 19 3 per cent, of the deaths were from cerebral or spinal paralysis and disease of the brain (putting apoplexy out of the question). The cause of both the»e fatal diseases is probably the same, namely, the action of copper. The inhalation of copper dust is, with their sedantry habits, probably the principal cause of their liability to phthisis—a relation pointed out a few years ago by M. Perron in the case of the watchmakers of Besangon, while the accidental, but probably habitual, slow ingestion of copper, from the fine dust getting upon the food from the atmosphere or from the workmen's hands, seems to account for the corresponding tendency to fatal paralytic diseases. The latter, at all events, could be guarded against by habitual ablution before meals and by not taking them in the same room where work is goirfg on. 10. Plasterers show a seven years' death-rate of 829 per 10,000, or 118 per annum. Their expectation of life at 20, so far as our limited experience goes, is 29 years. Their principal mortality was from phthisis (25'9 per cent.) and paralysis, with disease of the brain and epilepsy, altogether 25 9 per cent. The latter is due apparently to some other causes than those which operate in producing heart disease. Some light seems thrown upon the cause in finding 7'4 per cent, of deaths from gout and dropsy. I do not know enough of the special habits of this class of persons to speculate further upon the subject. 11. Butchers have, with us, a seven years' death-rate of 793 per 10,000, or 117 per annum. This is low ; for the death-rate of butchers in all England for 1851 was 213. The more favourable position in which our butchers stand is probably due to the more wholesome circumstances in which they live and work. Their expectation of life at 20 years is however short, being only 25 years. The largest proportion die between 40 and 60. As causes cf high mortality among butchers, the Registrar-General suggests a diet into which too much animal food and too little fruit and vegetables enter, drinking to excess, exposure to heat and cold, and, as probably the most powerful cause, the elements of decaying matter by which butchers are surrounded in the slaughterhouse and its vicinity. I think other causes might be suggested, as the damp and wet to which they are constantly exposed out of doors and in the slaughter houses, the fatigues they have to encounter, and the heavy weights they have often to raise and carry. The mortality from phthisis forms 44'6 per cent, of all the deaths; and the mortality from kidney and liver diseases is sufficiently high to lead to the suspicion of 17 the influence of unsteady habits. Still it is not improbable that any tendency to kidney disease may be due to the same habitual chilling of the skin which favours the occurrence of phthisis. Young butchers always seem to me to be leading an uncomfortable sort of life. 12. Printers.—We have twice our proper share of these living in Islington. Their seven years' death-rate is 769 per 10,000, or 107 per annum. Their expectation of life is very low—only 24 years. Our printers seem to have suffered disproportionately from fatal fevers and from that class of diseases to which erysipelas belongs, as if indeed, their work places exposed them, in some way that I cannot understand, to putrid miasmata; but it may be that their degraded health renders them more liable than any others to suffer from miasmata, to which they are exposed elsewhere. They have a high mortality from acute inflammations of the chest, probably from sudden alternations of temperature; and they show nearly the largest proportion of deaths from heart disease, very likely the result, through rheumatic fever, of the same cause. Printers, according to Dr. Edward Smith, are considerably liable to take cold. They stand pretty high also in fatal diseases of the liver and kidneys, and nearly a third of the deaths are from phthisis. The compositor comes off worst in the latter respect; for while, among those engaged in other branches of the business, only 21'6 per cent, of the deaths are attributed to consumption, the compositors' deaths from it form 42'4 per cent, of all their deaths. They suffer much at the same rate from heart disease as do those following other branches of the business. Heins Van Holzbeeck enumerates, as the principal cause of disease among printers, impurity of the atmosphere from gas, moisture, and turpentine, crowding and working at night. Dr. Edward Smith adds to these causes, in the case of the compositor, dirt and bad ventilation in the workrooms, overwork, unsteady habits, and metallic poisoning from the type. The dust from the "cases" has been found to contain lead, copper, antimony, and arsenic. The men are the more likely to suffer from this in consequence of their frequently taking one or two meals in the room in which they work. 13. Commercial Clerks.—I have much difficulty in dealing with these; because it is not once a commercial clerk, always a commercial clerk. It is a class formed in large proportion of educated young men of a respectable rank in life, who, after a time, enter into more advanced grades of commercial life. Still our table tells a sad tale respecting them. The death-rate, for the reason above assigned, cannot be relied upon ; but it is very evident that if young men entering upon the life of a commercial clerk, as they do on leaving school, continue in it and rise no higher, they have at the age of 20 a reasonable expectation of only living 18 years. Out of 198 deaths I have on record over 20 years of age (and I hava a vast number under that age), no less than 69 (more than a third) took place within ten years ; and more thaa a third of the deaths of those left and continuing their occupation took place within the next 10 years. Looking at the causes of death of these persons, we must be struck with the fact of 46 4 or nearly half the deaths being produced by consumption. The deaths from syphilis, delirium tremens, and kidney diseases point to dissipated habits of life. But to what is this high fatality from consumption due ? I believe mainly to two causes, which it is for employers to remove, if the high pressure at which business is carried on now-a-dayi will permit of it. In the case of clerks employed all day, tied 18 down at the desk, to their sedentary life, in close, gas-lighted, unventilated countinghouses and offices; in the case of other young clerks, to intense bodily fatigue, their duties compelling them to be upon their legs about town nearly all day, without regular hours or sufficient time afforded for meals; and in the case of both, to unnatural and murderously late hours of business. The youthful frame cannot bear all this with impunity. 14. Goldsmiths, Silversmiths, and Jewellers.—It is unfortunate that in the census tables these are thrown into one group, for the character of the occupations differs. All I can say about them, therefore, appears upon the tables. This is the more unfortunate as we have a large number of persons in Islington following these occupations. Altogether their deaths from phthisis, apoplexy, and paralysis are high, and they seem to suffer disproportionally from kidney and liver diseases. 15. Bricklayers come vastly better off than the labourers who assist them ; they are less exposed than the latter to some causes of disease, and especially to the causes of phthisis. They show a seven years' death-rate of 675 per 10,000, or 96 per annum. Their expectation of life is 34 years. They seem chiefly to die from acute and chronic diseases of the chest (excluding phthisis), the result of exposure, and from miasmatic diseases, probably derived from their residences. They exhibit a high proportion of fatal liver disease. The high proportion of heart disease is probably the result, through rheumatism or bronchitis, of exposure to cold and we.t. 16. Schoolmasters.—Only a small proportion of these died, the expectation of life, from our limited experience, being 34 years. b. FEMALES. The rate of mortality of females following industrial occupations cannot be estimated, nor yet, fairly, the average age at death, in consequence of the imperfection of the mortuary returns, which in the instance of married women do not in all cases specify the occupation followed. The particulars as to the cause of death, as given in Table XIV., are open to fewer crbjections on this score. Dressmakers and Milliners appear to die to a large extent from consumption, 42 per cent, of the deaths being attributable to this cause. There is no difficulty in associating this with the damage inflicted upon the health from excessive and late hours of work in close, crowded, and confined rooms, together with deficient bodily exercise. The large proportion of young persons following these occupations, who at a later period of life are lost sight of in consequence of marriage will also —as in the case of commercial clerks—partly account for the high death-rate from phthisis. They seem unusually exposed to suffer from fever and other miasmatic diseaies. Needlewomen suffer more from poverty, innutritious food, misery, and driifk. Their occupation, as returned, both in the census tables and the mortuary schedules, is in numerous instances probably only ostensible. Phthisis, bronchitic affections, and kidney diseases point to the causes of disease I have enumerated, together with exposure. Three out of the 57 deaths were of single women from puerperal fever, and one was from syphilis. When it is recollected that we have but 71'2 women thus returned at the census, and how small a proportion of women die thus in childbed, and how little fatal a disease adult syphilis is there can be no difficulty in accepting the conclusion 19 which''these numbers indicate. Domestic Servant* die to the extent of one-fourth from phthisis, especially in the earlier ages; at later periods of life from bronchitis. The deaths from diseases of the nervous system other than apoplexy, that is from paralysis and diseases of the brain and spinal cord, are high ; and they also seem to suffer severely from disorders of the digestive system. Every dispensary physician is aware of all this. And the explanation lies in the hard life they commonly lead, hard work, daily fatigue, insufficient rest, unhealthy sleeping rooms (a room on the basement, or underground, or an unventilated garret, and commonly the worst room in the house being allotted to the maid-of-all-work), and not always a very liberal diet, completing in their case what an infancy and youth passed under unfavourable sanitary conditions had left unfinished. As regards the large proportion of deaths from the miasmatic diseases, small-pox, fever, &c., the parallelism with the mortality of labourers (both mostly proceeding from the same rank of life) is remarkable. The deaths from fever are especially noticeable; experience seems to show that domestic servants suffer largely from "enteric fever," from their disproportionate exposure to drain emanations at the lower part of the houses they live in. Few sinks in the kitchens, even of good houses, are properly trapped, and the servants are the first to suffer from the neglect. An inefficient bell-trap is usually all that is provided.* Where houses are built upon rubbish, filling in the site of former excavations, another source of malaria and specific poison is provided for the denizens of the kitchen. We all know what this rubbish consists of. Seven of the deaths recorded were from " puerperal fever." Laundresses seem to suffer to about the same extent from fever, probably partly due to their residences and partly to the clothing of fever patients which they come into contact with. Their most remarkable mortality, however, is from chronic bronchitic, and heart diseases, the direct result of their business. The deaths of our Schoolmistresses are too few to comment upon. SANITARY WORK OF THE YEAR. All that relates to dwelling-houses and the improvements effected in them, appears on Table XV. The number of houses systematically inspected was 1,333. I may state, as a general fact, that during the past year the inspectors have found less overcrowding than heretofore. I have had occasion to interfere in one instance where a number of girls were crowded into two small rooms to work at flower making, on account of typhus fever spreading among them. On the occasion of the annual licensing, all the slaughter-houses and cowsheds in the parish were personally inspected by myself, and those that I objected to by the Sanitary Committee also. The number of slaughterhouses licensed was 108, and the number of cowsheds 71. Licences were refused to seven slaughter-houses (in four instances where a licence had formerly been granted), on the ground of their being no longer necessary, the shops to which they were attached having been closed and the locality being objectionable. Several cowkeepers, whose sheds and yards had during the year been frequently subject to complaints of uneleanliness, although their licences were granted, were warned that if similar complaints arose a second time the licence will be withdrawn. In one * There ought always to bo a " syphon-trap" at the junction between tho pipe descending from the sink and the drain. 20 instance a licence was withdrawn in consequence of refusal to make the necessary amendments. The magistrates thus strengthen the hands of the sanitary authorities of the parish. With the assistance of Mr. Godbold (whom the Vestry appointed for three months as bakehouse inspector), 192 bakehouses were inspected. My monthly Report for September contains an abstract of the results of the inspection. Since that time, a great deal has been done in the way of improving the cleanliness of these places ; but nothing less than a constant system of inspection will suffice to prevent their relapse. During the year the inspectors have seized 2,655 lbs. of meat unfit for food, and several rabbits and fowls—all which have been condemned by the magistrates to be destroyed; and fines have been inflicted in three instances, to the total extent of £55, on the further prosecution of the offenders. One of the worst of these cases came to light during the bakehouse inspections. Parcels of fish, fruit, and vegetables have frequently been seized and destroyed. One slaughter-house in the Brandon-road, Belle Isle, which was habitually used for the slaughter of deceased cattle, has been closed by refusal of the magistrate to grant a licence. This is the second time that a licence has been refused upon this ground. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your very obedient Servant, EDWABD BALLARD, M.D., M.R.C.P., Medieal Officer of Health. Vestry Offices, April 3rd, 1865. TABLE I.
