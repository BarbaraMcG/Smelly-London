To: The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my annual report on the health and sanitary circumstances in the Borough of Fulham for the year 1956, together with that of your Public Analyst, Mr. T. McLachlan, A.C.G.F.C., F.R. I.C. I am pleased to report on the continued satisfactory state of public health in the Borough during the year. Population The number of births exceeded deaths by 411, so there was a natural increase of population. The Registrar General's estimate of the population as at the middle of 1956 was 117,100. Births The number of births was 1,735 - 912 males and 823 females, giving a rate of 14.82 Per 1,000 population. Deaths There were 1,324 deaths of Fulham residents during the year, giving a general death rate of 11.31 - the figure for 1955 being 11.0. Diseases of the heart and other coronary conditions (including stress diseases) - 372, were again responsible for the largest number of deaths and showed an increase on the 1955 figure (341). Deaths from cancer were not materially different from the previous year. There was a slight rise in the number of deaths from all accidents, whereas deaths from motor accidents showed a slight drop. No death occurred in Fulham attributable to pregnancy or child-birth. It is gratifying to record a considerable decline in the number of deaths from tuberculosis i.e. from 27 in 1955 to 14 in 1956; the increased number of notifications of tuberculosis reflects the earlier detection of the disease. Infectious Diseases No major epidemic illness occurred during the year but Fulham did not escape a series of Poliomyelitis cases (17 confirmed cases). The total number of notifications of infectious diseases (682) fell considerably compared with 1955 (2,361), when there was a big measles epidemic. Notifications of scarlet fever fell from 73 in 1955 to 44 in 1956, whilst notifications of dysentery showed an increase of 28. Atmospheric Pollution The Atmospheric Pollution Stations set up by the Council at the request of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in 1953 have continued to function during the year and have afforded valuable information of grit and smoke in various areas of the Borough. Owing to Fulham s geographical situation and long river boundary on the fringe of which several public undertakings and industrial works are sited, the investigation and prevention of atmospheric pollution is always a priority. It should be remembered that in these industries 1% million tons of coal are burned each year, to which should be added 60,000 tons which are burned for domestic purposes. Legislation, i.e. the Clean Air Act 1956 quickly followed the Beaver Committee s Report on Atmospheric Pollution and certain sections of the Clean Air Act became law on 31st December, 1956, Included in these sections is the provision of Smoke Control Areas. In January 1956 a fog occurred in the Metropolitan Area, which persisted for three days, the effects of which are referred to in another part of the report (page 12). Food and Drugs Act. 1955 Food Hygiene Regulations, made under the Food and Drugs Act came into operation in two stages (a) on the 1st January, 1956 and (b) on the 1st July, 1956. The coming of these Regulations was a major event from the point of view of food hygiene, which included food handlers and the food premises as well as the food itself. They were made with the express purpose of preventing food poisoning and securing clean and safe food all along the line from manufacturer or producer to consumer, whether they are served in the open or in a shop or cafe. Meetings were held with heads and owners of businesses. Canteen Managers and Street Traders in the Borough. All sections of the community dealing with food have shown interest and concern to comply with the Regulations. In the first year of working of the Regulations, there has been some definite improvement in the standards of hygiene and whilst much remains to be done, there is every prospect that the Council s continued policy of seeing that the public get clean safe food, handled by clean food handlers, stored and served in clean food premises, is being increasingly implemented and operated to the advantage of all. A "Clean Food Campaign" was held from October 1956 to March, 1957 ; during which time good and effective work was done amongst the food traders but the public response was somewhat disappointing, A full report of the campaign appears on page 64. Care of the Elderly This has been carried out by the Council s Old People's Welfare Committee which is constantly expanding its activities and by Voluntary Associations. Statutory visiting by the Council s Lady Public Health Inspector regarding assessment under the National Assistance Act. 1948. Section 47, was actively continued. In the section of this report which deals with "Personal Services, " the Council is privileged to have contributions from several eminent workers in various fields, which touch on the lives of the citizens of Fulham. I cordially thank the writers for their very interesting and informative contributions, which are as follows Dr. W. H. Keileher, Physician Superintendent Western Hospital, on the work of the Hospital. Dr. F. A. Nash Medical Director of South West London Mass X Ray Service, for his report on the Mass Radiography Unit, which is now permanently stationed in Fulham. Dr. H. C. Price, Chest Physician, Fulham Chest Clinic, for permission to quote from his Annual Report. Dr. A. L. Wyman, Physician Superintendent, Fulham Hospital, for his contribution on the welfare of the elderly. During the year we have said good-bye with sincere regret to Dr. Violet I. Russell, London County Council Divisional Medical Officer, with whom and with her staff our relations as a department have been happy and co-operative. Dr. Russell has our best wishes for health and happiness in her leisure time. We welcome Dr. Bertha E. A, Sharpe as Dr. Russell s successor. We had the pleasure of a visit of 12 Nigerian Sanitary Inspectors, the visit being arranged by the British Council for them to see the work of Local Authorities in relation to Public Health Law and Practice. The Sanitary Inspectors (Change of Designation) Act, 1956 had the effect of redesignating the Sanitary Inspectors as Public Health Inspectors - a designation more in keeping with their present-day duties. There is still a grave shortage of Public Health Inspectors generally but this Council is making a valuable contribution with their scheme of taking students to train as Public Health Inspectors, At present there are three in training and since the scheme started., three have obtained the statutory qualification. Finally, I am indebted to all the Members of the Council for their helpful co-operaion at all times and especially to the Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen of the Public Health and Staff Committees of the Council for their sympathetic consideration of Public Health problems. I should like to record my appreciation of the unfailing assistance and help of my fellow Chief Officers and the members of their Departments and finally to my deputy, Dr. C. A. Meade and the staff of the Public Health Department (The Public Health Team!) my grateful appreciation for the loyalty and efficiency with which each one has carried out their duties and made this report again possible. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant r L Medical Officer of Health.

Chelsea in the east and the Royal Borough of Kensington in the north. It is very flat and low lying being only 12 - 23 ft. above sea level. The subsoil is of flood plain gravel overlying London clay 20 to 40 feet below Subsoil water is rarely met within 15 feet of the ground surface Fulham is principally a dormitory Borough with a fringe of heavy industrial undertakings on the riverside and is well served with open spaces and parks which have been added to by post-war development. The slum clearance and redevelopment programmes are also having the dual effect of improving the standard of housing and the appearance of the Borough POPULATION (estimated mid 1956) 117,100 AREA of Borough 1,706 acres SEPARATE DWELLINGS (estimated at April 1956) 30,353 Rateable Value £1,853,383. The rateable value of every property in the Borough was reassessed w.e.f. 1.4.56 and the effect of this revaluation was to increase the Rateable value of the Borough by £667,182.

P. D. Logan, M.D, Ph. D., D.P.H., Chief Medical Statistician, General Register Office who says writing in the British Medical Journal of March 31st 1956.page 722 "There was some fog in the London area on January 3rd 1956, This became thick on the morning of January 5th and persisted until the morning of January 6th when it began to disperse Fog was widespread throughout much of the rest of the country at the same time, and in some places continued longer In London the fog was thick enough to cause very severe disruption of traffic, particularly on the evening of January 5th Newspapers carried headlines about killer smog', described the widespread investigations that were being conducted during the fog into the degree of atmospheric pollution that was taking place, and reminded readers that the previous severe London fog, in December, 1952, had caused several thousand deaths in the London area Following the fog of December 1952, a period of some weeks had to elapse before the mortality returns could be analysed and the total number of deaths due to the fog could be estimated-about 4,000 deaths in the Greater London area (Logan 1953 Ministry of Health 1954).After a similar delay it is now possible to give a corresponding estimate for the January fog of this year - about 1,000 deaths in the Greater London Area". The number of deaths occurring each day from December 25th 1955, to January 19th 1956, in the London Administrative County are shown in Table I.

The Notification Rate has increased from 91.0 in 1955 to 121.3 in 1956. 17 TUBERCULOSIS Comparison between deaths and notifications for the past 10 years 18 AUTHENTICATION OF VACCINATION AND INOCULATION CERTIFICATES In several parts of the world certificates of vaccination and/or inoculation are not accepted unless they are endorsed by a Medical Officer in the Government or Municipal Service of the country of issue. The form of authentication which appears to be most readily accepted by Health Authorities abroad is that given by Public Health Authorities, whereby practitioners signatures are verified by the Medical Officer of Health. The Minister of Health therefore has asked Local Authorities to make arrange ments under which any person who desires to have a certificate of vaccination or inoculation for the purpose of travel abroad may have it stamped accordingly at the office of the Health Department. The purpose of the authentication is to provide proof to those Health Authorities abroad who desire it that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. Authenticators are not required to certify that the vaccination or inoculation has been properly carried out or. indeed., that it has been carried out at all; the responsibility for issuing the certificate remains with the doctor signing it. This does not imply any suggestion that a certificate of vaccination or inocula tion issued by a registered Medical Practitioner requires any, official supervision or control in order to be of adequate medical value. Authentication is not a require ment of Her Majesty s Government but the proposal is designed as a remedy for difficulties which have in practice been met by persons from this country travelling abroad. During the year a total of 457 certificates of vaccination and/or inoculation were authenticated BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS The following bacteriological examinations were carried out for the Council on specimens submitted by general practitioners and the Public Health Department during the year.

REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE WESTERN HOSPITAL YEAR ENDED 31ST DECEMBER. 1956 SUPPLIED BY COURTESY OF DR. W.H. KELLEHER, PHYSICIAN SUPERINTENDENT Infectious Diseases Unit 1,409 patients suffering from infectious or suspected infectious disease were admitted during the year by far the larger proportion being children under fourteen years. Most of the patients came from the London Boroughs but some, mostly cases of poliomyelitis were admitted from the Home Counties or even further afield, Although the incidence of the disease was not so high as in 1955, 256 cases of Poliomyelitis or suspected poliomyelitis were admitted The diagnosis was confirmed in 125 cases 93 being of the paralytic and 32 of the non-paralytic type (Comparable figures for 1955 were:- Paralytic cases - 123: Non-paralytic cases 66), 21 35 cases with respiratory involvement, most of them very severe, were treated in the poliomyelitis respiratory unit. Many of these patients were transferred from other hospitals in the Region because they needed treatment with some of the special equipment based here. In a number of instances it was necessary to send an ambulance with a portable respirator and a member of our medical team to accompany the patient. The facility now available, in the case of adult female patients requiring prolonged physiotherapy treatment following their acute illness, of transfer to the Rehabilitation Ward instead of to another hospital, has proved a great advantage to both patients and staff in that a feeling of continuity of treatment in the same hospital is preserved. A final comment, which may be of interest, is that several cases of diphtheria of a serious type were admitted during the year, with one death. Tuberculosis Unit During the year 169 patients were admitted to the Tuberculosis Wards as compared with 187 in 1955 and 146 in 1954. Most of the patients came from the Fulham area, admitted through the Fulham Chest Clinic, The demand for beds has slowly decreased over the past few years to the point where female patients requiring to enter hospital can invariably be admitted immediately, and although the demand for male beds is greater, patients rarely have to wait for more than a few days. The decrease in the demand for female beds has made it possible to allocate a small number of beds for the treatment of male patients suffering from non-tuberculous chest disease. (H) The death rate for 1956 was 8% compared with 16% in 1955 a6nd 17% in 1954. It is also now possible, by arrangement with the Clinic, to offer practitioners in the area a bronchoscopic diagnostic service within a few days of application. Rehabilitation Unit The Rehabilitation Unit, which was opened in October 1955, has admitted just on 100 patients. All were females, of any age over 15 years and they included poliomyelitics, hemiplegics. arthritics, bronchitics, and orthopaedic and fracture cases. One patient died from an extraneous cause and four patients were transferred to chronic sick units. The remainder of the cases were successfully rehabilitated to the extent that every one could dress and feed herself, could walk and lead an independent existence. Co-ordinated by the Sister-in-Charge of the ward, every single act of the patient, from awakening in the morning to retiring to sleep at night, has been regarded as an essential treatment ranking in importance to orthodox physiotherapy. Where necessary, instruction has been given in the ward kitchen in the preparation of meals. Application of these principles has proved to be the means whereby patients, very seriously incapacitated and (in some instances) regarded as permanently crippled, can be restored to independence in spite of their handicaps and can be redeemed to live a life in the light, rather than the shadow, of their pathology. The experience so far gained has encouraged the hope that a male ward may be opened soon. NOTE: All the figures given in this report relate to the Western Hospital and not to Fulham. 22 THE SOUTH WEST LONDON MASS X RAY SERVICE FULHAM - 1956 SUPPLIED BY COURTESY OF DR. F.A. NASH, MEDICAL DIRECTOR During 1956 Mobile Units of the South West London Mass X-Ray Service provided chest x-ray facilities for the employees of 9 firms and organisations in the Borough, during which a total of 2,616 people were x-rayed and 18 cases referred to chest clinics with a radiologically significant lesion, probably tuberculous, requiring further investigation In addition, 3 separate visits were made to the Fulham Chest Clinic where 670 contacts were examined, from which 2 cases were referred to chest clinics with a radiologically significant lesion, probably tuberculous, requiring further investigation In April the Headquarters of the South West London Mass X-Ray Service were transferred from the Grove Hospital, Tooting, to the Western Hospital, Seagrave Road, Fulham: and in September a Mass X-Ray Centre was opened there to provide facilities for doctors' patients, contacts, organised parties from firms and organisations and members of the public on four days per week By the end of the year 5,061 examinees had attended and 40 cases had been referred to chest clinics with a radiologically significant lesion, probably tuberculous, requiring further investigation A special campaign was initiated in October with the object of persuading all male residents in the Borough, in the age group 45 +, to be x-rayed. 5,428 letters were addressed personally to men selected from the Register of Electors, as a result of which 585 attended of whom 445 were in the 45 + age group and 394 of them were 45 + and not previously x-rayed. This campaign is continuing throughout 1957. EXTRACTS FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT OF DR. H. C. PRICE, CHEST PHYSICIAN, FULHAM CHEST CLINIC, 1956 The number of new notifications of pulmonary tuberculosis during the year rose from 30 to 63. The number of new patients referred to the clinic this year rose from 441 for 1955 to 518. Of these, 237 were referred for non-tuberculous diseases compared with 157 for the previous year A further illustration of the increasing emphasis on non-tuberculous patients is shown by a comparison of the attendance figures, those for tuberculous cases numbering 2,843 compared with 2,790 for 1955 - an increase of 53, whereas the attendances for the non-tuberculous patients rose from 627 to 922, an increase of 295 The total attendance figure has fallen from 7,711 to 7,588, in spite of the increased number of patients seen, due to the steady decrease in the number of patients attending the artificial pneumothorax refill sessions, as the figure has dropped from 2,172 to 1,330 - a fall of 842 - for these sessions. The Changing Face of the Chest Clinic The most significant change in this year's report is the very considerable reduction in the number of attendances at the refill clinics, a trend which was already apparent in 1955 but which has become more marked during 1956 when no artificial pneumothoraces were advised and only six patients had pneumoperitoneums induced. 23 This trend first became obvious in 1955 though prior to this date chemotherapy was already beginning to displace this type of therapy for many of the early, soft, non cavitating type of lesions. Since 1955, however, events have moved more rapidly and. as stated, minor collapse therapy now plays an insignificant, if not rapidly vanishing part, in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. The place vacated by minor collapse therapy has been taken by chemotherapy. The activities of the Health Visitors Staff has resulted in an increase in the number of contacts examined - 2,493 compared with 2,122 in 1955, an increase of 371 and in the number of B.C.G. vaccinations completed and followed-up. Rehabilitation Regular rehabilitation sessions between the Physician, the Almoner and the Disable ment Resettlement Officer from the Ministry of Labour have restarted during the year and are making good progress so far. There is no logical reason why in a period of full employment every disabled person should not be found a suitable type of work. Chronic Bronchitis Clinic For some years now four beds have been available at the Western Hospital for the investigation and treatment of non-tuberculous chest diseases. These beds are usually fully occupied by cases of acute bronchiolitis, complicating chronic bronchitis, by bronchiectasis and cancer of the lung. These beds are run in conjunction with the bronchitis clinic sessions at the Chest Clinic. Here full investigation into the patients condition can be carried out, including electro-cardiography and respiratory function tests. Dr. L. Grant is now able to carry out a bronchoscopic session at the Western Hospital each Wednesday afternoon, and so far has been able to deal with all those cases referred to him without any waiting period. The respiratory function unit and non-tuberculous beds at King George V. Chest Hospital, Godalming, provide additional in-patient facilities for the bronchitis clinic. In September 1956 a special survey was commenced in conjunction with the local General Practitioners, Dr. Mary Adams, the Medical Officer of Health, her deputy, Dr. C.A. Meade, and Dr. Hurford at King George V. Chest Hospital, Godalming, to evaluate the efficacy of breathing 4% ammonia vapour by patients with chronic bronchitis; the final results will be assessed by a comparison of the number of spells of sickness absence in the treated and control groups. This survey was also carried out in cooperation with Dr. E. W. Wilkins of the Fuel Research Station, Greenwich, Mr. Veryard of the Meteorological Office, the Bronchitis Committee of the Medical Research Council, and the assistance of Messrs. Airwick Ltd. In order to provide a base line for this experimental work, a small meteorological station was set up at the clinic with the help of; Dr. Adam,s Dr. Wilkins and Mr. Veryard. enabling continuous readings of sulphur dioxide, relative humidity, temperature and smoke to be made The necessary apparatus having been kindly loaned by the departments concerned Because chronic bronchitis does not provide the doctor with a clear and definite x-ray picture there has become a tendency for this complaint to be ignored as a clinical entity Hence the main burden of looking after these unfortunate patients has fallen on the shoulders of the General Practitioners, especially during the winter months when they also fill the general medical beds in the local general hospitals, suffering from their annual bout of acute bronchiolitis and later on in years from right heart failure The Council of the N. A. P. T. has wisely decided to amend its terms of reference so as to include chronic bronchitis as follows:- 24 "Subject to the needs of these patients and their families being reasonably satisfied, the Committee shall be empowered to extend its care work to assist patients with non-tuberculous disease of the chest, and diseases of the heart." This realistic policy should provide a lead to all those interested clinically and socially in the health and welfare of those patients disabled by chronic bronchitis. Now that tuberculosis of the lung is coming under control, it is essential that the unused tuberculosis beds should not be arbitrarily closed, but should be used to deal more effectively with this further problem of chronic pulmonary disability.

WYMAN PHYSICIAN SUPERINTENDENT FULHAM HOSPITAL The welfare of our old people is causing great concern to the community today, Inflation affects the retired and pensioned more than the younger working population, and illness brings in its train social consequences to the old which often transcend in importance its physical effects. In the last few years such problems have been increasingly prominent in the work of the Medical Officer of Health, Divisional Medical Officer, L. C. C ., the General Practitioner and the Hospital Physician Reasons for this are not hard to seek Though the population of the Borough has been decreasing, the proportion of people over the age of 65 has increased. Population Males Age 65 Females Age 65 1931 151,200 4,403 (2.9%) 6,842 (4,5%) 1951 122,400 5,500 (4.49%) 8,500 (6.94%) The young women of the household, even if married, go out to work to a much greater extent than in the past so that there may be nobody at home all day to look after an elderly relative. Again the younger members of the family tend to leave the Borough for new housing estates or new towns while the older remain behind without relatives near at hand to help them in their days of distress. What leads to the actual breakdown so that an independent old man or woman needs help from the community, and what help can be given? The loss of independence may come gradually and insidiously with declining physical and mental powers. For a time, the stronger partner, in the case of a married couple, may be able to take over all the household duties, the washing the cleaning and the shopping, but eventually the burden may become insupportable. Or more suddenly, the illness or death of one partner leaves the survivor deprived of help and unable to manage alone. A single person may be helped by kindly friends or neighbours, but there comes a time when this is insufficient or the friend herself becomes ill or has to go on holiday or for some other reason has to withdraw the aid offered. Difficulties may arise after recovery from apparently acute illnesses. After an attack of pneumonia or heart trouble, an old person may find the range of his activity limited. A stroke may leave so much disability that an independent existence becomes impossible. What help can be given? As far as possible, an attempt is made to keep the patient in his own home where among familiar surroundings and in the neighbourhood of friends and relatives free from the restrictions of an institution, he should be at his happiest. If this is impossible, the next choice would be a small home either private or run by the various organisations. The Borough for example has a small home on Putney Hill. Application may be made for L. C. C, Part III accommodation. For these homes, people have to be in relatively good health, ambulant and able to look after themselves, although of course, cooking, cleaning and shopping are done for them. If an old person has some chronic sickness and needs nursing and medical attention then admission to hospital may become inevitable. Fulham Hospital has only 87 beds for the chronic sick and has to serve part of the Borough of Hammersmith. These beds are always fully occupied so that some selection has to be made and the most urgent cases must take priority. When an application is made for a chronic bed, an assessment is made both on medical and social grounds. 27 The physical assessment would be made by the patient's own Doctor supplemented in some cases by investigations carried out in the hospital. The social assessment would be based on information given by relatives to the Lady Almoners of the hospital and reports of visits made by the Council' s Lady Public Health Inspector or workers from the Hospital Personal Aid Service for the Elderly run by the King Edward Hospital Fund for London, Such reports would take into account the kind of rooms the patient lives in, the toilet facilities, whether much nursing or medical attention is required and what kind of help is available from relatives and neighbours. It may be that little is required beyond arrangement for meals and cleaning. The "Meals on Wheels" Service and the Invalid Kitchen of London Meals Service and Home Helps are valuable in overcoming these difficulties. Some old people do require a minimum of nursing. Much may be done by District Nurses, and the Borough Council run a valuable laundry service for incontinent persons, With such help many people may be looked after satisfactorily in their own homes, Nevertheless when all these factors have been taken into account, a certain number of patients obviously need admission to hospital, and are too difficult to be cared for at home. It should be emphasised here than an old person ill is not necessarily"chronic sick" aand may be acutely ill with pneumonia, heart failure, etc and treated in no way different from a young person with these illnesses in the ordinary acute wards of the hospital In hospital every endeavour is made to get patients up and ambulant. The patient confined to bed runs a greater risk of bed sores, trouble with the bowels and bladder, stiffness of the joints and other mishaps. For this reason every encouragement is given to increase the activity of patients as much as possible. Physiotherapy helps to re-educate people in walking and using their hands. Chiropody and Occupational therapy are valuable adjuncts. We are sometimes pleasantly surprised to find patients who have been bedridden and apathetic in their own home, become ambulant and alert when encouraged to get up. Incontinence too may improve. On the other hand, occasionally, the transfer to unfamiliar surroundings exerts a harmful effect and a patient may succumb very shortly after removal to hospital. Even though walking may be severely restricted, many aged people enjoy a chair existence knitting reading, looking at television and talking to their neighbours. The chronic sick wards differ in their requirements from ordinary wards. There should be less discipline and a freer more home-like atmosphere with day rooms, gardens and all forms of amenities for patients who will spend months or years there, many till the end of their days. While attempts have been made to improve old and out-of-date buildings by redecoration, reflooring and so on, they still fall far short of the ideal. Nevertheless, patients are usually very happy in this sheltered atmosphere and are well cared for by a devoted staff. Vacancies occur infrequently in the chronic wards. To cope with the demand for the few available beds, it is important that patients who can be looked after outside should not be retained in hospital longer than necessary. Patients are constantly reviewed to see whether sufficient improvement has taken place for them to return to their own home or be looked after in Homes for Old People. The latter are usually full and vacancies rare, so that circulation is very slow. Private Nursing Homes can accommodate some elderly people who can afford the necessary fees. The lack of facilities and the difficulties in helping many of the chronic sick for whom application is made is a source of great concern, but the problem is too large to be regarded as a medical one alone. When it is realised that in 20 years time one in 5 of the population will be 65 years of age or over, it is obvious that difficulties will increase rather than diminish and that the problem is a social one that needs a greater integration of all social services to solve it than exists at present The last decade has witnessed a greater understanding of and interest in the needs and difficulties of the older members of the community, but a lot remains to be done to bring our chronic sick hospitals and departments up-to-date and more in accord with the hopes and aspirations of the present day. 28 AGE PROPORTION OF POPULATION OF ENGLAND AND WALES, 1841, 1901, 1951 AND 1971 (ESTIMATED) As the proportion of elderly persons in the population increases so must the demand for the services available to them. The need for new services too will arise. The following diagrams illustrate the ageing of the population in England and Wales. 29 EXTRACTS FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FULHAM OLD PEOPLES WELFARE COMMITTEE I AM INDEBTED TO THE SECRETARY MR. C. F. THATCHER, LL. B., FOR THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION "Meals on Wheels" In July 1956 we were advised by the wandsworth Old People' s Welfare Committee that principally due to transport difficulties they had decided to withdraw from the scheme in which they and the Fulham Old People's Welfare Committee obtained meals from the South London Catering Company for "Meals on Wheels" and luncheon clubs, and to obtain meals from another source. Under the scheme existing at the time the caterers were guaranteed a figure of 700 meals a week for the two Committees and it was obvious that without the assistance of Wandsworth, Fulham alone could no longer guarantee this figure. Consulta tion took place with the caterers who agreed to enter into a new arrangement with us for a guaranteed figure of 300 meals a week if the price was raised from 1s. 7d. to 1s. 9d. per meal Such an arrangement was entered into in September 1956 and about the same time the London County Council agreed to increase its subsidy by an extra 2d. per meal for all meals supplied under the scheme so that in effect no increase became payable either by the pensioners or by the Committee. The charge of 1s. 9d. is made up as follows:- Grant from the London County Council 10d. Payable by pensioners 10d. Charge for washing utensils etc (payable by Committee) 1d. ls. 9d. By virtue of the increased price the caterer was able to improve the quality of the meals supplied. The number has increased and at present averages 350 a week - well above the guaranteed figure. We were very pleased to receive a grant of £43 from the past Mayor (Councillor F. Desborough, J. P. ) towards the cost of a new type of meal container for the meals service which, when installed, will enable the meals to be kept hot whilst in transit by means of charcoal burners. In order to accommodate the new containers the internal construction of the van has to be modified and the Borough Surveyor has been asked to deal with this. The cost of the containers, excluding the modifications required to the van, is approximately £100. Whilst the initial expenditure may be regarded as rather high it is nevertheless felt to be justified inasmuch as the new containers will render the meals much more attractive at the time the food is served Special thanks are due to the W. V. S. who provide voluntary helpers to carry out this important service on five days a week throughout the year. Invalid Meals for London This organisation continues to provide an essential service in the regular delivery of meals to housebound pensioners needing invalid diets. The service is not exclusively for the elderly but pensioners form the largest proportion of recipients. Since the service was started the Council through the Fulham Old People's Welfare Committee has made annual grants to Invalid Meals for London and for the year 1957-58 the amount contributed will be £800. At present two vans are operated for this service from the Munster Road centre and the number of meals it is possible to deliver each day is limited by the capacity of the two vans, i. e. 94. The demand for invalid meals has grown considerably since the 30 service was started and unfortunately there is now a waiting list. Very urgent cases however, such as patients newly discharged from hospital, are given special consideration Requests are regularly received from hospital almoners and doctors for invalid meals not necessarily because the patients need special diets but because the meals are needed on 5 days a week. The meals supplied by the "meals on wheels" service are of course suitable in many such cases but under the present arrangements the meals can only be supplied on two days a week. To ease the pressure on Invalid Meals for London the only solution appears to be the transfer of cases from Invalid Meals to "Meals on Wheels" but this would necessitate an extension of the "Meals on Wheels" service by deliveries on more days per week than at present The cost to the pensioners of each meal supplied by Invalid Meals was increased from 10d. to 11d. on 3rd December, 1956 The increase would have been greater but for the grant made to Invalid Meals by the Committee. Chiropody Owing to the increased demand for clinical chiropody the Committee agreed to an increase from 3 to 4 hours for each session of chiropody from 3rd July, 1956. This service is not self supporting and the balance of expenses is met out of grants to the Committee mainly from the Sunday Cinema Entertainments Fund. As will be seen from the following figures the number of treatments has increased but appointments for new cases still have to be made many weeks in advance. Number of Treatments given at Red Cross Society's premises and Bishop Creighton House June 1956 56 July " 63 August " 55 September " 67 October " 79 November " 66 December " 50 For information the chiropody sessions as now provided are set out below:- Bishop Creighton House. Lillie Road, Every Tuesday 1.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. Fulham, S. W. 6. British Red Cross Society, 52, New King's Road, Every Tuesday 9. 0 a.m. to 1. 0 p.m. Fulham, S. W. 6. Luncheon Clubs An additional luncheon club was opened by the W. V. S. at St. James' Church Hall, Moore Park Road, S. W. 6, on 19th March 1957 where meals are served on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays from 12 - 2 p.m. This new club is thriving and serves an average of 19 meals each session There are now three luncheon clubs in existence in the Borough, the other two being the Brunswick Luncheon Club, Haldane Road, (run by the Red Cross) and the Coronation Green Luncheon Club (run by the W. V. S. ) at Cobb's Hall. The luncheon clubs are very Popular with the old people and render a worth while service. Not only do they supply mid-day meals to old people at a price they can afford, but they also help to bring companionship to those who are lonely. 31 Holiday Schemes Holidays during 1956 were organised for the eighth year in succession. The resorts chosen were Broadstairs and Southsea. In May 118 elderly folk went on holiday and in September 103 participated. Christmas Activities In addition to the usual Christmas party for 200 lonely pensioners. arrangements were made for the distribution of 100 gift parcels to elderly housebound and lonely old people just before Christmas. The names were selected from those submitted by 16 local organisations. The Fulham Grocers' Association very kindly provided at a greatly reduced price the Christmas fare which was delivered in attractive carrier bags by members of the 23rd Fulham Boy Scout Group. Assistance in parcelling up was given by members of the Committee. In one way the Christmas party held at the Walham Green Methodist Church Hall on Boxing Day was disappointing There were many more "non-acceptances" than usual due mostly to illness and on the day of the party the wet weather kept many away The 150 old people who did attend however were well rewarded by a first class Christmas dinner cooked by the 127th London Company of the Boys Brigade and an enjoyable concert of musical and humourous items rendered by the Toc H Male Voice Choir The Mayor, as usual, kindly met the expenses of the party, which this year cost £88 out of his Charity Fund, and attended the party with the Mayoress. By arrangement with the South London Catering Company all the recipients of "Meals on Wheels" received a Christmas dinner during Christmas week Entertainment Provided by the Council It is of interest to record that the Borough Council during the winter period provided 12 afternoon concerts. 6 quiz concerts and 2 evening entertainments at the Town Hall Whilst these entertainments are not specially for old people, they are greatly enjoyed by elderly persons who form a large proportion of the audience on each occasion During the summer the Council also provides band concerts and variety entertainments in the parks which again are enjoyed by a large number of elderly persons. Voluntary Visiting The good work of visiting old people in their own homes by clubs and organisations has continued throughout the year. Requests are regularly received from hospitals relatives and other sources for old people living alone to be visited. In the main these are referred to Bishop Creighton House whose 25 visitors perform most valuable work in this field. Home Help Service The officers and members of the Old People'S Welfare Committee co-operate fully with the L. C. C. Home Help Service which provides help in the house where it is needed. There are now 92 women helpers and 2 male helpers on the register and approximately 60% of the cases assisted are elderly persons. The number of elderly people receiving assistance on 30th March was 453. The night help service has recently been extended in the London area and arrangements can be made for a home help to sit with an elderly person in a case where the doctor considers it is essential that the patient should not be left alone. 32 BATHING FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY Public Baths Old people may obtain without charge, a hot bath at the Fulham Baths on Tuesdays and Wednesdays between 10 a.m. and 12 noon, and 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. I am informed by the Baths Superintendent Mr. R. C. Gerred that approximately 30 persons a week take advantage of these facilities. Home Bathing This service was commenced in April. 1954. It has proved immensely popular and not unduly costly. 1955 1956 Number of baths given 1,306 1,812 Number of persons receiving baths 72 87 Number of persons on waiting list at end of year 8 6 Two additional Home Bathing Attendants commenced duty in May and there are now four Attendants (three female and one male) engaged on this work paid on a sessional basis. S.O.S CARD SCHEME The S O.S Card Scheme was started in August, 1953, with the object of getting help quickly to elderly people in emergency. 91 Total cards issued since scheme started Total cards issued during 1956 13 OLD PEOPLE'S LAUNDRY (Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936) Service for Incontinent Persons A scheme under the provisions of this Section to cleanse the linen and bedding of aged, infirm and incontinent persons was commenced in March 1952, and is proving of real benefit to sufferers. The work is carried out at the Disinfecting Station where modern equipment is enabling the staff to deal quickly and efficiently with the work. By arrangement with Chelsea Borough Council the washing of their old people is dealt with at the Station, Chelsea providing the transport and paying a charge of 7d. per 1b. (dry weight). The following 12,811 articles of Fulham residents were cleansed during the year:- Sheets 3,142 Pillow cases 1,503 Towels 2,275 Underwear 3,994 Mattress Covers 141 1,643 "Pieces" Blankets 113 33 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, SECTION 47 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951 Visiting of old people who may come under the above Acts is carried out by the Public Health Department. There were 3 compulsory removals under the Amendment Act during 1956. In each case the Order was made for three weeks, the maximum permissible time under this Act. Details of one of these three cases which is very typical, are as follows:- Mr. E. D. Aged 86 years This case was reported by his doctor who stated that he was senile and, in addition to having chronic bronchitis, he also had a bilateral cataract, although he was not registered as a blind person. He had also become doubly incontinent and was causing a grave nuisance to other occupants in the house where he lived occupying one room. Mr. D. refused to go into a hospital and his daughter who had looked after him for ten years was unable to continue to give him attention His physical condition and the conditions under which he was living were such that he required urgent hospital care and attention He was taken to Fulham Hospital in March and was subsequently transferred in May to an L. C. C. Institution where he died in January 1957 Departmental Records of Old People The details of old persons as they become known are recorded in the Department and the number although fluctuating is on the increase Number of primary visits for investigation in 1956 306 New cases recorded for supervision in 1956 199 Number of deaths recorded in 1956 63 Number of old people admitted to Hospitals, Homes and Institutions permanently 70 Re-visits 892 Total number of cases under supervision at end of year 376 Total number of cases recorded In Department 968 Number of cases referred to other Authorities and Organisations, or miscellaneous 54 Number left District 12 34 Section D Sanitary Circumstances of the Area Page Visits by Public Health Inspectors 35 Summary of Works carried out under Supervision of Public Health Inspectors 35-36 Disinfection, Disinfestation and Laundry Services 36 Legal proceedings 37 Land Charges 37 Works in default 37 Housing Act 1936 - Demolition and Closing Orders 37 Slum Clearance Programme 38 Housing Repairs and Rents Act 1954 38-39 Housing Act 1949 - Improvement Grants 39 Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Acts 1920-1939 39 Habitation Certificates 39 Rehousing of Fulham Residents 39-40 Dwellings completed by Council 40 Drainage of new buildings and reconstruction of drainage 40 Rodent control 41 Atmospheric Pollution 41-42 Factories Act 43-44 35 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA As compared with last year several matters are worthy of mention. A slight easing of the position as regards the Public Health Inspectorate made possible a considerable increase in House-to-House inspection work. In this connection some four thousand visits were paid-quadrupling those found possible in 1955. Rather more cases arose where Court action was required and where the Council found it necessary to have works carried out in default. Generally, however, statutory requests were responded to with reasonable despatch. The drop in housing enquiries from 310 in 1955 to 129 is accounted for mainly by the decision of the London County Council to confine offers of accommodation to tenants who were dispossessed owing to slum clearance action by the County and Borough Councils The rather striking increase in visits made necessary by voluntary drainage work is of interest for, in most cases, the provision of additional and more modern sanitary facilities was involved.

WORKS IN DEFAULT Public Health (London) Act, 1936 During 1956 the Council's contractors carried out works in default at 16 premises, the owners having failed to comply with Statutory Notices served under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. The costs of the work varied in individual cases from £1 17s. 6d. to £142 13s. Od., the total sum involved being £711 13s. 7d.

Borough Council (Bylston Road Area No. 1) Compulsory Order, 1956 Under the above Order, the Fulham Borough Council declared 27 premises in Rylston Road to be a clearance area, and in order to provide a suitable site for redevelopment, declared the intention to acquire 44 premises in Dimsdale Road and 1 premises in Lillie Road. Following a Public Inquiry when objections were heard, the Minister of Housing and Local Government confirmed the above Order with Modification, this modification being the exclusion of the 1 premises in Lillie Road and 24 premises in Dimsdale Road. Slum Clearance Programme 1956-60 During the year steps were taken to implement the Slum Clearance Programme already agreed between the Borough Council andtheLondon County Council for the period 1956-1960:- The Fulham Borough Council (Star Road Clearance Areas Nos. 1 and 2) and the (Star Road Area No. 1) Compulsory Purchase Order, 1956 Under the above Order, the Fulham Borough Council declared 7 premises in Star Road to be clearance areas, and in order to provide a suitable site for redevelopment, declared the intention to acquire 1 premises in Star Road and 5 premises in May Street. Following consideration of written objections, the Minister of Housing and Local Government confirmed the above Order with modification, this modification being the exclusion of 4 premises in May Street from the Order. The Fulham Borough Council (Field Road Area No. 1) Compulsory Purchase Order, 1956 Under the above Order the Fulham Borough Council declared 10 premises in Aviland Street and 16 premises in Chelmsford Street to be a clearance area, and in order to provide a suitable site for redevelopment, declared the intention to acquire 9 premises in Aviland Street, 10 premises in Dewport Street and 8 premises in Field Road, Following a Public Inquiry when objections were heard, the above Order was confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government without modification. HOUSING REPAIRS AND RENTS ACT, 1954 The trend of last year continued and even fewer tenants found it necessary to exercise their rights to apply for Certificates of Disrepair. Once again a standard of "good repair" was maintained at a relatively high level, but no appeals followed the action of the Council in the cases dealt with. Applications for Certificates of Disrepair 51 Certificates of Disrepair issued 42 Applications refused 9 Applications for Revocation Certificates 59 Revocation Certificates issued 47 Applications refused 12 That no action was taken under Sections 11 and 12 to secure fitness for occupation by the number of families accommodated and to prevent overcrowding in houses let in 39 lodgings, is not to say that no cases arose where the need for such action was established„ The Council, like most other local authorities without a housing pool for the purpose, have found that whilst the owners of such premises must be given the alternative of reducing the numbers of occupiers instead of doing the specified works, and are given by the legal means of obtaining possession even of rent controlled premises, the provisions are unworkable except in very prescribed circumstances The provisions set out in these sections must be regarded as retrograde, and completely divorced from realities. Improvement Grants (Housing Act 1949 - Section 20) as amended by section 16 of the Housing Rent and Repairs Act 1954 I am indebted to the Borough Architect and Director of Housing for the following figures:- Number of applications received 7 Number referred to Public Health Department for comment 3 Number of grants approved 5 Despite the many explanatory pamphlets issued by the Ministry, owners of property do not appear to take advantage of grants The chief difficulty appears to be the insistence by the Minister that in cases where conversion into flats is proposed, complete self containing must be achieved. The Borough contains many houses of a type which would be considerably improved by adding the amenities of a fixed bath, additional water-closet, and constant hot water supply, but quite apart from questions of extra cost, complete self-containing is virtually impossible. RENT AND MORTGAGE INTEREST RESTRICTIONS ACTS, 1929-1939 Applications for Certificates of Disrepair 3 Certificates of Disrepair issued 3 Applications refused - Applications for Revocation Certificates 3 Revocation Certificates issued 3 - Applications refused HABITATION CERTIFICATES UNDER SECTION 95(2) OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT. 1936 During the year 163 certificates were issued in respect of newly erected and rebuilt premises in the Borough compared with 59 in 1955. REHOUSING OF FULHAM RESIDENTS During the year 40 families were visited by the Health Inspectors at the request of the London County Council and the Borough Architect and Director of Housing, Fulham Borough Council, in connection with applications for alternative accommodation. Of this number 20 cases applied on the grounds of overcrowding and the remainder on medical grounds and the insanitary condition of their living accommodation. The 20 families found to be living in overcrowded conditions were reported to the Director of Housing, London County Council, recommending them for alternative accommodation on the L. C. C. Housing Estates 40 225 families were known to have been rehoused during the year, compared with 475 in 1955. Details as follows:- By Fulham Borough Council Rehoused from Housing Register 28 " " Redevelopment Areas 103 " " Slum Clearance Areas 10 " " Individual Unfit Houses 6 147 By London County Council Rehoused from Housing Register ) " " Slum Clearance Areas ) 78 78 Total 225 There is close co-operation between the Housing and Public Health Departments on all matters relating to housing.

Since then the experiments have been extended and have been watched with great interest by officers of the Building Research Station of the Department of Scientific Industrial Research and of the London County Council. Enough time has elapsed to give the con sidered view that under strictly prescribed plumbing conditions great success has been achieved. The system has a double merit, first in fulfilling the first principle of drainage namely simplicity, and second the effecting of a considerable saving in costs. It is a source of some pride that Fulham has been so largely the pioneers in such a worthwhile effort. It is understood that the new drainage bylaws under active consideration by the London County Council will set the seal of legality on what for the past few years has had to be regarded as experimental field trials.

Reckitt & Colman. A third station was added in the curtilage of Messrs. Manbre & Garton. The facilities granted by the three managements for siting these instruments is much appreciated. These sites were chosen after consultation with experts from the Fuel Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and being situated in or very near to the largest clusters of solid fuel burning industries in the Borough, the analytical results must be judged accordingly. Making every sort of allowance however the overall figures appear much too high and compare unfavourably with the London average. The somewhat startling variations from month to month sometimes reflect plant breakdowns, but more generally can be attributed to changes in wind directions. The attention of all concerned was drawn in cases where sharp increases took place. Careful investigations were made and managements and technicians showed every desire to co-operate in bringing about improvements. Starting in October a further lead peroxide instrument was installed at Fulham Baths for the sole purpose of providing an efficient check to new apparatus being installed in the near future. 42 ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION DEPOSITED MATTER YEAR 1956 Site Rainfall in inches Insoluble Deposit Soluble Deposit Total Solids Mg. of SO3/Day Collected by 100 sq. c. m. of Batch A.

Noise Nuisances: During the year 9 complaints were received mainly concerning factory noises from old and new fans and water hammer from service pipes. Observations were carried out during normal factory working hours from the street or adjoining houses, and in several cases late evening inspections were necessary. Often in a busy factory, with all machinery running, with "music while you work" radio programmes flooding the workshop a new process or machine is not thought to be any cause for complaint, but outside the factoiy when the noise of street traffic subsides, a new note can be detected by nearby residents. In all cases immediate co-operation was given by the managements, fans were adjusted or curtailed, silencers were introduced on exhaust systems. Residents affected were relieved to get back to normal conditions and readily thanked the managements and the department.

FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1955 Sections 8 and 9 Examination of Food and Seizure of Unsound Food Certain articles of food which are liable to be adulterated are controlled by sampling and chemical analysis by the Public Analyst, but foods which deteriorate in quality and become unfit for human consumption are supervised by inspection and seizure with subsequent condemnation by a Justice of the Peace and destruction. In May 1956, 23 boxes of unfit cherries were seized from a market stall and condemned by a Justice of the Peace. In addition the proprietor voluntarily surrendered a further 27 boxes of cherries from his storage premises. Subsequently at the Petty Sessions the proprietor was fined 20s., with 10s. 6d. costs to the Council, for offering for sale cherries which were unfit for human consumption. Voluntary Surrender of Food In practice, shopkeepers make very little attempt to sell to the public any food stuff which is unfit for human consumption and it is customary for retailers who find food they have purchased from wholesalers to be unsound at the time they receive it or to have become unfit after storage on their premises to notify the local authority, and request an inspection by the district public health inspector who will, if satisfied after examination that the food is unfit, issue a certificate to that effect and arrange for its removal to, and destruction at, the Council' s Refuse Destructor. During 1956, 1, 446 Certificates of Condemnation were issued by the public health inspectors relating to the under-mentioned voluntarily surrendered foods:- Tinned Packeted and Bottled Food 12,870 items Cherries 176 lbs. Sauerkraut 504 lbs. Chicken 41½ lbs. Milk Powder 35 tons, 8½ cwts. Apples 6¼ lbs. Melons 1,336 cases. Chocolate 1 lb. Ham 146½ lbs. Sugar 2.716 lbs. Cheese 9 lbs. Orange Juice 700 galls.

C.'s provided 2 W.C.'s repaired and cleansed 13 Kitchens preparation rooms etc. redecorated 132 Floors renewed or repaired 8 Shops fronts repaired or redecorated 8 New dustbins 47 Counter cases for the protection of food 16 Improvements to ventilation 7 Counter refrigerators 9 Gas stoves repaired or renewed 10 New refrigerators 4 New counters 7 Yards cleaned and repaired 12 Refuse removed 14 First Aid Kits provided 240 Under the provisions of Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, parts of premises used for the preparation of certain specified articles of food must be registered with the local authority. At the end of 1956 there were 84 premises on the Register concerned in the preparation of preserved foods and 254 premises on the Register relating to the manufacture or sale and storage of ice cream, as follows:- Premises registered for the manufacture, storage and sale of ice cream 3 Premises registered for storage and sale of ice cream 251 BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF "CREAM" FILLED CONFECTIONERY During the year 100 samples were taken of cream fillers and submitted for bacteriological examination. The results generally were satisfactory, faecal coli being found in only 8 samples. Of these 8 samples, 5 were from one bakery and after careful investigation of the circumstances, it is pleasing to report that before the end of the year the presence of faecal coli had been eliminated from the samples taken from this bakery. At the beginning of the year, the presence of Staphylococcus Aureus was being found in samples. taken from another bakery and here again following an investigation into the methods of handling and use of the cream, the infection was eliminated. The results may be tabulated as follows:- Free from bacillus coliform 15 Bacillus coliform (non -faecal ) present 65 Staphylococcus Aureus positive 7 Staphylococcus Aureus negative 74 49 REGISTRATION OF PURVEYORS OF MILK During the year one of the two remaining milk bottling plant ceased to function and the firm went over to wholesale and retail distribution of bottled milk. The reason for this change was stated to be an economic one in that complete and large scale modernisa tion of equipment was required if the business were to pay its way. and secondly the extension of the business to such a degree would entail a more responsible staff, a problem with which the firm were already unsuccessfully coping. The arrangement whereby milk was sold from retail shops continued and there were on the register at the end of the year 134 number of premises so engaged. Number of Inspections of milk shops67 Number of Inspections of Dairies78 SALE OF MILK REGULATIONS, 1939 The above Regulations state that where a sample of milk contains less than 3% of milk fat and less than 8.5% of solids not fat, until the contrary is proved the sample shall be deemed to be not genuine. The following table sets out the monthly statement of the number of samples taken, together with the fatty and non-fatty solids contents. Av. F. N.F.S.

Ice Cream must be kept at a temperature of not more than 28° F. and should the temperature rise above 28° F. the ice cream must be subject to further heat treatment and again kept at a temperature not exceeding 28°f. The Methylene blue test is recommended as a guide for ascertaining the bacteriological cleanliness of ice cream, the time taken to decolourise Methylene blue being recorded and the samples graded as follows:- Provisional Grade Time taken to reduce Methylene Blue 4½ hours or more 1 2 2½ to 4 hours 3 ½ to 2 hours 4 Less than ½ hour During 1956. 25 samples of ice cream were examined and graded as follows:- Grade Wr apped Taken from Bulk Total 9 24 1 15 - 2 - - 3 1 1 - 4 - - - 15 10 25 Totals In addition to the above, 15 iced lollies were examined, all of which satisfied Grade I. A sample of water used for the storage of ice-cream servers gave a result of 500 bacteria per cubic centimeter, non-faecal coli being present, but faecal coli absent. THE FOOD STANDARDS (ICE CREAM) ORDER, 1953 This Order lays down the following standards for Ice cream:- Fat 5% Sugar 10% Milk sol ids other than fat 7.5% During 1956, 14 samples of ice cream were purchased for chemical analysis by the Public Analyst all of which were reported to be genuine, a summary of the results being:- Percentage of fat No. of Samples Less than 5% - 5% - 7½% 5 7½% - 10% 3 Over 10% 6 The average fat content of all samples was 8.9 per cent. 51 FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. 1955 On January Ist 1956, the Food and Drugs Act 1955 became effective. The Act was described as "An Act to consolidate the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, the Food and Drugs (Milk, Dairies and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950, and the Food and Drugs Amendment Act, 1954, together with certain other enactments amending and supplementing Part V of the said Act of 1938 in relation to slaughterhouses and knackers' yards. During the year under review, 800 samples of food and drugs purchased by the Sampling Officer were submitted to the Council's Public Analyst for chemical analysis. The samples were taken under the various Acts, Orders and Regulations relating to foodstuffs. The Public Analyst, reported adversely on 31 of the samples examined, representing 3.9% of samples examined. In only one instance were legal proceedings instituted, this being in respect of sample No. 741 a roll and butter, which was roll and margarine. The defendant was fined £1.

No action. 759 Condensed Skimmed Milk Too viscous and colour too dark, possibly due to none-too-fresh condition of milk before condensing No action. FOOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS, 1955 These Regulations came into force on January Ist and contained most important extensions to the law relating to food premises, vehicles, handlers and to the food itself. The Regulations were framed against the background of the rising annual incidence of reported cases of food poisoning or of illnesses ascribed to unsatisfactory food handling. Some of the provisions required structural alterations and additional fittings to be provided, these particular Regulations were effective from July Ist. For the premises affected, this quite often meant the provision of one or more additional sinks and wash hand basins and the extension of hot and cold water supplies. The new Regulations spoke of provisions to prevent the "risk of contamination" of foodstuffs, as opposed to the old "contamination", a most important difference in practice. The constant availability of clean towels, soap and nail brush, the provision of a first aid kit and suitable hanging accommodation for the outer clothing of those employed in food rooms were other requirements which affected hundreds of premises. Food stalls containing 'open food for immediate consumption" were required to have available a supply of hot and cold water and the type of foodstuffs coming within the definition was one problem which locally was interpreted to mean shellfish stalls eel stalls (when food offered on plates, shells etc. for immediate consumption), light refreshments (including coffee), unwrapped sweets, toffee apples, candy floss, soft drinks and unwrapped ice cream. A new accent was laid on cleaner personal habits. The practice of smoking whilst handling open food or whilst in any room containing open food called for the breaking of a habit which with some people was of long standing. The temperature at which certain prepared foods must be kept, and the prohibition of the use of newsprint as an immediate wrapping for open food, made their first appearance in national legislation, whilst the Regulations also dealt with the construction of meat delivery vans and the manner in which meat and offal must be transported. In an effort to assist with the implementation of the Regulations, talks were held with the heads and owners of businesses,and the market traders were also invited to hear how they would be affected. 54 The type of premises to which attention was first given was the cafe and dining room and, whilst some needed little attention, to achieve the new standard, the majority fell short of requirements. In some cases where the business provided only a marginal living, the premises ceased to be used for the sale of food. Gradually the other types of foodshops were measured against the Regulations and by the end of the year a general allround improvement was noticeable, 393 premises having had work carried out. This is approximately one third of the foodshops of all kinds in the Borough and represents the majority of premises at which work will be required. The provisions of the Regulations insofar as they relate to persons however can never be permanently discharged in that food handlers must always be alert to their own daily responsibilities in carrying out the Regulations. The support of the public in helping along the movement to cleaner handling of food was sought by means of a modest clean food publicity effort details of which are to be found on page 64. REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ANALYST-THOMAS McLACHLAN During the year 1956, 800 samples of foods and drugs were examined. Of these 719 were taken formally and 81 informally. The number adulterated or incorrectly labelled was 38. The incidence of such irregularity may be classified as follows:- Number of samples ex amined Number incorrect Milk 180 1 Other Foods 594 35 Drugs 26 2 The number of samples received as a result of complaints increases each year and this year six of these complaints were considered to be justified. Only one sample of milk failed to meet the requirements of the Food and Drugs Act, It contained only 8.47 per cent. of solids-not fat, indicating the presence of 0.35 per cent, of added water according to the Sale of Milk Regulations, but the freezing point showed that 3.1 per cent, of water had been added. Some Condensed Skimmed Milk was received as the result of a complaint that it was discoloured and greenish. Your analyst considered that it was too viscous and the colour was too dark. A sample of Single Cream contained total solid matter 24. 0 per cent., of which only 17.4 per cent. was milk fat. It was, therefore, 3.3 per cent, deficient in fat accord ing to the Fbod Standards (Cream) Order. 1951. A sample of Cheese Spread with Ham and Onions contained 63 8 per cent. of water and 36.6 per cent. of fat calculated on the dry matter. It was therefore reported as containing 41 per cent. excess water and a deficiency of 19 per cent. in fat calculated on the dry matter. The Ministry of Fbod Report FS/REP/17 proposed that cheese spread should not contain more than 48 per cent. of water and not less than 45 per cent. of fat calcu lated on the dry matter. A revised report issued just after our condemnation proposes a minimum butter fat content of 20 per cent. and a maximum moisture content of 60 per cent., on the product as sold. According to the revised report therefore this produce contained 6 per cent. excess water and was 33 per cent. deficient in fat. 55 A loaf contained numerous small pieces of dirt which were probably pieces of carbonized bread from the forming bench. Another loaf contained a red coloured substance, which might have been due to tomato puree, but it could not be definitely identified. Two samples submitted as rolls and butter were found to be spread with margarine instead of butter. A Swiss Bun contained some vegetable fibres which were probably hessian fibres from a sack. A complaint was made that a Gateau possessed an unpleasant flavour. It was decorated with pink icing which contained rancid palm kernel oil, causing the unpleasant taste. The fat extracted was insufficient to carry out a satisfactory chemical analysis, but the free fatty acids were over 1 per cent. A sample of Chocolate Iced Layer Cake received as a complaint was stale on arrival at the laboratory. The fat was very rancid and mould hyphae were present in the flour portion of the cake. It was unfit for consumption. The description "Milk Chocolate Macaroons" for some sugar confectionery the basis of which was really coconut, was considered incorrect. The word "macaroon" without qualification means an almond preparation, essentially a toasted almond preparation. Other sugar confectionery described as "Chocolate Eclairs" had an unpleasant flavour due to the quality of the mineral oil used in order to grease the moulds. A sample of Egg and Milk Toffee had an unpleasant flavour due to the egg powder or liquid egg used in manufacture. During the boiling process this would have been sterilised, so that there was no risk of salmonella bacteria being present. Some confectionery sold as Milky Crunch consisted of 85 per cent. of an inner aerated toffee portion with a thin chocolate type coating, in which your analyst was unable to detect milk solids. Five samples of meat patties were examined. They contained 12%, 13%, 18.5%, 18.5%, and 18.5% of total meat respectively. The filling in a meat patty should not be less than 20%. Some sausage rolls contained only 13.4% of meat, whereas the average of samples submitted by Fulham was over 18.8%, as shown by a later investigation, which was carried out. In conjunction with other public analysts your analyst carried out an investiga tion into the composition of sausage rolls, Fulham kindly provided 10 of the samples and these contained 10.3, 11.7, 12,3, 12.9, 16.8, 17.6, 17.6, 18.0, 19.0, and 21.7 per cent, respectively of Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food "Lean Meat", a method of description suggested for calculating the meat content of sausages. Based on total meat content these figures were 12. 3, 13.3, 15.1, 15.9, 20.6, 21.3, 21.3, 22.8, and 24.6 per cent, respectively. Some Barbecue sausages contained 57 per cent, total meat, with 29 per cent. of fat. Your analyst believes that they should not contain more than 40 per cent. of their meat as fat, whereas this sample contained over 50 per cent., but the Food Standards Committee has now recommended a maximum quantity of 50 per cent. of fat calculated on the meat content. The sausages also contained a red dye which was not disclosed on the label. If ingredients are given on a label the presence of any constituent such as a dye must be disclosed. With sausages the disclosure is unnecessary but if given, it must be complete. A Breakfast Sausage was 20 per cent. deficient in meat as the total meat content was only 38 per cent. instead of 45 per cent. or more of meat. The oil in which some Smoked Saithe was packed contained crystals of stearic acid and the free fatty acids calculated as oleic acid were 43.9 per cent. The product was unfit for consumption. Three samples of Italian Apples contained excessive quantities of lead and arsenic. The lead contents were 5.7, 5.0, and 4.3 parts per million respectively, and the arsenic contents 3.2, 2.9, and 2.1 parts per million. The proposed legal limits are for lead 2 parts per million and for arsenic 1 part per million, but the quantities found in 56 these three samples were not considered toxic and it was agreed that the fruit could be sold if wiped with a damp cloth. A sample of Fruit Syrup, labelled as a pure fruit flavouring, was considered to be incorrect since it was not a flavouring within the meaning of the Labelling of Food Order. Some Gooseberries in Syrup contained 5 parts per million of lead and were low in sugar, containing only 14.5 per cent. The fruit was tolerably good, but rather sour, and could be sold if it was to be mixed with other fruit as in a fruit salad. A Lemonade Powder examined contained tartaric acid, whereas lemonade powder must be prepared with citric acid. Lemonade powder is no longer controlled by the Soft Drinks Order, but was formerly controlled under the Soft Drinks Order, 1946, which stated that a soft drink included flavoured powders or tablets. The label of a Jelly Cream was considered to be unsatisfactory in that the label on the face of the carton should have had the words "milk required" and after the descrip~ tion "Maple and Walnut" there should have been the word "flavour. It was thought that people purchasing this preparation for the first time might believe that it was only necessary to add water. Some Pickled Onions were incorrectly labelled as the ingredients were not listed in their correct order. Another sample of Pickled Onions was flavourless and the interiors of the onions were soft. The acetic acid content was 3.96 per cent., but the salt content was only 0.07 per cent. The onions were sterile, but had been badly pickled. A Vegetable Extract for flavouring soups was incorrectly described as a preparation of pure hydrolysed vegetable protein, although the chief constituent was salt. Some Ground Nutmeg consisted of hard lumps and was therefore, considered to be inferior. The nutmeg had probably been filled into the small canister from a large container in which it had been pressed down hard for a long time, it would be useless for purposes such as for dusting on milk puddings. A product labelled Glycerin, Honey, Lemon contained only 0.05% Oil of Lemon and was incorrectly labelled since the principal active constituents were liquid extract of Ipecacuanha and the Honey of Squill. Food Legislation and recommendations during 1956 On the Ist January the new Food and Drugs Act, 1955, came into operation and it was anticipated that this would bring about many changes in Food and Drug administration generally. but these changes are taking place gradually by a process of evolution rather than revolution. The Act is in itself a Consolidating Act and repeals The Food and Drugs Act, 1938, The Food and Drugs (Milk, Dairies and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950, and The Food and Drugs Amendment Act, 1954, this last Act having been passed with the know ledge that it would never come into force as such, but that it would provide material for consolidation into the present Act. Whether such a procedure was wise or not is doubtful: if the Food and Drugs Act, 1954, had been allowed to operate for a few years before the whole Act was consolidated an opportunity would have been provided to dis cover whether all its provisions were workable. From the public analyst's standpoint there are several weaknesses. The definition of food in Section 135 is not as good as that in the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. With the new Act one finds that a food includes "article and substance used as an ingredient in the preparation of food or drink", but sections 91 and 92 of the Act also provide for "substances" capable of being used in the Preparation of food", and it remains for the High Court to decide what is the difference, if any, between an article or substance used as an ingredient in the preparation of food and a substance capable of being used in the preparation of food. This point could have been resolved quite easily during the course of the Bill through Parliament and, in your analyst's opinion, it should have been settled. Although the first Food and Drugs Act was passed in 1860, there is still no legal definition of a medicine, although the definition of a drug states that it includes medicine for internal 57 or external use. The definition of. a "substance recommended as a medicine" given in the Pharmacy. and Medicines Act, 1941, is unsatisfactory, as it is difficult to know exactly what constitutes an ailment, infirmity, or injury affecting the human body. The new Act states that a food does not include articles or substances used only as drugs, but whilst this may be comprehensive it is far from clear. The Local Authority will now have to be advised by its medical officer of health and public analyst regarding the possible cumulative effect of any substance or substances used as additions to foods. Patent and proprietary medicines are no longer exempt from the provisions of the food and drugs act. A milk dealer who has bought his milk as milk derived from more than one farm and has warranties justifying him in believing that the milk was genuine need not ask for the "appeal to cow" procedure to be put into force but may plead the warranties as a defence. From the public analyst' s point of view one of the chief advantages of the new Act is that a part-time public analyst now enjoys the protection of the local authority, when acting in his capacity as a public analyst. It may not be generally recognized that previously a part-time public analyst has been personally liable to penalties, in the event of a mistake having been made by him either in his analysis or in his recommendations or actions to support his views. One point entirely new to Food and Drug administration is that provision has been made whereby the public analyst for the area, who is unable to carry out an effective analysis of a sample because he lacks the necessary apparatus or knowledge, may pass it to the public analyst for another area who possesses such apparatus and knowledge. Unfortunately expensive physical apparatus is being introduced at such a rate that in the not far distant future it may be impossible to carry out the whole analysis of a sample in one laboratory, but as the Act has been worded the whole analysis must be carried out under the control of one analyst only. From the general administrative angle the length of time during which proceedings may be commenced for samples other than milk has been extended from 28 days to two months and the period during which proceedings for giving a false warranty may be commenced has been increased to twelve months. One point, which is not made clear in the Act and which may cause some confusion, is that the Food and Drugs Amendment Act, 1954, repealed The Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations, 1943. As this Act never came into force as such, but only in the consoli dated Act of 1955, many people have overlooked the repeal of numerous Orders made as a result of this repeal. It would have been useful had the 1955 Act re-enumerated repeals brought about by the Act of 1954. Several Statutory Instruments controlling the composition of foods under the new Food and Drugs Act came into force during the year. The Food Standards (Butter and Margarine) Regulations, 1955, prescribed standards for butter and margarine similar generally to those previously given in the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, by which it was forbidden to sell butter or margarine containing more than 16 per cent, of water, or margarine containing more than 10 per cent. of butter fat. The Mineral Oil in Food (Amendment) Regulations, 1955, permit any chewing compound to contain up to 12.5 per cent. of microcrystalline wax, but public analysts do not approve this order, especially since only a few years ago the Ministry of Food pressed them to endeavour to supress completely the use of paraffin wax in chewing gum. There is no real difference between paraffin wax and microcry stalline wax from the food aspect or that of detection. 58 The Bread (Amendment No. 2) Order, 1956, abolished all price control on bread, and also abolished definitions of national flour,national bread, national brown bread, and national milk bread. The Food Standards (Curry Powder) (Amendment) Regulations, 1956, and the Food Standards (Tomato Ketchup) (Amendment) Regulations, 1956, permit curry powder to contain up to 20 parts per million of lead, and permit tomato ketchup, catsup, sauce or relish to contain up to 20 parts per million of copper instead of 50 parts per million calculated on the dry solids. These small quantities are hardly likely to have an adverse effect on the health of the consumers. During the year the Food Standards Committee of the Ministry issued several Reports:- The Report on processed cheese and cheese spread recommends that processed Cheddar or Cheshire cheese shall contain not more than 42 per cent. of moisture and that the butterfat content of the dry matter shall not be less than 48 per cent. In the case of other processed cheese it is recommended that the moisture shall be not more than 45 per cent. and the butterfat not less than 45 per cent. on the dry matter. For cheese spreads it is recommended that the maximum moisture content shall be 60 per cent, and that the minimum butterfat content of the product as sold shall be not less than 20 per cent. The Report on Sausages recommends that pork sausages shall contain not less than 65 per cent, of meat, whilst sausages made from beef, mutton, bacon, ham, lamb, veal, edible offals, poultry, game, rabbit, hare, and venison shall contain not less than 50 per cent. of meat and that the quantity of fat shall be not more than 50 per cent. of the total meat in any type of sausage. A majority of the Committee recommended that with pork and beef sausages the pork or beef content of the meat portion shall be not less than four fifths of the total meat. A minority thought that the meat should be solely that by which the sausage is named. Your analyst agrees with the minority especially as with both pork and beef the religious susceptibilities of members of the Commonwealth may be grievously offended at the idea of unwittingly eating prohibited meats. It is doubtful whether the Committee even considered this aspect of the matter. Finally a revised Report was issued giving recommendations for limits of the copper contents in foods. The general recommendations are that ready-to-drink beverages should contain not more than 2 parts per million of copper, other beverages 10 parts per million, and that foods generally should contain not more than 20 parts per million. There are, however certain recommended exceptions, which need not be mentioned in this report. It will suffice to mention that some authorities have been pressing to introduce legislation to prohibit the use of any chemicals in food, whose presence cannot be detected. Your analyst feels that the Council will offer him their sympathy should such legislation be enacted. In conclusion it may not be out of place to mention that as chairman of the Standards Committee of the Association of Public Analysts your analyst has had the opportunity to see much behind the scenes and he looks forward to the not far distant future when most matters regarding the composition, description, and advertising of foods will be arranged by friendly negotiation with trade organisations and when the threat of legal action will be a thing of the past except for the few. who think only of themselves. Most manufacturers and caterers are honest and they realise that food administration Protects them from frivolous and even wrongful complaints because after all, the real aim of society, whatever be one's walk in life, is to serve the public interest.

MORTUARY The following cases were dealt with during the year:- Number of post mortems carried out by order of the Coroner 153 Number of convenience cases 89 242 Total 63 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 Section 50 - Burial or Cremation of the Dead 11 Fu6nerals (10 Adults and 1 child) were arranged under the provisions of this Section of the Act Details of the cost of the burials are as follows:- £ d. s. *11 Funerals as per contract 151 4 6 Less amount recovered from estate of deceased, or by gifts, or responsible relatives traced 88 16 0 Balance being cost to Council £ 62 8 6 * The cost of the funerals varies slightly, the average cost of an adult being approximately £14 8s.0d. PUBLIC CONVENIENCES There are seven Public Conveniences, each with a Mens and Womens Section, under the control of the Public Health Department which have been constructed at various times between 1900 and 1939 All the conveniences have both a free and paid wash for the convenience of the public, the only exception being at Wyfold Road, where there is a free wash only These facilities are well used and appreciated Proposal to build a new convenience - Vlandsworth Bridge Area: Several sites were investigated in this area and, finally, it was decided that the yard of Messrs French & Sons (Builders) at the corner of Ismailia and Townmead Roads, was adequate in size and location, although a site on the actual approach to Wandsworth Bridge would have been preferred Messrs French & Sons were agreeable to dispose of their Yard and No 22 Ismailia Road which was also their property, providing that a suitable alternative site could be given to them Fortunately the Council were in a position to offer such a site at Wansdown Place and, with the consent of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government the exchange of sites was negotiated. Although the Ministry gave permission and approved loan sanction to enable this to be done, they did this on the understanding that the erection of the convenience should be deferred for the present However, it is hoped that permission to build the convenience will be granted in the near future Replacement of Gibbs Green Convenience: It is proposed to replace the old underground convenience at Gibbs Green with a modern convenience as soon as possible, and a suitable site near the existing convenience has been found. Negotiations to acquire the site are proceeding but have been complicated because of a road improvement scheme and the redevelopment of Dieppe and Hilmer Streets Area If, however, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government approve the Council's proposals, it is hoped that work in building this new convenience will commence before the end of 1957. 64 MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS During the year 99 medical examinations were carried out. These included the examination of new entrants to the Council's service, to determine their suitability for acceptance under the Superannuation Scheme and of others referred because of sick leave or accident. The latter usually required specialist investigation and resulted in quite a considerable amount of correspondence with private doctors and hospital specialists. By special request two local residents were examined for superannuation purposes on their appointment to other Borough Councils some distance away. In such cases it is the practice for Councils to help each other in this way on a reciprocal basis. HEALTH EDUCATION Miat has now become a familiar and routine pattern of film shows, talks and discussion groups were given to the public and organisations in the Borough as follows:- Discussion Groups Given with the aid of sound film strips produced by the Central Council of Health Education on a variety of present day problems 3 Discussion Groups were held, total of persons attending 88 - average attendance 29. Talks: Given by various members of the Department, usually on some particular aspect of the Department'work. Nine talks were given, total of persons attending 286 - average attendance 23 Film Shows: Eleven of these were given at the Central Library and three at Church Halls. Four of the Library shows were for Adults Only and were accompanied by talks on Atmospheric Pollution, Home Safety and Clean Food (two). The total of persons attending at the eleven Library shows was 1, 220 average attendance 113 The audiences at the three shows held at church Halls showed a marked decrease on previous years (total of persons attending 169 - average attendance 56) and as it is considered the minimum number to form an audience for this type of show should be 100, so as to justify the expense and difficulties in organising them, these shows have been discontinued temporarily. Clean Food Campaign The highlight of the year was a six months "CLEAN FOOD CAMPAIGN" authorised by the Public Health Committee in September and commenced on the Ist October. Although the campaign ended in March, 1957, it is convenient to deal with the whole of the campaign in this report, 65 It was felt that the advent of the new Pood Hygiene Regulations made under the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, provided an excellent opportunity to further the Council's constant endeavours to make both food handlers and the general public "clean food conscious". The activities pursued were as follows:- The slogan "Lend us a Hand" and symbol "Hands being Scrubbed" were combined to form a badge which was reproduced on all the Council's envelopes, literature and posters. Display cards with the slogan and symbol were also designed for use with window displays. Press Publicity: To obtain this a meeting was held with reporters from the local papers to explain how and why it was intended to run the campaign Posters: Double Crown two colour Posters bearing a different message were issued every two weeks and displayed at shops, Council sites, schools and premises of local organisations etc. Window Displays: Were used - one large and two small. The large one consisted of three pegboard panels on which were mounted Clean Food Cut-Out exhibits. This display was circulated between premises where there was room to show the display to advantage. The smaller displays were on show at shops. Literature: The following was purchased and used throughout the campaign:- 5,000 Shop Quiz (Leaflets) 5, 000 Cafe Quiz (Leaflets) 4,000 Sticker Stamps - used on Public Health Department's outgoing correspondence. 1,000 Germometer Cards-issued as Bookmark Cards by the Public Libraries. Schools: Following a meeting with the local Schools Headmasters , Committee, permission was given to circularise all Fulham Schools and invite them to apply for campaign material (literature, films film strips) and speakers. Nine schools took advantage of this offer and two of them had a series of talks and films Talks: In addition to those given at schools Talks were also given to the general public, Two of these were at Adults Only film shows at the Central Library. Films: *The following were shown in conjunction with the campaign:- "Control of Bacteria in Food" "Everybody s Business" "Keep it Clean" "A Fly about the House" "Another Case of Food Poisoning" 66 A Clean Food Booklet - "Towards Clean Food" was produced in association with a commercial advertising firm, consisting of 24 pages octavo size. A crossword competition with a prize for the correct solution was included and competitors were also asked to submit a Clean Food slogan. The winning solution had as its slogan "Be Wise Banish Flies". 3,500 copies of the booklet were supplied and distribution of these commenced in February. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT, 1933 - THE POISON RULES PHARMACY AND MEDICINES ACT, 1941 The retail sale of poisonous substances by shopkeepers who are not registered pharmacists is controlled by the Acts and rules made thereunder. The Poisons List, which has been prepared by the Poisons Board and confirmed by the Home Secretary, prescribes two Lists of Poisons - Part I and Part 11. The sale of poisons included in Part I is restricted to registered pharmacists whilst those included in Part II may be sold to the general public not only by registered pharmacists, but also (subject to certain conditions) by ordinary traders whose names are entered on a List of Persons entitled to sell such poisons, kept by the Local Authority. The Acts and Rules lay down certain requirements regarding type of container, labelling, storage, transport and sale of poisons, penalties being prescribed for noncompliance, Fees are payable to the local authority by persons whose names are entered on the List. At the end of 1956 there were 156 names on the Council's List and the following changes took place in the Register during the year:- Number of listed sellers on Council's register at 1.1. 56 147 Number added during the year 12 159 Number who transferred their business or discontinued the sale of poisons 3 Number on register at 31.12.56 156 69 Visits of inspection were made during the year under review. 67 PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act, which came into operation on Ist April, 1952, regulates the sale of pet animals and empowers a local authority (in London a Metropolitan Borough) to grant licences to keep a pet shop on payment of a fee not exceeding ten shillings. During 1956, 11 licences were renewed and four new licences issued, appropriate conditions being applied to each. No contraventions of the Act were found during 73 routine inspections RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 Under this Act it is unlawful in the course of business to use filling materials to which the Act applies in any form of upholstery, the stuffing or lining of toys, baby carriages or of articles of such other kinds as may be prescribed except on premises registered by a local authority (in London a Metropolitan Borough Council) Seven premises are registered in Fulham. During 1956 the following samples of filling materials were purchased by the Sampling Officer and submitted to the Prescribed Analyst for the purpose of the Act:- Feathers 2 Horse Hair 1 Rag Flock 8 Coir fibre 2 Kapok 3 Hair and Fibre mixture 3 "Millpuff" 2 Algerian Fibre 3 24 With one exception all samples of filling materials submitted for examination were reported to be satisfactory. In this instance, a sample of Algerian Fibre failed to meet the requirements of the Act in respect of the Insoluble Matter, the permitted maximum being 1.5% whereas the sample in question contained 1.8%. The matter was taken up with the wholesalers from whom the Fulham retailer obtained his supplies and a satisfactory explanation was received.
