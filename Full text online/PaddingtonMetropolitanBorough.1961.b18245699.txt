Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1961. (1) Vital Statistics The Birth Rate, Death Rate and Infant Mortality Rate show little variation from the previous year and may be regarded as satisfactory. It is tragic to record that the illegitimate live births per cent of total live births in Paddington remains very high, viz. 21 per cent (cf. 22 per cent for the previous year). (2) Infectious Disease In February a Paddington girl aged 6^ years died from diphtheria. This was the first death from diphtheria in the Borough since 1946, and indeed the last case which occurred in the Borough was in 1951. The staff of this department, in consultation and collaboration with the Divisional staff of the London County Council, discovered ten diphtheria carriers, all of whom were removed to hospital and successfully treated. This child had unfortunately not been immunised against diphtheria, and the opportunity was taken of impressing once again all parents with the necessity of having their children immunised. Three cases of typhoid fever were notified during the year. In each case the infection had occurred abroad, and in two of these cases prolonged hospital treatment was necessary as the patients remained carriers for long periods. The importance of cases such as these is, of course, only too obvious, particularly as in one instance the patient had previously been associated with the preparation of food. The Ministry of Labour were advised to ensure that this patient would not again be engaged in food. During the year there were 148 notifications of respiratory tuberculosis. The figures in 1960 and 1955 were 137 and 177 respectively. The incidence in males continues to be much higher than in females (cf. 94 and 54). There were 29 cases notified in the age group 15-24 years, 50 cases in the age group 25-44 years, and 45 cases in the age group 45-64 years. Although these figures are much better than those of several years ago, they nevertheless serve to remind us that the problem of tuberculosis is still with us. (3) Staff It is with great regret that I have to record the death in a road accident of the Public Analyst, Mr. C. H. Wordsworth, B.Sc., F.R.I.C. on 1st June, 1961. Mr. Wordsworth had been the Council's Public Analyst since 1949, and throughout the whole of this time had given loyal and valuable service to this Council, and was held in high esteem by all members of the Public Health Department. Mr. J. H. Evan Marshall, M.A. (Cantab.), F.R.I.C., was subsequently appointed Public Analyst for the Borough. Mr. Marshall had been working since 1955 in the Laboratories with Mr. Wordsworth, 4 Unfortunately the Public Health Inspectorate remained below establishment throughout the year with consequential repercussions on the work of the department. Two Public Health Inspectors resigned during the year, including Mr. Marshall who had been with the Council over 30 years. (4) Other Reports I include the reports of the Borough Analyst (Mr. Marshall) and the Borough Welfare Officer (Miss Harrison), and to both I would like to draw the special attention of this Council. (5) Conclusion I would like to express my gratitude for the help and cooperation I have received from the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee, the Chief Officers of the Council, and especially to all the staff of the Public Health Department. I have the honour to be Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H. LESLIE OLDERSHAW. Medical Officer of Health. Public Health Department, 14-15, Park Place Villas, London, W.2. Tel.

PROTECTIVE HELMETS.—During the year shops selling protective helmets were visited and samples of the stocks were inspected to ensure that the helmets had been certified by the British Standards Institute. Section 42 of the Road Traffic Act, 1956, makes it an offence for helmets to be sold which are not of a type prescribed nor authorised under Regulations made by the Minister of Transport. The Motor Cycles (Protective Helmets) Regulations, 1957, prescribe the British Standards for helmets. No infringements of the Act were found. HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS.—There are 94 (90) hairdressers and barbers establishments in the Borough registered under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954.

MORTUARY.—Bodies from Paddington are now taken to the St. Pancras Borough Council mortuary when private arrangements are not made. During the year 265 (285) bodies were taken there and 265 (284) post mortem examinations were carried out. BAKEHOUSES.—The only remaining underground bakehouse in the Borough closed during 1961. At the end of the year there were 11 (12) level bakehouses in operation. COMMON LODGING HOUSES.—There are no Common Lodging Houses in the Borough. FACTORIES.—The Public Health Inspectors made 211 (450) visits to factories during the year. Further details of their work in this connection are given in the annex to this Report. OUTWORKERS.—The Public Health Inspector concerned visits all notified outworkers to ensure that the premises are suitable for the type of work carried out. During the year the inspector made 171 (262) visits and all the premises were found to be satisfactory. Further details will be found in the annex to this Report. MASS X-RAY.—Dr. G. Z. Brett, the Physician-in-Charge of the Mass X-ray Unit, has reported that during 1961 the number of people X-rayed in the Borough was 2,079. There was no case of active tuberculosis ; one case of pulmonary tuberculosis under observation was found. Towards the end of the year the Borough Council staff and employees were offered examination facilities and approximately 480 attended, 18 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Offence Result of Hearing Fine Costs 41, Warrington Crescent— Insufficient dustbins £5 £3 3s. 3, Southam Street— Nuisance—general defects — £2 2s.

Family Welfare Association 100 0 0 Paddington Old People's Welfare Committee 1,415 0 0 W.V.S. (for meals-on-wheels service) 480 0 0 Salvation Army (for meals-on-wheels service) 50 0 0 Kensington and Paddington Family Service Unit 200 0 0 Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents 25 4 0 Central Council for Health Education 16 0 0 Noise Abatement Society 5 5 0 British Standards Institute 10 10 0 SEWAGE.—The Minister of Health has requested that this Report should indicate whether the arrangements for sewerage and sewage disposal in the district are reasonably adequate. I have consulted the Borough Engineer & Surveyor and he informs me that the County Council sewers crossing the Borough do become surcharged on occasions, and under these conditions are unable to accept the discharge from the Borough Council sewers. This problem, of course, also affects other Boroughs and the County Council are supplied with full details to assist them in dealing with the problem. The disposal of sewage is a matter for which the London County Council are responsible. The sewage from Paddington goes to the Northern Outfall Works at Beckton. At these works the sewage is treated and separated into effluent sufficiently pure to be discharged into the Thames, and sludge which is disposed of at sea. FOOD SUPERVISION Unsound food.—Approximately 10 (7) tons of diseased or unsound food was seized or surrendered for destruction. Diseased meat is incinerated, and other condemned food disposed of through the normal refuse channels. Registrations.—The following registrations were in force at the end of the year under the Milk and Dairies Regulations or the Food and Drugs Act. Distributors of milk 141 (136) Dairies — (1) Ice-cream premises 211 (224) Food premises 57 (61) Food shops.—Following are the details of the food shops in the Borough at the end of the year:— Bakers and cake shops 34 (37) Butchers 56 (58) Confectioners 127 (136) Chemists 41 (41) Fishmongers 14 (17) 21 Fried fish shops 13 (13) Grocers 42 (41) General shops 27 (26) Provision stores 114(119) Domestic stores 19 (20) Corn chandlers 3 (3) Greengrocers and fruiterers 76 (77) Public Houses 99 (101) Cider Houses 1 (1) Off licences 55 (55) Restaurants and cafes 138 (139) Milk Licences.—The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations 1960, insofar as they related to Dealers' Licences came into force on the 1st January 1961. The Regulations had the effect of replacing the existing Dealers' Principal Licences with Dealer's (Pre-packed Milk) Licences and discontinuing the Dealers' Supplementary Licences. The new licences are valid for five years instead of one year as previously. During 1961 the Independent Milk Supply dairy was closed and at the end of the year the only licences in force in the Borough were those for pre-packed milk. The numbers were:— Tuberculin Tested 115 (100) Pasteurised 131 (121) Sterilised 127 (130) The numbers in brackets are for the comparable licences in force at the end of 1960. Canteens.—There are approximately 30 canteens of various sizes in the Borough. Wholesale food stores.—There are 17 (16) wholesale food stores in the Borough. Food factories.—There are 7 (9) food factories in the Borough including 2 (2) ice cream factories. Sampling.—During the year 500 (600) samples were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination. Prosecutions in respect of samples are reported under " Legal Proceedings." The report of the Public Analyst will be found as an appendix. Inspections.—During the year 1,567 (1,342) visits were paid to restaurants and cafes and 2,451 (1,786) visits to other food shops. Bacteriological examinations.—Twenty-four ice cream samples were graded as follows:— Grade 1 23 Grade 2 — Grade 3 — Grade 4 1 Fifty-eight (89) samples of milk were examined and all conformed to the standards required by the Milk Regulations. Street Traders.—The Council have licenced 7 (7) coffee stalls, 21 (21) fruit and vegetable stalls and 2 (2) ice-cream stalls. 11 RODENT CONTROL.—The following table gives details of the work carried out under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, during the year:— Dwelling Houses All other property Total Number of properties in district 31,487 (31,451) 7,264 (7,307) 38,751 (38,758) N umber of properties inspected as a result of— (a) Notification 470 (403) 94 (110) 564 (513) (b) Survey 130 (123) - (1) 130 (124) (c) Otherwise - (-) - (-) - (-) Total inspections and reinspections 3,718 (3,204) 829 (993) 4,547 (4,197) Number of properties found to be infested by— (a) Rats- Major infestation - (-) - (-) - (-) Minor infestation 187 (172) 29 (33) 216 (205) (b) Mice— Major infestation - (-) - (-) - (-) Minor infestation 278 (260) 63 (74) 341 (334) Number of infested properties treated by the Council 459 (424) 90 (106) 549 (530) Total treatments and re-treatments 489 (476) 103 (120) 592 (596) It was not found necessary to serve any notices under the Act. Two block control schemes were carried out and the sewers in the Borough were treated twice during the year. In December the Council decided that, as from the 1st January, 1962, the charge for the service given by the Council under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 1949 should be increased from 7s. 6d. to 10s. 0d. per man hour. 23 CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 Measurement of atmospheric pollution.—The results obtained from the recording apparatus at the Welfare Centre, 283a, Harrow Road, during 1961 are given below. Month Rainfall in mms. Insoluble deposits in tons per square mile Soluble deposits in tons per square mile S.O, in mgs. per day per 100 square cms.

Confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and in operation from the 31st October, 1959. Lancaster Gate East Order. Confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and in operation from the 1st November, 1960. Lancaster Gate West Order. Order made but two objections from private individuals received. Inquiry held by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and Order subsequently confirmed with an operation date 1st August, 1962. Westbourne Ward No. 1 Order. Preliminary survey being carried out. 24 The Council's programme (formulated in 1959) envisaged that the whole Borough would be a smokeless zone by 1968. The delay caused by formal Inquiries before the confirmation of Orders whenever objections are made, irrespective of the number of objectors, will however extend this target date. Installation of furnaces.—The following figures relate to industrial furnaces, or domestic furnaces with a capacity of 55,000 or more B.T.Us. per hour, which must be notified under the Clean Air Act. No. of notifications under Sec. 3 (3) of intention to instal a furnace 21 (26) No. of applications under Sec. 3 (2) for prior approval of the proposals 8 (4) No. of applications under Sec 3 (2) approved by the Council 8 (4) NOISE.— The Noise Abatement Act, 1960 came into force on the 27th November, 1960 and as it has now been in operation for a year I would make the following observations on its application in Paddington. One notice has been served concerning the noise from a dance band in a local hall and legal proceedings were taken for noncompliance with this notice. An Abatement Order (subsequently complied with) was obtained and two guineas costs given. In ten other cases noises about which complaints had been received were abated after a visit by the Public Health Inspector. The sources of these noises are of interest. Two were from the playing of records in a private house and one from a broadcast by a music shop, four were in connection with workplaces, one from work on a building site, and one each from the shovelling of coke for the furnace of a block of flats and from a neighbour's cockerels. Complaints were also received about noisy parties held by immigrants but these referred to one night only and not to any continuing nuisance. Such complaints are referred to the Welfare Officer, Miss Harrison. Before the publicity given by the passing of the Noise Abatement Act, complaints about noise were rare. Noise was accepted to a large degree as an unavoidable product of the progress of our civilisation. It may be that the Act will not contribute much directly to the overall reduction of noise, as its practical application must be to isolated sources as the need arises. The Act could however be the beginning of a change of attitude towards noise generally. Must aircraft be noisier as they get bigger? Can pneumatic drills not be made less nerve-racking? Surely car doors could be made so that they need not be banged when shut! This last item is not unimportant. It is always quoted as a source of annoyance when late-night clubs are established in residential areas. Above all, in this age of flat-dwellers, far more should automatically be done to soundproof rooms in new buildings and converted houses. 25 The Noise Abatement Society is doing excellent unofficial work to encourage this new attitude, and the positive good that quiet can do is admitted by the Minister of Health's efforts to reduce noise in hospitals. Legislation may go some way towards a satisfactory solution of the dangers of noise but public awareness is the vital requirement. In addition to the Noise Abatement Act the Council referred such of the Council's Byelaws for the Good Rule and Government of the Borough as relate to noise viz.: (1) Shouting and making noise in streets (2) Noisy hawking (3) Music near public buildings (4) Music near hospitals (13) Wireless loudspeakers, gramophones, etc. to the Public Health Committee. CARE OF THE AGED. General.—At the end of the year there were 401 (314) names on the register of old people who are visited regularly. In addition 79 (57) other elderly people were visited but not put on the register as regular visiting was unnecessary. The two Visitors made 3,663 (2,644) visits and the Public Health Inspectors 25 (19) visits to old people during the year. Home bathing.—Sixty-eight (36) persons were given 1,665 (694) baths at home during the year. Laundering of Linen.—The number of cases being dealt with at the end of the year by the laundry service was 20 (21). Fifty-nine (38) people received help from the service during the year. National Assistance Acts.—It was found necessary to apply to the Court for the compulsory removal to hospital of one person during the year. She was a widow and although aged only 60 years suffered from a grave chronic disease and was physically incapacitated. She was living in very insanitary conditions and had no one to look after her. She died in hospital three weeks after being admitted. Holiday Home.—The following guests were accommodated at " Kincardine". Guests stay for a fortnight during January, February, March and November and for a week during the remainder of the year. No. of applications received 945 No. of Guests accommodated 597 Applicants refusing holiday offered:— Date offered unacceptable 48 Private reasons 77 Illness 67 Death of applicant, friend or relative 17 Removed from borough subsequent to offer 12 Private holiday taken 10 Too short notice to get ready 6 Obtained employment 1 26 Applicants not offered a holiday:— Removed from borough 6 Died 13 Single rooms not available 9 Dates required not available 1 Applicant not fit 2 Priority not reached 75 Application withdrawn 4 Of the 597 guests accommodated, 166 were having their first holiday at the Home. At Christmas a further sixteen guests were selected from seventy applicants and spent a week at the Home. The number of applications received each year has become fairly stable, at about 950, and the Home can accommodate approximately 600 guests a year (the number varies slightly from year to year depending upon how long the Home must be closed for redecoration and repairs). Many of the first six hundred offers of holidays are of course not accepted, for a variety of reasons, and the vacancies created are then offered to other applicants, and so on until the Home is filled. Administratively this is complicated by late applications from high priority guests (i.e. those who have never been to the Home before) and sudden cancellations. The priority system used in the allocation of holidays is based on the number and dates of previous visits, and this gives newcomers the highest priority. The question is frequently asked " What arc my chances of a holiday this year? " Although there may be individual cases which do not conform, the pattern which has emerged over the last few years, and is fairly consistent, is as follows (a) All new applicants can be accommodated in their first year (if a late application is made it might not of course be possible to offer a date agreeable to the applicant). (b) An applicant who applies for a holiday and has not been in the previous year would almost certainly be offered a visit between May and September but probably not in mid-summer. (c) An applicant who had only one previous visit (that visit being in the previous year) would probably be accommodated if he or she were prepared to go in the spring or autumn. This is the lowest priority in the " one previous visit " group. (d) Applicants with a lower priority than those above would be offered a winter holiday. January is of course the most unpopular month but in order to have a break every year a few "regulars" are prepared to go although the Home cannot always be filled completely then, or in November. MEALS SERVICE.—One of the social services which has developed greatly since the war is the provision of hot mid-day meals for elderly or infirm persons. Apart from the obvious value to those who are housebound, old people living alone also benefit because there is a natural tendency, if they have inconvenient cooking facilities or none at all, for them to neglect themselves and live on " tea and toast." A hot meal on even a few days a week means the difference between an adequate diet and undernourishment. 27 The meals in Paddington are provided by the Women's Voluntary Service whose Organiser (Mrs. E. M.Warren, J.P.) tells me that in 1961 they served 4,210 to the housebound. Patients are recommended by their doctors and receive two meals each week, those in South Paddington on Tuesday and Thursday and those in North Paddington on Wednesday and Friday. The clerical work, equipment and service are provided by the Women's Voluntary Service and the transport by the Borough Council. The meals themselves are prepared by the Kensington Communal Restaurant and cost the recipients 10d. The London County Council through the agency of the Borough Council subsidise the service to the extent of 1s. 0d. a meal. In addition to the meals delivered at home the Women's Voluntary Service started a luncheon club about five years ago for pensioners who are able to attend at the Centre in Praed Street. The meals are collected from the Kensington Communal Restaurant by Borough Council transport and served twice weekly, on Tuesday and Thursday. During 1961 the number of meals served was 1,504, the number being restricted by the space available. Again the charge is lOd. a meal. Major Edwards of the Salvation Army informs me that before they were obliged to leave the Cirencester Street premises, owing to their demolition in connection with the London County Council's Warwick Crescent Development, mid-day meals were provided for about eighty pensioners a week. Some were delivered to invalids and the rest were served at the Club in the Goodwill Centre. The meals were prepared by the Salvation Army and served on four days a week. The charge to the pensioners was 11d. a meal and a subsidy of 11d. was received. At the moment, although a new temporary Centre has been started, the meals service has had to be suspended. It is anticipated however that the service will re-commence towards the end of May. A further service is provided by the Invalid Meals Service. This is a specialised service for invalids which was organised for many years in London by a voluntary association called Invalid Meals for London. It was transferred to the London County Council on the 1st December 1961. The service was introduced into Paddington in September, 1959 to cater for people requiring special meals on account of gastric or duodenal ulcers, diabetes, and other diseases. Suitable meals are also provided for partially-sighted or physically handicapped people, particularly those who live alone and are unable to cater for themselves but who do not need a special diet. Meals are supplied only on a medical recommendation. It is only possible for a limited number of people to receive meals, but the meals are provided on five days a week. Approximately 90 Paddington residents receive this service. The charge for the meals is 2s. 6d., but this is reduced according to the patient's financial circumstances to 1s. 10d. or to a minimum of 1s. 4d. for retirement pensioners or those in receipt of National Assistance. PIGEONS.—Although a few complaints are received each year (six in 1960; eight in 1961) about nuisances from pigeons, Paddington probably suffers less than many other Boroughs. The local pigeon population has been estimated as in the thousands but the proximity of Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, as well as the 28 garden squares in the south of the Borough and the recreation ground in the north, masks the number. The cause of the complaints is invariably the congregating of the birds with the consequent damage of property, noise and unsightly mess. Under Section 121 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 the Council have power to destroy pigeons in order to abate " a nuisance, annoyance or damage " caused by their congregation. No official pigeon catcher has been appointed but if appropriate complainants are referred to two private firms who operate in the Borough. No responsibility for their work is accepted by the Council, the charges and other matters being arranged between the complainant and the firm chosen. Most of the complaints dealt with in this way arise from a natural congregation, for roosting, on tall buildings. The feeding of pigeons by bird-lovers however is another cause of pigeons flocking together and almost always leads to complaints by neighbours about the resultant noise and filth. Jn these cases the Public Health Inspector visits the offender and points out the nuisance caused and that the birds will not starve if left to themselves. This frequently ends the trouble. There is no doubt in my mind that in common with dogs, which foul the streets and frequently cause road accidents when off the lead, pigeons in large numbers are not acceptable in towns, and that only good would come from a reduction in their number. This should be undertaken as a combined operation throughout London to prevent the birds from merely moving on. HOUSING (FINANCIAL PROVISIONS) ACT, 1958 AND HOUSE PURCHASE AND HOUSING ACT, 1959 When applications are made to the Council for either discretionary or standard Improvement Grants the Public Health Department is asked to comment on the scheme submitted. If a grant is made, any works carried out have to be to the satisfaction of this department so far as public health matters are involved, e.g. drainage, underground rooms. During 1961 the department's comments were invited upon 61 applications, but not all of these were proceeded with. The department is also asked to supply information regarding the property (the existence of closing orders; permitted numbers, etc.) before the Council considers applications for loans for house purchase, and 116 such cases were dealt with during the year. BRAITHWAITE PLACE/ADPAR STREET CLEARANCE AREA During the year the Council were able to make a start on the re-housing of families from this clearance area and on demolishing the properties. The main difficulty has been the provision of alternative accommodation. Most of the re-housing has been in the new flats erected in the Hall Park area. By the end of the year 85 families (261 persons) had been rehoused and 17 premises had been demolished. 29 HOUSING ACT 1961.—This Act received the Royal Assent on the 24th October, 1961 and became operative one month later. The main provisions directly affecting the work of the Public Health Department are:— Section 12 Enables a local authority to apply regulations which will be made by the Minister of Housing and Local Government (under section 13 of the Act) to houses in multiple occupation. The object of the regulations is to ensure proper standards of management and in particular will deal with those parts of the premises which are in common use e.g. kitchens, water-closets, staircases and gardens. Section 14 Enables a local authority to serve a notice requiring works in a house to which regulations have been applied. Section 15 Enables a local authority to serve a notice (in relation. to a house in multiple occupation) requiring work if the house does not have " reasonable facilities " for lighting, ventilation, water supply, washing, drainage, waterclosets, food storage preparation and cooking, disposal of waste water, and space heating. The facilities required must have regard to the number of occupiers and the notice may be complied with by reducing the number of occupiers. Section 18 Gives a local authority the power to carry out work in default of compliance with notices served under sections 14 and 15. Section 19 Empowers a local authority to make a "direction" fixing the number of persons who may occupy a house in multiple occupation. Section 22 Empowers a local authority to keep a register of houses let in lodgings, subject to confirmation by the Minister. Section 24 Allows a Clearance Order to be varied (previously an order confirmed by the Minster was irrevocable). Section 26 Allows a Demolition Order to be determined and a Closing Order substituted. The return allowed to the owner of a house let on a controlled tenancy in respect of improvements is increased from 8 per cent. to 12½ per cent. of his expenditure; the provisions of the House Purchase and Housing Act 1959 relating to the standard grant for a hot water supply and a water-closet are amended; and the repairing obligations of the parties to short leases (less than seven years) of dwelling houses are amended. It is too early to comment on the working of the Act but I hope to report further on the practical aspects of the Act in Paddington in my 1962 Report. UNDERGROUND ROOM REGULATIONS.—In June 1959 the Minister of Housing and Local Government issued Circular No. 38/59 which notified Councils that the existing model underground room regulations had been revised and asked that local authorities should review their own regulations in the light of the new model. 30 The Borough Medical Officers 'Committee considered that there should be amendments to the new model regulations as it was felt that in some respects they would mean the lowering of standards already being applied. The Committee also considered that the regulations should be standardised for the whole of London. The Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee approached the Ministry on these lines. The Ministry was not prepared to withdraw the new regulations but expressed his willingness to consent to the making of local Regulations which omitted Regulation 7 (ventilation and lighting of rooms not used as living rooms). The Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee recommended constituent authorities to accept this and to make new Regulations omitting Regulation 7. At its meeting on the 16th November, 1961 the Paddington Borough Council made Regulations on these lines and at the end of the year the revised Regulations were awaiting confirmation by the Minister. WATER SUPPLY.—All drinking water in the Borough is supplied from the Metropolitan Water Board's mains and the Director of Water Examination (E. Windle Taylor, M.A., M.D., D.P.H.) has kindly supplied the following report and figures. The water is derived from the River Thames, stored in the Board's reservoirs in the Thames Valley and filtered and chlorinated at the Board's works at Hampton, Ashford Common and Barn Elms.

PUBLIC SWIMMING BATHS.—Water for the two swimming baths in the Borough is supplied from the Metropolitan Water Boards' mains. Apart from routine tests by the Baths' staff nine samples were taken for bacteriological and chemical analysis by the Public Analyst during the summer months. HOUSING Housing Act, 1957—Overcrowding (a) (1) Number of dwellings overcrowded at the end of the year 152 (167) (2) Number of families dwelling therein 156 (176) (3) Number of persons dwelling therein 703½ (755) (Units) (b) Number of new cases of overcrowding ported during the year 52 (50) (c) (1) Number of cases of overcrowding lieved during the year 67 (56) (2) Number of persons concerned in such cases 292 (250) (Units) (d) Particulars of any cases in which dwelling houses have again become overcrowded after the Local Authority have taken steps for the abatement of overcrowding Nil Nil The number of overcrowded dwellings on the Register of Overcrowding at the end of 1961 was 152 (167). There were 44 (52) basement dwellings on the Register. Of the cases of overcrowding relieved during the year 15 (7) were rehoused by the London County Council, 2 (6) were provided with accommodation by the Borough Council, 31 (27) secured accommodation privately and 19 (15) were relieved by a natural reduction in the size of the family or on obtaining additional accommodation. The practice of sending warning letters to owners against permitting the premises to become again overcrowded has been continued in all known cases where overcrowding has been abated. Section 80 of the Housing Act 1957 gives a local authority power, where they are satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which make it expedient to do so, to allow the temporary use of a house by persons in excess of the permitted number. During the year the Council issued no (1) licences under this section. During the year a total of 216 (275) Paddington families were rehoused by the London County Council and 109 (190) by the Borough Council. 32 Housing Accommodation—Preferential Treatment During the year 150 (206) medical certificates were referred to me by the Borough Director of Housing for " pointing." Points are awarded for certified ill-health, and if the applicant's health is affected by his living conditions the Public Health Department investigates these conditions and in many instances is able to get them remedied. Houses Unfit for Human Habitation No. of basement rooms dealt with by closing orders 114 (200) No. of upper rooms closed 2 (17) No. of mews premises closed 1 (—) No. of houses dealt with by closing orders in lieu of demolition orders 1 (1) No. of houses dealt with by demolition orders or in respect of which undertakings were accepted — (—) Ten (45) persons were displaced as a result of the Council's operations. Closing Orders were determined or undertakings cancelled on 100 (54) basement rooms. Sixty-nine (36) other basement rooms were made fit without recourse to formal proceedings. Of the 114 basement rooms and 2 upper rooms closcd, 23 basement rooms were in premises de-requisitioned by the Council under the Requisitioned Houses and Housing (Amendment) Act 1955. During the time that these rooms were under the Council's control they were considered to be unfit for housing purposes and were not so used. The Closing Orders were made to ensure that the position was maintained. New Accommodation During the year the Council completed ten new flats at Campbell House. RENT ACT, 1957.—Below is a table showing details of the applications during 1961 for certificates of disrepair under this Act together with the action taken thereon. Applications for certificates of disrepair— No. of applications for certificates 7 (17) No. of decisions not to issue certificates 1 (1) No. of decisions to issue certificates— (a) in respect of some but not all defects 4 (9) (b) in respect of all defects 3 (6) No. of undertakings given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule 2 (3) No. of undertakings refused by Council under proviso to paragraph 5 of the First Schedule -(-) No. of certificates issued 6 (12) No. of applications awaiting report at end of year .. - (1) 33 Applications for cancellation of certificates— Applications by landlords for cancellation of certificates 7 (14) Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates 4(10) Decisions by Council to cancel in spite of tenants' objections 1 (1) Certificates cancelled by Council 5 (5) No. of applications awaiting report at end of year - (1) TOWN PLANNING.—Three hundred and forty (355) applications under the Town and Country Planning Acts for the conversion and alteration of premises, change of use or continuation of consent were referred to the Department for examination and comment. LAND CHARGES.—Some 1,837 (2,162) enquiries on matters in connection with the registered statutory charges under the Land Charges Act, 1952 were dealt with by the Department during the year. 34 APPENDIX Report of the Public Analyst (J. H. E. Marshall, M.A. (Cantab.), F.R.I.C.) for the year ended 31st December, 1961. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Paddington. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, During the year under review the number of samples submitted for examination under the Food and Drugs Act, 1955 was 500. Of these twenty-two were irregular and were the subject of special reports. Eleven of them were the results of complaints where the food contained foreign substances. Most of the Food and Drug samples examined were quite satisfactory, and again it may be concluded that the wide variety of articles sampled by your Inspectors and consequently available to the general public, were of good quality. One hundred and eighteen milk samples were examined. A few approached near to the minimum standard below which milk is presumed to be not genuine. One which did fall below this minimum standard was found to be quite satisfactory when subjected to the Hortvet freezing point determination, and it must be regarded as a genuine but abnormal milk. The samples which were unsatisfactory included seven milk bottles which were either dirty themselves or contained dirt in the milk. Bread continues to be an article of food which reveals some surprising treasures, and three samples examined revealed a long piece of string, a nail and a large piece of mauve cardboard. Six samples did not satisfy the requirements of the Labelling of Food Order. A sample of pan lubricant had a label bearing extravagant claims but the labels were later modified and are now satisfactory. A label on a packet of gravy powder was illegible, and this Order requires the various descriptions to be printed legibly. A sample of apple juice declared the presence of vitamin 'C' in a wrong manner. A sample of cooking oil was packed in a vinegar bottle. A sample of prepacked cereals and pulses did not contain a list of the individual ingredients. A sample of chicken broth was also improperly labelled. Other samples which were not satisfactory were a Christmas pudding on which moulds were growing, a can of apricot dumpling which was corroded slightly inside and was under excess pressure, and a canned meat product which was deficient in weight. It can be said that the duties of a Public Analyst who is required to analyse foods, do not include the checking of declared weights, but it is submitted that one of the functions of a Public Analyst is to protect the customer, and the checking of weights is a part of that protection. The last sample which is not satisfactory is a sample of lemonade which contained a trace of disfectant, and at the time of writing, this matter is the subject of Court proceedings. 35 A summary of the samples analysed during the year is given below:— Total Formal Informal Drugs 18 — 18 Meat and Meat products 47 — 47 Milk 118 — 118 Other articles 317 1 316 500 1 499 The year 1961 did not see the introduction of many new regulations concerning the quality of food and drugs, but the whole matter in one aspect or another is always under constant review. The Orders issued dealt with the following matters:— The alcohol content in a wine derived from fermented grape juice need no longer be declared. Certain regulations about poisons have been made. The Lead in Food Regulations fixes a maximum limit for lead in foods. In conclusion 1 would say that 1961 may be regarded as a year which was generally satisfactory. 1 am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. H. E. Marshall, Public Analyst. 36 Report of the Welfare Officer (Miss I. O. D. Harrison, S.S.D.) It is now over two years since I was appointed to assist with the problems arising from or involving newcomers in Paddington, which as I mentioned in last year's report is historically an area that had complex problems long before they were additionally complicated by the recent influx of immigrants. The volume of my work has increased considerably since this report for two main reasons. The first because of the steady stream of people arriving in the Borough, and secondly because my function is becoming even more widely known. The general pattern of the problems to which my attention is drawn remains very much the same, although the emphasis changes from time to time, as most social situations do, because social conditions and attitudes do not remain static. My original contention that new comers should not be made 'special people' is I believe more generally accepted. I still feel that any approach to the problems in the Borough where this principle is not borne in mind would tend to defer assimilation and maintain a barrier of misunderstanding. There are statutory and voluntary social agencies which cater between them for all regular and recognised social problems, and such agencies in our Borough are of course dealing with problems that concern immigrants. Nevertheless, in the social field there are always problems that cannot be neatly slotted into place and this is particularly true where there are the additional complications of lack of understanding, of background differences, misunderstandings and prejudice between parties concerned. The problems which are now more usually being referred to me are those involving newcomers where one or all of these aspects are present. For instance, problems of friction or misunderstanding between neighbours or landlords and tenants, marital and extra marital problems, problems arising among children and young people, and various problems arising from newcomers adapting themselves in a new and completely different environment. The most important aspect of my appointment is to assist in the promotion of harmony and understanding of people who are different in background, in origin and attitude, who come from different parts of the world (not only from the Commonwealth), and who having come together, must learn to live together as members of one community. I think many would agree that Paddington has always tended to be an area with less community atmosphere than many other London districts, which is not surprising because a very large portion of the population over a number of years has been transient. Added to which there is an overwhelming proportion of hotel, flatted and bed-sitter type of accommodation and family houses are in the minority. 37 Nevertheless, community atmosphere did exist in the parts of the Borough where there is a concentration of smaller properties. Although over a number of years these properties have more usually been divided into two or three flats they were generally occupied by families indigenous to the neighbourhood, with the same interests and backgrounds, with certain communal attitudes and who more usually knew each other. More recently community atmosphere in this district is tending to diminish because as soon as a house or a flat in a house becomes vacant it is put up for sale, and more and more of the new owners and occupiers are people who are new to the district. As we know, Paddington is a densely populated area, and yet over the last few years large numbers of newcomers have been attracted to it. There are reasons for this. 1. The type of work which newcomers are largely performing in this country is convenient to Paddington, and because the work so frequently involves shift duties, it is necessary for them to live as close to it as possible. 2. Houses which are so frequently appearing for sale are at a figure which is not out of the reach of working class people, and they are also large enough to lend themselves to multi-occupation, an added attraction to newcomers as it enables them to let off rooms to members of their own families and other people from their own countries who have accommodation problems. 3. Accommodation is probably the greatest problem in London at the present moment, even for indiginants. The problem is much greater for an immigrant who has the additional handicap of being patently different. He is more likely to be accepted in areas where there is more tolerance or indifference, less parochial atmosphere, and where most of the accommodation is of the furnished bedsitter variety. 4. It is natural that strangers to the country will wish to gravitate towards each other—indeed most people prefer to live among people they understand, and whose patterns of behaviour and attitudes are very similar to their own. From the point of view of a Welfare Officer trying to assist with the problem of absorbing newcomers into our society, I feel there are two disturbing aspects of this situation. The first is that these houses will inevitably become almost completely multi-occupied on a temporary bed-sitter basis, which is not conducive to building up a stable community atmosphere, and secondly, because as this type of accommodation is the only type available to immigrants unable to buy property, there must follow a very heavy concentration of newcomers in this particular district. We recognise that towns in all parts of the world have social class areas, but here we have the possibility of finding ourselves with racial areas, and while it is argued that, providing there are equal opportunities this situation is not segregation, it cannot be denied 38 that if different groups of people are to be absorbed into one community and are to be complimentary to each other and benefit from an exchange of respective ideas and cultures, scattering is more desirable. In view of the possible social dangers of allowing the development of racial communities, living in isolation from the rest of the town, I am doing all I can to encourage people within these groups to broaden and extend their interests outside the group, and into the general community. To this end I am constantly encouraging newcomers to want to understand and participate in the wider activities of the city, and in fact to look on themselves not only as citizens of Paddington, but also citizens of London. I feel sure that an immigrant will fit in more quickly and comfortably if he can stop thinking of himself only as a West Indian or Pakistani and begin to think of himself as also belonging to London. This is a two-way traffic problem. Not only do we need to persuade newcomers of their responsibilities outside of their own racial group, but also to persuade indigenous people that they have responsibilities in the opposite direction, outside of their group, because it is only in the realisation of these responsibilities that a complete and balanced community can be built. In conjunction with Officers of appropriate Government Departments, Councils of Social Service and Committees interested in this problem, we are working steadfastly towards the ultimate goal where not only officials and social workers, but also community minded people, who perhaps had not previously been concerned with people with such sharp differences in background are made sufficiently knowledgeable and understanding of these differences as to be able to accept them, despite the fact they may not approve of them, and thus help to resolve problems that arise from misunderstanding. In this connection conferences and discussion groups have been held from time to time, and in the hope of promoting better understanding of people from the West Indies, the Paddington Overseas Students and Workers Committee published a small booklet answering some of the more common questions that are continually being asked about people from this part of the Commonwealth. With a view to stimulating the interest of new comers to the Borough an important conference was recently arranged by the Council and the Migrants Division (West Indies) for Leading West Indians. By this we meant people who had indicated interest in community affairs, or their intention to settle in the Borough. At this meeting His Worship the Mayor welcomed the guests, and the speakers included prominent people in the fields of Local Government, Police Force and Voluntary Welfare Organisations. This was the beginning of what we hope may develop into a programme of mutual social education. It has to be admitted that with the present shortage, housing lends itself to vicious and unscrupulous exploitation and I am 39 naturally constantly devoting my efforts to ensure that the widest publicity is given in an attempt to prevent house purchase without sufficient expert advice. In this the Borough Council have played a most useful part, not only by their supporting the efforts of the Citizens' Advice Bureau, but by sympathetic consideration of applications for mortgages. I have been able to enlist the co-operation of some Personnel and Welfare Officers in industry who have agreed to draw the attention of their workers to the dangers of embarking on house purchase without professional advice. This I hope will be extended. A moment's reflection will suffice to recognise that a conscious effort must be made by every one concerned to achieve assimilation, but by far the greater effort has to be made by the newcomer who has to make considerable adjustments in so many ways before he is wholly accepted into the community. Adjustments even have to be made by a Londoner who goes to live in a small isolated village. On the other hand so much depends on the attitude and enlightenment of the people already established in the Borough. In this respect I would like to pay tribute to the unfailing help of officials of the London County Council, Citizens' Advice Bureau, Hospital Staff, Police Force and of course, members of our own Town Hall and Public Health Staff. I could not terminate this report without again expressing my appreciation of the unfailing courtesy extended to me by Dr. Oldershaw whenever I felt it necessary to consult him. 40 The Ministry of Health has requested that the following figures regarding factories and outworkers should be annexed to the Annual Report.
