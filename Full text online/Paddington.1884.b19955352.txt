4663 ench Paddington METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT. REPORT OF TEE VESTRY, FOR THE YEAR ENDING 25th MARCH, 18 8 5. PADDINGTON. The Parish of Paddington, in the County of Middlesex, extends Northward from the Marble Arch to Kilburn Gate; and Westward from the Marble Arch to Kensington Palace Gardens; it is bounded on the North by Willesden; on the South by St. George's, Hanover Square, and St. Margaret, Westminster; on the East by Marylebone; and on the West by Kensington and St. Luke, Chelsea; its length from North to South being nearly Two Miles, and its superficial extent about 1,280 acres. The Parish is within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Board of Works, to which Board it returns One Member; and its management is vested in Seventy-Two Elected Vestrymen, who meet at the "Vestry Hall, Harrow Road, on the first and third Tuesdays in each month (the third Tuesday in August, and the first Tuesday in September excepted) for the transaction of their ordinary business. For parochial purposes the Parish is divided into Four Wards, the boundaries of which are as follow; viz.:— WARD ONE, All that portion of the Parish which lies within a line drawn along the centre of Harrow Road from the point at which the same intersects the boundary of the said Parish, and thence along the centre of such Road to a point directly opposite the centre of the Road on Westbourne Terrace Bridge, and thence along the centre of such Road and of Westbourne Terrace, to the centre of Bishop's Road, and thence Westward along the centre of Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove to the West boundary of the said Parish at the point where the same intersects the centre of Westbourne Grove, and thence Northward continuously along the said boundary to the point mentioned at the commencement of the foregoing description. 4 WARD TWO. All that portion of the said Parish which lies North of Ward No. 1 and a line drawn from the boundary of such Ward Southward along the centre of Westbourne Terrace to a point directly opposite the W est end of the centre of Craven Road, and thence along the centre of Craven Road and Praed Street, and thence in a direct line to the boundary of the said Parish. WARD THREE. All that portion of the said Parish which lies South of Ward No. 1 and a line drawn from the boundary of such Ward Southward along the centre of Westbourne Terrace, Sussex Gardens, and Westbourne Street, and thence in a direct line to the boundary of the said Parish. WARD FOUR. All that portion of the said Parish which is not comprised within the foregoing descriptions of the other Wards. Under the Reform Bill of 1832, Paddington was united with the adjoining Parishes of St. Marylebone and St. Pancras, such incorporation being called the Borough of Marylebone, and returning Two Members to Parliament. In the year 1870, upon the passing of the Elementary Education Act, the Parish, together with St. Marylebone, St. Pancras, and St. John, Hampstead, were united into a District called the District of Marylebone, for the purposes of the School Board for London, such District returning Seven Members to the Board. There are at present in the Parish 15 Ecclesiastical Districts, viz.:— St. James', St. Saviour's, „ John's, „ Michael and All Angels, „ Mary's, Christ Church, Holy Trinity, St. Mary Magdalene, St. Paul's, „ Peter's, All Saints', „ Stephen's,- St. Matthew's, „ Augustine's. „ Luke's, 5 The Parochial Workhouse is situated in the Harrow Road near the Lock Hospital premises, its management being in the hands of Eighteen Guardians, elected annually, together with the resident Justices of the Peace. The Schools for the Workhouse children are at Ashford, near Staines; Paddington having been united by the Poor Law Board with St. George,Hanover Square,and Fulham, to form a District called the West London School District. The Cemetery for the Parish is at Willesden, and is managed by a Board consisting of Nine Members appointed by the Vestry, such Board meeting at the Vestry Hall on the first Thursday in each month. For Registration purposes, Paddington has been divided by the Registrar-General into the St. Mary's District and the St. John's District. The divisional line of the two districts traverses the centre of the road in Praed Street, from Edgware Road to the Canal Basin, continues thence along the centre of the Canal Basin as far as the Bishop's Road, and passes Westward from thence along the centre of the Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove to the Western boundary of the Parish; the St. Mary's District lying on the North and the St. John's District on the South of such divisional line. For the purpose of providing the Parish with Public Baths and Wash-houses, Commissioners have been appointed by the Vestry, and Baths in the Queen's Road were opened in May, 1874, on the site of premises formerly numbered 143 and 145. The Gas consumed in Paddington is supplied by The Gas Light and Coke Company, and the Water by two Companies, viz.:—the Grand Junction Waterworks Company and the West Middlesex Waterworks Company. The population, as shown by the Census taken in 1881, is as under, viz.:— Ward No. 1 27,921 ,, ,, 2 45,879 „ „ 3 17,918 „ „ 4 15,500 Making a total of 107,218 The number of inhabited houses being 13,231. 6 The Rates levied since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act are as under, viz.: — s. d. £ For the year 1856 2 1 based upon a rateable value of 522,570 1857 2 6 „ 538,879 1858 2 4 „ 582,995 1859 2 7 „ 605,382 1860 3 0 „ 625,479 1861 2 8 „ 643,063 1862 2 8 „ 617,840 1863 2 8½ „ 646,256 1864 3 0 „ 663,172 1865 3 0 „ 685,434 1866 3 2 „ 704,714 1867 3 6 „ 729,838 1868 3 5½ „ 740,686 1869 3 9 „ 759,158 1870 4 0 „ 773,524 Under the Provisions of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1809. 1871 3 4 „ 954,868 1872 3 l½ „ 968,340 1873 3 4½ „ 984,582 1874 3 7½ „ 995,009 1875 3 6 „ 1,004,095 1876 3 6 „ 1,091,656 1877 3 6½ „ 1,098,262 1878 3 7 „ 1,115,550 1879 3 9 „ 1,125,644 1880 3 11½ „ 1,140,100 1881 3 10 „ 1,214,844 1882 3 10 „ 1,234,626 1883 4 0 „ 1,243,708 1884 4 2 „ 1,249,968 There are certain charities under the control of the Vestry, smanaged by Trustees appointed by the Vestry and the Charity Commissioners, and having an annual income of nearly Two Thousand Pounds, which is yearly distributed to the Poor in Coals and Blankets, in Grants to the Parochial National Schools, in apprenticing sons and daughters of poor parishioners, and in Annuities to aged persons resident in the Parish, &c. 7 REPORT.

Surveyor's Department, Vestry Hall, 29th June, 1885. Gentlemen, I beg to submit the following Report of the various works executed, and the general business transacted in this Department during the Year ended 25th March, 1885. Highways. The wood pavements laid in Uxbridge Road at Porchester Gate, in the year 1876, and in Southwick Street, north of Connaught Street in 1878, by two Contracting Companies, have not been repaired by them in a satisfactory manner. Legal proceedings have been taken under the terms of the respective Contracts, but the two Companies are now in liquidation. The third Contracting Company for the wood pavement laid in Westbourne Grove in 1878, has maintained the same in accordance with the terms 16 of the Contract, but in a short time hence I consider another mode of maintenance or reinstatement must be adopted in order to keep the paving in proper condition. It has been necessary to repair certain portions of the wood pavement, laid by the Yestry in Radnor Place, Somer's Place, and Praed Street in 1879, also in Bishop's Road and Eastbourne Terrace in 1880, and the condition thereof is now satisfactory. The footway pavements and water channels have been taken up, relaid, and repaired where necessary in various parts of the parish. The increased number of new streets and consequent increase of traffic over the old ones, render it neccssary to use Granite, in lieu of Gravel, with the aid of two Steam Road Rollers for the proper maintenance of the carriage ways. The powers of the Yestry under the Metropolis Management Acts have still been enforced to complete the paving of certain new streets at the cost of owners of houses and land therein. The public passage across St. Mary's Churchyard from St. Mary's Square to Paddington Green has been widened by removing four brick piers at the two ends thereof, and by setting back the iron railing on the north 17 side. The increased space, and the old portion of the footpath have been newly flagged. The entire cost of this improvement amounts to £188 12s. 3d. Various works were carried out in the disused Burial Ground of St. Mary's, in preparing a concrete foundation for the new iron railing next Manor Place, also in levelling ground, forming and gravelling footpaths, and executing sundry mason's work to some of the footways there. The breaking up of the ground in Grand Junction Road, from Edgware Road to Gloucester Place, by the West Middlesex Water Works Company, for the purpose of laying a large main, 36 inches in diameter, has caused much damage to the footway pavements and roadway, also to the gulley drains, and some of the manholes from the sewer. A short time before the completion of the pipe laying, three fractures in the Company's adjoining main occurred; the water escaping and flowing into the basements of several houses in Kensington Gardens Terrace, and into the stables in Elms Lane Mews, also across the wood pavement in Uxbridge Road, and thence into the Serpentine in Kensington Gardens. The cost of reinstating the works under the control of the Vestry will be charged to the Company. The ordinary trenches opened by Gas and Water Companies, and others, have been reinstated by the 2 18 Vestry's workmen, and the costs thereof, amounting to £1,136 5s. 7d., were paid to the Vestry. The total length of streets maintained at the cost of the Vestry is 46 miles, 3 furlongs, 30 yards. New Sewer Works. In Canterbury Road or Kilburn Lane, west of Ashmore Road, one hundred and twenty-seven feet run of 3 ft. 9 in. by 2 ft. 6 in., one brick sewer has been constructed by the Vestry's Contractor, at a cost of £92 6s. lid. A moiety of this expense has been paid to the Vestry by Mr. Dodds, the owner of Houses fronting this sewer, and into which they are drained. One hundred and twenty feet of sewer of the capacity of 3 ft. 9 in. by 2 ft. 6 in. has been constructed in Mozart Street, west of Bravington Road, by, and at the expense of Mr. Dawkins, for the drainage of houses there. Ready means of access to, and egress from, Brick sewers with head walls, in various Mews in the Parish have been much needed, there being no other means available except by side entrances in distant streets. As these sewers were liable to be flooded during heavy rainfall or sudden storm, thereby endangering the lives of the Vestry's 19 men, when engaged in cleansing the sewers, or in other necessary operations, it became a necessity that this defect should be remedied. To some extent this has been done, as during the year, Fifteen Manhole entrances have been constructed to sewers in the following Mews, viz. :— Albion Mews, West Albion Mews, North Hyde Park Square Mews Chester Mews Brook Mews, North Glo'ster Mews, Gloucester Place Prince's Mews Queen's Mews Bathurst Mews Hyde Park Gardens Mews Charles Mews Clarendon Mews Sussex Mews, East Sussex Mews, West Westbourne Street Mews at a total cost of £252 5s. l0d. Some of the footpaths in the improved portion of the old Churchyard; also the passage way leading from St. Mary's Square to Paddington Green, have been thoroughly re-drained at the cost of the Vestry. 20 The long pending question relative to the control and maintenance of the sewers under the Edgware Road, from Uxbridge Road to the boundary of the Parish of Hampstead, has been finally settled by the Metropolitan Board of Works, who made an Order dated 20th June, 1884, under the 140th section of the Metropolis Management Act, 1862, that the sewers in Edgware Road from Uxbridge Road to the south side of Praed Street, and from a point 100 yards southward of Abercorn Place, at Maida Vale, to the southern boundary of the Parish of Hampstead, shall be under the control of the Vestry of St. Marylebone; and the sewers in the intermediate space between the south side of Praed Street, and a point 100 yards southward of Abercorn Place at Maida Vale shall be under the control of the Vestry of Paddington. Buildings. One large School Building (Elgin Road), 119 Dwelling Houses, also Coach House and Stables have been built during the year. The usual Notices, as required by the 76th section of the 18th and 19th Vic. Cap., 120, together with plans shewing intended method of draining the before mentioned buildings have been received and orders of Vestry, with reference to the drainage in 21 question served upon the Builders, copies of such orders, attached to the said Notices being kept in this Department for reference. Drains. The lineal extent of drains shewn on plans received with the building notices, and necessary for the drainage of the before mentioned new buildings is about 2 miles 23 yards. Nineteen gulley drains, with sandpits, have been constructed for the drainage of surface of new roads taken to by the Vestry, and which in future will be maintained as Parish roads. The cost of these gulleys has been defrayed by the owners of property abutting on such roadways. One hundred and six drains, which were found either broken or otherwise defective, between the public sewer and the respective premises, have been reconstructed at the applicants' cost. These drains, together with various other works, such as repairs to sewers, constructing and re-constructing gulley drains, fixing traps, &c., have been executed at a cost of £1,504 6s. 4d. One thousand and seventy-four pounds nine shillings has been received by the Vestry from 22 persons requiring drainage and other works to be carried out, and such sum is included in the beforementioned amount. The number of complaints received have been 166—such complaints having been made either on account of obstructions in drains that could not be removed by the parties themselves, or from offensive smells arising from air openings over sewers, gulleys and other drains. Attention to these matters was promply given and relief afforded in most cases. With reference to the foregoing complaints, especially as to stoppages in house drains, it has been a great advantage and saving of expense to persons requiring the removal of obstructions when the Vestry's workmen were enabled, by the use of drain rods inserted along the drains from the large brick sewers, to do so; but in the case of drains having outlets into pipe sewers, the only remedy was to open the roadway or footway down to the pipes, at a considerable expense to private persons, and in many instances to the Vestry, in order to clear the drains of obstructions found therein. One hundred and seven examinations from the large brick sewers have been made during the year, with respect to obstructions and other defects in house drains. 23 The usual process of cleansing certain large brick sewers in the Parish has been carried out, and the heavy deposits, amounting to one hundred and twenty-nine cubic yards, have been removed in the ordinary way where necessary. The flushing of the small brick and pipe sewers with water has also been carried out to a larger extent than usual, owing to dry weather experienced during the summer months, thereby keeping them in a sanitary condition. The sewers continue to be benefitted by the constant removal of deposit from the catchpits of gulleys, such deposit being slop, dung, and other debris from the surface of the roadways during rainfall, which would otherwise enter the sewers and be detrimental to the free flow of the sewage. The quantity of deposit thus removed has amounted to 2,506 cubic yards, or 32,366 separate removals from sandpits. Two additional public urinals, each to accomodate five persons, have been erected by the Vestry, viz.: one in Marlborough Street, by Westbourne Park Passage, which is cleansed and flushed with water daily, and one in Westbourne Park Road, opposite Shrewsbury Road, which has a constant 24 supply of water, or dribbling process attached thereto. The other nine public urinals also receive attention daily by one of the Vestry's workmen, in order to keep them in a cleanly condition. Amongst the various additional improvements executed by the Vestry may be enumerated the construction and re-construction of 46 gulley drains, and the repair of 37 others. The expenses incurred in the Highway and Sewer Departments will be found in the Cash Account, printed by order of the Vestry. The Re-naming Streets and Re-numbering Houses.

Report in connection with the several works of Dusting, Watering, Carting Roadway Materials, Smith's Work, and Cleansing the Public Highways, for the year ending Lady-day, 1885. Dusting.—The continued depression in the brickmaking trade together, with other causes mentioned in previous reports, have been the means of considerably reducing the sales of ashes and breeze, and the present outlook appears very gloomy as to any improvement taking place. The miscellaneous materials and quantities thereof, that have been abstracted from 19,354 loads of rough dust collected in the Parish, will be found on pages 17, 22 and 23. The daily average number of loads being 63.66 or 4.61 loads, per horse, per working day. 54 Slopping.—The slop, &c., collected, with few exceptions, has all been brought to the Depot, and after draining in the filtering tanks, loaded into boats, and taken away to Southall, under Contract, by Mr. J. P. Clark, @ 1s. 5d. per ton, also a large proportion of dry sweepings. The total quantity thus sent away amounting to 17,623 tons, employing 5,545 horses and carts in collecting, averaging daily 18 loads, or at the rate of 3.17 loads per horse per day, the maximum number of loads collected in one week being 915, and the minimum 150, giving a daily average of 57.21 loads. A small quantity of slop and sweepings have been shot away at open shoots. Watering.—The season having been very dry necessitated the use of the horses and water vans for a number of days beyond the usual average, they were engaged 164½ days, 4,575½ horses being employed, giving an average of 27.81 horses and vans per day. The quantity of water used for road watering and road making purposes amounted to 31,370,590 gallons, and the amount paid £1,128 10s. 11d., the quantity being ascertained by 51 water meters, one meter being attached to each stand post. 55 Carting Roadway Materials.—During the year 2,419 horses and carts were employed 308 days, giving an average of 7 .85 per day. Horses.—During the year the following losses have occurred, viz. :— No. 6.—A dark brown gelding, purchased in March, 1884, died from hydro-thorax, the result of an acute attack of inflammation of the chest. No. 16.—A dark brown gelding, purchased in March, 1884, died from strangles, complicated with inflammation of the lungs in a severe form. No. 31.—A grey mare, purchased June, 1881, died from twisted gut. No. 41.—A black gelding, purchased in 1876, slaughtered—suffering from an acute attack of tetanus. No. 55.—A black gelding, purchased in 1876, slaughtered—suffering from diseased lungs, and affected with hydro-thorax. No. 18.—Chestnut gelding, purchased in 1879, slaughtered—suffering from tetanus. O O A bay gelding, suffering from fevered feet, was sold in April for <£43 16s. 3d. 56 At the close of the watering season in October five old horses not worth wintering were sold at St. Martin's Lane Repository, realising an average of £8 18s. 0d. The number of horses being 58 to date, and are in good working condition, with the exception of two resting, slightly lame.

Harness.—The general repairs and making of new sets. Smith and Farriers' Work.—For the Works Department all the general smithing work for repairs to carts, water-vans, machinery, buildings, and horseshoeing. For the Highway Department. Pickaxes lined and Steeled. Sharpened. Paving Hammers, lined. Pickaxes. Chisels. Paving Hammers. 421 9,382 961 9 7 and other miscellaneous repairs of tools. &c. Street Cleansing, as described in previous reports, this work is carried out by gangs of men, and whenever practicable by the use of the horse-sweeping and scraping machines, and in some of the principal thoroughfares by the employment of street-orderly boys to collect the horse droppings, depositing the same in bins. 59 In certain states of the weather the surface of the wood paving is thoroughly soaked with water in order to effectually cleanse the same. The accompanying tables and accounts will furnish details and information in connection with the before-mentioned works, and I would draw your attention to the working expenses account A, from which it will be seen that the actual outlay for carrying out the works of dusting, slopping, watering, carting materials, private watering— including depreciation of horses, leasehold properties and erections thereon, erections on freehold land, maintenance of plant and machinery, &c. (these several works being formerly carried out by Contractors), amounts this year to £14,160, being £857 less than last year, and it will be borne in mind that when the Yestry determined to do their own work that the tenders sent in amounted to £13,359, and since that period the Parish has increased in the length of streets by two miles, five furlongs, and forty-six yards, and in assessments over 1,700, a greater part of this increase being in the North Westerly direction, and taking tenders received of late years for this class of work in adjacent parishes as a criterion, there is every reason to suppose that if this work was now executed under contract the cost would be considerably over the tenders received in the year 1876. 60 A.—Account of expenditure and sales, &c., in connection with the works of dusting, slopping, watering roads, carting materials, supply of gravel and hoggin to the Highway Department, repairs and maintenance of water meters, stand posts, and supply of water for road making and watering purposes. B.—Plant Capital Account. C.—Road Sweeping and Cleansing Account. D.—Return showing the weekly totals of the number of horses employed, loads collected and sent away by boats; wages paid; expenses of haulage, tonnage, &c.; and daily record of weather.

SANITARY REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1884. BY JAMES STEVENSON, M.D., Medical Ojficcr of Health. LONDON: McCORQUODALE & CO,, LIMITED, PRINTERS, CARDINGTON STREET, N.W. Paddington. SANITARY REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1884. BY JAMES STEVENSON. M.D, Medical Officer of Health. TENTH ANNUAL REPORT. To the Vestry of the Parish of Paddington. Gentlemen, The registration year 1884 comprised the fiftythree weeks ending 3rd January, 1885. During this period there were registered in the Parish of Paddington 3,007 births and 2,005 deaths. Deducting from the deaths those of 203 non-parishioners, the corrected number of deaths in the Parish during the registration year was 1,802, and the natural increase of population from excess of births over deaths was 1,205, as compared with 1,087 in the previous year. Births. The 3,007 births comprised 1,498 male and 1,509 female children. 2,379 occurred in St. Mary's Sub-district, and 628 in St. John's. The ratio of the sexes of the children born in the Parish during the year was 100 males to 101 females. In London the ratio was 100 males to 96 females. The births were most numerous in the second, and least so in the third quarter of the year. 4 The ratio of births to the entire population of the Parish was 1 to every 37 inhabitants, or 27.2 per 1,000. In St. Mary's Sub-district the ratio of births to population was 1 to every 31 persons living, or 32.3 per 1,000. In St. John's the ratio of births to population was 1 to every 59 persons, or 16.9 per 1,000. Some of the preceding particulars are shown in the subjoined table:— Sub-District. Estimated Population. Births. Ratio of Births to Population. per 1,000. St. John's 37,106 628 1 to 59 16.9 St. Mary's 73,633 2,379 1 to 31 32.3 Paddington 110,739 3,007 1 to 37 27.2 Deaths. Of the total number of deaths in the Parish— 2,005—263 occurred in St. Mary's Hospital, 3 in the Lock Hospital, and 34 in the Children's Hospital, Paddington Green. 175 of the deaths in St. Mary's Hospital, 25 of those in the Children's Hospital, and the 3 deaths in the Lock Hospital, being those of non-parishioners, are not dealt with in this report. Of the remaining 1,802 deaths, 876 were males and 926 females. 1,331 deaths occurred in St. 5 Mary's Sub-district and 471 in St. John's. The deaths in St, Mary's Sub-district include 193 deaths in the Workhouse, of which 97 were males and 96 females. The deaths were most numerous during the fourth, and least so in the third quarter of the year. The following table shows the ratio of deaths to the population together with the death-rate per 1,000 in the Parish and in its two Sub-districts:— Sub-District. Estimated Population. Deaths. Ratio of Deaths to Population. Rate per 1,000. St. John's 37,106 471 1 to 79 12.7 St. Mary's 73,633 1,331 1 to 55 18.1 Paddington 110,739 1,802 1 to 61 16.3 In 1884 the death-rate was, in London, 20.3 per 1,000. „ „ in Edinburgh, 19.7 „ ,, „ in Glasgow, 26.9 „ ,, „ in Dublin, 27.5 ,, ,, „ in England and Wales, 19.6 „ The annual rate of mortality in each one of the five groups of districts into which London is divided is shown as under:— North Districts 19.1 per 1,000. South „ 19.8 „ West „ 19.2 ,, Central „ 23.8 „ East „ 23.0 „ 6 The death-rate in London last year, 20.3, was the lowest on record, the next lowest having been that of the immediately preceding year, 1883, when the rate was 20.44. There has been no rate approaching these since 1850, when the rate was 21.00. In calculating the death-rate in Paddington, no account is taken of the deaths unknown to me of parishioners in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board and in other hospitals in places outside the Parish. Bearing in mind the yearly increase of population (more than 1,000 a year), the subjoined figures, showing the corrected number of deaths from all causes in Paddington during each of the last eight years, may be more intelligible to some than if expressed in the form of a death-rate:— Year. Corrected Number of Deaths. 1877 1,706 1878 1,761 1879 1,939 1880 1,667 1881 1,679 1882 1,766 1883 1,762 1884 1,802 During the year there were 434 deaths of infants under one year, and 648 deaths of childen under 7 five years of age; representing respectively 24.1 and 36.0 per cent. of the total deaths in the Parish. The rate of infantile mortality in Paddington was 144 deaths to 1,000 births. In London the rate was 155; and in the 27 largest provincial towns it ranged from 128, in Portsmouth, to 226, in Leicester. Zymotic Diseases. Small-pox. Small-pox caused no deaths in Paddington. 86 cases were removed to the hospitals—5 to Highgate and 81 to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. In London there were 913 deaths. Measles. In London there were 2,285 deaths from measles, being a rate of 0.56 per 1,000 persons living. In Paddington there were 31 deaths, of which 24 occurred in St. Mary's and 7 in St. John's— being at the rate of 0.28 per 1,000 living. Scarlet Fever. Scarlet fever caused in London 1,444 deaths, giving a rate of 0.35 per 1,000 inhabitants. In Paddington there were 20 deaths—16 in St. Mary's and 4 in St. John's Sub-district. 61 cases were removed to the hospitals—13 to the London Fever Hospital and 48 to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. 8 Diphtheria. 973 deaths occurred from diphtheria in London, equivalent to a rate of 0.24 per 1,000 inhabitants. This rate is identical with that of last year, which was a higher rate than any recorded during the preceding 20 years. In Paddington there were 28 deaths—13 in St. Mary's and 15 in St. John's Subdistrict—equivalent to a rate of 0.26 per 1,000 inhabitants. Whooping Cough. Whooping cough caused in London 3,188 deaths, giving a rate of 0.78 per 1,000 inhabitants. In Paddington there were 48 deaths—42 in St. Mary's and 6 in St. John's—giving a rate of 0.43 per 1,000 inhabitants. Fever. Fever, including typhus, typhoid, and simple continued fever caused in London 1,045 deaths, or a mortality of 0.26 per 1,000 living. In Paddington there were 17 deaths, viz., 16 from typhoid and 1 from,simple continued fever. Diarrhoea. Diarrhoea caused 3,781 deaths in London, equivalent to a death-rate of 0.93 per 1,000 inhabitants. In Paddington there were 69 deaths—65 in St. Mary's and 4 in St. John's—giving a mortality of 9 0.62 per 1,000 inhabitants. Of the 69 deaths, 5 were due to choleraic diarrhœa. Water. During the past year the total average daily volume of water supplied to the inner circle of the metropolis is estimated at 152,273,210 gallons, being 8,000,000 gallons more than in the previous year. The average consumption per head of population was 29.0 gallons per day as compared with 28.4 gallons in the previous year. Of the total volume, about 76,000,000 gallons were taken from the Thames, 65,000,000 from the Lea, and 10,000,000 from deep wells in the chalk. The greatest amount of organic impurity was found in the Thames water, and the least in the deep well water. Of the Thames water, that supplied by the Southwark Company was, as regards organic impurity, the worst, owing probably to the present inadequate storage capacity which it possesses, whilst of the deep well waters that supplied by the Kent Company was the best. The Thames water, however, was of better average quality, as regards organic impurity, during the past year than in any of the previous 16 years, and the Lea water better than in any of the previous 15 years. The temperature of the Thames water supplied by five companies varied from 42.8° in December to 72.5° in August. The temperature of the Lea water 10 supplied by two companies ranged from 43.9° in January to 69.8° in August. The temperature of the deep well water supplied by the Kent Company varied from 53.6° in February and March to 58.8° in June. Thus, even in the hottest months, the agreeable coolness of the deep well water was unimpaired, whilst the river water became unpleasantly warm to the taste. Paddington is supplied with water by the Grand Junction and West Middlesex Companies, which draw their supplies from the Thames. To Dr. Frankland's Annual Report to the Registrar-General I am indebted for the preceding remarks regarding the water of the metropolis. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES STEVENSON, Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Hall, Paddington, June, 1885. 12 TABLE A.
