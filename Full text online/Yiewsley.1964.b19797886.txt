On the whole the district was healthy during the year. There were no major epidemics of infectious diseases, Measles and Whooping Cough being the two chief diseases notified. The principal cause of death was Coronary Thrombosis. This disease and other Cardio-Vascular diseases accounted for over one third of all deaths notified. In presenting my report I feel a certain sadness as it is the last time a Medical Officer's report will be presented to your Council and I would like to record my sincere thanks to yourself, Madam Chairman, and to all members of the Council for their courteousness to me during my time as Medical Officer of Health. 1 also wish to thank Mr. Makin, Chief Public Health Inspector, his Deputy, Mr. Marshall, the other Public Health Inspectors and the clerical staff of the Public Health Department for their help and kindness to me. It has been a very great pleasure to work with such a fine team. In conclusion I wish the new Hillingdon Borough Council, and in particular Dr. Dobson the Medical Officer of Health, every good wish for the future. 6 SECTION A Area in acres 5,276 Total population 1964 (midsummer) (estimated by the Registrar General 24,550 Estimated number of inhabited dwellings 7,342 Rateable Value (31st March, 1964) £3,067,141 Product of the Penny Rate 1964/65 £12,838 12s.

Madam Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is with a feeling of regret that I submit what is my last report to the Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District Council, which will pass out of existence on the 31st March, 1965. The staff of the department have been heavily committed throughout the year on the wide range Environmental Health duties together with work connected with the re-organisation of Local Government in Greater London. During the year the Council's Smoke Control Programme was brought up to date with the coming into operation of Smoke Control Areas Nos. 6 and 12. In conclusion may I thank you, Madam Chairman, the Chairman of the Health Committee, Councillor Rowe, and all the members of the Council for the encouragement, help and consideration the department has received during my 25 years' service with the Authority. It am also grateful for the co-operation received from the members of the staff of the department and from the other Chief Officers of the Council and their staffs. 13 SECTION D WATER SUPPLY Mains water was supplied by Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Company No adverse complaints about the area's water supply were received during the year and a typical bacteriological and chemical examination result is shown for your information. The results refer to water pumped from the West Drayton Pumping Station. Hardness in the water is an inconvenience one has come to accept, but it is nevertheless a financial burden on the Council who are continually defurring Council house plumbing systems due to its effects. There are only 5 houses in the Urban District where the water supply is derived from wells. 14 BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION Location Type Residual Chlorine p.p.m. Colonies per ml 2 days Colonies per ml 3 days Bad. coli (type 1) Probable number per 100 ml Presumptive Coliaerogenes Probable number per 100 ml West Drayton P.S.

(b) Refuse Disposal by "controlled tipping" has been carried out on two sites—viz. Stockley and Moor Lane, Harmondsworth. In addition reclamation of filled land has progressed satisfactorily throughout the year. 16 SUMMARY OF INSPECTIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES GENERAL SANITATION Water supply 42 Drainage 317 Stables and piggeries 31 Offensive trades — Fried fish shops 4 Common lodging houses 1 Tents, vans and sheds 262 Canal boats 1 Factories 251 Workplaces 11 Outworkers 4 Bakehouses 14 Public conveniences 12 Theatres and places of entertainment 6 Licensed premises 32 Refuse collection 28 Refuse disposal 109 Rats and mice 326 Schools 10 Shops 174 Miscellaneous sanitary visits 285 Petroleum 140 Clean air 577 Buffer depot 39 Animal boarding establishments 29 Shops, offices and railway premises 34 HOUSING under P.

The bi-annual treatment of your sewers recently completed showed a decrease in "takes" as compared with previous years. Routine control measures of your tips and the Duke of Northumberland River have been continued. No legal action was required in respect of any reported infestation, another manifestation of public co-operation in this matter.

Smoke Control Area No. 12 comprised the remainder of London Airport in the Urban District not previously covered by a Smoke Control Order. The whole of London Airport in the Council's Urban District is now covered by Smoke Control Orders (i.e. Nos. 3 and 7). Area No. 6 comprised 29 acres and was bounded on the North East by Station Road from its junction with Swan Road. Thence bounded by Swan Road on the North West down to its junction with Church Road and The Green. Bounded on the South by Church Road from Swan Road to Station Road. The classification of properties in the areas are shown hereunder.

These were registered under the Food and Drugs Act 1955 as food manufacturing premises and are modern and hygienic in every respect. Two old canteen kitchens were demolished and all canteen facilities transferred to Central Terminal Area in modern buildings. Routine inspections were carried out during the year and of the millions of meals prepared only one was the suspected cause of food poisoning, involving five people was notified, with no evidence pointing to faulty handling or preparation at the airport. On request the Ministry of Aviation have complied with many requirements to improve the standards of both structures and fittings in food premises.
