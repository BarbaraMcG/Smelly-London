SEWERAGE AND SANITARY WORKS. During the year 11 Sewers have been repaired where necessary, 59 of them have been thoroughly cleansed from standing deposit; 4 entire new gullies have been constructed with the necessary sewer connections, and 343 cleansed and generally examined and repaired; 128 loads of soil have been removed from the sewers and gullies throughout the parish; 25 new house-drains have been constructed and connected with the public sewers, consisting of 1 12-inch, 25 9-inch, and 10 6-inch, and 1 house-drain trapped. ROAD AND PAYING WORKS. For the necessary maintenance and repair to the different roadways in the parish, 1960¼ cube yards of material have been used in the following quantities, viz.:— 14 270¼ cube yards of Ballast. 316¼ „ Hoggin. 1373¾ „ Granite (broken.) 24½ square yards new Granite Paving laid down. (Of this quantity If were for the various Companies.) 12546/9 ,, ,, second-hand Granite laid. 108055/9 ,, „ Carriageway relaid.

The employment of a steam road roller upon various streets during the year for a total period of 67½ days has greatly improved the appearance and durability of those streets, and will necessarily prove a saving ultimately in the cost of the annual repairs. I am, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, GEORGE J. COX, Surveyor. REPORT OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, FOR 1878. To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, The number of deaths arising from all causes in Clerkenwell, during the year 1878, was 1,303. The annual average of the last ten years was 1,422, so that the deaths were 119 below the average. The deaths in 1877 having been 1,385, those in 1878 were 82 less than in the preceding year. The accompanying table exhibits the number of deaths which have taken place in each of the last ten years, the births in each year being placed opposite :— 16  deaths. BIRTHS. 1869 1,512 2,410 1870 1,473 2,415 1871 1,417 2,274 1872 1,323 2,353 1873 1,513 2,664 1874 1,417 2,565 1875 1,539 2,505 1876 1,342 2,559 1877 1,385 2,522 1878 1,303 2,590 The births were thus 68 more than in the preceding year, and 105 more than the average. According to the Registrar-General's sub-districts in which the deaths and births occurred, they stand thus:— deaths. births. excess. St. -James 402 776 374 Amwell 343 622 279 Pentonville 244 539 295 Groswell 314 653 339 In each year a number of the deaths of the parishioners takes place in general and special Hospitals, and in Lunatic Asylums, situated in other parishes. The number of these estimated for 1878 is 99. The number of births having been 2,590, and of deaths 1,303, the excess, or the natural increase of population, is 1,287. The number of deaths which occurred in the parish in 1878, is the smallest number which has occurred since the existence of the Vestry. The number of deaths arising from the principal zymotic diseases in 1878, was 235; being a diminution of 49 in regard to the preceding year. The numbers and causes of the deaths taking place from these principal zymotic diseases during the last ten years are exhibited in the subjoined table:— 17  small pox. measles. scarlet fever. hooping cough. typhus. diarrhoea. total. 1869 0 28 116 81 74 44 343 1870 6 63 122 19 70 40 320 1871 60 23 33 62 68 33 279 1872 15 35 20 105 76 23 274 1873 0 48 13 49 29 95 234 1874 2 63 71 38 31 55 260 1875 2 36 76 82 24 58 278 1876 2 48 34 41 12 73 210 1877 15 73 82 36 25 53 284 1878 1 39 41 56 25 73 235 The average number of deaths from the principal zymotic diseases during the past ten years was 271, so that the number for 1878 is 136 below the average. The number of deaths arising from all diseases in infants under 1 year of age was 394; 5 less than in the preceding year. 197 deaths occurred at and above 60; being 11 less than in the preceding year. 119 inquest-deaths were registered in the year; being 6 more than in the preceding year. 59 deaths occurred in the Workhouse; 31 of males, 28 of females. The numbers in the preceding year were 73, 47, and 26 respectively. 18 14 deaths took place in the House of Correction; 6 in the House of Detention. 40 deaths arose from violence. Hence the mortality of the year has been below the average. The mortality amounted to 19 per 1,000; if the persons dying in Hospitals, &c., be added, the mortality would amount to 21 per 1,000. In 20 large English towns the mortality per 1,000 in 1878 was:— London, 23.5; Brighton, 21.2; Portsmouth, 19.0; Norwich, 24.0; Plymouth, 25.3; Bristol, 21.4; Wolverhampton, 23.3; Birmingham, 25.6; Leicester, 20.8; Nottingham, 21.0; Liverpool, 29.4; Manchester, 27.9; Salford, 25.6; Oldham, 25.8; Bradford, 22.5; Leeds, 23.8; Sheffield, 25.0; Hull, 24.3; Sunderland. 25.6; Newcastle-on-Tyne, 23.8. The mortality in all London was 23.5; that of the West districts, 21.6; of the North districts, 22.3; of the Central districts, 24.9; of the East districts, 24.9; and of the South districts, 24.2. I have already stated, that the number of deaths occurring in the year is less than any that has previously occurred; this would naturally tend to prove that the mortality of the year had been unexceptionally low. As there has been no Census since 1871, the exact population must be uncertain; and a glance at the vacant spaces in the parish, from which buildings have been pulled down, might lead to the belief that a diminution of the number of dwellings causing a corresponding diminution of the population, would necessarily account for a reduced mortality. But when it is found that the number of births has increased, the conclusion appears irresistible, that the mortality has really experienced a reduction. Small Pox.—The epidemic of Small Pox continued during the year, especially in the earlier months. 89 cases are known to have occurred, 10 of them in the Model Buildings. Of these, 57 were removed, mostly to the Asylum Board Hospitals. 19 11 of the cases occurred in January; 6 in February; 13 in March; 26 in April; 14 in May; 8 in June; 6 in July; 1 in September; 1 in October; and 3 in November. I have remarked that about one-ninth of these cases occurred in Model Buildings in the parish. As the occupants of these buildings by no means form one-tenth of the occupants of the houses in the parish, the proportion is large. In the erection of new Model Buildings, I hope the most important point will receive attention, viz.:—that the rooms should not communicate with each other, except through a passage Otherwise, a family may occupy several rooms, but as they all communicate, the occupation is really that of one room only, so that no isolation is at all possible in case of any infectious disease occurring. In regard to the other (should be) preventible or zymotic diseases, the table shows:—That the number of deaths from Measles was considerably less than in the preceding year; that from Scarlet Fever also less; that from Hooping Cough was larger; from Typhus, the same ; and from Diarrhoea, considerably increased. 7 of the cases included under the head of Scarlet Fever, were returned as arising from Diphtheria. The deaths included under the head of Typhus, comprised 2 from Typhus proper, 20 from Typhoid or Enteric Fever, and 3 from simple continued Fever. Slaughter-houses.—The Slaughter-houses were inspected in August. They were 19; 9 in the upper Wards, and 10 in the lower. They were mostly in very good order. In 9 of them, however, some sanitary improvements were required. Cow-houses.—These were also inspected, at the same time as the Slaughter-houses. They were 24, mostly in good order, but in 10 instances, sanitary improvements were required. The cows were in excellent condition. An important decision in regard to the cubic air-space required for each cow, was made by the Magistrates at the (December) 20 Sessions, viz.:—That each cow should have 800 cubic feet, no greater height than 18 feet to be taken into account, (the jecent bye-laws of the Metropolitan Board limit the height to 16 feet.) Bakehouses.—The Bakehouses were not inspected during the year. Mortuary.—The utility of the Mortuary has continued. During the year, 293 bodies were removed to it; 99 of these related to inquest cases; 67 came from the Workhouse; and 127 from other sources, 14 of which were the bodies of the drowned in the terrible "Princess Alice" disaster. 42 post-mortems were made in the Mortuary during the year. The Meteorology of the year, was as follows:— 1878. Temperature, Average. Difference from average of 107 years. Dew-point. Humidity (Saturation = 100.) Height of Barometer. Rain in inches. Difference from average of 63 years Year 49.6 +1.0 43.8 81 29.75 29.2 +3.8 Winter Quarter (Jan., Feb., March) 41.5 +2.8 36.3 82 29.99 3.1 —2.0 Spring Quarter (April, May, June) 54.6 +2.3 47.3 77 29.68 13.2 +7.6 Summer Quarter (July, August, Sept.) 60.8 +0.9 53.9 78 29.75 6.5 —0.9 Autumn Quarter (Oct., Nov., Dec.) 41.6 —2.0 37.9 87 29.57 6.4 —0.9 22 Hence the mean temperature of the whole year was slightly above the average; that of the winter, spring, and summer quarters being above, and that of the autumn quarter below the average. The amount of rain was considerably above the average, the principal excess falling during the 6pring months. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. w.

Gentlemen, During the quarter ending on the 30th of September, I received from your Inspectors, 44 samples for analysis, consisting of Coffee, Cocoa, Bread, Butter, Flour, Gin, Milk, and Ices. Two of the samples of Milk were adulterated, one with 6 per cent., and the other with 14 per cent, of water. The other samples were unadulterated. A large proportion of them, namely—21, consisted of the cheap Ices sold in the street, which has been collected by desire of your Board, with the view of ascertaining whether these cheap sweetmeats so largely supplied to children in warm weather contained anything injurious to health. The analysis made of them showed that they consisted of harmless sweetened and flavoured liquids, of which the worst that could be said was that the flavouring was not always of the most refined description.

At a Meeting of the Vestry, held on the 18th December, 1873. "The Clerk called attention to the fact that since "the Vestry had ceased to collect the Poor Rate, which "duty had reverted to the Guardians or Governors of "the Poor under the Local Act, and which Board had "been revived for the purpose in November, 1871, "there was no Poor Rate Account published, except "the remainder of those in collection by the Vestry "previous to that time, and suggested whether it would "not be desirable, by an agreement between both "Boards, to publish the Poor Rate Account of the "Guardians or Governors as an appendix to the Annual "Reports of the Vestry, in which case there would be "one and a half years' Poor Rate Account to be appended "to the Report about to be issued for the year ended "Lady-day last. "It was moved by Mr. Bamford, seconded by "Mr. Dore, and— "Resolved that such suggestion be approved and "adopted." (Extract from Board Minutes.) ROBERT PAGET, Vestry Clerk.
