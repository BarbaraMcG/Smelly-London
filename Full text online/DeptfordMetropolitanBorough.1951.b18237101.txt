To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough during 1951. In order that the report shall be accurate in detail it is necessary to await the receipt of the details of registered births, deaths etc., from the Registrar General, and I shall consequently have left the service of the Council before this Report can be published. In view of the high costs of printing I have endeavoured to condense the report as much as possible whilst retaining the statistical data which may be of use in subsequent years and which may not, in the future, be readily obtainable from other sources. The year 1951 was a period of steady progress in Deptford and whilst there were no outstanding advances nor any major calamities, there was a gradual improvement in hygiene and living standards throughout the year in the face of substantial difficulties and shortages. Environmental public health is very largely bound up with housing and many of the housing problems are of a national and possibly a political nature which cannot be solved on a local basis, but in spite of this, it was possible during 1951 to deal with many minor problems. These small matters taken individually are of little consequence but taken as a whole provide grounds for reasonable satisfaction —if indeed it can be considered that any satisfaction is justified whilst the major problems remain. I am indebted to the Council and particularly to the Members of the Public Health Committee for their encouragement and to the Officers of the Council for their ready help and co-operation. My thanks are also due to my own staff for their loyal assistance at all times. I remain, Your obedient Servant, R. Duncan Dewar, Medical Officer of Health. STAFF Medical Officer of Health R.

The proportions of old or young vary in different areas and the Registrar General gives Area Comparability factors which take these variations into account. The factor for births is 0.97 and for deaths 0.98 and the birth rate and death rate should be multiplied by the appropriate factor when making comparisons with rates in other towns. The figure for population is now the estimated mid-year home population which includes members of the armed forces stationed in the area. The estimated decrease in the population is 540, whereas the number of births exceed the number of deaths by 310. The table setting out the causes of deaths will be found in the Appendix Table I. The deaths are classified under the 36 headings based on the Abbreviated List of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death, 1948.

There was once again a large number of cases of measles which accounted for more than two-thirds of the total notifications and there was one death from this disease. Poliomyelitis. Only two cases were notified during 1951 as compared with ten cases in the previous year. Sonne Dysentery. During March, sporadic cases of Sonne Dysentery started to be reported. They continued through April and May and gradually stopped in June. There was no apparent connection between the cases, except that several members of individual families were often affected. Wherever a case was reported, the contacts were tested to see if they were carriers or were sub-clinical cases of the disease. Many specimens from these contacts proved positive and these people were given letters to their doctors to this effect. All positive cases were followed up after treatment. Arrangements were made for food handlers found to be " positive " to carry on non-food-handling duties until successfully treated.

Includes deaths from all forms of pneumonia. Tuberculosis remains one of the most important of all diseases in this country from an economic point of view. In many cases it is a chronic disease and even if it does not kill it may cause a very prolonged absence from work and more or less permanent disability. Moreover it commonly attacks young adults when they have just started to be an economic asset to the community. The deaths due to respiratory tuberculosis in Deptford in 1951 were 32 males and 15 females as compared with 19 and 7 respectively during the previous year. The excess of males is largely due to the presence of Carrington house, a common lodging house for men with upwards of 800 beds, situated within the Borough. Of the 32 male deaths, 10 were of persons residing at this lodging house. Of the deaths from respiratory tuberculosis 27 of the 32 male deaths and 14 of the 15 female deaths were in persons between the ages of 15 and 65 years, whereas of the deaths from all causes, only about 30% were within this age group.

Details of inspections and sanitary improvements effected will be found in the Appendix Tables II and 111, but a summary of the work is shown below with comparative figures for some previous years : — 1938 1946 1950 1951 9,505 8,609 7,423 Total primary inspections 7,873 19,968 25,295 Total re-inspections 23,840 25,536 2,694 1,758 2,406 2,225 Total intimation notices served 824 702 935 972 Total statutory notices served Total premises on which works were completed 2,657 2,585 1,695 2,495 Total improvements effected during the year 11,425 3,937 9,950 8,563 In general defects were dealt with under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 and the Housing Act, 1936, Section 9, was only used in one instance. Smoke Abatement The problem of nuisance from the emission of smoke, grit, etc., is one requiring constant attention. In some instances the industrial process is one where the emission of smoke cannot be avoided. In some difficulty arises from the poor quality of the fuel used and in others from the inability through shortages of material, or labour, or in obtaining the necessary licences, to carry out the modifications to the plant which would prevent the emission of undue quantities of smoke. The regular visits for inspection and observation and the advice given have produced some improvement but some nuisance does exist from time to time particularly where high blocks of flats have been built in proximity to the industrial installations. Offensive Trades In two premises in the Borough occupations are carried on which come within the definition of offensive trades. These have been regularly inspected and the work in general is well conducted. No notices were necessary in this connection. 11 Rodent Control One Rodent Supervisor and two Operators were employed throughout the year and the following tables summarise the work carried out :— PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Report for Year ended 31st December, 1951. Type of Property Local Authority Dwelling Houses Agricultural All other (including Business and Industrial) Total Total number of properties in Local Authority's District 26 16,155 2,670 18,851 - Number of properties inspected by the Local Authority during 1951 as a result (a) of notification or (b) otherwise (a) 2 - 294 22 318 (b) 3 219 - 105 327 Number of properties (under II) found to be infested by rats Major Minor 1 292 - 25 318 Number of properties (under II) found to be seriously infested by mice 70 - 9 81 2 Number of infested properties (under 111 and IV) treated by the Local Authority - 3 362 34 399 Number of notices served under Section 4: Treatment 1 1 2 - Number of " block " control schemes carried out 2. A high proportion of business premises in the borough have their own contracts with private service companies for the control and destruction of rats and mice. This largely accounts for the smallness of the figures relating to business premises. 12 Disinfection and Cleansing The use of the disinfector at the South-Eastern Fever Hospital (now renamed the New Cross General Hospital) was continued as a temporary measure throughout the year, the Bathing Station also occupying part of the hospital premises. Neither of these are entirely satisfactory. It is also anticipated that the Regional Hospital Board will require the premises to be vacated in the near future. It is hoped that the construction of the proposed new station will be commenced during 1952. The following is a summary of the work of disinfection, disinfestation and cleansing : — Premises disinfected (infectious disease) 281 Premises disinfected (requests) 46 Premises disinfected (verminous condition) 448 Premises disinfected (removals) 5 Total number of articles disinfected 101,616 Books disinfected 94 Number of articles destroyed at owner's request 233 In addition to the normal disinfection a considerable amount of work was done for firms engaged in exporting second-hand clothing and rags mainly to certain parts of Africa where the clothing is not allowed to be imported unless previously disinfected. The total dealt with during 1951 was 75,950 garments and approximately 6 tons of rags. Bathing Centre Number of school children who received baths (other than for scabies) 851 Number of school children who received baths for the treatment of scabies 13 Adults who received baths (other than for scabies) 493 Scabies baths for adults 23 Water Supply The water supply for domestic purposes for the whole of the Borough is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. Routine bacteriological examination is not normally carried out by the Council but the Water Board have supplied information on the bacteriological purity when requested. The water supply has been fully satisfactory throughout the year. Certificates in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, that dwelling houses had a proper and efficient water supply were issued in respect of 35 new premises comprising 3 houses and 32 flats. THE FACTORIES ACT, 1937 The following is an epitomised statement of the administration of the Act. The inspections, visits, etc., are carried out by the District Sanitary Inspectors. 15 Inspections Number of Number on Register Notices Written Occupiers Prosecuted Inspections (1) Factories in which Sections 1, 2, 3,4 and 6 are to be enforced by Local Authorities - 58 28 1 (2) Factories not included in (1) in which Section 7 is enforced by the Local Authority - 316 246 18 Defects Found Referred Remedied Found To H.M. Inspector By H.M. Inspector Sanitary Conveniences: Unsuitable or Defective 19 19 2 12 The types of premises inspected were as follows: — Bakehouses. Printers. Chemical works. Stables, etc. Cinemas. Sawmills. Dressmakers, etc. Timber stores. Engineering, general. Tar refiners. Engineering, motoring. Tailors. Foundries. Woodwork joiners, etc. Food preparation. Woodchoppers. Glass bottle makers. Whitening manufacturers. Laundries, cleaners. Offensive trades. Marine stores. Miscellaneous. Paint and varnish works. The number of inspections made to home workers premises was 156. The types of work carried on by outworkers in this Borough were as follows:— Wearing apparel, umbrellas, artificial flowers, paper bags, string bags and lampshades. Section " D " FOOD AND DRUGS AND REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST 16 FOOD AND DRUGS A full-time Food Inspector is employed in the supervision of Food and Food Premises. Food Samples are sent for chemical analysis to the Public Analyst, and for bacteriological examination to The Public Health Laboratory Service at Park Hospital. Details of the work of the Food Inspector will be found in the Appendix Tables V, VI and VII and details from the Public Analyst's Report are included at the end of this section. Royal Victoria Yard Considerable quantities of food no longer considered fit for prolonged storage by the Admiralty, are examined in order to assess their fitness for sale to the general public. Ice-Cream Conditions under which ice-cream is made and distributed in the Borough have continued to improve. 186 premises are registered for the manufacture, storage or sale of Ice Cream. Fifty-eight samples were taken for bacteriological examination. Grade I 32 Grade II 20 Grade III 3 Grade IV 3 58 Labelling of Food Orders, 1946/50 All pre-packed samples of food submitted under the Food and Drugs Act were considered also under the Labelling of Food Orders, 1946 and 1950. In 39 instances separate examinations were made under these Orders and several slight infringements were dealt with by correspondence. Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941 All pre-packed drugs submitted under the Food and Drugs Act were also considered under the Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941. In 2 instances separate reports were made. Food Standards Seventy-two samples were specially examined under the various Food Standard Orders. In three instances infringements were dealt with by informal action. Public Health (Preservatives etc. in Food) Regulations Wherever desirable Food and Drugs Act samples were examined for the presence of prohibited preservatives and colouring matters and for excessive amounts of the permitted preservatives. No action was found necessary under the regulations. 19 Mineral Oil in Food Order 1949 Twenty-one samples were taken under the Order—no contraventions were found. Public Health (Condensed Milk) Regulations Nine samples were submitted. Artificial Cream Act, 1929 " Imitation " Cream is made in this Borough but it is not covered by the definition of " Artificial Cream "in the above-mentioned Act. This material is, however, such a good medium for the growth of bacteria that the processing and distribution is subject to frequent inspection and sampling. School Milks Fourteen samples were sent for chemical examination and nineteen were sent for bacteriological examination. Five samples were also sent from Day Nurseries. Milk (Special Designations) Act Twenty-four samples were submitted. In two instances failure to comply was taken up with the wholesale dairies concerned and follow-up samples were found to be in order. Foreign Bodies in Milk Bottles Several complaints of glass in milk bottles and of dirty milk bottles were received. Mainly there was insufficient evidence to substantiate legal proceedings, but the complaints were taken up with the dairies concerned. In one case a conviction was obtained in respect of a dirty milk bottle. Foreign Bodies in Food Several instances were found of foreign bodies in food. In the main, insufficient evidence was available to ensure successful prosecution and the makers of the food in question were warned. In one case a successful prosecution was instituted. The following is an extract from the report of the Public Analyst, Dr. H. Amphlett Williams, Ph.D. (Lond.), A.C.G.F.C., F.R.1.C., for the year 1951. " During the year, 527 samples were submitted for analysis under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, by your Sampling Officers. These samples were also examined wherever applicable under the Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations, 1943, the Food Standards Orders, 1944-51, and the Labelling of Food Orders, 1946-51. " Of the total number, 91 were taken formally, in accordance with the procedure prescribed under the Food and Drugs Act, the remaining 436 being undivided, or informal samples. " Full particulars of samples submitted and results of analyses under the Food and Drugs Act have been furnished in the Quarterly Reports ; 20 adulteration or irregularities were found in 32 instances ; and the following Table summarises the proportions of milk samples and other samples of food and drugs recorded as unsatisfactory during the year, with the corresponding figures for the three previous years : Number Submitted Number " Adulterated " Percentage " Adulterated " 164 353 517 Milk samples Other samples Total 4 2.4 1948 28 7.9 32 6.2 128 401 529 Milk samples Other samples Total 0 0 1949 16 4.0 16 3.0 87 442 529 Milk samples Other samples Total 2 2.3 1950 26 5.9 28 5.3 106 421 527 Milk samples Other samples Total 10 9.4 1951 22 5.2 32 6.1 " Of the 106 samples of milk analysed, 88 were submitted as Sunday samples, 18 having been taken on week-days. " The average composition of the milk as sampled is shown in the following Table ; the figures for an exceptional sample, No. 83, which contained 60% of added water, having been excluded. Fat Fat Solids-not-fat Total solids Total solids Feb.-April 1951 3.45 8.47 11.92 Whole Year 1951 3.52 8.63 12.15 Deptford Year 1950 3.44 8.70 12.14 Southern England Pre-VVar Average 3.75 8.89 12.64 Year 1949 Year 1948 Year 1947 3.45 8.72 12.17 3.51 8.68 12.19 3.47 8.74 12.21 " As in previous years the proportion of milk solids shows a noticeable fall in the late winter months, as compared with pre-war averages. Indeed, for the first time the average percentage of solids-not-fat occurring in February to April actually fails to reach the minimum legal standard (8-5%), below which milk is presumed to be not genuine. The high percentage of ' adulterated ' milks recorded above, 9.4% was with one exception due to samples falling somewhat below the legal standard for solids-not-fat, but in which the actual presence of added water could not be definitely proved. " The 22 other samples reported as unsatisfactory comprised 15 different classes of food and 1 drug, a Tincture of lodine. They included 19 4 samples of Canned Fruits and 1 of Tomato Soup, which had become contaminated by dissolved metal due to corrosion ; and 1 sample of Canned Sardines, which was undergoing decomposition. A sample of Ice Cream contained only 3% of fat, instead of at least 5% as required by the Food Standards Order ; a sample of Beef Suet contained added rice flour, and 2 samples of Pork Brawn contained 5 and 7% of chopped bone ; a sample of Fruit Pie was stale and rancid, and a sample of Cake Mixture also contained rancid fat ; 2 samples of Dried Milk were not of satisfactory quality owing to deterioration or other defects, and a packet of Cocoa had been damaged by the Cocoa Moth ; a sample described as " Seed Tapioca " consisted of Sago ; a sample of Pork Sausage was deficient in meat, and a sample of Uncooked Pastry deficient in fat ; and 2 samples of Table Jelly failed to set satisfactorily when made up. " No further instances of the use of mineral oils in cakes or other foods were detected during 1951. " In addition to the analyses under the Food and Drugs Act, the results of which have been summarised above, 115 samples were examined under other Acts, Orders and Regulations. Particulars of these samples are furnished below : Number of Samples Number Failing to Comply Relevant Act or Order Article Nature of Irregularity Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations 1943 Sponge Cake & Pudding Flour Mixture Unsweetened (No. 2) The word " Unsweetened" was printed in small type and was inconspicuous.

Drainage Liquors and other specimens re obstruction of sewers. " The total number of samples of all kinds analysed during the year was 539." Section " E " HOUSING 24 HOUSING At the end of 1951 the Council had a total of 669 permanent houses and flats, a total of 586 temporary houses of various types and controlled a further 1,444 properties under requisition. The requisitioned properties housed 2,103 units of tenancy. During the year, 27 permanent flats were completed for the Council, and 88 flats, 10 maisonettes and 10 shops were in the course of construction. 1951 was like previous years, a year of austerity with accompanying shortages and controls, but property owners were generally co-operative in complying with sanitary notices ; 8,563 improvements were carried out in 2,495 houses, somewhat less than last year but it is interesting to note that outstanding works at the end of the year were down to 470 as compared with 719 the previous year. This may be due to the fact that in view of Magistrates excluding decorative work from Nuisance Orders, Sanitary Inspectors are confining their notices to structural matters. The problems of the repair and maintenance of dwelling houses were no less acute in 1951 than in previous years. The rising cost of repairs made the maintenance of old houses uneconomic in many cases. A large proportion of these old houses are admittedly sub-standard and do not provide those amenities which are now considered to be essential in new buildings. They do, however, provide " reasonable " accommodation at a rental which the poorer paid members of the community can afford. Private owners are, not unreasonably, unwilling to maintain houses which cannot possibly provide any return on the necessary capital outlay and the local authority is equally unwilling to take over all these properties which are uneconomic and at the same time leave those houses which provide a reasonable return in private ownership. In the maintenance of existing property the following is a summary of the work done in 1951 :— Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Total number of houses inspected for housing defects 3,202 Number of Statutory Notices served 972 Number of houses repaired or nuisances remedied 2,495 Housing Act, 1936 Number of houses represented to the Council 3 Number of Demolition Orders made by the Council, following representation — Number of houses repaired by owners — Number of houses, the subject of Closing Orders 3 Number of Closing Orders determined — 25 Overcrowding Number of individual dwellings overcrowded at the end of the year 127 Number of families found to be living in overcrowded conditions during year 30 Number of families who have obtained alternative accommodation during year 88 Underground Rooms Number occupied, but unfit 2 Number closed 2 There are many underground rooms throughout the Borough and a fairly high proportion of them, although used as dwellings, do not conform in all respects with the statutory requirements and cannot without major structural alterations be made to do so. Closure is not, however, practicable in present circumstances and owners have been co-operative in making these rooms reasonably fit. Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts Certificates of Disrepair were granted in 4 cases during the year. Section "F" PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES 28 PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES The London County Council, as the Local Health Authority, became responsible for the health services set out in Part 111 of the National Health Service Act on 5th July, 1948. These services are now commonly referred to as the " personal " health services as distinct from the environmental health services for which the Metropolitan Boroughs continue to be responsible. The services which are provided at the various clinics are as follows :— Health Centre, Amersham Road, S.E.14 Infant Welfare, Toddlers, Ante-Natal and Post-Natal clinics. Ante-Natal exercise clinic. Vaccination and Immunisation. Artificial sunlight. Sewing class. Foot clinic. Rheumatism and Nutrition clinics. St. George's Hall, Shardeloes Road, S.E.4 Infant Welfare and Ante-natal clinics. St. Luke's Halt, Gosterwood Street, S.E.8 Infant Welfare clinic. Princess Louise Institute, Hales Street, S.E.8 Infant Welfare clinic. St. John's Nurses' Home, Watson Street, S.E.8 Ante-natal clinic. School Treatment Centre, Reginald Square. Dental clinic. Ophthalmic. Special Aural and Minor Ailment clinics. The County Council also maintain two Day Nurseries. The nursery in Evelyn Street is a special prefabricated building with 40 places under normal conditions. The other nursery was housed in the buildings of the New Cross General Hospital in Avonley Road. This nursery was transferred to the Health Centre, Amersham Road in the early part of 1952. In both nurseries children are accepted from a few weeks old up to 5 years of age. The Health Centre at Amersham Road is also used as the Divisional Sub-Office for the administration of the personal health services in the Deptford area, including the offices for the Health Visitors and the Organiser and staff dealing with the Domestic Help Service. The headquarters of the Divisional Medical Officer are at St. Paul's House, Deptford High Street. Section " G " MISCELLANEOUS 30 MISCELLANEOUS Canal Boats Act The section of the Grand Surrey Canal passing through the Borough was kept under observation by the District Inspector but no canal boats were found of a type requiring inspection. Common Lodging Houses There is only one Common Lodging House in the Borough. This is Carrington House which is maintained by the London County Council. This building was erected in 1903 and it contains 814 separate cubicles, for use by men only. In addition to the usual facilities for washing and bathing, there is a reading room and a smoking room. The dining room is provided with a large stove on which the men can cook their own meals, and in addition, there is a canteen which provides excellent meals at a low price. A sick bay is provided on the ground floor for cases awaiting admission to hospital. No nursing of any sort is provided but sick persons are not so isolated as they would be in cubicles on an upper floor, and serious or dangerous illness is less likely to be overlooked. The standard of accommodation is high and it compares favourably with many of the rooms occupied by single elderly men throughout the district. Laboratory Service The bacteriological laboratory at the Park Hospital is run in association with the Public Health Laboratory Service. It provides a full bacteriological service for all public health requirements and the examinations are carried out without charge to the local authority. It has the additional advantages that the laboratory can carry out the very large number of bacteriological examinations which might be required during an epidemic, and that help can be provided to assist in the field work necessary in tracing the source of infection. The laboratory facilities at the Devonport Laboratory, Seamen's Hospital, continue to be available for the examination of swabs and other specimens sent by general practitioners. A week-end service is provided here and it is rather more convenient for the general practitioner to call for a consultation with the pathologist—a matter of some importance with the increasing complexity of bacteriological examinations. Mortuary and Coroner's Court Before the war both the Boroughs of Deptford and Greenwich maintained their own mortuaries and coroner's courts. By arrangement, and following war damage, the coroner's court at Deptford and the mortuary at Greenwich have been closed. The mortuary at Watson Street, Deptford, serves both the Boroughs as does the coroner's court at Greenwich. The number of bodies received at the mortuary is, as a result of this arrangement, approximately doubled. The number of bodies received during 1951 was 660. 31 National Assistance Act, 1948 Burial of the Dead Under Section 50 of the above Act it is the duty of the Council to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who dies or is found dead within the Borough, and where no private arrangements are made for the disposal of the remains. Ten persons were buried under the provisions of this Act during 1951 Removal of Aged and Infirm Persons to Institutions Section 47 of this Act provides for securing the necessary care and attention for the aged and chronic sick by means of an order of the Court. The main difficulty in securing the necessary care is in obtaining a vacancy in a suitable institution. The hospital provides accommodation for the chronic sick but there is a waiting list and admission may be delayed for weeks or in some few cases, months. The turn-over of beds is naturally very much slower than with acute cases and vacancies are consequently comparatively infrequent. The hospitals require to be assured that the patient is in need of a hospital bed, either on the grounds that medical treatment is required which cannot be given at home, or that the patient is bedridden and requires nursing care as a result. The London County Council provides accommodation for persons who are unable properly to care for themselves but who are not in need of nursing care, and who can get up and wash and dress themselves. There is at present a lack of provision for those persons who by reason of age or chronic ill-health require a certain amount of nursing care, who may be unable to wash and dress themselves or to walk without difficulty, but who are not bedridden. They are too well for the hospital and too ill for the County Council's Homes. In spite of the difficulties, both the Hospitals and the County Council have been very helpful in dealing with the many difficult and distressing cases. Action under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act was contemplated in several cases during 1951 but it was not found necessary to take action to remove any person. Services for Old People The voluntary services in the district provide some assistance and recreation for old people. The W.V.S. have organised five Derby and Joan Clubs in various parts of the Borough so that one or more is within reasonable reach of persons living in any part of the district. In addition, the Albany Institute Old People's Club, although situated just beyond the Borough boundary, is patronised mainly by Deptford people. A Meals-on-Wheels service operates in the Borough. This supplies meals to aged and infirm people in their homes twice a week, to five of the Darby and Joan Clubs once a week, and to the Albany Institute daily from Monday to Friday. The meals are obtained from the London County Council's meals service and supplied to the old people at a charge of 10d. each. The vehicle was supplied and fitted by the Borough Council, 32 which also provides the driver and maintains the vehicle. The remainder of the work is done by members of the W.V.S. Approximately 8,000 meals were supplied during the year, of which 3,700 were supplied to old people in their own homes and the remainder at the clubs. Shops Act, 1934 In the course of their routine inspection the Sanitary Inspectors paid attention to the ventilation and temperature of shops and the provision of washing accommodation and sanitary conveniences. Slaughter Houses Two slaughter houses are licensed in this Borough but were not in use during the year. Baths and Wash-Houses The Council maintains three swimming baths at Laurie Grove adjoining the Town Hall. A plant giving continuous filtration and sterilisation maintains the purity of the water at all times. The plant is capable of filtering the whole of the water in the baths within four hours and the system of " break-point " chlorination ensures the purity and safety of the water even during periods of maximum use. Two of the swimming baths are open all the year, but the large bath is closed from October until April, during which time a sprung floor is put in place and the building is used as a hall. In addition to the swimming baths there are 60 slipper baths for public use at Laurie Grove. At the Evelyn Baths, Clyde Street, there are 60 slipper baths and facilities for Russian Vapour Baths and Foam Baths, and in addition a public wash-house is provided. At the baths at Ilderton Road 18 slipper baths are provided.
