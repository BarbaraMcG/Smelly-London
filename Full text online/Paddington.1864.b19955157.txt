BURDON-SANDERSON, M.D., Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, Assistant Physician to Middlesex Hospital, and to the Hospital for Consumption. medical officer of health. REPORT TO THE VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Vestry Hall; July, 1865. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you the usual Annual Summary of the proceedings of the Sanitary Committee in the execution of the powers vested in them by law, or entrusted to them by the Vestry, for the Sanitary improvement of the Parish of Paddington. During the year terminating on the 31st of December, 1864, 298 Orders for the improvement of houses, or for the removal of nuisances were issued by the Sanitary Committee, all of which were eventually complied with. The proceedings commenced in 1863, under the Local Management Act, relating to the houses Nos. 29—48, North Wharf Road, and Nos. 2—20, Dudley Street, have been carried on, and the requirements of the Vestry have been in part complied with. The drainage has been somewhat improved, and covered cisterns fitted with suitable self-closing valves, and other water supply apparatus have been fixed at a sufficient height for the 12 effectual scouring of the water closets. The execution of other works has been deferred on account of the alleged poverty of the owner. With this exception, no proceedings have been taken under this Act. During the year ending last Lady-Day, the Sanitary Inspector was authorized to take proceedings at the Metropolitan Police Court in the following instances:—On the 8th of April, 1864, complaint was made against Mr. H. Cheeseman, Fishmonger, of No. 70, Praed Street, in respect of a nuisance, consisting in the accumulation of oyster shells, remnants of fish and other refuse of trade on his premises. The case having been heard on the following Tuesday, the defendant was ordered to pay the costs, and to abate the nuisance, which was accordingly done. On the 22nd of April proceedings were taken against Mr. T. J. Mead ; this case was heard on the 25th of the same month. It having been proved that the house No. 29, St. Stephen's Road was in such a state as to be injurious to the health of the Inhabitants, by reason of the insufficiency and obstructed condition of the drainage, the further hearing of the case was adjourned, in order that the defendant might carry out the necessary works. On the 9th of May, when the case was heard again, it appeared that the drainage had been so far amended, as to abate the nuisance; 13 the Summons was therefore dismissed, the defendant being required to pay the costs. Lastly, on the 2nd of March, 1865, a Summons was obtained against the occupier of No. 33, Caroline Place, in respect of animals of various descriptions, so kept as to be a nuisance, and injurious to health. The complaint was heard on the 14th of March, when it appeared that the nuisance had already been abated ; the proceedings were dropped on the payment of costs. In addition to these cases, in which it was necessary actually to make complaint at the Police Court, there were several in which the nuisances complained of, were abated in compliance with the preliminary notice which is always served before proceedings are commenced. Bake-houses. At the close of the Session of 1863, an Act was passed, having for its object, to secure greater cleanliness and better ventilation of bake-houses, and to limit the hours of labour of young persons employed therein. In this Act it is provided, with respect to cleanliness, that the interior of every bake-house must be either limewashed or painted. If it is limewashed, the limewashing must be renewed every six months ; if it is painted, the paint must be washed with soap and water as 14 frequently, and renewed once in seven years. As regards supply of air, it is simply required that the bake-house shall be furnished with " proper means for effectual ventilation." The nature of these means is not specified, nor is the cubic space to be allowed to each workman limited. It is further provided that no room on the same level with the bake-house shall be used as a sleeping place, unless it is separated therefrom by a partition, extending from the floor to the ceiling, and is provided with an external glazed window, at least nine square feet in area, and made to open for ventilation to at least half that extent. But the Act contains no regulation as to places on a different level, or in a separate building from the bake-house, so that however small, ill ventilated, dilapidated, or otherwise unfit for its purpose such a sleeping room may be, it is exempted from the operation of the statute. Any occupier of a bake-house failing to keep the same in conformity with the above regulations, is subject to a penalty not exceeding £5, which may be recovered summarily before a Police Magistrate, who may, in addition to the infliction of a fine, make an order, prescribing the means to be adopted by the occupier for the improvement of his bake-house. In order to facilitate the enforcement of the Act, the Inspector of Nuisances is authorized to inspect any bake-house at all times 15 during the hours of baking, and examine whether it is or is not in conformity with the regulations. Any person obstructing the Inspector in his examination, is liable for each offence to a penalty not exceeding £ 20 ; and any Inspector so obstructed, may apply to a Magistrate for a Warrant, authorizing him, accompanied by a Police Constable, to enter and complete his inspection. During the past Winter, detailed reports were presented to the Sanitary Committee on 65 Bakehouses. In these reports were set forth the results of inspection under the heads of (a) Description, dimensions and means of ventilation of Bakehouse ; (b) Description, dimensions and means of ventilation of Sleeping-room ; (c) Limewashing and cleansing; (d) Drainage, with special reference to the state and situation of Water-closets and inlets; (e) number and state of health of journeymen employed ; (f) number sleeping on the premises ; (g) hours of labour. The information was derived as regards 50 Bake-houses from my own observation ; as regards the rest, from the notes of the Inspector. Description of Bake-house.—In 57 instances a room on the basement floor of the house is used as a Bake-house. In the remaining eight there is a separate building, specially constructed for the 16 purpose. When the Bake-house is under the same roof with the dwelling house and shop, it is usually ventilated by one or two doors into the other rooms or passages on the same level, and by a trap or staircase leading to the shop or other room on the ground floor. In addition to these, almost all Bake-houses are provided with one or more ventilating valves or flaps above the ovens' mouths, which are necessarily placed in one of the external walls. The sufficiency of this arrangement obviously depends on the number of persons employed. So long as the quantity of business is limited, it is open to no objection, but in the older streets it seldom happens that a basement room is large enough for the accommodation of more than two or three workmen. Space.—The following Table exhibits the number of cubic feet of breathing space enjoyed by each workman in 26 Bake-houses, the examples selected being of Bake-houses in which three or more journeymen are employed during the night. It is obvious that the quantity of space necessary varies according to the amount of ventilation, but it cannot be disputed that any amount less than 500 cubic feet is insufficient. In an ordinary sleeping-room it is admitted that 300 cubic feet per person is the minimum, and that anything less constitutes over-crowding; but during laborious exertion like that in which the baker is engaged 17 during the greater part of the night, the discharge of effete matter from the lungs is at least double what it is during sleep, while the exhalation from the skin is increased in still greater proportion, so that a man ought to have a much larger space to work in, than to sleep in. The three cases in which the allowance of air per man was smallest, differed considerably as regards ventilation. In one case the means adopted were so insufficient that it was deemed expedient to give notice to the occupier, requiring him to make certain improvements, which were carried out as effectually as possible, considering the size and confined situation of the premises. In the second case the ventilation was also insufficient, and steps are now being taken for its amendment; but in the third it appeared that no structural alteration was required, and that the state of things could only be amended by diminishing the number of hands employed. TABLE I. Number of cubic feet of breathing space enjoyed by each workman, No. 1.—520. No. 23.-647. No. 48.— 424. 3.-853. 31.—598. 50.— 875. 7.—960. 32.— 896. 56.—1293. 11.—650. 34.—650. 61.— 486. 12.—938. 36.—713. 62bis. 763. 14.—727. 39.-494. 64.— 635. 17.—600. 40.-676. 65.— 930. 19.—548. 42.—710. 72.— 700. 22.—1180. 44.-663. B 18 Sleeping-rooms.- To 36 of the Bake-houses sleeping-rooms were attached; 17 are on the same level, and in the same building, of which one only (No. 38) communicates directly with the Bakehouse. But as regards window-space, infringements were much more frequently met with. In three of the 17 bed-rooms there was no window, but in one of these instances sufficient provision existed notwithstanding both for the admission of light and air. In four others the area of the windows was less than the minimum fixed by the statute- varying in the several cases from 3 feet and three-quarters to 8 feet. Nuisances.- Nuisances arising from foul or obstructed water-closets were met with in no less than fourteen instances. This was comparatively of little consequence when the closet was at a sufficient distance from the Bake-house, but of much greater moment where the objectionable arrangement had been adopted of placing the water-closet for the use of the journeymen, either in the Bake-house itself, or in a recess opening out of it. In all of these cases steps were taken by the Sanitary Committee for the immediate abatement of the evil. In many Bake-houses there are insufficiently trapped inlets to the drains, while in others a generally uncleanly condition was observed. Journeymen.- In the 65 Bake-houses, 141 adult journeymen were employed, not counting either 19 youths who were at work only during the day, or persons carrying on their business themselves. Of these men it was found that 68 slept on the premises, and had no other sleeping place. The rest, who were for the most part married men, were said to sleep at home. In all of these instances excepting one, sleeping-rooms were provided. Hours of labour.- The hours of labour lasted in general throughout the whole night. As regards this important point, it resulted from my enquiries, which were addressed to masters and men indiscriminately, that 70 journeymen began their labours at 11, p.m. or earlier, 12 at midnight, 37 between that hour and 7, a.m., and 32 at various hours after 4, a.m.- Most of these last being employed in baking biscuits. In this statement it is to be understood that no reference is made to the fact, that in every Bake-house the foreman is required, in addition to his night's labour, to attend in the course of the evening to "set his sponge." The Canal Basin. In my last Report were related the communications which took place between the Sanitary Committee and the Grand Junction Canal Company as to the expediency of emptying and refilling the basin during the summer months, and of making proper regulations for the prevention of 20 the pollution of the water by the careless introduction thereinto of manure and other offensive materials. In consequence of these communications, I was invited on the 28th of March to attend a Meeting of the Directors of the Company, at which several of the Wharfingers were also present. I was then informed that it was the intention of the Company to cleanse the basin by hand labour, in Whitsun-week, and that with a view to the regulation of the lading of the barges, it was intended to submit to the proprietors at their next Meeting a Bye-law, by which all persons guilty of fouling the water, whether wilfully or from neglect of proper precautions, would be subjected to a penalty. The basin was accordingly emptied on the 15th of May, and remained empty until the 24th. On examining the channel after the water was let out, it was found that the deposit of black mud with which it was covered, varied in depth from eight inches to a foot. It consisted in the deepest parts in great measure of rotten straw and other light material, which had drifted from the various manure wharves. During the week that the basin was empty, almost the whole of this mud, amounting to several thousand tons, was removed and deposited on the banks. In order to guard against the nuisance likely to arise from the exposure and conveyance through the public thoroughfares of so 21 large a quantity of offensive material, certain regulations were agreed to by the Sanitary Committee to the effect that all clearings from the basin should be immediately covered with lime, and that they should as soon as possible be removed to places selected by the Committee as being at a sufficient distance from inhabited buildings. At the same time the occupiers of wharves adjoining the basin were cautioned that the Sanitary Inspector had been authorized to take proceedings at the Police Court without further instruction, against all persons so neglecting these regulations as to commit a nuisance. These measures, which were energetically carried out by the Inspector, were so far successful, that by the 2nd of June, almost the whole of the material removed from the basin had been conveyed to a safe distance. After the cleansing of the basin the water remained for some time in a good state; but it was evident that so long as the bargemen and labourers on the manure wharves were allowed to continue their present practices, the improvement would be only temporary. With this view the Sanitary Committee resolved on the 16th of June, again to call the attention of the Directors to the nuisance arising from the falling of offensive matters into the basin, and to the fact that ere long the expense and trouble so recently incurred in cleansing it, 22 would be useless. They further requested to be informed whether the Company were prepared, either to make regulations or to employ other means of effectually preventing the evil in question. In reply to this communication the Committee were informed that it was no longer the intention of the Company to make any bye-law for the regulation of the loading of the barges as before suggested, but that they had it in contemplation to take other steps which they believe would be more efficacious. In August, a deputation of the Sanitary Committee, with the Medical Officer, attended the Board of Directors to call their attention to the nuisance arising from the accumulation of manure on their wharf, known as No. 16, near the Bishop's Road Bridge, and to the necessity of putting a stop to all such accumulation, by insisting on the immediate transfer of the manure from the collecting carts directly, without depositing it on the wharves at all. The Board consented to take the matter into their consideration, and accordingly gave notice to those dealers in manure who carried on business on their wharf, that in future they would be subject to a fine of 1s. for every ton of manure allowed to remain more than twenty-four hours on the bank.* At the same time regulations * This regulation has been since enforced, but has proved ineffectual. During the last week (July 18th) the Company have absolutely forbidden the deposit of manure on their premises. 23 were issued by the Vestry, in conformity with the provisions of the Paddington Local Act, for the purpose of restraining the undue detention of offensive matter on the wharves, and shortly afterwards proceedings were taken against one of the wharfingers who had disregarded these regulations. With a similar object in view, it was resolved by the Vestry on the 7th of February to introduce into all future Contracts for Cleansing the Streets a stipulation to the effect, that between the 1st of March and the 1st of November, no slop or road scrapings should be allowed to remain on any wharf for a longer period than forty-eight hours, nor to the extent of a boat load at any time. Slaughter-houses and Cow-houses. During the Summer and Autumn the Slaughterhouses and Cow-houses were carefully examined, and a report was drawn up by the Inspector on each, containing a detailed description of the buildings used, and showing their condition as regards drainage, ventilation and cleanliness. These reports were submitted to the Sanitary Committee with the usual notices of applications for licenses, on the 6th of October. It did not appear expedient to the Committee to shew cause on a Sanitary ground against any of the 24 tions, but it was resolved to bring under the notice of the licensing Magistrate the provisions of the Building Act in 1844, according to which no place in immediate proximity to dwelling houses not previously so used, can be occupied as a slaughterhouse, and the fact that in two instances applications for licences to slaughter cattle were made in respect of buildings which had for some years not been so occupied. On the 31st of October I attended the Special Sessions for granting licences. The applications last referred to being regarded as new applications, and it having been shewn that the buildings in question were within the distance prescribed by the statutes, the licenses were refused. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. BURDON-SANDERSON. TABLE II. WORKS COMPLETED UNDER ORDERS ISSUED DURING THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 1864. Locality. No. of Houses.

LIGHTING AND SEWERS DEPARTMENTS. By GEORGE F. STEVENS, surveyor. REPORT TO THE VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Vestry Hall; June 30th, 1865. Gentlemen, Pursuant to the 198th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act 1855, I beg to submit a Report of Works executed in the Paving, Lighting, and Sewers departments during the year ending March 25th, 1865:— Paving. In consequence of the increase of traffic, four Footways have been re-paved and widened from one to three feet six inches. The pavements of various Footways have been taken up, re-laid and repaired with new stones. Three Footways formerly repaired with gravel have been flagged. The Carriageways in three Mews have been greatly improved, by the removal of the old pebble and rag-stone Paving, and the substitution of new 5-in. by 6-in. squared Granite. 32 Twelve Crossings of Streets have been paved with stones prepared for the purpose. Seven additional Meter Pits have been constructed for Road-Watering purposes, making a total of 41. Nineteen New Streets or portions of Streets, and 3 miles 30 yards of late Turnpike Roads, have been cleansed, watered and repaired, which added to the previously existing streets, make 35 miles 7 furlongs 158 yards, now under the jurisdiction of the Vestry. The total number of openings made by Gas and Water Companies and others in the Streets, is 2016, which have been reinstated at their expense. Under the powers of the Metropolis Local Management Act of 1855, and the Amendment Act of 1862, the Footways and Carriageways in nineteen Streets, or portion of Streets, have been formed and paved in accordance with the regulations of the Vestry, at the cost of the Owners of Property. Lighting. Twenty-seven additional Lamps have been erected, chiefly in the New Streets, making a total number of 1458 Public Lamps. Forty-one Lamps have been removed to new positions, in order to effect an improvement in lighting the Streets, or in widening the Footways. 33 Sewers,&c. Fifty-two Notices have been received for the erection of 233 Buildings, namely, one temporary Church, 206 Houses and 26 Stables, in compliance with the requirements of the 76th section of the Act of 1855. Forty-six applications have been made for the re-construction of Drains under the Public Roads and Footways to 127 Houses and Premises, at the expense of Owners of Property. The following Sewers have been constructed in the undermentioned Streets at the expense of Owners of Property:— ft. ft. in. ft. in. Queensborough Terrace 860 run of 3 . 9 by 2 . 6 whole Brick Sewer.

One side entrance, seven ventilating shafts, and 105 Gully Drains have been constructed in various parts of the Parish; 62 Gulleys have been repaired. Total length of Brick Sewers constructed is 3559 feet. Total length of Drain Pipes laid down is 2 miles, 474 yards. The value of these works I estimate at £ 3960. About three quarters of a mile of Brick Sewers, in which the deposit varied from two to nine inches 34 in depth, have been thoroughly cleansed, the hard deposit which could not be removed by flushing was raised to the surface and carted away. Seventeen hundred and five Gully Drains and Sand Pits have also been cleansed. One Public Urinal, to accommodate six persons, has been erected in North Wharf Road, making two now maintained at the expense of the Vestry. Jobbing Works, comprising 407, separate and distinct works, such as the repair of Sewers and Gulleys, fixing Traps, and other works connected therewith, have been executed by the Contractor to the Vestry, to the value of £ 1192:12:0. This amount includes the sum of £ 608:8:3 received from Owners of Property for fixing Traps at outlets of existing Drains, constructing Gulleys, and laying Drain Pipes under Streets. In addition to the foregoing details, one hundred and eighty three complaints have been received and attended to— they had reference to Sewers, Gulleys, Drains, Pavements, &c. Re-Naming Streets, and Re-Numbering Houses. The following orders of the Metropolitan Board of Works have been carried out in accordance with the 87th Section of the Act of 1862:— 35 ORDER OF BOARD.

BURDON SANDERSON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE VESTRY. Population of Paddington, April, 1861 75,807. Vestry Hall; July, 1864. During the last 14 weeks of 1863, 366 persons of all ages died in Paddington, whereas in the corresponding quarter of the previous year 416 deaths were registered. Scarlatina, which was fatal to 58 children in 1862 destroyed only 19 lives in 1863. The deaths from whooping cough were of equal number in the two quarters; those from measles were fewer in the proportion of 3 to 20, while those attributed to continued fever were more numerous in the proportion of 2 to 1. The excessive mortality of the second quarter (520 deaths in 13 weeks) affords the most remarkable example of the influence of cold in destroying life that I have as yet had occasion to record. On the 4th of January, after a comparatively mild Christmas, a cold, remarkably dry and penetrating wind set in from the north-east, which attained on the following day a velocity of more than ten miles an hour. It rapidly brought down the temperature to 15° below that which usually prevails in the season, and ended in a calm frost, which lasted several days. The influence of this cold atmospheric wave on persons suffering from diseases of the chest was most pernicious. The weekly deaths in London from bronchitis and inflammation of the lungs, rose from 417 to 699, the whole mortality being in excess by 877. In this parish the mortality of the second week of the year was double the average ; during the whole quarter 176 persons died of acute diseases of the lungs, the number of deaths registered from the same causes in 1863 being 84. Among the children of the poor the mortality from these diseases was more than seven times as great as among the well-to-do. Inquests.—During the year ending July 31st, 1863, 1080 inquests were held in the Central District of Middlesex—that is to say, 136 per 100,000 of the population in 1861—a proportion which very nearly corresponds to the average number of inquests held during the four preceding years. In Paddington during the same period the number of inquests amounted to 128, but of these 34 were held on persons brought from other parishes to St. Mary's Hospital. It thus appears that if the whole number be taken into account, 168 inquests per 100,000 were held, or 32 per 100,000 more than in the Central District; but if the imported cases be deducted, the Paddington inquests amount to 124 per 100,000, or 12 less than in the Central District. In 40 of the 128 cases investigated, death was due to natural causes, in 60 to accidents, in 11 to suicide, in 16 to homicide or infanticide, while in one instance no cause could be discovered. Of the 40 deaths from natural causes, 11 occurred in St. Mary's Hospital, 4 only of which were of inhabitants of Paddington. Of the 60 accidental deaths, 39 were in the Hospital, only 8 of them being known to be of residents in Paddington, while 27 were brought there from other parishes; the residences of four cannot be ascertained,being stated neither in the Hospital books, nor in the mortuary returns to the Registrar General. Of 11 suicides, one only was an inhabitant of another parish. Lastly, of 14 infants under one year who were criminally deprived of life, the bodies of two were found in inhabited houses, seven in the open air in streets or gardens, and five in the Canal. Comparing the numbers of inquests of the several classes above referred to, held in Paddington (of inhabitants of the parish) and in the Central District generally, we find that the numbers of inquests held in every 100,000 of the population were as follows:— Central District. Paddington. Deaths from Natural Causes 70.3 43.5 „ Accidents 42.9 43.5 ,, Suicide 8.6 13.2 ,, Infanticide 7.2 18.4 It thus appears that during the year in question fewer inquests were held in Paddington than in the Central District in the proportion of 12 to 13; fewer of deaths by natural causes in the proportion of 10 to 16; more suicides in the proportion of 15 to 10; more infanticides in the proportion of 25 to 10.
