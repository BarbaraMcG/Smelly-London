MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1910. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, Town Hall, Hackney, N.E. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, of the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney. Gentlemen, I beg to present herewith my Nineteenth Annual Report on the Public Health of the Borough of Hackney. The favourable condition of Hackney during the last few years from a health point of view has not only been maintained but further improved during 1910. This year was noted for the extremely low general death rate 12.3 per 1,000 living, that of 1909 being 13.7 per 1,000 living. The infant mortality for the year, which was 99 per 1,000 births, also shows an improvement upon the rate for 1909, the infant mortality rate for this latter year being 108 per 1,000 births. Infectious disease in the Borough also showed a marked decline upon the number notified during the previous year, and the death rate from the seven chief zymotic diseases shows the same improvement, being .8 per 1,000 living as against .9 per 1,000 living during 1909. 6 The above figures relating to the general death-rate, Infant Mortality rate and the Zymotic death-rate show a very substantial and gratifying improvement in the Public Health of the Borough during the year 1910. In the consideration of the health conditions of the Borough it must be borne in mind, that the character of the Borough is gradually changing from a suburban residential to that of an industrial district. In my report for 1909, I stated that there were in the Borough, at the end of that year, 438 factories, 1,311 workshops and 3,263 out-workers. At the end of 1910 these figures had changed to 444 factories, 1,321 workshops and 3,164 out-workers. It is satisfactory to find that, in spite of increasing density and the gradual change from suburban to industrial conditions, the health of the Borough continues to improve. The following table shows the Density of Population, Annual Mortality from all causes and Infant Mortality in the Borough of Hackney, during the 12 years ending 1910. Year. Density. General Death Rate (per 1,000 living). Infantile Mortality Rate (per 1,000 births). 1899 67.5 17.9 165 1900 66.5 17.4 162 1901 66.7 16.6 137 1902 67.3 16.0 121 1903 67.9 14.7 127 1904 68.5 16.0 155 1905 69.1 15.0 140 1906 69.8 14.1 123 1907 70.6 14.4 116 1908 71.0 13.9 117 1909 71.3 13.7 108 1910 72.2 12.3 99 The favourable position occupied by Hackney amongst the London Boroughs may be seen from the subjoined table shewing the Death rates from all causes, and of infants under one year of age, in the Metropolitan Boroughs and City of London during the 52 weeks of 1910, as calculated by the Registrar General.

Further reference is made to the work of this officer in another part of my report. The preventive measures detailed in my report for the year 1909, applicable to pulmonary tuberculosis, have been continued during 1910. As previously explained, they have but a limited effect in diminishing the prevalence of this disease in the Borough. Further steps should now be taken, amongst which the establishment of a tuberculosis dispensary in Hackney occupies the first place. Such an 7 8 institution, properly conducted, would enable us to grapple successfully with this disease; firstly, in ascertaining the full extent of the disease in the Borough ; secondly, by applying curative treatment to existing cases of the disease; and thirdly, by preventing the spread of infection. I am in hopes that during the current year initial steps will be taken to establish such an institution in Hackney. I have pleasure in stating that the officers of the Public Health Department have on the whole carried out the duties entrusted to them to my entire satisfaction. Population and Density.—Applying the rate of increase observed during the last intercensal period to the population of Hackney, I estimate the population of the Borough to be 237,493 at the end of June, 1910. Hackney is thus the sixth largest Metropolitan Borough in point of population. This estimate gives a density of 72.2 persons per acre for the whole Borough, varying from 516 persons per acre in the North Sub-District, to 105.3 persons per acre in the South-West Sub-District. The following table gives the population and density of the Borough and its Sub-Districts, compared with the whole of London. Table.

The annual marriage rate for persons married during this period is therefore 14.3 per 1,000 of the population. The following table gives the number ot marriages, and the marriage rates lor the Borough of Hackney and London for the ten years 1900-1910:— Year. Borough of Hackney. London. Marriages. Marriage Rate. Marriage Rate. 1900 1,684 15.3 18.0 1901 l,756 15.9 17.6 1902 1,668 15.0 17.8 1903 1,695 15.1 17.4 1904 1,710 15.1 17.0 1905 1,714 15.0 16.9 1906 1,770 15.4 17.1 1907 1,906 16.4 17.0 1908 1,996 17.0 15.9 1909 2,036 17.2 15.8 Average 1900—1909 1,793 15.7 17.0 1910 1,700 14.3 16.0 Births.—The number of births registered in the Borough of Hackney during the year 1910 was 5,493 of which 2,761 were males and 2,732 females. The total shows a decline of 209 compared with the number of births registered in the Borough during 1909. The annual birth-rate for Hackney for the year 1910 is therefore 23.1 per 1,000 of the population. The birth-rate for all London for the same period is 23*6 per 1,000 living. As the Notification of Births Act, 1907, has been in operation in the Borough during the * I have here to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. Tom Hosgood, Superintendent Registrar, who has kindly abstracted for me the number of marriages for the year 1910. 10 whole year 1910, I may here record the results obtained. During this period I received 5,464 notifications of birth occurring in Hackney. This includes notification from all sources and also still births. This is equal to 99.5 per cent. of the number registered in the Borough. This result is most satisfactory. I give here a table showing the number of notifications of birth received and giving other details in connection with such notifications. Amongst the births notified, 142 were still-born. This is equivalent to 2 6 per cent, of the total notified. (b) NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS ACT, 1907, Notifications of Births (Live and Stillborn) received during the year, 1910. Year 1910.

Also 17 illegitimate births took place in the Hackney Union Infirmary—the mothers belonging to other districts. Deducting these 253 from the total there remain 119 amongst the population of Hackney during 1910. This is equal to an illegitimate birth-rate of 21 per 1,000 births. The following table gives the birth-rates, &c., for the subdistricts in the Borough : — 11 Table. Births. Registration District of Hackney. Registration Sub-District. All London. North. Central.

On the other hand, there were 450 deaths of Hackney residents in Institutions outside the Borough. Making the necessary corrections by subtracting 503 from and adding 450 to the total 2,878 we obtain the correct number of deaths amongst Hackney residents during 1910, namely 2,822. This total shows a decline of 306 deaths upon the number of deaths registered during 1910. The crude general death-rate from all causes for the year 1910 is therefore 11.8 per 1,000 of the estimated population. On correcting this for age and sex distribution by means of the factor 1.04262, I obtain for the Borough the corrected general death-rate of 12.3 per 1,000 of the population. The corrected general mortality rate for 1909 was 13.7, so the rate for 1910 is 1.4 per 1,000 living less than in the former year. Amongst the sub-districts the death rate was lowest in the north sub-district (10.4 per 1,000) and highest in the south-east sub-district (12.7 per 1,000). Sub-District. Population. No. of Births.

This is a decline of 73 on the number registered during 1909. The infant mortality rate for the year 1910 is therefore 99 per 1,000 births, that for the year 1909 being 108 per 1.000 births. 14 Table V.—INFANTILE MORTALITY. CAUSE OF DEATH.

I was able to make use of voluntary Health Visitors to visit mothers of newly-born infants for the purpose of giving advice on the care and nurture of their infants. The number of such visits made was 197, of which 122 were primary, and 75 were secondary visits. At each first visit a printed leaflet of advice on the care and feeding of infants was left with the mother. In October of the same year the Borough Council appointed a Health Visitor under Section 6 of the London County Council's General Powers Act, 1908. The Health Visitor (Mrs. C. Brown) began her duties on the 21st of November. From that time to the 31st December she made 137 visits to nursing mothers in the Borough. Of these 125 were primary visits and 12 were revisits. The duties of Health Visitors are defined in the Health Visitors (London) Order, 1909. Of the total infantile deaths 34 were due to diarrhoeal complaints, 98 to premature birth, 29 to congenital defects, 117 to those indefinite causes included under the terms, atrophy, debility, marasmus, 22 to tuberculous diseases, 38 to convulsions, 86 to lung diseases and 11 to overlying. Senile Mortality.—The deaths which occurred in the Borough at 65 years and upwards numbered 770, and of these 382 occurred between the ages of 65 and 75 years, 291 between the ages of 75 and 85 years, and 94 were at the ages of 85 years and upwards. The annual mortality rate of persons of 65 years and upwards is 2.4 per 1,000 persons living. Deaths in Public Institutions.—There were 1,278 deaths in public institutions in the Borough during 1910 ; of these 506 were residents of other districts, and the remaining 772 were residents of Hackney. The following lists give the institutions within the Borough, receiving persons both from and without the Borough, and also the institutions outside the Borough receiving sick and infirm persons from the Borough, with the number of deaths in each institution during the year 1910. 17 INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE BOROUGH RECEIVING PERSONS BOTH FROM AND WITHOUT THE BOROUGH.

Notes: Scarlet Fever Diphtheria Enteric 33 SPECIFIC INFECTIOUS OR ZYMOTIC DISEASE. During the year 1910 there were 935 cases of infectious diseases compulsorily notified in the Borough; but 64 of these were subsequently found not to be suffering from infectious disease, thus reducing the total number of genuine cases to 871. This shows a decline of 449 cases on the genuine cases notified during 1909. The attack rate in respect of the notifiable infectious diseases for the year 1910 is, therefore, 3.6 per 1,000 persons living. In addition, there were 242 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis notified under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, and 46 voluntary cases of this disease. The deaths from the seven chief zymotic diseases during the year numbered 190. This is equal to a zymotic death-rate of .8 per 1,000 living persons in the Borough. A—NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Smallpox.—No case of this disease was notified in the Borough of Hackney during the year 1910. Scarlet Fever.—There were 408 notifications of this disease received during the year, but of these 26 were afterwards found not to be suffering from Scarlet Fever, thus reducing the genuine cases of this disease to 382. This is a decline of 368 cases upon the genuine cases notified during 1910. The attack rate for 1910 is therefore 1.18 per 1,000 living. The chart accompanying this report shows the incidence of this disease week by week during the year. It will be seen that the number of cases of Scarlet Fever notified each week was very small throughout the year, only on one occasion did the number exceed 15. The usual Autumnal rise took place, but on a very feeble scale. The number of cases of Scarlet Fever removed to hospital during the year was 359. This is equal to 88 per cent. of the total notified. 34 The following table shows the distribution of Scarlet Fever in the respective sub-districts of the Borough:— Sub-Districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Cases of Scarlet Fever. 109 97 93 109 Attack Rate per 1,000 living. 1.9 1.6 1.4 1.7 It will be seen from the table that Scarlet Fever was nearly evenly distributed over the Borough during the past year, the incidence of the disease being, however, the highest in the North sub-district (1.9 per 1,000) and the lowest in the south-west subdistrict (1.4 per 1,000.) The deaths from this disease numbered five during the year. This is equal to a mortality rate of 12 per 1,000 attacked and .02 per 1,000 living. The mortality for London for scarlet fever for 1910 was .04 per 1,000 living. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup.—There were 189 cases of diphtheria and membranous croup notified during 1910, but of this number 32 were afterwards found not to be so suffering. This reduces the total genuine cases of this disease occurring in the Borough to 157. This is a decrease of 72 on the number notified during 1909, and is equivalent to an attack rate of .66 per 1,000 living. The chart shows the incidence of the disease to have been extremely low during the whole year, in only one week of the year did the total number of cases notified reach the figure 10. The number of cases removed to hospital during the year was 152. This is equal to 80 per cent. of the total. 35 The following table shows the distribution of the cases of this disease in the different sub-districts of the Borough during 1910:— Sub-Districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Cases of Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. 53 36 46 54 Total attack rate per 1,000. .95 .62 .74 .86 From the above it will be noted that this disease was most prevalent during 1910 in the North sub-district (.93 per 1,000), and least prevalent (.62 per 1,000) in the Central sub-district. The deaths from diphtheria and membranous croup during the year numbered eight. This is equal to a mortality rate of 42 per 1,000 ateacked, and .03 per 1,000 living. The death-rate from diphtheria for London during the same period was .09 per 1,000 living. During the year, 167 swabbings from throats of persons suspected to be suffering from diphtheria were bacteriologically examined, 51 of which gave positive and 111 negative results, and 5 were doubtful. DIPHTHERIA ANTI TOXIN. On the 10th August, 1910, the Local Government Board issued an order to Local Authorities in London, which gave them the power to provide, in pursuance of Sec. 77 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, a temporary supply of diphtheria anti-toxin and of medical assistance in connection with the same for the poorer inhabitants of their districts, subject to the conditions that:— "1. The arrangements with respect to the keeping, distribution, and use of the diphtheria antitoxin shall be made in accordance with the advice of the Medical Officer of Health." 2. Any duties of the Medical Officer of Health in connection with this order shall be included within the duties assigned o 2 36 to the Medical Officer of Health bv the Sanitary Officers (London) Order, 1891. 3. The Local Authorities are authorised "to pay from time to time to the Medical Officer of Health, in addition to the salary or other compensation payable" under existing Regulations "a reasonable compensation for all action by the Medical Officer of Health in the execution of this order." The Public Health Committee considered this order and reported thereon to the Borough Council on the 13th October. The Council adopted the recommendation of the Public Health Committee as follows:— "That the Council do avail themselves of the power now given them by providing a supply of anti-toxic serum for the gratuitous use of medical practitioners, both as a prophylactic and a curative agency, amongst the poorer inhabitants in the Borough; and that it be an instruction to the Medical Officer of Health to make arrangements for the keeping, distribution and use of diphtheritic anti-toxin. That in accordance with the suggestion of the Local Government Board, the arrangements which may be made for the supply of diphtheria antitoxin should be brought to the knowledge of all medical practitioners in the Borough, and that at the same time emphasis be laid upon the importance of prompt treatment with anti-toxin, and of the saving of life which may thereby be effected." During 1910 only two bottles of anti-toxin, of 2,000 units each, were issued to medical practitioners in the Borough under this order. Typhoid or Enteric Fever.—The number of cases of enteric fever_notified during 1910 was 64, but of these six were afterwards found not to be suffering from this disease, thus reducing the genuine cases to 58. This is an increase of six cases over the number of genuine cases [notified during] the previous year. The attack 37 rate for 1910 is therefore .24 per 1,000 living. It will be seen from the chart that most of these cases occurred during the latter half of the year. As to the source of infection, it appears that at least 5 cases were contracted whilst on a visit to other districts; and the history of several other cases show that they were infected by personal contact with persons suffering from the disease in the earlier stages; but the source of infection of the bulk of the cases could not be definitely traced. Of the 64 cases notified, 56 were removed to hospital. This is equal to 87 per cent. of the total cases notified. The table below gives the distribution of the cases in the subdistricts of the Borough. Sub-Districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Cases of Typhoid. 16 28 9 11 Attack Rate per 1,000 living. .28 .48 .14 .17 From this table it will be seen that the disease was most prevalent in the North and Central sub-districts. The deaths from Enteric Fever during last year in the Borough numbered 10. This is equal to an annual mortality of 172 per 1,000 attacked and '04 per 1,000 living. During the year specimens of blood from 22 persons suspected to be suffering from this disease were submitted to "Widal's" test. Of these 6 gave a positive and 16 a negative re-action. The mortality for all London for the same period was .04 per 1,000 persons living. Typhus.—No case of this disease was notified in the Borough during 1910. 38 Continued Fever.—No case of continued fever was notified during the year. Puerperal Fever.—There were 15 cases of puerperal fever notified during the year, 9 of which were removed to hospital. The deaths from this disease numbered four. The attack rate for the year was 21 per 1,000 births, and the death rate .72 per 1,000 births. Plague.— No case of Plague occurred in the Borough during last year. Erysipelas.—There were 252 cases of Erysipelas notified during 1910. This is equal to an attack rate of 1.06 per 1,000 living. Of the 252 cases notified, 97 or 38 per cent, of the total were removed to hospital. There were 11 deaths due to Erysipelas, which is equal to a death rate of 43'6 per 1,000 attacked, and "04 per 1,000 living. The following table shows the distribution of the disease in the sub-districts of the Borough:— Sub-Districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Cases of Erysipelas. 9 15 18 55 Rate per 1,000 living. .16 .26 .29 .9 Cerebro Spinal Fever.—There were six cases of this disease notified in the Borough during 1910, of which four were removed to hospital. There were five deaths due to this disease during the same period. Glanders, Anthrax and Hydrophobia in Man.—One fatal case of hydrophobia in man was notified during the year. B.—Non-notifiable Infectious Disease. Influenza.—To this disease were ascribed 34 deaths in Hackney during 1910. This is a decline of 24 upon the number registered 39 during 1909. The mortality rate for the former year is, therefore, .14 per 1,000 living, and for all London .14 per 1,000 living. Chickenpox.—One death was attributed to this cause during 1910. Diarrhoea.—This disease was the cause of 47 deaths, 39 of which occurred under the age of 5 years. This shows a decline of 27 upon the number registered during 1909. There were also 29 deaths ascribed to enteritis, 20 of which occurred in children under the age of 5 years. The annual mortality rate for 1910 is, therefore, .2 per 1,000 living, that for all London being .28 per 1,000 living. The distribution of this disease in the Borough may be seen from the following table:— Sub-Districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Deaths from Diarrhœa. 6 10 14 17 Death Rate per 1,000 living. .11 .17 .22 .27 Measles.—There were 62 deaths in the Borough during 1910 due to this cause, 60 of which were in children under 5 years of age. The total number is an increase of 6 upon the number of deaths during 1909. The mortality rate for 1910 is .26 per 1,000, and that for all London for the same period is .41 per 1,000 living. The following table gives the distribution of the deaths from this disease in the different sub-districts of the Borough:— Sub-Districts. North. Central. South-West. South East. No. of Deaths from Measles. 5 9 30 18 Mortality Rate per 1,000 living. .09 .15 .48 .28 40 During the same period information was received from the head teachers of the public elementary schools of the Borough of 778 cases of measles occurring amongst their scholars or at the homes of their scholars. In each of these cases a leaflet on the prevention of measles was sent to the parent. Whooping Cough.—There were 57 deaths from whooping cough in Hackney during 1910. This is an increase of 6 upon the number occurring during 1909. The mortality rate for 1910 from this disease is, therefore, .24 per 1,000 living. The death rate for all London for the same period is .28 per 1,000 living. The distribution of the disease in the sub-districts of the Borough is given in the following table:— Sub-Districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East No. of Deaths from Whooping Cough. 5 20 11 21 Mortality Rate per 1,000 living. .09 .34 .17 .33 During the year information was received from the head teachers of the public elementary schools in the Borough of 446 cases of whooping cough occurring amongst their scholars, or at the homes of their scholars. CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. Tuberculosis.—During the year 1910 there were 46 cases of pulmonary phthisis voluntarily notified by medical practitioners practising in Hackney. This is a decline of 12 upon the number voluntarily notified during 1909. There were in addition, however, 242 cases notified under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908, which came into operation on the 1st January, 1909 (see page 58 for further report on these notifications). Bacteriological examination of sputa from 128 cases was made during the same period. In 26 of these the specific bacillus of the disease was discovered, in 100 cases the result of examination was 41 negative, and in 2 cases doubtful. The number of deaths from tuberculous disease occurring in Hackney during 1910 was 335, which are classified as follows:— Tuberculous Phthisis 191 Phthisis 66 General Tuberculosis 17 Tuberculous Meningitis 37 „ Peritonitis 12 Tabes Mesenterica 4 Tubercle of other Organs 8 335 This number of deaths gives an annual mortality rate of nearly 1.4 per 1,000 living. The deaths are distributed in the sub-districts of the Borough, as follows:— Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Deaths from Tuberculous Disease. 63 93 83 96 Mortality rate per 1,000 living. 11 1.6 1.3 1.5 Cancer.—To the different varieties of this disease were attributed 222 deaths during 1910. This shows an increase of 8 deaths upon the number registered during 1909. The annual death rate from cancer for the former year is therefore .93 per 1,000 persons living. The deaths are distributed in the sub-districts in the following proportions:— Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Deaths from Cancerous Disease. 66 65 48 43 Mortality rate per 1,000 living. 1.2 1.1 .77 .68 42 Below is given a table showing the number of deaths and death rates in this Borough during the ten years ending 1910:- Borough of Hackney.

During 1910 there were 6 deaths registered as due to acute alcoholic poisoning. In addition there were 20 deaths due to cirrhosis of the liver, a condition caused as a rule by excessive indulgence in alcohol, extending over considerable periods. VACCINATION. The following table gives a summary of the returns made by the vaccination officers of the Borough, respecting the vaccination of children whose births were registered in Hackney from the 1st January to the 30th June, 1910, also supplementary figures for the whole year 1910. During the whole year there were 5,608 births registered in the Borough, of which 2,877. were successfully vaccinated. This is equal to 51.3 per cent. of the total. This is a decline of 6.8 per cent. on the percentage of successful vaccinations made during 1909. During the year 1910 statutory declarations of conscientious objection were received by the vaccination officers to the number of 1,329. This is equivalent almost to 23.7 per cent. of the total number of births. To allow a yearly default in vaccination of nearly 30 per cent. is inevitably to prepare the way for a disastrous outbreak of smallpox in the Borough. For some years the neglect of vaccination has been increasing in the Borough; it cannot be long before a serious outbreak of smallpox takes place, unless means are adopted to enforce vaccination and re-vaccination more thoroughly. 43 Return made by the Vaccination Officers of the Hackney Union, respecting- the Vaccination of Children whose Births were registered in their Districts from 1st January to 30th Jure, 1910, inclusive, together with Supplementary Returns for the Year 1909. Registration Sub-districts comprised in the Vaccination Officer's District. 1 Number of Births returned in the " Birth List "Sheets as registered from 1st Jan. to 30 th June, 1910. 2 Number of these Births duly entered by 31st January, 1911, in Cols.

(а) Complaints of Nuisances.—During the year 1910 there were 1,835 complaints of nuisance, &c., made to the Public Health Department, which were subsequently investigated by the sanitary inspectors of the Borough. About 17 per cent, of these complaints were anonymous, but in almost all cases they received the same consideration as other complaints. Of course, notices were served for the remedy of any defects or nuisances found upon the person or persons responsible under the above Act. (б) Infectious Disease.—The number of houses inspected during the year after infectious disease was much less than during 1909. The total was 953. This is a decrease of 405 upon the number inspected during the preceding year. The sanitary defects or nuisances found were dealt with under the powers conferred by the above Act. (c) House-to-House Inspections.—These are distinct from and in addition to those made under (a) and (6). Owing to the decrease in the number of cases of notifiable disease it has been possible for the inspectors to devote themselves more to house-to-house inspections. The number of such inspections made by the inspectors during the year was 2,354, just 100 more than during 1909. These inspections have not been confined to one part of the Borough, but have been made in all parts of the Borough. Naturally the poorer localities received more attention in this respect, such as Homerton, Hackney Wick, De Beauvoir Town, Spring Hill and London Fields. The nuisance found were dealt with in the same manner as those found under the heading (a) and (6). Nuisances or defects found on inspection were remedied in most cases on the service of intimation notices alone. The total number of such notices served during the year was 3,912. The number of statutory notices was 280 and legal proceedings were initiated in 15 instances. The following details relate to house-tohouse inspections made by the special inspectors appointed for this work:— 45 House-to-House Inspections, 1910.—No. 7 District.

Cowhouses.—The number of licensed cowkeepers in the Borough has further decreased during the past year. At the end of 1910 they numbered 19, with 26 cowsheds. This is a reduction of two licenses and two sheds on the previous year. Inspector Bobbitt reports 251 visits of inspection made to these premises during the year. He served one intimation notice for certain repairs. On the 17th September, 1910, the Public Health Committee made their annual visit to the cowhouses in the Borough. These were found to be in a satisfactory condition, both as to repair and cleanliness, with the exception of two cowhouses, one of which had a defective roof and the other was dirty. The roof was repaired and the necessary cleansing done subsequently on the service of a notice. Dairies and Milkshops.—During the past year 37 milk premises were removed from the register and 26 new milk premises added, thus making the total on the register at the end of last year 351. The proprietors of milk premises have been changed in 113 instances. Inspector Bobbitt made 1,475 visits of inspection to milk premises during the year, and discovered dirty utensils in 21 cases. Dirty and defective premises were discovered in eight instances. The cleansing and repairs were duly effected on the service of notices. Offensive Trades.—There was only one offensive trade premises in Hackney at the end of 1910, i.e., a tripe boiler. Inspector Bobbitt made 17 visits of inspection to these premises during 1910, but did not find it necessary to serve any notice during the year. Slaughter-houses.—There were 21 licensed slaughter-houses in the Borough at the end of 1910. Inspector Bobbitt reports that he made 334 visits of inspection to these premises during 1910. He found nuisances, or defects, on four of these, which were remedied on the service of notices. 49 On the 17th September the Public Health Committee made their annual inspection of the slaughter-houses of the Borough. In two instances the slaughter-houses were found to require limewashing, which was done. All the remaining slaughter-houses were in a satisfactory condition. During Inspector Bobbitt's visits to the slaughter-houses in the Borough he examined the carcases of 205 oxen and 1,705 sheep and lambs. He found the following parts and organs diseased:— 4 forequarters of ox beef affected with tuberculosis. 2 hearts, 2 lungs and 2 heads affected with tuberculosis. Portions of a forequarter bruised. 1 ox liver and lungs with abscess. 7 ox livers with distomatosis. 4 sheep livers with distomatosis. 6 sheep livers and lungs with parasitic cysts. The following statement refers to the milk places, cowsheds, slaughter-houses and offensive trades in the Borough:— Premises. Number of Places. Number of Inspections, 1910. Number of Notices, 1910.

Inspector Bobbitt made 62 visits to these premises during the year and found all the meat used sound and free from disease. D 50 Smoke Nuisances.— During 1910 the Smoke Inspector made 1,145 observations of chimneys of factories, workshops and other places in the Borough. These observations lasted from half an hour upwards. The intimation notices served in connection with this nuisance numbered 37. Water Supply.— Under Section 48 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, there were 49 certificates of proper and sufficient water supply issued to owners of new or rebuilt dwellinghouses in the Borough. These 49 certificates refer to 168 houses and tenements. By-laws for Houses Let in Lodgings.— During the past year the whole of the occupied houses in the Borough registered under the above by-laws were inspected. The following sets out in detail the results of the inspections made, &c.:— HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS REPORT, 1910. No. 7 District.

In the course of inspections of tenement dwellings made in connection with the Customs and Inland Revenue Acts my attention has been drawn to certain rooms in a large number of three and four-roomed tenements in the Borough. These rooms are intended presumably for bedrooms, although they corresponded in structure to a ventilated and lighted box-room. These so-called rooms are small, lighted by an ordinary sash window and provided with a hole in the wall about 6 inches square, which is guarded outside by a grating; but they have no fireplace or chimney flue. I wish to draw attention to the almost wholesale construction of such rooms recently in connection with the building of a large 53 number of tenement dwellings on an estate under development in the Borough. It may be asked by some persons what the objection; are to such rooms. I can best answer this question by stating what I observed on one of my visits. In one particular tenement occupied by a family I was shown the different rooms of the tenement, four in all. In one of these was a young boy in bed, suffering with measles. This room was one of those in question, without a fireplace or flue, but provided with a sash window and a hole in the wall for extra ventilation. The mother informed me she had stopped up the hole in the wall and in order to warm the room had lit an oil stove. The room and the adjoining passages at the time of my visit reeked with the fumes from the combustion of oil. The effect of this vitiated air upon the boy must have been extremely detrimental to his recovery. This particular case illustrates the objections to bedrooms unprovided with fireplaces or flues. The occupants of flats containing one or more of these rooms recognise their uselessness. If the tenant can afford to keep a servant "living in" the room in question is allotted to her as bedroom. The ventilating hole is promptly blocked up on the first appearance of a cold day, and she sleeps at night practically in a closed box through which there is no circulation of air. If the occupier has a family, one or more of the children are put to sleep in the room, the hole in the wall is blocked up, and the same results follow as in the former case; but, being younger, the children suffer more severely from the vitiated air. Sleeping under such conditions would, no doubt, predispose to disease. The curious point about the construction of such living rooms is that it is perfectly legal. In the Building Acts for London there is no mention of bedrooms. Rooms are designated by the title "inhabited rooms" or "living rooms." The term "inhabited" as applied to a room is defined in the London Building Act, 1894, as "a room in which some person passes the night" (or which is 54 used as a living room, including a room with respect to which there is a probable presumption, until the contrary is shown, that some person passes the night therein, or that it is used as a living room). Living rooms are, it will be seen, included in the above definition. The rules for the construction of habitable rooms are set out in Section 70. This section deals with the height of habitable rooms, the provision of windows, their position, size and the portion to open, the floors of basements, rooms, and the provision of ventilation beneath such floors; also the construction of the floors of habitable rooms above stables and the separation of stables from staircases leading thereto. There does not appear to be any obligation to provide any habitable rooms with fireplaces; especially is this the case with bedrooms. This, in my opinion, is a great want in the Building Acts. No better means for the ventilation of habitable rooms can be suggested than a fireplace with flue. In addition to ventilation, means of warming are also required in every bedroom at certain times of the year and at other times in case of illness. Some of the rooms now provided in tenement dwellings are, in my opinion, totally unfit for use, either as living or bedroom . CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACT, 1890. Under the provisions of the above Act three applications were made to me during the year by owners of tenement properties to inspect the same with the view to granting certificates that the tenements were so constructed "as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons dwelling therein, and that due provision is made for their sanitary requirements," for the purpose of claiming exemption from Inhabited House Duty. The three applications had reference to twelve tenements. Under Section 35 of the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, applications were made by the proprietors of four common lodging-houses 55 in the Borough for the inspection of their lodging-houses for the same purpose as above. Certificates were granted for the whole of above properties after all necessary alterations had been made. CANAL BOATS ACTS, 1877-1894. The Canal Boats Inspector reports that he made 81 visits to the waterways in the Borough during 1910, and inspected 48 canal boats. No infringements of the Acts or Regulations referring to canal boats were observed on either of these inspections. ICE CREAM VENDORS. At the end of 1910 there were 159 ice cream vendors in the Borough of Hackney, an increase of 21 on the number present at the end of 1909. The total number of inspections of these premises made during last year was 248. Defects were found in 28 of these premises, which were remedied on the service of intimation notices. GLANDERS AND FARCY ORDER, 1907. During 1910 I received notification from the Veterinary Inspectors of the London County Council of six cases of glanders in animals in the Borough of Hackney under the above order. In each case I had the premises inspected and made enquiries respecting the health of the stablemen &c., but in no case did it appear that the disease had been conveyed to human beings. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACTS, 1890-1903. No representation was made to the Local Authority under the above Acts during 1910. HOUSING AND TOWN PLANNING ACT, 1909. On the 2nd June, 1910, the Borough Council, on a report from the Public Health Committee respecting the delegation of powers 56 under this Act, adopted the following resolution, "excepting the making or determining of a closing order ":— "That the Public Health Committee be empowered to enforce within the Borough the provisions of Sections 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 36 and 43 of the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909, and to proceed without submitting their proceedings for the approval of the Council in all matters relating to the serving and receiving of notices and taking legal proceedings, and otherwise to execute the powers conferred upon the Borough Council by the before-mentioned sections of the Act." On the 10th September the Local Government Board issued an order and circular letter prescribing Housing Regulations made under Section 17 (1) of the above Act. This order and letter were referred to the Public Health Committee for report. After due consideration the Committee submitted the following resolutions to the Council for their approval:— (1) That a house-to-house inspection continue to be made of such dwelling-houses in the Borough which in the opinion of the Medical Officer of Health it is desirable should be inspected from time to time. We do not attempt at present to fix the intervals between such inspections, but leave that question open for the Committee to determine hereafter. (2) That the Medical Officer of Health, in accordance with Article I., prepare lists of dwelling-houses in the Borough, the early inspection of which in his opinion is desirable. (3) That the two sanitary inspectors now engaged on house-to-house inspection, and as many of the district inspectors in the intervals of their routine work so far as this will not clash with or impede the necessary sanitary work of the Borough be detailed for the inspections referred to, acting under the immediate supervision and direction of the Medical Officer of Health. 57 (4) That the Medical Officer of Health obtain the necessary books, &c., for keeping a complete record of the inspections made, and any action taken by the local authority thereon. (5) That the Committee take into consideration once a month in accordance with Article IV. the records kept in pursuance of Article III. of the Regulations. These resolutions were approved of and adopted by the Borough Council on the 27th October. THE RIVER LEA. Owing to the low atmospheric temperature of the summer months of 1910, there was an absence of complaints of nuisance from this river, but in the month of June I had a sample of the river water taken and submitted to the public Analyst for chemical examination. Below is a copy of his report. REPORT ON A SAMPLE OF WATER. Received from the Hackney Borough Council on June 16th, 1910:— Sample Mark—River Lee. Particulars of Source—River Lee at foot of Little Hill, Upper Clapton. Physical Examination. Suspended Matter—Considerable. Appearance of a Column two feet in length—Opaque, light yellowish brown.

During the year 1910, there were 242 cases of tuberculosis notified to me under these Regulations. Many of the cases were notified more than once. The following table gives the ages and sex of these cases:— 59 Ages and Sex of Notified Cases. Ages Under 15 years. 15 to 25 years. 25 to 35 years. 35 to 45 years. 45 years and upwards. Totals.

As a matter of fact, the number of times a case was notified during the year varied from one to six, as follows:— No. of times case notified. 1 2 3 4 5 6 Total. No. of Cases 116 88 22 5 8 3 242 Of this number again, 14 were notified from the Workhouse and Casual Wards. Of the 242 cases notified under the above Regulations, 83 died during the year, 75 in the Infirmary and 8 at their homes. The total number of deaths from this disease in the whole Borough during the same period was 257. Enquiries, which were made into the circumstance, surrounding and habits of life of cases notified during 1909 were continued during 1910. Of the total notified, I was able to obtain information in respect of 205 cases. The information obtained may be classified under the following heads:—(a) Occupations; (b) Housing accommodation; (c) Sleeping arrangements; (d) Precautions respecting expectoration; (e) As to the use of separate eating and drinking utensils; (f) Ventilation of bedroom. (a) Occupations.— Information as to present or past occupations was obtained in the case of 48 females and 104 males. Of the females 11 were engaged at home in domestic work, 8 were domestic servants 4 were engaged in laundry work, 4 in boot machine work, 4 in charing, 3 in confectionery, 2 in mantle making, 2 in blouse making; 60 2 were factory hands and 1 worked at each of the following businesses, viz.:—millinery, hair-brush making, packing, book-keeping, stationery work, nursing, tailoring and tie-making. Of the 104 males, 11 were or had been engaged in different branches of the boot and shoe trade, 8 were labourers, 5 plumbers and gasfitters, 5 cabinet-makers, 4 soldiers, 4 carmen, 3 clerks, 3 hawkers, 3 porters, 3 glass workers, 3 leather workers; 2 were or had been engaged in each of the following occupations, viz.:— plasterer, compositor, painter, pianoforte maker, rubber worker, carpenter, book binder, polisher, bricklayer, traveller, barman; and 1 each was engaged as button turner, newspaper salesman, postman, trunk maker, general dealer, omnibus cleaner, warehouseman, sailor, window cleaner, knife machine maker, baker, farrier, book publisher, dustman, manservant, decorator, box-maker, hairdresser, policeman, harness maker, packer, tailor, tent maker, litho artist, hat maker, housebreaker. (b) Housing Accommodation.— Information under this head was obtainable in respect of 133 cases notified. Patients occupying One Room.— There were 14 patients, each of whom lived alone in one room. There were also two cases in which each patient shared the single room with one other person; and there were four patients each sharing the room with two other persons. Patients occupying Two Rooms.— There were four patients, each of whom occupied two rooms above. There were 13 patients, each of whom shared the accommodation with two other persons; 10 with three other persons; 12 with four other persons; 8 with five other persons, and 4 with six other persons. Patients occupying Three Rooms.— Two patients occupied these alone; 7 shared the accommodation with two other persons; 15 with three other persons; 7 with four other persons; 13 with five other persons; 5 with six other persons; 4 with seven other persons; 4 with eigth other persons; 4 with nine other persons; 1 with ten other persons. 61 Patients occupying Four Rooms.— Three patients used this accommodation alone; 2 shared it with two other persons; 6 with three other persons; 7 with four other persons; 5 with five other persons; 10 with six other persons; 1 with seven other persons; 1 with eight other persons; 1 with nine other persons; 1 with ten other persons and 1 with eleven other persons. Patients occupying Five Rooms.— One patient shared the five rooms with two other persons; 1 with three others; 1 with four others; 2 with five others; 3 with six others and 1 with seven other persons. (c) Sleeping Arrangements.— Enquiry under this head showed that of 186 cases there were only 78 who occupied their bedrooms alone and 108 occupying bedrooms in common with other persons. Of these 108 persons, 78 shared their bedrooms with one other person only; 21 with two others; 6 with three others; 1 with four others and 2 with five other persons. Further, of the 186 cases, 103 occupied the bed alone and 83 shared their bed with others; 79 persons having one other occupant of their bed and 4 persons two other occupants. (d) Precautions respecting Expectoration.— Information under this head was obtainable in 182 cases. Of this number 78 used no receptacle for sputa either at home or out of doors, 80 made use of some receptacle at home only and 24 used a spit-cup both at home and out of doors. (e) Precautions as to Use of Separate Eating and Drinking Utensils.— On enquiry it was found that of 177 tuberculous patients 98 stated that they had such separate utensils reserved for their use alone, and 79 stated that no separate utensils were so reserved. (f) Ventilation of Bedrooms.— In almost all cases in which enquiry was made ventilation appeared to have been provided in the form of fireplaces and windows made to open; but it is doubtful if it is maintained except in a few instances. I find that those young patients who have been in a sanatorium if only for a short time know the value of fresh air in this disease, and usually maintain the ventilation of the bedrooms both day and night. 62 Measures taken during the year.— In general these were the same as those specified in my report for the year 1909. One of the greatest aids to the prevention of the spread of this disease would no doubt be a tuberculosis dispensary in the Borough. This question has been raised, and there is some prospect of such an institution being established in the Borough either by voluntary means or by the Borough Council. On enquiry of the Clerk to the Guardians as to the hospital accommodation provided at the Infirmary for cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, I have received the following letter:— HACKNEY UNION. Clerk's Offices, Sidney Road, Homerton, N.E. 19th June, 1911. Dear Sir,—In reply to your letter of the 17th instant, I beg to inform you that in the Infirmary of this Union two wards for males and one ward for females accommodating 28, 29 and 30 patients respectively, are set apart for cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis only. Adult cases of Tuberculosis are also sent by the Guardians to the Seaside Sanatoria, Sandgate, and on the 31st December last there were one male and four females at that establishment chargeable to this Union. The Metropolitan Asylums Board also receive children suffering from Tuberculosis at the following establishments, viz.:— Queen Mary's Hospital for Children, at Carshalton; Millfield, Rustington; St. Anne's Home, Heme Bay; and East Cliff House, Margate; and on the 29th April last there were 43 cases thereat chargeable to this Union.

Of the above, 702 were workshops in which articles of wearing apparel are manufactured, altered or prepared for sale, &c., and 337 in which other articles are manufactured, &c. Below is given a list of these two classes of workshops and the occupations carried on therein. Amongst the workshops manufacturing wearing apparel there are 475 where female labour alone is employed, and 140 where both male and female labour is employed, and 87 where male labour alone is employed. There are 42 domestic workshops in the Borough, in 28 of which females alone work, and 14 in which both males and females work. In workshops and places of other occupations females alone are employed in 110, both sexes in 62, and males alone in 165. Thus in the total number of workshops and workplaces registered in the Borough females alone are employed in 585, both sexes in 202, and males alone in 252. During the year notices and complaints were received from H.M.

In connection with these inspections 272 intimation and statutory notices were served for the abatement of the nuisances found. The following table gives further details relating to the inspection of workshops in the Borough. E 2 68 NUISANCES IN WORKSHOPS, 1910. Outstanding at end of 1909. Found in 1910.

The names and addresses of these were forwarded to their respective local authorities, as given in the following list:— Bethnal Green 691 Barking 2 Stepney 204 Southwark 5 Tottenham 80 Edmonton 5 Camberwell 45 East Ham 10 Gillingham 1 Kensington 1 Hornsey 7 Croydon 2 Bermondsey 16 St. Marylebone 1 Wood Green 4 Poplar 222 Woodford 1 Stoke Newington 132 East Wickham 1 Woolwich 1 Shoreditch 418 Chiswick 3 Leyton 89 St. Pancras 10 Romford 1 Willesden 4 Hammersmith 4 Greenwich 1 Westcliff 2 Wandsworth 6 Chingford 3 Bishops Stortford 1 Ealing 1 Battersea 2 Brentford 1 Ilford 2 West Ham 26 Westminster 2 Finsbury 24 Gt. Missenden 2 Wathamstow 164 St. Albans 1 Islington 202 City of London 1 Deptford 4 Finchley 1 2,408 Teddington 2 71 During the year 1910 Miss Portlock (the Inspector appointed for the inspection of outworkers' premises) made 1,256 inspections and 852 re-inspections. She also made 1,099 visits without inspection, the outworkers either having moved or being deceased (496), or having given up work (118), or being out (319), or owing to a wrong address being given (72), or the premises being workshops (54), or male workers only being employed (40). During Miss Portlock's inspections she discovered 649 sanitary defects. For the abatement of these she served 452 intimation notices and 58 final notices. She also discovered 26 workshops. Of the 1,256 premises inspected by Miss Portlock in 84 only was a room set apart entirely for work. In the remainder work was carried on in rooms used for other purposes, as set out below:— Workroom, bedroom and kitchen 87 „ „ living room 15 „ and kitchen 790 „ „ bedroom 179 „ „ living room 89 „ „ scullery 9 „ „ shop 2 „ „ landing 1 Total 1,172 The following table gives the general character of the nuisances found with other details:— 72 NUISANCES IN OUTWORKERS' PREMISES, 1910.

(a) During the year 1910 there were 1,512 rooms fumigated and 585 rooms cleansed in Hackney by the staff of the Public Health Department. In these totals is included the disinfection after cases of phthisis, measles, and whooping cough. The fumigation and cleansing done each month is set out in the following table:— Number of Rooms Fumigated and Cleansed each Month during 1910. Month. Rooms Fumigated. Rooms Cleansed. Remarks. January 134 47 The method of fumigation is by burning sulphur. After fumigation the rooms to be cleansed are stripped of their wall-paper and cleansed with a solution of carbolic acid. The ceilings are afterwards whitened.

This number was 1,812 less than during 1909. The diminution was of course due to the diminished number of cases of scarlet fever and diphtheria in the Borough during the year as compared with the previous year. 74 Articles Disinfected during the Year 1910.

During the year 1910, there were only 34 persons admitted to the Shelter whilst their homes were being disinfected. This total consisted of 8 men, 9 women and 17 children. This shows an increase of one person on the number admitted during 1909. The cost of maintenance for the 34 persons admitted last year was £3 17s. 0d. The average duration of stay in the shelter was 1.5 days. The table on page gives further particulars relating to these contacts. No expenses were incurred in the conveyance of persons to and from the shelter during last year. CLEANSING OF PERSONS ACT, 1897. The facilities afforded by the Borough Council under the above Act for the cleansing of verminous persons were taken advantage of during 1910 by 568 persons who presented themselves at the station for cleansing. The following shows the number of baths given to persons affected with vermin since the baths were instituted:— Year. 1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 1907 1908 1909 1910 No. of Baths 3 11 9 241 330 457 724 667 568 Of the total 568 baths given, 106 were sulphur baths for scabies and 462 for pediculi. Amongst the number presenting themselves for baths, the great majority were children from the public elementary schools. They amounted to a total of 352, a considerable decline upon the number of children cleansed during 1909. 83 Schools. No. Cleansed. Schools. No. Cleansed. Hot Baths. Sulphur Baths. Hot Baths.

The quantity of house refuse removed from occupied houses in the Borough to the Destructor by the Council's contractors during the year 1910, amounted to 39,481 tons 11 cwts. 3 qrs. and 14 lbs. From the North Division 18,136 tons 9 cwts. 1 qr. 14 lbs., and from the South Division 21,345 tons 2 cwts. 2 qrs. were removed at the rate of 4s. 5d. per ton, and a total cost of £8,718 16s. l0d. The quantity of house refuse removed during 1910 shows an increase upon that removed during 1909 to the extent of 264 tons. The total cost, however, has only increased £10 17s. l0d. This is due to the fact that the contract price for removal for the whole year was 4s. 5d. per ton, whilst during the first quarter of 1909 the contract price for removal was 4s. 6d. The cost of disposal of the house refuse removed to the destructor during 1910, which includes the destruction of the refuse by fire and the disposal of clinker arising from the refuse, together with tins and other non-combustible material, has been estimated by the Borough Electrical Engineer at the rate of 35.69 pence per ton, the total cost for destruction being £5,871 2s. This total is £66 9s. l1d. less than that for the year 1909. The total cost both for removal and destruction of the house refuse of the Borough during 1910 is, therefore, £14,589 18s. 10d., being £56 0s. 9d. less than the total expenditure during 1909 for the removal and disposal of house refuse.

KING-WARRY, m.d., d.p.h., Medical Officer of Health. 99 APPENDIX. REPORT OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. On the Purveyors of Milk in the Borough of Hackney and Section 5 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908. To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, By section 5 (1) of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, it is provided that any Sanitary Authority may remove from their Register of Cowkeepers, Dairymen or Purveyors of Milk, or may refuse to enter upon such register, the name of any person carrying on the trade of dairyman or purveyor of milk upon premises which are in the opinion of the Sanitary Authority unsuitable for the sale of milk therein. By section 5 (2) provision is made for appeal to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction by any person aggrieved by any decision of a Sanitary Authority under the provisions of this Section, and the court may make an order on the Sanitary Authority requiring such Authority to enter upon or restore the name of such to the Register. In order that the Public Health Committee may be in a position to consider the advisability of applying the above section to the dairyman and purveyors of milk in the Borough of Hackney, I have had an inspection made of the premises where these trades are carried on in the Borough, and I beg herewith to report upon the same. But before considering the suitability of premises in relation to the milk trade, it is necessary to fix some standard of suitability or fix some principles by which the Committee may be guided when considering the question of removal of names from the Register. g 2 100 In considering this question regard should be paid to the structure of the premises, and to the liability of contamination of the milk, that is— 1. The lighting and ventilation should be adequate. 2. The room used for sale or storage of milk should not communicate directly with a sleeping or living room. 3. There should not be any drain inlet in such room. 4. Efficient means, including a plentiful supply of water, should be provided for properly cleansing the milk vessels. 5. Milk should not be placed where it is liable to be contaminated by particles of dust or effluvia given off by particles sold on the same premises, or even in the same shop, e.g., coals, vegetables, paraffin oil, fish, &c. 6. Efficient means should be provided for keeping the milk covered. 7. Every precaution should be adopted to prevent milk being contaminated in any way. 8. The premises and utensils should be kept in a satisfactory state of cleanliness. All milk vendors should at least in my opinion satisfy the Committee on these points before being registered. With regard to the present dairymen and purveyors of milk in the Borough, I find that there is a total of 329 on the Register. These, on the average, supply daily the quantities of milk as set out:— Quantity of Milk. Under 2 Quarts. 2 to 4 Quarts. 1 to 2 Gallons. 2 to 4 Gallons. 4 to 8 Gallons. 8 to 16 Gallons. Above 16 Gallons. No. of Purveyors 23 81 92 49 21 16 62 101 They may be further classified as follows:— 1. Dairies proper. 2. Dairies in which provisions are sold together with milk and dairy products. 3. Purveyors of milk in connection with general stores. 4. Purveyors of milk from private dwellings. (a) Selling on round only. (b) Selling milk both on a round and on the premises. 5. Others. 1. This class consists of purveyors of milk selling only milk and milk products from a properly arranged dairy. Their number is 36 and of these 19 keep cows. Of this class generally it may be said that the premises are suitable" for the sale of milk therein." 2. This class numbers 70 and consists of purveyors of milk carrying on in conjunction with the sale of milk, the sale of provisions. The milk is usually kept in the shop on a counter and more or less covered, where other articles are exposed for sale. In the case of this class of milk sellers, the milk is not exposed to any effluvia which would confer unpleasant taste or noxious properties to the milk. There is some risk of particles of dust of different kinds finding their way into the milk unless the receptacle is kept covered. 3. This class of purveyor which numbers 198 constitutes the bulk of those selling milk in the Borough. The articles sold in conjunction with milk in the same shop are sometimes oilman's goods, including paraffin oil, &c. In fact, this class of purveyor needs very careful individual consideration as to whether the conditions under which milk is stored and sold on these premises are suitable. Out of 198 vendors in this class not less than 129 sell paraffin oil, either on the same premises or in close proximity to the milk in the shop. In addition many other articles are sold in these shops which give 102 rise to effluvia, or to the formation of dust. Amongst the former may be mentioned fish and vegetables, such as onions; amongst the latter coal, potatoes, hearthstone, whiting, &c. 4. This class includes vendors carrying on the milk trade in connection with a private residence, i.e., the milk is not sold in a shop. Amongst these vendors are those who sell milk only on a round and not on the premises. The number of these is 10. Others in this class sell milk both on rounds and also on the premises. Of these there are 14. The private premises of this class of milk vendor requires very careful scrutiny before deciding as to their suitability for the business of milk vendor. 5. The fifth class of vendors is a very miscellaneous lot. The total number included amounts to 16, and these have shops in which are carried on the following businesses in addition to that of milk selling, viz.:— Confectionery, sweets and mineral waters 1 Tea, coffee, ice creams and mineral waters 1 Tobacco, ice creams and mineral waters 2 Sweets and mineral waters 1 General refreshments 3 General newspapers, &c., and sweets 3 Beer (off-license), paraffin oil and general stores 1 Beer (off license) and groceries 4 The premises of each of these must, I am of opinion, be carefully examined before admitting them to the privilege of registration. Taking these five classes of milk vendors in the order I have mentioned them, I am of opinion—that the purveyors included in Class 1, which consist of dairies proper, may be registered without any restriction except that proper provision shall be taken where necessary to keep the milk on the premises properly covered. The vendors in Class 2 may also be registered as suitable, with the same reservation as that applied to Class 1. 103 With respect to Class 3, I am of opinion that these should not be registered unless (a) the articles capable of giving off dusty particles and effluvia be removed from the shop in which the milk is kept or sold, and (b) unless the milk is kept properly covered (preferably with a metallic covering). In Class 4, we have firstly those vendors selling milk only on rounds. Careful enquiry should be made in each of these cases, and registration should not be made unless the storage place for the cans and milk utensils is in every way satisfactory, and that proper provision is made for the thorough cleansing of these cans and utensils. With regard to those vendors in connection with private premises who sell both on their rounds, and also from their private residences these should not be registered unless (a) the place from which the milk is sold is entirely cut off from any living or sleeping room, and from any common passage in the house; (b) unless the storage place for milk, and milk utensils is in every way satisfactory; (c) unless provision is made for the thorough cleansing of cans and utensils; (d) and unless the milk kept on the premises be properly covered (preferably with a metal cover). As regards the fifth class the principle of protecting the milk from effluvia and dirty and other undesirable particles should be applied here also. Means for the storage of milk and proper cleansing of milk utensils should be insisted upon. I have specified the vendors of this class in the Borough separately as the Committee may prefer to consider them individually. I am, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, J. KING WARRY, M.D., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health. 104 House-to-House Inspection. To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, In reporting on the above reference it is my duty in the first place to point out that in my Annual Report to the Borough Council for the year 1908 certain figures occur relating to House-to-House inspection made during that year in the Borough. They occur in the tabular statement on page 90-91 of the Report, headed "Register of Sanitary Work, 1908," and are as follows:— House-to-House Inspection. Totals. Number of Inspections 1,554 Defects Discovered 1,278 The proportion of defects discovered to the total inspections made amounts to 82 per cent., and it is because of the large percentage of defects discovered that the attention of the Public Health Committee is drawn to the subject. The reference uses the term "nuisance" in lieu of "defects," as used in my Report. It is difficult to give an exact definition of the term "nuisance," but there is implied in the term as originally used the idea of danger or injury to health. This has been extended in recent years to include any condition interfering with the comfort or convenience of individuals. Bearing this in mind, I have preferred to confine the term "nuisance" to the idea of conditions either actually dangerous or injurious to health; and as the house-to-house inspections above referred to revealed conditions shading off from those actually threatening health, to others interfering with the comfort or convenience of individuals, and some only in a small degree, I considered it better to use the more general term "defects" when detailing the result of such inspections. 105 The motion referred to above has evidently been drafted on the assumption that the 82 per cent. of defects found were conditions dangerous or injurious to the health of the inmates of the houses inspected. From the following table of the conditions actually found it will be seen that they represent all degrees of nuisance and all degrees of discomfort. Amongst the former I should include defective drains or choked drains, defective soil pipes or w.c., pans, dampness and high degrees of over-crowding. The following represent a lesser degree of nuisance, of course, regard being paid to the extent of the nuisance, viz., defective roofs, gutters and rainwater pipes, deficient water supply to the w.c., insufficient ventilation to w.c. in a dwelling, no through ventilation under ground floor. The following may be nuisances or only discomforts depending on their degree, viz., untrapped sink wastes, defective sink wastes, defective yard paving or undrained yard, defective washhouse paving, no dustbin, dirty houses or parts, water cisterns without covers, w.c. pans dirty, defective dustbins, and so on. It must also be borne in mind that the last conditions may be so extensive as to be really dangerous or injurious to health, but this is exceptional. It will be seen from the above that a large part of the defects found was the result of wear and tear, which might occur in course of time in any dwelling, the conditions actually injuring or threatening to injure health forming quite a small proportion of the whole. It is further assumed in the reference that, inasmuch as 82 per cent. of defects were found in the house-to-house inspections of last year, a similar proportion of defects would be found to exist in all the small class of property (assessed under £15 a year) of the Borough. This assumption by no means follows for the following reasons:— The house-to-house inspections in the Borough are not undertaken in a haphazard way. The dwellings selected for such inspection are those which I have reason to believe have either not been inspected and put in repair for some years, or from evidence from 106 various sources require inspection. So that the dwellings inspected under the head "house-to-house" were suspected as being in an insanitary condition—in a worse condition than others of the same class. For this reason I do not think anything like the same proportion of defects would be found in all dwellings in the Borough assessed at £15 and under as was found in the 82 per cent. referred to above. I have made enquiries of the Borough Accountant as to the number of dwellings assessed at £15 and under, and am informed the number would be about 7,000. To make an annual inspection of this number of dwellings in the Borough, in addition to the many other duties carried out by the inspectorial staff, would, in my opinion, be impossible, without some increase in the number of inspectors. With the information at present at my disposal I should say such an annual inspection would necessitate the appointment of at least two additional inspectors to the permanent staff. The reference also leaves it open to the Committee to consider as an alternative to the annual inspection of all dwellings assessed at £15 and under "whether any other action should be adopted." To take a certain assessment as a guide for the selection of dwellings to be annually inspected does not appear to me to be the best means of ascertaining the dwellings most in need of inspection. If the Committee desire to extend the house-to-house inspection in the Borough beyond what is already done I think the better plan would be to apply the by-laws for houses let in lodgings, which have been adopted by the Council, more extensively than hitherto. These by-laws may apply to unfurnished tenements which are let at a weekly rental under 7s. per week. It is necessary in the first place that particulars as to rental, &c., of the selected dwellings shall be obtained before being registered by the Local Authority. When registered the dwellings become subject to the by-laws, which insures a yearly inspection. I am of opinion that the present number of houses let in lodgings, which are registered under the 107 by-laws, might easily be raised to 1,000 without any additional appointment of inspectors or any detriment to the other duties carried out by the inspectorial staff.
