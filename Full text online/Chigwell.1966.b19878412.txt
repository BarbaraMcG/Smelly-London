This report is compiled in accordance with the Public Health Regulations 1959 and Ministry of Health Circular 1/67. There were several new developments during the year of benefit to the health and welfare of the population. I would mention particularly the extensions and improvements which the Council has recently provided at its recreational centre at Grange Farm, Chigwell. These include greatly improved accommodation, water supplies, kitchen and catering facilities. Also at Grange Farm, the W.R.V.S. Winged Fellowship continued to provide their wonderful holiday service for severely handicapped persons, and I was happy to assist them when in doubt as to the suitability of applicants. These included many paralysed persons, spastics and advanced cases of arthritis, requiring the maximum amount of nursing and care. No less than 430 guests were given a fortnight's holiday during the season. On an adjoining site, Chigwell House, the Essex County Council's new residential and day centre for physically handicapped persons came into being and was officially opened by Her Royal Highness the Princess Margaret. Other innovations have been the introduction by the Essex County Council of Cervical Cytology Screening Tests and the establishment of a Child Guidance Clinic - both at Loughton Hall Clinic; also the formation by the Family Planning Association of an independent committee and organisation for their clinic at Loughton, on which I accepted an invitation to be a co-opted member. VITAL STATISTICS The health of the population continues to be satisfactory. The birth-rate for the District (13.6 per 1000) continues to be considerably less than the comparable rate for the United Kingdom (17.4 per 1000) due allowance having been made in these figures for local differences in age and sex distribution from the national average. Both locally and nationally the birth rates have fallen since last year by approximately 4%, and one may speculate as to what extent this may be due to the increasing use of "The Pill" and to the opening of new Family Planning Clinics. /The -3- The standardised death rate (11.2 per 1000} is slightly more than last year (10.7), mainly due to more bronchitis, pneumonia and heart disease deaths over the age of 65. There were 9 fatal motor vehicle accidents and 10 other accidental deaths (2 more of each than last year), the circumstances being too varied to permit of any useful comment. By way of compensation, however, there was a further reduction in the death rate of infants under the age of 1 year, which at 13.1 per 1000 live births compares very favourably with the national average of 19.0. Again there were no maternal deaths from childbirth or abortion, and the overall standardised death rate in the District from all causes at 11.2 per 1000 population is below the national average of 11.7. control of infectious diseases Control of infectious diseases remains highly satisfactory. Only 7 such cases were admitted to hospitals during the year, and there were no deaths from these causes. 3,230 international vaccination certificates required by persons travelling abroad were scrutinised and authenticated in the Department, in accordance with Ministry of Health Regulations. 6 persons arriving in the country from endemic smallpox areas without valid certificates of vaccination were kept under surveillance. HEALTH EDUCATION The efforts of the Public Health Department to provide education and information to the public on health matters are considered to be one of their most important functions, and have been pursued on all appropriate occasions during the year. By courtesy of the Co-operative Permanent Building Society, we were able to put on a window display on Accident Prevention at their premises in High Road, Loughton, for 2 weeks in June. This was supported by letters in the local newspapers and the distribution of leaflets in doctors' waiting rooms, the Council Offices, old people's clubs, and by health visitors, home helps, W.R.V. S., and other voluntary workers. Also during the year, I accepted invitations to speak on public health measures to the Loughton Round Table, Debden Senior Citizens' Club, the Young Liberals, and to kitchen staff, teachers and children in several schools. Local organisations and individual members of the public tend increasingly to 'phone, visit or write to the Public Health Department for advice and information, and this is welcomed. /Re-housing -4- RE-HOUSING PRIORITY ON MEDICAL GROUNDS 90 requests for priority for re-housing on medical grounds were referred to me for assessment, usually supported by a doctor's written certificate. Each case was fully investigated and my recommendations were as follows:- Diseases or Conditions Total Applicants Priority Recommended Priority Not recommended Asthma, bronchitis, catarrhal diseases etc. 19 6 13 Blood pressure 2 0 2 Heart disease 12 9 3 Nervous disease (anxiety states, neurasthenia, neurosis etc.) 20 10 10 Rheumatism 12 10 2 Tuberculosis 1 1 0 Other diseases 7 3 4 Other conditions 17 7 10 90 46 44 Figures for 1962 were 86 34 52 " " 1963 " 110 34 76 " " 1964 " 113 49 64 " " 1965 " 89 46 43 The 44 applicants not recommended for medical priority include (1) Illness not aggravated by housing conditions; (2) Temporary indispositions; (3) Those pleading the discomforts of overcrowding and structural defects (i.e. grounds other than medical; (4) Repeated requests already assessed. /SECTION -5- SECTION 47, NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, AND NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951 AND 1962 No formal action was considered necessary during the year. 15 persons in possible need of care and attention were investigated. 4 cases were voluntarily removed to appropriate accommodation either in hospitals or homes for the elderly; the remainder were kept under observation at home with the services of the district nurse, home help and meals-on-wheels, where necessary, all of which were much appreciated. MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF STAFF I examined 41 officers and staff of the Chigwell Urban District Council and 16 officers and staff of the Essex County Council on appointment for duties in the District; also 4 Chigwell Urban District Council and 3 Essex County Council staff were assessed and reported on for sick-pay and superannuation purposes, following prolonged periods of sick-leave or retirement. Before concluding this summary, I would like to place on record my appreciation of the high standard of co-operation and understanding which has developed over the years between all those who play a part in providing health and welfare services in the District. It might have been expected that the reorganisation of local government boundaries which took place in the Greater London Area in 1965 would result in a period of confusion and lack of co-ordinated effort. That this has not occurred is largely due to the good personal relationships which already existed between many officials and voluntary workers in this and neighbouring areas. Dr. Yule and his staff at the recently constituted West Essex Area Health Department of the Essex County Council have been particularly helpful in this transitional period, and by lending support to the formation and activities of a "Chigwell Social Workers' Club" have enabled numerous official and voluntary workers in all spheres of the social, educational, welfare and health service to meet each other at regular intervals and discuss matters of common interest. The experience and contacts I have gained through my membership of the Management Committee of the South Ockendon Group of Hospitals have also been of much help to me in dealing with the problems of the mentally handicapped and their families. Finally, I would once again like to express my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their support, and to the staff of the Department for their continued enthusiasm and loyalty. To all who have provided me with statistical and other information for inclusion in this report, my grateful acknowledgements are also made. H.

Hospital services are provided by the North-East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board at the Forest Hospital, Buckhurst Hill, and at hospitals in neighbouring districts, HEALTH CENTRES: The County Council has three Health Centres serving the District, as follows:- BUCKHURST HILL: Essex County Council Clinic, Buckhurst Way (01,504,5180) LOUGHTON; Essex County Health Services Clinic, Loughton Hall, Rectory Lane (01.508.6295/9) Essex County Health Services Clinic, The Drive (01.508.5776) -14- /At At each of these centres there are clinic sessions for expectant mothers, infants, school children etc., and details of these may be had on application to the centre or to the Council Offices. Each centre has two or more health visitors or school nurses who call upon mothers in their own homes in addition to giving advice at the centres. In addition to the above, infant welfare centres are also held at the following:- CHIGWELL: St. Winifred's Hall, Manor Road. The Manse, Chigwell Row. LOUGHTON: Roding Road Church Hall. SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICE: The following extracts from the Annual Report of the School Medical Officer for the West Essex Division are of interest:- "Whatever the future development of the service, its success or failure will always depend to a large extent on the relationships between the people concerned, the teaching staff, in particular the Headmaster or Headmistress, the School Medical Officer and School Nurse, the General Practitioner and the Hospital and Local Authority specialist services, and most important, the child and his parents. I am pleased to report that in general these have been first class and have contributed greatly to the value of the service. Special Schools: There are 3 County Council special schools in the West Essex Division, all of which are residential. Hassobury, near Bishop's Stortford, and Chigwell High View provide places for educationally subnormal girls and boys respectively, and Nazeing Park for maladjusted pupils. There has been no change in the arrangements for medical inspections of pupils at these schools and particular attention is devoted to the assessment of the needs of educationally subnormal school leavers. Mention is also made of the need for a day E.S.No school in the southern part of the Division. Woodcroft Special School, Loughton is a private school registered by the Department of Education and Science and caters for children who are unable to benefit from the usual educational facilities. Special provision is made there for the education of /autistic, -15- autistic, spastic, brain damaged and otherwise disturbed children; the aim being to bring them up to a standard whereby they will fit ultimately into an appropriate special school suited to their age and ability. 16 children from the Division are placed there together with a number of children from other Authorities. In view of the type of child placed at the school it was arranged during the year that one of the School Medical Officers should be responsible for the medical supervision of the handicapped children at Woodcroft. The school also has close association with the Child Guidance Clinic. Handicapped Pupils: One of the most important duties of the School Medical Officer remains the assessment of the handicapped pupils in accordance with Section 34 of the Education Act 1944. This is very interesting and often rewarding work which requires considerabJe expertise to ensure that these children are recommended to receive special educational treatment best suited to their physical and mental condition. In the case of children with more than one handicap placement can be particularly difficult. 186 children were newly ascertained in West Essex as requiring this treatment in 1966. 287 pupils in the Division were receiving special educational treatment at the end of the year, nearly half of them were attending residential special schools. From the 10 categories of handicapped pupils the problems of the educationally subnormal stand out. They represent over half of the pupils in receipt of special education and 47 out of the 74 handicapped pupils awaiting placement. Health Education: The possible appointment of a Health Education Officer in 1967 to be shared between the West Essex and Harlow Health Areas should prove of great assistance in the maintenance and extension of health education programmes, both in schools and elsewhere. Considerable health education at a personal level with pupils and parents takes place at the time of routine medical examinations and is one of the important features of the interview. Time is available and allows discussion of a variety of health topics which may be causing concern to the pupil or his parents, or which the Medical Officer feels are particularly relevant from the point of view of an individual pupil. /Child -16- Child Guidance Service: The Child Guidance Service for the West Essex Division forms a part of the Harlow and West Essex Child Guidance Service, the main clinic for which is centred at Harlow. Children referred from the West Essex Division are seen either at Harlow or at a new branch Child Guidance Clinic which was set up earlier in 1966 at Loughton Hall, The Harlow Clinic also serves the Harlow Division, We have not been rigid about to which clinic patients should go making it clear that they should attend either Harlow or Loughton according to convenience of travelling, and 121 children were referred to one or other of these clinics for psychiatric interview. The Loughton Clinic works under some difficulties because it is not yet fully staffed - this is largely due to the fact that it is almost impossible to attract Psychiatric Social Workers to this type of work on the present salary scales. Social work at Loughton has therefore been carried out largely by one of the Harlow Psychiatric Social Workers. The Regional Hospital Board gave 3 Consultant Psychiatric sessions to the new clinic at Loughton and these have been filled by Dr„ J. Waldman. School Psychological Service: Dr. Lowenstein of the Loughton Clinic in a summary of his report comments:- "There has been an increase in certain aspects of the work of the School Psychologist Service during this year, especially on the part of the educational advice required by heads of schools, parents and other disciplines. Many of the problems diagnosed and, in some cases treated, were not merely educational but due to emotional factors in the child or faulty handling by parents. The Area has a vital need for a school for E.S.N, children as these children are at present being carried in their ordinary schools. The special class at the Hereward School is functioning well and provided only maladjusted children are placed there, it should continue to be a useful adjunct to the educational service in the Area." /HOME -17- HOME NURSES: BUCKHIIRST HILL: Mrs. J.

Dr. Windle Taylor, the Director of Water Examination Department of the Metropolitan Water Board, has kindly supplied the following information regarding the water supply for the district. The supply was satisfactory both as regards quality and quantity and being hard in character is not liable to be plumbo-solvent. It is piped to 16,820 premises in the district. The supply is derived from the River Lee with some well water from time to time from Chingford Mill and a little from Ferry Lane and Waltham Abbey. No new sources of supply were instituted. During the year, 1,074 bacteriological samples heve been examined and 63 samples for chemical analysis have been taken. All are reported to be satisfactory. No fluoride is added and where such occurs it represents the natural fluoride in the water. All new and repaired mains are disinfected with chlorine, and after a predetermined period of contact the pipes are flushed out and refilled; samples of water are then collected from the mains, which are then returned to service only after satisfactory results are obtained. 3 new boosters of greater capacity have been installed at Chigwell reservoir, and a length of 6 inch main has been laid in Manor Road, east of Vicarage Lane to The Maypole crossroads, and west of Vicarage Lane to Grange Hill. The total additions to the mains in the area is 949 yards.

DRAINAGE, SEWERAGE AND PUBLIC CLEANSING. Mr-. R.W. Edwards, C.Eng. ,A.M.I.C.E. ,M.I.Mun.E., Engineer and Surveyor, has kindly supplied the following information - (a) Drainage and Sewerage: The soil drainage from the greater part of the District gravitates to the main disposal works at Luxborough Lane which was improved in 1938, extended after the war and has now been further improved with the addition of final effluent and storm water treatment lagoons. A yet further extension is now planned. A smaller part of the District drains to the Millers Lane Sewage Disposal Works where the Council has also decided to make improvements, or lay a trunk sewer to take the flow to the Luxborough Lane Works, thereby eliminating this small Works. The completion of these improvements is expected to result in a higher standard of purity in the effluent to be discharged to the River Roding. As regards sewerage, the Council is faced not only with the increasing foul flows from the new development, but also with some ageing and unsatisfactory sewers which contribute to the flooding difficulties referred to below. Generally, there is a separate system of drainage in the District except in the older parts where combined sewers still exist. These combined sewers have caused flooding at various points in the District and work has started on the laying of new surface water sewers to remove part of the flow from the combined sewers in South Loughton and Buckhurst Hill and thus from the Sewage Treatment Works. A small area of Buckhurst Hill drains into the sewers of the London Borough of Redbridge at Woodford, thence via Chingford and to the East Middlesex Scheme. Part of Chigwell Row drains to the London Boroughs of Redbridge and Barking. There are 4 outlying {Jumping stations lifting the flow from low lying areas up to the main gravity sewers. (b) Public Cleansing: Domestic refuse is being collected once weekly throughout the District by the Council's vehicles and labour. A fleet of 7 compressing type refuse collection vehicles is constantly employed, supplemented by further vehicles for special collections, including a FREE service for removing bulky domestic articles (e.g. mattresses, bedsteads etc.) on request from householders. /This -23- This FREE service cannot be stressed too much as it is provided to combat the other alternative of tipping old mattresses, etc., into ditches or onto forest land or roadside verges. Trade refuse also is collected, a charge related to actual cost being made only for refuse, the character of which is clearly not domestic. Refuse is at present disposed of by controlled tipping in Chigwell at a site leased to the Council. The refuse is covered with spoil, hardcore or other innocuous filling, and during tipping, only a very small surface of refuse remains uncovered. Measures are taken against flies, etc., as necessary from time to time, but this rarely happens. This tip will be filled during the next few years. Further and more long term arrangements for refuse disposal are being made at great cost to the ratepayers as other local controlled tip sites are not available in the District, transportation of refuse in bulk to tips in outer Essex is now envisaged and proposals for this are well advanced. Salvage of paper continues to produce sales during the year. New trailers have been purchased for attachment to the refuse vehicles so that salvage can be better pre-separated before tipping. Nearly 5,000 road gullies in County and District roads are emptied (and re-sealed with clean water) by machine regularly during the year by contract. (c) Swimming Pool: The Council's new covered swimming pool is well under way and is due to be finished in the summer of 1967. 3. RIDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACT, 1964 The riding establishments in the area have been inspected and Mr. H.E.
