ROM 8 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health FOR THE Romford Urban District For the Year 1908. ROMFORD: J. E, CASTLE, Printer, Market Place. ANNUAL REPORT. To the Romford Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I beg to present my Annual Report on the health of the Romford Urban District, for the year ending December 31st, 1908. 328 deaths were registered as having occurred in the Urban District of Romford, during the year ; I do not include amongst this number those deaths which took place amongst the inmates of the Union Workhouse, except the deaths of actual residents of the district who have died there. 138 deaths were registered as having occurred at that Institution, mainly of aged people, most of whom came from those parts of the Romford Union beyond the limits of the Urban District. Eliminating these and including the deaths of town residents removed to the Union Workhouse, the deaths for the district were 188. The population of the district was estimated to be l6,300. The death-rate would therefore be 11.5 per 1,000 of the population. 1 think the Council will be satisfied that Romford maintained it reputation for a low mortality. Romford. Birth Rate.

Removed „ 9 Small Pox. One case of this disease was notified. The subject of it was a tramp admitted into the casual ward of the Union Workhouse. He was promptly removed to the Small Pox Hospital and no other case of the disease occurred. Scarlet Fever. This disease was more rife than it has been for some years past. It was very prevalent in localities beyond the Urban District, and although it never assumed the features of an epidemic, it occurred in an isolated manner over mainly the Town Ward and the Harold Wood Ward. Most of the cases were removed to the Isolation Hospital, and to this I attribute the fact that the disease was fairly kept within bounds. 115 cases were notified during the year. The steps taken to prevent the spread of Scarlet Fever are as under :—If the case is removed to the Hospital, the Sanitary Inspector at once disinfects the rooms, bedding, &c., and when the wall and ceiling are especially dirty, notice is served on the owner to re-paper and whitewash. When the case is not removed, the disinfection is done after the patient has ceased to be infectious, and in these instances, the bedding, &c., which has necessarily become more infectious than when the patient is removed in the early stages of the disease, is taken to the Hospital disinfector. That these steps for checking the spread of the disease are successful is shown by the fact that it is very rare for a second case to occur in the same family, except where the disease has been simultaneously caused by exposure to the same source of infection as the first case removed. Diphtheria. 27 cases of this disease were notified, some of which, on bacteriological examination, were shown not to be cases of diphtheria. In no instance did it assume an epidemic form. Enteric Fever. Six cases were notified, two of them having been brought into the Union Infirmary from beyond the district. 10 The remaining four were, as far as I could ascertain, contracted out of the district, and were not, at all events, connected with local sanitary defects. Measles. Prevailed rather extensively during the earlier part of the year, as was the case in other localities. As it is not a notifiable disease, I am unable to say how many cases occurred. Disease of this type (zymotic disease) caused 12 deaths, as shown in the annexed table. The death-rate from this class of disease was 0'7 per 1,000. Scarlet Fever 4 Diphtheria 6 Measles 2 Total 12 The death rate from this class of disease for the past five years has been 0'8, 0.2, 0.4, 0.4, 0.7. The following table represents the total number of infectious diseases notified during the year, 105 of which were removed to the Isolation Hospital. Scarlet Fever 115 Diphtheria 27 Erysipelas 24 Enteric Fever 4 Total 170 During the previous year 138 cases were notified, the increase of this year being caused by the increased prevalence of Scarlet Fever this year, in common with other localities bordering on London, where the disease was more prevalent than it has been for many years past. 11 Infantile Diarrhoea, which during the summer months, is frequently very prevalent, was unusually absent, only three deaths having been caused by it. Every case of infectious disease notified to me is reported by me to the Sanitary Inspector, who visits and reports to me all cases which I do not personally investigate, supplies disinfectants and disinfects the room, bedding, &c., and in cases of those diseases usually associated with insanitary surroundings (Diphtheria, &c.) he makes an exhaustive examination of the sanitary arrangements and causes any defect found to be remedied, He also, in such cases, when the drinking water is from a private source, brings me a sample of it for analysis. Periodical inspection of the various parts of the district have been made and all insanitary conditions discovered remedied bv notices served by the Sanitary Inspector, whose intervention is recorded in the tabular list below. Nuisances abated 372 Notices served 329 Summonses taken out 8 Convictions 6 Houses disinfected 96 Overcrowding abated 0 Houses repaired, &c. 5 Improved water supply 15 Wells closed 3 Houses connected with sewer 10 Privies and w.c.'s repaired 7 Cisterns repaired, &c. 5 Animals improperly kept 1 Samples of water analyzed 9 Unsound meat seized 0 The various Bake-houses, Slaughter-houses, Dairies and Workshops have been inspected, and any defects found remedied on notice served by the Sanitary Inspector. 12 The following are instances in which my action as Medical Officer of Health was required, by your instructions or by the request of the Sanitary Inspector. 1908.
