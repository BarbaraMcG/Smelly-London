January, 1926. TO THE WORSHIPFUL THE PORT OF LONDON SANITARY COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, I have the honour of presenting my Annual Report for the year ending with December, 1925. The number of vessels on which a complete Medical Examination was carried out on arrival was 996. On these and other vessels, the number of cases of illness reported to, and inquired into by your Medical Officers, was 673. Seventy-five cases were removed to Denton Hospital. No cases of plague, cholera or typhus fever have been dealt with. 37,414 rats have been recorded as destroyed on ships during the voyage or in port and in the dock areas. 1,929 rats were specially examined for plague but no mortality or other suspicious circumstance among rats in the port has arisen which could afford an examination likely to be positive. No plague infected or suspected rats have been found. An interesting experience of Smallpox is recorded in ss. " Hadrian " ; as also an outbreak of mild Scarlatina on the Training Ship " Warspite." The staff carried out 84 disinfections on shipboard on account of infectious disease. Of 113 vessels fumigated for the destruction of rats, 28 were to the requirements of the Port Sanitary Authority and six at the request of Ship Owners. Food and Sanitary Inspections have been carried out satisfactorily and the office staff have coped with a considerable increase of work in a way that has rendered the inspections effective. Throughout the personnel of the Authority, duties have been thoroughly rendered. New legislation has been reproduced in the Report. The Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924, came into force on the 1st April. The Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1925, came into force on the 1st June. The last have afforded considerable work in the newly attempted regulation of imported fats. The finding of Arsenic on imported apples caused some concern. The attitude that the arsenic is a beneficial medication, towards which an inclination is found in some quarters, is impossible to approve or countenance in any way. Two consignments of apples were rejected on account of excessive amounts. The motor launch " Joseph White" replaced the steam launch " Lady Truscott " on the 1st May. Attention has been called to the requirement of a new Smallpox Pavilion at Denton Hospital. As customary, the Annual Report on the working of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations is appended.

(Medical Inspection at Sheerness.) The routine inspection of incoming ships at Sheerness has been in abeyance since the retirement of Dr. Legge. Dr. F. H. Watson, of Sheerness, has been retained to carry out all the minimum duties in connection with declared Infectious Diseases on incoming ships. This negative position—there have been no declarations of illness during the past year—is not a satisfactory rendering of Port Sanitation and your Worshipful Committee has been exploring the position in consultation with the Rochester Port Sanitary Authority and the Ministry of Health with a view to finding a satisfactory method of securing inspection on every vessel from foreign ports which enters and remains in the Port of London Sanitary Authority's jurisdiction.

Algiers, 27th March, 1925. On March 14th a fireman reported that on the 10th he had strained himself at work, since when he had a lump in his groin. He had no constitutional symptoms and temperature was normal, and he continued at work until arrival at Suez when he was removed as "suspected plague" ; the ship was disinfected. No dead or sick rats were seen on the ship which was stated to be very free from rats. On arrival at Algiers the Port Authorities stated that they had been informed from Suez that the case was not plague. The diagnosis was doubtful ; it was possibly a hernia, and except that there was a lump in the groin there seems to have been no grounds to regard the case as plague. All the crew remained on board. The ss. "City of Norwich" arrived from Rangoon on the 16th May; ports of call— Rangoon, 22nd March, 1925. Colombo, 28th March, 1925. Perim, 5th April, 1925. Suez, 10th April, 1925. Port Said, 14th April, 1925. Algiers, 8th May, 1925. London, 16th May, 1925. 9 The patient had been exposed to venereal infection at Rangoon on the 20th March. He had swellings in the groin over a week before reporting sick to the Master, but remained on duty up to the 14th April. On arrival at Port Said on the 14th April, patient was found to have buboes in both groins, and temperature of 102° ; he was seen by a doctor who reported the case to the Quarantine authorities ; the patient was examined and removed as a suspect case of plague and the master was subsequently informed that the diagnosis had been confirmed bacteriologically. A further examination and opinion was requested, and refused. The crew's quarters and holds were fumigated and disinfected at Port Said— crew examined daily. No rats found, dead or alive. The vessel was at Port Said for three weeks. The vessel was allowed to proceed to dock, and a strict watch kept, but in view of the history of personal local treatment for venereal disease, before the patient reported sick to the master, your Medical Officer considered the case to be a venereal one. The facts were reported to the Ministry of Health. The ss. " Lycaon " arrived from Taku Bar on the 1st June. Ports of call :— Taku Bar, 31st March—1st April. Dalny, 2nd—5th April.

No venereal disease found or any other cause for the inflamed glands. The patient was said to have suffered with orchitis supposed to be due to a blow from a wire rope on the previous voyage. The patient was landed at Suez on the 18th May as a case suspicious of plague, for bacteriological examination. The agent of the company at Marseilles stated the result was negative to plague. The vessel was fumigated at Shanghai on the 11th April (11 dead rats found after fumigation), and again at Marseilles on the 24th May. No rats seen since the Shanghai fumigation. Vessel admitted to free pratique at Marseilles, 24th May. TABLE V.—Smallpox. Date. Name of Vessel, Port of Registry and Official No. Where from. No. o f Cases. How dealt with. 1925. Jan. 13 ss.

"City of Durham" arrived from Hankow, on the 13th January, 1925. A native fireman joined the vessel at Colombo on the 10th December, 1924, and was ill then ; fever continued and rash, which appeared on the 12th, proved to be smallpox. He was landed at Aden on the 18th. All the crew were vaccinated at Aden—forecastles washed down with carbolic acid and limewashed, and patient's bedding and effects destroyed. The hold was disinfested for rats at Havre. A new native crew were shipped at Colombo on the 10th December, 1924 ; source of infection, Colombo. No other cases occurred. The ss. "Mahsud" arrived atGravesend fromthe28th January and a case of illness was reported by the Master. A coal trimmer, aged 24 years, reported sick with sore throat and fever but no vomitting nor pains in the back, on the 25th January. Rash appeared on the 27th January. The patient had been vaccinated at infancy and not since. The probable place of infection was Suez on the 13th January, or Port Said on the 14th January. The case was diagnosed as one of modified Variola, the patient was removed to Denton Hospital and the native quarters disinfected. The whole native engineercrew was taken to Denton Hospital and their clothing disinfected. Sixteen Europeans and 76 native members of the crew were vaccinated by the Boarding Medical Officer, on the 28th January, the date of arrival. Considering that the case was infectious, on the 25th January, for the first time, this wholesale vaccination on the 28th should find the susceptibles in time to prevent any extension of the disease. The passengers, three in number, were notified to their respective places of destination. ss. "Hadrian"—On the afternoon of January 29th notification was received from Dr. Thomas, Medical Officer of Health for the Borough of Stepney, that a seaman had been removed to the M.A.B. Hospital from a surgery in east London for observation, the case being strongly suspicious of Smallpox, and that the man was from ss. " Hadrian," from Newcastle, lying at Free Trade Wharf. At 10.0 a.m., on the 30th January, your Medical Officer visited the ship, and also obtained confirmation of the diagnosis from the M.A.B. The history of W.B., the above case, showed that his rash appeared on Monday, January 26th ; he had been ill on the ship previously and had, while in the Tyne, obtained a " blood mixture " by way of medicine. 11 Further enquiry showed that J.P. Bo'sun, D.B. 2nd Engineer, E. McF., J.F., T.R., firemen, all of Newcastle ; J.E., fireman, of London ; J.S., Wallsend, were left at Newcastle on January 29th because of an epidemic of " influenza " which had occurred between the 24th and 28th. This was suspicious, in view of the fact that W.B. had similarly been thought to have " influenza." A vaccination and examination muster was held. Twenty-five of the crew were vaccinated, one refused, one was ashore, one had been removed suffering from smallpox, and one, W.McF., was found to have marks of quite recent smallpox on his fore-arms and diagnostic " pips " on his palms and soles. This man had obviously been a possible source of mischief. He could give no history of illness, but had had a bottle of " medicine for his blood " three weeks to a month previously. He had been well vaccinated in infancy and presented a mild type of illness now at its close. A further case, P.W., had on a former voyage been left in Newcastle, suffering from " boils on the arms." These boils were described as quite large, with much matter in them. Nevertheless there were possibilities of smallpox in this case also. The sailors and firemen were removed to Denton with all the textile contents of the forecastles, for bathing and disinfection, special attention in this being given to W.McF. A list of stevedores' men—35 in all—was communicated to the London County Council, together with the circumstances of the ship. This list was also notified to the Medical Officers of Health of the Metropolitan Districts concerned. The Medical Officer of Health for Newcastle was wired and written to with regard to the " influenza " in J.P., J.B., E.McF., J.F., and T.R. He was also acquainted with regard to J.E. and P.W. The Medical Officer of Health, for Wallsend, was also wired and written to with regard to J.S. In each case full particulars were given. The ship sailed for Newcastle on the 31st January. The Ministry of Health was informed of all the circumstances and procedure. The Medical Officer of Health, Wallsend, wrote to say that J.S. " had a slight follicular tonsillitis, and although he complained of pains in his back, there were no signs of rash or any other symptoms of smallpox." The Medical Officer of Health, Newcastle, wrote to say that E.McF. (who is brother to W.McF.), T.R., and J.E., were isolated as smallpox cases in consequence of the communication from this Authority, while J.B., he understood, was in hospital at Gosforth, under suspicion. Further, that J.P., was well and W.McF., unable to throw any light on the source of his infection. There was, however, already a case of smallpox in hospital from the same street as that in which E.McF. lived, as far as was known an isolated case. Further, he had examined P.W. (the " boils " case), and was more than suspicious that his boils had been smallpox with a deep superadded infection by suppurative bacteria. The distribution of the " boils " had been characteristic of smallpox and he had been a contemporary in illness with W. McF., the mild case found on board. The movements of the ship are comparable to those of a passenger train between Newcastle and London. No list of addresses of the passengers from Newcastle to London was obtainable. In any epidemic of smallpox as of every other infectious disease in which rash occurs, cases will be noted where rash does not develop, cases in which the history and symptoms in general would lead one to suspect onset of the disease ; naturally the complete diagnosis cannot be made in these cases. It is possible that J.S., was such a case in this small epidemic. I think the condition of smallpox without eruption occurs much more commonly than is suspected, then constituting a malaise of three or four days' duration sometimes quite severe in its manifestations. It is gratifying to note that the official issue of Infectious Diseases for the week ending 18th February only recorded the three cases of smallpox, which are included among the above, at Newcastle. This may fairly be ascribed to the prompt interaction between the Sanitary Authorities of Stepney, The Port of London and Newcastle-on-Tyne. B 12 The ss. "Benefactor" with 8 passengers, 38 Europeans and 27 native crew arrived at Gravesend on the 17th February and reported a case of skin rash. The ship left Calcutta on the 11th January, 1925 ; Colombo, 16th January, 1925 ; Port Sudan, 30th January, 1925. On arrival at Port Sudan on the 29th January, a native was landed with a disease, supposed to be chickenpox. The rash was fully out on arrival at Port Sudan on the 29th January. Massab Oola, a fireman, was found at Gravesend with a rash fully out on the 17th February. He had been taken ill on February 9th and was a confluent case of smallpox. No vaccination marks were found on this man. Of the Europeans, 20 were vaccinated ; 18 either refused vaccination or presented certificates of recent vaccination. Unfortunately these men represented, as regards 5 of them, seamen who had been in fairly intimate contact with the case. Whatever the vaccinal history or whatever the certificate in case of contact with smallpox it is desirable that a complete vaccination be made of the ship's crew. The presence of immunity to smallpox will render a man immune to the vaccine so that no disability whatever is imposed on him by the slight scratch involved, while in case a man is not immune to smallpox his need of vaccination under the circumstances of proximity to infection is obvious. The whole of the native crew (27), the most intimate contacts, were vaccinated. The forecastles were cleared, washed down and fumigated, and the textile contents were removed to Denton Hospital for disinfection by the Washington Lyons Apparatus, the whole of the natives and the European contacts being bathed. The names and addresses of the passengers and the crew who were paid off were notified to their respective Medical Officers of Health. The patient, being unvaccinated and thus a severe case, and of a virulent type of the disease, died in Denton Hospital. The ss. "Matheran" arrived from Calcutta on the 17th February. On January 28th, a native fireman was landed at Aden, with smallpox. Vaccination of crew, and disinfection were carried out at Aden. No other case occurred. The ss. "Malda" arrived from Calcutta on the 20th February. A coal trimmer was taken ill on the 19th January ; papular rash appeared on the 22nd. The case was landed at Colombo as variola on the 23rd. All passengers and crew were vaccinated on the 23rd January ; the vessel was disinfected at Colombo. The ss. "Ayrshire" arrived from Sydney on the 21st February. A native crew was taken on board at Colombo on the 25th January. An hour-and-a-half later the surgeon was called to see a fireman who had a temperature, and papular rash on his face. He was isolated at once and landed at Colombo the same day. All on board were vaccinated ; vessel disinfected, and effects removed ashore. The ss. "Auditor" arrived from Calcutta on the 21st February. A native developed smallpox and was landed at Colombo on the 23rd January. A native, on arrival at Aden, February 1st, was taken to hospital as convalescent modified smallpox, and another also as a suspicious case. All the crew were vaccinated at Colombo, and the vessel disinfected at Colombo and Aden. The ss. "Keelung" arrived from Rangoon on the 21st February. The crew from Calcutta joined at Madras, 22nd December, 1924. Three developed smallpox on the 2nd January and were landed at Pondicherry the same day. Two cases were fatal, and the third was landed for observation. A doubtful case occurred at Port Said. A coal trimmer was taken ill, 12th January ; he had a rash on face, arms, and legs, but normal temperature. No other symptoms. He was isolated on board on the 16th with sore throat and pains in body. Temperature, 100°, pimples, mattery in places on face but on arms like water blisters. Rash spread all over his body, not in successive crops. On the 18th he was improved ; 20th, sores healing. On the 21st January he was seen by the Port Medical Officers at Suez and Port Said who said disease was not smallpox. The Port Said Medical Officer diagnosed case as chickenpox. On the 30th January, patient was bathed and given clean clothing and allowed to go aft and mingle with the rest of the crew ; scabbing had ceased. His clothing, bedding, blankets, &c., were thrown overboard, and quarters were washed down with carbolic and fumigated by sulphur. 13 All hands were vaccinated on the 4th January ; native quarters were disinfected and crew landed and bathed at Pondicherry. General fumigation and spraying of quarters at Marseilles on the 6th February. This case was examined on arrival at Gravesend and found to have been a case of smallpox modified by vaccination. The ss. "Kaisar-I-Hind" arrived from Bombay on the 5th March. A Goanese steward was taken on board on the 14th February at Bombay ; on the 15th he was seen with a rash and had a history of three days' illness with fever. The rash was papular marked on face and extremities, and was diagnosed as smallpox. The patient was isolated, and landed at Aden on the 18th. The case was modified by infantile vaccination. Vaccination was carried out, and the infected quarters on the vessel fumigated and washed down ; the contents being destroyed. The ss. "Oxfordshire" from Rangoon, reported a case in the baker's mate, as having been landed at Colombo on the 2nd March suffering from smallpox. The note in the Boarding Medical Officer's Report is: "All the crew were offered vaccination at Rangoon where smallpox is prevalent. The patient was leader of nine who refused, the other eight were vaccinated at Colombo." Thus it is satisfactory that the whole crew, including all the recalcitrants, are now naturally or artificially immunised. The ss. "Morea" arrived from Sydney on the 13th March, with 269 passengers and 103 crew. A first-class passenger joined the vessel at Aden on February 26th. He had heart disease and the Surgeon saw him on this account on March 6th. On the 7th, three or four acne-like papules were noticed on his forehead and the following day a few others were seen on trunk ; the hands were free. There were no constitutional symptoms or rise of temperature. The case was very mild and doubtful, but the Medical Officer at Gibraltar agreed with the Ship's Surgeon that it was a case of mild modified smallpox. The patient was landed at Gibraltar on March 9th. One other passenger who occupied the cabin left the vessel at Marseilles but was not in contact after the eruption was first noticed. All crew and passengers, with a few exceptions, were re-vaccinated ; cabin and hospital cabin were fumigated and washed down. Precautions taken at Gravesend :—All bedding and textile articles landed for disinfection. All crew and passengers examined. Infected quarters fumigated. Names and addresses of all crew and passengers notified to the various Medical Officers of Health of the destinations given. The ss. "City of Harvard" arrived from Calcutta on the 30th March. On the 9th March a native deck Lascar was taken ill with fever, backache and vomiting; rash came out on the 12th on face and extremities. The case was diagnosed as smallpox, isolated in the ship's hospital and landed at Suez on the 16th March. The case was of moderate severity—-unvaccinated. All on board were vaccinated. The native quarters on the vessel were fumigated and washed down. On arrival at Gravesend all on board were found well. The ss. "City of Naples" arrived from Rangoon on the 28th March. On the 2nd February a native coal trimmer was taken ill, with pains in head and back, and a temperature. The case was diagnosed as smallpox and landed at Negapatam on the 2nd February. Crew's quarters on the vessel were disinfected. The ss. "Holywell" arrived from Calcutta on the 31st March. On the 1st March a native fireman was taken ill ; rash appeared on face on the 4th, and the patient was landed at Aden on the 9th as a case of modified smallpox. The crew were vaccinated at Calcutta, and the captain and remainder of crew (Europeans) vaccinated at Aden. The ship was disinfected at Aden, and the bedding destroyed. The ss. "Narkunda" arrived from Bombay on the 16th April. On the 6th April the 3rd Wireless Operator reported sick with papular rash of typical variola, and was landed at Marseilles on the 10th, the rash then becoming pustular. The patient had not been vaccinated since infancy. B2 14 Every member of the crew, and most of the passengers, were vaccinated. Cabin and hospital cabin were fumigated, and all bedding thrown overboard. The names and addresses of passengers (292) were notified to the Medical Officers of Health of the various districts, and the names and addresses of the crew notified as they left the vessel. The ss. "Merkara" arrived from Calcutta on the 17th April. On the 18th March a Lascar showed mild, modified smallpox eruption, and was landed at Colombo on the 19th. All the crew were vaccinated, and disinfection done at Colombo. The ss. "Clan Morrison" arrived from Calcutta on the 21st April, 1925. On the 5th March a native was taken ill—temperature 100° ; few spots on body and face. The patient was landed at Coconada on the 8th March as smallpox ; very mild case. All the crew were vaccinated in Calcutta ; disinfection was carried out at Coconada. The ss. "Warwickshire" arrived from Rangoon on the 8th May. On the 10th April a native fireman developed mild smallpox eruption, and was landed at Colombo on the 12th April. All crew and passengers were vaccinated and disinfection of vessel carried out at Colombo. The ss. " Royal Firth " arrived from Guernsey on the 26th September, 1925. The vessel had been in South Shields for repairs. Arrived London 11th September, 1925. Left London for Middlesbrough. Left Middlesbrough for Guernsey, 16th September. Arab fireman taken ill on the 19th September ; rash appeared on the 21st. Landed at Guernsey, suffering from variola, on the 21st September. Vaccination of crew, and disinfection of vessel, carried out in Guernsey. The vessel was kept under strict watch while in the Port of London, and left for Middlesbrough on the 30th September, the Medical Officer of Health for that port being notified accordingly. Information was received from Middlesbrough on the 8th October that a case of supposed smallpox had been landed from the ss. "Colorado," at Antwerp, on the 2nd October. All the crew were re-vaccinated. The patient joined the ss. "Colorado" in London on the 18th September, having been transferred from the ss. " City of Boston," then lying in the Tyne. The " Colorado " arrived at Gravesend on the 14th October from Rotterdam, and was kept under strict observation while in the Port. No further case of illness was reported, and the vessel left for Natal on the 17th October. TABLE VI.—Scarlet Fever. Date. Name of Vessel, Port of Registry and Official No. Where from. No. of Cases.

She was living on board the house-boat" Rosa John," in Leigh Creek. The tide was unsuitable for the removal of this case by launch until the night ; your Medical Officer deemed it advisable on all grounds that the case should be dealt with by the Medical Officer of Health for Southend-on-Sea. T.S. " Warspite."—An outbreak of scarlet fever occurred on the Training Ship " Warspite," lying off Greenhithe. Fifteen cases were admitted to Denton Hospital. It was not anticipated on the admission of the first or second cases that the number would be so large. Under the circumstances it seemed proper that a charge should be made for nursing and maintenance. A charge of £4 4s. 0d. per week for medical and nursing attendance was made and an additional charge of 15s. per week, per head, for maintenance, laundry, etc. It is not customary to make charges on ships for the admission of infectious disease to Denton Hospital. The underlying motive in free treatment being the prevention of any bar to the declaration of all the infections on ship-board. The "Warspite" epidemic was quite mild in type and was brought to an end by the Christmas vacation. There is great difficulty in controlling so mild an epidemic because the mildest case hardly declares itself, even on close examination, yet keeps up the infection. TABLE VII.—Diphtheria. Date.

An important article on the rat-proofing of ships which I excerpted, as below, came to my notice through the Bureau of Hygiene and Tropical Diseases:— By S. B. Grubles, Surgeon, and B. E. Holsendorff, Pharmacist, United States Public Health Services. To prepare a ship for fumigation is a partial rat-proofing. From this operation the authors evolved a complete system of rat-proofing of ships. For a demonstration one of the largest passenger vessels was chosen. Before beginning the work of rat-proofing, conditions on the vessel were studied for months; observation and trapping of rats allowed their habits to be charted with reasonable accuracy. As rat-proofing progressed, trapping results fell to zero. The rats had been practically eradicated. 42 "The response to this demonstration has been such that we have a large number of requests to begin on other ships among which are many of the finest vessels afloat." A rat-proof ship is one where it is impossible, or difficult, for a rat to hide, nest or move about in search of food. On such a ship rats gaining entry will breed with difficulty and be exposed to acute rivalry and thus decrease and even disappear. The tendency of modern ship building is towards rat-proof construction and the specifications in the article are recommended. Contracts for new construction or structural repair should include the words "all work to be rat-proof." Correction of defects in existing ships must be under some one thoroughly trained in this line of work. Prime necessities for rat-life are (1) Food and Drink; (2) Hiding and Nesting places. Therefore the principles of rat-proofing are (1) To separate home and food; (2) Prevent travelling from one to other; (3) Deprive the rats of either or both of the prime necessities. The methods are (1) Food stuffs to be kept in rat-proof containers, within rooms devoid of rat harbourage and into which rats cannot come from without; (2) To abolish small enclosed spaces or block them off with material which cannot be gnawed; (3) To screen large openings. Have doors and windows which fit. Permanently screen or close all small openings. Cost of rat-proofing is comparatively small. At the New York Quarantine Station, where rat-proofing operations are undertaken, a survey is made, the defects are listed item by item and corrected by carpenters and ironworkers under daily inspection and detailed instruction. Only items in the holds need interfere with the routine work on the ship; these have to be corrected in port. Rat-proofing of ships in New York is in actual operation. Sheet metal is used for collars about pipes where these pass through any partition, for lining bins and in strips for pipe casings. Light or heavy wire screening stop or break up larger spaces. The Specification for work to be done is fully detailed for every part of the ships. The authors make a point of the necessity for providing a sufficient number of screened containers of a folding type against stowage when not in use, for garbage and edible refuse while in port. As administrative details:— (1) All loose food supplies are to be placed under rat-proof covers, and scraps and garbage collected. (2) Crews are not to mess in sleeping quarters. (3) Food lockers in crew's quarters to be abolished. Commenting on Specifications, the authors show that wooden and closed pipe casings are objectionable and, if retained, must be rat-proofed, and have doors fitted to them. Limber and flooring boards should be kept in good order and openings under "screen bulk-heads," where they pass from one compartment to another, should be rat screened. Fore-peaks store too much gear and junk, they are difficult to fumigate and more difficult to rid of fumigant. They should be used for tanks not trash. [It would be difficult to over-estimate the importance of the closely detailed specification of materials and necessities for each part of a ship to all persons interested in the rat problem on ships. The article contains a possible, even a probable, solution of the question of shipborne rat plague as also of repeated disinfestation of ships in prevention thereof. It commends itself to both Sanitarian and Ship Owner; disinfestation for rats would be rendered unnecessary in the main and effective if found necessary. A rat "proofed in" dies. A rat "proofed out" is kept in the open and so circumscribed in his movements that he can be killed. Proofing is not a mere counsel of perfection but and effective practical measure.] This excerpt, together with a reference of the full article, has been brought to the notice of every Shipping Company using the Port of London.

In connection with Form C, the following procedure, in the Port of London, supplies the data:— All vessels from foreign ports are visited by a Medical Officer. The questions put by the Customs Officer and the answers made by the Master are heard by him and all cases of reported sickness during the voyage examined or enquired into. Ships from ports in the Eastern Hemisphere, south of latitude 45° N. (except European ports west of longitude 20° E.) and ships from ports in the Western Hemisphere south of latitude 30° N., are considered as from "infected ports" and are boarded and examined whatever the report. Ports or rather coastlines containing ports are added or exempted according to reports of the movement of infection. Medical examination under this system, whether in spite of a negative or because of a positive report of illness, has from time to time led to the detection of serious conditions of infection. On proceeding, these ships come again under scrutiny by a Sanitary Inspector while in dock, special attention being given to those on which there has been suspicious circumstance during the voyage.

The Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924, dated December 20th, 1924, made by the Minister of Health under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, came into force on the 1st of April. Since the Regulations deal as regards— Part II. Slaughter-houses and Slaughtering ; ,, III. Meat Marking; „ IV. Stalls; ,, V. Shops, Stores, etc.; ,, VI. Transport and Handling; the greater part of the Regulations have no proper application to Port Sanitary work. Certain meat stores and much transport and handling of frozen meat come under the survey of your Medical Officer, therefore, the Port Sanitary Authority has been made an enforcing Authority for certain purposes by Articles 3 and 4. "Article 3.—The Local Authority shall enforce and execute the provisions of these Regulations in their district. Provided that a Port Sanitary Authority shall also be an Authority for enforcing and executing the provisions of Part VI. within their district." "Article 4.—The Medical Officer of Health, the Sanitary Inspector and any other officer of a Local Authority or Port Sanitary Authority duly authorised by the Authority in writing shall for the purpose of ascertaining whether these Regulations are being observed have power at all reasonable times to enter and inspect any slaughter-house, room or other place and any stall or vehicle to which these Regulations apply." Part VI. " Transport and Handling," reads as follows:— 21.—(1) Every person who conveys or causes to be conveyed any meat in a vehicle— (a) shall cause to be kept clean the inside and covering of the vehicle, the receptacles in which the meat is placed and such parts of any slings or other implements or apparatus used for loading or unloading as come into contact with the meat or its covering; and (b) if the vehicle is open at the top, back, or sides, or if any other commodity is being conveyed therein, shall cause the meat to be adequately protected by means of a clean cloth or other suitable material; (c) shall not permit any live animal to be conveyed in the vehicle at the same time as meat. (2) A person engaged in the handling of transport of meat— (a) shall not permit any part of the meat to come into contact with the ground ; and (b) shall take such other precautions as are reasonably necessary to prevent the exposure of the meat to contamination. (3) Every person who employs a person to carry meat in or about a market or other place in which meat is sold by wholesale or in or about any place wholly or mainly used for the storage of meat before it is distributed to retailers, shall cause such person while so occupied to wear, and every person while so occupied shall wear, a clean and washable head covering and overall. (4) This Article shall not apply to any meat which is packed in hampers or other strongly constructed and impervious cases or is adequately wrapped in jute or some other stout fabric. For many years your Inspectors have from time to time performed functions for which they had no regular authority but which were similar to those embodied in Parts V. and VI. of these Regulations. 53 These functions may be summed up as ensuring that stores shall be kept clean and that the transport and handling shall be carried out in a cleanly manner. A circular letter of the Ministry of Health of the 12th June makes it clear that whereas a person engaged in the handling or transport of meat "shall not permit any part of the meat to come into contact with the ground" (Part VI. 21 (2) (a) ). The word "ground" is not intended to apply to any part of a ship, vehicle or building. Further that in the application of the Regulations to ships each deck of a ship would in itself form one or more separate "compartments"; effective separation of meat and other cargo on the same deck would permit that meat may be carried on that deck without special covering. The spirit of the Regulations is quite well maintained by stevedores, railway companies, and the Port of London Authority; the provision of hygienic aluminium runged slings and the cleansing of barges and railway trucks mark the initiative of the persons responsible for condition rather than incentive by the inspectors, under the Regulations. On but few occasions has the attention of offenders had to be called to the duties imposed on them. TUBERCULOSIS ORDER OF 1925 (No. 2). Meat Inspection. Circular 616, dated August, 1925, was received from the Ministry of Health accompanied by the above Order made by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries for the purposes of the Diseases of Animals' Acts. The Order is as follows:— (4002.) ORDER OF THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES. (Dated 5th August, 1925.) Tuberculosis Order of 1925. (No. 2.) The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, by virtue and in exercise of the powers vested in him under the Disease of Animals' Acts, 1894 to 1925, and of every other power enabling him in this behalf, hereby orders as follows:— 1. The Tuberculosis Order of 1925 shall be read and have effect as if the following Article was therein inserted after Article 5:— Procedure in respect of slaughter of animals where the carcases are proposed to be used for human consumption. 5a. (i.) Where a Local Authority propose to slaughter an animal under this Order and to dispose of its carcase or any part thereof for human consumption, a copy of the notice of intended slaughter served under the preceding Article, together with a statement of the address of the premises on which and the time at which the animal is intended to be slaughtered, shall be sent by the local authority with all practicable speed to the officer of the Sanitary Authority (or in Scotland of the Public Health Local Authority) to whom notices of intention to slaughter are required to be sent by any Regulations made by the Minister of Health (or in Scotland by the Scottish Board of Health) under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, and in any such case the carcase of the animal or any part thereof shall not be removed for human consumption from the premises on which the slaughter takes place except with permission in writing of the Medical Officer of Health or other competent officer of the Authority having under the Acts relating to Public Health or any local Act power to inspect and examine meat intended for human consumption. Provided that where a Meat Inspector has been appointed by a Public Health Local Authority in Scotland in terms of the foresaid Regulations the permission to be obtained under this Article shall be the permission of the Meat Inspector. (ii.) If any carcase is removed in contravention of this Article the person removing or causing the removal of the carcase shall be deemed guilty of an offence against the Act of 1894. 2. This Order may be cited as the Tuberculosis Order of 1925 (No. 2). In witness whereof the Official Seal of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries is hereunto affixed this fifth day of August, nineteen hundred and twenty-five. F. L. C. FLOUD, l.s. Secretary. g 2 54 This Order of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries is the logical outcome of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924, of the Ministry of Health in so far as these dealt with the slaughtering of cattle. Part II.—7 (1) (2) provides that (1) "This part of these Regulations shall not apply so as to interfere with the operation or effect of the Diseases of Animals' Acts, 1894 to 1922, or of any Order, Licence or Act of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries made, granted or done thereunder. (2) Articles 8, 9, 10 and 11 of these Regulations shall not apply where the slaughter takes place in a slaughter-house under the management of a Local Authority." The slaughter of tuberculous cattle, where the carcases are proposed to be used for human consumption, is brought into line by the above Order. THE PUBLIC HEALTH (IMPORTED FOOD) REGULATIONS, 1925. Foreign Fats. Under the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1925, the definition of meat "includes" any edible part of a pig or of cattle or a substance, compound, material or article of which an edible part of a pig or of cattle is an ingredient." Thus "lard, dripping, edible tallow and similar rendered fats" are " meat" The second schedule of the Regulations details "Conditionally Admissible Meat." Item (b) of the second schedule comprises "lard, dripping, tallow and similar rendered fats." Part III.—Oversea Meat.—Section II. Sub.-Sec. (4) imposes the following duty:—"If the Medical Officer of Health is of opinion that any oversea meat comprises Conditionally Admissible Meat without an Official Certificate, he shall by notice forbid the removal of the meat for any purpose other than exportation." An "Official Certificate" means a certificate, label, mark, stamp or other voucher affixed to oversea meat or a package containing such meat by a competent authority in the country of export and which is recognised by the Minister of Health as evidence of freedom from disease in the animal of derivation of the meat and of dressing, preparing and packing with all necessary public health precautions. Thus uncertificated fat from Overseas is liable to export notice on arrival and to a stop which confines it to the place of "delivery or landing" from a ship (definition: "Article of Food "). An article of food should in the nature of things be edible. The dividing line between inedible and edible tallow has breadth and also mobility to the left or right according to stocks, the market, public taste or want of the same, and the capability of the refiners. In fact the line does not exist. Material which on the face of it is edible is used freely in manufacturing processes and material which with broad criteria is inedible on examination is, in fact, eaten. "Edible" with regard to tallows cannot be defined and misunderstandings between importers and your Medical Officer of necessity arose. The subject of control of imported fats is new. The first effective step is that enjoined by the Foreign Meat Regulations and a machinery for complete control is foreshadowed in the following letter, which brought the matter to the attention of importers. To those importers who fall in with the arrangements made, little difficulty and delay will eventually arise. Two guarantees are required:— (1) That material under notice of export will not be removed from the agreed place of deposit except for purpose of export unless used for manufacturing purposes apart from food. (2) In case of this latter manufacture the guarantee of the manufacturer. All uncertificated material, as in item (b) of the schedule, entering the port is placed under the Order of Export and held pending acceptable assurance of the 1st guarantee. On deposit in the place of guarantee, release only takes place for export or, on receipt of the 2nd guarantee, for commercial use. 55 Community of action as between Medical Officers has been secured. This letter was sent to about fifty firms known to be interested in the tallow trade. Port of London Sanitary Authority. Offices:—5, Church Passage, Guildhall, London, E.C. 2. 16th November, 1925. Dear Sirs, The Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1925, No. 273. Conditionally Admissible Meat, Second Schedule (b) Lard, Dripping, Edible Tallow and similar rendered Fats. For your information on requirements with regard to fats in connection with the abovementioned Regulations, I have drawn up the following list of practical essentials:— (1). (a) "Lard, dripping, edible tallow and similar rendered fats" will only be admitted to this country for the purpose of use as or in human food if accompanied by an "Official Certificate." (Fats excluded under this definition are—Premier Jus, Oleo Oil, Oleo Stearine and Whale Oil). (b) The "Official Certificate" is either a certificate, label, mark, stamp or other voucher for the time being recognised by the Minister of Health, affixed to each package. (c) The "Official Certificate" differs for the different countries of fat export both in form and design, e.g., for Australia it is a mark or stamp of special design impressed on a package; while for the United States of America it is a label, the imprint of which is of a different design from that of the Australian mark. (d) The "Official Certificate" must be affixed to each package. A consignment of two or more packages is not covered by any one "certificate" or mark whatever the form of certificate; each package must be "officially certificated," i.e., must bear such proper label or mark or stamp as is set out for each country in the Regulations. (2) There is no embargo whatever on the use of " certificated " material for manufacturing processes not connected with food. (3) A package of "Lard, dripping,edible tallow and similar rendered fat" which is not "officially certificated " will be stopped under order for exportation, until it be either exported or released for process of manufacture of material other than food. Consent to storage will only be given on the guarantee of the Importer that either he will export or that he will not sell the material for food manufacture. Release for manufacture will only be given on guarantee from the final purchaser and user that he will use the material for manufacture into stuffs unconnected with food—the nature of the final article of manufacture being specified in the guarantee form, together with the address of the works at which the manufacture will take place. The release will not be issued to the person in control at the place of storage until the final guarantee (that of the eventual manufacturer) be deposited with the Port of London Sanitary Authority, on the enclosed form. (4) The countries for which "Official Certificates" are at present arranged are:— Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, United States of America and Netherlands. (5) The Regulations on which this letter is based are:— The Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1925, No. 273, dated March 23rd, 1925. Circular 558, dated March 27th, 1925. As regards Official Certificates:— Circular 599, dated May 27th, 1925. Circular 633, dated October 24th, 1925. (Issued by the Ministry of Health, and obtainable from H.M. Stationery Office, Adastral House, Kingsway, London, W.C. 2.) Your obedient servant, (Sgd.) W. M. WILLOUGHBY, Medical Officer of Health, Port of London. 56 THE PUBLIC HEALTH (IMPORTED FOOD) REGULATIONS, 1925 Date To The Medical Officer of Health, Port of London, 5, Church Passage, Guildhall, E.C. 2. I, the undersigned, being the purchaser of lying at ex do hereby declare that in consideration of the said goods being released to me no portion of them shall be used for human food in any form, and that THE WHOLE OF THE SAID GOODS SHALL BE REMOVED TO MY PREMISES AT (give full postal address.) and there used for the purpose of I also guarantee that no portion of the said goods shall be disposed of to any person for any purpose whatsoever. (Signed) (Address) NOTE:—Departure in any way from the strict fulfilment of this guarantee renders the signatory liable to a penalty not exceeding £100, and, in the case of a continuing offence to a further penalty not exceeding £50 for every day during which the offence continues. TALLOW. A consignment of ten cases of tallow was found to have one leading mark, three descriptions and two grades : Casks 1-5 contained inedible tallow. „ 6 edible. These were edible on ,, 7-10 first grade. appearance. It has been noticed in other cases that tallow varies in the same mark and varies in the same cask; even where a sample is drawn and the contents of the cask passed as sound, a great deal has to be taken on trust. The centre of a cask of tallow may be very rancid though externally sound. I had to bring to the notice of your Worshipful Committee two instances of recent food seizure illustrative of more or less subtle points in the feeding of the nation. 198 cases (each containing 10 by 11-lb. tins), weight 194 cwts. 1 qr. 24 lbs.. of orange pulp from Spain. The 1980 11-lb. tins of this consignment show— (a) Externally:— (1) That many tins have been punctured and re-sealed. (2) That the lids of most of the tins have been cut out and re- soldered on by their margins. (3) That the lateral weld has been re-soldered. (4) That most of the tins have been brushed, and are smeared with oil. (b) Internally:— (5) That the tin had been dissolved from the casing by physico- chemical action. (6) That the contents in contact with the casing are discoloured by tin compounds 57 (c) By Analysis:— (7) That tin is present in solution throughout the mass in quantities represented by 6.16, 6.86, and 7.14 grains per lb. (Three analyses). (d) By Taste:— (8) That the material, purporting to be shredded orange by appearance, has lost much of the characteristic strength of flavour of orange peel. (9) That a metallic bitterness is present. The inferences are as follows:— From (1), (2) and (3), that these tins have at some period contained blown (fermented) material. From (4), (5), (6), (7) and (8), that the material in the tins at the time of examination was old and constituted that formerly fermenting mass. From (2) and (8), that the tins were opened, submitted to a process of resterilisation by re-heating during which the vaporisable flavours were largely lost to the material, and re-sealed. From (8), the material is unsound. From (7) and (9), it is unwholesome and unfit for human consumption. Its defects and unfitness could be cloaked in the form of a flavourless marmalade of somewhat soft consistency as regards the solids, or otherwise. As a foodstuff the almost sole function of which is the stimulation of a zest for that to which it is added, the material would be practically useless. The consignees wished the rapid delivery of part of this consignment which had been sorted out as not presenting an external greasing of the tins—the only and insufficient criterion of fitness as compared with the remainder. This material has been seized and destroyed. In the case of a consignment of 379 cases and 36 crates, weight about 9 tons 3 cwts. 1 qr. 26 lbs., of milk powder, presenting some degree of rancidity it was suggested that the material should be used for confectionery (sweets) or for cake making. Your Medical Officer considers that any process in confection would not more than disguise the products of rancidity. They would be insufficiently removed to prevent the nausea to which many people are prone on ingestion or taste of rancid material. The consignment will be passed for cattle feeding if suitable guarantees can be produced. SWEEPINGS. With reference to the large item which is to be noted in the Reports on Food Seizures in this Authority, namely "Sweepings," it is of interest that a huge consignment of chocolate Easter Eggs was seized and destroyed in the City of Liverpool on account of the miscellany—metals, woodwork, glass, flinty materials, etc.—found in the chocolate on analysis. The chocolate from which these eggs were made was prepared from cocoa obtained from one of the London Wharves outside the jurisdiction of this Authority, and may be inferred to have been "sweepings." Another possible source of the contamination described is sugar sweepings. THE PUBLIC HEALTH (PRESERVATIVES, ETC., IN FOOD), REGULATIONS, 1925. These Regulations may be extracted as follows:— (I.) These Regulations come into operation on January 1st, 1927. Part I. Become operative (1) as to butter and cream on January 1st, 1928. (2) As to the sale of articles of food in which preservative is introduced by reason of the preservative content in the material of manufacture, i.e., bacon, ham, margarine, butter. July 1st, 1927—articles manufactured from bacon, ham, margarine. July 1st, 1928—butter. 58 (II.) "Local Authority" means one authorised under the Sale of Food and Drugs' Act. "Preservative" is any material arresting decomposition, fermentation or acidification, except common salt, salt petre, sugars, acetic acid or vinegar, alcohol or potable spirits, herbs, hop extract, spices and essential oils of the process of smoking or of flavouring. "Sulphur Dioxide" includes Sulphites. "Benzoic Acid" includes Benzoates. "Importer" includes owner, consignor, consignee, agent or broker in possession, custody or control of food from outside Great Britain, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. Part II. (III.) The Local Authority and its authorised officers exercise, enforce and execute this part of the Regulations. (IV.) (I) The manufacture or sale of preserved food, with preservatives or with colouring matters specified in Part II. of the 1st Schedule, is illegal. Proviso. (1) Sulphur Dioxide or Benzoic Acid preservative in scheduled specified quantity is permitted in sausage, wet fruit and fruit pulp, dried fruit, unfermented grape juice, non-alcoholic wines, jam (but not marmalade), candied peel, sugar, corn syrup, gelatine, beer, cider, wine, mineral waters, ginger beer, coffee extract, pickles, and sauces made from fruit and vegetables. (2) Foods manufactured from these may contain Sulphur Dioxide or Benzoic Acid thus necessarily introduced. Forbidden colouring matters (Schedule 1, Part II.) are antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, lead, zinc, gamboge and various coal-tar colours. (2) Sausage, sausage meat, coffee extract, pickles and sauces which are scheduled articles of food and which may therefore contain one of the specified preservatives, sulphur dioxide or benzoic acid, shall be labelled as to the amount of preservative. Grape juice and wine containing over 600 parts per million benzoic acid are to be similarly labelled. Proviso. (1) The labelling regulation does not apply to retail sale, or to hotel or restaurant service for consumption on the premises. (2) In retail sale, an easily readable notice of the presence of preservative in the article sold or exposed for sale must be conspicuously exhibited. (V.) (1) Preservative sold as such must be labelled as to its preservative content and the nature of the preservative whether sulphur dioxide or benzoic acid. (No other preservative than these is permitted). (2) Preservative which is contrary to the Regulations may not be advertised or recommended in any way. (3) Nor may cream "thickeners," i.e., any article devised to increase the viscosity of cream. (VI.) (1) Secures entry of premises used for preparing, packing, labelling or storing food. (2) Secures the taking of samples (with reasonable payment therefor). (3) The sampling is done according to the rules laid down in the Food and Drugs' Acts. (VII.) An article at fault sold in one district may have been previously sold into this district from another district; proceedings may be taken against the previous as well as the immediate seller, whatever the district; the offence of the previous seller may be deemed to have been committed in the district of final sale but the Magistrate's Court of either district may be appealed to for judgment in the case. 59 Part III. Importation of Articles of Food. (VIII.) Officers of Customs and Excise are empowered to enforce Part III. (IX.) (1) Where an article of food is landed (i.e, imported in a sealed vehicle whose examination is deferred or by airship) outside a Port Sanitary Authority, the Local Authority at the place of landing has jurisdiction. In every other case a Port Sanitary Authority. (2) The importer and the public analyst shall each receive a portion of the sample taken for analysis. (X.) Where an offence is found, the Commissioner of Customs or the Port Sanitary Authority shall communicate to the Minister the name of the importer and facts as to the destination of the consignment. (XI.) No person shall import an article of food not in accordance with the Regulation as to home manufacture before detailed (Part II., 4, 5) or any cream which contains "thickening." Part IV. Miscellaneous. (XII.) Export or re-export goods are exempted from these Regulations or, in the case of butter, such as are intended for use as ships' stores. (XIII.) Analyst's certificates are good evidence unless the defendant requires the calling of the analyst. Onus of proof as to the intention of sale for export or re-export or of the use of butter as ships' stores, lies with the defendant. (XIV.) A person if so required shall give an officer acting under the Regulations every germane information and reasonable assistance. (XV.) The Milk and Cream Regulations, 1912, and amending order 1917 and The imported Food Regulations, 1925 (so much as relates to *paragraph "f"—1st Schedule) are revoked. To sum up— (1) Two preservatives only, sulphurous acid and benzoic acid, may be used, whether in home manufactured or in imported food. (2) These preservatives may only be used in certain scheduled articles and in quantities for each article limited by schedule. (3) Certain colouring matters are prohibited by schedule. (4) "Thickening" of cream is prohibited. (5) Preservative sold as such requires a specific label stating percentage strength. (6) Certain foods (scheduled) containing preservative must be labelled. (7) Two years' grace is afforded to butter and cream and to articles into which butter enters on manufacture, and one year and a half to articles into which bacon, ham and margarine enter. To food stuffs in general, one year. In comment, one may say that the difficulties to manufacturers which will inevitably arise are the direct result of absence of former regulation. The Regulations imply a side step into the path of true progress with regard to the nation's supply of pure food. The restriction of the scheduled foods which may contain preservative to wet and dried fruits, jams, pickles and beverages, with restriction of the amount and nature of the preservative, is very satisfactory. The interest of manufacturers using boric acid are very large, and the controversy on boric acid is proportional to this interest. The correct view point in sanitary interests is not whether boric acid can be used but whether it can be omitted and the free flow of foodstuffs maintained. The members of the Royal Commission think boron can be omitted from food. I hope the proof of this will now be forthcoming, as I strongly hold the opinion that it is at least inimical to free digestion of food in the human organism and at worst upsets the mechanism of digestion, both per se and by cloaking other deleterious matter. *Refers to tripe, tongue, kidney and edible offal containing formaline, fluorine, boron, salicylic acid, formic acid, sulphurous acid or benzoic acid. H 60 ARSENIC IN APPLES. Certain apples arriving in the Port have been alleged to have caused arsenical poisoning. It has been, therefore, advisable to make analyses of any apples showing marked deposit in the stem pit. This pit is a likely indicator of danger on inspection. The circumstance points to an unusual chain of events in which the meteorological conditions under which the early crop in certain districts was gathered, were the predominant factor. The intimate relation between mercantile and public health interests in this matter, both of which drive in the same direction, will ensure for the future a rigid scrutiny at the point where remedy and prevention can be best carried out, namely, the orchards of production. The danger is, I believe, small, now that it is brought to light, and transitory. But the presence of arsenic on foodstuffs in varying quantity, even if small in view of possible immediately harmful quantities, is intolerable. Full safeguards must be arranged at the proper place—the orchard. Meanwhile apple crops from any place will be closely watched. The following letter, which is self-explanatory, was sent to the High Commissioners for the Dominion of Canada, Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, Union of South Africa, Dominion of Newfoundland, Southern Rhodesia. Agents-General for New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania, Quebec, Nova Scotia, Ontario and British Columbia. Consul-General for the United States of America. Medical Officers of Health for Ballarat, Melbourne, Adelaide, Port Adelaide, Brisbane, Fremantle, Perth, Hobart, Queenstown, Auckland, New Plymouth, Wellington, Nelson, Christchurch, Dunedin, and Cape Town. It appeared to your Medical Officer that the significance of the contamination could not be too widely circulated in all possible countries of origin. 16th December, 1925. Sir, I venture to ask your help in the following serious matter. You may have noticed that certain imported apples at present on the English market have been found to convey doses of Arsenic to the consumer. I am given to understand that meteorological conditions are somewhat responsible for the residual arsenical and other contamination of apples; if this be so in fact, a course of prevention may be found as simple as the original spraying—namely, a final washing of the apple on the tree. In the Fruit World Annual, January number, published in Melbourne, are articles and advertisements advocating Lead Arsenate as a repeated spray for apples during growth; such sprays are possibly in world-wide use. Considering the subtle character of lead poisoning and of arsenical poisoning and our past experience in England of severe detriment to the public health from persistent ingestion of very small quantities of either of these metals in contamination of food, I have to bring to your notice the importance to fruit growers of immediately making their practice in spraying coincide with public health necessities. Crops of fruit at present on the tree or any future crops which on arrival here give more than an infinitesimal—an absolutely neglible amount of arsenic lead or other metallic contamination, must be subjected to such drastic action as will of necessity severely affect every person concerned in the trade in such apples. The forestalling of any such procedure should be undertaken at the point of effective, and it would seem, economic prevention—the orchard, and at once insisted on. I would suggest that methods of cleaning away the residual arsenic lead-arsenate or other contamination before packing, or alternatively abandonment of the dangerous contaminating process, are as much matters for the attention of the expert grower as prevention of the codlin moth grub. I feel sure you will permit me to express these opinions and to convey a warning which must apply to every crop on the tree at present or in future, that may be destined for British consumption. The contamination of apples will in future be examined with regard to every consignment from the standpoint that whatever be the growers' methods the eventual packed fruit must be in a natural state—contamination free. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Sgd.) W. M. WILLOUGHBY, Medical Officer of Health, Port of London. CANNED SPINACH. Letters were received from Plymouth, Dover, Deptford, Exeter, Harwich, Great Yarmouth, and Liverpool, showing that the action of your Worshipful Committee in the matter of tinned spinach would receive every support from those districts in securing uniformity of procedure. 61 Your Medical Officer received the following letter from the Consul-General for Belgium, in the matter of tinned spinach:— Sir, 15th January, 1925. I am in receipt of a letter from Mr. -, manufacturer of canned goods at C- in Belgium, enclosing copy of your correspondence with him concerning 25 cases of canned spinach lying at "I" warehouse, St. Katharine's Dock, ex ss. "Arran Firth." He begs me to intervene to avoid the destruction of the goods he sent to London, and asks for leave to reexport the goods to my country. I should feel obliged if you could see your way to grant the required authorisation. I draw your attention to the fact that Mr.- is a very honourable gentleman, who had certainly not in mind the contravening of the regulations in your country, and therefore such measures as destruction should not be applied in his case. Awaiting the favour of your reply, I am, Sir, &c., &c. and replied as under:— 16th January, 1925. Sir, I have the honour of your communication of the 15th January with regard to Mr.-' s canned goods and regret that I see no way of granting the authorisation for the return of the goods you seek on Mr. -' s behalf. I do not doubt Mr.-' s bona fides, but under the order of the Port of London Sanitary Authority in the matter of excessively coppered vegetable matter, various consignments from Belgium have been already destroyed and to make an exception in this case would be a want of consistency which would be quite confusional. The only way for consistent dealing with the material at present is that Mr.- should authorise Messrs. D. R. E. & Co. to sign the notice for destruction which is with them. Hoping you will see the difficulty of acceding to your courteous request. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Sgd.) W. M. WILLOUGHBY, Medical Officer of Health, Port of London. The 25 cases, above referred to, were eventually destroyed by consent of the owners. FUMIGATION OF FRUIT. In September it was brought to my notice that an operation for the fumigation of dried fruits was in process in the Port, and that this operation required a gas mask on the part of the operator. A knowledge of the essence of the process was necessary to your Medical Officer from two points of view, first that of the purity of the food, and, secondly that of the security to human beings during the process. On communication with Australia House, for it appeared that the Dried Fruit Board of the Australian Commonwealth were chiefly concerned in the matter, the exact constitution of the spray was courteously communicated to me in confidence. The process is a commercial secret. On examination and consideration of the method and circumstances under which the fumigation was carried out, I had no hesitation in expressing approval of the methods. Questions then arose as to the workers who discharge the cargoes. It appears that if the barges set apart for the process are unloaded too early after fumigation, the unloading is distinctly unpleasant. This unpleasantness is the precise measure of any danger or rather discomfort which may arise from the ingredients of the fumigant. I have suggested that the necessary time for airing a barge would vary with the meteorological conditions but that the men should not enter such a barge after fumigation in less than one hour from the opening out. If by that time the smell is still distinctly disagreeable a further period should elapse. I have also expressed the view that the Port of London Sanitary Authority is far from having any objection to a process which seems effective in dealing with larvae in currants and dried fruit generally, on the contrary highly approves this advance in the treatment of food which on storage might itself deteriorate or be the source of infection of other material. The constituents of the fumigant being evaporable leave no residue whatever on the fruit. I have not yet tested the efficacy of the process by actual experiment but conclude that an expensive process would not be pursued unless it had been found of commercial value and thus secondarily of benefit to the consumer. The Publication Department of the Bournville Works have recently produced a brochure—" Insect Pests in the Cacao Store," by A. W.

ORDERS OF NOVEMBER, 1916. In August and October representations were received from the Medical Officer of Health for Southend that illegal collection and sale of mussels was taking place from the Hadleigh Bay and in Leigh district respectively. Certain offenders had been traced and warned by the Sanitary Inspector of the district. A further warning was issued by your Medical Officer to these men. There is evidence that some men persisted in regarding the boiling of mussels in the same way as that laid down in the orders for cockles, as sufficient; there is also alleged trickery on the part of others by way of mingling Dutch mussels with those of the Bay. Eventually the local Chairman of The Cocklers' Union took the matter up and afforded your Medical Officer the opportunity of placing copies of the orders where they can be understood and, if necessary, explained to the offenders. The latter have also received copies of the orders, with stringent warning. I am in hopes that the sale of these dangerous shellfish contrary to the orders, will now be stopped. No case of disease attributed to shellfish has been represented to your Medical Officer during 1925. In connection with shellfish and otherwise, a matter which is not yet ripe for report, but which will obtrude itself in the future, is that of the Southend new sewage scheme. On the 15th September, 1925, by the courtesy of the consulting engineer to the County Borough of Southend-on-Sea Corporation, your Medical Officer attended a preliminary meeting of parties interested at the Surveyors' Institution, Great George Street, Westminster. Mr. Gibson was in the chair, Dr. Bullock, Medical Officer of Health for the County of Essex, representatives of the Surveying Department of the Port of London Authority and myself constituted the meeting, at which the only question was one of flotation experiments. Your Medical Officer produced a map of former flotation experiments conducted in 1907, in connection with the former sewage scheme, to which further interesting information has now been added. 67 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

"Peregrine," which goods contained more than two grains per lb. sulphate of copper. The Magistrate condemned the article of food and ordered it to be destroyed or disposed of under the supervision of your Medical Officer by such means and in such a manner as to prevent its being used for human consumption. Proceedings contemplated with regard to three other consignments were avoided by the belated consent of the consignee to their destruction. HOUSE-BOATS—BENFLEET CREEK. On the 10th July I received a letter which had been sent to the Port of London Authority, dated the 4th July, by the South Benfleet Parish Council, drawing attention to the alleged serious pollution of Benfleet Creek from many house-boats stationed there, and stating that "This creek is at times, becoming a serious nuisance and it is hoped that early steps may be taken to prevent the use thereof for drainage purposes of this description." On the 10th July I sent to the Clerk of the South Benfleet Parish Council a copy of the Bye-Laws made by the Port Sanitary Authority relating to house-boats, and informed him that action would be taken where legal evidence for such purpose of any infringement of the Bye-Laws by house-boats could be ascertained. An inspector was also sent to Benfleet to investigate the matter complained of, and he reported that he visited Benfleet Creek and served copies of the Bye-Laws on the occupants of several of the house-boats, and that he estimated there were about 18 other boats which were inaccessible at the time of his visit. Most of the boats visited were in fair condition and every care appeared to be taken by the occupants to prevent pollution of the creek. Refuse was either burned or placed on an allotment near by. On the 22nd August the Ministry of Health, having received a complaint of the alleged pollution of the Benfleet Creek from the many house-boats there, wrote saying that they would be glad to receive the observations of the Port of London Sanitary Authority in the matter. I had to state my opinion that those moving in the matter imagine legal powers to exist by which these boats can be totally removed from the Creek by the Port of London Sanitary Authority, and that the motion is to that end—removal. Further, that in the main the Bye-Laws made by your Worshipful Committee are being observed by the inhabitants of the house-boats, particularly because of the fear of removal, and that on inspection, in only one or two instances can infringements be inferred. The state of the Creek does not appear to be insanitary, though rubbish such as tins and paper in the Creek mud are in evidence, as part of the continuous picnic enjoyed by others as well as the inhabitants of the house-boats. The legal position is precisely that which obtains in part of the same waters known as Leigh Creek, and has now no strictly sanitary aspect. At the same time the majority of the boats are unseaworthy and therefore liable to internal insanitary conditions. They will not long lie afloat elsewhere than in such positions as designate them houseboats according to the Bye-Laws, which matters are in the jurisdiction of your Worshipful Committee. The Port Sanitary Authority has no grounds for removal of the boats but only for regulation of these as dwellings. I 68 CONGRESS OF THE ROYAL SANITARY INSTITUTE. At the Edinburgh Conference, from the 20th to 25th July last, Mr. Leo Taylor and your Medical Officer represented the Port of London Sanitary Authority. Your Medical Officer was Recording Secretary of the Section of Port Sanitary Authorities and contributed a paper dealing with the Plague of London, 1665, in connection with sulphur fumigation. Dr. Picken, of Cardiff, contributed a paper on fumigation in general and the subjects were discussed from many points of view by expert and interested authorities, amongst whom the Protectorates and Colonies of England were well represented. There can be no doubt that such Conferences lighten the work of a Port Sanitary Authority in England; the exchange of ideas with representatives from abroad results in waging war within the enemy's frontier. One can only ascribe the comparative immunity of London within recent years to the world-wide awakening on the subject of Plague and other ship-borne diseases, and the confining of these to their endemic centres. Another well conducted and very successful section of the Conference was that in which Veterinary matters were discussed. The extremely good work done by the Royal Sanitary Institute in the cause of sanitation will afford an opportunity for its recognition next year, in that the Conference is to be held in London. AMSTERDAM CONGRESS. In the unavoidable absence of the Chairman, Mr. W. Eortescue and your Medical Officer represented the Port of London Sanitary Authority, on the occasion of the International Congress in Industrial Hygiene, at Amsterdam, from the 7th —12th September, also an occasion for examining the large and historical Port of Amsterdam. By the courtesy of Dr. W. P. Veldhuizen, the Medical Administrator of the Port, who placed at our disposal a launch and personally conducted us over the extensive waterways under his care, an insight into the special problems of this unique port were gained, while the Harbour-master of Amsterdam, on a further trip, afforded a close acquaintance with the barging and canal systems in conjunction with the River Amstel. The Port extends along an inlet from the Zuider Zee—the Ij, which is a closed water from which at the western end the locked Noordzee Canal disembouches and which at a point three miles to the east of Amsterdam is dammed and locked against the Zuider Zee. The Ij, thus locked, averages only the width of the Thames at Tilbury or less. A dredged channel gives 30 feet of water. This channel is not disturbed by any swift current. The scour of the Ij harbour is that produced by the flow of what surface water is pumped up from the low-lying polders or which otherwise runs from the meres and canals of Holland proper, particularly by the Amstel on the south and the Zaan on the north. The country being below high-water level on the average, and yet having to rid itself of the rainfall, presents the anomaly that its dammed harbour in the Ij may have so high a water level that the sluices of Amsterdam's town canals must be closed against the total output, in which these canals, branches of the Amstel, have a share. This constitutes a vicious circle requiring close attention to sluices and regulation of flows, besides which the regulation of Thames-valley floods becomes relative simplicity when high tide without and flood within-locks coincide. It was at once a misfortune and good luck to find our visit coincide with a cyclonic state of weather, such that the sluices of Amsterdam would have to be closed against the waters of its own harbour, the Ij, should these waters have risen but two inches further. More than one instance of barges approaching one or other of the 300 bridges within the Old Town only to find their freeboard an inch or two in excess of the passage height was observed and heard. The Old Town of Amsterdam is raised on the Delta of the Amstel into the Ij, its houses are drained into its canals direct. These canals are the sewers and the sewage problem, therefore, resolves itself into again carefully directed sluicing 69 and distribution of the waters of the Amstel and Noordzee Canal through the various channels. In spite of the heavy rains at the time of our visit, the difficulty of full efficiency in this peculiar water carriage sewage system was well illustrated every time the launch went astern in order to round a corner. The new portion of Amsterdam, extending in a semi-circle round Old Amsterdam, is drained directly into the Zuider Zee. A further portion of the town which will eventually ring the mid- or new-town is largely on polder land, below the level of the remainder of the town. The biological systems, such as the activated sludge, will eventually be used here. It will be readily inferred that the water of the Ij is not of the purest description but a complication of the pollution is afforded by the extensive use of paraffin motors amongst the barges, both on canals and harbour, together with the special and vast oil dock about the basin of which we sailed. A peculiar condition of the water is that for about one metre in depth there is a fine emulsion of oil, very evident at the bathing station on the harbour front. The problem of maintaining a quarantine station which is, of necessity, from time to time empty, against the destructive efforts of boys (especially, Dr. Veldhuizen mentions, the smashing of windows) is illustrated by the use of this station as a Venereal Ablution and Immigrant Disinfection centre. Diphtheria carriers are also lodged here. Dr. Veldhuizen was unable to show us the actual process of disinfestation by means of " Cyclon." It is interesting that a ship under disinfestation at the time of our visit was using the time honoured sulphur dioxide method. He explained the principle which is that of using hydrocyanic acid with an admixture of a tear gas. The hydrocyanic acid impregnates diatomatious earth, i.e., an earth consisting of shells of microscopic organisms which, being hollow, are somewhat tenacious of the disinfecting material, to form a disinfecting sand. This is standardised as to the amount of evapourable poison contained in the mixture and is dispensed from tins of varying size according to the capacities of the spaces to be fumigated. The American Authorities have accepted this standardised measure in disinfestation as satisfying their Regulations. Of course, the inherent danger of hydrocyanic acid is not to be avoided by any means of disposal of the poisonous gas, but this sprinkling of a sand, which evaporates its active medium, is a decided advance as regards dangers on any barrel methods or other bulk production of the gas, avoiding, as it does, extremely lethal concentrations of the hydrocyanic acid vapour. Justly proud of the Rotterdansche-Lloyd vessels which trade with Java and Sumatra, of which we saw two lying at the quays, one of them v/ith the blue peter at its fore and later moving majestically up the Ij, the Authorities are jealous of the introduction of insect life into the upper works and passenger accommodation of these vessels. The " Cyclon " hydrocyanic methed of disinfestation, therefore, serves a very useful purpose as regards these upper works. The use of this material requires a Port Sanitary Authority disinfesting staff, though, beyond the use of a gas mask, there is no special difficulty in the performance of a disinfestation with " Cyclon." An import which was in evidence in the harbours was those poles from Norway and Sweden which by a change of vowel and return to the vertical, alternatively with blocks of stone, natural or artificial, become the sub-stratum of all buildings. Targe rafts of these piles were to be seen. Holland has been raised somewhat up to water level by sand carried from Europe by way of the Rhine and Meuse ; where these sands meet the North Sea they are further raised well above the water level by wind and wave to form a western bulwark of dunes. The largest industry of Holland is agriculture ; the difficulty of finding potable water for the supply of a large town becomes evident. It may be partly obtained from the beautifully bushed dunes, but it seems probable that chlorination must in the future play a large part in the water supply. The Congress changed its venue to the Hague via Leiden, by way of canal. The reception and effort on our behalf by the Municipality of Leiden was as gracious as interesting. The historical association of physical and moral grit in Holland proper are fittingly exemplified in the Haarlem Meer Polder and in the places of interest in the town examined that clay. i 2 70 In result, that broadened outlook in Port and other Sanitation which was sought on this occasion was amply derived amid physical conditions which are poles apart from those obtaining in the home port. The polyglot nature of an International Congress afforded difficulties which were successfully overcome, as far as can be done, by the excellent arrangements made by Dr. Menko. HOSPITAL. Smallpox Block.—It became evident during the year that the smallpox block was becoming too dilapidated for use and even dangerous. Considering the variety of the cases taken into Denton Hospital and the obvious necessity of the strictest possible isolation of smallpox cases, your Medical Officer has advised that a special pavilion be provided to replace the present structure. An arrangement had been made with the Military Authority at Fort Pitt, Chatham, by which the Port Sanitary Authority would take care of a limited number of military cases of smallpox, should such arise. This arrangement was of necessity abrogated since it became evident that accommodation would be difficult. Disinfector.—On an inspection of the boiler of the Washington Lyon Steam Disinfecting apparatus in November, it was found that many of the tubes were badly wasted, therefore, the whole of the tubes were renewed. LAUNCHES. The new motor launch, "Joseph White," was taken over by this Authority on the 1st May; when brought from Wivenhoe in a very high wind she was able to show some of her seaworthy qualities which have since been further proved. The official dimensions are as follows:— Length, 74.8 feet. Breadth, 15.6 feet. Depth from top of beam amidships to bottom of keel, 8.2 feet. Length of engine room, 14.6 feet. Engines—two, internal combustion, Thorneycroft's, 4 by 6 in. Horse power, 104. Speed of vessel, 9.5 knots. Gross tonnage, 66.23. Net tonnage, 27.19. Register tonnage, 39.04. The boat was christened by Mrs. White, in the presence of the Lord Mayor, on the 2nd May. This launch replaces the only remaining steam launch, "Lady Truscott," which is now laid up for sale. STAFF. The only changes made on the permanent staff, during the year, were as follows:— Sanitary Inspectors.—Mr. William Ewart Smith, a sanitary inspector on probation, resigned on the 30th June. Mr. Reginald Clifford was appointed sanitary inspector to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr. Smith. He was also appointed an assistant officer under the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1925. Hospital.—Mr. and Mrs. Rutland, handyman and laundress, who had been on the temporary staff since the 24th March, 1924, were placed on the permanent staff dating from the 6th June. Several changes were made in the temporary staff of nurses and domestics at the Hospital. 71 CANAL BOATS ACTS AND REGULATIONS. Difficulties having been experienced by Sanitary Authorities in administering the Regulations made on the 20th March, 1878, under which the responsibility for the habitable condition of a canal boat (except as regards the periodic painting of the interior of cabins) is placed entirely on the master of the boat, and the Minister of Health being of opinion that circumstances may arise in which it is desirable that proceedings should be taken against the owner of the boat in respect of defects in habitable conditions, particularly structural defects. Regulation 3, has therefore, been amended so as to place upon the owner of a canal boat the responsibility of maintaining the boat in the condition required at the time of its initial registration. The following is a copy of the Amended Regulations:— STATUTORY RULES AND ORDERS, 1925, No. 843. CANAL BOATS, ENGLAND.

In accordance with Section 3 of the Canal Boats Act, 1884, I beg to present herewith the Annual Report on the working of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations within the district of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, during the year ended 31st December, 1925. The Acts and Regulations apply within the whole of the district under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, including the River and Docks, as a "canal" for the purposes of the Act " includes any river, inland navigation, lake, or water being within the body of a county, whether it is or not within the ebb or flow of the tide." The navigation, in addition to the enclosed Docks, includes the following navigable tributary waters and creeks of the River Thames:— On the right bank— On the left bank— From Teddington downwards From Teddington downwards:— Wandsworth Creek (River Wandle). The entrance of the River Brent. Hay's Dock. Hammersmith Creek. St. Saviour's Dock. Chelsea Dock. Part of the Grand Surrey Canal within the Grosvenor Dock. Surrey Commercial Dock. Limekiln Creek. Deadman's Dock. Bow Creek (River Lea). Deptford Creek (River Ravensbourne). Barking Creek (River Roding) Dartford Creek (Rivers Cray and Darenth). Rainham Creek (River Ingrebourne). The entrance to Gravesend Canal. Mucking Creek. Cliffe Creek. Thames Haven. Yantlet and Coalmouth Creeks. Hole Haven. Part of the River Medway, and of the Swale. Havengore Creek. River Roach as far as Rochford. 72 RIVER. The whole of this area is divided into three districts, known as Upper, Middle and Lower, each district being in charge of an Inspector, as follows:— Upper District.— Teddington to Greenwich Inspector Coombe,£l 50 per annum. Middle District.— Greenwich to Erith Ditto. Lower District.— Erith to seaward limits of the Port of London (including part of the River Medway) Inspector Berry, £260 per annum. The docks are divided into four districts, known as the Central, Eastern, Western and the Gravesend District. Central District.— West India Dock Inspector Elward, £280 per annum. South-West India Dock Poplar Dock Millwall Dock Eastern District.— Royal Victoria Dock Inspector Clifford, £150 per annum. Inspector Lambe, £280 per annum. East India Dock Royal Albert Dock King George V. Dock Western District.— London Dock Inspector Gray, £160 per annum. St. Katharine Dock Regent's Dock Surrey Commercial Dock Gravesend District.— Tilbury Dock Inspector Massie, £270 per annum. Left Shore, from Purfleet down Right Shore, from Erith down (2) The total number of inspections for the year was 280, representing a nett number of 125 boats. The remainder 155 represents repeated visits by Inspectors of this Authority. The number of boats not conforming to the Acts and Regulations was 86 (inspected on 106 occasions, or 37.85 per cent. of the total inspections, the percentage for the previous five years being 33.60 per cent.) In addition to the above, 40 boats were at the time of visit found with the cabin door locked, there being no persons on board. Inspection was therefore impossible, and these visits are not included in the number of boats inspected. (3) With reference to the various infringements of the Act :— 1625 Unregistered Boats.
