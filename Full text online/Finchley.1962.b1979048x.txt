MAY 4 Telephone No.: FINchley 0018 Public Health Department, 308, Regents Park Road, Finchley, N.3. TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE BOROUGH OF FINCHLEY. In accordance with my statutory duty as your Medical Officer of Health I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year 1962. This report is prepared according to the Ministry of Health circular 1/63 and preceding relevant circulars. The year under review on the whole was very interesting from the point of view of happenings both in the Public Health field and in the Local Government field generally. In the Public Health field the Council accepted the principle of fluoridation of the water supplies in an effort to prevent the high incidence of dental caries from which this country suffers. Unfortunately the implementation of the Council's policy lies in other hands and I am afraid that fluoridation of our water supplies, despite the necessary haste, will be tied to the movements of other bodies which are not renowned for their speed. I refer once more to the problem of the aged being one of the most difficult with which this Department has to deal and which will undoubtedly increase unless action is taken now and quickly to prepare for the years ahead. The problems of the aged are due to many factors; poor health, housing, loneliness, etc., but more generally a number of factors. Fortunately, in Finchley we have a wealth of voluntary effort, but unfortunately a lack of trained personnel. This is not peculiar to Finchley but is general over the country as a whole. One of the greatest difficulties in dealing with the aged is the multiplicity of agencies, both statutory and voluntary, with no one body able to accept full responsibility for dealing with all aspects of the situation. Here, in my opinion, lies the solution to a problem which is becoming more acute. The establishment of day centres for the accommodation of homebound aged during the normal working day, thereby releasing members of their households to pursue wage-earning activities, offers some solution to part of the problem, and the advent of the National Assistance Act, 1948 (Amendment) Act, 1962, has opened the way to local authorities to provide some measure of help for the aged. As a result of this Act, the Public Health Committee have considered the establishment of a Day Centre/Workshop at a site in Ballards Lane. This Centre will, I trust, incorporate a preventative geriatric clinic and chiropody clinics and will be available to all aged persons in the Borough. An important side effect may be to relieve pressure on hospital beds and places in old people's homes. Undoubtedly the highlight of the year was the London Government Bill on the Reorganisation of Local Government in London whereby Barnet, East Barnet, Finchley, 5 Friern Barnet and Hendon are to be amalgamated into one unit setting up a Borough with a population of some 318,000. This project is, of course, unwelcome in many quarters, but from the Public Health point of view it will certainly make the services much more local than they are at the moment, and therefore be of benefit to these services. VITAL STATISTICS: The Registrar-General's estimate at 30th June, 1962, showed an increaesd in population—69,150 compared to 68,890 in 1961. The number of inhabited dwellings as at 1st April, 1962, showed an increase of 240 to 21,560 reflecting a further fractional but pleasing reduction in the number of occupants per dwelling. One hundred and twenty-nine more babies were born in Finchley in 1962— 1,118 compared to 989 in the previous year, giving a birth rate of 15.5 per 1,000 population compared to the national average of 18.0. I am pleased to record a decrease in infant mortality from 23.3 per 1,000 live births in 1961 to 13.4 in 1962 compared with the provisional figure of 21.4 for England and Wales. Of the total number of 15 infant deaths, 11 occurred in the first week of life. The death rate of 11.8 per 1,000 population was lower than that of 1961, i.e., 815 compared to 847; the largest decrease being in the age group 25 and under 45 years. Once again the major causes of death were diseases of the heart and blood vessels followed closely by cancer of various types. Cancer of the lung showed a slight decrease from 39 deaths in 1961 to 36 deaths in 1962, approximately 50% of which occurred in the age group 45 to 65 years, and further indicating the need for more publicity emphasising the dangers of cigarette smoking. COMMUNICABLE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: The threat of smallpox which began in December, 1961, continued into March of this year and the Department was extremely busy in connection with the distribution of vaccine lymph, the tracing of contacts and the visiting of suspected cases which, in the main, turned out to be chicken pox or allergic skin conditions. Fortunately no actual cases occurred in Finchley. An outbreak of influenza unfortunately coincided with our smallpox scare and resulted in the General Practitioners being badly overworked during this period. March and April saw an outbreak of mumps. There were no cases of poliomyelitis notified during the year, although a number of suspected cases were investigated. This is a very happy position and I believe we are now obtaining the benefit of the poliomyelitis vaccines which have been in use for a number of years. Oral vaccine against poliomyelitis was made available to selected groups in February of this year. 6 Food poisoning showed a total of 20 cases, one less than reported last year. Further details of the various illnesses met with during the year can be read later in this report. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES: There is very little to report on the routine sanitary work which goes on from day to day, year to year without, seemingly, the recognition which is its due. Information concerning the activities of the Public Health Inspectors has been supplied to me in detail by Mr. Gray, Chief Public Health Inspector, and is contained in the body of my Report. Some 18,534 visits were made by your Public Health Inspectors in connection with all sorts of complaints and in the course of routine inspections. Smoke Control areas proceeded apace and by October, 1962, a large portion of the southern part of the Borough was under Smoke Control Orders, and I am sure that we are obtaining the benefit of these Smoke Control Areas (details of the areas may be found on page 44). The expected date by which the whole Borough will be smoke free is 1968 instead of the originally estimated date of 1970. CONCLUSION: This is my fifth and last Report for the Borough of Finchley as I am taking up a new appointment in the Department of Health in Ireland, and I should like to express my gratitude to the Public Health Committee and the Council members who made my period here so contented. I would also express my thanks to the staff of the Public Health Department for their loyalty and fidelity in helping me to carry out the duties of the Department. Finally, this Report could not be compiled without the help of my fellow Chief Officers, who have been most gracious to me during my stay in Finchley, and to all others who have contributed to this Report I duly express my thanks. I am, Your obedient servant, J. G. HAGAN, Medical Officer of Health. 7 Acknowledgments to:— The Chief Officers of the Council— The Town Clerk—R. M. Franklin, Esq. The Borough Engineer and Surveyor—P.

More manual workers are now settling in the district but again most of the skilled workers travel to the more industrialised areas of Wembley, Colindale, Wood Green, etc. The percentage of unemployed workers to the employed population is not known, but it is believed to be well below the national percentage. Unemployment usually reaches its lowest point in June of each year, normally rising again after Christmas and then starting to decrease in March. Figures for Finchley are not available, but the following table shows the number of unemployed adult persons, i.e., aged 18 and over, for the Finchley and Friern Barnet areas:— 1960 1961 1962 June December June December June December Men 142 151 102 182 184 281 Women 22 19 5 23 47 52 Total 164 170 107 205 231 333 The registers in December, 1962, have considerably increased in comparison with previous years, but this has been general in most parts of the country, and the rise has not been so marked in this district as in many other areas. In 1962 the children who represent the peak of the "Bulge" in Finchley and Friern Barnet reached the statutory school leaving age. Because of the increased tendency to stay at school voluntarily beyond this age, however, the number of actual leavers was no greater than in 1961. As in other years, many boys and girls looked to neighbouring suburban areas and Central London for employment but in all these areas as well as locally there was a marked reduction in the number of vacancies available, and the rate at which school leavers were absorbed into employment was slower than in 1961. On the 10th September, 21 July school leavers were still registered as unemployed, and 8 on the 15th October. The employment situation for the boys who left school at Christmas was more difficult than it had been for some years. The number of Christmas school leavers was 124 (64 boys and 60 girls). The girls all obtained jobs quite quickly but 4 boys were still unemployed almost 8 weeks after leaving school. On the dates nearest to the end of the year on which counts were made, the total number of young people registered as unemployed was 48 (34 boys and 14 girls), and there were 116 unfilled vacancies (55 for boys and 61 for girls). 19 The kinds of employment entered by the largest numbers of girls were office work, shopwork and hairdressing (in that order). The kinds of employment entered by the largest numbers of boys were engineering, shopwork, office work, building and electrical contracting. ROAD SAFETY The following tables show the number of road traffic accidents and casualties within the Borough during 1962 and comparative figures for the past five years. The figures supplied by the Registrar-General, shown in the list of causes of death on page 14, refer to Finchley residents only regardless of place of death, and therefore may not agree with the number of fatalities shown below.

However, the last two months of the year produced such a variety of road and weather conditions that the total figures were forced up until eventually the reduction in accidents was one as compared with 1961. December in particular, proved a most difficult month to the motorist and road-user generally. Two pleasing features present themselves: The total number of older people (over 60) shows a reduction of 11 as compared with the previous year, i.e., a reduction of approximately 20% in the Borough. The other feature is the appreciable drop in the number of motor cyclists involved in accidents, particularly in the teenage group. In this age group, there was a reduction of approximately 50% which may be an indication that recent regulations restricting learner drivers to smaller machines, are proving effective. 21 INFECTIOUS DISEASES The following table shows the number of cases notified during the past five years:— 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 Diphtheria - - - - - Dysentery 4 12 45 13 17 Encephalitis - - — 2 -- Erysipelas 4 1 2 2 1 Food Poisoning 3 13 4 17 7 Measles 206 602 74 1173 150 Meningococcal Infections - - 1 1 - Ophthalmia Neonatorum 4 2 1 2 2 Paratyphoid Fever - 4 1 - - Pneumonia 35 35 12 8 3 Poliomyelitis - 5 - - - Puerperal Pyrexia 29 30 26 25 23 Scarlet Fever 58 27 19 18 9 Smallpox — - — - - Typhoid Fever - - - — - Whooping Cough 22 7 25 11 2 Figures concerning notified cases of Tuberculosis will be found on page 25.

Three hundred and thirty-two children were given "booster" doses of diphtheria prophylactic alone and 4 were given "booster" doses of combined diphtheria and whooping cough prophylactic. 22 Scarlet Fever There were 9 cases of Scarlet Fever, nine less than in the previous year. The known cases were mild in character and there is little doubt that in a number of others the illness was so slight as to escape detection altogether. There were no deaths. Poliomyelitis No case of Poliomyelitis occurred during the year. Early in 1960 it was decided to extend poliomyelitis vaccination to persons under the age of 40. Hitherto vaccination could only be obtained by persons under the age of 26 and certain special groups such as Health Visitors and Public Health Inspectors. In 1961 arrangements for poliomyelitis vaccination were extended to include a reinforcing fourth dose; Ministry of Health Circular No. 15/61 asked specifically for arrangements to be made to offer such a dose to children when they enter school (normally at the age of 5), to children of 5 and over already at school who have not reached the age of 12 and to all children of similar ages who are not attending school. During the year oral vaccine was made available for the immunisation of persons eligible under approved Local Health Authority arrangements, i.e., the "priority groups" namely those over six months and under 40 years of age and certain others at special risk. The number of persons vaccinated in Finchley during 1962 is shown as follows:— By General By Middlesex Practitioners County Council 1. Number of persons who received one reinforcing dose 1,472 562 2. Number of children aged 5-12 years who received a second reinforcing dose 328 446 3. Number of persons who completed a primary course of oral vaccination 144 274 Measles The number of notifications was 150 compared with 1,173 in 1961. There were no deaths. Whooping Cough The notifications numbered 2 in 1962 and there were no deaths. During the year, one child was immunised by a General Practitioner. 23 Pneumonia Only two forms of pneumonia, namely, acute primary and influenzal, are notifiable. Three such cases were reported to me during the year. In the table of deaths, all forms of pneumonia are included in the classification (No. 23). It will be seen that 47 deaths occurred and of these 43 were persons of 65 years of age and over. Puerperal Pyrexia "Puerperal Pyrexia" means any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100.4° Fahrenheit (38° Centigrade) or more has occurred within fourteen days after childbirth or miscarriage. Notification is required to be made to the Medical Officer of Health of the district where the patient is when the disease is diagnosed. Of the 23 cases notified to me during the year, one was a home confinement and a Finchley resident and the remainder occurred in the North Middlesex Hospital Annexe in The Bishop's Avenue and were residents of other districts. Food Poisoning Seven persons were notified as suffering from food poisoning during the year, and in addition 13 cases were otherwise ascertained. The causative organisms identified were as follows:— Salmonella bredeney 5 Salmonella durham 1 Salmonella heidelberg 1 Salmonella typhimurium 6 Staphylococci 3 Esch. Coli 1 Not identified 3 Dysentery Seventeen cases of dysentery were notified and all were investigated and the persons concerned advised on how to prevent the spread of this infection. Fortunately it is a mild infection as a rule, although the illness can be severe in infants and in the aged. It tends to become epidemic in schools, hospitals, nurseries or camps. Its prevention is simple, i.e., the teaching of hand washing in schools and an improvement in the general standard of hygiene in the home. Typhoid and Paratyphoid There were no cases of Typhoid or Paratyphoid during the year. 24 VACCINATION AGAINST SMALLPOX The number of persons vaccinated for the first time by General Practitioners and Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority was three thousand nine hundred and twenty-one. Ten thousand two hundred and thirty-two were re-vaccinated. INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATES OF VACCINATION Persons travelling to certain foreign countries must produce a certificate of vaccination or inoculation completed by their own medical practitioners. In several countries certificates are not accepted unless they are endorsed by a medical officer in the government or local authority of the country of issue. A form of authentication which has been accepted by the health authorities abroad is that given by public health authorities and identified by a rubber stamp impression on the certificate. The rubber stamp in this office bears the words "Finchley Corporation—Signature of doctor authenticated." The purpose of the authentication is to provide proof that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. During the year 5,215 certificates were authenticated. TUBERCULOSIS Two persons died from tuberculosis during 1962, giving a death rate of 0.03 per 1,000 population. Twenty-six new cases were notified, seven less than in the previous year. The case rate per 1,000 population was 0.38. The following table shows the number of notifications and the number of deaths during the past 10 years:— Year New Cases Deaths Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M. F. M. F. M. F. M.

Smear — 15 Other Organisms 6 155 391 RESEARCH In my Annual Report for 1961 I gave a brief summary of the contents of a joint report published in the "Lancet" on the 17th February, 1962, on "Pet Foods and Garden Fertilisers as Sources of Human Salmonellosis." The survey was enlarged to include cloacal swabs of poultry, the object being to determine the proportion of birds infected with salmonellae. The interim report shows that from February, 1961, to June, 1962, 1,176 swabs were taken in Hendon and Finchley and in 24 (2%) cases salmonellae were isolated. Of the total number of swabs taken, 109 were of ducks from which salmonella typhi-murium was isolated in 21 (19%) cases. The conclusions drawn were that the practice of eviscerating ducks in retail shops may be an important source of human salmonellosis, and it was resolved to continue the survey in order to demonstrate any human disease associated with poultry infection. HEALTH EDUCATION The Council is in a position of considerable responsibility in the field of health education and the subject is of such importance as to warrant the appointment of a specialist to the department. However, the Public Health Inspectors by virtue of their close contact with many aspects of the life of the general public, arc able to promote health education, including home safety. In addition to home visits, publicity by pamphlet and poster, etc., a number of talks were given by myself and other members of the staff to schools and other organisations. 26 The report published by the Royal College of Physicians in 1962 assessed the evidence about the relationship of smoking and health and concluded that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer and bronchitis and probably contributes to the development of coronary heart disease and various other less common diseases. The Minister of Health in his circular No. 6/62, considered that health education should increasingly emphasise the risks of smoking and he asked Councils to use all their channels of health education to make the conclusions of the report widely known and to bring home to the public the dangers to health of smoking, particularly cigarettes. It was also emphasised in the report that this effort would probably bear most fruit if education was undertaken in the schools before the children had had an opportunity to acquire the habit or of becoming addicted to it. To augment the publicity campaign, the Central Council for Health Education has made available to local authorities mobile units equipped with visual aids and staffed by two male graduate lecturers specially trained and briefed to deliver talks on the topic of smoking and health. Finchley Borough Council has taken advantage of this offer and a programme, consisting of 22 sessions at schools and youth clubs, has been arranged for 1963. MASS RADIOGRAPHY The Mass Radiography Unit 5B visited Finchley during 1961 and a report on the survey was included in my Annual Report for that year. It is understood that arrangements will be made for a further survey in 1964. LAUNDRY SERVICE FOR THE INCONTINENT The laundry service, introduced in 1957 to assist in the problems concerning incontinent persons, operates in accordance with the provisions of Section 42 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1956. The washing machine is installed at the Disinfecting Station and arrangements are made for articles to be collected and delivered on Tuesday and Friday of each week. The cost of the service is borne by the local authority. The number of persons receiving assistance at the beginning of the year 3 The number of persons for whom the service was recommended and subsequently authorised by the Medical Officer of Health or by the Public Health Inspectors during the year 13 The number of persons receiving assistance at the end of the year 10 During 1962, 645 collections of articles were made. 27 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948—SECTION 47 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951 Removal to Suitable Premises of Persons in need of care and attention Provision is made under Section 47 for securing the necessary care and attention for persons who— (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions, and (b) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. A number of cases, mainly elderly persons living in poor conditions, were brought to my notice but with the help of the social and visiting services and voluntary admission to hospital or home, each case resolved itself and I am pleased to report that it was not necessary to invoke the provisions of the Section. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948—SECTION 50 Burial or Cremation of the Dead It is the duty of the Local Authority to cause to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died or been found dead in the area, in any case where it appears to the Authority that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have been or are being otherwise made. The expenses incurred may be recovered from the estate of the deceased person, by death grant subject to the contribution conditions being satisfied or from any person who for the purposes of the Act was liable to maintain the deceased person immediately before his death. Any person who has died or been found dead in these circumstances in Finchley is buried in the St. Pancras Cemetery. One burial was carried out by the Council during the year. BURIAL ACT, 1857 Licences for the removal of human remains under the above Act state, inter alia, "It is considered advisable that the Medical Officer of Health should be notified whenever such a licence is granted in order that he may be in a position to take (under his general powers) any action that may appear to him to be necessary in the interests of public health." Three copies of licences for such removals were received from the Home Office during the year. The exhumations were carried out in the early hours of the morning and were visited when necessary by a public health inspector, to ensure compliance with the conditions of the licences. 28 MORTUARY The Council provide a mortuary under the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1936, and from time to time the Coroner, whose district includes Finchley, uses his power in Section 24 of the Coroner's Amendment Act, 1926, to direct that bodies from the Potters Bar and Friern Barnet Urban Districts, which are also within his district, shall be taken to the Finchley mortuary. One hundred and ninety bodies were received into the mortuary during 1962 and of these, 38 were from Friern Barnet and 15 from Potters Bar. Post Mortem examinations were carried out in all cases. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS Thirty-seven persons were examined on appointment to the Council's stall and 1 workman was examined with a view to his admission to the Council's Sickness Pay Scheme. In addition, 9 elderly employees were examined for proposed extension of service. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply The water supply to all dwellings in the Borough is direct from the public water mains and, during the year, was satisfactory in quality and quantity. The bulk of the water is supplied by the Lee Valley Water Company. Four hundred and forty bacteriological and 19 chemical samples of water supplied to the district were examined by the Company and were reported to conform to standards of purity considered suitable for public supply. With regard to the standards by which the degree of purity of the water supply is measured, I give below an extract from a letter from the Chief Chemist and Bacteriologist of the Lee Valley Water Company:— "Bacteriologically the standard aimed at is that coli-aerogenes and Eschericia coli should be absent from 100 ml in all samples, and in a sample from the distribution system this implies correct treatment of the original raw water, and that no secondary contamination of the supply via a leaking reservoir or water tower roof, etc., has arisen. "It is somewhat more difficult to give a chemical definition as there are no generally accepted standards by which measurement is made. However, my own interpretation is that the sample shall contain no excess of saline or mineral matter in solution or in suspension, and one which contains no more than acknowledged harmless traces of organic matter or heavy metals. To illustrate the point, all the Company's waters contain harmless traces of nitrate. There is at the same time a significant connection between nitrate and methaemoglobinacmia and in the event of detecting 29 nitrate upwards of 15.0 p.pm or so in a sample however satisfactory in all other respects, I would not regard it as conforming to suitable standards. "I confirm that every chemical sample we examine is tested for lead, copper, zinc and iron. An unobjectionable trace of iron, in most cases picked up from the mains, is frequently found, but the other three metals are invariably absent. The water is not plumbo-solvent and lead pipes have been widely used for very many years throughout the whole of the Barnet Divisional area with every satisfaction." Sewerage and Sewage Disposal Finchley has been properly sewered for many years but there have recently been certain additions to the system to provide for new development as on the land at the rear of Nazareth House, East End Road, and adjacent to Woodside House, High Road and Totteridge Lane, N.20. At the time of writing this note, it is hoped that all the sewage from Finchley which drains to the Sewage Disposal Works will soon be diverted to the East Middlesex Main Drainage system. In the meantime, the Sewage Works are being made to operate as well as practicable in the face of enormous difficulties, particularly with regard to the digestion and disposal of sludge. The plant which has been seriously overloaded has been gradually failing and only constant vigilance of the staff has made it at all possible to maintain reasonable conditions. Periodic tests are carried out on the effluent from the Works by the Lee Valley Conservancy Board as well as by the Corporation's own consultant chemists. I am grateful to Mr. P. M. Spencer, the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, for this information. Housing I refer again to the housing of elderly persons and, with the kind assistance of the Borough Housing Officer, I give details of the Council's activities in this connection. Although it is only in recent years that the Government has urged local authorities to provide this type of accommodation as a major part of their building programme, the Finchley Council has been concerned in the housing of elderly persons for some considerable time and has used ordinary one-bedroom Council dwellings for this purpose. In 1962, 32 purpose-built units and 7 units from conversions were provided. Plans for the provision of further elderly persons' accommodation, both purposebuilt and conversions, are in hand and it is hoped in a short while that approximately 240 units (including the ordinary one-bedroom Council dwellings referred to above) will be providing accommodation for elderly persons. With regard to "handicapped" persons, I would add that many of these are included in the elderly persons who have been allocated ground floor accommodation. Also, the Council has already provided a purpose-built bungalow which houses husband 30 and wife, who are both handicapped, and provision has been made for two more such bungalows in another stage of the development in the same area. The Public Health Department continued to be actively concerned with housing applications, in some cases supported by medical certificates, referred by the Borough Housing Officer for consideration of additional points on medical grounds. Additional points awarded:— Points Award Number of Applicants 1 6 2 4 3 10 4 3 5 (maximum) 10 In addition, observations were requested on a number of applications in respect of the sanitary circumstances and state of overcrowding. In special cases where the medical conditions merited urgent rehousing but the award of "additional points" did not give immediate help the matter was submitted to the Housing Committee, the medical report being considered in each case.

It was proposed to deal with six of the houses as a Clearance Area and the remainder as individual unfit houses. In this connection the following premises have been dealt with:— Clearance Area No. 17 Nos. 137-147 (odd), East End Road, N.2 (6 houses). In 1961 this area was represented to the Council and was declared a Clearance Area under Part III of the Housing Act, 1957. An Order was made and was subsequently confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government. 32 The tenants were rehoused by the Council and the houses were demolished in 1962. No. 9, Lodge Lane, N.12. A Closing Order was made and confirmed by the Council in 1961 and the occupant was rehoused by the Council in an old person's flatlet during 1962. Nos. 1 & 2, Fleming Cottages, Great North Road, N.2, and No. 38, Lichfield Grove, N.3. These houses were dealt with informally during 1961 when demolition was secured by consultation with the owners. No. 1303, High Road, N.20. A Closing Order was made and confirmed in 1962 and the occupants were subsequently rehoused by the Council. Alpha Cottage, Minerva Cottage, Ivy House, Stanley Villa, Hillside Cottage, Rose Villa, Cherry Tree Cottage, 8, Cherry Tree Hill, 1, Dixey Cottages, 2, Dixey Cottages, Great North Road, N.2 (10 houses). A survey of these premises was made and details thereof together with the official representations were prepared ready for submission to the Public Health Committee early in the new year. Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958—Section 43 This Section deals with the power of local authorities to make advances to any person for the purpose of:— (a) acquiring houses; (b) constructing houses; (c) converting into houses buildings which have been acquired by those persons or acquiring buildings and converting them into houses; (d) altering, enlarging, repairing or improving houses; whether the houses or buildings are within or without the district of the authority or council. One hundred and seventy-four enquiries were dealt with regarding premises which were the subject of applications for advances under this Section. Rent Act, 1957 This Act came into operation on the 6th July, 1957, and since this date the number of applications for certificates of disrepair has continued to decrease, as will be seen below. 1957 (approximate 6 months) 60 applications 1958 50 applications 1959 14 applications 1960 8 applications 1961 3 applications 1962 Nil 33 Complaints One thousand three hundred and thirty-six complaints and requests for services were received with reference to the following matters, viz.:— Absence of, or defective condition of, dustbins 9 Accumulations of refuse and manure 38 Blocked or defective drains 395 Defective roofs 29 Defective W.C.s 18 Dirty milk bottles 4 Flooding 6 Foreign matter in food 6 Insanitary or defective condition of houses 87 Noise 14 Non-removal of refuse 10 Nuisances from dampness 35 Nuisances from the burning of refuse 27 Nuisances from the keeping of animals or poultry 4 Sewage Works 10 Pigeons 2 Smoke nuisances 31 Unsatisfactory Housing Conditions, including Overcrowding 10 Unsound Food 16 Verminous condition of houses 5 Premises infected with other insects 43 Wasps' nests 114 Bees 20 Premises infested with rats or mice 296 Other complaints 107 Inspections The total number of inspections made during the year was 18,534. At 345 of the houses and other premises visited, defects or nuisances to the number of 1,157 were discovered. At the end of the year 807 had been remedied or abated and the work in connection with 23 was in hand. In order to ascertain that the sanitary defects were being properly remedied, 461 visits were paid to the respective premises while the work was in progress. The total number of inspections made in regard to each section of work is recorded below, together with a summary of the sanitary improvements carried out:— Inspections under Housing Acts 188 Other Inspections including Inspections under Public Health Acts 3,262 34 Re-Inspections 2,020 Rent Act, 1957 10 Works in Progress 461 Factories and Workplaces (including Bakehouses and Restaurant Kitchens) 336 Slaughterhouse 5 Cowsheds, Dairies and Milkshops 11 Ice Cream Premises 29 Meat, Fish and Other Food Shops 499 Shops (Shops Act) 237 Infectious Disease 210 Rodent Control 1,253 Overcrowding 37 Hawkers 57 Hairdressers' Premises 29 Pet Animals Act, 1951 12 Heating Appliances — Clean Air Act, 1956 (including Smoke Control Survey) 9,318 Miscellaneous 560 18,534 Notices Served Informal Notices 344 Statutory Notices 14 Legal Proceedings No legal proceedings were taken under this section of the report during the year, the necessary work being carried out by the person(s) responsible or in their default by the Council under the relevant provisions.

It was found that the home conditions were quite satisfactory. The following table shows, by trades, the number of outworkers residing in the district, and who were notified to me in the August lists as required by Section 133 (1) (c) of the Factories Act, 1961:— Wearing apparel 24 Curtains and furniture hanging 1 Lampshades 2 Making of brushes 1 Making of boxes 3 Household Linen 4 There were no cases of default in sending lists to the Council (Section 133) and no instances of work in unwholesome premises (Section 134). Sanitary Conveniences There are 32 conveniences attached to public houses within the Borough. These premises are inspected periodically. There are 15 public conveniences in the Borough, including those in recreation grounds. Fourteen of these conveniences provide accommodation for both sexes and one for males only. Places of Public Entertainment The cinemas, dance halls and other places of public entertainment have been inspected, special attention being given to the condition and adequacy of the sanitary accommodation. Four defects were discovered as a result of these inspections and were remedied after notice had been given to the person responsible. Twenty-one premises were inspected and a report was submitted to the Middlesex County Council which is the licensing authority. Swimming Pools Finchley has two Swimming Pools, Squires Lane Baths and the Open Air Pools in the High Road, N.12. The latter comprises Adult and Children's Pools and is said to be one of the finest examples in the London Area. I am grateful to Mr. P. M. Spencer, the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, under whose control the baths are operated, for the following report:— 40 "Both establishments are equipped with modern filtration and chlorination plants. The water is drawn from the public water supply and is continuously filtered on a six-hour cycle, make-up water being added as necessary to cover losses by evaporation, filter washing and other causes. The chlorination is controlled in accordance with the latest practice in this important subject. "Samples of the water are taken regularly for bacteriological examination and the results are consistently satisfactory. This reflects greatly to the credit of the staff directly concerned with the operation of the purification plants, for the bathing load is frequently heavy. In the 1962 season, 282,737 people visited the pools." Eighty-eight samples of the water were taken by the Public Health Inspectors during the year. RODENT CONTROL The form in which the statistics in this Section is reported has been amended so as to bring it into line with the data in the Report to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

Number of infested properties (in 3 above) treated by Local Authority 23 168 42 233 Of the 259 premises at which evidence of infestation by rats or mice was found, 37 were shop or factory premises. Poultry was kept at 10 addresses only. In 3 cases smoke tests were applied to rat runs and as a result defects in drains or sewers were revealed in each case. The necessary remedial works were carried out. 41 Treatment of Sewers The 31st and 32nd maintenance treatments of sewers were carried out in May and October respectively when baits of oiled warfarin incorporating a mould inhibitor were used. Of 42 manholes in which there was evidence of rat infestation in May, all were cleared of infestation when rechecked with test baits in October, having been baited to extinction in the earlier treatment. In order to undertake the treatment of sewers it is necessary to have the temporary use of men and equipment from the Department of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, to whom I am grateful for co-operation. The amount of work involved is shown below:— May, 1962 October, 1962 Total number of manholes baited 742 646 Number of poison "takes" 42 13 It is important to keep the rat population in the sewers at as low a level as possible so as to limit the possibility of surface infestation. When buildings are demolished prior to new development, rats may escape from a sewer by way of severed drains, and though every effort is made to have connections sealed off at the time of demolition, works of excavation may subsequently open up the drain and leave a possible source of future surface infestation. 42 CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 The above Act deals with the control of dark smoke, smoke from furnaces, smoke control areas and special cases of smoke emission, which include special processes to be dealt with under the Alkali Act, colliery spoil-banks, railway engines, vessels and Crown premises. It also makes provision for the establishment of a Clean Air Council for England and Wales. Certain sections of the Act came into operation on the 31st December, 1956, including those relating to the height of chimneys and to smoke control areas. The remaining provisions came into operation on the 1st June, 1958, and included those relating to the prohibition of dark smoke from chimneys, measures for dealing with grit and dust from furnaces, abatement of smoke nuisances and the application of the Act to railway engines, vessels and Crown premises. With regard to the making of smoke control areas, any local authority may make an Order, which must be confirmed by the Minister declaring the whole or any part of its district as a smoke control area. Subject to any stated exceptions and limitations, the emission of chimney smoke in such an area, on any day, is an offence unless the emission was caused only by the burning of an authorised fuel. If the owner or occupier of a private dwelling which is in, or will be in, a smoke control area, has to incur expenditure for adapting his heating arrangements the local authority shall repay him seven-tenths of the cost, four-tenths of which is recoverable from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. In 1958, the Council passed a resolution to make the whole of the Borough a smoke control area within 10 years and in 1959, at the request of the Minister of Housing and Local Government, submitted their proposals for the first five years. The Council decided that all that portion of the Borough, lying to the south of the railway line from the Borough boundary in the west to the North Circular Road, and thcnce south of the North Circular Road to the Borough boundary in the east should be included in this programme. It will be seen from the following statement that 42% of the total area of the Borough, will be a smoke control area by 1st October, 1963. It is pleasing to report in connection with all areas submitted to the Minister to date, that no objections have been received necessitating a public inquiry and each area has been approved without amendment. In addition to the publicity required by statute, the Council's policy with regard to Clean Air and Smoke Control programme has been widely circulated and also, during the year, lectures were given by members of the staff to organisations in the district. Further information was made available to the public by the Mobile Exhibition Unit of the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation which was stationed at various sites. 43 Area of the Borough 3,478 Total number of properties as at 1st April, 1963 25,937 Areas in operation Area.

Thirty-one complaints were received during the year concerning industrial and domestic chimneys. In addition, 27 complaints were received with regard to the burning of garden and other refuse and action was taken in a number of cases where it was considered that burning was habitual and causing a nuisance. A considerable number of installations, both industrial and domestic, are still being converted or installed for oil burning. In a number of instances, where plans had been submitted, it was necessary to ask for the height of the chimneys to be increased. Many enquiries are received by the Petroleum Inspector from persons desirous of installing oil fired plant and regarding the safe storage of the oil and whilst advice is freely given it is sometimes not accepted and in the absence of legistlation, requirements considered necessary cannot be enforced. Atmospheric Pollution The deposit guages have now been replaced by volumetric apparatus for the determination of smoke and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere. The measurements of pollution recorded during 1962 are shown in the table below followed by graphs indicating the average and highest values of concentration at all sites, and for the purpose of comparison the concentration at the Public Health Department only during the years 1961 and 1962. The term "smoke" is used to denote all fine suspended impurity in the atmosphere which is collected by a test filter and assessed by means of a Reflectometer. "Sulphur Dioxide" includes all acid-producing gases in the air with the exception of carbon dioxide and is the "net acidity" of the air calculated as sulphur dioxide. 47 Concentration of Smoke and Sulphur Dioxide - 1962 MONTH SMOKE SULPHUR DIOXIDE (SO²) RATIO SMOKE TO SO2 MICROGRAMMES PER CUBIC METRE AVERAGE VALUE HIGHEST VALUE LOWEST VALUE AVERAGE VALUE HIGHEST VALUE LOWEST VALUE 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 January 138 124 231 459 372 461 35 30 81 208 177 268 606 505 585 96 76 114 .66 .70 .86 February 108 114 160 420 437 485 32 29 28 177 163 195 492 587 503 82 45 39 .61 .70 .82 March 134 123 153 346 323 408 42 16 30 237 199 218 562 484 632 99 63 63 .57 .62 .70 April 56 63 90 123 167 294 31 9 12 117 98 118 225 199 347 58 28 31 .48 .64 .76 May 44 40 41 145 146 146 16 6 17 93 54 81 287 229 241 46 0 24 .47 .74 .51 June 23 — 23 42 41 55 10 2 10 77 — 67 143 88 128 37 0 34 .30 — .32 July 30 37 30 75 100 74 10 18 8 69 63 68 121 169 177 31 19 24 .43 .59 .44 August 26 36 25 67 75 58 15 16 12 62 51 61 130 99 122 32 25 25 .42 .71 .41 September 47 56 51 126 119 111 20 15 23 90 87 95 248 228 280 34 30 31 .52 .64 .54 October 112 121 — 342 391 349 39 55 65 188 177 — 413 487 433 100 58 54 .60 .68 — November 157 177 176 328 355 304 45 33 38 266 269 275 494 608 534 103 64 72 .59 .66 .64 December 286 251 288 1452 949 1428 50 72 80 563 501 460 2739 2214 2041 66 51 100 .51 .50 .63 (1) Public Health Department, 308 Regents Park Road, N.3.

These food hygiene regulations lay down requirements in respect of the cleanliness of food premises and stalls, and of apparatus and equipment, the hygienic handling of food, the cleanliness of persons engaged in the handling of food and of their clothing, and the action to be taken where they suffer from or are carriers of certain infections; the construction of food premises, their repair and maintenance and the facilities including sinks and wash basins to be provided; and the temperature at which certain foods are to be kept. 1. Number of Inspections: The Public Health Inspectors continued a systematic inspection of food premises and during the year, 1,196 visits were made to shops and other premises in order to ascertain compliance with the Regulations, and arising therefrom 153 contraventions were found, and 35 letters sent and 39 verbal notices given in connection therewith. The following is a summary of the works done during the year:— Chopping blocks provided 1 Cleaning and redecorating carried out 44 Display protection provided 1 First Aid Material provided 2 Floor laid or repaired 4 Flues made good 1 Furniture repaired 1 Gully dishing repaired 1 Lavatory basins provided 3 Nailbrushes provided 1 Oven renewed 1 Refrigerators provided 2 Roof repaired 1 Shop front provided 2 Sinks provided 2 Tiles repaired 2 Towel provided 2 Waste bins provided 8 (Paper sacks provided instead of waste bins) 58 Waste pipe repaired 1 W.C. apartments provided 1 W.C. cistern provided or repaired 1 W.C. notices provided 1 W.C. pans provided 1 Windows repaired 1 2.

The number and type of food premises registered under Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955:— (a) Sale of Ice Cream 155 (b) Manufacture of Sausages 38 (c) Cooking of Hams 9 (d) Pickling of Meat 18 (e) Preparation of pickled and preserved food 7 (f) Cooking of Poultry 2 Total 229 Butchers' Shops There were 45 butchers' shops in the district, all of which are provided with glass fronts. All these premises have been visited and the provision of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations which provide for the cleanliness of the premises, apparatus, utensils and vehicles, the precautions to be taken against the contamination of meat, the storage and removal of refuse, etc., have generally been well observed. Bakehouses The number of bakehouses in the Borough was 17. At 16 bakehouses motive power is used. 59 The bakehouses have been visited by the Public Health Inspectors and steps have been taken to cause them to be maintained in a proper sanitary condition. The periodical cleansing of these premises, as required by statute, has generally been carried out. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops At the beginning of the year there were 7 dairies in the district registered under the Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959. One dairy closed during the year. All premises were inspected from time to time. The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960, came into operation on 1st January, 1961, in so far as they relate to dealers' licences and provide, inter alia, that dealers' licences will be granted by the food and drugs authority and the period for which these licences will be granted is extended from one year to five years. Dealers' licences now permit sales outside as well as inside the area of the licensing authority and supplementary licences are discontinued. Ice Cream Premises The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1959, control the method by which ice cream should be manufactured. Most of the ice cream sold is manufactured outside the Borough. There were 155 premises registered for the sale of ice cream. Fish Friers At the end of 1962 there were eight premises in the district where the business of fish frying is carried out. Game Licences Fourteen applications were received under Section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1894, from tradesmen in the Borough for licences to deal in game. A licence was granted in each instance. Display of Dog Notices in Food Shops Notices for exhibition have been supplied to all food shops in the district, pointing out that the presence of dogs is a danger to the health of the public. School Kitchens A number of visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to school kitchens and the staffs are to be commended on the high standard of cleanliness which has been maintained. 60 Hawkers There were 23 hawkers registered under the requirements of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944, of which 6 were barrow boys operating in the district. SLAUGHTERHOUSES ACT, 1958 SLAUGHTER OF ANIMALS ACT, 1958 Report on Slaughterhouse Facilities There is one private slaughterhouse operating in the district from which the owner obtains part of his supplies of home-killed meat for sale in his own shops in Finchley and adjoining districts, including Hornsey, Hendon, Barnet and Friern Barnet. In addition this facility is used by local pig keepers who need occasional and seasonal accommodation. During the year no animals were slaughtered. Humane Slaughter of Animals In accordance with the provisions of the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1958, any animals slaughtered in a slaughterhouse within the district must be stunned by means of a mechanically operated instrument kept in good repair. This method of slaughter continues to prove satisfactory. Licensed Slaughtermen The Act also provides that no animal shall be slaughtered or stunned by any person who is not the holder of a licence granted by the local authority. The licences granted by the Council have to be renewed annually. Two persons were licensed during 1962. Unsound Food Condemned (1) In Slaughterhouses NIL (2) In Shops Cattle Beef 222 lbs.

Food Sampling I give below information supplied to me by the Chief Officer of the Public Control Department, Middlesex County Council, concerning the activities of his department in Finchley during 1962:— Food and Drugs Act, 1955: Samples Procured during the year Articles Total Samples Procured Unsatisfactory Milk, raw 40 — Milk, various 2 — Butter and Margarine 12 — Flour Confectionery 9 — Cheese and cheese products 11 — Cream 10 — Drugs 8 — Fish and fish products 8 — Fruit, fresh 17 2 Fruit, canned 6 — Meat and meat products 57 — Sauces 4 — Sausages 7 — Soft Drinks 6 — Vinegar 5 — Miscellaneous 15 2 217 4 The foregoing table shows the types and numbers of samples procured in the Borough from which it will be seen that of the total of 217 samples procured 4 were found to be unsatisfactory. Two of these were of fresh fruit. Both samples were labelled and sold as Granny Smith apples whereas, in fact, one sample was of Italian Lavine apples and the other Italian Rennette Walder apples. The greengrocer concerned was prosecuted and fines totalling £10 were imposed, together with five guineas toward the costs. One of the two unsatisfactory miscellaneous samples was of runner beans which had been supplied to a school in the Borough for consumption in meals provided by the School Meals Service. The beans supplied were soft and stringy and 50% of the weight supplied was waste. In view of the fact that this was the first 63 offence of this nature committed by the contractor concerned the County Council sent him an official caution. The other sample not satisfactory was of frozen peas which were found on examination to contain a small ball of clay. The clay appeared to have been overlooked in the cleaning and screening process to which the peas were subjected before being placed in the packet, and since the firm supplying has an excellent record, a letter of warning was sent to them. In addition to samples purchased, a total of 423 labelled stacks and displays of fish, meat, apples, and various types of citrus fruit and soft fruit, were examined in the shops. Formal samples are selectively procured from retail shops based on these examinations of labelled displays of natural foods, where there is doubt as to the accuracy of the label or where there is need for further examination. The Inspectors of the Public Control Department have over a number of years acquired a considerable expertise in the identification of cuts of meat and of varieties of fish and fruit. New Regulations dealing with emulsifiers and stabilisers in food, and new Regulations dealing with preservatives in food were introduced in 1962, together with an amended Food Standard relating to table jellies. The effect of the Regulations dealing with emulsifiers and stabilisers and with preservatives is to define and limit the additives which are permitted and (in the case of preservatives), to extend the range of foods and the types of preservatives which are allowed, but nevertheless closely limiting the quantities of such preservatives. No infringement arising from the new Regulations was reported during the year. Merchandise Marks Act, 1887-1953: Inspections are carried out under the above Acts to ensure that the requirements of the various Marking Orders relating to the indication of origin of imported foodstuffs are applied. Inspections were made at 143 premises, and a total of 645 displays were examined. Only minor breaches of the Orders were disclosed and were dealt with by warnings. Under the provisions of the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887, it is an offence to apply a false trade description to goods. For displaying, marked "Danish," bacon from Northern Ireland a Finchley grocer was given a conditional discharge on payment of five guineas towards the costs. For describing as "English" bacon from Poland another grocer was sent an official caution. Safe Milk: Fifty samples of raw milk were procured in the Borough and tested for the presence of tubercle bacilli. All were satisfactory. Thirty-one samples of pasteurised or sterilised milk were procured from retailers and tested to ascertain whether or not pasteurisation or sterilisation had been correctly performed. No failure was reported. Nine inspections of premises at which milk is pasteurised were carried out during the year to ensure that the dairies concerned conformed to the requirements of the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960. 64 Labelling of Food Order, 1953: This Order requires prepacked food to be marked with the name and address of the packer or labeller, or to bear a registered trade mark; to be marked with its common or usual name or its appropriate designation; and to bear a statement of ingredients if the food consists of more than one ingredient. It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed. A total of 144 premises were visited in connection with the Order, and 613 items of food were examined. One infringement was disclosed. This was a packet of ice-cream powder found on sale in a retail shop, and which was of imported origin, bearing no statements in English at all. The importer was sent a letter of warning, and the product was withdrawn for proper labelling. Labelling and Advertising Infringements: A considerable amount of work was done in the year which, while it did not arise from samples and inspections in the Borough of Finchley, nevertheless has the effect of protecting the residents of each county district. The matters mentioned below were of nationally retailed articles of food, which are widely distributed throughout the county. Several manufacturers and importers were reminded of the obligation to put on the label of foods the name and address of the packer or labeller. Similar action was taken in respect of pickles, canned peas and mixed vegetables which did not bear a statement of ingredients. One manufacturer of ice-cream was found to be putting all the statutory declarations on the base of the carton. He was reminded that these declarations are required to be both conspicuous and prominent. Two advertisements for honey did not disclose that the honeys offered were of foreign origin. The Mechandise Marks Act requires this, and letters were sent to the advertisers reminding them of their obligation to declare the origin in advertisements. Some prepacked lamb chops found to be generally on sale were of imported origin. The declaration in such a case is required to be in half-inch letters; the lettering used was so small as to be quite inconspicuous, and the packers were required to comply with the prescribed conditions. Matters dealt with under the Food and Drugs Act by correspondence, included a sample of cream cheese containing less milk fat than was considered sufficient to justify the title. Five examples of cake mixes, which were not complete mixes in that other additions such as egg or milk, were necessary before the mix could be used, were found. The manufacturers were required prominently to show what additions were necessary. The manufacturers of four brands of milk pudding which was described on the label as "Creamed Rice" were challenged on the ground that the product was, in fact, a rice milk pudding and not creamed rice. Correction to the labels was secured. The manufacturer of a lemon juice was challenged that a claim on the label for slimming properties for the juice was not justified, and he amended his labels to delete the claim. 65 A sample of cream was procured which was labelled "thick cream." The fat content of this cream was less than the standard prescribed for thick cream and the product was re-labelled "Sterilised Cream." A manufacturer of a canned meat product claimed on the label that it was "Full of lean red meat." The meat-content was no more than is normal for this class of product, and the manufacturer was therefore challenged as to the accuracy of the claim. It was withdrawn. The manufacturers of several breakfast cereals were challenged on the ground that the labels claimed the foods to be "Vitamin Enriched." The vitamins present did not provide one-half of the daily requirement which, it is considered, is the minimum to support a claim to enrichment. The labels were amended to "Vitamin Fortified" which, because vitamins were added, is true. A sample of iced lollies for which it was claimed that glucose was present, was found on analysis not to be correct. The lollies originally had been made with added glucose, but glucose had been dropped from the recipe, but the label was not amended. Reference to glucose was deleted. It was claimed for a sample of chopped pork that it contained "more meat." The percentage of meat was no greater than that of comparable products and the manufacturer was required to delete the claim. A sample of butter mintoes was labelled "Made with Butter." This was not true; other fats were present as well; the label was amended to "contains butter." A sample of sodium fluoride tablets was found on analysis to be deficient of the stated amount of the chemical. Because, in spite of the deficiency in the chemical, it was considered that the efficacy of the tablets was not impaired, the manufacturer was sent a letter of caution. Two samples of instant coffee were found to contain sulphur dioxide, a preservative not at the time permitted in instant coffee. The manufacturers and importers concerned were sent letters of caution. A sample of dried apricots was found to contain sulphur dioxide. A quantity of preservative would have been satisfactory if its presence had been declared. The manufacturers were required suitably to amend the label, and, together with the importers concerned, were sent letters of caution. Legal Proceedings A dairy firm was prosecuted by Finchley Borough Council under Section 2 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, for selling a bottle of milk not of the standard demanded in that it contained "mould hyphae and spores and general dirt occluded in congealed milk." The firm admitted the offence and was fined £75 with £13 15s. Od. costs. 66 SHOPS ACT, 1950 Inspection of shops in the Borough has been carried out and complaints and contraventions dealt with. Particulars in regard to shops on the Register are as follows:— Number on Register at beginning of 1962 931 Number closed 18 New shops 13 Number on Register at end of 1962 926 Changes of Occupancy 15 The number of persons observing the Jewish Sabbath and registered in accordance with the provisions of Section 53 of the Act was thirteen. CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 1961 HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) REGULATIONS, 1953 The Consumer Protection Act, 1961, which came into operation on 19th August, 1961, repealed the Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952. The Regulations of 1953, however, remain in force and inspections were made of new fires on sale at premises within the Borough. There were no contraventions of the requirements of the Regulations. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 Two traders whose premises come within the definition of the Act are registered. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 The number of persons licensed at the end of the year was 6. All premises have been inspected. LAND CHARGES ACT, 1925 Outstanding Notices One thousand, eight hundred and forty-three memoranda were received during the year from the Town Clerk enquiring whether or not there were any outstanding notices with respect to certain properties in the district. The necessary searches were made and the required information furnished. 67 GENERAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE STATUTORY AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES AVAILABLE IN THE BOROUGH STATUTORY SERVICES PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES Health Services under Part III of the National Health Service Act, 1946, are provided by the Middlesex County Council.

MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES The Borough of Finchley forms part of the EAST CENTRAL DIVISION for Mental Health Services in the Middlesex County Council. Divisional Office: 2, Maryland Road, Wood Green, N.22. (Tel.: BOWes Park 4281). Senior Medical Officer: Dr. R. C. Greenberg. Divisional Mental Welfare Officer: Mr. W. J. Ward. Mental Welfare Officers: Mr. E. Inglis; Miss M. Lay; Mr. C. Carr; Miss J. E. Maclean; Miss T. Kristensen; Mr. R. Harmer. Mental Health Social Worker: Miss C. M. Coups. Psychiatric Social Worker: Miss E. Arkinstall. The mental health social worker makes regular visits to the homes of all the sub-normal and severely sub-normal females and males up to the age of ten years and advises on all aspects of the patient's well being and employment in appropriate cases. She submits written reports on her visits so that where necessary the County Medical 70 Officer may take appropriate action such as arranging admission to psychiatric hospitals either on a temporary or permanent basis. Such temporary admissions, of up to eight weeks, are arranged to meet acute domestic difficulties or ill health of mother. The mental welfare officers deal similarly with the sub-normal and severely sub-normal males over the age of ten years. The main duty of the mental welfare officer is pre- and after-care of those persons suffering from mental illness including dealing with those requiring compulsory detention in psychiatric hospitals under the Mental Health Act, 1959. Both the mental welfare officers and the mental health social workers transport patients in their cars to and from the psychiatric hospitals, in case of emergency. The psychiatric social workers are largely concerned with the after-care and rehabilitation of persons discharged after undergoing treatment either in hospitals or at out-patient clinics but also deal with a similar type of case who may not have had to enter a psychiatric hospital and in cases referred from the National Assistance Board because of chronic unemployment, they also assist couples in cases of mental difficulty. As regards the general practitioners, they receive via the Middlesex Executive Council, a schedule setting out the information given above and also the procedure under which they may obtain the services of a mental welfare officer outside normal office hours. In addition to the home visiting service, there are junior training schools for the young severely sub-normal and adult training centres for those of sixteen years of age and over. Although at present there are none of these establishments actually sited within the Borough, Finchley children are transported daily by coach to the purpose-built Friern Barnet Junior Training School and Finchley youths and girls are taken by coach to the Edmonton Adult Training Centre. A therapeutic social club is run with the help of Miss Arkinstall, Psychiatric Social Worker, for incipient mental cases and for those discharged from psychiatric hospitals who are in need of after-care, at York Park Day Nursery, York Road, Hendon, N.W.9, at 7 p.m. every Tuesday evening. It is the County Council's intention to increase the above facilities and to provide, in addition, hostel accommodation for the mentally disordered living in the community. WELFARE SERVICES Welfare Services under Part III of the National Assistance Act, 1948, are provided by the Welfare Department of the Middlesex County Council.
