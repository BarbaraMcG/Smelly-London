Tel: BRIxton 7755 July, 1964 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Lambeth Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen. I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year 1963 on the health of the Borough of Lambeth. The birth rate of 22.01 was the highest since the post war peak year of 1947. Of live births 17.4% were illegitimate compared with 17.3% in 1962. This high Percentage was commented on in my report last year. I regret to report that the infantile mortality rate is the highest for 10 years, although the figures for the years 1957, 1958 and 1959 are very close to the Present figure. The reason for this rise is not readily apparent but the increase is more in proportion in the illegitimate births than the legitimate although both are affected. Apart from 2129 cases of measles the year was free from outbreaks of infectious diseases. Three cases of typhoid fever occurred during the year, one of which was certainly, and the other two probably, contracted abroad. Because of this travellers abroad should consider the advisability of being immunised against this disease. During the year the Council gave serious consideration to the implementation of the provisions of those sections of the Housing Act 1961 dealing with "Houses in Multiple Occupation" but in view of the shortage of staff it was not possible to deal with more than a few cases. Towards the end of the year the appointment of two technical assistants to carry out surveys with a view to action under the Act was authorised and these officers were appointed early in 1964 and action is being taken. By the end of the year 11 Smoke Control Areas had been declared by the Council and of these 8 were operative. The work amongst the elderly continues to expand. During the year another visitor was appointed to work in the department and it is probably due to the efforts of these two officers that it was not necessary to remove any old person compulsorily from their homes. In addition the work of the Lambeth Old People's Welfare Association has grown as can be seen from the Association's Annual Report which is included in the body of this report. 10 There were three retirements from the Public Health Inspectorate during the year, Mr. H. Bryan, Mr. E. Morgan and Mr. S. Heal. Each of these officers had been with the Council many years and their valuable experience of the borough will be greatly missed. To offset this three public health inspectors were appointed and one of the students qualified. At the end of the year there were three vacancies. In conclusion I am pleased to acknowledge the support given to me by Members of the Council and the Public Health Committee in particular. My thanks are due also to the other Chief Officers for their co-operation during the year and to members of the staff of the Public Health Department for their loyal and conscientious service. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, F. SUMMERS Medical Officer of Health 11 SECTION A STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Lambeth is one of the largest Metropolitan Boroughs, both in population and area. It has common boundaries with Battersea, Wandsworth, Croydon, Penge, Camberwell, Southwark and the Cities of London and Westminster. The total area of the Borough is approximately 61/2 square miles. This area excludes tidal water and foreshore, but includes approximately five acres which have been added to the Borough as a result of the new South Bank embankment, part of the river area having been reclaimed. The land surface rises from 12 feet above sea-level at the river to 50 feet at Brixton, 150 feet at West Norwood and about 379 feet at and near the Crystal Palace. The perimeter of the Borough measures 17/4 miles. The Borough has approximately 328 acres of open space, including Brockwell, Kennington, Ruskin, Norwood, Archbishop's and Vauxhall Parks and Myatt's Fields. Among the world famous buildings within the boundaries are Lambeth Palace, the Oval cricket ground, the County Hall, the Royal Festival Hall and the Headquarters of the London Fire Brigade. Lambeth is divided into three Parliamentary Divisions, Vauxhall, Brixton and Norwood, each returning one member of Parliament and three members to the London County Council. These Divisions are, in turn, divided into a total of 21 wards for the purpose of Borough Council elections. 12 STATISTICS GENERAL Area of Borough 4,087.5 acres No. of Wards 21 No. of Parliamentary Constituencies 3 Population Figure supplied by Registrar General (Mid-year estimate 1963) 223,120 Population figure Census 1961 223,763 Density of Population i.e. number of Persons per acre (Based on Registrar-General's Estimated Population) 54.6 Number of marriages during year 2,098 Marriage rate per 1,000 Population 9.4 Marriage rate per 1,000 Population England and Wales 14.9 Rateable Value of District (1963/64) £12,887,700 Sum represented by Penny Rate (1963/64) £53,000 Number of separately rated houses and flats (1963/64) 57,077 BIRTHS Live Births Legitimate Illegitimate Totals Males 2,310 482 2,792 Females 2,291 497 2,788 Totals 4,601 979 5,580 Live Birth Rate per 1,000 Home Population 25.01 Birth Rate corrected for comparison with other areas 22.01 Comparability Factor supplied by Registrar General 0.88 13 Birth Rate per 1,000 Home Population County of London 20.1 Birth Rate per 1,000 Home Population England and Wales 18.2 Corresponding Rate for the Borough of Lambeth for the year 1962 21.94 Illegitimate Live Births per cent of total live births 17.4% STILL BIRTHS Legitimate Illegitimate Totals Wales 42 13 55 Females 28 5 33 Totals 70 18 88 Still Birth Rate per 1,000 Total Births (i-e. live and still) 15.5 Still Birth Rate per 1,000 Home Population 0.39 Still Birth Rate per 1,000 Total Births England and Wales 17.2 DEATHS Males Females Total 1402 1330 2732 Death Rate per 1,000 Home Population 12.24 Death Rate corrected for comparison with other areas 13.71 Comparability Factor supplied by Registrar General 1.12 Death Rate per 1,000 Home Population England and Wales 12.2 Corresponding Rate for the Borough of Lambeth for the year 1962 11.1 14 Death Rate per 1,000 Home Population County of London 12.4 MATERNAL MORTALITY Number of Women dying in consequence of childbirth 3 Maternal Mortality Rate per 1,000 Total Births 0.53 Maternal Mortality Rate per 1,000 Total Births County of London 0.52 INFANTILE MORTALITY Deaths of Infants under 1 year of age Legitimate Illegitimate Totals Males 63 14 77 Females 47 17 64 Totals 110 31 141 Death Rate of Infants under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births 25.27 Death Rate of Infants under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births County of London 21.4 Death Rate of Infants under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births, England and Wales 20.9 Legitimate Infantile Mortality rate 23.9 Illegitimate Infantile Mortality rate 31.6 Deaths of Infants under 4 weeks of age Legitimate Illegitimate Totals Males 32 7 39 Females 28 15 43 Totals 60 22 82 15 Neo-natal Mortality Rate (Deaths under four weeks per 1,000 live births) 14.7 Neo-natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births County of London 14.2 Neo-natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births England and Wales 14.2 Deaths of Infants under 1 week of age Legitimate Illegitimate Totals Males 30 6 36 F emales 25 14 39 Totals 55 20 75 Early Neo-natal Mortality Rate (Deaths under one week per 1,000 live births) 13.4 Perinatal Mortality Rate (Stillbirths and deaths under one week combined per 1,000 total live and still births) 28.7 Perinatal Mortality Rate England and Wales 29.3 16 BOROUGH OF LAMBETH SUMMARY OF VITAL STATISTICS FOR THE TEN YEAR PERIOD 1954 - 1963 Year Population Deaths *Death Rate Live Births *Live Birth Rate Deaths of Infants under 1 year of age Infantile Mortality Rate Maternal Deaths Maternal Mortality Rate 1954 226,200 2,298 10.26 3,684 14.33 86 23.34 6 1.59 1955 224,200 2,385 10.74 3,597 14.12 74 20.57 4 1.08 1956 223,900 2,389 11.10 3,915 15.74 83 21.20 1 .25 1957 224,300 2,359 10.83 4,205 16.82 98 23.90 NIL NIL 1958 223,600 2,529 11.65 4,444 17.12 111 24.98 1 .22 1959 223,300 2,483 11.38 4,685 19.09 116 24.76 1 .21 1960 224,080 2,388 10.86 4,802 19.55 101 21.0 2 .41 1961 221,960 2,585 11.65 4,847 19.87 109 22.41 3 .61 1962 223,370 2,479 11.10 5,329 21.94 102 19.15 5 .92 1963 223,120 2,732 13.71 5,580 22.01 141 25.27 3 .53 * As adjusted by Comparability Factor 17 BOROUGH OF LAMBETH CAUSES OF DEATH AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF LIFE DURING 1963 CAUSE OF DEATH Sex Total All ages Under 4 weeks 4 weeks and under 1 year AGE IN YEARS 1- 5- 15- 25- 35- 45- 55- 65- 75 and over 1.

The estimated home population of the Borough was 223,120 compared with 223,763 in 1962, a reduction of 634. As the number of live births exceeded the number of deaths by 2,848 giving a natural increase in population a movement of residents out of the Borough would appear to be indicated. biRths The number of live births increased by 251. This coupled with the reduction in the estimated home population gives an increased corrected birth rate of 22.01 compared with 21.94 in 1962. The crude birth rate was 25.01 per 1,000 home population compared with 23.85 last year. This increase however is not reflected in the corrected rate due to the fact that the comparibility figure supplied by the Registrar-General is less than that for the year 1962 and the crude rate has to be multiplied by this figure to obtain the corrected rate. The rate, however, is higher than either that for the County of London or England and Wales. Illegitimate births again increased, 979 occurring compared with 921 in 1962. still births The Still Birth Rate at 15.5 per 1,000 total births is less than that for England and Wales which is 17.2. deaths The total number of deaths was 2,732, 1,402 males and 1,330 females. This was an increase of 253 on the number occurring in 1962 and gives a corrected death rate of 13.71 compared with 11.1 last year. The rate is higher than those for England and Wales and the County of London which are 12.2 and 12.4 per 1,000 home population respectively. Male deaths exceeded female by 72. Heart and Associated diseases accounted for the largest number of deaths. Deaths from all forms of malignant neoplasms increased, 535 occurring compared with 473 in 1962. 21 Fatalities from respiratory tuberculosis were not as high as in 1962, 18 deaths occurring compared with 22. Deaths from other forms of the disease increased, however, from 2 in 1962 to 4 in 1963. Five more deaths occurred as a result of motor vehicle accidents compared with 1962, three more people died as a result of other accidents and six more committed suicide. infantile mortality The number of infants who died in the first year of life was 141. This is 39 more than in 1962 and gives an infantile mortality rate of 25.27 per 1,000 live births compared with 19.15 last year which was one of the lowest on record. The rate compares unfavourably with that for the County of London which is 21.4 and England and Wales which at 20.9 was the lowest ever recorded in the Country. Eighty two children died under the age of four weeks giving a neo-natal mortality rate of 14.7 compared with 13.3 in 1962. The early neo-natal mortality rate (deaths under 1 week per 1,000 live births) was 13.4 also an increase on last year's figure. According to the information supplied by the Registrar-General the deaths fell into the undermentioned categories.

DEaths from cancer of the lung and bronchus The number of deaths from this cause increased to 174. This is the highest number since figures first became available in 1950. 22 The deaths were split amongst the various age groups as follows. The figures in brackets are those for the year 1962.

The figures shown refer not only to Lambeth residents but also to persons living in other areas who were involved in accidents in the Borough. The number of fatalities shown in these tables may not agree, therefore, with those in the list of causes of death supplied by the Registrar-General. The Registrar-General's figures refer to Lambeth residents only, and the death may have occurred within the Borough of Lambeth or outside the district.

This was due almost entirely to an outbreak of measles, 2,129 cases being notified compared with 523 in 1962. Other diseases to show an increase were Scarlet Fever, 76 compared with 65; Whooping Cough, 164 compared with 64; Pneumonia, 48 compared with 35; Food Poisoning, 17 compared with 15; Scabies 25 compared with 17 and Erysipelas 5 compared with 3. Other notifiable diseases decreased. Poliomyelitis As in 1962 one case only, an adult female, was notified. This case was °f the non-paralytic type. Food Poisoning The seventeen cases of Food Poisoning were distributed throughout the year as follows First Quarter 1 Second Quarter 3 Third Quarter 5 Fourth Quarter 8 17 Salmonella Typhimurium was identified in 10 cases. In the remaining 7 cases the causative a gent was not identified. A small outbreak of food poisoning due to Salmonella Typhimurium occured amongst the nursing staff at a hospital in the Borough. There were only seven cases although the number at risk could have been as many as 500. The vehicle was thought to be cottage pie but unfortunately none was available for examination by the time the outbreak occurred. Salmonella Infections not Food-Borne In addition to the notified cases of food poisoning already mentioned the following salmonella infections were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department. 32 Salmonella Type Number of Outbreaks No. of cases involved in outbreaks No. of single cases Total No, of cases Family Other Blockley 1 1 Bovis Morbificans 1 1 Derby 1 1 Stanley 1 4 4 Tennessee 1 2 2 Typhi-Murium 2 2 TOTAL 1 1 6 5 11 Typhoid Fever Three cases of .typhoid fever were notified during the year. Of these, one definitely originated abroad and the other two were probably contracted outside the United Kingdom. No other associated cases were discovered either in the Borough or in known contacts elsewhere in the Country. The first case was a male aged 27 years who developed the disease on 29th June having spent a holiday in Majorca from 1st - 15th June with an organised holiday party. The second case was diagnosed in a local hospital in a New Zealand teacher who had been living in Europe and was resident in another London Borough. She was taken ill on 10th June having come to England on 16th May and spent some time in the West Country before coming to London just before the onset of her illness. It is possible therefore that she may have contracted the disease in this Country but investigations along these lines yielded negative results. There was some anxiety concerning this incident as a close contact of this case was a cookery teacher in a large school in the Borough She was immediately suspended from duty and no infection occurred either in this contact or the school. The third case was in a female aged 27 years who was taken ill some 25 days after returning from a holiday in Spain and was admitted to hospital as a possible case of typhoid fever. Tests in hospital proved negative until some three weeks after her admission to hospital, when the organism was finally isolated. There was a possibility that the disease was contracted in this Country but investigations were again negative. 33 borough of lambeth immunisation - 1963 Completed Cases Welfare Centres and Nurseries General Practitioners Totals Under 5 years 5- 14 years Under 5 years 5- 14 years Diphtheria Prophylaxis only 12 76 2 5 95 Combined Antigen Diphtheria and Whooping Cough - - 1 . 1 Triple Antigen Diphtheria, Whooping Cough and Tetanus 3,716 30 836 29 4,611 Diphtheria and Tetanus 70 81 - 1 152 Diphtheria - boosting doses - all ages 4,057 807 4,864 Whooping Cough only all ages (completed cases) - - - 34 Diphtheria immunisation is the responsibility of the London County Council, but may also be carried out by general practitioners and I am indebted to Dr. W.

INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATES OF VACCINATION International Certificates of vaccination for persons travelling to certain countries abroad are required in respect of Smallpox, Yellow Fever and Cholera. Vaccination against any disease other than yellow fever can be done by a person's own doctor, or exceptionally (by arrangement) at a hospital. So long as vaccination is done under the National Health Service, whether by a person's own doctor or at a hospital, no charge may be made for it, but in either case the doctor may charge for issuing an International Certificate. Yellow fever vaccination must, for international and technical reasons, be done only at a Centre designated by the Government, in London the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, 4,. St. Pancras Way, N.W.1., Medical Department, Unilever House, Blackfriars, E.C.4., and West London Designated Vaccinating Centre, 53, Great Cumberland Place, W.l. An International Certificate of vaccination against yellow fever will be supplied, after vaccination, at the Centre at which the vaccination is done. The International Certificates for smallpox and cholera (for completion by the person's own doctor) must be obtained by the traveller himself and taken to the doctor, it is NOT for the Doctor, or a Local Authority, or their Medical Officer of Health, to supply them. The forms can usually be obtained by the traveller from the Company arranging his transport, or he can get them from the Ministry of Health, Alexander Fleming House, Elephant and Castle, S.E.I. After completion by the vaccinator, certificates must be franked with approved stamp. Approved stamps have been prescribed for the United Kingdom. If the vaccinator is not himself an authorised user of a stamp, the person vaccinated must take or send the certificate for stamping to a local Authority. In England and Wales this is the Town Hall, Urban District Council of Rural District in whose area the vaccinator practices. It should be noted that this is not necessarily the area in which the person vaccinated lives. During the year 3,535 International Certificates of Vaccination were stamped by the Public Health Department. 35 TUBERCULOSIS Notification The following table shows the number of cases of tuberculosis notified for thefirst time during the year 1963 excluding transfers into the district andcases brought to notice other than by formal notification.

Table 1A following shows the number of cases first diagnosed as suffering from respiratory tuberculosis during 1963 and notified under the Tuberculosis Regulations. 40 TABLE 1A Respiratory Tuberculosis Non-Respiratory Tuberculosis Men Women Children Total Men Women Children Total Number of Cases diagnosed during the year 1963 30 15 1 46 2 1 - 3 Deaths 13 4 - 17 - - - - Deaths Out of a total of 17 deaths, 13 male and 4 female, 12 were directly due to tuberculosis, 10 of these male 2 female. They were all pulmonary cases and all were over 60 years of age, half of them were more than 70 years old. 4 were residents of the Hostel for Tuberculous Men. Of the female deaths 1 was aged 77 years and had been ill at home, neglected for sometime and was without early medical attention. The other was a patient with long standing disease, aged 65 years who had consistently declined or neglected her treatment. Of the Hostel deaths 2 occurred in patients with resistant organisms following as a result of inadequate co-operation in chemotherapy. Male deaths agpin reflected neglect of aged sufferers and 4 old men, 3 of whom were over 70 years old who had been ill for quite a long time were referred for advice and treatment when the disease was far too advanced for effective treatment. To a slight extent the death rate in the borough is inflated by deaths among residents at the Tuberculosis Hostel which receives patients from the Greater London area- Mespiratory Tuberculosis The decrease in incidence continued during the year and the lowest number ever, 46 were added to the Tuberculosis Register. The majority of these cases were at an early stage of the disease fully amenable to treatment. The decrease in the number of new cases occurred almost entirely among women and children 15 females and 1 child only being diagnosed during the year. Son - Respiratory Tuberculosis No case of bovine infection was recorded. 3 adult cases only were diag' nosed traceable to an initial primary lung infection. 41 Tuberculosis Incidence TABLE 2 Year Total on register New cases diagnosed Deaths 1951 1,541 266 62 1952 1,512 152 38 1953 1,434 115 39 1954 1,395 159 20 1955 1,281 86 12 1956 1,242 80 21 1957 1,252 128 7 1958 1,214 118 7 1959 1,240 86 8 1960 1,239 89 12 1961 1,159 77 23 1962 1,144 60 18 1963 * 1,411 46 17 * includes observation Table 2 compares Chest Clinic figures since 1951 and demonstrates the continued fall in incidence and death rate. No significant racial preponderance was suggested in the incidence pattern but it is worthy of record that out of 64 new cases, 7 were of direct Eirean descent. It is to be noted that the total number of cases on the Register has apparently increased following the Ministry instruction to include observation cases in the total for statistical purposes. Treatment Chemotherapy is now an established form of treatment for tuberculosis and is successful in the majority of cases. Initial treatment is given in hospital and a ward for male cases is available in Dulwich Hospital. Female patients may be admitted to Grove Park Hospital or the Lenham Chest Hospital. Subsequently long term chemotherapy is given as out-patients attending the Chest Clinic for a period up to 2 years. An average of 90 such patients were under treatment during the year. B. C. G. Vaccination This procedure is now reserved at Chest Clinics for contacts at special risk, for new born contacts and for hospital staff. 240 such vaccinations were Performed during the year. 42 Kealtii Visiting The London County Council continued to provide 2 full time Tuberculosis Health Visitors based on the Chest Clinic at St. Francis' Hospital to cover health visiting duties in the South Lambeth area. A total of 3,880 visits were made to patient's homes during theyear. welfare Close liasion was maintained with the National Insurance and National Assistance Officers who are now able to meet the needs of most patients. Where necessary, however, extra nourishment was provided by the London County Council on the Chest Physician's recommendation and 46 patients were supplied with milk butter and eggs during the year. In other neccesitous cases and in those with special needs help may be provided by the Chest Clinic Samaritan Fund supported by the Mayor of Lambeth under the Chairmanship of the Consultant Chest Physician. The day to day administration of the fund is the responsibility of the Chest Physician's Secretary who is also Secreta ry to the Samaritan Fund Committee and who was responsible for so assisting 150 patients during the year. 43 SECTION C GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA Ca r e of the Aged The appointment of the additional Visitor approved by the Council in 1962 was made in March 1963. The work continued to expand and the number of visits made by the two visitors increased by 317. During the year 584 new cases were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department, an increase of 31 over the number of new cases for 1962. The age groups into which these new cases were divided were as follows:- Male Female Totals 60-69 years 35 72 107 70-74 years 32 67 99 75-79 years 43 79 122 80-84 years 35 108 143 85-89 years 28 63 91 90-94 years 8 11 19 95 years and over - 3 3 181 403 584 The total number of visits made during the year was 3,817. The number of old people persuaded to enter hospitals and institutions voluntarily was 245. It was not found necessary to use powers under the National Assistance Act 1948 or the National Assistance (Amendment) Act 1951. The fact that compulsory powers of removal were not used is due to the good work done by the two lady visitors and credit is due to them. In addition a total of 540 persons received help in some form or another, and in 2 instances help wa s refused. The number of cases on the register, including those from previous years is 2,563. 44 Laundry Service for Aged Incontinent The arrangements made with Southwark Borough Council for carrying out this service continued during the year. The total number of persons receiving benefit from the scheme during the year was 161 (146). The total visits made were 3,087 (2,758) and the total number of soiled articles collected and taken to Southwark Cleansing Station was 37,516 (28,412). The total weight of the laundry cleansed was 28,092 lbs (24,953 lbs). The figures given in brackets are those for the year 1962. Home Bathing Service An increasing number of aged persons are benefiting from this service and during the year 2,728 baths were given. This is an increase of 328 over the figure for 1962. Old Peopie's Kolidays, 1963. During four successive weeks in May and two weeks in September, 1963 parties of old folk were taken to Brighton by coach for a week's holiday under the Council's holiday scheme. Some of these parties were seen off by His Worship The Mayor, the Mayoress and Chairman of the Public Health Committee. Letters of appreciation received and verbal expressions of thanks on their return from holiday and at the reunion held in December confirm that the old folk had a very enjoyable holiday. An extra coach outing for all parties was arranged by Rutland Tours Ltd., in addition to the outing and theatre trip officially arranged, and this, of course, added to the enjoyment of the old folk. The tables set out below show the age groups, and parliamentary divisions of participants in the Spring and Autumn holidays.

It should be noted that the Association's year covers the period from 1st April 1963 to 31st March 1964 and therefore does not co-incide strictly with the period covered by my Annual Report. REPORT During the year, many changes have taken place in the Association. First and foremost was the resignation of Miss Roith, who had been Secretary to the Association since 2nd January, 1961 and it was with regret that the Committee accepted the termination of her services on the 13th September, 1963. Miss Doris M. Beer, who had been Secretary to the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee for six years was appointed in September and took up her duties on the 4th November. The expansion of services which was the main concern of the new Executive Committee at its first meeting in July, 1962, has now taken place. The Deputy Organising Secretary who is a trained and experienced Social Worker, commenced her duties on the 1st April, 1963 and one of her tasks is the oversight of all the case work done in the Borough. There are now six Welfare Visitors, one of whom is a man. The Borough has been divided into five districts, and each of the women Welfare Visitors is responsible for a district. It was felt by the Association that one of the Visitors should be a man as there are many instances when a man's help is needed, and for this reason, he was not given a particular district but is called in on any occasion to all parts of the Borough. General Welfare Work Much constructive and re-habilitative work among the aged of the Borough has been made possible with the introduction of the six Welfare Visitors. 10,874 new contacts have been made with old people already known to the Association, and 1,886 new people became known and most of these presented a problem of some sort. Many were of temporary nature, and after a little help and understanding, the old people settled down again with just an occasional friendly visit to ensure that everything was alright, but in many other cases a of time and hard work has been needed to straighten out a difficult situation Applications come from varied sources and all day long the telephone is ringing with calls for help. Some of the requests for assistance relate to decorating and the Association is very grateful for the really practical help given in this direction by the members of the Lambeth and Camberwell group of the International Voluntary Service. One one occasion, the Croydon group of the I.V.S. also assisted with decorating. In all these cases, the old people concerned have very much, appreciated, not only the help with the actual decorating, but the interest shown by the members of the I.V.S. 47 It is of the utmost importance that our Visitors should be well informed about all the services available to old people, and they have attended short courses arranged by the London Council of Social Service, in conjunction with the National Old People's Welfare Council. Friendly Visiting It is becoming more evident that, with the increase of visits made by our Welfare Visitors, there is a tremendous need for friendly visiting. Our Visitors task is to try to meet any needs of the old people; to solve their problems, to help them to enjoy the closing years of their lives, and in many cases, to rehabilitate them and to bring them back into the Community from which, through age, disability, or loneliness, they have withdrawn. Quite often this means visiting daily for some time to support the old person in his or her time of need, but when the problem is solved the Visitor is no longer able to spend so much time, as there are many more waiting for this specialised attention. This is the time for the friendly visitor to take over. Sometimes we are asked to visit someone, and when the Visitor arrives, she finds the old person is just lonely. One old lady said "I want someone to come to tea" - she was not asking for help, she wanted to give. But she was very lonely because no one came to tea. We all know how we enjoy the friend who "pops" in whenever she has a minute to spare, especially if she brings all the interesting items of local news, and how much more does this apply to someone whose life has become restricted through age. If everyone who reads this report would "adopt" an old person, this wou d make a tremendous contribution towards solving the problem of loneliness in old age. The old person adopted may never meet the family, but through photographs, and interesting chatter about its various members would come to feel a part of it and would no longer be isolated and shut away. Meals-on-Wheels In the past year 886,636 meals were taken to people in their own homes by the Meals-on-wheels service. 30,862 of these were delivered by the Women's Voluntary service in the southern part of the Borough. The remaining 55,774 were supplied by the Association's six vans in the northern section. The largest number of people served on any one day 416. Over the year L.O.P.W.A. has had a gradual rise in the demand for meals, but the startling increase experienced during the winter '62-'63 was not repeated. The milder weather could have meant less illness and enabled more old people to to manage for themselves. In these circumstances it was not necessary to Purchase a further vehicle during the year, so it was decided to exchange the oldest van for a new one. In such an essential service it is vital that transport is always available and vans must be kept in perfect running order. The Association realises that the meals staff gives more than a meal to their customers. Sometimes they are almost the only contact with the outside world and their daily call is eagerly awaited. Often odd jobs are undertaken by the drivers and escorts in their own time, such as haircutting and needlework. Visits during the long Bank Holidays have been made by some of the staff, and 48 these have been much appreciated. It has always been regretted that so little time can be spared with each person but with an average of forty meals per van, it is not possible to stay longer than is necessary. Thanks are due to all those who give so much to make the Meals-on-Wheels Service such a vital part of the Association's work. Lunch Clubs Prior to May, 1963 there were three centres in the Borough providing meals for the mobile elderly person at the same price as the person receiving Mealson-Wheels. They were King George VI Memorial Club for the Infirm, St. Thomas' Senior Club at Northcote House, and the Gothic Restaurant. It was felt that Lunch Clubs offered an opportunity, not only to provide a hot meal at a reasonable price, but they also gave pensioners the chance to make social contacts with others in similar circumstances, especially those who do not belong to Clubs. The Association decided to experiment with this scheme and on May 13th 1963, Springfield Hall, Wandsworth Road was opened as the first centre for this purpose. Meals were cooked on the premises, and up to March 31st this year, 11,063 meals were consumed. In addition, 19,548 meals were provided for the Meals-on-Wheels service. Chiropody Since this service was first introduced by the Association in 1949 when one session was held and seven old people treated, there has been a gradual overall increase in the service available to the elderly. It is comforting to know that, during the year ended 31st March, 1964 the needs of 2,580 old people were met. In all, 31 sessions per week were held at five clinics, three at a private surgery, and eight in the domiciliary service. A total of 14,213 treatments were given. There continues to be an ever increasing demand for chiropody treatment and, although the expansion forecast in the 1963 report has taken place, the waiting lists for both clinics and the domiciliary service continues to rise. It has been necessary, therefore, to ask the London County Council for an increased grant to finance the additional expansion required. If approved a considerable improvement in the existing service should be achieved, and it should be possible to open two new clinics in areas not already covered by this vital service. The Association would like to thank all the chiropodists who continue to give such valuable service in alleviating one of the main needs of the elderly and to thank all the receptionists who give their unfailing voluntary help to the chiropody service. 49 Boarding out Scheme The objects of a boarding out scheme are:- (a) To discover elderly persons who are in need of other accommodation, who would like to live in someone else's household but are not able to arrange this for themselves. (b) To find householders or families willing to offer a home to an oldperson; and (c) To match up the elderly people requiring accommodation and the hostesses offering homes so that each will suit the other as far as can reasonably be foreseen. This is a very real service, although by its very nature it will only serve a small proportion of old people in the Borough. It is limited by lack of accommodation and the suitability of the old people needing such accommodation. The success of this service can never be judged by numbers. All Organisations who have established a Boarding Out Scheme are agreed that it is important to begin in a small way and to build up the service gradually. It is work that needs infinite patience and care and the delicate matching up of elderly person and hostess cannot be hurried. The Boarding Out Officer has been appointed and commenced her duties on the 6th January. Arrangements were made for her to spend some time with the Lewisham Old People's Welfare Committee, who already have this scheme in operation, working with and learning from the Boarding Out Officer. We would like to acknowledge here our appreciation of the help given. Although our scheme, has only been operating since the end of February, already we have been instrumental in helping two old people to find happiness in more pleasant surroundings. Lambeth Centre for the Elderly This purpose built unit was opened in June 1962 and caters for the needs of the elderly living in close proximity to the Centre. It is a two storey building with the workrooms on the ground floor. The top floor is used mainly as a rest or recreation centre and both services are in operation at the same time. The ages of those attending range from 60-80 years. Of the present total 69, nine are physically handicapped, three could be classified as mentally handicapped, and eight are rehabilitation cases. There is, however, a sufficient flow of work to cater for all sorts of handicap and enthusiasms, thus providing a constant sourse of interest for all. A very successful Christmas celebration was held with everyone present, having an excellent Christmas dinner and tea and a food parcel. The Chairman Presided at the dinner and declared a week's paid holiday to the delight of all Present. 50 The Rest Room is very much appreciated by all those who use it. Some like to come to relax and read, others to play cards, some just to chat; there is always a welcome from the staff, and the things so dear to most people's hearts "a cup of tea". There are 70 on the register (60 women and 10 men) and an average attendance in the Rest Room of about 30. The Centre does provide a worthwhile service within the community and there is ample evidence that it has been instrumental in giving a number of old people a new interest in life. Clubs There are now 29 clubs, some meeting two or three times a week, others only once, but all play a vital part in the welfare of the old people. Activities are varied, handicrafts, entertainments, cards, outings, parties, and club holidays are all features enjoyed. Some Clubs have their own visiting committee and many friendships are made through meeting at the Club. During the year under review there was an increase in the number of applications received, and in all, 21 grants were made towards rent or its equivalent, purchase of equipment, and fees or expenses of entertainers at the clubs. The Entertainment Grant of up to £5. has helped Clubs to maintain an interest for their members, and it is hoped that no club has had to cut down on its activities owing to the lack of finance. The Association would like to pay tribute to the Club Leaders for their untiring efforts in bringing happiness to so many lonely old people, and for their wholehearted support in all the work being done for the aged in the Borough. The Inter-Club Competition and Exhibition of Work. This was held again in October and there were over 600 individual items of entry. The judging was carried out by Miss Cuthbertson, the Principal of the Stockwell and Waterloo Institute, together with her deputy, Mr. E.C. Thompson and Miss King. The cookery entries were judged by Mrs. Everard of the South Eastern Gas Board The very considerable care taken by all the Judges was very much appreciated and thanks are due to the Mayor and Mayoress who attended and distributed the prizes. The Competition Shield was again won by the Springfield Club. Christmas Concerts. Unfortunately, because of the weather, only a few old people attended the "Club Christmas Concert", but those who did so, enjoyed their afternoon's entertainment, and sincere thanks are due to Mr. Walker who compared the afternoon for us. On the 19th December an Evening Concert was given by the Chatsworth Choir and the Monotype Works Band. As it was a bitterly cold evening, there were only about 50 old people present but the evening was very much enjoyed and we wish to thank both the choir, the band and the conductor, Mr. M. Mitchell. 51 Inter-Borough Talent Contest. Seven clubs were represented among the twelve entries for the Lambeth heats held in March. The judging was carried out by the Mayor, assisted by Miss May Barry and Mr. Tom Lewis. Mrs. Dimmock of St. Anne's Club at Vauxhall was the successful competitor and the Association again hired a coach to take a party of old people to the main competition at St. Pancras Town Hall. All those who had entered the Lambeth heat as competitors, accompanied Mrs. Dimmock and the remaining seats in the coach were offered to members of the St. Anne's Club. King George VI Memorial Club (Camberwell and Lambeth) During the year ending 31st March, 1964, the total number of attendances was 11,765. The number of members during the year was 456 (an increase of 28 on 1962/1963) and 134 came off the Register for various reasons. The actual number of members at 31st March, 1964 was 322, and there were 190 referrals during the year. 157 people started during the year, but 105 are still Waiting to join, some of whom were on the 1962/1963 list. The youngest member is aged 63, and the oldest will be 102 on 3rd June. 63 members went away for holidays through schemes organised by the Borough Council, U.G.S. Settlement, Old People's Welfare Associations, London County Council etc. Outings included invitations to Women's Institutes and "Over 60" Clubs in the Country, tours around the Hopfields, and a trip to the seaside for each of the five Club days. Christmas parties were enjoyed by all members on their respective Club days, and the Management Committee is grateful to their many friends for their generous donations which contribute to the success of these functions. The Monday Club won the Handwork Competition and a sale of the many and various items was held. The high standard of services provided i.e. bathing, chiropody, hairdressing. Personal shopping, taking members to appointments at hospitals, dental surgeries and opticians, giving advice on many welfare problems etc., is being maintained. Half-Day Summer outings Once again, the Association arranged outings for older more infirm people not belonging to Clubs. There were three outings during the Summer, a total of 111 people participated and more than half of these were over, eighty years of age. Two groups of ten people were entertained by the Kennington Toc H at a private house in Chessington, the Association's Kenebus being lent to them on both occasions. The three outings were made possible by the generosity of the Hedgerley (Bucks), Sidlow Bridge nr. Reigate (Surrey) and I wade nr. Sitting- 52 bourne (Kent) Women's Institutes who provided tea and entertainment; and the Rotary Club of Brixton which paid for all three coaches. Again, every effort was made to offer these outings to people who lead restricted lives because of physical or mental infirmity and there is no doubt that they were greatly appreciated and of considerable value. The Association thanks the members of the Women's Institutes, the Rotary Club and Toc H, without whose co-operation and help this type of service would be impossible. Holidays 400 old people went on the Holiday organised by the Lambeth Borough Council through its Scheme and 7 old people were sent away under the Infirm Holiday Scheme. A total of 53 women savea with the Association for two weeks holiday with the Women's Holiday Fund and 12 also went away at Christmas Goad Neighbour and Sitter-in Service This, like that of the Boarding Out Service has only just started. A part-time Day Care Officer was appointed in January. For a month her duties were primarily to understand the functions of the service and for this reason she spent some time with Mrs. Paynton who pioneered this scheme in St. Pancras. We would like to express our appreciation of the help given by Mrs. Paynton in this direction. The functions of "Good Neighbours" vary considerably from case to case according to the type of infirmity, living conditions and other help available. In addition to seeing that the old people are safe, befriending them and ensuring that all is well, they shop, collect pensions, light and attend to fires, check gas, prepare a light meal, call a doctor or welfare worker, get prescriptions, help tidy or make beds, empty commodes, persuade the old people to wash, to change personal and household linens and arrange laundry. They give the old people the security of knowing that there will be one person constantly in and out on whom they can rely, and to whom they can confide their worries and who will be their main contact with the outside world. Thi s security can have a tremendous effect upon morale. The functions of "Sitters-In" are fairly clear cut They relieve the strain on relatives simply by staying in the house with the aged and infirm person while the relatives go out, free from worry. They provide companionship, may prepare light meals and undertake simple tasks concerned with the comfort and welfare of the old person. Old people liable to fall may need support when going to the lavatory and so on. Both "Sitters-In" and "Good Neighbours" appointed under the Day Care Service are paid. They are used only when there is no other adequate support, and when the regular and continued care necessary is beyond what anyone will or can be expected to undertake on a voluntary basis for any length of time. 53 The success of this service has already been proved by a number of old People living happily in their own homes who otherwise would have had to be admitted to a Welfare Home or into Hospital.

Windle Taylor, Director of Water Examination, Metropolitan Water Board.for the following report on the water supplied to the Borough. The supply to the Borough of Lambeth has been satisfactory both for quantity Quality during 1963. The source of water supply is mainly River Thames derived Water with a small admixture of water from Honor Oak well in the Summer months. There were no new sources of supply instituted by the Board in the Borough during the year, but new trunk mains were laid in Lambeth to the extent of 1,462 Yards. There were no changes in the general scheme of supply in the Borough but lengths of small service mains were laid to the extent of 673 yards. All new and repaired mains are chlorinated before being brought in or restored to service and samples of the water from them are tested bacteriologically to ensure that its Quality is up to that normally supplied. The number of samples taken during the year was as follows:- Chemical Examination Bacteriological Examination Honor Oak Well 1 59 Thames-derived South of River 156 1,873 157 1,932 The average results were as follows:- 58 Average Results of Chemical Examination Milligrammes per litre (unless otherwise stated) Description of the Sample No. of Samples Ammoniacal Nitrogen Albuminoid Nitrogen Nitrate Nitrogen Chlorides as Cl.

The water from two wells is used for drinking purposes, or for the preparation of food. Reports of the analyses of water from these wells are received regularly and have been satisfactory for the year under review. Sewers I am indebted to the Borough Engineer for supplying me with the following information with regard to sewers within the Borough. A sum of £27,000 was provided in the estimates for the reconstruction of defective sewer in Greet Street, Speenham Road, Knatchbull Road, Miles Street and Baylis Road. The local sewers which are nearly 150 miles in length are maintained by the Borough Council whilst the main sewers, into which the local sewers eventually discharge, are maintained by the London County Council. The routine cleansing and flushing of the local sewer is carried out by the Council's direct labour force.

Areas centering around Myatts Field, Herne Hill Library, Effra Parade, Knight's Hill Railway (Goods) Station, and Idmiston Road were included in the Programme. The total area to be covered by the Programme (including Areas already operative) is 1669.06 acres. Circular 69/63 dated 17th December, 1963 was received from the Ministry of Housing and Local government. This stated that due to the rapid technological advance in the Gas Industry, a shortage of solid smokeless fuel suitable for burning upon open fires necessitated a reassessment of policy in the establishment of future Smoke Control Areas. In particular, it foresaw a change over from open firegrates to openable stoves, gas fires, electrical night-storage heaters (but not appliances subject to "peak load" fluctuation) or fixed oil fired appliances. Measurement of Atmospheric Pollution In addition to the five pollution measuring Stations situated in strategic Points in the Borough, which are maintained daily, an automatic device, termed a Sequential Smoke Stain Recorder, is in occasional use in the Public Health Department offices (Blue Star House, Stockwell Road). This can be operated to give a continuously comparative indication of the pollution of the air by suspended smoke Particles at intervals of 1 hour, 3 hours, 8 hours or 24 hours as necessary. It is used, particularly, to provide an hour by hour record of pollution levels during the incidence of "smog". 76 The following figures show the number of visits and revisits made by the Smoke Inspectors and the Technical Assistants during the year. Visits Revisits Timed Observations 207 – Untimed Observations 516 – Other visits, private and industrial premises 10,912 3783 77 SECTION E INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD AND FOOD PREMISES There have been no significant changes in the pattern or disposition of food manufacturing, processing or sale since the last report. The previous trend towards self-service in retail shops continues to expand and with it an even greater demand for pre-packed articles of food. Self-service introduced by two firms of wholesale grocers and provision merchants is now well established. They cater mainly for the smaller class of retailer who collects his supplies, providing his own transport for the purpose. An additional ice-cream factory has moved to premises outside the district, With one exception ice-cream is made on the premises where it is sold. In the main, the type of ice-cream favoured by these smaller manufacturers is the "complete cold mix" and sterilised mix types which avoids many of the hazards associated with the full scale manufacture requiring heat treatment of the raw materials. The sale of ice-cream, mainly "soft" ice-cream, by itinerant vendors continued but on a diminished scale, probably because of the poor summer. The last surviving butcher selling meat from a stall in the street gave up business during the year. The following Regulations and Orders, relating to food, were made during the year Regulation or Order Operative date Soft Drinks Regulations, 1963 20th July, 1964 Ice Cream (Heat treatment, etc.) (Amendment) Regulations, 1963 18th June, 1 Bread and Flour Regulations, 1963 1st ^ePtem Meat Inspection Regulations, 1963 1st October, Merchandise Marks (Imported Goods) (Raw Cucumbers) Order, 1963 30th October, Milk (Special Designation) Regulations 1963 29th September, Liquid Ese (Pasteurisation) Regulations, j9^3 1st January, 1964 Food Premises During the year under review 1,861 inspections were made to food prem' in the Borough. These inspections and revisits were made up as follows:- 78  Inspections Revisits Food Factories 303 39 Bakehouses 52 - Butchers 553 - Fried Fish Shops 20 - Ice Cream Premises 93 • Milk Shops 189 - Public Houses 25 - Restaurants 191 5 Dairies 60 - Other 375 3 1,861 47 The approximate number of food premises by type of business in the area is as follows:– Grocery and provisions 363 Greengrocery and fruit 165 Fish shops, wet dry and fried 98 Bakers 94 Butchers 142 Restaurants 202 Confectioners 279 Food and Drugs Act 1955 - Section 16 The number of registered premises is as follows:– Manufacture and/or sale of ice cream 614 Manufacture of sausages and preparation of preserved etc. food 294 Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959 - Regulation 8 Number of registered distributors 284 Number of registered dairies 2 Milk (Special Designation) Regulations 1960 The following table shows the number of licences in force:– * Dealers' Licences (Pre-packed) Tuberculin Tested 161 Pasteurised 245 Sterilised 253 Dealers'(Pasteuriser's) Licence 2 Dealers' (Tuberculin Tested) Licence 2 * Licences issued are valid for a period of 5 years. 79 SAMPLING OF FOOD AND DRUGS Chemical Analysis Two hundred samples were procured formally, 118 of which were of milk, and 1,300 samples were procured informally.

Articles marked with an asterisk were suspected of having caused food poisoning, but in none of these cases was the food poisoning organism isolated. Ice cream and Ice Cream Mix 37 Soft Ice Cream 6 Chocolate Coated Ice Cream 1 * Corned Beef 1 Creamed Rice 2 Canned Hamburgers 8 * Frozen Cheese-Burgers 1 * Plaice Fillet 1 Canned Ham 6 In the course of the year two comparatively large ice-cream factories have transferred their operations to districts outside the Borough. This, together with the factory which closed down in 1962 has changed the pattern of sampling of ice-cream which is now confined mainly to the smaller shopkeeper and caterer and to mobile ice-cream Vendors. of the 44 samples of ice-cream examined and submitted to the Methylene Blue Test, 12 fell into grades 3 and 4 representing 27% of the total. This does not appear to compare favourably with previous years when the greater proPortion of samples was factory samples and to this extent the comparison is not relevant. Samples of milk were submitted to the Public Health Laboratory for examination under the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations as follows:- Methylene Blue Test 198 (4 were void, the atmospheric shade temperature being over 65° F.). Three failed to satisfy the prescribed test. Phosphatase Tests 198 One failed the prescribed test. A thorough investigation into the causes of the failures was carried out in each case. Time and temperature tests were carried out on the plant but did not show any defect. There have been no failures during the six months following 84 Labelling of Food Mainly because of the progressive increase in pre-packed foods, scrutiny of declarations on labels attached to such food has become a routine duty of the Public Analyst and the Food Inspectors. Two main methods of approach are employed. The labels on foods purchased informally for routine analysis are inspected first by the food inspectors in respect of the administrative requirements of the Labelling of Foods Order and later in the light of the Public Analyst's report. In addition food manufacturers, packers and labellers in the Borough are encouraged to submit their proposals for labelling their products before distribution. This reduces the incidence of adverse reports by other authorities. INSPECTION OF FOOD Inspection at Shops, Stores, Factories and Wharf Large quantities of food of all varieties were inspected and as a result the following food was surrendered as unfit for human consumption and unsound certificates were issued.

Advice was given where appropriate. Some of these foods were prepared outside the Borough, and a few overseas. In such cases the Medical Officer of Health of the district concerned, or where appropriate, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, was informed. In one case legal proceedings were instituted, the result being as follows :- 17. Easter Egg Contaminated by mice. The defendant pleaded guilty, a fine of £2.0.0. was imposed and the defendant ordered to pay £1.0.0. costs. Street Markets Markets are held in The Cut, Lower Marsh, Lambeth Walk and Wilcox Road in the Inner Wards, and in Popes Road, Electric Avenue and Brixton Station Road. All these are inspected regularly. Slaughter of Animals Act No application was made during the year for the issue of a licence under the provisions of this Act. 89 SECTION F GENERAL Public Swimming Baths I am indebted to the Scientific Adviser of the London County Council for the following report on the results of Bacteriological Examinations of the water from Kennington Park and Brockwell Park Swimming Baths. These samples were taken during the year 1963 and cover the summer and winter seasons. 1963 No. of samples Agar count 1 ml. 37 C. 48 hrs. Presumptive coli. without faecal Faecal coli. 0-10 11/100 Over 100 Brockwell Summer 10 6 3 1 Winter 6 2 2 1 1 Kennington Summer 12 10 2 Winter 4 2 2 The following comments apply to the incidence of coliform pollution at Brockwell Park :- Summer 1963 - The coliform pollution was found at times of heavy bathing loads, when free chlorine residuals although ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 p.p.m. did not prove adequate for immediate bactericidal action. To remedy these residuals were rapidly increased. Winter 1963 - During the winter season, chemical dosing is done by hand and the incidence of coliform pollution was due to low, chlorine residuals. This was, however speedily rectified. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT 1948 Section 50-Burials Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act 1943, the Lambeth Borough Council is required to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who has died or been found dead in its area if in such cases it appears to the Council that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have been or are being made. During the year 27 funerals were arranged involving 16 males and 11 females. 90 The amount paid to funeral contractors was £273. 6s. 0d. The sum of £113. 13s. 6d. was recovered by way of grants, insurance policies and money found. The actual cost to the Council was therefore £159. 12s. 6d. LAND CHARGES ACT 1925 During the year 3,319 enquiries were received and dealt with in respect of searches under the above mentioned Act. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT 1933 The number of persons entered or retained on the list under the Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933 (Section 21) Part II was 140.
