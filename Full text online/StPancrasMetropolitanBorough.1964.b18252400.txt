November, 1965 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the London Borough of Camden. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in submitting to you the final Annual Report on the health, vital statistics and sanitary circumstances of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras for the year 1964. In accordance with the request of the Minister of Health, the report is presented in the same general form as has been done for some years past. Most of the vital statistics contained herein do not call for particular comment, but some show interesting comparisons. Population The population of St. Pancras continued the steady downward trend. 1984 showed a total of 121,870 residents whilst the 1924 figure was 214,000. Tuberculosis Deaths from tuberculosis continued to fall. The 1964 total was 10 as against 271 in 1924. Of the deaths notified in 1964 none was under 25 years of age. New cases of tuberculosis also show a steady decrease, 111 cases being notified this year, compared with 345 in 1957. Measles It will be rioted that there were no measles deaths between 1952–1964. This compares with 134 deaths from the period 1929–1938 and 15 deaths between 1939–1951. Sanitary Circumstances The number of complaints received by the Department was 518 less than in the previous year and, although there was an increase of 102 in 1963, the general trend for some years has been for a decrease in this figure. There was a considerable increase in the number of inspections in rehabilitation areas, where progress was made to secure compliance with the Council's standard of amenities in houses in multiple occupation. Work in connection with house purchase on loan improvement grants and Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1957, continued on approximately the same scale as the previous year. During the year, the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963, came into operation and some considerable progress was made in the initial survey. Clean Air Act The volume of work involved in establishing the borough as a smoke controlled area proceeded throughout the year. The St. Pancras (No.6) Smoke Control Order which has been confirmed by the Minister means that approximately two–thirds of the borough is within a smoke control area. In conclusion may I acknowledge once again the close co–operation and help the Public Health Department received from the Medical Practitioners in the Borough and from all those officials, both of voluntary and national bodies, with whom at one time or other during the year we are in contact. I thank the members of the Council and particularly the Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee for their interest and encouragement in the work of the Public Health Department throughout the year. Lastly, I wish to record my sincere thanks to all the members of my own staff for their co–operation, interest in the work of the Department and the health and welfare of the people of the Borough. I beg to remain, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, SUSAN M. TRACY, Associate Medical Officer of Health METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ST.

This area now links up with the southernmost smoke control area which forms area No. 3. During the year the whole aspect of conversions to comply with Smoke Control Orders were reviewed by the Minister in the light of the anticipated decline of open fire fuels over the next five to ten years. Local authorities are now permitted to pay larger amounts to encourage the installation of solid fuel appliances that are capable of burning hard coke (the main solid smokeless fuel that will be in plentiful supply), gas fires and also electric off-peak storage heaters, direct acting electric fires have now been excluded from grant assistance by Ministry directive. With the coming of area No. 6 into operation, approximately two-thirds of the Borough is within a smoke control area. 39 INVESTIGATION OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION The following table gives the average for each month of 1964 of the daily readings of the concentrations of smoke and sulphur dioxide at a further two recording stations.
