To the Vestry of the Parish of St. Giles, Camberwell. Gentlemen, The following is the statement of Works, &c. projected and executed during the year ending March 25th, 1862, with the particulars of some of the most important matters which during the above period have received the consideration of the Vestry. GENERAL PURPOSES. HIGHWAYS. The ordinary repairs of the Roads under the control of the Vestry, in extent about thirty-two miles, as also the Public Footpaths, about seventy miles, have received the necessary attention, and as regards the former, I think this Parish may claim for its Road condition a satisfactory position, by comparison with the adjoining Parishes, or other parts of the Metropolis. 4 I had occasion in the last year's Report to refer to the extraordinary wear and tear upon our Roads in the vicinity of the Main Sewerage and Railway Works; the same cause and effect has also continued during the past year, and has had a sensible effect in keeping up the expenses of repairs in their vicinity. The Crystal Palace also with its many thousand visitors annually passing to and from the building, as well as the carriage of the merchandize (a necessary adjunct thereto) tends very materially to enhance the annual cost of the repairs to the Roads through Dulwich, &c., it now being requisite to expend almost as much labor and material upon many parts of them, as is found necessary even in the more leading thoroughfares and populated neighbourhoods. In addition to which, these Roads were in their first formation not prepared to receive such constant and heavy traffic; and I think it will in all probability, at no distant date, be my duty to recommend to the Vestry a change in the material used on these Roads to meet this increased traffic; but I delay doing it for this reason, that the first outlay will be considerable, and further, it may be prudent to await the development of the Railway traffic, which may probably re-divert some of this traffic from the Public Roads on to the Railways now in execution in this locality. FOOTWAYS.—NEW KIRBING. In the last Report it was announced that the Vestry had ordered a sum of £200 for each Ward, to be expended in this very desirable work. Up to this date about one half of the quantity so ordered has been laid, and I anticipate by the time this Report is published, the entire quantity, viz. about 20,000 feet will have been completed. I may further state, 5 in anticipation of the current year's expenditure, that the Vestry has again voted a similar amount to be expended, so that before the next Report is presented, there will have been laid upwards of 40,000 feet, or nearly eight miles of Kirbing in the public Streets of this Parish.—The expediency of such an expenditure is too apparent to require comment, and I believe the general approval of the Ratepayers will amply justify not only the past but future outlays for such works. ANCIENT FOOTPATHS The attention of the Vestry has of late been much engaged to the subject of maintaining these Footpaths for the free use of the public, as in more than one case the right has been infringed upon, and the powers of the Vestry disputed; in the present condition of this question, it may be considered but necessary that I should in this Report become the exponent of the determination of the Vestry to preserve intact in respect to these Ways all its rights and privileges appertaining thereto. NEW ROADS. The additional Roads taken under the supervision of the Vestry during the time comprehended in this Report are,— Hill Street, from Commercial Road to the Langdale Arms Public House, a length of 270 yards. Queen's Road, Peckham, from the last named point to the Upper Park Road, being a length of 300 „ 570 „ 6 A previous Report furnished you the reason why more Road Improvement as regards "Private (and neglected) Roads" had not taken place, viz. the necessity for Legal powers. It may be fairly anticipated that the Metropolitan Local Management Amendment Bill will, in its practical working, increase the number of dedicated Roads and decrease the number of those almost impassable ways or thoroughfares which have been such fruitful sources of complaint during the existence of this Vestry. The extension of Building operations now going on in this Parish, especially in the neighbourhood of Dulwich, is necessitating the laying out of many New Roads; but there beiug new regulations in regard to their first formation under a Bye-Law of the Metropolitan Board of Works, and being also placed by the before mentioned Amendment Bill under public control whenever the Vestry may deem it desirable; these future Roads will be prevented from becoming Nuisances to their respective neighbourhoods. SEWERS. The quantity of work executed under this department during the past financial period is as follows:— BRICK SEWERS. PIPE SEWERS. 4.0 barl. 3.9 x 2.6 3.0 x 2.0 18" bar. 18 in. 12 in. 9 & 6 in. 360.0 307.0 520.0 267.0 ft. 489.0 1755.9 854.0 Total 1454 feet. Total 3098 feet. 4552 feet, or 7-8th mile nearly. 7 The above is inclusive of 790 feet of open Sewer either arched over or abandoned. No. 42 New Gullies have been constructed and trapped. 34 Old Gullies trapped and repaired. HOUSE DRAINAGE. No. of Honses permanently Drained. No. of Houses temporarily Drained. 392 153 Total 545 Houses. MAIN DRAINAGE WORKS. As regards the above I have but to report the continued execution of the Southern High Level Sewers through the parish of Camberwell, and which works it may be anticipated will be completed by about the end of the year, but whether the Vestry will be permitted to communicate any of the present Local Sewers therewith, until the Southern Pumping Station at or near Erith is completed, is at the present moment uncertain, and (from information I gain from J. W. Bazalgette, Esq., Engineer to the Metropolitan Board of Works) is dependant upon the powers that Board may possess to give relief to the Upper Districts by means of a temporary overflow at Deptford Creek; failing this, none of the present High Level Drainage of this Parish can be diverted from its accustomed channel, nor any very increased amount of new High Level Sewerage works be entertained until the permanent outfall is obtained. 8 The Main Low Level Sewer, so much needed for the drainage of the lower parts of this Parish, is not yet in execution by the Metropolitan Board of Works, by reason of which it will be seen, that no very extensive Sewerage operations of a Local nature can be at present commenced; notwithstanding which, the Vestry is doing its work carefully and progressively, so that the whole net work of Sewers may harmoniously work together eventually. It is in contemplation during the current year to extend as far as the circumstances of the sewage arrangements and the rating levied for such purposes will admit, the Sewers works in such parts of the Parish as may most urgently demand attention, always keeping in view that (except in extreme cases) no amount is expended but for strictly permanent works.—Some works of this character are now in progress and others about to be contracted for, particulars of which will appear in the succeeding Report. The Sewers under the supervision of the Yestry being as below stated, viz.— Brick Sewers 15½ Miles Pipe „ 7 „ Open „ 7½ „ Total 30 Miles. are in a satisfactory condition; the necessary repairs and cleansing of which are periodically attended to by the Officers and workmen of the Vestry, as also to all other Drainage works and matters incidental to the sanitary condition of the Parish. 9 IMPROVEMENTS. One among the improvements now going on in this Parish may be classed the London, Dover and Chatham Railway, the works of which are fast progressing towards completion, and which it may be reasonably expected will have a most beneficial effect, in opening up the more rural parts of the Parish, causing much additional traffic through it, and producing a large extension of residences of a superior class to be erected, and consequently enhancing the rateable value of the Parish in those neighbourhoods. I may here mention that an an tempt was made early in the present Session of Parliament, to introduce a Bill for creating a new District, to be called "The Crystal Palace District," having for its object the severance from this Parish of a large portion of the most valuable property in the neighbourhood of the Crystal Palace; and as there appeared to be no valid reason for such an innovation upon the rights of this Parish, the Vestry determined upon giving a decided opposition to the Bill in question, and every effort was made to prove the utter inutility of the proposed measure, and I am happy to say, with such unmistakeable success, that within a very limited period the Bill was withdrawn. This locality, by reason of the Railway above referred to, as well as of another line, viz. the " Crystal Palace Direct Railway," which has received the Royal Assent; as also by the gradual development of the Dulwich College Governors' scheme for buildings about to be erected on their property, bids fair to become a valuable adjunct to this Parish; the plans, &c for the roads, sewerage and buildings, on which property have been lately laid before the Vestry for their approval. 10 Also another line of Railway, just approved by Parliament, and projected by the London and Brighton Railway Company, from Denmark Hill, through Peckham to the Old Kent Road, &c., Win afford additional means of transit and must ultimately prove beneficial to this Parish. DRINKING FOUNTAIN AT CAMBERWELL GREEN. This ornamental structure may, I think, claim a position as one of the Improvements of the Parish, its beautiful design and also its usefulness added to the benevolent intention of the donor (assisted by the Vestry) evidences, I may venture to say, a general desire that this Parish should be in no way in the rear of the many improvements which Local government is every day developing in the Metropolis. Additional Fountains in other parts of the Parish, as also those equally necessary structures, viz. public Urinals, are at this time engaging the Vestry's attention. LIGHTING. The number of Public Lamps in this Parish up to this period is as below stated:— No. Lighted by tbe South Metropolitan Gas Company 1190 Ditto Phoenix do 62 Ditto Crystal Palace do 6 Total 1258 Additional Lamps erected this year 33 Removals 34 11 Applications for Road Lighting have been made from the localities of Sydenham Common, Sydenham Rise, Crystal Palace Road, Sydenham, the Road from the Alleyn's Head to Paxton Hotel, Norwood, and Avenue Road, Gipsy Hill, &c., which have received the attention of the Lighting Committee and have since been ordered by the Vestry, it being considered necessary that these localities (now being converted to building purposes,) require the protection which efficient Lighting affords. These Lamps are now in the course of erection by the Crystal Palace Gas Company. I believe I have not omitted any matter necessary either for the use of the Vestry, or which you might have desired to have had reported upon for the general information of the Ratepayers. I beg therefore with all respect, and grateful for the confidence and kindness with which my efforts to perform the duties of the office I have the pleasure to hold under you, is so uniformly accorded to me, to subscribe myself Your faithful Servant, J. C. REYNOLDS, SURVEYOR. 1861-62. MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. ANNUAL REPORT BY J. S. Bristowe, M.D , Lond., Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, Physician to St. Thomas's Hospital. Gentlemen, The year 1861 presented, in a sanitary point of view, few features of peculiar interest. The mortality was greater than it had been in any former year of my tenure of office, with the single exception of 1858. But the increased number of deaths depended, as I shall presently shew, rather on growth of population, than on deterioration of health. No epidemic, serious either from its nature or its extent, has alarmed the public or the medical profession. During this year the census was taken; but owing to the enormous mass of material with which the Commissioners have had to deal, and the great labour of working out conclusions, the complete results have not yet been published. A few facts of primary importance however had already transpired, twelve months since, in sufficient time to be incorporated in my last Annual Report. A few further facts I have learnt from a perusal of some of the proof sheets of the census tables, to which the chief Clerk in the census office has been kind enough to give me access. As an accurate acquaintance with the numerical strength of a population constitutes the very 16 foundation of all sanitary calculations, I will in limine briefly enumerate those particulars relating to Camberwell of which I have thus become possessed. Statistics of Population, &c. (Table I.). In the ten years which terminated in May, 1861, 16,821 persons were added to the population of the parish of Camberwell; and the number of inhabitants, which in 1851 was estimated at 54,667, became consequently in 1861, 71,488. This is the largest increase that has been observed during any similar period in the present century (Table II.) In the first decenniad (that commencing in 1801, and ending in 1811) only 4250 persons were added, in the second 6567, in the third 10,355, in the fourth 11,637, and in the fifth, or the one immediately preceding the last, not more than 14,799. It is by the ratio of increase however (Table II.) that we must compare the growth of Camberwell with that of other districts. Now, although the increments during the six decennial periods of this century have been successively greater, the ratio of increase has gradually sunk. In the first period of ten years the rate of increase was 60 per cent., in the second 58 per cent., in the third also 58 per cent., in the fourth 41 per cent., in the fifth 37 per cent., and in the last 31 per cent. But while Camberwell increased during the last 10 years at the rate of 31 per cent., London, notwithstanding its enormous progress, notwithstanding that its population augmented by 441,753 persons, shewed in the same period an increase of only 18.7 per cent. Camberwell continues therefore to be one of the most vigorous of the many vigorous parishes of which the Metropolis is composed. But the rate of growth of the several sub-districts of the parish during the last ten years shewed great differences' (Table I.) Thus, Dulwich increased by 91 persons, or from 17 1632 to 1723; St. George's by 4484, or from 15,849 to 20,333; Camberwell by 3555, or from 17,742 to 21,297; and Peckham by 8691, or from 19,444 to 28,135; or, to exhibit their progress in a comparative form, the increase per cent. of Dulwich was 6, of Camberwell 20, of St. George's 28, and of Peckham 45. Dulwich therefore has been the most stationary sub-district, and Peckham by far the most progressive, and progressive, let me add, in a very remarkable degree; nevertheless, a seed of prosperity has been sown in Dulwich, which will doubtless have borne most important fruit ere another ten years has passed away. There are still, I am sorry to say, 8000 more ladies than gentlemen in the parish. The number of dwelling houses has multiplied, and on the whole proportionately with the growth of population (Table I.) The number of inhabited houses increased between 1851 and 1861, in Dulwich from 259 to 294, in St. George's from 2845 to 3412, in Camberwell from 2851 to 3444, and in Peckham from 3407 to 4948. In the whole parish 2686 houses were added, and the increase was from 9412 to 12,098. Let me add, that in 1851 there were 925 uninhabited houses, in 1861 only 670; or, to put the difference in this respect at the two epochs in a more striking form, in 1851, 89 houses out of every 1000 were unoccupied, while in 1861, 52 only out of every 1000 were thus circumstanced. The late census therefore yields results, which must in every way be gratifying to the patriotism of the inhabitants of the parish of Camberwell. As an appendix to the above statement, I may mention that in Dulwich there were 5.8 persons to every house, in Camberwell 6.2, in Peckham 5.7, and in St. George's 5.9; and that in Dulwich there were to every acre of land 1.2 persons, in Camberwell 15.9, in Peckham 26.3, and in St. George's 48.8. 18 In the parish generally, the proportion of inmates to houses was 5.9, of inhabitants to acres 16.5, Statistics of Mortality, &c.—In the course of the year 1861, 1419 persons died in this parish. This number as may be seen by reference to Table VII. is, with the exception of that for 1858, higher than the return for any one of the previous five years. But the rate of mortality, that is the per centage of deaths upon population, was, as an inspection of the same Table will shew, 1.98. This number is below the death-rate of both 1858 and 1859, and very little in excess of that of 1857 and 1860. The death-rate of London during the last year was 2.3. The general result may therefore be regarded as satisfactory. The year, contrasted with former years' was not an unhealthy one; and the comparison of the mortality of Camberwell, with that of London generally, maintains for Camberwell still that pre-eminence in healthiness which I have always had reason to assert for it. The mortality of the several sub-districts was as follows:— (Table III) In Dulwich 28 persons died, in St. George's 367, in Camberwell 486, and in Peckham 536. The deathrate was for the first named place 1.65, for the second 1.8, for the third 2.28, and for the last 1.91. It might be assumed from this, that while Dulwich was by far the healthiest locality, Camberwell proper was by far the most unhealthy. But here a fallacy creeps in. In the Camberwell sub-district are comprised both the workhouse and two lunatic asylums (Table IV.), in the former of which 77 deaths occurred, in the latter 78. Of these deaths some scarcely belong to this parish at all, and the others (the great majority) belong not to Camberwell alone, but in proportionate degrees to every district of the parish. If deaths from these institutions be omitted, then the number of deaths in Camberwell sinks from 486 to 331, and 19 the death-rate from 2.28 to 15.5; and this locality so far from being the uuhealthiest, would thus actually appear to be the healthiest of the sub-districts of the parish. But when we have to deal with comparatively small numbers, as we do when contrasting sub-districts with one another, we are likely to be led astray by all kinds of errors, against some of which it is almost impossible to guard. Hence I do not at all venture to draw the prima facie inference that Camberwell during 1861 was really more healthy than Dulwich, on many other grounds, in fact, I do not believe it was; but I am fairly justified in coming to the conclusion, that of the four sub-districts, Dulwich and Camberwell were the healthiest, St. George's and Peckham the least healthy. Some differences will as usual be observed in the number of persons dying in the different seasons of the year (Table V.); thus, in the first three months 387 persons died, in the second 349, in the third 336, and in the fourth 347. The differences however were slight. The mortality was greatest, as it generally is, in the first or most inclement quarter; and least in the third quarter, as again we generally find, unless the mortality has been unduly raised by the effects of autumnal epidemics. As regards causes of death, (Table III.) it will be seen that 99 deaths are registered in the tables under the head of "violence, privation, poison and premature birth;" 25 under that of 'fever;" 9 under that of " dysentery and acute diarrhoea (not of infants) and cholera;" 38 under that of "scarlet fever, diphtheria and cynanche maligna;" 2 under that of "small pox 8 under that of "erysipelas, pyaemia and puerperal fever;" 164 under that of "diarrhœa, bronchitis, and pneumonia of infants, under three years of age;" 102 under that of "measles, hooping cough, and croup;" 114 under that of "hydrocephalus and convulsions of infancy;" 198 under that 20 of "phthisis and other tubercular diseases and 660 under that of "other diseases, chiefly chronic." In reference to some of the diseases here enumerated, I may make as usual a few remarks. Several of the above headings are of a complex character, including for convenience and brevity more than one different kind of disease or incident, the separation of which on sanitary grounds is a matter of no real importance. This is especially the case with the first and last heads on the list. Any variation which may occur from year to year in these (notwithstanding that certain cases among them may present individual features of surpassing interest), is in no degree momentous; but it is somewhat remarkable that the number of deaths assigned annually to each has varied but little. Other of the headings relate to diseases, which, though doubtless in many cases amenable to hygienic and medical treatment, and by these and other means to some extent preventible, are essentially the result of inherited and of personal defects and habits with which the labours of sanitarians have only to deal indirectly and remotely. Phthisis and hydrocephalus are the diseases to which I more particularly refer. Here again the annual variation has been but slight. Other headings again have to do with maladies, some of which have been called zymotic, and all of which are produced or at least producible by infection, or by malaria, or by insanitary conditions of various kinds. With these diseases, and especially with their causes, it is our special province to deal. Some of them have been more carefully distinguished in Table VI, and to this I particularly invite your attention. Fever numbered 25 fatal cases. Of these 6 occurred in St. George's, 9 in Peckham, and 10 in Camberwell. Typhus was not in that year prevalent in London, and all or nearly all the cases therefore were typhoid or enteric, or that form of disease which results from cesspool or sewage poisoning. 21 Scarlet fever produced only 13 deaths Of these 3 took place in Camberwell, 4 in St. George's, and 6 in Peckham. From small pox only 2 fatal cases were recorded, both from St. George's. From measles 8 deaths resulted; of which 1 occurred in Camberwell, 1 in Peckham, and 6 in St. George's. Diphtheria was fatal in 25 instances; thrice in St. George's, 6 times in Camberwell, and 16 times in Peckham. Hooping cough destroyed 72 lives; 2 in Dulwich, 21 in Camberwell, 23 in St. George's, and 26 in Peckhatn. The affections just enumerated constitute more especially the class of Zymotic diseases; and it is gratifying to find that on the whole they have neither been severe nor very prevalent. Two only of them have increased in fatality since the year 1860; these are diphtheria and hooping cough. Diphtheria increased from 11 to 25, but even then cannot be regarded as having been severe. Hooping cough increased from 36 to 72, and is the only one of this class of affections that can be fairly said to have been epidemic. The others all diminished in mortality; fever from 26 to 25, scarlet fever from 34 to 13, measles from 40 to 8, and small pox from 5 to 2. Diseases of the bowels and lungs, which are so prevalent and fatal in young children, cut off as nearly as possible the same number in both years, 166 in 1860, 164 in 1861. Erysipelas and pyaemia proved fatal to 14 persons in 1860, to 8 only in the year which has just passed. The ages of those who died are classified as follows (Table III); 521 deaths occurred under 5 years of age, 49 between 5 and 10, 31 between 10 and 15, 25 between 15 and 20, 81 between 20 and 30, 105 between 30 and 40, 103 between 40 and 50, 112 between 50 and 60, 149 between 60 and 70, and 243 from 70 upwards. As usual the mortality of children under 5 years of age was very high; from that period up to 22 about 20, deaths were comparatively rare; thence onward the mortality gradually increased with each decennial period, and we find that the number of those, who perished after threescore years and ten had been attained, was little less than half the number of deaths in children under 5. The extremes of life are ever its periods of greatest danger. The deaths among young children were more numerous last year than usual. Of the total number of deaths, 683 occurred in males, 736 in females, a difference depending mainly on the disproportion, before adverted to, in the numbers of the two sexes. The births (Table VIII.) during the year 1861 amounted to 2391, of which 1180 were of boys and 1211 of girls. The births were 972 in excess of the deaths. 42 belonged to Dulwich, 668 to Camberwell, 709 to St. George's, and 972 to Peckham. It is satisfactory to know, as an evidence of prosperity, that the births have regularly increased from year to year, (Table IX.) and that they were in the last year more than 300 in excess of the births registered in 1857. On the whole, the material progress of Camberwell during the last six years, and the health which with some few drawbacks it has enjoyed and, as the figures above adduced demonstrate, continues to enjoy, may justly be accepted as a Subject of satisfaction and congratulation. Works done.—I proceed now to enumerate the Works done (Table X.) in the department with which I am specially connected, but cannot do so without testifying to the great zeal and efficiency of my subordinates, the Inspectors of Nuisances. During the twelve months, which expired on the 31st of March, 1862, 1953 houses were inspected. As the result partly of these inspections, or house to house visitations, and partly of information derived through complaints, 268 houses 23 have been whitewashed and cleansed, and 29 repaired; 42 yards have been paved and amended; 25 dust-bins have been provided; 105 houses have had water supplied to them for drinking purposes, and in 75 cases water has been laid on to closets; 427 cesspools have been emptied, 149 filled up and abolished, 102 water-closets have been provided, and 232 drains trapped or cleansed. In addition to the above, 1402 complaints of nuisances stand in the complaint book, due either to accumulations of ashes, refuse or dung, to pigs or other animals dirtily kept, or to unwholesome or offensive trades or manufactures. All these have been investigated, and in the great majority of cases more or less effectually remedied. Further, 44 slaughter houses were inspected and approved of by us, and were consequently allowed to obtain their licenses unopposed. All of them have been periodically whitewashed and purified, and those requiring amendment in paving or other respects, have had the necessary works executed. The various mews have during the summer months been periodically visited and cleansed. Many of the above works were executed after inspection without the need of formal notice. In 362 cases notices were served, and in 22 they had to be repeated In 13 instances summonses had to be taken out in order to enforce the requirements of the Vestry. On the 31st of March, 20 notices were still outstanding, the works ordered being either in progress or as yet not taken in hand. In accordance with the desire of the Vestry, I have monthly tested the quality of gas, supplied by the South Metropolitan Company, at their testing house in Hill Street. The illuminating quality throughout the year was always considerably above that required by Act of Parliament. The Act specifies that the light, emitted by the flame of a standard Argand 24 burner, should never be less than that yielded by twelve sperm candles of a certain pattern. I have moreover, as a proof of its comparative purity, always failed to detect the presence of either ammonia or sulphuretted hydroged when I have submitted it to the legal tests. I have continued also to analyze monthly the water of the Lambeth, Southwark and Vauxhall, and Kent Companies, (Table XI.) and have still (as I have from time to time informed you) found the quality satisfactory. I beg, Gentlemen, finally again to thank you for the continued kindness which I receive at your hands; and to subscribe myself respectfully, Your obedient Servant. J. S.

And we beg to Certify, that the Cash Balance on the 25th day of March last at the Bankers, was £1324 8s. Id.; and that there was also £4000 on the Deposit Account. We find the Auditors on several occasions have included in their Audit the estimated value of the Stock of Materials in hand and other matters, consequently the Balances placed to the credit of the several Rates, do not accurately represent the Cash Balances. And we recommend that in future Cash Balances only be placed to the credit or debit of each Rate. Dated this 27th day of September, 1862.
