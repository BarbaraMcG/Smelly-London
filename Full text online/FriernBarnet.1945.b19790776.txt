FRIERN BARNET URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. Public Health Dept. Town Hall. N.ll. August, 1946. TO THIS CHAIRMAN AND MABERS OF THE FRIERN BARNET URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. Mrs• McCarthy & Gentlemen, Herewith I present to You my Annual Report for the year 1945. The Report covers the period 1st. January 1945 to 31st. December 1945, and is drawn upon the lines indicated in Ministry of Health Circular 28/26 dated 11th. February 1946. The health of the district continued at a high level throughout the year. The Death Rate remained low at 9.4 per 1000 of the population, whilst the Birth Rate increased to 14.9 per 1000. There were no deaths in child-birth,nor any cases of Puerperal Pyrexia. The incidence of the common infectious diseases was satisfactory. The number of cases of Measles was a little higher than last year, 100 as compared with 76. There was little Whooping Cough, only 15 cases occurring during the year. Notifications of Scarlet Fever also were fewer, 23 as against 47 during 1944. Only two cases of Diphtheria occurred, both children under 5 years of age, neither of whom had been immunised. During the year 74 cases of Scabies were treated. At the end of May premises in Hemington Avenue which had been used as a clinic for the treatment of this disease were de-requisitioned, and arrangements were made with the Medical Officer of the Joint Isolation Hospital in Coppetts Road for the treatment of future cases as out-patients at the Hospital. This arrangement is working satisfactory. -1- Dr. Stephen, School Medical Officer and Maternity and Child Welfare Doctor, has continued with her work of immunising" children against Diphtheria, during the year there . were 651 attendances at the various sessions held. By the end of the year 1070 children between the age of 0 - 5 years and 1218 children between the age of 5 - 15 years, representing 60% and 40% respectively of the child population had been successfully immunised. . The usual tables of statistics are attached, and I express my thanks to ray fellow officers for their assistance throughout the year. I am, Mrs. McCarthy & Gentlemen Your obedient Servant, W.W. Millen. Medical Officer of Health. -2- PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF. Medical Officer of Health. W.W. Millen. M.B.,Ch.B. Chief Sanitary Inspector. Albert Harman. Additional Sanitary Inspector.
