ANNUAL PE PORT OF THE MF.DTOAL OFFIOKR OF HiiALTH FOR 1950 Public Health Department, 2, Shalston Villos, Surbiton. August, 1951. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Surbiton. Ladies end Gentlemen, I am presenting my 29th Annual Report for Surbiton. Owing to alterations submitted by the Ministry concerning the description of certain diseases there may be some difficulty for lay people in comparing the statistics for 1950 with previous years. As usual the Senior Sanitary Inspector's report is attached. Vital Statistics: The population as estimated by the Registrar General for 1950 is 61,230, an increase of 1120, and on this figure all the calculation of vital statistics is based. Live births: The total number of births (male and female) for 1950 was 836 with a rate of 13.65 as compared with 892 and 14-83 for 1949- The cause of the lower birth rate is probably due to economic reasons and to the want of suitable living accommodation. Deaths: The number of deaths recorded in 1950 was 605 with a death rate of 9.88 as compared with 574 and 9.54 for 1949. The natural increase was 231. Infant Mortality. The number of such deaths was 22 giving a rate per 1,000 live births of 26.31 as compared with 21 and 23.54 for 1949. This rate is the highest since 1945* The figures given in brackets denote the rate for the previous year. Housing; During the year 454 units of accommodation were provided. For sub-division please refer to page 4. This shows a great increase on the number of units of accommodation for 1950 and does help to relieve the congestion, although it is very significant that only 9& have been erected by Surbiton as against 118 in 1949, but there was3 jump from 49 to 228 by other local authorities. There is still a large proportion of young married coupleand others who require accommodation as shown from the number of complaints received and appeals for rehousing. Although there may be only a few isolated cases of overcrowding many people are living in an overcrowded and undesirable state from a health standpoint, and are forced to share rooms in a . house which was not intended for this purpose, namely insufficient W.C. bathroom and kitchen accommodation, and this almost inevitably leads to diasension. 3 I have repeatedly received letters from the Medical Officer of the Tuberculosis Clinic end Core Almoner on behalf of persons asking for better accommodation pointing out that they are T.B. sufferers and require extra room so that, thooe so ill, can have a'sepsrete bedroom which no doubt you will agree is the corrcct thing. The Housing Officer has done his best to try and arrange this. Generally speaking the health of the people in Surbiton is very satisfactory as shown by the vital statistics and therefore speaks well for the social welfare activities together with sanitary improvements carried out by the Public Health Department. I would again emphasise the importance of housing and further provisions for tho6are of old persons. Visits were made for possible action under section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, but I em pleased to say that it was not necessary to take legal action. STATISTICS. Area (i.n acres) 4,709 population (June 1950) Registrar General's Estimate 61,230 Resident Population (Census 1931) 29,396 Estimated number of separate habitable dwellings (houses and flats) in the Borough at the end of the year 17,600 Number of new houses erected during the year:- (a) By local authority 98 (b) By other local authorities 228 (c) By Metropolitan Water Board 23 (d) By private enterprise 69 (e) Rebuilt following destruction by enemy action 5 (f) Self-contained flats provided by conversion (private enterprise) 31 Rateable value at 1st April, 1950 £651,586 Sum represented by a penny rate £2,682 Prom the above it will be gathered that there has been an increase in the population from 60,110 in 1949 to 61,230 for 1950, the increase being 1,120 whirh includes the influx of people coming into the Borough and nutural increase. 4.

Food poisoning, now notifiable shows a tendency to increase, The increase can he attributed to the fact that there is a shortage in meat ana other rationed foods and in order to supply the people with food made-up dishes, pies, etc. are on sale to the public, the contents of which might be open to question and readily decompose if not kept in cold storage. 9.

IMPROVEMENT GRAFTS. The Housing Act, 1949, introduced a scheme to encourage property owners to modernise existing houses, " which though soundly constructed and in good general repair, lack the amenities and conveniences which have come to be regarded as essential to a decent and healthy life", by providing financial assistance for works of improvement. The Council decided to operate the new scheme for a trial period by making improvement grants In cases where new housing accommodation would be provided by the conversion of an existing building and where it was intended to improve the sanitary arrangements and/or the system of water heating. Rather surprisingly the number of enquiries about these grants has been very small indeed, and at the end of 1950 only four applications had been approved. These were all for the purpose of providing a bath, hot water system and indoor water-closet, and the grants made were £100. in three cases and £77.10.0. in the fourth. It is an unhappy fact that despite all the splendid achievements of the past 30 years in slum-clearance and reconditioning of houses, the time has not been found opportune to compel the provision of such necessities as a fixed bath and hot water supply before a house can be regarded as in all respects fit for habitation. Even today there are hundreds of houses in this Borough lacking such facilities. 22. FOOD PREMISES. Thirty-nine premises are registered under Section 14 Food & Drugs Act, 1938, for the preparation or manufacture of sausages, or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food intended for sale. On the 24th July, 1950, the Town Council adopted the new bye-laws of the Ministry of Food for securing the observance of sanitary and cleanly condilions and practices in connection with the handling, wrapping and delivery of food, and with the sale of food in the open air. My own opinion is that those byelaws are too indefinite to be of much use in a district such as this except as a means of focussing attention on the necessity for good habits amongst food handlers. It was unfortunate that their introduction coincided with a paper shortage so that the wrapping of food has not progressed as was hoped. The roundsman still presents a problem in hygiene which has yet to be satisfactorily solved, The question arose as to how the provisions of these byelaws could best be introduced to the traders and it was decided that it should be done by personal visits by the sanitary inspectors. By the end of the year the majority of the food shops, catering establishments, hotels, licensed premises etc, had received a visit from a sanitary inspector, who explained the new byelaws and other legislation dealing with precautions against contamination of food. Furthermore premises were inspected and the attention of traders drawn to any infringements. The co-operation of the traders was very good, nearly all showing a commendable desire to bring their promises as well as their technique into line with modern hygienic standards„ There follows a summary of works carried out to meet the requirements of the Council, mainly, be it noted, to comply with the Food & Drugs Act rather than the new byelaws Hot water supoly provided 40 New wash-basins provided 5 Soap and towel provided 9 New sinks provided 4 Arrangements for washing in adjoining premises 2 Rooms repaired and cleansed 41 Ventilation improved 2 W.Cs. cleansed or repaired 26 New W.Cs. provided 4 W.C. disconnected from food store 1 Artificial light provided in W.Cs. 8 Roof repaired 1 Drains cleansed or repaired 7 New dustbins provided 3 Accumulations of refuse removed 4 Gutters and rainwater pipes repaired 2 Drains relaid 1 Yard paving repaired 1 Food storage improved 4 Meat delivery van repaired and lined 1 Proper notices displayed re. sale of horseflosh. 1 23. Other works followed on in 1951 and will be referred to in my next report. Food premises in Surbiton are now on the whole reasonably equipped and conducted with due regard to hygienic principles, and I think they compare more than favourably with most towns in the country. This does not mean that there is no room for further improvement, but rather that we are up with the standards of the day, and I hope we shall continue to move forward when those standards progress to the higher plane which public opinion is beginning to demand# FOOD INSPECTION. The following foodstuffs found to be unfit for human consumption were surrendered by the owners, and either salvaged for animal feeding or destroyed. Article No. of Containers lbs. ozs .

There were no prosecutions. Action taken on non-genuine samples was as follows:- 969 (formal) Contained only 41 per cent of meat instead of Sausage meat. not less than 50 per cent. The matter was referred to the Ministry of Food in order that they could take appropriate action under the Meat Products and Canned Meat (Control & Maximum Prices) Order,1948. It was subsequently learned that a severe warning had been given in this case. 990 (informal) This substitute contained not more than 5 Pepper. per cent of white and black pepper and not less than 90 per cent of flour, with other spices and flavouring. Before a formal sample could be taken the commodity had been designated "Pepper compound" and, having regard to the amended description, no further action was necessary. 1028 (informal) Contained 1.44% w/v of anhydrous quinine Quinine,ammoniated instead of not less than 1.56% as specified tincture of in the British Pharmaceutical Codex. The matter was taken up with manufacturers and stocks were immediately withdrawn from 3ale. 1048 (informal) Contained 70 parts of copper per million Tomato Ketchup. parts of dried total solids whilst in the opinion of the Public Analyst not more than 50 parts should be permitted. The matter was taken up with the manufacturers and stock were immediately withdrawn from sale. ICE CREAM. Premises have been registered by the Corporation under Section 14, Pood & Drugs Act, 1938, as under:- For manufacture, storage and sale 19 For manufacture, storage and sale but manufacture to be limited to i ce—1o11xes 13 For storage and sale, but not manufacture 90 During the year 194 visits were made to premises and vehicles and 141 samples of ice cream were taken for laboratory examination for bacterial cleanliness, details being appended. It should be borne in mind that the methylene blue test for examining Ice-cream is still in the trial stage, and the Public Health Laboratory Service advises that it is unwise to Pay too much attention to the result of any one sample. Judgment should be based rather on a series of samples. It Is suggested that it would be reasonable to expect about 50 per cent of samples throughout the year to fall into Grade I, 80 per cent into Grades I or 2, not more than 20 per cent into Grade 3,and none into Grade 4. Owing to the large number of manufacturers whose ice-cream was sold in the Borough during the year it was not possible to take a series of samples from each, but as the table shows, efforts were made to repeat unsatisfactory samples till improvement was effected or the supply discontinued. 28. All retailers and manufacturers have been allotted a code number so that results can be published each year and compared with previous years. Each retailer from whom a sample was taken supplied with a copy of the laboratory report, and a Sanitary Inspector visited the premises and gave advice where report were not up to the standard expected. Where manufacture took place outside the Borough (as was so frequently the case) copies of reports vilr-XXior good or otherwise were also sent to the Sanitary Inspector for the district concerned for his information.

(i) At the end of the year there were twenty-seven entries on the register as follows:- Distributors of Milk residing in the Borough 12 Distributors of Milk residing outside the Borough but retailing in the Borough 6 Premises registered (used as Dairies) 9 (ii) Milk (Spcclal Designation) (Raw Mllk)RP£ulations, 1949 Milk (Special Designation" (Pasteuris" 2nd Sterilised Milk.) Regulations , 1949. Dealers' licences to sell designated milk wore granted as follows:- Pasteurised Milk 9 Pasteurised Milk (supplementary) 6 Tuberculin tested milk 9 Tuberculin tested milk (supplementary) 6 Sterilised milk 8 Sterilised milk (supplementary) 5 (III) 163 samples of milk were taken during the year and submitted to the undermentioned tests;- Turbidity Test Phosphatase Test Coliform Methylene Blue Test Test T.T. Pasteurised - 12 - 12 Pasteurised - 1.28 - 123 Sterilised 6 1 — 1 Channel Islands Pasteurised — 3 — 2 Heat Treated — 1 — 1 T.T. (Farm Bottled) - - 6 13 T.T. (Farm Bottled) All samples passed the prescribed tests except two samples of which failed the Methylene Blue Test. This was taken up with the dairymen and producers and subsequent samples proved satisfactory. The Phosphatase Test Indicates the pasteurisation has been properly carried out; the Methyler.??? Test is used to determine cleanliness and keeping quality, and the Turbidity Test is a check on sterilisation. The Coli form Test is no longer in use. There is now no raw milk sold in the Borough other than UnPasteurised Tuberculin Tested. 32. FACTORIES AND BAKEHOUSES. The total number of factories on the register at the end of the year was 239 (183 mechanical, 43 non-mechanical and 3 works of building construction). The businesses carried on at the respective premises were as follows:- Bakehouses 17 Laundries 9 Cleaners and Dyers 6 Tailors 4 Engineers (various) 34 Timber Yards 2 Manufacture of office appliances 1 Chemical manufacture and hairdressing sundries 1 Cellulose spraying and coach building 4 Stove enamelling and spray painting 1 Printers 10 Builders, Joiners and Plumbers 19 Boot repairers 13 Motor Engineers 20 Brickmaking 1 Fencing contractors 1 Concrete Products 3 Machine Tools 5 Instrument making 4 Metal Work 6 Fur glove makers 1 Cycle repairers 3 Radio and electrical engineers 5 Battery repair and manufacture 2 Spectacle frame and lens making 3 Plastics 2 Dental laboratories 3 Paint manufacturers 1 Works of building construction 3 Manufacture of breathing apparatus 1 Aircraft components 3 Blindmaking 1 Cardboard containers 1 Manufacture of rubber tyres, etc. 1 Accordion making 1 Cosmetics 2 Wireworks 2 Furniture making 2 Packing and food products 3 Pen manufacturers 2 Car breaking 1 Photography 2 Dressmaking 2 Loom weaving and church vestments 1 Upholstery 3 Clothing repairs 2 Miscellaneous 15 221 visits were made to these premises, and works were carried out to remedy contraventions found as under Want of cleanliness 5 factories Insufficient sanitary conveniences 3 " Defective, dirty or inadequately lighted sanitary conveniences 29 " Means of escape in ease of fire not in order 4 Other offences 3 " Four certificates were issued under section 34 of the Factori1-91 Act, 1937, that the factories to which they related were provided with such means of escape in case of fire for the persons employed 33. therein as may he reasonably required in the circumstances of the case. There were 80 outworkers on the register at the end of the year. 43 visits were made but no contraventions found. DUSTBINS. Twenty-seven dustbins were provided as a result of notices served. Three of the notices werstatutory and the remainder informal. The Council's scheme for the sale of dustbins as outlined In my Report for 1948 continues to be acceptable to the public, 86 bins being sold during the year. BUILDING LICENCES. During the year 75 visits were made in connection with licences and suitable recommendations made t:- Borough Surveyor who is Licensing Officer. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT. 1948. One burial was effected in accordance with Section 50 of the Act where it appeared that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body were being made otherwise than by the Council. PUBLIC MORTUARY. During the year 78 bodies were received into the mortuary for post mortem examination. The Council has now provided a refrigerator for the storage of bodies and this has already proved a great asset. DISINFECTION. (a). During the year disinfection was carried out at sixty premises in which the following diseases occurred. Anterior Poliomyelitis (or suspected) 15 Scarlet fever 15 Scabies 1 Cerebro-spinal Meningitis 5 Measles 1 Tuberculosis 20 Dysentery 3 Disinfection was also carried out at seventeen premises after cases of non-notifiable diseases, the occupier in each case paving the cost. (b) The total number of articles disinfected by steam at the Tolworth Hospital, or destroyed was Disinfected Destroyed.

DISINFESTATION. (a) Bed Bugs. Council Houses ' Other Houses. Found to be infested j Disinfested Found to be infest ed Disinfested - - 6 6 Methods employed for disinfestation:- Spraying with insecticide 5 Use of D.D.T. Powder 1 35. For the convenience of the public a stock of insecticides and sprayers is held in the Department, and these articles are sold at cost price when required. This service seems to be much appreciated. (b) School Canteens. At the request of the Surrey County Council 7 school canteens were sprayed with insocticide to prevent insect pests, the County Council paying the cost of the work. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION. The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 1949 became operative on 31st March, 1950. It is too early to comment upon the effect of the change in legislation; so far our work has continued as previously and it has not been necessary to make use of any of the enforcement sections. The Ministry of Agriculture & Fisheries continued its grant-aid of 50 per cent of the Irrecoverable expenditure incurred by the Council in carrying out its functions. Grant aid is not available in respect of expenditure incurred on treatment at commercial and industrial promises, and the full cost of the work must therefore be recovered from the occupiers. 25 courses of treatment were carried out at business premises by the Council's staff on payment by the occupiers of the cost involved. The Council continued to make no charge for treatment of infestations at private dwellings provided the occupiers took such steps as might from time to time be necessary and reasonably practicable for preventing their premises from becoming infested with rats and mice. This decision has considerably facilitated work on private property. Under the charging scheme there were constant disputes as to liability and one 'difficult' occupier frequently held up treatment on a block of property for long periods. Now, immediately an infestation is found, treatment can proceed, and the figures which follow indicate the extent of the work carried out during the year. 36. 1. VISITS.

The outbreak of Sonne Dysentery in the Hook and Chessington area during the Autumn involved the staff in a considerable amount of work before it was brought under control. This in some measure dislocated other contemplated activities, but every effort was made to keep up routine duties which are designed to prevent occurrences which may affect the health of the people, or alternatively to quickly 'spot' such happenings so that they can be dealt with. I referred in my last report to inspections under the Housing Act with the object of getting war-neglected properties re-instated to a reasonable condition. This work has continued and on the whole the response of property owners to the request for repairs to be effected has been good. The financial difficulties of landlords have not been lost sight of in making our demands, but I must say our problem would be easier if owners were not in the unhappy position of having to maintain houses on pre-war rents with today's cost of works. Generally speaking I think tenants appreciate this position and are more inclined themselves to carry out works for their own comfort especially internal decorations. Unfortunately, all are not in a position to do this, nor of course can we interfere with the legal relationship between landlord and tenant. To prepare a specification within the requirements of the repairs section of the Housing Act which (briefly) requires that a house shall be made in all respects fit at reasonable cost, taxes one's ingenuity under present circumstances. During the year I drew attention to the Unsatisfactory drainage arrangements in the outlying part of the Borough on the Leatherhead boundary, and the Borough Surveyor prepared a scheme for a sewer and small disposal plant. Unfortunately, the scheme had to be postponed for financial reasons, but it is hoped that despite the small number of properties involved the improvement will not have to be held over for too long, I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H.J. ELDRIDGE. Senior Sanitary Inspector. 40 I have to thank members of the staff of the Public Health Department for their assistance all of whom have carried out their work well. NEVILLE H.
