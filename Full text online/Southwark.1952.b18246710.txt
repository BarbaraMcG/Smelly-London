E.17. The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Metropolitan Borough of Southwark. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting my Annual Report for the year 1952. During the year under review the health of the Borough remained satisfactory. There were no alarming outbreaks of infectious diseases; in fact, there was a reduction of this type of case by almost a thousand cases as compared with the year 1951. In spite of this great diminution of the infectious diseases, statistics unfortunately show an increase of the infant mortality rate by as much as ten per thousand births. The principal causes of this rise in infant deaths are due to a considerable increase in the deaths from congenital malformations and pneumonia. The most alarming experience of the year was the week of fog experienced in the early part of December. During this week deaths were treble their usual number and it is due to this fact that the general death rate for the year was higher than usual. The after effects of the fog remained with us for several weeks after its dispersal. I reported fully to the Health Committee at the time and there is also a reference to it in the body of the Report. I would like to add, however, that so long as we persist in "keeping the home fires burning" with soft bituminous coal the danger of a similar occurrence is ever with us. The work of the Department during the year was very heavy as the figures in this Report indicate. Some of this increase was due to the renewed activity of the Council of its powers and duties under the Housing Act, particularly that in connection with the clearance of old and out-dated property of which there still remains much in the Borough. 11 Once more I wish to thank the members of the Council for their consideration and understanding, the staff of the Public Health Department, and the Chief Officers and staffs of other Departments for their loyal co-operation. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, W. STOTT, Medical Officer of Health. 1 PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE (As at December 31st, 1952). Chairman—J. J. Sheen. A Idermen: Mrs. E. L. Maddison, J. F.

The current population estimated includes members of H.M. Forces stationed in the area. The birth-rate continued to fall, but there was again an increase in the death-rate. There was a decline in the stillbirth rate but the infant death-rate was the highest since 1949.

The total number of deaths of infants under one year of age was 49, the causes of death beinsr as follows: Gastritis, Enteritis and Diarrhoea 4 Meningococcal Infeotions 1 Pneumonia 8 Bronchitis 2 Congenital malformations 12 Other defined and ill-defined diseases 21 All aooidents, other than by motor vehicle 1 Total deaths under 1 year of age 49 Maternal Mortality. One maternal death was recorded during the year. Infectious Diseases The final figures of corrected diagnoses of Infectious Diseases in the Borough during 1952 were only about twothirds of the previous year's totals. Substantial decreases will be noted in Dysentery, Measles and Whooping Cough, but in comparison with 1951, the current cases of Food Poisoning, Poliomyelitis, Pneumonia, Scabies and Scarlet Fever show an appreciable increase. There were four cases of Diphtheria, the highest since 1949; these all occurred together in an L.C.C. institution. There was very little change in the number of Tuberculosis notifications. Whilst the deaths from pneumonia were exactly the same as for 1951, those from Influenza were fewer; in both cases they were mostly in the over-45 age groups. There was an increase in respiratory Tuberculosis deaths, the majority being in the 45-64 age groups. Only one other death from defined notifiable infectious diseases occurred, that of a baby from meningococcal infection. PUERPERAL PYREXIA There was again an increase in these notifications. Of the 30 cases, 27 developed the infection in hospitals subsequent to admission for confinement; the remaining 3 cases were in home confinements. 7 CANCER OF LUNG AND BRONCHUS Deaths From. Neoplasm of Lung and Bronchus Respiratory Tuberculosis All Causes 1946 39 62 1358 1947 30 77 1436 1948 J9 81 1214 1949 44 60 1261 1950 47 51 1192 1951 49 32 1324 1952 51 45 1377 The highest mortality rate from both neoplasms of the lung and bronchus and also tuberculosis occurred in the 45 to 64 age group. TUBERCULOSIS The Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1952, revoked and replaced the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1930, which became outdated and at variance with the present structure and operation of the tuberculosis services. The requirement regarding notification itself remains, in effect, unaltered, and the Minister of Health has emphasised the need for the closest co-operation between sanitary authorities, welfare authorities and the regional hospital boards. PUBLIC HEALTH (AIRCRAFT) REGULATIONS, 1952 These Regulations superseded the 1950 Regulations, and were made in conformity with International Sanitary Regulations adopted by the Fourth World Health Assembly in May, 1951, for the sanitary control of aircraft arriving at or leaving aerodromes in England and Wales. 8 IMMUNISATION There was again a substantial increase in Diphtheria Immunisation during 1952, particularly for children over five and the ' 'booster'' injections. The number of Whooping Cough immunisations was also considerably more than for the previous year.

Body-lice infestations were, with few exceptions, confined to aged persons and some vagrants. This fact may well be indicative of the general higher standards of living. Aged and infirm people who might have required cleansing were visited at regular intervals and conveyed to the Centre for treatment when necessary. Pubic lice infestations commonly occurred only to adult male persons, but some instances of this form of infestation were observed on children's hair and eyebrows. The somewhat higher figure for the treatment of premises with various forms of insect vermin infestations is understandable, in view of the early warm summer, and the fact that, in general, the public now realise that with the availability of modern means of disinfestation, such infestations need not be endured. The higher number of infectious disease enquiries and visits was due mainly to the increase in Scarlet Fever notifications, many of which were nursed at home. In addition, disinfection of premises was offered to the occupants in every case of the removal to hospital or the death of a Tuberculosis sufferer. 24 demonstrations, attended by 153 students, were held at the Centre during the year. Those attending were mostly student nurses and medical students. A considerable amount of work was carried out in connection with burials under the National Assistance Act. The goods and effects of such cases are collected, disinfected and stored at the Centre prior to arrangements made for their removal. In addition to the above, the functions of the Centre include disinfection and disinfestation of trade goods, and bedding, etc., in connection with the Councils' rehousing scheme; and also departmental laundry.

This was particularly the case in connection with food and food premises, and decreases in the number of drainage and rehousing visits were more than offset by a much higher number of revisits. The total figures show nearly 1,000 more inspections than in 1951. Fewer intimation notices were issued, but 432 more statutory notices were served than in 1951, and 192 more complied with. SUMMARY OF INSPECTIONS (Separate statistics for certain of the following headings are given in the Housing section).

COMMON LODGING HOUSES There are four women's and two men's common lodging houses in the Borough, which are fully occupied nightly. Forty-five inspections of these premises were made by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year, 6 of men's lodging houses and 39 of women's. 6 Intimation notices were served in respect of Women's Common Lodging Houses, of which 5 have been complied with. HYDROGEN CYANIDE (FUMIGATION) ACT, 1937 The Hydrogen Cyanide (Fumigation of Buildings) Regulations No. 1759-1951) replaced those made in 1938 under the Act, with corresponding regulations governing the fumigation of ships, Hydrogen Cyanide (Fumigation of Ships) Regulations No. 1760-1951. HOSTEL BY-LAWS Early in the year it was suggested that consideration should be given to the making of by-laws under Section 155 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, relating to hostels in the Borough. These would simplify the inspection of certain premises being used as hostels. A hostel was defined as premises other than a common lodging house as interpreted under section 235 of the Public Health Act, 1936, where sleeping accommodation with or without meals is provided for six or more lodgers not of the same family, who occupy common sleeping rooms. 16 The by-laws made provision for inspections, sleeping accommodation, cleansing and ventilation, and sanitary arrangements, and after approval by the Minister of Housing and Local Government came into effect on 1st October, 1952. WATER SUPPLY The domestic water supply of the Borough is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board, and has been satisfactory in quality and quantity. During the year, three complaints were received regarding the taste of water. The Metropolitan Water Board was informed and samples analysed. In two cases the cause was a dirty storage tank, and discolouration due to disturbance of the mains; the third sample was satisfactory.

The Act includes requirements as to the suitability of the accommodation; the adequate supply of suitable food and drink for animals; that mammals are not to be sold at too early an age ; and for reasonable precautions against fire and spread of infectious diseases amongst animals. It is also an offence to sell animals as pets in any part of the street or public place except at a stall or barrow in a market, or to children under twelve years of age. The Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee recommended conditions to be applied to all licences issued. Of twenty-two applications received, seventeen were found to be satisfactory, and accordingly registered under the Act. 221 Inspections were made during the year. SMOKE ABATEMENT. The figures of deposited matter in the vicinity of the Bankside area were again very high, and as in previous years, the main source of pollution was due to grit emitted from the chimneys of the old Bankside Generating Station. There has been considerable correspondence and interviews with the British Electricity Authority, who still consider that the cost of fitting grit arresters would not be justified. In May, 1952, there was a discussion at the Town Hall on the comprehensive report prepared by the Fuel Research Station on the problem. The representatives of the British Electricity Authority stated that the use of the old station had been reduced and the Authority were desirous of discontinuing the use of the station as soon as possible, as the plant was uneconomic. It was hoped that the first unit of the new power station would be in operation before the end of 1952, and a further unit by the middle of next year. This would mean a rapid reduction in the use of the old plant. It was estimated there would be four months' use in the winter of 1952-53, and about two months during the following winter, subject to normal weather conditions. Whilst it was proposed to keep the old station available until 1956, the "use factor" would be exceedingly small. The Authority submitted that the installation of grit arresters at this time would be a waste of money. They would, however, make every endeavour to minimise the nuisance. The figures of the deposited matter as recorded on the sites in Walworth Road and Bankside are as follows:— 21 1952 Walworth Road Bankside January 21.4 151.6 tons per sq. mile. February 23.0 98.1 ,, ,, ,, ,, March 28.2 51.4 ,, ,, ,, ,, April 16.2 48.9 ,, ,, ,, ,, May 17.9 28.7 ,, ,, ,, ,, June 15.6 63.7 ,, ,, ,, ,, July 9.9 38.5 ,, ,, ,, ,, August 16.0 42.4 ,, ,, ,, ,, September 18.2 66.7 ,, ,, ,, ,, October 24.4 67.9 ,, ,, ,, ,, November 24.8 42.7 ,, ,, ,, ,, December 24.9 192.4 ,, ,, ,, ,, During the year seven complaints were received regarding smoke emissions in the Borough, and 122 observations and visits were made by the Inspector. FOG. In December London experienced a very severe fog. It commenced and gradually became worse on Friday, 4th December, lifted somewhat on the 7th, but returned the next day. The peculiar atmospheric conditions prevailing at the time appeared to be similar to those which occurred in the Meuse Valley in December, 1930, and Donora, Penn., U.S.A., in October, 1948, and which were entirely due to atmospheric pollution; they were responsible for a large amount of respiratory illnesses and many deaths of the people living in these particular valleys. By the time the fog had abated there was a heavy incidence of respiratory illness and mortality amongst those suffering from chest and heart troubles, particularly older people. The total deaths in the Borough from Influenza, Pneumonia, Bronchitis and other respiratory diseases for the two weeks from December 6th to 20th were 95, as compared with 76 from the same causes for the three months' period from November, 1951, to January, 1952. Whilst some of the persons who died had previous histories of respiratory disorders, others died suddenly in their sleep without previous illness. The atmospheric pollution at the time was so heavy our instruments were incapable of measuring the quantity. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951. During the year twelve samples were taken and submitted to the prescribed Analyst, Mr. John Hudson, M.A., F.C.S., Chiltern Research Laboratories, Ltd., High Wycombe. Two of these samples did not comply with the requirements of the 22 Regulations, and cautionary letters were sent to the manufacturers. Nine premises are registered for the use of filling materials, and one licensed for manufacture or storage of Rag Flock. One licence was discontinued. HAIRDRESSING ESTABLISHMENTS. The Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee was requested to consider whether barbers' shops and hairdressing establishments should be subject to registration, and the cleanliness of premises, instruments, towels, materials and equipment, and of persons employed, should be made the subject of by-laws.

Food THE INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD During the year, 2,878 tons, 12 cwts., 15 lbs. of food were examined in detail at wharves, warehouses, shops, etc., in the Borough. Of this amount, 235 tons, 2 cwts, 1 qtr., 251bs. were fo und to be unfit for human consumption, and were disposed of as follows:— Destroyed—117 tons 3 cwts. 9 lbs. comprising mainly— 23 tons puree, pulp and fruit 2 tons poultry. juices. 8 tons tinned vegetables. 11 tons cooked hams. 2 tons dried fruit. 4 tons confectionery. 1½ tons offal. 1 ton vegetables. 1¼ tons meat. 10 tons meat products. 1¼ tons bacon. 4 tons tinned fish. 1 ton tinned meat. 44 tons tinned fruit. 1 ton preserves. 1 ton tinned soup.

Inspected at wharves and warehouses 5 tons 19 cwts. 1 qtr. 8 lbs. LIQUEUR CHOCOLATES The Ministry of Food, as a result of the successful prosecution of a manufacturer of "liqueur chocolates," has been in consultation with Associations representing chocolate and sugar confectionery manufacturers concerning the description to be applied to products containing a non-spirituous flavoured syrup. It has been agreed that they should in future be described as "Imitation liqueur chocolates (non-alcoholic)." The Ministry suggested that food and drug authorities should allow a reasonable time to elapse before considering proceedings in respect of samples that may be found in their area still bearing the old description of "liqueur chocolates." 25 ICE CREAM (HEAT TREATMENT, ETC.) (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS, 1952 These Regulations provide for a third method of heat treatment of ice cream mixture as alternative to the two existing methods prescribed by the 1947-51 Regulations. ICE CREAM There are 182 ice-cream dealers and 22 manufacturers in this Borough, an increase of 12 dealers, and a decrease of 5 manufacturers since last year. Most of the dealers sold only prepacked ice-cream, obtained from the large manufacturers. During the year 69 samples of ice-cream were taken with the following results:— 35 samples, Grade I. 15 samples, Grade II. 9 samples, Grade III. 10 samples, Grade IV, In addition: 27 samples were chemically examined for compliance with the prescribed standards of composition of ice-cream. Two of these samples did not contain the requisite amount of fat and the vendors were cautioned. Samples subsequently taken at the premises were satisfactory. Periodical visits were made to all premises. A "Code of Standards" was sent to each new dealer and inspections were carried out before the registration of any new premises to ensure that they were satisfactory and all requirements fully understood. Copies of the Public Analyst's reports on samples taken were forwarded to the vendors concerned. In the case of Grade III and IV samples, special investigations were made at the premises in an effort to detect some fault which may have caused the unsatisfactory gradings. FOOD STANDARDS (ICE-CREAM) (AMENDMENT) ORDER, 1952 This Order came into operation in July, 1952; it amends the Food Standards (Ice-Cream) Order, 1951, and reduces, from 7th July, 1952, the minimum quantity of fat and milk solids other than fat required to be contained in ice-cream. The modified standard became necessary in order to avoid a reduction in the supply of ice-cream, as owing to shortages milk powder and fats could not be allocated to ice-cream manufacturers at the same rate as in 1951. 26 DESIGNATED MILK During the year the following Licences were issued under the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949, and Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949. 1 Pasteuriser's Licence. 101 Dealers' Licences for Pasteurised Milk. 135 Dealers' Licences for Sterilised Milk. 81 Dealers' Licences for Tuberculin Tested Milk. Supplementary Licences. 13 Supplementary Licences for Pasteurised Milk. 13 Supplementary Licences for Sterilised Milk. 12 Supplementary Licences for Tuberculin Tested Milk. Fifty-four samples of Designated Milks were taken and submitted to the Public Analyst for examination. All these satisfied the prescribed tests. Forty-eight samples of Pasteurised Milk supplied to local schools were also examined by the Public Analyst, and the London County Council informed of the results. MILK SELLERS At the close of the year there were 164 registered milk distributors in the Borough, whilst the number of distributors purveying milk in the Borough from registered premises elsewhere was 21. 343 Inspections of Milkshops and Dairies were made during the year. PUBLIC HEALTH (CONDENSED MILK) REGULATIONS, 1923 and 1947 Thirteen samples of condensed milk were purchased for analysis under the above regulations. They were all certified by the Public Analyst to comply with the said regulations. SLAUGHTERHOUSES There is only one licensed slaughterhouse in the Borough, which is not in use. Four inspections of the premises were made during the year to ensure that no slaughtering was in operation. 27 CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS There are 445 catering establishments in the Borough. These include riverside snack bars, cafes, coffee stalls, mobile snack bars, public house restaurants, and industrial canteens, all of which have received systematic inspection during the past year. Notices were served and a considerable amount of work has been carried out. As a result, there has been a marked improvement in the general condition of premises, and a reasonably high standard is being maintained. Close contact has been kept with the Local Food Office in regard to the proposed new premises and traders, to ensure that all premises comply with Public Health requirements before the issue of food licences. BAKEHOUSES At the end of the year there were 31 Bakehouses in use in Southwark, of which 8 were underground. During the year Basement Bakehouses at 21 Ontario Street and 304 Old Kent Road were closed by the occupiers. 127 visits were made by the Inspector. BY-LAWS FOR THE PROTECTION OF FOOD New by-laws were made by the London County Council under Section 15 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, for securing the observance of sanitary and cleanly conditions and practices in connection with the handling, wrapping and delivery of food sold or intended for sale for human consumption, and in connection with the sale or exposure for sale in the open air of food intended for human consumption. The new by-laws came into operation on the 3rd November, 1952, on which date the by-laws made by the London County Council under Section 6 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1932, ceased to have effect. FOOD STANDARDS (COFFEE MIXTURES) ORDER, 1952 This Order, prescribing a minimum coffee content for coffee and chicory mixtures and for coffee with fig flavour or fig seasoning, came into force in September, 1952, for all sales. 28 The minimum coffee content prescribed for coffee and chicory mixtures is the same as that maintained in the Coffee Order, 1951, until that Order was revoked on August 20th, 1952. The standard prescribed for coffee and fig mixtures is introduced for the first time. The new Order also provided that coffee and chicory mixtures shall contain only coffee and chicory, and that coffee and fig mixtures shall contain only coffee and figs. MINERAL OIL IN FOOD (AMENDMENT) ORDER, 1952 This Order was amended by Statutory Instrument, 1952, No. 1822, so as to reduce the less amount of mineral oil that may be present in dried fruit from not more than 1 part per 100 parts by weight of dried fruit to not more than 0.5 parts per 100 parts by weight of dried fruit. Corresponding reductions were made as respects the mineral oil content of foods in which dried fruit has been used as an ingredient. The Ministry explain that a satisfactory substitute for mineral oil for the surface treatment of dried fruit has not yet been found. Investigation into alternative methods of treatment is still proceeding, and it is hoped that it may be possible eventually to dispense with the need to use mineral oil for this purpose. THE MEAT PRODUCTS No. 2 ORDER, 1952 THE MEAT PRODUCTS (AMENDMENT) ORDER, 1952 This Order re-enacts with amendments the Meat Products Order, 1952, which replaced the Meat Products and Canned Meat (Control and Maximum Prices) Order, 1948, as amended. Among other things the Order prescribes a minimum meat content requirement for the majority of meat products. The definition of "meat" for the purpose of the Order has been amended, and no longer includes poultry, game, rabbit, hare, venison or goats-flesh. The restriction on the use of soya in the manufacture of sausages is removed; and milk powder and vegetable fat will no longer count as part of the meat content. It is, however, the Ministry's intention to provide sausage manufacturers with individual licences allowing milk powder to count as part of the meat content until their present stocks of milk powder are exhausted. 29 THE PUBLIC HEALTH (MEAT) (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS, 1952 These Regulations amend, from the 31st August, 1952, the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924, as amended, so as to extend to horses, asses and mules the application of Part II of those Regulations which relate to slaughter-houses and the slaughter of cattle, swine, sheep and goats for sale for human consumption and requires, inter alia, not less than three hours' notice to the Council of intention to slaughter. The Regulations should facilitate the inspection of meat intended for sale for human consumption derived from horses, asses and mules, and the prior notice of intention to slaughter such animals should be useful in the execution and enforcement of the provisions of the Slaughter of Animals Acts, 1933 and 1951. FOOD STANDARDS (SUET) ORDER, 1952 This Order came into force in December, 1952, prescribing a standard for block suet and revising the standard for shredded suet. The standards require that the fat contained in both types of suet shall be refined beef fat only. JELLIED VEAL. Two separate consignments, each comprising 140 cases of imported Jellied Veal from Australia, were detained in cold store at New Hibernia Wharf, owing to a high percentage of blown tins. Samples submitted for bacteriological examination disclosed heavy contamination, and following further tests all blown and doubtful tins were surrendered for destruction, and the remainder freed. The Medical Officers of Health of the districts receiving the apparently sound tins were warned of our action. PORK IN NATURAL JUICES. A consignment of Pork in Natural Juices from Belgium was detained at Stamford Cold Store in August. Thirteen representative samples were submitted for bacteriological examination on three separate occasions; and the results showed that "the tins are not processed under conditions which ensure sterility, they are subject to spoilage at atmospheric temperature, and cannot be considered safe for human consumption unless the instructions to keep under refrigeration are rigidly carried out." Almost half of the tins in the consignment were blown; eighteen appearing normal were taken from the remainder and kept at normal room temperature, and within 24 hours seventeen were blown. After discussions with representatives of the Importers and the Insurance Assessors the surrender of the whole consignment was accepted. 30 FOOD SAMPLING During the year under review, 807 formal samples and 960 informal samples were submitted to the Public Analyst. Of these, 16 and 35 respectively revealed adulteration or other infringements, as follows samples Examined.

On the 20th October, 1952, information was received from H.M. Customs, Grande Vitesse Depot, that 22,000 trays of Spanish Grapes had been imported, and some were coated with a white powder. Distribution of the majority had already taken place, but a check sample was taken and the Public Analyst reported on the 23rd October, 1952, as follows:— I. Grapes with adhering loose dust. Arsenic—2 parts per million. Lead 16 parts per million. II. After thorough brushing to remove all loose dust, a film of adhering dust remaining. Arsenic 1 part per million. Lead 9 parts per million. III. After washing with dilute acid and water. Arsenic—nil. Lead 6 parts per million. Immediate representations were made to the Importers, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Food, and Spanish Embassy. The grapes came from Almeira and the particular area concerned was Dallas. As a result of our representations grapes from the Dallas area were stopped at the Spanish frontier. One truck escaped this 'stop,' and on arrival in this country it was re-exported. 31 Formal Samples: No. Sample of Result.

There is, however, practically no improvement yet in the number of such cases rehoused. Illegal overcrowding is sometimes deliberately caused in an effort to secure priority rehousing, and although under existing conditions it is seldom practicable to take action in these cases, the most careful investigations are made to ensure that they do not receive recommendations for rehousing. The housing shortage renders it necessary to impose severe limitations in recommending only the most serious medical cases. Although medical recommendations during the year were only two less than those made in 1951, sixteen fewer cases were rehoused. 40 468 cases were referred to the London County Council and Borough Council for rehousing on sanitary grounds (as distinct from medical or overcrowding recommendations). During the year 115 cases in this category were rehoused.

It is gratifying to note that Miss Mary Morris, the Organising Secretary of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee, in her Annual Report has been able to claim considerable and encouraging progress in her difficult task, mainly as a result of increased financial support and generous help from the Council, voluntary workers, local organisations and individuals in the Borough. The former Navillus Civic Restaurant has been converted into a congenial luncheon club for old people, supplying up to 160 meals daily, with comfortable amenities for a Social Club and Library. Meals on Wheels have been extended to provide a service four days a week, and up to the end of the year under review, 1,170 meals have been sent to housebound old people, in addition to 943 to the Women's Voluntary Service. Plans are being made to increase this service further to cope with the increase in demand. Through the generosity of Mr. N. Howard Tertis, F.C.Ch., L.Ch., who has given his services free, a monthly Chiropody Clinic was commenced during the year. It is hoped to acquire more suitable premises, and to increase the sessions to weekly intervals. Parties, outings and other social functions have been arranged, also a fortnight's holiday at Broadstairs, part of the cost of which was paid by the old people themselves through a savings scheme. It is, however, hoped that by means of a National Assistance Act grant, the holiday scheme can be extended to include those who need a rest and change on medical grounds, but who are unable to afford a contribution. At the same time the needs of the housebound and handicapped who may not be able to participate in these pleasures are not being overlooked in future plans. Nearly 400 aged sick persons were referred to this Committee by hospitals, doctors, district nurses, etc., and all were visited by the Organising Secretary, and efforts made to assist them as necessary. Voluntary visitors have given invaluable help in visiting both the sick and the many old people who are deprived of companionship through being unable to leave their homes. 44 There still remains an urgent need for more persons with sufficient spare time and the necessary sympathy and patience for this most important work. Seventy-six cases were referred to the Public Health Department during the year. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT. Compulsory Removals. During the year one case was dealt with under Section 47, and the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, which provides for the removal of persons in need of care and attention. The person concerned was aged and living under insanitary conditions owing to neglect and in need of proper care and attention. She had refused assistance, and an Order was made for her compulsory removal to hospital, but she died soon after admission. Burial of the Dead. During the year the Council arranged for eighteen burials under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, at a total cost of £175 2s. 6d. MORTUARY.
