FR 113 FRIERN BARHET URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. March 25th 1922. To the Chairman and Members of the friern Barnet Urban District Ccunoil. Miss Donald and Gentlemen, I beg to present to you my report for the year ending 31 at December 1921. In accordance with the instructions, Cire. 269, received from the Ministry of Health, this report will be known as an "Ordinary Report" and will be confined within the limits set out in paragraph 5. In accordance with paragraph 3, only reports of full and detailed character will be required at intervals of not more than five years, those reports are designated by the Ministry as"Survey Reports". The primary object of future "Survey Reports" will be to review the needs of the area in tho relation the the protection of Public Health an d the progress made in meeting these needs since the date of tho proceeding "Survey Report". Special instructions are to be issued In regard to the preparation of the next "Survey Report", which will be for the year 1925. I have pleasure in expressing to the Members of the Council my appreciation of their unfailing courtesy and assistance during the past year and to your Sanitary Inspector, Mr. A. Harman, ( a summary cf whose activities is attached to this report in Table 6.) who has prepared the statistical data and memoranda and rendered valuable assistance generally in the preparation of this report., I am, Miss Donald and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, FRANK A. SPREAT. Medical Officer of Health. AREA OF THE DISTRICT. The total area of the District is 1304 acres. of which approximately 488 acres are built upon, 300 acres under grass or allotments, 63 acres arable or used for market gardening purposes, 73 acres are parks or public open spaces, 86 acres of golf links, 152 acres occupied by the Colney Hatch Mental Hospital and remaining 188 acres not yet fit for building upon. POPULATION, The Census of the District was taken on the 19th June. The figures from the Registrar-General's preliminary report being:- Friern Farnet (excluding Asylum) Males 6520 Females 8006 Total 14496 Asylum Males 1093 Females l762 Total 2885 Totals for the whole District Males 7613 females 9768 Total 17381 The Genius figures for the separate wards, together with the number of separate occupiers, are not yet available, They may be taken as the same as the separate number of assessments. In a memorandum from the Registrar-General it is pointed out that the Consua of 1921 was taken at a time when soma holiday movement was already in progress and that this movement was reflected in the consus Returns. The Registrar has therefore estimated the population of friern barnet at the middle of the years aa 17510. For the purpose of compiling the Death and Birth Returns, which are based on population, I am using the figure 14500, whioh is the nearest figure we can arrive at for the District alone. BIRTHS. These number 293, giving a birth rate of 20.4 per thousand, a drop of nearly 5 per thousand on the preoeeding year, The Registrar-General gives the birth rate of England and wales as 22.4; the 96 Great Towns, including London, 23.3; 148 Smaller Towns, 22.7; London, 22.3, The number of illegitimate births was 7, The number of births notified to the Medical Officer of Health under the Notification of Births Act was 276, this is a percentage notification of 94,5. The best yet recorded. which are as follows:- Occupied un-Occupied. North ward 678 9 Central ward 1046 16 South Ward 1261 12 2985 37 Deaths The total number of deaths registered as belonging to the District was 147, giving a death rate of 10.1 per thousand, 43 of these deaths were of residents who died outside the District and 4 were of non-residents, making a nett number of deaths belonging to the District of 143, and a nett death's rate of 9.9. This compares very favourably with the deaths rate of the past five years for the District.The registrar-General gives the death rate of England and Wales as 12,1? 96 Great Towns, 12,3; 148 Smaller towns,11.3, London, 12,4, but in such comparisan One must bear in mind that the death rate 9.9 is not Corrected for the age and sex distribution and until the Census reports are available showing the number of deaths in England and wales under the various age and sex groups used in table 3, such correcotion cannot be applied. The correcting factor varies slightly at each census. The only available factor is based on the inter-genral year 1891-1901, which is to old to be INFECTIOUS DISEASE. The total number of notifications received under the notifications acts and the various Orders made under section 130 of the public health act 170. DYSENTARY. Those numbered 19 and all occurred in the mental hospital. Those cases were of the type that ordinarily oocur In a metal hospital and should be differentiated from the Dysentery which oceurd in tropical and sub -tropical regions. ENOSTHALISIS ????. Two cases were notified, both in the south and but no connection between them could be traced.Both were children, fhe girl was removed to southgate. Hospital and safe a good recovery. The boy was too ill for removal to hospital and the case -proved rapisly fatal. A report on each case was prepared with the assistance of the notifying practitioner and forwarded to the iniatry of health. ENTERIC FEVER. Sight cases were notified, six of which occurred in the Asylun. One oocurred in the south ?? and was removed to hospital, he made a good recovery. Not history of the source of infection could be traced. One case occurred in the North ward, a girl who contracted the disease whilst on holiday. She was treated at home and made a good recovery. The widal test in this case proved positive. DIPHTHERIA Twenty-saven cases ware notified, spread avanly throughout the year. nineteen cases ware ramoved to hospital.The disease was of a mild tyre, two deaths occurred, giving a death rate of 0.138, The attack rate for this disease is 1.86. SCARLET FEVER. Seventy-five cases were notified, the majority of which occurred in the spring and early summer and lata autumn and inter. The prevalence of the disease if the highest since 1908, but did not reach epidemic conditions at any time. Seventy cases were removed to hospital. There were two deaths from this disease giving a death rate of 0.138. The attack rate for this disease is 5.175. SMALL- POX. One case was notified and prompt measures were taken to isolate the contacts, and the case was removed to hospital at Yeading. after a few days in hospital the case was shown not to be small pox. PUE???? TUBEROLESIS Seventeen cases were notified, ten of which received sanatorium treatment. DRYSISELAS Eight cases were notified, sevan in the District and one in the mental hospital. INFLUENZA. This disease was prevalent to some extant during the year. On the whole it waa not of a severe type. There were two deaths, one at each of the age periods 45-65 and 6 5 and oyer. It was mainly characterised- by one of the three following types:- (1) A very painful condition of the throat, (angina) associated with acuta middle ear trouble. (2) Digestive symptoms, accompanied with, in a few cases, sub-acute peritonitis of the upper abdominal regions. (3) In the later stages affections of the larger joints, knee, ankle,with a tendancy to a very slow recovery. HOSPITALS AND AMBULANCE Our agreement with southgate for the use of 12 beds at their isolation hospital. Tottenhall road, Palmers Green, continues. The beds have been fully utilised and at timeshave been insufficient for the needs of the district. We have however been able to abtain beds at the London Fever Hospital for our overflow cases and I wish to ewms my thanks and appreciation of the kindness of the authorities at this hospital in so promptly and courteously meeting our requests. The cost of maintenance of patients in hospital has greatly increased and it has been necessary to modify the arrangements entered into with the Sothtgate Council in 1909. The ambulance for the removal of infectious disease is that belonging to the finchley Council. The sanitary Inspector personally arranges for and removes these cases. Priern Barnet not having a hospital staff it is practically impossiblie to keep an ambulance for its work. The neighbouring district of southgate has a well equipped ambulance with an efficient staff for dealing withi/cases other than those of an infectious nature, and Friern farnet can have tho use of this ambulance at the charge necessary to cover the costs of running. This on the average works out at about 17/- per Journey. This ambulance was used 13 times during the year at a total cost to the District of Â£4-4-0, the balance being paid by the users. MIDVIVES. The County Council is the supervising authority for the midwives in this District. There are two midwives on the register who are working in this District. CLINICS AND TREATMENT CENTERS. There are two in the District. One conneotod with the education Authority under the control of the Middlesex County Council and one in the South ward provided by the narishioners of the St. Peter's Parish. SMALL POX. Frriern barnet is one of the authorities constituting the Middlesex Joint small-box Hospital Board. LABORATORY WORK. This is carried out by the Clinical Research Association. Every medical practitioner, residing in the District, is supplied with a sterile swab, in metal screw case, direct from the laboratory and also with a sputum bottle properly packed in metal case. Widal outfits and additional swabs and sputum outfits are kert at the Public NOTIFIABLE FECTCOUS DISEASES. The number or notifiable infectious diseases (apart from Tuberculosis) reported during the year was 80. This shows a great reduction irom last year when the number was 74. The reduction in chiefly in the cases or Diphtheria and the Pneumonias. There were 5 cases of Diphtheria against 17, and 8 cases of Acute Primary Pneumonia against 19 last year. There were no cases of Influenzal Pneumonia, of which there were 6 last year There were II cases of Scarlet Fever against 7 last year : This increase being due to the large number of cases from one house, Greenwood Cottage, Haydon. There was a solitary case of Enteric Fever reported from Writhlington, the origin of which could not be traced, and one case of Orththalmia Neonatorum at beclcingxon. The following table will show the distribution cf the cases - Sub-District No.I Diphtheria Scarlet Fever Erysipelas Malaria Pneumonia Enteric Longleat 1 Standerwick 1 Beckington 2 4 & 1 case of Ophthalmia nernat-orum Wanstrow 1 1 1 sub-District no.2 Forscote 1 Holcombe 1 Writhlington 1 Haydon 5 1 1 Coleford 1 4 Highbury 1 Leigh on Mendip 2 5 11 3 1 8 1 See also Tables in Appendix. TUBERCULOSIS. The number of cases of Pulmowary Tuberculosis (phthisis) notified was 15, the same number as last year and 2 cases of Tuberculosis of other parts of the body. There were 4 deaths from Phthisis but only one of these was in the District:The other three were former residents in the District, who died elsewhere and whose deaths were transferred by the Registrar General. Notification of cases of Tuberculosis is thoroughly carried out by the Medical Practitioners of the District and no un-notified case has been discovered. The number of notified cases still resident in the district at the end of the year was:- 1. Pulmonary cases 38 2. Non-Pulmonary cases 3 41 See also Tables in appendix. (5) LABORATORY WORK:â During the year 29 swabs were sent to the county Laboratory for examination; of these, 6 were reported "positive", and 24 "negative," One specimen or spatum was sent for examination. This was negative as regards Tubercle Bacilli. A supply of fresh Diptheria Anti-Toxin is always Kept on hand hy me, and has been promptly distributed to the Medical practitioners whenever required. EPIDEMICS:- No disease has heen epidemic during the year. The district has, indeed, been remarkably free rrom disease or all Kinds; due in great measure, no doubt, to the long continued sunny, dry weather. HOSPITALS:- The number cf patients from tne Rural District treated in the Victoria Hospital, Frome in 1921 was 29. The number treated in the Froce- Infirmary was 19. The temporary Isolation Hospital at Colerord was still open at the beginning of the year with one Diphtheria patient - admitted last December. Tnere were 4 other Diphtheria cases admitted this year, 1 in Jaruary and three in february. The Hospital was closed on march the 12th and reopened in June, and again in August for the Scarlet Fever cases form Groverwood Cottage, Hayden -5 in all. These cases had all recovered, and the Hospital was closed finally on November 7th. (6) HOUSING. THE NEW COUNCIL HOUSES.- The 52 houses under construction last year have been completed, with the change of health Ministry and the cutting off of Government grants which were to have been built in the Spring , had to be abandoned - at least for the present. The 52 houses completed are situated as follows Mells 24: Highbury (Coleford) 24; Haydon 4. All these are in the mining part or the district, and were intended to provide accommodation for the miners; while the remaining 37 were intended for the Agricultural labourers, It is doubtful, however, if the ??heme has been a success, in spite of its great expense, in relieving the condition of the people it was intended for. There appear to be only about 10 miners among the tenants, many of the rest being drawn from quite a different class and coming from places outside the district, and even outside the County. Many of the houses are vacant, swing to the difficulty of finding t enants able to pay the rent and rates. If the other houses had been built, i think it would have been very hard, indeed to have found even one agricultural labourer with a family able to have paid even half the rent asked. The usual rents paid by the latter are 1/6, or , at in the most 2/- per week. As a result there are many houses in the ai strict on the unfit list, which must continue to be in habited, because or the lack of near and better buildings which could be rented at possible rents. OVER CROWDING:- There wore 7 cases in all reported during the year 1 in No.2. sub-District. 6 in No.l. sub-District. Of these latter cases two refer to the same family which was the cause cf overcrowding first at Ridgeway, then at Holwell, they finally settled in a house at Cloford where they have sufficient room. 2.

As regards the Mells Water Supply nothing definite has been done up to the end of the year. The new council houses are getting their supply from the old source. QUANTITY and QUALITY:- In spite of the severe and prolonged drought the supply has been sufficient; although, in October and November the Coleford supply was getting low, and the water had to be cut off between the hours of 6 p.m. and 6.a.m. to allow the reservoir to fill up. The only other supply that was affected was Wans trow, where a good deal of water was required for the milk Factory: and the supply had to be out off at night from June to the end of the year. The quality of the water in all public supplies has been good. WATER AND STREAMS:- Twelve samples Of drinking water from various wells and springs were examined by myself. In five cases the water was baa, and not 'it for use. The other sever, samples were good RIVERS AND STREAMS:- The only case of pollution was the stream at Norton St philip, polluted by whey from the Milk Factory. Since cheese malting hat- ceases here there has been no nuisance from this cause. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE:- The number of sewerage systems in the district remains the same as last year. The Nunney sewerage system was affected by the drought the river at Nunney being almost dry for some time. There was a complaint of a nuisance at Highbury caused by sewerage flowing over some land, and a Committee was appointed to investigate the matter. SANITARY INSPECT I OF DISTRICT.

Summary of examinations made:- for 110. Diphtheria 56 Tuberculosis 29 Typhoid (water) 2 Typhoid (widal) 1 Ringworm fungus 5 HATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE. This work is carried out in this District by the Public Health Department of the Middlesex County Council. Yous Medical Officer of Health being the Medical Officer of the two Infant Welfare Centres in this district. In considering the cases of deaths of infants under one year, one is struck by the foot that 10 of the infant deaths, or 45,4% are due to prematurity and congenital defeats. This is the highest percentage for a considerable number of years. It is difficult to account for this, as our experience at the Welfare Centres shows that the mothers take very good care of tham selves previous to the birth of their children. Dentition and convulsions were responsible for three deaths, half the total number of deaths of infants that occurred during 1920, No less than, five of the deaths were due to Diarrhoea and Enteritis. This disease is caused in the main by contaminated food, and then abnormally fine and hot summer was very favourable to the incidence of this disease. Another cause of this disease may be attributed to the absolute lack in a large number of working class houses of poper places for the storage of food. In a large number of instances food is stored in a dark and ill-ventilated cupboard and milk for the preparation of infants food kept in this condition it bound to give rise to intestinal disturbances and irritations leading to these diseases. These diseases too, prove rapidly fatal to infants, and skilled treatment is absolutely necessary. Often the child is seriously ill "before medical advice is sought and little can be done to prevent a fatal termination. During the year there was one death from Scarlet Fever in a child under one year. This is an extremely rare occurrence. An abnormal number of infants deaths together with a considerable decrease in the number of births has given us an infantile mortality rate considerably higher than the last two years. It is no less than 75 per thousand births, compared with .38 in 1920 and 42 in 1919. In this connection it is interesting to compare the mortality rate in infants under one year of age attending the Infant Welflare Centres with that in the District generally. During the year 222 infants under one year of age were attending the centres and there were six deaths, giving an infant mortality rate for the centres of 27 per thousand. Of these deaths one was from "wasting" from birth and hopeless from the beginning, one from CastroEnteritis and one from septic Scarlet Fever, the two latter dying in hospital. The Registrar-General give the infant mortality rate for England and Wales, as 83; Great Towns 87: Smaller Towns 84; and for London 80. I attach the tables and statistic a for the year, based on the scheme set out in the tables and blank forms formally issued by the Local Government Foard, together with the new particulars required by the Ministry and set out in the appendix of Circular 269. SAHITARY ADMINIDIRATION See Table 6. Number of Slaughterhouses - one licensed. This slaughter house is situated in the most closely built upon area in the District, but it is structurally very good and maintained in first class condition. It is about forty years old and for many years previous to the war was un-used. It was reregistered under the food control legislation and a license granted contrary to the advice of the Medical Officer of Health and Sanitary Inspector. However, after the license was granted, the whole place was replanned by your Sunitary Inspector and considerable alterations carried out to obtain (1) air use accommodation separute from the slaughter chamber, with independant ontrance, (Â£) Separate exit for meat, without passing it through lairage. (3) Blue briek chequered paring. (4) Tiled walla 6'6" high to slaughter chamber. (5) Improved light and ventilation. (6) An efficient winch and tackle (7) An improved water sunply. (8) Efficient drainage, (9) Sliding doors between lairage and slaughter chamber. (10) Artificial lighting by electricity. Unfortunately there is not sufficient room to provide a separate cooling chamber, and beef carcases have to bo retained in the slaughter chamber until they have set. They then guttered and removed to the various butchers' shops, The slaughterhouse in owned by one butcher, but satisfactory arrangements have boon made whereby any butcher in Extern Barnet may use the slaughter house, or any allotment holder may have his pig properly slaughtered by skilled men in a hygienic manner and there is no excuse for sluahgtering on unlicensed Premises in this District. The Sanitnry Inspector has made arrangements with the owner of the slaughterbouse to receive notice of any slaughtering contemplated outside the usual days of slaughtering and in no case is beef or park meat removed from the premises without proper inspection.
