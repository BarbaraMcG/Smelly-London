The General Purposes Committee were instructed to prepare an address expressing the Council's high appreciation of Councillor Hunt's services, and the following address was accordingly engrossed, framed, sealed with the common seal of the Council and presented to Councillor Hunt, at the Meeting of the Council on the 9th December, viz.:— 32 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF WANDSWORTH. Population, Area, Rateable Value, 254,327. 9,221 acres. £1,637,547. "To William Hunt, Esq., J.P., "We, the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan "Borough of Wandsworth, desire to convey to you our heartiest thanks "for the valuable services you have rendered to the Borough as Mayor, "from November, 1902, to November, 1903. "During your year of office there have been many Public Cere"monies in which you have officially taken part, notably in the opening "by Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales of the "system of Electric Tramways in South London, and in the reception "of Her Royal Highness Princess Christian at the Laying of the "Foundation Stone of St. Mary's Church, Summerstown. "During your Mayoralty an opportunity occurred of appealing to "the benevolence of the inhabitants of the Borough upon the destruction "by fire of the Royal Paper Mills at Wandsworth. Your prompt and "energetic action resulted in raising nearly £800 for the relief of the "workpeople who temporarily lost their means of livelihood by that "disaster. "We wish to record our high appreciation of the ability, courtesy, "and impartiality with which you have discharged the Duties of the "Chair and of the Magisterial Bench, and to recognise the graceful "services of the Mayoress in assisting you in many Social Functions "and in support of Local Institutions and movements for the public "benefit. "We trust that the Borough may long continue to receive the benefit "of your services as a Member of the Council." Presentation to the Mayoress. 8.—Councillor Lancaster, on behalf of the subscribers (Members of the Council) presented a brooch to Mrs. Hunt as a mark of appreciation of her services in the discharge of the duties of Mayoress during the past year. Bust of Queen 9.—A bust of Her Majesty the Queen was presented to the Council by Alderman J. M. Rucker on the 28th October. The bust is by the same sculptor (Mr. Sydney March) as the bust of the King which was presented to the Council by Councillor Lancaster. It has been placed on a pedestal in the Council Chamber on the left hand of the Mayor's Chair. 33 Rosewater Dishes. 10.—Alderman Rucker also presented to the Council two silver rose-water dishes with border of Arabesque designs in the Italian style, and panels of Medusa heads and Dolphins chased in low relief. In the centre treated in the same manner are the Arms of the Borough. The dishes bear the following inscription, "Metropolitan Borough of Wands"worth; Presented by Alderman Rucker, 1903." Mayors, Commemoration of. 11.—Councillor Buchanan presented to the Council a marble tablet for recording the names of the Mayors of the Borough, upon which had been inscribed the names of the first three Mayors. The tablet which has been erected in the ground floor corridor at the Council House was unveiled by the Mayor on the 14th October last. Church Services. 12.—Upon the invitation of the Lord Bishop of Rochester the Mayor, Aldermen, Councillors and principal officers of the Council attended in state with the Councils of other Metropolitan Boroughs in South London a service at the Collegiate Church of St. Saviour, Southwark, on Sunday the 10th January last. The Council and principal officers also attended in state services at the following churches in the Borough, viz.:— 21st Nov. 1903 Parish Church of Wandsworth, All Saints, High Street. 31st Jan 1904 Ditto Streatham, St. Leonard, Streatham High Road. 14th Feb. 1904 Ditto Clapham, Holy Trinity, Clapham Common. 10th April, 1904.

The Surrey (Princess of Wales) Imperial Yeomanry provided a riding escort for H.R.H. and the 4th Volunteer Battalion, East Surrey Regiment a Guard of Honour and a Band on the occasion. The Council also attended the consecration of the new church on the 30th April, 1904. Fire at McMurray's Royal Paper Mills. 15.—As stated in the last Annual Report a Fund was raised for the assistance of persons thrown out of employment by the fire at McMurray's Royal Paper Mills, Wandsworth, on January 17th, 1903. Relief was distributed weekly after careful enquiry into every case, partly in cash and partly in orders upon tradesmen, from the 30th January to the 23rd October last, and afforded most opportune assistance to those suddenly thrown out of employment. The following is a copy of the Balance-sheet issued by the Committee appointed to administer the Fund, viz.:— Receipts. £ s. d. Total amount of Subscriptions received 788 10 11 £788 10 11 Expenditure. £ s. d.

Lidiard, this Council's representative on the Metropolitan Water Board, having ceased to be a Member of the Council on the 1st November last ceased to be a Member of the Water Board on the 1st January following. The office was accordingly declared vacant by the Water Board and on the 27th January last Mr. Lidiard was unanimously re-appointed to fill the vacancy. 35 Streatham Charities. 17.—Article 30 of the Streatham Charities Scheme provides that out of the clear yearly income of the Dorothy Appleby Charity a yearly sum of £5 is to be applied by the Trustees in apprenticeships, and that the residue of the said income is to be applied in accordance with the existing trusts, provided that the local authority to whom any part of the said income is paid is to make such provision as will give to the parish of Streatham the benefit of such payment by way of reduction of the rates. The trusts provide for the residue of the income to be applied to and for the repair of the portion of the High Road between Streatham Church and Brixton. In December last the Trustees of the Streatham Charities passed the following resolutions on the subject of the provisions of this clause, viz.:— "Having regard to the fact (a) that the duty of repairing the roads in "the above-mentioned parish has devolved upon the Council of the "above-mentioned Borough, and "(b) that the expense of such repairs is "chargeable upon the rates of the Borough, and (c) that the amount pay"able to the Council out of the income of the said charities towards the "said expenses does not on an average exceed the sum of £200, which is "less than one-tenth of the amount raised by a rate of 1d. in the pound "in the above Parish, and (d) that it is practically impossible for the "Council as the local authority to comply with the direction contained "in Article 30 of the above-mentioned Scheme, viz.:—to make such "provisions as will give to the Parish of Streatham the benefit of such "payment by way of reduction of the rates on the Parish";— "(1) That it is most desirable that the trusts of the said Charities "of Dorothy Appleby and John Wilford be varied so that after applying "the yearly sum of £5 out of the clear yearly income of the Dorothy "Appleby Charity for apprenticing as in the said Article 30 is mentioned "the residue of the said income and the clear yearly income of the John "Wilford Charity shall cease to be applicable to the repair of the roads, "or to be payable to the local authority, but shall be applied by the "Trustees in manner directed by Article 31 of the Scheme." "(2) That the Charity Commissioners be requested to take such "steps by the application to Parliament or otherwise as may be neces"sary to enable the above resolution to be carried into effect and to vary "the said Trusts accordingly, and to make such modification in the said "scheme as they may deem expedient. "(3) That the Council of the Borough of Wandsworth be requested "to concur in the above or like resolution." 36 The Council concurred in the views contained in the resolutions and decided to support the application of the Trustees to the Charity Commissioners. The Charity Commissioners have since prepared a new draft scheme which proposes to add the following words to the Article 30, viz.:— "If and so long as a local authority, to whom on their making such "provision as aforesaid any income would be payable under this clause, "shall fail or refuse to make such provision, the income which but for "such failure or refusal would be payable to such local authority shall "be applied in the provision of pensions in addition to those hereinafter "prescribed and subject to similar conditions." The Council informed the Charity Commissioners that it did not object to the draft scheme and would take no action with respect to the portion of the charities applicable to the repair of Streatham High Road. Wandsworth Charities. 18.—Pursuant to section 2 of the Borough of Wandsworth (Wandsworth) Scheme Alderman Rucker, and Councillors Buchanan, Littlechild, Lorden, and Luscombe have been appointed by the Council Representative Trustees of the Wandsworth Consolidated Charities to fill vacancies caused by effluxion of time. Wandsworth Technical Institute. 19.—Councillors Luscombe and Robinson have been appointed by the Council Members of the Governing Body of the Wandsworth Technical Institute. Weir Hospital. 20.—The Council also re-appointed Alderman Dickinson and Councillors Penfold and Welton its representatives on the Committee to administer the Weir Trust. Wandsworth Town Hall. 21.—The London County Council having granted the licences for stage plays at the Town Hall and the Tooting Vestry Hall, subject to this Council undertaking to provide an iron or steel fire-resisting curtain to the stages there, the Council decided in view of the cost of complying with the County Council's requirement and of the few applications 37 received for the hire of the halls for stage plays, to abandon the stage play licences and to apply for a temporary licence should it be desired to use either of the halls for a dramatic performance. The Council decided to light and ventilate the Town Hall by electricity and a contract was entered into with the County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company, Ltd., for the installation for the sum of £350. The subject of the inconvenience and inadequate accommodation for the Rating Department has been considered and the room formerly used as a coroner's court has been fitted up as an office for the clerks, the room previously used as an office being set apart for the coroner's court and for use in connection with the letting of the hall. Registration Disrict. 22.—In order that the Registration Districts of Wandsworth and Croydon might be made co-extensive with the Poor Law Unions as altered by the Local Government Board Provisional Order referred to in the last report the Registrar-General obtained the sanction of the Local Government Board to the issue of an Order transferring the part of Tooting added to Mitcham from the Wandsworth Registration District to the Croydon Registration District and the part of Mitcham added to Tooting from the Croydon Registration District to the Wandsworth Registration District. Baths. 23.—The subject of the provision of Public Baths for the Eastern District has again been under the consideration of the Council and in February last it was decided that the present being an inopportune time for a large expenditure on the erection of Baths in the Borough, a set of Slipper or Spray Baths be provided on two or more suitable sites in the Eastern District. The Council subsequently decided to erect a bathhouse with 36 slipper baths on a site at the junction of Park Hill and Clapham Park Road, being part of the surplus land acquired for the road widening there. The number of baths to be provided is not to exceed 36. The subject of the conditions under which selected Architects are to be invited to submit competitive designs for the proposed building is under the consideration of the Baths and Wash-houses Committee. 33 Open air Swimming Bath. 24.—In January last the Council suggested to the London County Council that an open air swimming bath should be provided on Tooting Common. The Parks and Open Spaces Committee stated in reply that they were unable to do anything in the matter. This Council then presented a memorial to the London County Council pointing out the necessity for such a bath and suggested a suitable site on the Common. The subject is under the consideration of the County Council. Naxious Literature. 25.—The Conference on this subject referred to in the last report prepared some drafted bye-laws dealing with the matter which they suggested should be made by the London County Council. This Council approved of the byelaws which are at present under the consideration of the County Council. Adoptive Acts (Borrowing) Scheme. 26.—Doubts having arisen as to the application to the Metropolitan Borough Councils of the provisions as to borrowing for the purposes of the Adoptive Acts, the London Government Act Commissioners prepared a scheme declaring that the Council of a Metropolitan Borough in which or in any part of which any of the Adoptive Acts are in force shall have power to borrow for any purpose for which the Authorities mentioned in the Adoptive Acts as the Authorities to carry out those Acts into effect are authorised to borrow. The scheme was approved by the Privy Council. Rate Collection. 27.—Owing to the rapid growth of the Borough the Council found it necessary to re-arrange the Collecting Districts and two additional rate collectors were appointed, making 15 in all. Land Transfer Act. 28.—A joint petition was prepared by the Kensington Borough Council asking the House of Commons to direct on inquiry to be made by a Committee of that House into the result of the working of the compulsory provisions of the Land Transfer Act, 1897. The petition was sealed by this Council and by the Councils of 17 of the remaining 27 Metropolitan Boroughs and was presented to the House of Commons by Earl Percy on the 15th June, 1903. 39 Wandsworth and Clapham Union. 29.—The Inquiry into the suggested separation of the parish of Battersea from the Wandsworth and Clapham Union referred to in the last Annual Report was held by the Local Government Board Inspector, Mr. Lockwood, at the Municipal Buildings, Battersea, on the 1st, 22nd, and 23rd October last, Mr. Horace Avory, K.C., and Mr. H. C. S. Dumas represented this Council and Mr. Macmorran, K.C., and Mr. S. Mayer represented the Battersea Borough Council, who opposed the proposal. A large amount of statistical and other evidence was given at the Inquiry, in favour of and in opposition to the proposal. The reasons advanced by this Council for the separation are set out in the memorials to the Local Government Board printed in former Annual Reports. In November last a letter was received from the Local Government Board stating that after full consideration of the representations made at the Inquiry they had come to the conclusion that sufficient evidence had not been brought to justify the separation of Battersea from the Union at present; that the Board realised that, in view of the increasing population of Wandsworth, in the course of time a division of the Union would be necessary, but that so far as they could see, this was not likely to be the case for some 8 or 10 years to come and that when the time arrived they would be prepared to re-consider the matter; that in the meanwhile, the Board desired to impress upon the Guardians the need for proceeding as quickly as possible with the provision of the additional indoor accommodation which was urgently required, and that in selecting sites for the necessary buildings regard should be had to the probable division of the Union in the future. Royal Patriotic Asylum. 30.—The appeal of the Royal Patriotic Fund Commissioners against the rating of the Royal Victoria Patriotic Asylum was decided by a Divisional Court consisting of the Lord Chief Justice of England (Lord Alverstone), Mr. Justice Wills and Mr. Justice Channell, on the 25th May, 1903. The appeal had been pending since June, 1899, having been lodged by the Commissioners against a rate made in April, 1899. The Commissioners claimed that the Asylum was used exclusively or mainly for the purposes of the school rooms, offices, or playground of a Voluntary school and was therefore exempt from rating 40 by virtue of the Voluntary Schools Act, 1897. The overseers and their successors, the Council, while willing to make liberal allowances, having regard to the charitable nature of the Institution, could not agree to its total exemption from rating, and contended that the main object of the Institution was to form a home for the children. The Court held that the Patriotic Commissioners had failed to make out their case and judgment was given for the Council, with costs. Rastell Avenue Paving. 31.—In July, 1901, the Council decided to pave Rastell Avenue upon which a portion of Tooting Bee Common abuts at the cost of the owners of property abutting thereon and (following the decision in the case of "Fulham Vestry v. Minter") a charge of £319: 9: 9 was made upon the London County Council in respect of the Common. The County Council disputed their liability and a summons was issued against them and an order for payment made by the magistrate in December, 1901. The County Council appealed against the order of the Magistrate and the appeal was heard in the Divisional Court (the Lord Chief Justice: Darling and Channell, J.J.) on the 23rd April, 1902, when the order of the magistrate was upheld. Against this decision the County Council appealed. The appeal was heard on the 31st March. 1903, by Williams, Stirling, and Mathew, L.J.J., and judgment was given in favour of the County Council. As the matter was an important one and affected local authorities generally the Council asked the other Metropolitan Borough Councils whether in the event of this Council appealing to the House of Lords they would be willing to contribute towards the cost thereof. None of the Borough Councils being willing to contribute the appeal was not proceeded with. The apportionment made in July, 1901, was accordingly revoked and a fresh apportionment made in July, 1903, under which the whole cost of paving the road was charged upon the owners of the remaining houses and land abutting upon Rastell Avenue. In view of the burden cast upon the owners of houses and premises upon which parks or open spaces held for the recreation of the public also abut, as decided in the case of Rastell Avenue, the Council passed the following resolution on the subject, viz.:— 41 "That where any 'New Street,' which is within the provisions of "the Metropolis Management Acts relating to the paving of new streets "or any part of such street abuts on one side on any open space "dedicated to or held for the recreation or benefit of the public, a fair "proportion of the cost of the first paving of such street or part of a "street ought to be charged against the said open space and be borne "by the body or persons answerable for the maintenance of such open "space in the same manner and to the same extent as if such open space "was land belonging to a private owner, and that the London County "Council be requested to take such steps as may be proper for giving "Parliamentary sanction to the above stated principle." The County Council was asked to give the matter its consideration with a view to the necessary steps being taken to carry out the views contained in the foregoing resolution, and the other Metropolitan Borough Councils were asked to support the action of this Council. Paving Charges. 32.—This Council again had under consideration the subject of the charges made under apportionments of the cost of paving new streets under the provisions of the Metropolis Management Acts. As stated in the report for the vear ended March. 1902, places of worship belonging to the Established Church are exempt from such charges whilst Nonconformist places of worship are not so exempt. Numerous representations have been made from time to time by Trustees of Nonconformist places of worship as to the hardship which they suffer in this respect. Under the provisions of section 151 of the Public Health Act, 1875, and section 16 of the Private Streets Works Act, 1892 (which do not apply to London), the Incumbent, Minister, or Trustee of any church, chapel, or place appropriated to public worship is exempt from these charges and the charge in respect thereof is borne by the local authority. This Council being of opinion that the law in respect of these charges in the Metropolis should be assimilated to that for the provinces, passed the following resolution, viz.:— "That where any 'New Street,' which is within the provisions of "the Metropolis Management Acts relating to the paving of new streets, "or any part of such streets, abuts on one side on a church of any "denomination used exclusively for religious purposes, a fair proportion "of the cost of the first paving of such street or part of a street ought to "be charged against the General Rates of the Borough, and that the "London County Council be requested to take such steps as may be "proper forgiving Parliamentary sanction to the above-stated principle." 42 A copy of this resolution was forwarded to each of the other Metropolitan Borough Councils with a request that if they concurred with the views of this Council on the subject they would support the application of this Council. Sixteen of the Borough Councils concurred in the views of this Council and three were of opinion that no place of worship of any denomination should be exempt from liability to pay a proportion of the cost of paving a new street upon which it abuts. The County Council has since asked the Local Government Board to obtain such an amendment of the law as will secure uniformity of treatment in the case of all churches, chapels, or other buildings used exclusively and irrevocably for purposes of religious worship. Combined Drainage. 33.—The deputation appointed by the Conference convened by the Battersea Borough Council on this subject waited upon Mr. Long, the President of the Local Government Board on Thursday, the 18th June, 1903. The deputation was introduced by Sir A. K. Rollit, M.P., and the Mayor, Mr. P. M. Thornton, M.P., and the Town Clerk represented this Borough. Mr. Long stated that he recognised the existence of a very serious difficulty and thought it could only be remedied by the intervention of the Government; that he fully accepted the situation and would give to the solution of the matter his most careful and earnest consideration. Association of Metropolitan Borough Councils. 34.—The Mayor (Councillor Lorden, J.P.), Alderman Anderson, and the Town Clerk have been appointed this Council's representatives upon the Association of Metropolitan Borough Councils. The objects of the Association are, "inter alia" to discuss in conference questions of London Government, to exchange opinions thereon, and to advise and assist the Members of the Association in the administration of their powers and duties. Electric Lighting. 35.—The scheme for the supply of electric current generated by power obtained from the Tooting Dust Destructor referred to in the last report has been prepared by Mr. W. P. Adams and is at present under the consideration of the Council. 43 London Traffic. 36.—A Royal Commission having been appointed to enquire into the means of locomotion and transport in London a Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils was convened by the London County Council on the subject of the evidence to be given before the Commission. The following resolutions were passed at the Conference, viz.:— (1.) That evidence be placed before the Royal Commission on behalf of the councils of metropolitan boroughs dealing with the following matters— (a) Powers of regulating the unloading of barrels and coal over public footpaths in mam thoroughfares; each borough council to have power to fix the hours for such unloading in its own district. (b) Obstruction of streets due to street markets. (c) Removal of costermongers and other obstructions from main roads. (d) Breaking-up of streets by various statutory companies. (e) Charges to be made on persons liable for repairs to roads due to extraordinary traffic. (f) Charges due to diversion of traffic from main roads into side streets. (g) The provision of secondary streets for the relief of traffic. (2.) That in the opinion of this conference it is desirable that the statutory powers now possessed by the borough councils over public highways should not be curtailed. (3.) That in the opinion of this conference the existing difficulties with regard to locomotion and transport in London above ground would be largely remedied, if not entirely removed, by judicious street widenings and improvements. (4.) That the question of a service of passenger steamboats on the Thames should be included in the subjects to be considered by the Royal Commission, and that this conference do submit evidence upon the subject of such service of steamboats. (5.) That this conference is of opinion that the Royal Commission should take into consideration the desirability of extending the London cab radius. (6.) That this conference is of opinion that evidence should be given before the Royal Commission as to the interference with traffic caused by the opening of swing bridges in the neighbourhood of docks. 44 (7.) That the London County Council be asked to forward to the Royal Commission a copy of the resolutions passed by the conference on 24th June and 8th July, 1903. (8.) That the resolutions be also forwarded to borough councils with a view to each of the borough councils initiating the several proposals preparing and placing evidence before the Royal Commission with regard thereto on behalf of the borough councils supporting the respective proposals. The following list shows the various borough councils initiating proposals contained in resolutions set out above, and also, so far as was shown by letters addressed to the London County Council, the borough councils supporting the proposals— Number of Resolution. Initiating Borough Councils. Borough Councils supporting. 1 (a) Battersea Southwark, Fulham, Wandsworth, Bermondsey. 1 (b) Battersea Stoke Newington, Wandsworth, Bermondsey. 1 (c) Southwark Fulham, Wandsworth, Bermondsey. 1 (d) Battersea Wandsworth, Paddington, Bermondsey. 1 (e) Woolwich Battersea, Wandsworth, Bermondsey. 1 (f) Woolwich Battersea, Wandsworth, Bermondsey. 1 (g) Southwark Wandsworth, Bermondsey. 2 Southwark Wandsworth, Bermondsey. 3 Shoreditch Wandsworth, Bermondsey. 4 Greenwich Battersea, Fulham. 5 Wandsworth 6 Stepney Bermondsey. The Council informed the Commission that it approved of evidence being placed before the Commission with reference to the matters referred to in Resolutions Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 5. 37.—The Council also suggested— (1.) That the Tube railway should be continued,— (a) From Clapham to Tooting. (b) From Clapham Common to Clapham Junction, East Hill, and Southfields. (c) From Kennington through Brixton to Streatham Common. (2.) That direct communication is greatly needed between the neighbourhood of Clapham Junction and the northern district of London. 45 (3.) That tramways should be constructed as follows, viz.:— (a) From Clapham viâ Battersea Rise and East Hill to the western boundary of the Borough. (b) From Streatham viâ Tooting Bec Common and Trinity Road to East Hill, Wandsworth (c) From High Street, Putney, viâ Putney Bridge Road to High Street, Wandsworth. (4.) That a loop be formed between the London & South-Western Railway and the London, Brighton, & South Coast Railway, and that a quick and frequent service of trains should be run from Waterloo viâ Clapham Junction, Wandsworth East Putney, Southfields, Wimbledon, Merton, Tooting Junction, Streatham, Tulse Hill, Ludgate Hill, or London Bridge, or branching off from Tooting Junction to Balham, Wandsworth Common, Clapham Junction, and Victoria. (5.) That all local schemes relating to the conveyance of passenger traffic should be referred to a Central Authority, so as to maintain a continuity of the systems to the centre of London and other districts, and also avoid overlapping; 38.—The Town Clerk was instructed to give evidence before the Royal Commission in support of the views of the Council above-mentioned and also to give evidence against the suggested abolition of veto of local authorities with respect to tramway schemes and the proposal that the London County Council should regulate and undertake the repair of trenches opened by gas and water companies; in favour of the power to make byelaws regulating street traffic being retained by the Police, and of Borough Councils being consulted thereon; in favour of the proposed tribunal which it was suggested should be established to consider all schemes of railway or tramway construction being appointed by the Government; in favour of gas and other companies being required to give longer notice of their intention to open streets for purposes connected with their undertakings and of Borough Councils being authorised to regulate the depth at which the pipes and other works of the Companies should be laid; and upon such other matters brought before the Commission as might affect the Council. 39.—The Town Clerk accordingly attended before the Commission on the 6th September and gave evidence in accordance with the instructions of the Council. 46 Workmen's Trains. 40.—In April, 1903, the Council considered resolutions passed at Southfields, Wandsworth, calling attention to the excessive fares charged to workmen from Wimbledon, Wimbledon Park, Southfields, and East Putney Stations on the London and South-Western and Metropolitan District Companies railways, and to the inadequate service of workmen's trains. The attention of the Railway Companies in question was called to the matter and in June, 1903, a letter was received from the District Company stating that the subject had been under the consideration of the London and South-Western Railway Company and themselves and that it had been agreed to reduce the workmen's fares between Southfields and Putney and Sloane Square and the District Company's Stations west thereof and to run additional trains. The subject of the fares and service of trains from the stations in question is still under the consideration of the Council. Main Roads. 41.—In November last an Inquiry was held by Colonel Slacke into applications which had been made to the Local Government Board by certain Metropolitan Councils to determine the amount of the contribution (if any) which should be made by the London County Council in respect of the maintenance of certain roads winch prior to the coming into operation of the London Government Act were main roads. This Council was represented at the Inquiry by the Town Clerk who supported the view that the cost of maintaining the roads referred to should be borne by the respective Councils of the Boroughs in which they were situate, and pointed out that in the year 1867 the predecessors of the Council had had thrown upon them without any consideration the burden of maintaining a length of 13 miles of roads in the district of the Board of Works which had previously been maintained by Turnpike Trusts. Several other Metropolitan Borough Councils were represented at the Inquiry and opposed the payment of any contribution. The Local Government Board has not at present made any order in the matter. Streatham Common Station. 42.—The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company having declined to provide the accommodation at their new station at Streatham Common asked for by the residents in the locality, referred to in the last report, the 47 Council asked the City and South London Railway Company to extend their railway from Kennington through Brixton to Streatham Common. The Company stated in reply that they had no intention at present of seeking powers to extend the railway in the direction suggested, the competition of the tramways having such a serious effect on the traffic that the Directors were discouraged from embarking on further developments other than those for which they had Parliamentary powers. Paving New Streets. 43.—At the end of 1902 and the beginning of 1903 one of the Council's Sub-Committees came to the conclusion that the work of paving new streets in the Eastern District of the Borough had not been satisfactorily carried out and a Joint Sub-Committee of the New Streets and Highways Committees was appointed to consider the subject of the duties of the officers and servants and of the administration of the Surveyor's Department for that District. The Committee held 7 Meetings, examined such of the indoor and outdoor officers and servants as they considered necessary, and decided to recommend that several of them should be requested to resign. The recommendation was adopted by the Council. Subsequently the New Streets Committee reported to the effect that they had had openings made in certain streets and that some of the work was unsatisfactory. This report was referred to the consideration of the Joint SubCommittee and the subject of taking proceedings against the contractors in respect of defective work was referred to the General Purposes Committee. 44.—A writ having been issued by the contractors to recover the balance under their contract an expert was retained by the Council to examine the work carried out by the contractors and several roads were opened up and examined by him in the presence of the Joint Sub-Committee and of the contractors. After full consideration of the several reports on the subject the General Purposes Committee recommended the Council to settle the action commenced by Messrs. Lawrence & Thacker by paying their account and costs. This recommendation was adopted. 48 Streets Shouting. 45.—Complaints having been made of annoyance caused by street hawkers shouting their wares on Sundays the Council in November last made the following byelaw on the subject, viz.:— "No person shall, for the purpose of hawking, selling or advertising "any goods, call or shout in any street on Sundays so as to cause "annoyance to the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. Penalty—Any "person who shall offend against the foregoing Bye-law shall be liable "for every such offence, to a fine of not exceeding forty shillings." Gas Testing. 46.—Under the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Act, 1900, the Council are authorised to provide and maintain two places, one at Wandsworth and the other at Putney, and the Company are to provide, erect, and maintain at such places apparatus for testing the purity and illuminating power of the gas supplied by the Company. The Council set apart a portion of the late Putney Parish Offices for this purpose and the Company having provided the necessary apparatus the Council has made arrangements for daily tests to be made at the new testing place of the illuminating power and purity of the gas supplied by the Company. The earlier examinations under the new arrangement showed an excess of sulphur beyond the limits prescribed by the Act. The attention of the Company having been called to the matter, they stated in reply that at the time the Act was passed the purifiers were under re-arrangement with additions on a large scale, and that the work of reconstruction was not quite complete, but that the new purifiers would be in full operation by the third week in December. The subsequent daily tests showed that, except on four days in January when an accident happened at the works, the statutory limit had not been exceeded since. Supply of Gas. 47.—The Board of Trade having appointed a Committee to inquire as to the statutory requirements relating to the illuminating power and purity of gas supplied by Metropolitan Gas Companies, and as to the methods now adopted for testing the same, this Council informed the Board of Trade that three of the Companies which supply gas in this Borough are not subject to the provisions of the Metropolitan Gas Acts and suggested that such provisions should extend and apply 49 to all Companies supplying gas within the Metropolis. The Board of Trade stated in reply that they could not then enlarge the terms of reference to the Committee, and that when the Committee had reported it would be for Parliament to decide whether its recommendations should be extended to Companies not subject to the provisions of the Metropolis Gas Acts. Fair Wages Clauses. 48.—The Council decided to insert in its contracts in future the following clause, viz.:— "The Contractor shall, in the case of all workmen employed by him, "pay wages at not less, and observe hours of labour not greater, than "the rates and hours recognised by the Associations of Employers and "Employees and in practice obtained in the district where the work is to "be executed." Parliamentary Bills. 49.—The following Parliamentary Bills have been considered by the Council during the year, viz.:— London County Council Tramways and Improvements. London County Council (General Powers). London (Education). Thames River Steamboat Service. Polling Districts (County Councils). Polling Arrangements (Parliamentary Boroughs). Education Board Provisional Order Confirmation (London). Railways Electrical Power. Electric Lighting (London). Franchise and Removal of Women's Disabilities. Public Health.

Local Authorities Officers' Superannuation. Local Authorities (Qualification of Women). 50 Local Government Franchise & Representation (Extension to Companies.) Local Government (Transfer of Powers). Lunacy Acts (Amendment). Merchandise Marks. Shops (Early Closing). Thames Steamboat Trust. London County Council Tramways and Improvements. 50.—In June last the County Council again brought forward the proposal for the construction of tramways (a) from Clapham Common to East Hill and (b) from the present terminus at Streatham to the county boundary at Norbury. The latter scheme provided for the up-line of tramway being placed in the main road and for the down-line being laid along Gleneldon Road, Bournevale Road and Stanthorpe Road. This Council was asked to contribute one-third of the nett cost of the necessary street widenings in each case. With regard to the Clapham to East Hill line, the total estimated nett cost of which was £21,800, the attention of the County Council was called to the letter from that Council of February, 1902, in which this Council was asked whether it was prepared to consent to the proposed scheme, subject to the Borough being relieved from the obligation to contribute towards the cost of the widenings, and to this Council's consent thereto on the 25 th February, 1902; and the County Council was informed that this Council was prepared to give its consent upon similar terms. The County Council were also informed that this Council regretted that it was not apparently intended to apply for powers in the ensuing session for the extension of the tramway from Clapham to the County boundary at Kingston. The estimated cost of the widenings for the proposed line at Streatham was £95,500. This Council objected to the proposal to take one of the lines along side streets, and expressed the opinion that the scheme proposed in 1902 for a double line along Streatham High Road and the widening of that thoroughfare to 60 feet should be adhered to, and that as the widenings would be rendered necessary solely by the construction of the proposed tramway the Borough Council should not be called upon to contribute towards the cost. 51.—Further letters were received from the County Council in October last asking this Council to consent to the proposed tramways and to contribute one-third of the cost of the street 51 widenings and in November the County Council deposited a Parliamentary plan shewing the following proposed tramways and street widenings, viz.:— (a) Tramway No. 7 (double line, 2 miles 4.25 chains in length) from East Hill, Wandsworth, at a point 1½ chains east of Geraldine Road, passing along East Hill, Wandsworth Common North Side, Battersea Rise, and Clapham Common North Side to Clapham Common South Side terminating by a junction with the existing tramway there at a point three chains north-east of The Grove. (b) Tramway No. 8 (double line, 1 furlong 3.10 chains in length) from the existing tramway in Streatham High Road opposite the Tate Public Library, passing along Streatham High Road and terminating one chain north of Gleneldon Road. (c) Tramway No. 8a (single line, 2 furlongs 0.25 chains in length) mencing by a junction with the proposed tramway No. 8, passing along Gleneldon Road, Bournevale Road, and Stanthorpe Road, and terminating in Streatham High Road by a junction with the proposed tramway No. 8e. (d) Tramway No. 8b (single line, 1 furlong 2.5 chains in length) commencing in Streatham High Road by a junction with proposed tramway No. 8, passing along Streatham High Road and terminating in that road by a junction with the proposed tramway No. 8c. (e) Tramway No. 8c (double line, 1 mile 2 chains in length) commencing in Streatham High Road by a junction with the proposed tramways Nos. 8a and 8b at a point half a chain south of Stanthorpe Road, passing along Streatham High Road to the county boundary at Norbury. (f) Widenings at East Hill and North Side. (g) Widenings at Streatham High Road, Sunnyhill Road, Gleneldon Road, Bournevale Road, and Stanthorpe Road. (h) Empowering the London County Council to alter level of Streatham High Road at the London Brighton, and South Coast Railway bridge. (i) Empowering the London County Council to acquire by compulsion or agreement land in Jews' Row, Wandsworth and to erect car sheds, etc., thereon. (k) Empowering the London County Council to use a strip of land forming part of Wandsworth Common for widening Wandsworth Common North Side. 52 52.—After consideration this Council with reference to the Clapham to East Hill line informed the County Council that this Council would be disposed to give its consent to the present proposal and to contribute one-sixth of the cost of the proposed widenings (such contribution not to exceed £3,633), subject to the following conditions, viz,:— (1) That the consent shall not apply to the provisions of the Bill, nor operate to preclude the Council from objecting thereto or presenting a petition against the same and in support of the insertion of other provisions and appearing upon such petition. (2) That so much of the road along which the proposed tramway is to be laid as is within the Borough of Wandsworth be widened before the tramway is constructed to not less than fifty-four feet by the London County Council. 53.—With regard to the proposed line at Streatham the County Council was informed that this Council objected to the proposal to take one of the lines along side streets so as to avoid widening the steep and narrow part of Streatham High Road between Gleneldon Road and Gleneagle Road, and without prejudice to the locus standi of this Council in opposition to the scheme was of opinion that the scheme proposed by the County Council last year for a double line of tramways along Streatham High Road and the widening of that thoroughfare to 60 feet in connection therewith should be adhered to, and was willing to contribute one-sixth of the cost of the street widenings,—such contribution not to exceed £32,500. 54.—Formal consent was given to the introduction of the Bill so far as it related to the proposed tramway from Clapham to East Hill upon an undertaking being given on behalf of the County Council to strike the tramway out of the Bill at a later stage if required by this Council to do so. The County Council subsequently stated that as this Council was not prepared to contribute one-third of the cost of the widenings the Countv Council did not feel justified in proceeding further with its application to Parliament. The Countv Council was thereupon asked to receive a deputation from this Council with the view of the Clapham to Wandsworth tramway being proceeded with and also to discuss 53 the Streatham scheme and in the meantime not to withdraw those tramways from the Bill. The County Council stated in reply that the Standing Order not having been complied with in the case of the Streatham line and in the case of the Clapham Common line the County Council having passed a resolution not to proceed petitioners against the Bill had withdrawn their opposition, and that it was not practicable to proceed with the schemes that Session. 55.—On the 9th June a deputation from this Council had an interview with the Highways Committee of the County Council to discuss the question of the two proposed tramways above referred to and the general question of this Council's contribution towards the cost of street widenings in connection with tramway widenings, and a letter has since been received stating that the Highways Committee do not see their way to recommend the County Council to submit the schemes to Parliament in the Session of 1905 but are considering them in connection with any schemes which may be placed before the County Council for the Session of 1906. London County Council (General Powers). 56.—This Bill would, amongst other things, authorise Sanitary Authorities to cause articles of clothing or of any other nature in a filthy, dangerous, or unwholesome condition to be cleansed or destroyed; to require the owner or occupier of any house or part of a house which appeared to them to be infested with vermin to cleanse the same; to require the owner to remove any sanitary convenience accessible from any street which in the opinion of the Sanitary Authority shall be so placed or constructed as to be a nuisance or offensive to public decency, provided that this provision shall not extend to any sanitary convenience erected by any railway company within their railway stations, yards, or approaches thereto; to require the removal of fixed ash-pits in all cases where a movable ash-pit has been provided. The Bill would also prohibit the sorting or sifting of house refuse in the County of London otherwise than by machinery or mechanical means; and provided that with respect to any room or place in which any article intended or adapted for the sale of food is sold, exposed for sale, or prepared for sale, no sanitary convenience shall 54 be within or directly communicate with such room or place; that every cistern for supplying water shall be separate and distinct from any cistern supplying water to a sanitary convenience; that no drain for carrying off fœcal or sewage matter shall have any inlet or opening within such room or place; that no such room or place shall be used as a sleeping place nor communicate directly with a sleeping place, and that nothing shall be done which is likely to expose such article to infection or contamination; would empower the County Council to make and amend bye-laws with respect to the paving and drainage of stables and yards; authorise Sanitary Authorities or their officers to enter premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of examining whether there is any contravention of the provisions of clauses of the Bill or the byelaws made thereunder; authorise the County Council to cause cows suffering from tuberculosis of the udder to be slaughtered and to pay the owner compensation therefor; empower the County Council and the owners of the Mortimer estate to enter into an agreement for the exchange of certain land now forming part of Tooting Common for certain land forming part of the Mortimer estate; authorise the County Council to provide, cook, and sell to the occupants for the time being of any dwelling accommodation or lodging house for the working classes provided or managed by that Council food of every description except intoxicating liquors, and also to provide and sell tobacco and other articles necessary and convenient for the use of such occupants; empower Borough Councils to plant trees in any highway in their Borough and enable such Councils to support or contribute to the support of public walks or pleasure grounds in their Borough provided by any person whomsoever. The last-mentioned provision was withdrawn by the County Council with the view of steps being taken to extend to Borough Councils the provisions of section 12 of the Open Spaces Act, 1887, which authorises the County Council to purchase, or lease, lay out, plant, improve, and maintain lands for the purpose of being used as public walks or pleasure grounds and to support or contribute to the support of public walks or pleasure grounds provided by any person whomsoever. 57.—This Council approved of the Bill, subject to the following words being added at the end of clause 49, viz.:—"This 55 provision to apply only to houses of the Rowton House type." In reply to this suggestion the County Council stated that it was never the intention that the clause should apply to houses other than lodging houses of the Rowton House type and that it was proposed to amend the clause in question to make that clear. The Bill with amendments received the Royal assent on the 15th August. Education (London). 58.—This Bill, as introduced, provided that as ordinarily constituted the Education Committee was to consist of 92 Members of which 36 were to be Members of the County Council appointed by that Authority, 31 Members of and appointed by the Metropolitan Borough Councils (2 by the Common Council, 2 by the City of Westminster, and 1 by each of the Borough Councils) and 25 appointed by the London County Council in accordance with a scheme to be approved by the Board of Education; and that the Borough Councils were to be the Managers of all provided elementary schools in their respective Boroughs, and were, subject to any general directions given by the County Council and to the power of the Council to determine the number, qualifications and salaries of teachers, to exercise the powers and duties of management as respects those schools (including the power of appointing and dismissing teachers and the custody of the buildings). This Council approved of these proposals. In May the Government proposed to make certain amendments in the provisions of the Bill relating to the constitution of the Education Committee by which there would have been only 12 Members representing the Borough Councils, and also in the provisions relating to the management of schools. The Government were informed that this Council were strongly of opinion that the original provisions in the Bill with regard to the constitution of the Committee should be retained so that each Borough Council should be separately represented, and that such Councils should have statutory powers for the management of all provided elementary and secondary schools. The following resolutions were also passed at a Conference of representatives of the Cities of London and Westminster and the Metropolitan Borough Councils convened by the Corporation of London which Aldermen Anderson and Dryden and Councillor Keeling attended as this Council's representatives, viz.:— 56 "That in the opinion of this Conference no Bill can be regarded as "satisfactory to the Cities and Boroughs of the County of London which "does not provide for large representation of the Borough Councils on "the Education Committee." "That this Conference while deploring that the Government have "deleted from the Bill the proposed representation of the Borough "Councils upon the Education Committee would yet urge upon the "Government that there should at least be delegated to the Borough "Councils larger powers of administration." 59.—Eventually the Government withdrew from the Bill the provisions relating to the representation of Borough Councils upon the Education Committee and the Bill after amendment was passed and received the Royal Assent on the 14th August last. 60.—The following report on the Act was laid before the Council by the Town Clerk, viz.:— EDUCATION (LONDON) ACT, 1903. Under this Act Metropolitan Borough Councils have powers relating to the following matters, viz.:— 1.—Appointment of Managers and the grouping of Public Elementary Schools provided by the Local Education Authority (sec. 2)* 2.—Sites of new Public Elementary Schools (sec. 2). 3.—Appointment of a Manager in respect of each Public Elementary School not provided by the Local Education Authority (sec. 6 of Education Act, 1902).* 4.—Arrangements between Councils for the exercise of any powers of an authority having powers under the Act in respect of the management of any school or college within the exercise of the Council (sec. 20 of Act of 1902). Section 1 applies the Education Act, 1902, subject to the provisions of this Act, to London. Section 2 provides that every public elementary school provided by the Local Education Authority (the London County Council) within the area of any Metropolitan Borough shall have a body of Managers; * There are 31 "provided" schools (exclusive of 4 special schools referred to in the concluding part of section 2 of the Act of 1903), and 33 " non-provided" schools in the Borough of Wandsworth. 57 that the number of those Managers and the manner in which schools shall be grouped under one body of Managers shall be determined by the Council of each Borough, after consultation with the Local Education Authority, and subject to the approval of the Board of Education. Two-thirds of every such body are to be appointed by the Borough Council, and one-third by the Local Education Authority. Due regard is to be had in selecting Managers to the inclusion of women in the proportion of not less than one-third of the whole body of Managers,—and in the case of the first body of Managers also of Members chosen from the then existing bodies of Managers. The Borough Council and the Local Education Authority are to carry out any directions given by the Board of Education for the purpose of giving effect to this provision. The site of any new public elementary school to be provided by the Local Education Authority is not to be determined upon until after consultation with the Borough Councils in whose area the proposed site is situated, and in the case of compulsory purchase if the Borough Council does not concur in the compulsory acquisition, the Board of Education are not to make the order authorising the purchase unless they are satisfied that the concurrence of the Borough Council should be dispensed with. Except in the case of compulsory acquisition, schools provided by the Local Education Authority for the blind, deaf, epileptic, and defective children, and any other schools which in the opinion of the Board of Education are not of a local character, are not to be treated for the purpose of this section as public elementary schools. Section 3 provides that any public elementary school provided by the London School Board before the passing of the Act which is wholly or partly situated outside the County of London shall be treated as, and for the purpose of the principal Act be deemed to be, situate in the nearest Metropolitan Borough, and any public elementary school provided by the Local Education Authority situated partly in one Borough and partly in another shall be deemed to be situate in such one of those Boroughs as the Local Education Authority determine. Section 5 provides that, except as expressly provided, the Act shall come into operation on the appointed day, and that the appointed day shall be the First of May, 1904, or such other day not being more than twelve months later as the Board of Education may appoint, and that different days may be appointed for different purposes and different provisions of the Act. The First Schedule modifies certain provisions of the Act of 1902. These modifications are made in the following abstract of that Act. The Second Schedule sets out the enactments repealed. The Education Act 1902, as modified for London by the Act of 1903, is to the following effect, viz.:— 58 PART I. Section 1.—The County Council is to be the Local Education Authority. Power to aid Higher Education. PART II.— HIGHER EDUCATION. Section 2.—The Local Education Authority are to consider the educational needs of their area and take such steps as they deem desirable, after consultation with the Board of Education, to supply or aid the supply of education other than elementary, and to promote the general co-ordination of all forms of education and for that purpose to apply all or so much as they deem necessary of the residue under Section I. of the Local Taxation Act, 1890, and to carry forward for the like purpose any balance thereof which may remain unexpended and may spend such further sums as they think fit. Religions Instruction. Section 4.—The County Council in the application of money under this Part of the Act shall not require that any particular form of religious instruction or worship or any religious catechism or formulary which is distinctive of any particular denomination shall or shall not be taught, used, or practised in any school, college, or hostel aided but not provided by the Council, and no pupil shall, on the ground of religious belief, be excluded from or placed in an inferior position in any school, college, or hostel provided by the Council, and no catechism or formulary distinctive of any particular religious denomination shall be taught in any school, college, or hostel so provided, except in cases where the Council at the request of the parents of scholars at such times and under such conditions as the Council think desirable allow any religious instruction to be given in the school, college, or hostel, otherwise than at the cost of the Council. No unfair preference is to be shown to any religious denomination. Powers and duties. PART III.— ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. Section 5.—The Local Education Authority have throughout their area all the powers and duties of a School Board and School Attendance Committee under the Elementary Education Acts, 1870-1900, and have control of all secular instruction in public elementary schools not provided by them. Management of Schools. Section 6.—All public elementary schools not provided by the Local Education Authority are to have in place of the existing Managers, a body of Managers consisting of a number of Foundation Managers not exceeding 4, together with 2 59 Managers.— I appointed by the Local Education Authority and 1 by the minor Local Authority (i.e., the Borough Council). Schools may be grouped under one body of Managers and where the Local Education Authority consider the circumstances of any school require a larger body of Managers than that provided in this section that Authority may increase the total number of Managers so however that the number in each class is proportionately increased. Maintenance or Schools. Section 7.—The Local Education Authority are to maintain and keep efficient all public elementary schools and have the control of all expenditure for that purpose other than expenditure for which provision is to be made by the Managers, but in the case of schools not provided by them only so long as:— (a) The Managers carry out the directions of the Local Education Authority as to secular instruction, the number and educational qualifications of the teachers, and for the dismissal of any teacher on educational grounds. If the Managers fail to carry out any such direction the Local Education Authority have power to themselves carry out the direction in question as if they were Managers, but no direction under this provision is to interfere with reasonable facilities for religious instruction during school hours. (b) The Local Education Authority have power to inspect the school. (c) The consent of the Local Education Authority is required to the appointment of teachers. The consent, however, is not to be withheld except on educational grounds. The consent of the Authority is also to be required to the dismissal of a teacher unless the dismissal be on grounds connected with the giving of religious instruction in the school. (d) The Managers provide the school house free of charge, except for the teachers' dwelling-house (if any) and keep the same in good repair and make such alterations and improvements in the buildings as may be reasonably required by the Local Educational Authority. Damage due to fair wear and tear is to be made good by the Education Authority. (e) The Managers allow the Local Education Authority to use any room in the school house out of school hours free of charge for any educational purposes on not more than 3 days in the week. 60 In a school maintained but not provided by the Local Education Authority the Managers, in respect of the use by them of school furniture out of school hours and the Local Education Authority in respect of the use by them of any room in the school out of school hours are to be liable for any damage by reason of that use (other than damage arising from fair wear and tear). Assistant and pupil teachers may be appointed without reference to religious creed and denomination, and in the event of there being more candidates for the post of pupil teacher than vacancies, the appointment is to be made by the Local Education Authority. Religious instruction given is to be in accordance with the provisions of the trust deed and be under the control of the Managers. The Managers are to have all powers of management and (subject to the provisions of this section) the exclusive power of appointing and dismissing teachers. Provision of new Schools. Section 8.—Where it is proposed to provide a new public elementary school public notice is to be given, and the Managers of any existing school or the Local Education Authority, or any ten ratepayers in the area for which it is proposed to provide the school, may within three months appeal to the Board of Education on the ground that the proposed school is not required or that another school is better suited to meet the wants of the district than the school proposed to be provided. Enlargements of a school may be treated by the Board of Education as the provision of a new school, and transfers of a school to or from the Local Education Authority are to be treated as the provision of a new school. Necessity of Schools. Section 9.—The Board of Education is to settle whether a school is necessary or not and in so determining is to have regard to the interest of secular instruction, the wishes of parents and the economy of the rates. A school shall not be considered unnecessary in which the number of scholars in average attendance is not less than 30. Aid Grants. Section 10.—In lieu of the grants under the Voluntary Schools Act, 1897, and the Elementary Education Acts, 1870 and 1897 there is to be paid out of monies provided by Parliament a sum equal to 4/- per scholar and an additional 1½d. per scholar for every complete 2d. per scholar by which the amount which would be produced by a penny rate falls short of 10/- per scholar. If in any year the total amount of parliamentary grants payable to the Local Education Authority would make the amount payable out of other sources by that authority on account of their expenses under this part of 61 the Act less than the amount which would be produced by a rate of 3d. in the £, the Parliamentary grants are to be decreased and the amount payable out of other sources increased by a sum equal in each case to half the difference. Foundation Managers. Section 11.—The Foundation Managers are to be Managers appointed under the provisions of the trust deed, but if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Board of Education that the provisions of the trust deed as to the appointment of Managers are in any respect inconsistent with the provisions of the Act or insufficient or inapplicable for the purpose or that there is no trust deed available, that Board are to make an order for the purpose of meeting the case. Grouping of Schools not provided by Local Authority. Section 12.—The Local Education Authority may with the consent of the Managers of the schools group under one body of Managers any public elementary schools not provided by them. The body of Managers of grouped schools is to consist of such number and be appointed in such manner and proportion as may be agreed upon between the Managers of the schools concerned and the Local Education Authority, or in default of agreement, may be determined by the Board of Education. The Local Education Authority are to make provision for the due representation of Borough Councils on these bodies. Endowments. Section 13.—Nothing in the Act is to affect any endowment or the discretion of any trustees in respect thereof. Provided that where the income must be applied for the purposes of a public elementary school for which provision is to be made by the Local Education Authority, the income is to be paid to that Authority, and in case part only of any income is to be so applied and there is no provision under the trusts or provisions for determining the amount which represents that part, the amount is to be determined in case of difference between the parties concerned by the Board of Education. The Board of Education may upon the application of the trustees of the endowment or the Local Education Authority direct that any money which would be payable under the section to the County Council shall be applied in the manner to be provided by a scheme made by that Board. In any such scheme due regard is primarily to be had to the interests of the locality for which the benefits of the endowment were intended. (Act of 1903, 1st sched. cl. 4.) Apportionment of School Fees Section 14.—Where fees have been charged in any school not provided by the Local Education Authority,. that authority shall, while they continue to allow fees to be charged in 62 respect of the school pay to the Managers such proportion of those fees as may be agreed upon, or, in default of agreement, determined by the Board of Education. Institution Schools. Section 15.—The Local Education Authority may, but shall not be required to, maintain any Marine School, or any school which is part of, or is held in the premises of any institution in which children are boarded. Enforcement of duties. Section 16.—Empowers the Board of Education after public inquiry to make such order as they think necessary for the purpose of compelling the Local Education Authority to fulfil any of their duties under the Elementary Education Acts, 1870 to 1900, and this Act. Education Committee. PART IV—GENERAL. Section 17.—The County Council are to establish an Education Committee or Committees constituted in accordance with a scheme made by the Council and approved by the Board of Education. All matters relating to the exercise of powers under the Act, except the power of raising a rate or borrowing money, are to stand referred to the Education Committee and the Council before exercising any such powers are, except in cases of urgency, to consider the report of the Education Committee with respect to the matter in question. The Council may also delegate to the Education Committee any of their powers under the Act, except the power of raising a rate or borrowing money. A person is disqualified from being a member of an Education Committee who by reason of holding an office or place of profit, or having any interest in a contract or employment, is disqualified from being a member of the Council appointing the Education Committee, but no such disqualification is to apply to a person by reason only of his holding office in a school or college aided, provided, or maintained by the Council. Expenses. Section 18.—The expenses of the County Council so far as not otherwise provided for are to be paid out of the County fund. All receipts in respect of any such school maintained by the Local Education Authority (excluding sums especially applicable for purposes for which provision is to be made by the Managers) are to be paid to that authority. Borrowing. Section 19.—The London County Council may borrow for the purpose of the Elementary Education Acts, 1870 to 1900, or this Act, as for the purposes of the Local Government Act, 1888. 63 Arrangements between Councils. Section 20.—An Authority having powers under the Act may make arrangements with the County Council or a Borough Council on such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon for the exercise of any powers of the authority in respect of the management of any school or college within the area of the Council. Schemes. Section 21 applies the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1875, which relate to provisional orders to any scheme for the constitution of the Education Committee. Elementary and Higher Education. Section 22.—The expression "elementary school" is not to include any school carried on as an evening school under the regulations of the Board of Education. The power to provide instruction under the Elementary Education Acts is, except where those Acts expressly provide to the contrary, to be limited to the provision in a public elementary school of instruction given under the regulations of the Board of Education to scholars who at the close of the school year will not be more than 16 years of age. But the Local Education Authority may, with the consent of the Board of Education, extend those limits in the case of any school if no suitable higher education is available within a reasonable distance of the school. Section 23 authorises the provision of vehicles or the payment of reasonable travelling expenses for teachers or children attending school or college, and empowers Councils to make provision for the purposes of supplying or aiding the supply of education other than elementary outside their area in cases where they consider it expedient to do so in the interests of their area, and to provide or assist in providing scholarships for and to pay the fees of students ordinarily residents in their area at schools, colleges, or hostels within or without that area. Teachers in a school maintained but not provided by the Local Education Authority are in the same position as respects disqualification for office as members of the Authority as teachers in a school provided by the Authority. [The Bill for the Act of 1903 as introduced into the House of Commons proposed to add the following words to this provision, viz.:—"and the office of a teacher in a "school provided by the Local Education Authority shall be "deemed to be an office in the gift or disposal of the County "Council and, as respects any school managed by the Council "of a Metropolitan Borough a paid office under the Council of "that Borough." These words were not however added to the provision.] 64 School serving more than one area. Section 24.—Where a school appears to the County Council to serve the area of more than one Borough Council the County Council is to make provision for the joint appointment of Managers by the Authorities concerned. Education Committee and Managers. First Schedule.— The County Council may make regulations as to the quorum, proceedings, and place of meeting of the Education Committee, but subject to such regulations the quorum, proceedings, and place of meeting are to be such as the Committee determine. Transfers and adjustments. Second Schedule.— The schedule contains other provisions as to the proceedings of Education Committees and Managers. Property, powers, rights, and liabilities, and the officers of the School Board are transferred to the County Council. The Schedule also contains the necessary transitory provisions. Third Schedule.— This schedule modifies certain provisions of the Elementary Education and other Acts. Fourth Schedule.— Sets out the enactments repealed. 61.—A Committee has been appointed to advise the Council on all matters relating to the Act, and the following Members have been appointed the Council's representatives on Committees of Managers of Non-provided schools in the Borough, viz.:— Church, National, and Parochial Schools. Alderman Bulcraig Clapham Parochial. Councillor Kent Christ Church, Union Grove, Clapham. Councillor Somerford Wandsworth Road Commercial. Alderman Dunkley St. James's, White Square, Clapham. Councillor Glegg St. Paul's, Heath Road. Alderman Rucker All Saints, Putney Bridge Road, Wandsworth. { All Saints, Putney Lower Common. { St. Mary, Charlwood Road, Putney. Councillor Lindsey { Upper Grade Boys, Putney. { Upper Grade Girls, Putney. Councillor Warter Christ Church, Christ Church Road, Streatham. Councillor Welton Holy Trinity, Tulse Hill. Councillor Penfold Holy Trinity, Trinity Road, Upper Tooting. Councillor Sommerfeld Immanuel, Streatham Common. Councillor Lance Roehampton Parochial. Alderman Hewett St. Andrew's Infants, Streatham Common. The Mayor St. Anne's, Wandsworth. Councillor Robinson St. Faith's, Wandsworth. Councillor Curtis St. Leonard, Mitcham Lane, and Wellfield Road, Streatham. Councillor Phillips St. Mary, Balham High Road. Councillor Bulstrode St. Michael, Merton Road, Wandsworth. 65 Roman Catholic Schools. Alderman Kipling St. Mary, Crescent Road and Park Place, Clapham. Councillor Aldridge Nightingale Square, Balham. Councillor Radford Convent of the Sacred Heart, Roehampton. Councillor Allen St. Andrew, Polworth Road, Streatham. Councillor Cresswell St. Joseph, and St. Thomas, Wandsworth. Alderman Anderson Tooting, Mitcham Road. 62.—The subject of the appointment of Managers and Grouping Provided Schools is under the consideration of the Council. Thames River Steamboat Service Bill. 63.—This was a Bill to authorise the County Council and the Conservators of the River Thames to enter into agreements for the transfer to the Council of any piers, landing places, &c., belonging to the Conservators, to enable the County Council to require the Greenwich Pier Company to sell their undertaking to the Council, and to empower the County Council to contract for, provide, purchase, or hire vessels and run a service of vessels for the conveyance of passengers and parcels on the river Thames between the eastern end of Chiswick Eyot and the eastern boundary of the parish of Plumstead, and for these purposes to spend on capital account a sum not exceeding £250,000. The Bill also provided for any deficiency of revenue being made good out of the County rates. This Council approved generally of the Bill, which passed both Houses and received the Royal Assent on the 15th August, 1904. Polling Districts (County Councils). 64.—The object of this Bill was to enable County Councils to exercise from time to time and as often as they think fit the power of dividing electoral divisions into polling districts for the purpose of Elections of County Councillors and to alter any such polling districts. This Council suggested that a clause to the effect of paragraph 12 in the Borough Councils Election Order, 1903, authorising the Returning Officer to determine the number and situation of polling stations should be inserted in the Bill. The suggestion, however, was not adopted. The Bill passed the House of Lords and was sent to the House of Commons on the 8th March last. 66 Polling Arrangements (Parliamentary Boroughs). 65.—This Bill proposed to transfer from the Justices to the County Council the power to divide Parliamentary Boroughs into polling districts. The County Council has already this power with regard to the polling districts for County Council Elections, and this Council being of opinion that the division into polling districts of Parliamentary Boroughs and County Council areas should be in the hands of one Authority, petitioned in favour of the Bill. The Bill was read a third time in the House of Lords and sent to the House of Commons on the 8th March last. Education Board Provisional Order Confirmation (London). 66.—This Bill contained provisions to empower the School Board for London to compulsorily acquire a site between High Street, Putney, and Stratford Grove for a Board school. The Council objected to the proposed site as being too near existing schools. The Bill received the Royal assent on the 11th August last, but no steps have been taken to acquire the property. Railways Electrical Power. 67.—This was a Bill to facilitate the introduction and use of Electrical power on railways and proposed to empower the Board of Trade to make orders authorising railway companies to use electricity in addition to or in substitution of any other motive power, to construct generating stations or other works on land belonging to them, and to subscribe to any electrical undertaking which would facilitate the supply of electricity to the Company, &c. This Council approved of the Bill, which received the Royal Assent on the 14th August last. Electric Lighting (London). 68.—This was a Bill to provide for the adjustment in accordance with the changes of boundary effected under the London Government Act of 1899 of the areas within which Local Authorities and Companies were authorised to supply electricity. This Council petitioned in favour of the Bill which passed. Fra nchise and Removal of Women's Disabilities. 69.—This Bill proposed to establish a single franchise at all elections and thereby to abolish University representation, and to remove the disabilities of women. The Council petitioned against the Bill, which was not proceeded with. 67 Public Health. 70.—This was a Bill to amend the law relating to the qualification and tenure of the office of Medical Officers of Health and Inspectors and to make further provisions relating to superannuation allowances for such Officers and Inspectors; and for other purposes. Clause 3 of the Bill would have removed Inspectors from the sole control of the authorities under whom they serve. The Council objected to this proposal and to other provisions in the Bill which in the opinion of the Council were unnecessary and inexpedient. A petition was accordingly presented against the Bill, which was not proceeded with. Housing of Working Classes. 71.—Four Bills on this subject were introduced during the last session. Upon the first three, viz.:—Housing of Working Classes (London), Housing of Working Classes (Repayment of Loans), and Housing of Working Classes, this Council made no order, but asked the Home Secretary to insert in the Bill which it was understood the Government intended to introduce, provisions enabling local authorities in connection with the schemes under Part III. of the Act of 1890 to erect (subject to the approval of a Government Department) upon land acquired for the purposes of the Act and abutting upon any road or thoroughfare, houses, shops, and places of business not being working class dwellings, and to sell or let on lease or otherwise such houses, shops, and places of business with a view to increasing the income or re-couping the capital expenditure in respect of such schemes. The three Bills above-mentioned were dropped after the first reading, and the Government Bill (Housing of the Working Classes No. 2) was subsequently introduced and contained a clause to the effect suggested by this Council, as well as provisions to extend the period of repayment of loans to 80 years, to authorise the transfer of powers from the Home Office to the Local Government Board, and to amend the procedure under the Acts. The Council approved of the Bill, which received the Royal Assent on the 14th August, 1903. Port of London. 72.—This Bill proposed to establish a Commission for the administration of the Port of London and for transferring to the Commission the undertakings of certain Dock Companies and certain powers and duties of the 68 Conservators of the River Thames and the Watermen's Company. The Bill provided that the Commission should consist of a Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and Commissioners appointed or elected as follows:—By the London County Council, 8; Common Council of the City, 2; the Admiralty, 1; the Board of Trade, 1; Trinity House, 1; Railway Company's Association, 1; Payers of Dues on Ships, 1; Traders, 10; Wharfingers, 4; Owners of River Craft, 2. This Council were of opinion that the respective Councils of the Metropolitan Boroughs abutting upon the River Thames which have a special interest in the river traffic should be represented on the proposed Commission. A petition asking that the Bill might be amended in this respect was presented to the House of Commons. The Bill was referred to the Joint Committee and on the 12th August, 1903, proceedings were suspended until this Session. The Bill was eventually withdrawn on the 8th August, 1904. Metropolitan Streets. 73.—This was a Bill to empower the police to make regulations with respect to the places where and the conditions under which persons may collect money in streets for charities or other purposes. The Council approved of the Bill which received the Royal Assent on the nth August, 1903. Prevention of Pollution of Rivers and Streams. 74.—The principal object of this Bill was to improve the law for preventing the pollution of streams by extending to County Councils, Joint Committees, and River Boards in England the main provisions of the Mersey and Irwell Act, 1892, and the West Riding of Yorkshire Rivers Act of 1894. The Council petitioned in favour of the Bill, which was afterwards dropped. Borough Funds. 75.—Section 6 (6) of the London Government Act, 1899, extended the provisions of the Borough Funds Act, 1872. which relate to the powers of promoting and opposing Bills in Parliament to Metropolitan Borough Councils. The procedure under the provisions in question with reference to the promotion of or opposition to Bills in Parliament for the promotion or the protection of the interest of the inhabitants in Boroughs was unnecessarily cumbrous and in a populous Borough 69 such as Wandsworth inoperative. The object of the Borough Funds Bill was to simplify the procedure and this Council presented a petition in favour thereof. The Bill was passed. Employment of Children. 76.—The object of this Bill was to enable County or Borough Councils (in London the County Council) to make bye-laws for regulating the employment of children, and with respect to street trading by persons under the age of 16. The Council petitioned in favour of the Bill, which was passed. Weights and Measures. (Metric System). 77.—The object of this Bill is to render compulsory the use of the Metric System of Weights and Measures as recommended by a Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1895. The Council presented a petition in favour of the Bill which has passed the House of Lords and is awaiting second reading in the Commons. Rating of Machinery. 78.—This Bill proposed to exempt from rating all machinery not fixed or only so fixed that it can be removed without necessitating the removal of any part of the hereditament with the exception of any machinery, machine, or plant used for producing or transmitting first motive power or for heating or lighting the premises. The Council was of opinion that the Bill if passed would cause constant disputes to arise as to the rating of machinery, and presented a petition against it. The Bill was read a second time in the House of Commons and then dropped. 79.—No action was taken with regard to the other Bills abovementioned. London Electric Supply Corporation. 80.—This Company again enquired whether the Council would be prepared to recommend the granting to them of an Order for the supply of electrical energy in this Borough. The Company were asked whether they were prepared to offer consumers better terms than those offered by them last year. In reply the Company stated the terms upon which they would supply electricity in the event of their obtaining a Provisional Order. The Company were then informed that the Council could not support the application unless the 70 pany would undertake to supply electricity for lighting purposes at 4½d. per unit and for power at 2½d. per unit. The application was not proceeded with. Streatham Vestry Offices. 81.—These premises formerly used as the Streatham Vestry Offices and latterly as a rate collectors' office, have been sold by auction and the proceeds of the sale will be applied to the repayment of outstanding loans. An office for the rate collectors has been provided at the Council's premises, No. 158, Streatham High Road. Purchase of Property. 82.—In consequence of the difficulties experienced by the Council in purchasing property the following byelaw, similar to that of the London County Council on the same subject, has been made by this Council, viz.:— "Whenever a Committee is desirous of purchasing property which "can be legally acquired, and is of opinion that exceptional circum"stances render it prejudicial to the Council's interest that particulars as "to locality and value should be made public by reporting fully to the "Council, the Committee shall, in the first instance, bring the matter "before the General Purposes Committee, and if that Committee, by a "majority of the whole Committee, or three-fourths of those present "(the Members present being a majority of the whole Committee), "concur in the proposal, the General Purposes Committee shall then "send a memorandum, setting forth the circumstances of the case to the "Finance Committee, with a view to that Committee submitting an "estimate of the amount of the liability involved, with any observations "they may wish to make upon the financial bearings of the proposal; "and the report of the Finance Committee shall be considered by the "Council simultaneously with the report of the General Purposes Com"mittee containing the recommendation, but not containing such parti"culars as would lead to the identification of the property. In the "event of the Council adopting the recommendation of the General "Purposes Committee, the Executive Committee shall report full parti"culars as soon as practicable." 83.—The premises No. 215, Balham High Road at present used as the offices of the Surveyor for the Eastern District have been purchased by the Council. Hours of Polling. 84.—The Council presented a petition to the Local Government Board in favour of the hours of polling at Borough Council Elections being from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. instead of from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. 71 Unemployed. 85.—The Council considered the subject of the desirability of establishing a Labour Bureau for the unemployed residing in the Borough and came to the conclusion that it was not desirable to establish such a bureau, but decided to address a circular to employers of labour in the Borough stating that the Council would be willing to post outside its various depots and institutions intimations as to labour requirements if the employers would furnish the Council with the necessary information. The circular was accordingly sent to 418 employers of labour. Three firms notified their wants (girls for box-making, gardener's labourers, and Venetian blind painters respectively) which were accordingly posted outside the Council's depots and institutions. Telegraphic facilities. Wandsworth. 86.—The Postmaster-General was asked to give greater facilities for telephonic and telegraphic communication in the district between High Street, Wandsworth, and Bellevue Road telegraph offices, and it was suggested that the wants of the case would be met by making the Post office in Barmouth Road a complete telegraphic and telephonic station. The Postmaster-General stated that having carefully considered the matter he could not authorise the delivery of telegrams from the Barmouth Road office; that a change might with advantage be made as regards the district now served from Southfields on Sundays and on week-days after 8 p.m. and that it was proposed to open a call office in connection with the post office telephone system at Barmouth Road post office as soon as the necessary arrangements could be made. Port of London Sanitary Authority. 87.—An Inquiry was held at the Guildhall by the Local Government Board into the proposal to extend the area of the Port Sanitary Authority, so that such authority might exercise jurisdiction in the matter of unsound food, over other wharves, besides those being within any dock forming part of or abutting upon the Port of London. This Council and other Borough Councils objected to the transfer of powers of inspection from them to the Port Sanitary Authority, and after a Public Inquiry had been held the Local Government Board decided not to sanction the proposal. 72 Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. 88.—The attention of the Home Secretary was again called to the inadequacy of the fines inflicted in proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, in comparison with the offence and the cost to the Council of procuring the sample and of the analysis. Re-housing of persons of the Working Classes. 89.—The subject of the re-housing of persons of the working class displaced by the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Light and Coke Company under the Company's Act of 1900 was considered by the Council and the site at Merton Road, Wandsworth, on which it was proposed to erect dwellings in connection with the scheme was specially reported upon by the Medical Officer of Health (see page 97 of the report of the Medical Officer of Health.). A copy of the report was forwarded to the Home Secretary, who came to the conclusion that the piece of land objected to was so small that it could not affect the re-housine scheme. Removal of House Refuse. 90.—The Council agreed, on the application of the London County Council to remove the house refuse from Totterdown Fields estate, Tooting, twice a week upon condition that the refuse was placed in the forecourts of the houses for removal on the day fixed for the collection. The system has worked satisfactorily, the removal having been found to occupy about the same time as a weekly collection, when the men had to remove the refuse from the rear of the premises, and the Council has decided to continue the practice. Cleansing of Bakehouses. 91.—The bakehouse regulations made by the late District Board of Works provided for the cleansing of bakehouses in the months of March and September in every year. As the times fixed by the regulations had been found to be inconvenient the Council altered the months to April and October in every year. Sale of Bread. 92.—The attention of the Council was called to the exposure of bread for sale with deleterious and obnoxious articles but the Council came to the conclusion that it had no power in the matter. The London County Council considered the question of the desirability of seeking fresh legislation for the better protection of the public than is afforded under the existing law as regards the sale of bread. The Council 73 mended that the Act should be re-enacted in modern language and that provision should also be made for dealing with premises used for the sale of other goods and in which bread is exposed for sale. Analysis of Milk. 93.—Owing to the difficulty often experienced in procuring samples of milk in course of transit for analysis where such milk is delivered at railway stations outside the borough for sale in the borough the Westminster City Council suggested that some plan of combined action should be agreed upon whereby at the request and expense of the Council of the Borough to which milk is consigned, samples might be taken at the railway depots by the Inspectors of the Councils of the respective Boroughs to which such milk was consigned. The Council agreed with the suggestion, and a communication was addressed to the Board of Agriculture urging them to consider the desirability of inserting a clause in the Sale of Butter Bill then before Parliament which would give authority to a Sanitary Inspector of any Borough to take samples of milk, consigned to his district, for analysis, at any station situated in another Borough and being the place of delivery. It was not however found possible to include this provision in the Bill. Ambulances. 94.—The provision of ambulance accommodation has engaged the attention of the Council. The subject of placing the ambulance carriages of the Metropolitan Asylums Board at the disposal of the public for the conveyance in London of medical and surgical cases, and of persons of unsound mind was considered, but it was decided that while the Asylums Board was in the best position of any public body in London to provide a thoroughly efficient service with the least expenditure, the service could only legally be used for infectious diseases. 95.—The Council after considering the subject decided to support an application to the Local Government Board for the necessary legal authority to be given to the Metropolitan Asylums Board for giving effect to the proposal. 96.—Owing to representations made to the Council of the urgent need for a better and more efficient ambulance service other than for infectious diseases in various parts of the Borough, and the great inconvenience and suffering arising from the delay in, and in some cases the 74 impossibility of, procuring an ambulance a petition was presented to the London County Council suggesting that with the view of making the necessary provision in the matter a clause should be inserted in its next General Powers Bill empowering Metropolitan Borough Councils to provide ambulances. Ventilation of Sewers. 97.—A Special Committee of Members of the Public Health and Highways, Sewers, and Lighting Committees considered the subject of the ventilation of sewers in the Borough. The report thereon together with the reports of the Surveyors and Medical Officer of Health on the subject will be found in the report of the Medical Officer of Health, pages 140 to 154. Housing of the Working Classes. 98.—The Housing of the Working Classes has continued to receive the attention of the Council. Several suggestions which were made as to suitable sites for the erection of houses were carefully considered by the Public Health Committee, and the report of that Committee upon the subject is included in the report of the Medical Officer of Health, pages 91 to 93. SanitaryInspectors Duties. 99.—The Council considered the duties of the five Sanitary Inspectors who act under the supervision of the Surveyors in the construction of drainage works with the view of their re-appointment and the payment by the County Council of a moiety of their salaries. An application was made to the Local Government Board, but the County Council objected to the proposal on the ground that the supervision of the original construction of drainage works which is carried out under the Metropolis Management Acts is not one of the duties of a Sanitary Inspector prescribed by the Sanitary Officers (London) Order, 1891. The objection was upheld by the Local Government Board who, however, stated that under the circumstances they would offer no objection to the Inspectors acting under the general direction of the Medical Officer of Health supervising the construction of new drains of houses as well as the reconstruction of old drains, but, as the former duty is not one of the prescribed duties of a Sanitary Inspector under the General Order of 1891, it would be necessary if the Council desired to carry out the proposal, that a separate appointment should be made in each case 75 for the purpose of the supervision of the construction of new drains and a separate salary assigned to the officer no portion of which would be repayable by the London County Council. The Council ultimately decided to take no further action in the matter at present. Inspectors appointed under Canal Boats Act. 100.—In order to prevent the authority of the Sanitary Inspectors being disputed when carrying out inspections of barges on the river, the three Inspectors whose districts abut upon the river have been appointed, with the approval of the Local Government Board, Inspectors under the Canal Boats Act, 1877. Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897. 101.—On enquiry being made by the late School Board for London with regard to provision being made for giving effect to the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, the School Board were informed that the Act had not been put into operation in this Borough, but that any article of clothing sent to the disinfecting station would be disinfected in order to free it from vermin, and that if information were sent by the teachers of children in such a condition, giving their addresses to the Medical Officer of Health, the necessary steps would be taken to ensure the cleansing of the houses. Notification of Measles. 102.—An order was made by the London County Council and approved by the Local Government Board under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, including measles in the list of dangerous infectious diseases and extending to that disease the sections of the Act except as regards notification. The Metropolitan Asylums Board agreed to allow the use of their ambulances for the free conveyance of persons suffering from measles who are not in a position to pay for the hire of the same, and a notice was sent by the Council to medical men in the Borough calling their attention to the decision of the Asylums Board. Further information relating to measles will be found in the report of the Medical Officer of Health, page 60. Conveying of Carcases of Dead Horses. 103.—The following bye-laws with respect to the mode of conveying the carcases of dead horses through and along public streets in the county, prepared by the London County Council, viz.:— 76 Any person who shall convey the carcase of a dead horse through or along a public street in the County of London shall use for such purpose a vehicle constructed and closed in such manner that such carcase shall be completely concealed from public view, and the body of such vehicle shall be made of or lined with impervious material so as to prevent any liquid or discharge from the said carcase escaping from such vehicle. He shall so convey such carcase along the public streets with all reasonable despatch and so as to prevent any nuisance arising therefrom. Any person who shall offend against the foregoing bye-law shall be liable for each breach of such bye-law to a penalty not exceeding forty shillings. This bye-law shall not extend to the City of London. considered and approved by this Council. 104.—Other information relating to Public Health is contained in the Medical Officer's report in the appendix. Locomotives on Highways. 105.—The Council has from time to time received complaints from residents in the Borough of annoyance and damage caused by heavy locomotives passing along the streets and on each occasion the attention of the London County Council has been called to the complaint. A number of other Borough Councils have also been in communication with the London County Council on the subject and after consideration of the views expressed a Committee of that Council formulated bye-laws dealing with the matter. The undermentioned highways in this Borough would have been affected by the proposed byelaws, viz.:— (a) Highways on which use of locomotives restricted to the hours between 9 p.m. and, 8 a.m. on account of highways being crowded:— Lower Streatham, Streatham High Road, Streatham Hill, Brixton Hill; Tooting High Street, Upper Tooting Road, Balham High Road, Balham Hill, Clapham Common South Side (north of Cavendish Road), High Street (Clapham), Clapham Road, West Hill, High Street (Wandsworth), East Hill, Huguenot Place, North Side, Wandsworth Common, Clapham Common North Side, (between Victoria Road and Battersea Rise); St. John's Hill, Lavender Hill, Queen's Road, Wandsworth Road; Defoe Road, Garratt Lane, South Street, North Street (from East Hill to York Road), York Road. 77 (b) Highways on which use of locomotives restricted to the hours between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. on account of inconvenience caused to inhabitants, viz:— Christchurch Road; Mitcham Lane; Streatham Place, King's Road, Loat's Road, Bedford Road, Clapham Park Road, The Pavement, Clapham Old Town, North Street (Clapham), Silverthorne Road; Atkins Road (between Queen's Road and Streatham Place); Queen's Road (Clapham Park), Poynders Road, Cavendish Road (from Clapham Common to Poynders Road); Tooting Bec Road, Trinity Road, Wandsworth Common West Side (North of Trinity Road), Bellevue Road, Nightingale Lane, Clapham Common (west side) (between Nightingale Lane and Balham Hill), Earlsfield Road, Windmill Road; Spencer Park (south-east side); Wimbledon Park Road (south of Granville Road), Granville Road (between Merton Road and Wimbledon Park Road), Merton Road; Wimbledon Park Side, Putney Hill, Upper Richmond Road. (c) Highways which, in order to afford facilities for through traffic, may be used without restriction, viz.: Clapham Common South Side (between Cavendish Road and Clapham Common West Side). (d) Highways on which use of locomotives prohibited on account of such highways being crowded or unfit for locomotive traffic or because such use would cause inconvenience to the inhabitants, viz.:— All highways not being highways described in paragraph (a), (b), and (c). (c) Bridges on which use of locomotives prohibited, viz.:— Wandsworth bridge, Streatham High Road railway bridge. The draft bye-laws contained a proviso that the restrictions mentioned in paragraphs (a), (b), and (d.) should not apply to the use by a road authority within its district of a steam-roller or locomotive which was not used for hauling a wagon. 106.—With regard to these proposals this Council expressed the opinion that there should be no restriction as to time upon the use of locomotives on any thoroughfare in this Borough, and the London County Council was so informed. There appeared to be considerable divergence of opinion throughout London as to the extent to which heavy locomotive traffic on streets should be 78 restricted and upon the matter being further considered by the London County Council the above-mentioned draft bye-laws were withdrawn. The London County Council propose to convene a Conference of representatives of Metropolitan Local Authorities on the subject in the autumn. Contributions towards Improvements. 107.—A further Conference of representatives of Metropolitan Borough Councils convened by the Camberwell Borough Council to consider the subject of the varied treatment of Borough Councils by the London County Council in fixing the amount of the local and county contributions towards the cost of street improvements was held in October, 1903, when Councillor Lorden attended as this Council's representative. The observations of the various Borough Councils on the resolutions passed at the Conference in April, 1903, having been considered the following resolutions were passed, viz.:— (a) That the present system, whereby the London County Council claims from the Metropolitan Borough Councils contributions on varying bases for similar improvements, is contrary to the practice which should prevail in the Metropolis. (b) That, having regard to The rapid growth of London and the consequent increase in traffic, and to the necessity for some uniform practice being adopted, this Conference do now consider upon what principle it is prepared to recommend that the cost of London improvements should be borne. County Improvements (c) That the principle of treating London as a whole and of systematically selecting improvements best calculated to provide relief to the main thoroughfares, as advocated by a Select Committee of Parliament in 1871, should at once be formulated by the London County Council in a definite and comprehensive scheme for all future County improvements, and upon which London should equally contribute upon rateable value. Tramway Improvements. (d) That in all thoroughfares in which tramways are or may be constructed, a width of not less than 54 feet should be provided, unless the Road Authority otherwise consent, and the total cost of widening borne by the London County Council, either out of the tramways account or the county rate. Local Improvements. (e) That contributions to local authorities for local improvements should be, as far as possible, on a uniform basis. 79 108.—These resolutions are similar to those passed at the former Conference, this Council's suggestions set out in last year's report not having been adopted. London Building Acts. 109.—The Bill introduced into Parliament by the London County Council in the Session of 1903 for the amendment of the Building Act was promoted chiefly with the object of reducing fire risks in high buildings. Many objections having been made to the Bill it was withdrawn and a Committee of the County Council then took into consideration the question of the general amendment of the Acts. In response to an invitation for this Council's observations on the subject the County Council was informed— (a) That the Borough Council adhered to the resolution passed on the 4th February, 1903, calling attention to the fact that many of the provisions of the London Building Acts (Amendment) Bill then before Parliament were unsatisfactory and likely to cause contention owing to the uncertainty which would arise as to the requirements which the County Council might make under them. (b) That the Borough Council was of opinion that where the external or forecourt wall of a building was set back the prescribed distance from the centre of the road or where the London County Council had consented to the erection of a building upon condition that the land in front be given up to the public, it should be made clear by the statute that the land separating the building from the public way was to form part of the public way. (c) That it appeared to the Borough Council to be impossible in practice to distinguish between what was included in the term "wooden structure" used in section 84 of the Act of 1894, and what was included in the term "building or structure" used in sections 82 and 83, and, as the larger wooden structures and all corrugated iron temporary buildings were licensed by the London County Council under sections 82 and 83 the Borough Council was of opinion that the administration of section 84 (which was transferred to Borough Councils by the London Government Act, 1899) should revert to the County Council; (d) That the Borough Council was of opinion that the powers and duties of the District Surveyors should be transferred to the Borough Councils. The County Council still have the matter under consideration. 80 Width of Roads. 110.—The Highways, &c., Committee have had under consideration the subject of the varying widths of carriageways and footpaths in the Borough. With the view of securing uniformity throughout the Borough as far as possible, the Council upon the recommendation of the Committee passed the following resolutions, viz.:— (a) That in future in all roads about to be formed 40 feet in width, each footpath be made 8 feet wide. (b) That as a general rule in future in all roads about to be formed 45 feet or 50 feet in width, each footpath be made 9 feet wide, and that if it is probable that a double line of tramways will be constructed in any street 50 feet wide the Surveyors be instructed to report specially to the Committee as to the widths of the paths when the road is about to be formed, in order that sufficient accommodation may be provided for the tramway. (c) That in all cases of roads about to be formed of greater width than those above-mentioned and of existing roads where the footpaths are about to be re-constructed, the Surveyors report specially to the Committee as to the widths of the footpaths. Wandle Bridge, at High Street, Wandsworth. 111.—During the past few years a number of accidents,—some having a fatal result,—have occurred at the bridge carrying High Street, Wandsworth, over the River Wandle owing to the ease with which children could climb on to the gas and water pipes alongside the bridge. On each occasion the attention of the London County Council has been called to the highly dangerous condition of the bridge, the Borough Council having always contended that the bridge was a county bridge, and in connection with one of these accidents some 3 years ago the County Council were urged to reconstruct and widen the bridge with the view of preventing further loss of life there. The County Council, however, declined to accede to the request and refused to recognise the structure as a county bridge. 112.—In July, 1903, another fatal accident occurred, a lad falling from the gas and water mains there and being drowned. In view of the urgency of the matter the Borough Council, although not responsible for the bridge, gave instructions for temporary measures to be taken to prevent children from climbing on to the pipes. The attention of the County Council, the Gas and Water 81 Companies, and the Police was again called to the danger, and the Companies then fixed a railing to protect their pipes. It is hoped that the action take by the Borough Council and the Companies will prevent any further loss of life. 113.—In the meantime the Borough Council continued to press upon the London County Council the necessity of some steps being taken by that Council in the matter and the Town Clerk produced to the officers of the County Council further evidence that the bridge had at one time been regarded as a county bridge. After considerable correspondence the County Council has at last agreed, without expressly admitting its liability, to undertake the future control of the bridge, and an agreement has been entered into for the roadway and footpaths over the bridge and its approaches to be maintained by the Borough Council upon payment by the County Council of £80 per annum. The question of widening the bridge is under the consideration of the London County Council. 114.—The subject of stopping up the approach to the river on the eastern side of the bridge and of an agreement with an owner of adjoining property is under the consideration of the Borough Council. Electrical Tramways and Tramways Improvements. 115.—The question of the proposed construction of a line of electrical tramways along York Road, Red Lion Street, South Street, Garratt Lane, Defoe Road, and Tooting High Street, and the widening of that thoroughfare in connection therewith has continued to receive the attention of the Council, and the County Council has been repeatedly urged to press forward the acquisition of the necessary property in order that the tramway works may be proceeded with. A large part of the land required on the eastern side of Garratt Lane having been purchased, arrangements have been made for the Borough Council to execute the work of paving the footpath there, the cost to be charged to the improvement. 116.—The County Council has not yet come to a decision as to the system of electrical traction to be adopted on these lines and it having come to the knowledge of the Council that in all 82 bability it would not be possible for the proposed tramways to be worked by electricity until the completion of the new generating station at Greenwich the Borough Council has asked the County Council to adopt horse traction along this route as a temporary measure, especially in view of the fact that the cars on the York Road lines with which the new tramway will connect are drawn by horses. 117.—Complaint having been made by the Borough Council and the Commissioner of Police of the obstruction caused by the tramcars at the Tooting Terminus the County Council with the view of providing improved terminal facilities has commenced the extension of the Tooting lines to Tooting Broadway and also along Defoe Road. The Board of Trade have approved the underground conduit system of electrical traction for these short lengths subject to reasonable arrangements as to feeder pillars. A suitable position has been agreed for the one pillar at present required. In the section in Tooting High Street the County Council with the view of obtaining satisfactory results from the use of wood paving between the tramway rails proposes to lay a short iength of track with yokes of an improved and stronger type and paved experimentally in 6 lengths of 50 feet each with the following materials, viz.:—Jarrah untreated, Jarrah jodelited, beech creosoted, deal creosoted, deal jodelited, and Aberdeen granite setts. In the parts of the road where no widenings are being made the paving of the margins of the carriageways and of the footpaths will be carried out by the Borough Council at its own cost. Electrical Traction on Tramways. 118.—With regard to the feeder pillars placed on the footpath in the road leading from Clapham to Tooting for the purpose of controlling the various sections of the electrical tramways there, the County Council after considerable correspondence, agreed to remove the pillar in High Street, Clapham, to a less inconvenient position. The other pillars which the Borough Council desired to be shifted were those opposite Nos. 64 and 66, Upper Tooting Road and the London and County Bank at No. 128, Balham High Road. In the first case the total width of the footpath was 8 feet 4 inches and by the erection of the pillar the width available for pedestrians has been reduced to 5 feet 3 inches. In the second case out of a total width of 83 9 feet 7 inches a width of 6 feet 5 inches only was left for foot traffic. The question of shifting these pillars was discussed at a Conference of the Highways Committee of the County Council and representatives of the Borough Council (The Mayor; Aldermen Anderson, Kipling, Hewett; Councillors Wise and Rose) on the 9th June last, when the Chairman of that Committee pointed out that the cost of the removal of the pillar in High Street would be £500 and of the other 2 pillars £600 and £250 respectively, but stated that the subject would be further carefully considered. The Borough Council were subsequently informed that the County Council's officers had been instructed to place themselves in communication with the Borough Council's officers with the view some arrangement satisfactory to both Councils being come to in the matter. Streatham TramwayLines. 119.—In August, 1903, the Board of Trade approved the reconstruction for electrical traction of the cable tramways from Brixton to Streatham, the underground conduit system being adopted as in the case of the Tooting tramways. The Borough Council at first objected to feeder pillars being placed upon the public way in connection with the electrical mains and asked the County Council to devise other means of dealing with the matter. Upon further consideration the objection was withdrawn on the understanding that the pillars were placed in suitable positions, and these were subsequently satisfactorily arranged. The work of reconstruction was carried out in the spring of this year in a very expeditious manner, the lines being inspected on the 18th June by Lieut.-Colonel Yorke, R.E. (on behalf of the Board of Trade), and re-opened for traffic the same day. The Mayor, the Chairman of the Committee (Councillor Wise), together with Alderman Rucker, Councillors Cresswell, Wellborne, and Ball, and accompanied by the Town Clerk and the Surveyor for the Eastern District, represented the Borough Council at the inspection. 120.—Arrangements similar to those agreed to in the case of the Tooting lines were made for indicating the stopping places for the electrical cars by fixing notices thereof to the public lamps, and the County Council has been asked to adopt some means of indicating the stopping places at night. 84 121.—In connection with the reconstruction of these lines the Borough Council decided to carry out the necessary wood and stone paving works in the parts of the road not maintainable by the County Council at an estimated cost of £3,370. 122.—Before it was known that the tramways would be reconstructed at so early a date the Borough Council had arranged for the widening of Streatham High Road between Mount Ephraim Road and the Tate Public Library, some of the land being given up upon buildings being allowed to be erected to a certain line and pavement lights placed in front, the remainder of the land being purchased by the Borough Council subject to the leases of two properties which had several years to run. The Borough Council pointed out to the County Council that if the new tramway lines were placed in the same positions as the old ones they would not be in the middle of the road when widened, that with the view of preventing an awkward curve in the lines it was desirable to acquire the leases so as to complete the improvement at once instead of waiting for the leases to expire, that the widening between the roads above-mentioned would render necessary the reconstruction of the whole width of Streatham High Road, and asked the County Council to contribute two-thirds of the total nett cost of the improvement which was estimated at £9,314 exclusive of the tramways and the portion of the road maintainable by the London County Council. The Mayor, Alderman Hewett, Councillors Parker and Wise, had an interview with the Highways Committee of the County Council on the 16th February on the subject, and shortly afterwards the County Council consented to the widening and agreed to make the contribution asked for. The matter being urgent the Highways Committee of the Borough Council were authorised to settle terms for the acquisition of the property. The negotiations were carried to a successful conclusion very speedily and the strips of land required have been thrown into the public way. The work of re-paving the road is now in hand. Clapham Park Road. Further Widening. 123.—Nos. 126 to 136 (even, inclusive), Clapham Park Road have been purchased in order to further widen that road at its junction with Park Hill. The buildings have been removed and the work of paving the land added to the 85 public way is in hand. The estimated cost of this supplemental improvement is £3,000. The Council has decided to erect a public bath-house on part of the surplus land. North Street and Rectory Grove, Clapham, Widening. 124.—The proceedings for the acquisition of the remaining properties required for this improvement have been concluded, the Council having now come to terms with all the owners. Arrangements are being made for the removal of the projecting walls and buildings, and the Council trusts to be able to complete the improvement very shortly. Mitcham Road, Tooting-, Widening. 125.—As opportunities occurred the late District Board of Works and the Council have from time to time secured the widening of parts of Mitcham Road, Tooting, the London County Council agreeing in most cases to pay one-half the cost. The County Council having in contemplation the construction of a tramway from Tooting Broadway to Tooting Junction Railway Station suggested that the road should be widened to 54 feet throughout at an estimated cost of £44,700 and asked this Council to pay one-third the cost. The Borough Council was willing to consent to the proposed tramway, subject to the usual conditions, but was of opinion that having regard to the importance of the thoroughfare it should be widened to not less than 60 feet throughout, and the Council forwarded to the London County Council a plan prepared by the Surveyor for the Eastern District showing how this width could be obtained at considerably less cost than the above-mentioned estimate, the total estimated cost of carrying out this plan being £16,636, including the cost of widenings already effected. The County Council adopted the Borough Council's plan and agreed to contribute two-thirds of the nett cost, subject to the contribution being limited to £11,091. The Borough Council is now taking steps to acquire the necessary property. Tooting High Street, Widening. 126.—The purchases of the properties required for the widening of Tooting High Street, between the Castle public-house and Defoe Road, have been completed, and the owners are now re-building their premises to the new line, part of the arrangement being that they should be allowed to carry on their businesses in the front portions of their old buildings 86 whilst doing so. The London County Council are proceeding with the widening of the part of the road between the tramway terminus and the Castle public-house. Tooting High Street and Effort Street, Widening. 127.—The Council has now purchased the whole of the land required for the widening of Tooting High Street opposite the St. Leonard's estate, and also the strip of land for the proposed extension of Effort Street to Hoyle Road. With the view of completing the former improvement steps are being taken to set back the fences and pave the land added to the public way. Tooting High Street, Extension of Tramways and Widening. 128.—The County boundary at Tooting having been altered the London County Council proposed to apply for power to extend the tramway authorised to be laid in Merton Road (now Tooting High Street) from the old to the new boundary and to widen the road there. The estimated cost of the necessary property and paving works (exclusive of laying down and paving the tramway tracks) was £2,500, towards which the Borough Council was asked to contribute one-third. The Borough Council were prepared to consent to the proposed tramway, subject to certain conditions, but expressed the opinion that inasmuch as the widening of the road would be rendered necessary solely by the construction of a line of tramways there the Borough Council should not be called upon to contribute towards the cost. The London County Council thereupon decided not to proceed further with the matter. Closing Footpath, Totterdown Fields. 129.—In connection with the development of the Totterdown Fields estate for the purpose of erecting cottages for the working classes the London County Council desired to stop up a public footpath across the estate leading from Totterdown to Franciscan Road. This Council consented to the proposal and new roads having been provided in place of the old footpath the necessary order has been made for the latter to be stopped up. Trinity Road, Balham, Widening. 130.—All the interests in the properties required for the widening of Trinity Road, Balham, between Balham High Road and St. Nicholas Road, have been acquired and the fences set back to the new lines. The footpaths 87 where the road has been widened have been partly paved with artificial stone and the carriageway of the part of the road within the Balham Ward paved with wood. The London County Council in January last consented to the improvement and agreed to contribute half the cost, the contribution not to exceed the sum of £4,000. Cavendish Road, Balham, Widening. 131.—The Council is arranging for the widening of the narrow part of Cavendish Road, Balham, at an estimated cost of £1,600, including the necessary paving works. Terms have been agreed with the owners of some of the property required and the negotiations for the acquisition of the remainder are in progress. High Street & Gardener's Lane, Putney, Widening. 132.—At the request of the late District Board the London County Council in 1900 obtained power to widen the narrow part of High Street, Putney, opposite Putney Bridge Road, and the part of Gardener's Lane at its junction with High Street. The estimated cost was £45,030, and the London County Council agreed to contribute one-half the cost in the case of High Street and one-fourth in that of Gardener's Lane, the total contribution to be limited to £15,000. Since coming into office the Borough Council has constantly urged the County Council to press forward the acquisition of the necessary property as speedily as possible in order that the widening might be carried out, but great difficulty has been experienced in settling with some of the owners, satisfactory terms being agreed only after prolonged negotiations. The purchases have however now been completed and the greater part of the buildings removed. By arrangement with the County Council the Borough Council will execute the paving works, the cost of which will of course be charged to the improvement. These works will be put in hand as soon as the land required for widening is thrown into the public way. High Street, Putney, and Coopers Arms Lane, Widening. 133.—The necessary order has been obtained for closing Pepper Alley, a public footpath leading out of the west side of High Street, Putney, and giving access to some cottages (now demolished) belonging to Brandon's Putney Brewery, Limited. The Brewery Company have secured the conveyance to the Council of a small part of the 88 site of Nos. 66 and 68, High Street, and the conveyance of a strip of Nos. 58 to 64, is in hand. This land will in due course be added to the public way. The Company have also conveyed to the Council a piece of land in Cooper's Arms Lane required for widening that thoroughfare and the paving works in connection with this part of the improvement are in hand. Lower Richmond Road, Putney, Improvement. 134.—The Highways Committee of the Council have for some time had under consideration the subject of the inconvenience and danger arising from the inadequate width of Lower Richmond Road, Putney, and a general scheme for widening the road as opportunities occur has been approved. The Council upon the recommendation of the Committee has decided to proceed with the most urgent part of the improvement at once. The estimated cost is £5,830, towards which the London County Council has ben asked to contribute but has not yet agreed to do so. In the meantime certain properties required for the widening have been purchased. It is proposed to pave the carriageway with wood when the improvement has been effected. High Street, Wandsworth, and St. Ann's Hill, Widening. 135.—The purchase of the projecting part of the National School premises on the eastern side of St. Ann's Hill, has been completed and the land added to the public way and paved. The question of the disposal of the surplus land at the corner of High Street and on the western side of St. Ann's Hill has been deferred for the present. West Hill Improvement. 136.—On the Council coming into office in November, 1900, certain cottages on the northern side of West Hill which had been purchased by the late District Board in 1896-7 with the view of widening the road were transferred to the Council. This improvement has from time to time been under consideration chiefly in connection with various projects of the London County Council to construct a line of tramways or light railways from Clapham to Kingston Vale, and as the several schemes were successively dropped the widening was deferred in anticipation of the next proposal. The last of these tramway schemes was withdrawn in the early part of 1902 and the Borough Council then decided to itself proceed with the improvement subject to a satisfactory contribution towards the cost being made 89 by the County Council. After some correspondence that Council in December, 1902, gave its consent to the widening and agreed to contribute two-thirds of the nett cost, subject to the contribution not exceeding the sum of £15,866 and to this Council agreeing to consent to the construction of a tramway along the portion of the road to be widened, viz.:—between the police station and Santos Road. These conditions were accepted by the Borough Council. 137.—In the meantime the Highways Committee of the Borough Council had been in communication with the owners of the property required and on the 29th October, 1902, the Committee were authorised by the Borough Council to deal with the claims for compensation. Since that time the acquisition of the properties has been pressed forward as rapidly as possible. The negotiations for the purchase of some of the interests were of a lengthy character but eventually the Council was able to agree terms with the owners with one exception. In that case it became necessary to take the matter before a jury as the compensation finally claimed was more than the Council felt justified in paying having regard to the advice of the valuers and accountants retained by the Council. The jury having made their award, which exceeded the amount offered, the purchase of this interest has also been completed. Possession of the last property required (Priorsdean House) was obtained in July last and the necessary arrangements have been made for this building to be removed. In the other parts of the road all the fences have been set back and the paving works executed. These works included the paving with artificial stone of two new footpaths of adequate width and woodpaving the carriageway. 138.—The part of West Hill in question forms part of an important thoroughfare leading out of London and was formerly owing to its narrowness and steepness dangerous for the large and increasing traffic passing over it. It has now been made 60 feet in width and the gradient has been improved. The Borough Council has pleasure in recording that the undertaking, one of the largest of its kind carried out by the Council, has now been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. 90 Putney Bridge Road, Widening. 130.—Steps are being taken with the view of paving as a new street the part of Putney Bridge Road, Wandsworth, between the London and South-Western Railway bridge and the western boundary of Wandsworth Park. The London County Council having given up the necessary land the part of the road in front of the Park has been widened to 50 feet, and the Borough Council is now taking steps to continue the widening to the railway bridge. An agreement has been entered into for the necessary land belonging to the Railway Company to be added to the public way at an estimated cost of £1,089:19:3, and the Council is now negotiating for the acquisition of the other property required. Merton Road, Wandsworth, Widening, and Sanitary Convenience. 140.—In connection with the re-building of the Park Tavern the Council has arranged for the widening of Merton Road in front of the premises to 54 feet, the rounding off of the angle at the junction of Merton Road and West Hill Road, and the construction of a public underground sanitary convenience on the corner. The owners of the premises have agreed to give up the necessary land provided the Council pave the forecourt and construct the convenience. The estimated cost of the works is as follows, viz.:— paving forecourt, £205; paving land to be added to the public way, £250; constructing convenience, £900; total, £1,455. The consent of the Local Government Board to the borrowing of the money required for the works has been obtained and the agreement with the owners embodying the above-mentioned terms will probably be completed shortly. New Road at Garratt Green. 141.—The question of the desirability of improving the means of communication from Burntwood Lane round Garratt Green (which is vested in the London County Council) to Garratt Lane has continued to receive the attention of the Borough Council. The alternative suggestions of this Council were:—(1) That a strip of Garratt Green where it abuts upon Aboyne Road should be thrown into the public way so as to make that road 40 feet in width, or (2) That a new road should be formed on the western side of the green. The County Council at first declined to agree to either of these proposals but upon further consideration the Parks and Open Spaces Committee of 91 that Council stated that if the owners of certain adjoining land, the value of which would be enhanced by the improvement, would pay the cost of constructing the proposed new road so that no portion thereof would fall upon the ratepayers, the Committee would recommend the County Council to consent to the second suggestion. This Council thereupon placed itself in communication with the owners referred to but were not able to induce them to bear the cost of the new road, and the Parks Committee have not therefore seen their way to take any further action in the matter. Flooding from Sewers. 142.—The question of the flooding of premises from, sewers at times of heavy rain has continued to receive the earnest consideration of the Council. For some years past this Council and its predecessors the late District Board have urged the London County Council to carry out the necessary works to relieve the main sewers in the districts specially affected in this Borough, viz.:— Balham High Road, West Streatham, Tooting, Summerstown, Garratt Lane, and York Yoad, Wandsworth. Other Boroughs in South London have also suffered considerably from similar floodings, and at a Conference of representatives of South London Borough Councils convened by the Southwark Borough Council and held on the 15th October last a deputation was appointed to wait upon the County Council on the subject. The deputation, upon which Aldermen Anderson and Bulcraig with the Surveyor for the Western District represented this Council, attended before a joint Meeting of the Main Drainage and General Purposes Committees of the London County Council in November when the Mayor of Southwark, Alderman Anderson, and Alderman Kennard laid before the Committees details of the floodings, pointed out the serious danger to the health of the inhabitants of the South London Boroughs likely to arise from the periodical flooding of their premises with sewage, and urged upon the County Council the necessity of taking steps to deal with the question at the earliest possible date. 143.—The County Council in January last in response to further letters from this Council stated that the general question of relieving the districts affected so far as it related to the provision of adequate main sewer accommodation was engaging the 92 most serious attention of the County Council, and that every endeavour was being made to put in hand such works as might be deemed most practicable and efficient with as little delay as possible; that as regards Wandsworth the formation of four overflows into the river Wandle for the purpose of relieving the Garratt Lane sewer would be carried out very shortly, that the new relief sewer from Balham High Road to Mayford Road would also be completed in the course of a few weeks, that the Main Drainage Committee had for some time had under consideration the desirability of erecting a pumping station for dealing with the storm water in the Western portion of the Borough, that the necessary investigations were being made to enable the Committee to submit some definite proposal to the County Council in the immediate future, that the views which had been expressed by this Council and other local authorities since the proposal was first made were borne in mind and that while it was impossible at present to state what conclusion would ultimately be arrived at this Council might rest assured that the requirements of the district, so far as main drainage is concerned, would not be lost sight of; and that it was hoped that this Council would be satisfied that the County Council was desirous of taking such action as would prove the most efficient method for the disposal of the storm water from the districts subject to flooding. 144.—As a result of the various representations made to the County Council on the subject from time to time, that Council has recently completed the construction of the above-mentioned relief sewer at Balham and the four overflows from the Garratt Lane sewer, and it is hoped these works will afford some measure of relief. This Council's suggestion that a storm overflow from the sewer in Garratt Lane should be laid across the Borough Council's shoot at Garratt Park has not yet been adopted by the County Council. 145.—With the view of improving the sewage accommodation this Council has enlarged the sewers in Blackshaw Road, Tooting, and Summerstown; and also the sewers in Merton Road and Lavenham Road, Wandsworth, in order to divert from the Garratt Lane sewer the sewage from a large estate which is being developed for building purposes in the last-mentioned neighbourhood. 93 146.—With regard to the flooding at West Streatham the Borough Council revived the suggestion made by the late District Board that a relief sewer should be constructed in Greyhound Lane and asked the County Council to pay part of the cost. The County Council however while sanctioning the carrying out of the work refused to contribute towards the cost which will accordingly be borne by this Council. Arrangements have been made with the owners of certain land abutting upon Greyhound Lane and steps are being taken with the view of the work of constructing the sewer being put in hand at once. Principles of Drainage. 147.—The Highways, &c., Committee have recently considered as to the methods of drainage of new properties and of re-construction of old drains in the Borough, and having conferred with the Surveyors thereon, have settled the general principles upon which such drainage shall be carried out. Owing however to the varying conditions of many cases which come before the Council it may be necessary to modify these rules in some instances and the Committee will continue to consider each proposal on its merits. 148.—The Committee also considered the subject of the proposed alteration of the Council's regulations for the drainage of houses rendered necessary by the Bye-laws made by the London County Council under the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and the Metropolis Management Amendment (Bye-laws) Act, 1899, and upon the recommendation of the Committee the Council has revised its regulations for the drainage of houses. The Committee have also settled the forms of notices for the erection of new buildings and for the re-construction of drains, and have approved two plans typical of those which should be sent in with such notices. The latter may be seen at the offices of the Surveyors. Council's Employees. 149.—The general question of the conditions of labour of the workmen employed by the Council has been under the consideration of the Highways, &c., Committee who have gone very fully into the matter. The Council has passed the following resolutions on the subject, viz.:— 94 Wages. That road sweepers and carmen (other than carmen employed in the removal of house refuse) in the employ of the Council between the ages of 21 and 60 years be paid at the rate of not less than 25/- per week on the understanding that they remain daily servants as at present. Uniform Clothing. That after 12 months' service each road-sweeper and carman in the employ of the Council (other than carmen employed in the removal of house refuse) be provided annually with a cap, jacket, and numbered badge, and each road-sweeper and carman in the employ of the Council (other than carmen employed in the removal of house refuse) with less than 12 months' service with a numbered badge. Sick Pay. (a) That sick allowances be made to workmen in the employ of the Council at the following rates, viz.:— One year's to 3 years' service—Full pay for the first week and half-pay for the following two weeks. 3 years' to 7 years' service—Full pay for the first week and half-pay for the following three weeks. 7 years' service and upwards—Full pay for the first week and half-pay for the following five weeks. (b) That the sick-allowance commence immediately the workman is absent through illness duly certified. (c) That sick-allowance be made only upon production of a medical certificate in each case. (d) That at the expiration of the above-mentioned periods the Surveyors be instructed to report to the Committee if the workman has not recovered sufficiently to return to his duties in order that the question of continuing the allowance may be considered. Holidays. That all workmen in the employ of the Council be allowed, after 12 months' service, one week's holiday in summer besides Christmas Day, Good Friday, and Bank Holidays. Baths. 150.—The number of persons using the baths has continued to increase. The number of bathers during the year ended 31st March was 118,030 as compared with 107,924 during the previous year, made up as follows, viz.:— 95  1902-3. 1903-4. Mens first-class private baths 7,011 7,019 Women's do. do. 559 601 Men's second-class do. 18,580 19,134 Women's do. do. 3,972 6,531 First-class swimming bath 23,020 26,355 Second-class do. 54,782 58,390 Totals 107,924 118,030 The receipts were:—£1,163:16:4 in 1902-3, and £1,243:16:11 in 1903-4,—an increase of £80:0:7. 151.—The baths are open on week-days from 7 a.m. to 9.30 p.m. and on Sundays from 7 a.m. to 9.30 a.m. The swimming baths are reserved for ladies at the following times, viz.:— First Class— Tuesdays 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. „ „ Thursdays 7 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. ,, „ Fridays 9 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. Second Class—Mondays, Wednesdays & Thursdays 2 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. „ „ Tuesdays 7 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. Hire of Bath. 152.—The first-class swimming bath was let on several occations for entertainments and polo matches, the total receipts therefrom amounting to £32:5:9. Rifle Practice. 153.—The Council again allowed the use of the secondclass swimming bath during the winter season to miniature rifle clubs for practice when the bath was not required for swimming—upon payment of the cost of lighting. 154.—The swimming bath was open during the winter season as follows:— Thursday, for ladies 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. first-class. Fridays, for men 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. first-class. Saturdays, for men 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. second-class. Sundays, for men 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. second-class. 96 Championship Trophy. 155.—The competition for the trophy presented by Mr. W. J. Lancaster, J.P., and competed for annually by men residing in the Borough, was held on the 15th October at the annual entertainment of the Wandsworth Borough Officer's Club. Twelve entries were received and the trophy was won by Mr. C. F. Milnes. A prize was presented to the winner by Mr. Lancaster as a memento of the occasion, and prizes were presented by the Club to Mr. W. Shettle and Mr. C. A. Symons who finished second and third respectively. Women's Medal. 156.—The competition for the medal for women residing in the Borough, presented by Mr. John Bell, J.P., was held on the 8th October at the annual entertainment of the Alexandra Swimming Club, and was won by Miss D. Vaughan. Competitions. 157.—Competitions were also held for boys and girls residing in the Borough. Prizes to the value of £5:5:0 were divided between learners' and swimmers' races, which were conducted on behalf of the Council by the Wandsworth Schools Swimming Association. Flooring over Bath. 158.—After careful consideration the Council decided to floor over the first-class swimming bath and provide a gymnasium during the winter season. Tenders were invited for the construction of the floor and that of Messrs. Charles Peacock & Co. to carry out the work for the sum of £190 was accepted. 159.—Gymnastic apparatus was supplied by Messrs. Heath and George at a cost of £99:8:2 and the gymnasium was opened by the Mayor on the 28th November when an entertainment was given by the gymnastic students of the Battersea Polytechnic and scholars of Eltringham Street and Swaffield Road schools. Gymnasium. 160.—An Instructor and Instructress were engaged during the season, and classes held under their tuition. The gymnasium was used by 3,256 persons. The receipts though not quite equal to the expectation of the Baths Committee, were sufficient to pay the salaries of the Instructor and Instructress. The Committee hope that the gymnasium will be used by a greater number next season. 97 River Wall. 161.—The river wall adjoining the baths, the licence for which was granted by the London County Council and the contract entered into last year with Mr. J. F. Coxhead has been completed at a cost of £1,050:0:10. Dr. Watney, the owner of the land on the opposite bank of the river, objected to the line of the embankment licensed by the London County. Council. In order that the work might be proceeded with without loss of time the Council agreed to set back the wall in rear of the baths to the line agreed upon with Dr. Watney. The Council are in communication with Dr. Watney with the view of an Order of the Magistrate being made for stopping up the approach to the river Wandle from the eastern end of the bridge. Water Supply. 162.—Upwards of 14,000,000 gallons of water have been used during the year, 8,000,000 of which were obtained from the artesian well, and the remaining 6,000,000 from the Water Company. The pump to the artesian well has given trouble on two or three occasions, and it was found necessary to renew the rods at a cost of £27:10:0. An accident also occurred to the valve which interfered with the working of the pump for several weeks. The Council in order to avoid delay in the event of a future breakdown has procured the necessary hoisting tackle, and the removal of the rods will in future be commenced by the Council's staff immediately an accident occurs. Direction Plates on Lamps. 163.—Direction plates have been fixed on street lamps in the Borough indicating the position of the public baths. Washing Towels. 164.—The Council has decided that all the towels required for use in the public lavatories and other establishments belonging to the Council shall in future be supplied from and washed at the baths at Wandsworth, where all the necessary machinery and apparatus is provided. 98 Burial Fees. 165.—The paragraph in the table of fees relating to the double fees in the Streatham and Wandsworth cemeteries and the treble fees in the Putney Vale cemetery for the burial of non-parishioners has been amended so as to provide that such fees shall not be payable in respect of the interment of the body of a person being the husband or wife or an ancestor or descendant of the purchaser in a direct line. 166.— The paragraph relating to the fee for the burial of persons chargeable to the Union has also been amended so as to limit it to the burial of the bodies of persons chargeable to the Union and parishioners of the Borough of Wandsworth. 167.—Under the Borough of Wandsworth (Union of Parishes) Scheme, 1903, the Burial Acts are to be in force throughout the Borough and parishioners' fees will from the 1st April, 1904, be charged for the interment in the Council's cemeteries of parishioners of Tooting as well as of parishioners of the other parishes of which the Borough is constituted. 168.—The contract with the South Metropolitan Cemetery Company for the burial at Norwood cemetery of Clapham parishioners was determined by the Council on the 25th March, 1904. Land adjoining Wandsworth Cemetery. 169.—Application was made by the Earlsfield and District Rifle Club for permission to erect a club-house and rifle range on part of the land adjoining Wandsworth cemetery. This proposal was agreed to by the Council, but in consequence of some restrictions which the Authorities of Magdalen College, Oxford, desired to have inserted the club declined to enter into the agreement and the matter was dropped. The subject of using the land was considered by the Council and tenders invited for clearing, levelling and sowing the land with grass seed with the view of afterwards letting it for recreative purposes. No satisfactory tender having been received the Council subsequently accepted the offer of Mr. H. W. Benham to rent the land for recreative purposes. 99 A portion of the land has been retained by the Council for burial purposes and a fence is to be erected to divide the land which has been let from the cemetery. Putney Vale Cemetery. 171.—In 1889 the Secretary of State approved of the land at the entrance to Putney Vale cemetery between Kingston Road and the Chapels being used for burial purposes provided that no interments took place therein within 10 years, but a covenant in the conveyance of the land purchased for the cemetery prohibited the use of this part of the land for this purpose. The consent of the vendor (the late Duke of Cambridge) was however in February last obtained by the Council to burials taking place there and the Council has decided that three-fourths of the land should be consecrated. Steps are being taken to carry this decision into effect. Interments. 172.—The number of interments in the Council's cemeteries for the years ended 31st March, 1903 and 1904 respectively was as follows:— 1903. 1904. Putney Lower Common Cemetery 50 34 Putney Vale Cemetery .293 308 Streatham Cemetery 716 874 Wandsworth Cemetery 1,053 1,512 Clapham parishioners interred at Norwood Cemetery under the contract with the South Metropolitan Cemetery Co. 239 189 Total 2,351 2,917 Grave Spaces. 173.—The number of grave spaces purchased during the last two years were:— Year ended March, 1903.

Librarian: J. Reed Welch. 4 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIVISIONAL COMMITTEE of Clapham public pibrarn, For the Year ending 31st March, 1904. The Committee have pleasure in reporting steady progress in every department. The result of purchasing many new and valuable works and replacing worn-out books has been the considerable increase in the number of volumes issued. This increase appears in each class except one, History and Biography, where there is a slight decrease on the previous year. The number of volumes now in stock is 12,580. The number issued during the year was 88,194, an increase of 10,636, as compared with the previous year, and representing a daily average issue of 361 volumes. A supplementary catalogue of books added to the Lending Library since the publication of the general catalogue in 1899 was compiled by the Librarian and published in May, 1903, and has been much appreciated by the readers. The experiment of keeping open the lending Library till nine p.m. on Saturdays not having proved a success, the closing at eight o'clock has been resumed, without apparently causing any inconvenience to the public. A new open book-case has been provided in the Reference Library, in which is placed a number of works in frequent request, such as Dictionaries, Cyclopaedias, etc. During the summer of 1903 the Library building was repaired and painted inside and out, and the two lamps at the front entrance fitted with incandescent burners, one of which is kept burning all night as a public lamp. In November, 1903, the Council appointed Alderman Dunkley and Councillor Colman as Members of the Committee in place of Messrs. Gibson and Lidiard. The Committee have again much pleasure in expressing their appreciation of the satisfactory manner in which the Librarian and his staff have discharged their duties, and congratulate Mr. A. Nash on his promotion by the Council to be librarian-in-charge of the Wandsworth Branch Library, after nearly fifteen years service at the Clapham Library. On behalf of the Committee, Charles P. Greene, Chairman. 30th May, 1904. 5 NUMBER OF VOLUMES IN STOCK On 31st March, 1904, AND Volumes Issued from 1st April, 1903, To 31st March, 1904. Vols. in Vols. issued Stock. during year.

REPORT OF THE PUTNEY DIVISIONAL COMMITTEE, 1903-1904. IN presenting their report for the year ended 31st March, 1904, the Committee are glad to state that the various departments of the Library continue to be extensively used. The display of the advertisement sheets of the "Daily Telegraph," and the "Daily Chronicle," outside the Library in the morning, before the Library is opened has been greatly appreciated. The models of Cathedrals kindly lent by Sir G. Newnes, Bart., since the opening of the Library have been returned. The Committee most cordially thank Sir G. Newnes for the loan of the Models which proved of very great interest, not only to residents of Putney, but also to numerous students in various parts of London. The late Mr. A. W. Miles, of Rosslyn Tower, Putney, bequeathed to the Putney Library a legacy of £100, for the purchase of new books. This the Committee have expended in providing a large number of new books, and in purchasing 190 sheets of Ordnance Survey maps of England, one inch scale. The yard surrounding the Library has been tar-paved, to prevent the absorbtion of damp in the foundation walls of the building, at a cost of £27. In December, 1903, the Committee received with regret the resignation of Mr. C. F. Tweney, who had held the office of Librarian for 17 years. Mr. W. T. Bradley was appointed Librarian in March, 1904. The Committee are greatly indebted to their Chairman (the Rev. S. Todd) for the great interest he took in the supervision of the Library during the time that the office of Librarian was vacant. 11 A new and complete Catalogue of the Lending and Reference Libraries has just been issued, and the Committee trust that this will greatly aid the usefulness of the Library.

The books were examined and checked with the registers with the result that every volume, except three at the Tate Library, could be accounted for. It may be interesting to mention that since the opening of the libraries only twelve books, out of a circulation of over two and a half million volumes, have been unaccounted for at the annual stocktakings. Catalogues, etc.:— Considerable progress has been made with the work of cataloguing the contents of the libraries, and the card catalogues at the Balham and Tooting Libraries have been completed. To make the limited contents of the latter institution as useful as possible the books have been very fully indexed, and annotations descriptive of the scope of the works have been appended to the entries where thought desirable. Historical fiction has also received some attention, the period dealt with by the writer being briefly described under the author-entry. The usual lists of additions to the libraries have been issued at intervals during the year, as well as those relating to topics of the day and other matters of public and local interest. Reading Rooms: — The Reading Rooms have been largely attended during the year and their popularity and usefulness increased by the addition of several new papers and magazines. The Reading Rooms are open on week-days from 9 a.m. till 10 p.m., and on Sundays (except during the months of July, August, and September) from 3 till 9 p.m. Library Receipts: — The following is a statement of the receipts from the sale of catalogues, fines, etc., at the three libraries: — 26 £ s. d.

DIVISIONAL COMMITTEE. 1903-1904. Councillor J. LUSCOMBE (Chairman). The MAYOR (Councillor J. W. LORDEN, J.P.). Councillor Rev. D. TUDOR CRAIG, M.A. Councillor S. CRESSWELL, Councillor W. J. HARRISON. REV. W. REED, M.A. Rev. W. G. TARRANT, B.A. Mr. G. W. ECCLES. Mr. W. HICKS. Librarian: CECIL T. DAVIS. Librarian-in-Charge, Allfarthing Lane Branch Library: A. NASH. 36 Mandsmorth Public Libraries. ANNUAL REPORT. The steadily developing work of the Libraries in Wandsworth has been well maintained during the year under review. Councillor Harrison resigned the Chairmanship in November last and Councillor Luscombe was appointed in his stead; Councillor Littlechild also resigned and Councillor Rev. D. Tudor Craig, M.A., took his place, otherwise the constitution of the Committee remains unchanged. Consequent upon the widening of West Hill, a strip of the Library grounds has been added to the highway, and new iron railings and gates of a becoming pattern have been erected; the garden and entrance re-arranged. The plan and elevation of the new iron railing to be placed in front of the Library on West Hill by the Council were examined by the Committee and approved. These alterations have greatly improved the general frontage to the Council's property. During the alterations a temporary entrance was obtained by opening the side gate in Santos Road. The lighting at West Hill has been overhauled and as the Wenham System was commencing to shew signs of wear and inefficiency, the Surveyor was asked to submit estimates for lighting with gas and with electricity. After due consideration ventilating gaslights were adopted, and on the whole the work has been well and at the same time economically carried out. The Challenge Cups given by the Ex-Mayor (Councillor W. Hunt) and Mr. H. Payne, and won by members of the Wandsworth Borough Rifle Club have been exhibited during the year in the Longstaff Reading Room. 37 The Chairman (Councillor Harrison) and Rev. W. Reed, M.A., were appointed to attend the Summer Meeting of the University Extension Students held at Oxford as delegates of the Committee. The Commercial Union Assurance Co., supplied six fire buckets to West Hill, and six to the Allfarthing Lane Branch Library, free of cost to the Council. A notice board from the Emigrant's Information Office will probably soon be placed in the Allfarthing Lane Branch Library. Mr. W. T. Bradley, the Branch Librarian at Allfarthing Lane Branch Library, has been appointed Librarian-in-Charge at the Putney Library. He has been succeeded by Mr. A. Nash, SubLibrarian at Clapham Library. There has been no other change on the staff. The Committee was of opinion that a uniform scale of salary should be adopted; and after due consideration and adjustment such scale has been introduced by the Council, which will apply to all subordinate members of the staff. The Committee desires to place on record their appreciation of the zeal and earnestness with which the library staff have performed all the duties entrusted to them. During the year 501 new books have been purchased and 460 replacements made to the West Hill Library, and 286 and 110 respectively to the Allfarthing Lane Branch. The stock of books at West Hill Library now consists of 17,500 volumes, and at the Allfarthing Lane Branch 2,966 volumes. The number of readers' tickets available at West Hill on 31st March, 1904, was 2,650 as against 2,111 the previous year; at Allfarthing Lane Branch 1,995 as against 1,864 the previous year. The issue of books at West Hill has reached 54,904, an increase of 3,327 on that of 1903; and that at Allfarthing Lane Branch has been 39,899, an increase of 890. 38 The Committee beg to thank the following donors for gifts of books, etc., to the libraries: — To west Hill.—The British Museum, 12 volumes; Mrs. Carter, 4 volumes; Mr. East, 4 volumes ; London County Council, 2 volumes; Dr. Longstaff, several volumes; also Sir W.

To the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Sir, and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report of the health and sanitary condition of the Borough for the year 1903. Population. The population of the Borough for the year, estimated according to the methods adopted by the Registrar-General was, including public institutions, 256,292, compared with 245,803 in 1902, an increase of 11,489. Table I. shows the population of each sub-district, corrected and uncorrected, as well as that for the whole Borough. TABLE I. PARISH. Census 1901. Population estimated to the middle of 1903. Corrected. Uncorrected. CLAPHAM 51,361 53,477 53,203 PUTNEY 24,139 25,943 25,869 STREATHAM 71,658 80,010 80,560 TOOTING 16,473 21.758 23,464 WANDSWORTH 68,403 69,812 73,196 WHOLE BOROUGH 232,034 251,000 256,292 4 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The population estimated as above may be to some extent checked by another method of estimating it from the inhabited houses in the Borough. At the Census of 1901, the number of inhabited houses was 37,764, and the number of persons per inhabited house 6.1, while in 1902 the number increased to 40,423, and in 1903 to 42,531. If this last number be multiplied by 6.1 it gives as the population 259,439, an increase of 3,147 compared with the population as estimated by the first method. It is probable that this latter estimation is nearer the truth, as the increase in the number of new houses has been very great since the last Census. The public institutions in the Borough are as follows: — Clapham:—Hostel of God. Putnty:—The Priory, Roehampton. Streatham: —St. Anne's Home. (St. Pancras parish). Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum (part of). Tooting: —Tooting Home. Fairfield House. (Chelsea parish.) Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals— The Fountain and The Grove. Newlands Asylum. Tooting Bee Asylum. wandsworth:—The Workhouse. Royal Hospital for Incurables. Northlands Home for Incurables. Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum. H.M. Prison. One institution, the Tooting Bec Asylum, has been occupied during the year, and one, the Fountain Fever Hospital, is not at present in use. The total population of these institutions was about 6,300, but as a considerable number of the inmates of the Tooting Home, the Workhouse, and the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals belong to the Borough, a deduction of 5,292 made from the uncorrected total will give approximately the corrected population, viz.:—251,000, compared with 240,800 in 1902, and 228,702 in 1901. 5 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Births. During the 52 weeks ending the 2nd January, 1904, 6,722 births, 3,433 of males and 3,289 of females were registered, compared with 6,440 in 1902, and 6,107 in 1901. In Table II. is shown the number of births, males and females, the birth-rate, and the rates of natural increase for each parish, and for the whole Borough. TABLE II. Births. Rates. Sub-Districts. Males. Females. Total. Birth-Rate Rate of natural increase. Clapham 762 668 1,430 26.74 13.99 Putney 282 293 575 22.16 10.54 Streatham 896 834 1,730 21.62 10.80 Tooting 404 375 779 35.81 24.14 Wandsworth 1,089 1,119 2,208 31.62 17.70 Whole Borough 3,433 3,289 6,722 26.78 14.54 151 births occurred in the Wandsworth Workhouse, compared with 152 in 1902. Of these 68 belonged to Battersea, 6 to Clapham, 7 to Putney, 20 to Streatham, 12 to Tooting, and 38 to Wandsworth. The birth-rate for the year was 2678, an increase of .47 compared with 1902. The birth-rate if calculated on the uncorrected population was 26.22, .44 above last year and .45 above the rate for the previous ten years. The rate is the highest since 1893 when it was 27.07. The increase in the birth-rate is chiefly confined to the sub-districts of Tooting and Wandsworth, the rates there being respectively 35 81 and 31.62, and this is due to the large influx of working class population to these districts. The lowest rate occurred in the parish of Streatham where it was only 21.62 per 1,000, the actual number of births being 1,730 as against 1,742 in 1902. 6 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The birth-rate, as given on Table I. of the Local Government Board's Table, is calculated on the uncorrected population and is .56 lower than the rate calculated from the corrected population. The birth-rate for the whole of London was 28.28 per 1,000 compared with 28.36 in 1902, and for England and Wales 28.36 per 1,000 compared with 28.6 in 1902. The rate of natural increase, or the excess of births over deaths was 14.54 per 1,000, or if the rates on Table I. of the Local Government Board's Tables be used, 14.23, compared with 1185, the average for the last ten years. Deaths. During the year there were registered in the Borough 3,007 deaths, 1,480 of males and 1,527 of females, compared with 3,209 in 1902, 3,009 in 1901, and 3,142 in 1900. The number during 1903 was 408 below the corrected decennial average. The uncorrected death-rate was 1169, compared with 12.84 in 1902, 12.82 in 1901, and 13.62 the average for the preceding ten years. To ascertain the corrected death-rate corrections must be made to the above by the addition of the deaths in out-lying institutions of persons belonging to the Borough, and the subtraction of all deaths in public institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging thereto, whose domicile was in other parts of London. The total number of deaths corrected both for external and internal institutions was 3,073, compared with 3,304 in 1902, and 3,116 in 1901, and with 3,506, the average for the ten years preceding corrected for increase of population. During the year 443 deaths occurred in the public institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging to the Borough and 29 in other places (as Nursing Homes, the River Thames), not public institutions, making a total of 472, compared with 487 in 1902. Table III. shows these deaths arranged according to subdistricts, and Table IV. the deaths arranged according to causes of death, sex, age, and institution in which the death occurred. 7 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The number of deaths in the other institutions in the Borough remained much the same as in previous years. Table IV. shows also that the greater proportion of deaths in the Middlesex Asylum and the Tooting Bee Asylum occurred from Tuberculosis of the Lungs, Old Age, and all other causes, which include diseases of the nervous system; in the Hostel of God from Tuberculosis of the Lungs and Cancer; and in the Tooting Home from Tuberculosis of the Lungs and Old Age. It will also be seen that out of 66 deaths in the Fever Hospitals, 13 occurred from non-notifiable diseases. Table V. shows the number of deaths in public institutions in the Borough of persons belonging to the Borough arranged according to cause of death, sex, ages, and institution in which the death occurred. The total number of deaths was 130, 51 in the Fever Hospitals at Tooting, 69 in the Tooting Home, and 10 in other places. These deaths are in Table XII., allocated to the parishes to which they belong. The number of deaths given on Table IV., viz.:—472, and that on Table V., viz.:—130, make up the total of 602, the total number of deaths in public institutions in the Borough, as shown on Table XII. 10 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

As the Borough is dealt with as one Sanitary District the deaths of persons belonging to other Parishes in the Borough in institutions such as the Fever Hospitals, Tooting, are considered to be deaths in internal institutions with regard to the whole Borough, and are not included in the following Tables. The same applies to deaths in the Hostel of God, Clapham, and the Tooting Home. 12 Re-port of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE VI. DEATHS in Out-Lying Institutions, 1903.

The total number of deaths in out-lying institutions was 538, compared with 582 in 1902, and 543 in 1901. Of these 262 occurred in the Union Infirmary, 269 in General and Special Hospitals, and seven in the Fever Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. In 1902 there were 41 deaths in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals outside the Borough, of which 23 were in the Small-pox Hospital. It will be seen on Table V. the greater number of deaths from notifiable diseases occurred in the Fever Hospitals at Tooting, to which the majority of the patients in the Borough are removed. The total number of deaths after adding those on Table VI. and substracting those on Table IV. was 3,073, and the deathrate 12.24 per 1,000, compared with a corrected rate of 13 43 in 1902, and 15.33 in 1901. The next Table shows the total number of deaths in each suD-district and in the whole Borough corrected for institutions, as well as the corrected and uncorrected death-rates. The death-rate in the County of London for the year 1903 was 15.6 per 1,000, compared with 17.2 in 1902, and 17.1 in 1901. The death-rate in England and Wales during last year was 15.4 per 1,000, in the 76 great towns 16.3 per 1,000, and in the smaller towns 14.6 per 1,000. L 14 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

This factor has been ascertained to be 1,052 and if the corrected death-rate be multiplied by this it becomes 12.87 per 1,000, compared with 14.00 in 1902. In the various Boroughs of London the rates during the year were as follows, beginning with the lowest:— Borough. Population. Death-rate per 1,000. 1. Hampstead 85,197 9,87 2.

Finsbury 99,717 20.20 16 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In the separate sub-districts of this Borough the death-rate was highest in Wandsworth, 13.92 per 1,000, and lowest in Streatham, 10.82, but although the districts occupied the same positions in 1902, the rates were higher, viz.:—14.76 in Wandsworth, and 11.57 in Streatham. The rates in all the sub-districts are lower than they were in 1902, the greatest reduction having occurred in Putney, where the rate was 14.20 in 1902, and 11.52 in 1903. The rates on this Table do not agree with the rates on Table VIII., as the latter rates are calculated on the total population without deducting the population in institutions. Table VII. is a more correct statement of the number of deaths belonging to the Borough and also of the corrected deathrate. The chart shows the annual death-rate per 1,000 of population during each week of the year for the whole of London, and the annual death-rate for each fortnight for the Borough of Wandsworth. Only on one occasion was the death-rate in the Borough, viz.:—on the fortnight ending the 26th December, higher than the rate in London in the week ending the 26th December. During the rest of the year the rate was lower, and this is seen to have been very decided in the months of March, July, and September. Compared with the chart for the year 1902 the rate was higher in January, November, and December, and about the same in August, September, and October, but lower in the other months of the year. In the months of February and March the rate was much lower than in 1902. The reduction in these months was due to a decrease in the number of deaths from Epidemic Influenza, and also to the absence of any death from Small-pox. The curve for the whole of London shows that this was also lower in the months of February and March from the same causes. It will also be observed that there was no great increase in the rate during August and September, as would have been the case if the deaths from Diarrhœa had been equal to or above the average.

Death-Rate for London shown in Black, Death Rate for the Borough shown in Red. 17 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The next chart is one which has been inserted to show the great decrease in the death-rate which has taken place in London and in the Borough since the year 1854. Previous to the year 1883 the rate for the Borough is not absolutely correct, as no corrections have been made for the deaths in public institutions, and the curve should therefore be greater. In spite of this the curve shows a gradual descent until during the present year it has reached 12.24, the lowest ever recorded. On this chart also is shown the amount of rainfall as recorded at Greenwich. On several occasions, as in 1859, 1860, 1867, 1872, 1888, 1889, and 1894, a rainfall above the average coincided with a low deathrate but in no year has this been so marked as in 1903. The four Tables which follow are inserted by order of the Local Government Board. Table I. shows the births, birth-rate, deaths, and death-rate per 1,000 for the whole Borough for the year, and the ten preceding years; the total deaths of children under one year of age is also given, and the rate per 1,000 births registered. Table II. shows the population, the number of births and deaths registered, and the number of deaths under one year of age, for the whole Borough, as well as for the various sub-districts It also shows these for each year since 1891, and is to a large extent a complete history of the mortality of the Borough for the last ten years. Table III. shows the number of cases of infectious disease notified during the year at all ages and at certain age periods in the Borough and in the several sub-districts, and also shows the number of cases removed from each sub-district to Hospital. Table IV. is the general mortality Table for the whole Borough, showing the number of deaths at all ages, arranged as to cause of death. This also shows the total number of deaths in each sub-district, and the number of deaths in public institutions in the district, both of residents and non-residents. 18 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Infantile Death-Rate. The total number of deaths of infants under one year was 743, compared with 809 in 1902. Of these 153 occurred in Clapham, 73 in Putney, 186 in Streatham, 97 in Tooting, and 234 in Wandsworth. The infantile mortality per 1,000 births was 110, compared with 126 in 1902, 133 in 1901, and 143 in 1900. The following Table shows the number of deaths in each sub-district, the percentage to total deaths, and the rate per 1,000 births for the year 1903 and the three previous years, as well as the totals for the whole Borough. 24 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

It cannot be expected that the extremely low rate in 1903 will continue, but it is satisfactory to note that in a Borough of over 250,000 population the infantile mortality is 8 per 1,000 under the rate for the Rural districts of England and 22 per 1,000 under that for the whole of England and Wales. 25 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the total deaths occurring under one year, viz.:—743, 83 occurred from Zymotic diseases, excluding Diarrhoea, 142 from diseases of the digestive organs including Diarrhoea, 92 from diseases of the respiratory organs, 313 from Premature Birth and Developmental diseases, and the remainder, viz.:—113 from general diseases. The percentage of deaths from Premature Birth and Developmental diseases to total deaths under one year was 42.1, compared with 36.4 in 1902. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The next Table shows the number of deaths from these diseases during the year and for the ten previous years. This Table is corrected for institutions, as a large number of deaths registered in the Borough occurred in the Fountain and Grove Fever Hospitals, and belong to other Metropolitan Boroughs. The number above or below the corrected decennial average is also shown. TABLE XVI. 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 I898 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 1903 No. above corrected average.

This number is 101 under the number for 1902 and 66.8 below the corrected decennial average. Only three of the diseases, Measles, Whooping Cough, and Diarrhoea show an increase compared with last year, and three, Measles, Whooping Cough and other Zymotics, compared with the corrected decennial average. There were no deaths from Small-pox, and Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, and Influenza show a satisfactory decrease, especially noticeable in the case of Diphtheria. The death-rate per 1,000 from all these Zymotic diseases was 172 per 1,000, compared with 2.18 in 1902, 1.81 in 1901, and 2.12 in 1900. The death-rate from the principal Zymotic diseases, viz.:— Small-pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, and Diarrhoea was 1.49 per 1,000, compared with 1.68 in 1902 and 155 in 1901. The rate in London from these diseases was 1.77 per 1,000, compared with 2.21 in 1902. In out-lying institutions 32 deaths were registered as having been caused by these diseases, (13 belonging to Clapham, four to Putney, five to Streatham, three to Tooting, and seven to Wandsworth). In 1902, 69 deaths occurred, and in 1901 51, but in 1902 the number of deaths from Small-pox was the chief cause of the increase. Of these 15 occurred in the Union Infirmary, eight from Whooping Cough, three from Measles, three from Erysipelas, and one from other Septic diseases; ten in General and Special Hospitals, one from Whooping Cough, one from Diphtheria, one from Enteric Fever, one from Diarrhoea, one from Erysipelas, one from Puerperal Fever, and four from other Septic diseases; and seven in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, two from Scarlet Fever, four from Whooping Cough, and one from Croup. In internal institutions 55 deaths of persons not belonging to the Borough occurred in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 27 Asylums Board at Tooting, one from Measles, 21 from Scarlet Fever, 18 from Diphtheria, 13 from Enteric Fever, one from Diarrhoea, and one from other Septic diseases; one from Erysipelas in the Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum; and one from Influenza in the Tooting Home, a total of only 57, compared with 161 in 1902, and 188 in 1901. The number of deaths from these diseases belonging to the several sub-districts was 89 in Clapham, 44 in Putney, ill in Streatham, 44 in Tooting, and 146 in Wandsworth, a total of 434. 42 of these deaths occurred in the Fever Hospitals at Tooting, 14 from Scarlet Fever, 25 from Diphtheria, and three from Enteric Fever. The next Table shows the death-rate from these diseases, including Influenza, for the whole Borough and for the sub-districts for the year 1903, as well as for the ten previous years.

It is also .46 under the rate for 1902, and .66 under the average for the ten years proceeding. 28 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The rate in Clapham was .49 per 1,000 under last year and .99 under the decennial average; in Putney .06 and .37; in Streatham .38 and 44; in Tooting .51 and .53; and in Wandsworth .55 and .72. The rate was lowest in Streatham and highest in Wandsworth, but compared with the decennial average, Clapham shows the greatest reduction and Wandsworth the next. NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. The total number of certificates of cases of infectious diseases received during the year for the whole Borough and for the separate sub-districts is shown on Table III. of the Local Government Board's Tables. The number received in this Borough since the passing of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, is as follows:— TABLE XVIII. 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 Small-pox 4 ... 29 1 15 1 2 1 ... 4 34 127 30 Scarlatina 453 887 1256 673 659 983 1014 703 894 672 684 1063 835 Diphtheria 164 242 398 321 266 286 569 581 615 454 466 743 533 Membranous Croup 8 17 33 22 21 3 7 8 6 6 3 7 6 Typhus Fevers. 1 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

With the exception of Erysipelas, which shows a slight increase, all the notifiable diseases show a satisfactory decrease, especially in the cases of Small-pox, Scarlet Fever, and Diphtheria. 30 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Chicken-pox ceased to be a notifiable disease on the 7th January, but up to that date 60 cases had been notified. During the whole time the notification of this disease was in force, from the 7th February, 1902, 1,468 cases were notified. Excluding Chicken-pox, the total number of cases notified per 1,000 persons living was 67, compared with 9.5 in 1902, and 6.4 in 1901. In the several sub-districts the rates were as follows:— Clapham 6.2, compared with 9.5; Putney 6.3, compared with 5.6; Streatham 6.3, compared with 7.9; Tooting 6.3 compared with 13.9; Wandsworth 8.6, compared with 11.1. In the County of London this rate was 6.0, compared with 9.9 in 1902, and 8.8 in 1901. 19 cases of Scarlet Fever and 21 of Erysipelas were notified from the Workhouse; three cases of Scarlet Fever, two of Typhoid Fever, and two of Erysipelas from the Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum; one of Small-pox and one of Erysipelas from the Prison; seven of Erysipelas from the Tooting Home; one of Scarlet Fever from the Fountain Fever Hospital; and six of Scarlet Fever, six of Diphtheria, and one of Erysipelas from the Grove Fever Hospital; a total of 70, compared with 83 in 1902. SMALL-POX. In 1902 the last case of Small-pox was notified on the 31st July, and during the rest of the year the Borough was quite free from the disease. In 1903 the first two cases notified, one on the 27th January and the other on the 28th April, were found on examination at the South Wharf not to be suffering from Smallpox, and were returned home. The first actual case of Small-pox was notified on the 28th April, followed by four cases in May, four in June (one of which was not Small-pox), six in July (one of which was not Small-pox), two in October, seven in November, and two in December. Out of the 24 actual cases of Small-pox notified, seven occurred in Clapham, five in Streatham, six in Tooting, and six in Wandsworth. 31 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. One of the cases in Wandsworth was notified from H.M. Prison. In one house, five cases occurred; in two, three cases occurred in each; in one, two; and in 11, one case occurred in each. The following list gives the particulars of all the cases notified during the year: — (1). M.H., aged 26, of Trinity Road, Wandsworth. Notified on the 27th January. Returned home next day—not Smallpox. (2). R. M., aged 2¼, of St. James' Terrace, Wimbledon Road, Streatham. Notified on the 28th April. Returned home same day—not Small-pox. (3). H. H., aged 29, of Lower Orchard Street, Clapham. fied on the 28th April. I visited the premises and saw the patient before he was removed to hospital. He was a labourer out of work and had been travelling about Croydon and Mitcham seeking for work for three weeks. He was probably infected by a patient suffering from Small-pox while in either of these two districts. The patient's room was disinfected and cleansed, and as his wife had no proper accommodation at home, she was removed to the Council's Shelter at Larch Road. All the occupiers of the house were advised to be re-vaccinated, and seven out of the nine were re-vaccinated the same evening by the Public Vaccinator, the other two, however, refused to be done. (4). M. B., aged 40, of Hambro Road, Streatham. Notified on the 1st May. This patient contracted the disease at Wallington in Surrey from a boy who was removed to hospital suffering from Small-pox on the 14th April. The Medical Officer of Health for the Croydon Rural District had previously notified to me that the woman was a contact, but she refused to be re-vaccinated as her husband had conscientious objections. I visited the premises and advised the husband to be re-vaccinated, and this was done the same evening. (5). F. S., aged 24, of Gartmoor Gardens, Wandsworth. Notified on the 10th May. Patient was a laundress employed at a laundry in JBattersea. She was infected by a case removed 32 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. on the 28th April from Kamballa Road, Battersea. She. refused to be re-vaccinated on that date, but was re-vaccinated on the 1st May. All the other occupants of the house, five in number, were re-vaccinated. (6). W. S., aged 14, of Wardley Street, Wandsworth. Notified on the 18th May. Patient was a schoolboy, but assisted his father at a fruit stall. No definite history of infection could be ascertained, but he had been in Croydon selling fruit at his father's stall on the critical days. Great difficulty was experienced in persuading the contacts with this case to be re-vaccinated, but six out of the 11 contacts in the house were done, while one was a child under three years of age who had been vaccinated in infancy, and four other persons in contact with the case were also re-vaccinated. One contact, a schoolboy, who was in contact with the patient at the first onset of the illness had been re-vaccinated in 1902. The Shelter at the Putney Wharf was used by two adults and two children for two nights. (7). J. C., aged 30, inmate of H.M. Prison, Wandsworth. fied on the 25th May. Patient was lodging up to the 16th May at a Common Lodging House in North Holt Road, Roxeth, Harrow. The Medical Officer of Health for that district was informed of the case. (8). A. S., aged 7½, of Wardley Street, Wandsworth. Notified on the 31st May. Patient was infected by brother (Case No. 6) who was removed to hospital on the 18th May. Patient was not re-vaccinated until five days after exposure of infection. The Shelter at the Putney Wharf was used by two adults and one child from this house for three nights. (9). M. H., aged 5, of Lydden Grove, Wandsworth. Notified on the 16th June. Returned home same day—not Small-pox. (10). W. B., aged 39, of Glenburnie Road, Streatham. Notified on the 22nd June. Patient was a blacksmith employed in Balham High Road. No definite history of infection could be ascertained. He went by electric tram to Blackfriars on the 6th June and walked through the New Cut. He was probably infected by an unrecognised case in that neighbourhood. 33 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (11). J. P., aged 25, of Selkirk Road, Streatham. Notified on the 27th June. Patient was a bricklayer and was employed on a Board School at Tooting, but had only worked there for one week. No definite history of infection could be ascertained. On the day of presumed infection he was at work at a Builders and Contractors at Vauxhall, Lambeth. (12). A. B., aged 29, of Bucharest Road, Wandsworth. Notified on the 6th July. Patient was a school teacher at a school in Buckingham Palace Road, and was in the habit of travelling by tram from Clapham Junction every day. No definite history of infection could be ascertained. (13). T. J., aged 34, of Fontenoy Road, Streatham. Notified on the 9th July. Patient was a buyer for a firm of drapers in the West End. No definite history of infection could be ascertained. (14). H. J., aged 3, of St. Alphonsus Road, Clapham. Notified on the 9th July. On the 9th July I received a message from Dr. Hunter, of Clapham, that he had been attending two suspicious cases of Small-pox in St. Alphonsus Road. On visiting the premises the same evening I found that these cases were Small-pox. The children had never been vaccinated, and on further inquiry I elicited the fact that the father, 16 days before, had suffered from headache and backache, and also had had some spots on his face, body, and arms. On examination of the father I came to the conclusion that he had suffered from a mild attack of Small-pox and that he had infected the unvaccinated children. The father was a butcher by trade and had only been away from work one day; during the whole period the eruption was out he had been attending to his usual duties. I examined him carefully and came to the conclusion that he was practically free from infection, but as a precautionary measure I ordered him to stay in one room so that I could keep him under observation two or three days longer. All the occupants of the house, but one, were re-vaccinated on the evening of the 9th. A younger brother of the father who resided in the same house had a few spots on his face and he was also kept under 34 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. tion, but on further examination I decided that he had not had Small-pox. No history could be obtained from the father as to how he contracted the disease. (16). H. J., aged 5, of St. Alphonsus Road, Clapham. Notified on the 9th July. Patient was infected by his father—an unrecognised case. (17). W. D., aged 29, Alphonsus Road, Clapham. Notified on the 25th July. Patient was a painter, but was out of work at the time of falling ill. He was infected by previous cases in same house (Nos. 15 and 16). He refused re-vaccination at that time. (18). J. G., aged 62, of Balham High Road. Notified on the 26th October. No history of infection could be ascertained Patient had not been out of the house since the 4th October. (19). G. C., aged 33, of Letchworth Street, Tooting. Notified on the 29th October. No history of infection could be ascertained. Patient was a salesman at the Central Meat Market, Smithfield, and travelled to and from his work night and morning. (20). M. W., aged 7, of Clifton Street, Clapham. Notified on the 2nd November. Returned home—hot Small-pox. For further history see cases Nos. 27 and 28. (21) F. C., aged 11, of Letchworth Street, Tooting. Notified on the 7th November. Patient was an unvaccinated child. Infected by father (Case No. 19). All the inmates of the house refused to be re-vaccinated on the occurrence of the first case. (22). A. W., aged 7, of Garratt Lane, Tooting. Notified on the 9th November. This case had been in contact with Case No. 19 and was infected by him. The fact that the child had been in contact with that case was concealed. (23). F. C., aged 33, of Letchworth Street, Tooting. Notified on the nth November. Infected by husband (Case No. 19.) She refused to be re-vaccinated when first case occurred. (24). J. J., aged 43, of Letchworth Street, Tooting. Notified on the nth November. Infected by Case No. 19. Patient refused re-vaccination at that time, 35 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (25). R. J., aged 54, of Letchworth Street, Tooting. Notified on the nth November. Infected by Case No. 19. Patient refused re-vaccination at that time. (26). A. I., aged 58, of Atheldene Road, Wandsworth. Notified on the 27th November. No history of infection could be ascertained. Patient must have been infected on the 9th November either in the train or in the street when she went to Westminster to see the Lord Mayor's Show. (27 & 28). The following cases were the subject of a special report:— W. W., aged 2, and A. W., aged 4, notified on the 24th December were infected by previous cases in the same house. The history is extremely interesting and instructive, and once more shows the powerful effect of vaccination, and the difficulties which occasionally arise in diagnosis. On the 31st October, M. W. (Case No. 20), aged 7, was removed as suffering from Small-pox to the South Wharf, Rotherhithe, and was returned home the next day as not having Small-pox. The notification, signed by Miss Cameron, M.B., was received by me on the 2nd November. This child had not been vaccinated in infancy, but was vaccinated by the Medical Superintendent at the South Wharf. I instructed the Sanitary Inspector to call, and to inform me if the vaccination was successful, and on the tenth day it was reported to me as a successful vaccination, and the usual notification was sent to the South Wharf. The parents were at that time strongly urged to have the children vaccinated, but they refused. There were two families in this house, one upstairs and one downstairs, and the following list shows their sex, ages, and condition as to vaccination: — UPSTAIRS—(1). Male, aged 33, vaccinated in infancy. (2). Female, aged 27, vaccinated in infancy, and re-vaccinated in childhood. (3). Female, aged 7, unvaccinated in fancy, vaccinated at South Wharf. (4). Female, aged 5, unvaccinated in fancy. 36 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (5). Female, aged 4, unvaccinated in fancy. (6). Female, aged 2, unvaccinated in fancy. (7). Female, aged 1, vaccinated. DOWNSTAIRS—(1). Male, aged 33, vaccinated in infancy. and re-vaccinated several times in adult life. (2). Female, aged 32, had Small-pox when 8 years of age. (3). Male, aged 6, vaccinated in infancy. (4). Female, aged 4, vaccinated in infancy. (5). Female, aged 1¼, vaccinated. On Tuesday, the 8th December, owing to information received from a medical practitioner in Lambeth, I visited the premises with Dr. Atkinson, and examined M. W. and A. W. We found both suffering from an illness resembling Small-pox. In the case of M. W. only a few spots were visible and these were very indefinite. The eruption in A. W. was like Small-pox, but in view of the history of the previous case we did not consider it justifiable, without further examination, to notify the cases as Small-pox. The first symptoms in the case of the father were stated to have arisen on the 26th November, and in the case of the child on the 28th November. The other children were advised to be vaccinated, but the parents would not consent. I took the opportunity of examining M. W., the case notified on the 2nd November, and found that the scars left were very distinct and pitted, more like those left by Small-pox than by Chicken-pox eruption. The cases were kept under observation and confined to the room, the medical attendant promising to report to me if any further development occurred. On the 23rd December I was informed by him that the two remaining unvaccinated children, W. and A., were suffering from Confluent Small-pox. They were at once removed to hospital, the whole house, bedding and personal clothing disinfected, and the rooms were afterwards thoroughly cleansed. 37 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Further inquiry elicited the fact that the mother had had one or two spots, but had not been confined to her bed as she was not feeling ill. The only one who has escaped was the infant of one year, who had been vaccinated a few months before. It is most fortunate that the occupants of the rooms downstairs were protected by vaccination as otherwise they would have undoubtedly taken the disease. I have no doubt, in reviewing the whole history, that the case originally notified as Small-pox was really Smallpox and not Chicken-pox, and that Miss Cameron's diagnosis was the correct one. It is difficult to understand how this first case was infected as no cases of Small-pox have been notified to me from that neighbourhood since July, 1902. The W. family had only recently removed to this Borough, having previously resided in Lambeth. Of the 24 cases of Small-pox, in 14 the patients had been vaccinated in infancy only, in nine they were unvaccinated, and in the one that occurred in the Prison no information as to the condition of the patient with respect to vaccination was obtained. Of the 14 who had been vaccinated in infancy, five were from 25 to 30 years of age; three, 30 to 35; one, 35 to 40; and five over 40 years of age. Of the nine unvaccinated, three were from one to five years, four from five to ten, and two from ten to 15 years of age. No case occurred in a person under 20 who had been vaccinated in infancy. 14 of the cases were primary or first cases in the house, and with the exception of one, all were infected in some other part of London. The one exception was the case in Garratt Lane, Tooting, which was infected by the first case in Letchworth Street. Ten cases were subsequent to other cases, four of these being infected by unrecognised cases in the house, the remaining six refused re-vaccination when the primary case occurred. 38 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. All the subsequent cases occurred on or about the fourteenth day of exposure to infection, and in no instance could the infection have been due to any delay or neglect in disinfection. A few contacts were forwarded by Medical Officers of Health of other Boroughs in London, and these were visited and vaccination advised. The names and addresses of 23 contacts belonging to other Boroughs were forwarded to the Medical Officer of Health of the respective Boroughs. It is only necessary to call special attention to the cases occurring in Letch worth Street, Tooting, and Clifton Street, Clapham. In the Letchworth Street cases all the contacts refused revaccination, and all were attacked by the disease. In the cases in Clifton Street the case returned from the South Wharf as net being Small-pox was, in my opinion, the cause of the other cases, three of which were unrecognised and not notified. The only one of the family who escaped was a vaccinated infant, and this infant slept in the same room as the two cases last notified. Shelters. The two shelters at Putney and Balham again proved of great service on the few occasions it was found necessary to utilise them. The Putney Shelter was used on four occasions by seven adults and six children for four nights, and the Balham Shelter on one occasion by one adult for three nights. VACCINATION. Table XX. is taken from the official returns of the Vaccination Officers to the Guardians for the year 1902. It shows the number of births, the number of children successfully vaccinated for the whole Borough as well as for the separate sub-districts. Streatham, Balham, and Tooting are included under the heading of Streatham. 39 Report of the Medical Officer of Health, TABLE XX. Sub-Districts.

The increase, although slight, is satisfactory, and is the highest recorded since 1894, when the percentage was 75.8. The next Table shows the percentage of children vaccinated to total births registered in the Borough, and for the vaccination sub-districts for the year 1902 as well as for the ten years preceding. The average for the ten years 1892 to 1901 is also given. The percentage of successful vaccinations for the year 1902 is shown to have been 1.9 above the average of the previous ten years, Clapham being the same, Putney an increase of 14.6 per cent., Streatham a decrease of 2.7 per cent., and Wandsworth an increase of 5.3 per cent., compared with the average for the preceding ten years. Clapham and Streatham are under, and Putney and Wandsworth above the average. One reason why Streatham shows such a bad record is due to the large influx of working class people from other parts of London, chiefly the East End, to parts of Tooting and Balham. Occasional inquiries in these districts showed that there are a large number of unvaccinated children, and these are a distinct danger to the health of the other inhabitants of these parts of the Borough. 40 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. I had anticipated a much greater increase in the number of infantile vaccinations, but these anticipations have only been realised in the cases of Putney and Wandsworth. 533, or 8.4 per cent, died unvaccinated. In 84 cases certificates of conscientious objections were obtained, compared with 90 in 1901. 105 were postponed by medical certificates, 101 had removed to districts the vaccination officer of which was duly notified and 298 had removed to places unknown and could not be traced.

SCARLET FEVER. 822 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified during the year, compared with 1,063 in 1902, 684 in 1901, and 672 in 1900. 158 of these were notified from Clapham, 100 from Putney, 192 from Streatham, 71 from Tooting, and 301 from Wandsworth. The total number of deaths was 18, six in Clapham, two in Putney, two in Streatham, one in Tooting, and seven in Wandsworth. 642 of the cases, or 78'1 per cent., were removed to hospital where 16 died, and 180, or 2i'9 per cent, were kept at home with two deaths. The percentage of cases removed to hospital is above that of last year and the year previous, the numbers being 75 per cent, in 1902 and 70.6 per cent, in 1901. 41 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The case fatality during the year was 2.19 per cent., slightly under the rate for 1902. The fatality among cases treated in hospital was 2.49 per cent., and among those treated at home 1.1 per cent., or less than half. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was 3.2, compared with 4.4 in 1902 and 2.91 in 1901, and in the County of London 27, compared with 3.8. The number of cases notified in this Borough was thus .5 per cent. above the same rate for the whole of London. In the separate sub-districts the annual rate of notified cases per 1,000 persons living was as follows for the year and for the three previous years: — TABLE XXII.

There was no special outbreak in Putney to account for this increase, cases having occurred during every month of the year and in different parts of the parish. The whole of the cases were of an exceedingly mild type, only two deaths occurring out of the 100 cases notified. The rates in the other sub-districts are decidedly under that for last year, Tooting showing a reduction from 6.6 to 3.0 per 1,000. The death-rate per 1,000 living was .07, compared with .09 in 1902, and .06 in 1901, while the rate for the whole of London was .07, compared with .12 in 1902. 42 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The chart shows that there were three maxima, one in January, one in May, and the other in September and October, but only on one occasion did the number of notifications exceed 30 per week, while in 1901 this number was exceeded several times. The smallest number of notifications was received during the week ending the 19th December, only four cases having been notified. The prevalence of Scarlet Fever was again due to the fact that a large proportion of the cases was not diagnosed till desquamation was noticed, and consequently no precautions were taken by the parents. The average number of notifications per week was about 16, compared with 20 in 1902. During 26 weeks the notifications were either at or above this average, and during 26 weeks they were under this average. The only outbreak calling for special notice occurred in September and October, the particulars of which were laid before the Public Health Committee. This outbreak was, in my opinion, due to the milk supply to one purveyor, and it was of special interest, as although no definite source of infection could be found either in this Borough or at the farm from which the milk was delivered, yet the withdrawal of the milk from one particular farm at once stopped the outbreak. At the expiration of 14 days the milk supply from the farm was again supplied and again cases occurred. The milk was then Pasteurised by the dairyman and the outbreak again ceased. The particulars of the cases reported to the Committee were as follows: — The first case was notified in the last week of August, followed by another on the 1st September, one on the 2nd, two on the 5 th, five on the 7th, and one on the 9th. Inquiries were made in each case as to the possible source of infection, and when five cases were notified on the 7th it was seen that all the houses in which the cases occurred had only one thing in common, viz.:—the milk supply. Chart showing the number of notifications of Scarlet Fever received during each week of the year 1903. 43 Re-port of the Medical Officer of Health. Three of the cases were in adults and eight in children, and as none of the families were personally acquainted with one another suspicion was at once directed to the supply of milk. I visited the milk shop on the 8th September and had a personal interview with the proprietor. The families affected were supplied by seven different men in his employ, and these men were, and had been for some time, in good health, nor was there any illness among their families, or in the houses in which they resided. I ascertained the names and addresses of the farms from which the milk was derived, and I at once communicated with the Medical Officers of Health of the districts in which the farms were situated, asking them to make inquiries and inform me at once. In the meantime, however, the proprietor of the milkshop, on his own initiative, visited the farms, four in number, and found that on three of them there had been no illness of an infectious nature among the farm employees, or in the neighbourhood for years. At the fourth farm it was ascertained that a lad employed by the farmer had been sent home on the 3rd September as he had informed the farmer that his sister had Scarlet Fever. This case was the probable cause of the outbreak in this Borough, although nothing further could be ascertained as to any other cases in the neighbourhood, or as to any direct connection between the case and the farm. The case was not removed to an isolation hospital, but treated at home. The brother did not milk the cows, but attended to the refrigerator, and as the amount of milk sent from the farm was small, the number of cases occurring was also small. I advised the milk dealer to cease taking milk from that particular farm for a week and this he consented to do and advised the farmer accordingly. The supply of milk was resumed on the 16th September, on the 25th other two cases were notified, followed by three on the 28th, two on the 29th, and two on the 30th. I advised the milk seller to Pasteurise this milk, keeping it separate from the other supplies, and as a consequence no further cases occurred. 44 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. All the cases were of an extremely mild type and no deaths resulted. It was not considered advisable to take action under section 71 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, as although there was strong presumptive evidence that the Scarlet Fever was caused by the milk it could not be definitely proved. The dairyman was also quite willing and anxious to do all in his power to prevent any spread of the disease. The above section could not have been put in action for several days, and with his co-operation the milk supply was withdrawn much more quickly DIPHTHERIA AND MEMBRANOUS CROUP. These diseases were not nearly so prevalent in 1903 as in the previous year, only 532 cases having been notified, compared with 750 in 1902. Although less than last year the number of cases is above the two years 1900 and 1901, but it is 91 under the decennial average corrected for increase of population. The greatest number of notifications was received from the parish of Streatham and the smallest number from Tooting. 401, or 75 per cent. of the cases were removed to hospital where 30 died, and 131, or 25 per cent. were treated at home with 15 deaths. The case mortality was 8.4 per cent., compared with 9.3 in 1902 and 8.9 in 1901. The case mortality for all London was 9.7 per cent., compared with 10.7 in 1902 and 10.9 in 1901. The case mortality among the hospital treated cases was 7.5 per cent, and among those treated at home 11.4 per cent. The following Table shows the number of cases, the caserate per 1,000 living for the year, and for the previous ten years, the deaths, and the death-rate for the Borough, as well as for each sub-district.

A comparison of the rate for the separate sub-districts shows that the highest rate was in the parish of Streatham, and this parish also had a rate in excess of the year 1902 and the ten years 1892-1901, while all the other sub-districts, notably Wandsworth and Tooting, show a considerable reduction. Compared with the whole of London the case-rate is .44 higher, but it is lower than the rate for the whole of London for the years 1892-1901. The death-rate is very low and compares most favourably with last year and with the previous decennium. The rate was only .18 per 1,000, varying from .05 in Clapham to .30 in Streatham. With the exception of Streatham the rates in 1903 for all the other sub-districts were lower than in the previous year. The chart shows the number of cases notified during each week of the year. The largest number of cases notified in one week was in the month of February, and this was due largely to a slight recrudescence of the outbreak on the Hyde Farm estate, Clapham, which was specially commented on in the report for the year 1902. The increase in July was due to the number of cases occurring in South Streatham, principally attending Eardley Road school, 46 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. and this was also the cause of the increase in October and November. There was no special outbreak calling for notice during the year, with the exception of the cases occurring in South Streatham, and these were due largely to unrecognised cases attending school while in an infective condition. The attention of the Medical Officer to the London School Board was called to the prevalence of the disease in the school, and swabs were taken from the throats of several children, chiefly in the Infants' Department, with the result that several cases of the disease were discovered and at once isolated. The Hyde Farm estate was almost free from the disease after the month of February and as a consequence the number of cases attending the schools in that district largely decreased. The following Table shows the number of cases of Diphtheria and their relationship to the schools in the Borough. The total number of cases in the Table does not coincide with the total number in the Local Government Board's Table, as correction has been made for errors in diagnosis. The largest proportion of cases occurred among children attending Eardley Road School, South Streatham, the cases occurring in every month of the year except April, and particularly in the last four months of the year. In Table III. of the Local Government Board's Tables it will be noted that 281, or 52.8, per cent., occurred at ages five to 15, and 168, or 31.5 per cent., under five years of age. It was not thought necessary to close the Infants' Department of Eardley Road School, but a careful inspection and examination of the children was made by the Medical Officer to the London School Board, and the class-rooms were thoroughly disinfected in the month of December. There was no special reason why cases should have been more numerous at this school than at any of the other schools in the neighbourhood, except that in addition to the unrecognised cases, the new property has been erected on soil much the same, as regards organic matter, as the soil on the Hyde Farm estate. The following Table shows the number of cases of Diphtheria and their relationship to the schools attended by the patients, as well as the number occurring during each month of the year. 47 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Of the 532 cases notified, in 50 information was received that the diagnosis was incorrect, and only 482 actual cases are shown in the Table. Of the 482, 216, or 44.8 per cent., did not attend school, leaving 266, or 55.2 per cent., cases occurring among children attending school. Return cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. 50 cases of Scarlet Fever and 11 of Diphtheria occurred after the return of cases from the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, compared with 48 of Scarlet Fever and eight of Diphtheria in 1902, and 19 of Scarlet Fever and five of Diphtheria in 1901. Eight of the cases of Scarlet Fever occurred in Clapham, nine in Putney, two in Streatham, nine in Tooting, and 22 in Wandsworth. Of the cases of Diphtheria, eight occurred in Streatham and three in Wandsworth. Four of the cases of Scarlet Fever occurred in one house in Clapham, and four in one house in Wandsworth, three in one house in Putney, three in one house in Tooting, two in one house in Putney, and two in three houses in Wandsworth, the rest, viz.: — 28, being single cases. Two cases of Diphtheria occurred in one house in Streatham, and two in one house in Wandsworth. The following Tables show the date of removal to hospital of the first case, the date of return from hospital, the number of days the first case was in hospital, and the date of the first symptoms of the subsequent cases. The average duration of isolation in hospital in the case of Scarlet Fever was 54 days, varying from a minimum of 29 days to a maximum of 101 days, and in the case of Diphtheria from a minimum of 31 days to a maximum of 102 days. In the case of Scarlet Fever it was noted by the parents that the child on return from hospital had a discharge from nose or ear 49 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. in nine cases, and was desquamating in six cases, that is, of the 36 households affected, in 15 cases the parents observed some cause which might have been the source of the infection of the subsequent cases. In the case of Diphtheria nothing was noted by the parents, but this could hardly be expected as the child on return may have the bacillus present without any actual clinical symptoms. In many of the cases there was little doubt that the nasal discharge was the cause of the subsequent cases, but in some of the cases stated to be desquamating a careful examination was made but no desquamation could be detected. My visits, however, were generally made some days after the case had been returned, but the statements of the parents were quite bond fide, and I had no reason to doubt their accuracy. The report of the medical man appointed by the Metropolitan Asylums Board has not been received, but I am of opinion that it would be wiser on the part of the Metropolitan Asylums Board Authorities to keep suspicious cases a few days longer in the hospital rather than run the risk of spreading the disease. In several of the cases in this Borough it has been a most serious thing for the parents, and I understand that in two of the cases representations were made by them to the Metropolitan Asylums Board. In the Tables is also given the number of days elapsing between the return home of the case from hospital and the first symptoms of the subsequent case, but in a large proportion of the cases the patients were not permitted to mix with the other children after returning for some days. This accounts for the marked difference in the number of days elapsing before the subsequent cases occurred. 50 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. SCARLET FEVER. TABLE XXV. Parish.

ENTERIC FEVER. 105 cases of Enteric Fever were notified during the year, 24 from Clapham, 10 from Putney, 21 from Streatham, six from Tooting, and 44 from Wandsworth. 66 of the cases were removed to hospital where five died and 39 were treated at home with 14 deaths. The total number of deaths was 19, compared with 30 in 1902, and 15 in 1901. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 population was .41 compared with .57 in 1902, and 50 for the whole of London. The case mortality was 18 per cent. for the Borough, and 16.9 per cent. for the whole of London. The corrected death-rate from fever was .07 per 1,000, compared with .12 in 1902, .o6 in 1901, and .12 in 1900. The deathrate from fever for the whole of London was .o8 per 1,000. The number of cases notified in each sub-district, as also the number of deaths is given in the Tables. The death-rate for the different sub-districts was as follows:— Clapham .09, Putney .03, Streatham .03, Tooting .18 and Wandsworth .o8 per 1,ooo. Of the 66 cases removed to hospital 18 were reported, on further examination, not to be suffering from the disease, leaving 48 actual cases with five deaths, while of the 39 cases kept at home no information was received as to correctness of diagnosis, but the proportion of deaths was much higher. Special inquiry has been made as to the causation of all the cases notified, and it was ascertained that out of the 87 actual cases 12 were, in all probability caused by eating infected oysters, seven by mussels, two by cockles, one by winkles, while in eight cases the patients were in the habit of eating watercress. In one case the patient had ice-cream a fortnight before the onset of the disease. In another case the patient contracted the disease at Cape Town, and in two cases the disease was contracted at seaside resorts, while in 53 no definite history of infection could be ascertained. The following particulars with reference to cases due to eating infected oysters are not so complete as they might have Chart showing the number of Notifications of Enteric Fever received during each week of the year 1903. 53 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. been, but it was difficult to obtain definite information in many of the cases as to date and place of purchase. (1). A. C., notified on the 7th January, had some oysters on 7th or the 8th December, 1902, and the first symptoms were observed on the 26th December. No information could be obtained as to where the oysters were purchased. This case proved fatal on the 16th January. (2). G. R., notified on the 9th January, first symptoms on the 30th December. Partook of oysters on the 9th December at home, and on the 11 th December at the Trocadero Restaurant. The oysters were obtained from a local dealer who purchased them in Lower Thames Street. I communicated these facts to the Medical Officer of Health to the City, who informed me that the oysters purchased on the gth December by the patient came from Whitstable and that seven samples of Whitstable oysters, one from this very bed, had been examined by Dr. Klein and none showed evidence of sewage pollution. It is, however, quite possible that the oysters actually taken by the patient were polluted, as later in the year oysters from the same dealer (Cases Nos. 11 and 12) were again examined and found to be polluted. (3). M. C., notified on the 14th January, first symptoms on the 27th December. Patient had raw oysters about three weeks before the onset of first symptoms. (4) J. R., notified on the 14th January, first symptoms on the 29th December. Patient had oysters a week before Christmas, but no further information could be obtained. (5). T. C., notified on the 18th March, first symptoms about the 10th March. Patient had some oysters on the 21st February. This case proved fatal on the 19th March. (6). A. P., notified on the 19th May, first symptoms about the 1st May. Patient was a regular eater of oysters. The oysters had been purchased by a local dealer at Billingsgate Market. The particulars were forwarded to the Medical Officer of Health to the City of London. (7). A. S., notified on the 16th June, first symptoms about the 24th May. Patient had oysters at a restaurant in Regent Street on the 9th May. 54 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (8). W. T., notified on the 14th September. The patient was manager to a fishmonger in Fulham and frequently had oysters. The Medical Officer of Health for Fulham informed me that the oysters had been obtained from a large dealer at Billingsgate. The Medical Officer for the City of London was informed and in his report on the matter he states that the oysters sold by this firm were from layings that had been examined in January and March and had been found free from infection and it was not at that time considered necessary to make any further investigation. He further reported that on the 2nd December a case of Enteric Fever occurred at Hastings and was attributed to oysters purchased from the above dealer. Five samples were purchased from him on the 3rd December and in each sample purchased, some of the oysters contained the bacillus coli communis. The oysters purchased by the official of the City were large American Blue Points, not re-laid; South American not re-laid; small Dutch, not re-laid ; Burnham and Whitstable Prncesses. (9). H. M., notified on the 28th September, first symptoms on the 21 st. This patient had oysters at Southend-on-Sea on the 4th September. (10). G.O., notified on the 5th October, first symptoms on the 26th September. This patient was employed as a fishmonger and occasionally had oysters, but no definite history could be obtained as the patient was only a lodger and the other occupiers could give no further information (11). C. L., notified on the Qth December, first symptoms on the 20th November. Patient had oysters about a fortnight previous, purchased from a local dealer. (12). C. W., notified on the 11th December, first symptoms on the 22nd November. Patient was a regular eater of oysters and purchased them from a local dealer. These two last cases were the subject of special inquiry and it was ascertained that both the local dealers, one in Balham and the other in Putney, obtained their supplies from the same wholesale dealer at Billingsgate. The particulars of the first of the two cases were sent to the Medical Officer of Health to the City who purchased a sample of 55 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. oysters stated to be the same kind as those supplied to the local dealers. The oysters were known as Gann's Princesses and came from the Pollard bed at Whitstable. The sample was examined by Dr. Klein who reported that the oysters were distinctly sewage polluted and unsafe for consumption. The particulars of the second case were also sent to the Medical Officer of Health to the City, who purchased another sample and these also on being examined by Dr. Klein were reported to be decidedly polluted. The Medical Officer of Health for the City then seized 100 oysters at the dealers in Lower Thames Street and took them to the Mansion House to obtain an order for their condemnation. The oysters were examined by Dr. Klein and found to be polluted and an order was made for their condemnation. These two last cases had partaken of oysters from the same source as Case 2, but in that case, as reported, no action was at the time taken. The seven cases in which mussels were suspected were also the subject of special inquiry, and the following are the particulars of each case: — (1). G. B., notified on the 26th October, first symptoms a week previous. Patient was in France at a seaside resort during the month of September and had raw mussels which were collected on the beach. (2). J. N., notified on the 29th October, first symptoms on the 15th October. Patient had mussels about a fortnight previous to the onset of the illness. (3). L. B., notified on the 7th December, first symptoms about the 16th November. Patient had a quart of mussels, stated to be cooked, from an itinerant street vendor. (4). G. G., notified on the 18th December, first symptoms on the 4th December. Patient had mussels about a fortnight previous to the onset of the disease. These had been purchased at a shop in Manchester where the patient was at that time residing. (5). W. F., notified on the 21st December, first symptoms about six weeks previous. Patient partook of mussels about a fortnight before the first symptoms appeared. 56 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (6&7). A. V., notified on the 21st December, and R.V., notified on the 28th. These patients both had mussels, in the one case about a week before, and in the other case a fortnight before the onset of the illness. The mussels in the last three cases were purchased from local dealers who obtained their supplies from Billingsgate Market, and the Medical Officer of Health for the City, who was communicated with, informed me that the mussels in each instance came from layings at Hadleigh Bay, Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. Samples were submitted to Dr. Klein and he reported that the mussels were dirty outside and inside, and that they were decidedly polluted. Of the two cases attributed to cockles, and the one to winkles, no definite information could be obtained as to the source of the shell-fish, but in all three cases the symptoms of the disease appeared about a fortnight after eating the shell-fish The question of contamination of shellfish by sewage has been dealt with by the Royal Commission on Sewage Treatment in their report issued in December, 1903. The Commission states that the evil is sufficiently grave to demand a remedy and the report states that the only way to deal with the evil is to place tidal waters under the influence of some competent authority, and confer on that authority the power to prevent the taking of shell-fish for human consumption from any position in which they are liable to dangerous contamination They propose that the Rivers Board should be the authority, subject to an appeal to the Central Authority, and that the Central Authority should be a new department under the Local Government Board. The question of foreign shell-fish is also dealt with and it is recommended that a guarantee should be required from each Government "that all oysters and other shell-fish imported into "this country for human consumption have been procured from "locations where they were not liable to be contaminated by " sewage or other objectionable filth." It is to be hoped that the Government will take early action in this matter as until legislation is made nothing can be done to stop the exposure for sale of oysters from polluted layings. 57 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In eight cases the patients partook of watercress shortly before the onset of the illness, but only in two was it possible to trace the source of the watercress. The probability of infection by eating watercress is not great, but examination of one source in the neighbourhood shows that such cause of infection is not impossible. The chart shows the number of cases notified in each week during the year. The following report was made to the Council with regard to the sale in this Borough of a number of Army blankets which had been returned from South Africa : — On the 22nd May I received a communication from the Medical Officer of Health for the City of London, stating that a certain number of Army blankets had been sold to a dealer in this Borough. I instructed the Sanitary Inspectors to visit all places of business in the Borough where such goods were likely to be kept, and this was done the same day. In three places Army blankets were found and these were at once sent to the Disinfecting Station, disinfected by steam, and returned to the owners. One dealer, however, had disposed of a considerable number outside the Borough, a few having been purchased by emigrants to Canada. Information was sent to the Authorities of the places in England, and the Agent-General for Canada was also informed. In the course of the inquiries one of the Inspectors ascertained that one of the dealers, although he had only purchased one blanket, had also purchased about one hundred india-rubber ground sheets, 47 of which were still in his possession, the rest having been sold to supposed emigrants to Canada. These 47 sheets were examined, and found to be in a very dirty condition, all being very badly stained, the stains having been caused by blood or other discharges. I examined the whole of the 47 sheets myself at the Disinfecting Station, and considered that nothing short of total destruction would be satisfactory. The owner expressed his willingness to have these destroyed, and this was accordingly done. These india-rubber sheets were no doubt used in hospitals in South Africa, as on 25 of them the names, and in many instances the regiment, were written. A copy of these names were taken in case of further inquiry. 58 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Cases of Mistaken Diagnosis. During the year information was received from the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board that the patients removed to hospital were not suffering from the disease notified, or any other notifiable disease in 106 cases, compared with only 41 cases in 1902. Of the cases treated at home no information was available • whether the diagnosis was correct or not. Of 1,109 cases of Diphtheria, Scarlet Fever, and Enteric Fever removed to hospital, the diagnosis in 106, or 9.5 per cent., was incorrect. This is a very large increase compared with the previous year when the percentage was only 2.8. Enteric Fever shows a much higher percentage than the other two diseases and this is also much higher than it was in 1902. The percentage in Diphtheria has increased from 2 3 in 1902 to 12.4 in 1903, but this is, to some extent, due to the fact that, acting on my advice, many practitioners notified cases of suspicious sore throat as Diphtheria. In 1902 77 per cent. of the total admissions to hospital were found not to be suffering from the disease mentioned in the medical certificate. The percentage of Scarlet Fever was, in London in 1902, 47, and in this Borough 5.9 in 1903; of Diphtheria1I3.5 and 12.4, and of Enteric Fever 21.2 and 27.2. TABLE XXVI. Disease.

Bacteriological Examinations. During the year 125 bacteriological examinations were made, compared with 78 in 1902, 66 in 1901, 44 in 1900, and 29 in 1899. T A BLE. XXVII. Clapham. Putney. Streatham.

Puerperal Fever. 13 cases of the above disease were notified, compared with 21 in 1902. Three of the cases occurred in Clapham, one in Putney, two in Streatham, one in Tooting, and six in Wandsworth. Six of the cases, or 46.1 per cent. were fatal, two in Clapham, two in Putney, one in Streatham, and one in Wandsworth. One of the deaths in Putney occurred in an outlying institution and was not notified from that institution. Five out of the 13 cases notified were removed to the Union fnfirmary where three died, and one died in a General Hospital. The death-rate was .024, compared with .033 in 1902. In all the notified cases the house was thoroughly disinfected, and the nurse in attendance was warned not to attend any other cases of childbirth for a specified period, varying in each case. 60 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Erysipelas. 232 notifications were received and five deaths occurred, compared with 236 notifications and 18 deaths in 1902. Measles. The total number of deaths due to the above disease was 109,66 of males and 43 of females. 18 occurred in Clapham, seven in Putney, 26 in Streatham, eight in Tooting, and 50 in Wandsworth. The number of deaths shows an increase of 15, compared with 1902, and of 187, compared with the corrected decennial average. 31 of the deaths were of infants under one year, 72 of children from one to five years, and six from five to 15 years of age. The death-rate for the year was .43 per 1,000, compared with 39 in 1902, and 29 in 1901. The death-rate for the whole of London was .44 in 1903, and .50 in 1902. In January 1903 the London County Council made an order, which was approved by the Local Government Board, to the effect that Sections 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 68, 69, 70, 72, 73, and 74 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with respect to dangerous infectious diseases shall apply to the Administrative County of London, from and including 1st April, 1903, to the disease known as Measles. These sections refer chiefly to disinfection, exposure of infected persons and articles, knowingly letting houses in which infected persons have been lodging, and burial of persons who have died of infectious disease. They do not include the section requiring notification, and consequently it is impossible to get information as to all cases of this disease occurring in the Borough. Several medical men, especially in the month of April, notified cases assuming that it was notifiable, and since the 1st April 59 such notifications were received. A considerable number of notifications were received from parents, but the great majority of cases were notified by the teachers of schools. 61 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. When information was received of a case, of Measles, the premises were visited by the Sanitary Inspector and a post-card left to be filled up either by the medical attendant or by the parent, to be forwarded to me when the case or cases recovered. The premises were then disinfected by the sanitary staff, but I did not consider it necessary to have the bedding removed for steam disinfection. The majority of the rooms, bedding, etc., were disinfected with formalin, but in cases where the premises were dirty or infected with vermin sulphur was used. In all, since the order came in force 682 rooms were fumigated, this necessarily causing a large increase in the work of the disinfecting staff. In all the cases visited the usual form containing a summary of the clauses of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in force with reference to infectious diseases, was left by the Inspectors, so that eventually the public will come to know that Measles is a dangerous infectious disease. The following Table shows the number of cases of Measles and other non-notifiable diseases notified by the teachers in the elementary schools in the Borough. In all 3,083 cases were notified, 1,884 of Measles, 342 of Chicken-pox, 428 of Whooping Cough, 234 of Mumps, and 159 of Ringworm. With regard to the cases of Measles, of the total of 1,884, 635 were notified from schools in Wandsworth, 609 in Streatham, 309 in Clapham, 173 in Tooting, and 158 in Putney. These numbers only refer to cases of Measles in children belonging to the Borough. In some of the schools on the lists sent to me children residing in Battersea and Lambeth Boroughs are in attendance, and these were forwarded to the Medical Officer of Health for the respective Boroughs. 62 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

St. Leonard's Infants' School, Welllield Road, Streatham, closed from the 2nd to the 19th October. St. Leonard's Infants' School, Mitcham Lane, Streatham, closed for 14 days, from the 6th November. Mitcham Lane Board School, Infants' Department, closed for 14 days from the 12th November. St. Andrew's Roman Catholic School, Polworth Road, Streatham, closed from the 16th November to 2nd December. Undine Street Roman Catholic School, Tooting, closed from the 19th November to the 7th December. 64 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The effect of such closing was to check the outbreaks, and this was specially the case in Streatham where the large majority of the children was susceptible to the disease, no general outbreak having occurred in that part of Streatham chiefly affected for some years. The class-rooms of the following schools were disinfected by the sanitary staff : — Garratt Lane School, on the 18th March, 8 rooms. St. Leonard's Infants' School, Wellfield Road, Streatham, on the 5 th October, 3 rooms. St. Leonard's Infants' School, Mitcham Lane, Streatham, on the 13th November, 3 rooms. Sunnyhill Road Board School, Infants' Department, Streatham, on the 2nd December, 5 rooms. Eardley Road Board School, Infants' Department, Streatham, on the 17th December, 13 rooms Whooping Cough. 87 deaths occurred from this disease, an increase of 23 compared with 1902, and of five, compared with the corrected decennial average. 16 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 10 in Putney, 24 in Streatham, 12 in Tooting, and 25 in Wandsworth. With the exception of Clapham all the sub-districts show an increase compared with last year. 43 of the deaths were of infants under one year, and 41 of children from one to five years, only three deaths occurring above the latter age. The death-rate was .34 per 1,000, compared with .26 in 1902, and with .35 for the whole of London. Epidemic Influenza. The number of deaths from Influenza was only 39, compared with 93 in 1902, 41 in 1901, and 87 in 1900. The number of deaths was 52.5 below the corrected decennial average, and is the lowest number recorded since 1896. 13 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, two in Putney, 14 in Streatham, none in Tooting, and 10 in Wandsworth. 65 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The death-rate was .15 per 1,000, compared with .38 in 1902, and .18 in 1901. Diarrhœa. The number of deaths from Diarrhœa and Epidemic or Zymotic Enteritis was 96, three above last year, but 73.2 under the corrected decennial average. 20 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 11 in Putney, 14 in Streatham, 14 in Tooting, and 37 in Wandsworth. The death-rate was .38 per 1,000, the same as in 1902. The death-rate for the whole of London was .64, compared with .54 in 1902. Of the total deaths registered, 82, or 85 4 per cent. were of infants under one year. Including Enteritis the total number of deaths was 162, compared with 155 in 1902, 214 in 1901, and 246 in 1900. The low death-rate from these diseases was chiefly due to climatic conditions, the low temperature checking the growth of bacteria in milk, and the excessive rainfall acting as a cleansing agent to streets, yards, and sewers. The following Table shows the death-rate from Zymotic Diseases for the Borough for the year, as well as the two previous vears. TABLE XXIX. Death-rate per 1,000:- 1903 1901 1902 Small-pox .012 .108 — Diarrhœa .69 .38 .38 Diphtheria .17 .29 .18 Whooping Cough .25 .26 .34 Scarlet Fever .06 .09 .07 Influenza .17 38 .15 Enteric Fever .06 12 .07 Measles .29 39 .43 Special inquiries were made in 64 of the deaths out of the total of 96, 66 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The result of such inquiries shows that out of the 64 deaths, the children were wholly nursed by the mother in five cases only, the others being hand fed, either partially or wholly. The inquiries also showed that great carelessness was exhibited in the storage and preparation of the milk used, and also that in many cases the administration of improper food was largely responsible for the illness. These cases were visited by the lady Sanitary Inspector, and instructions were given and gladly received by the parents as to the proper feeding of infants. In 11 of the cases the mothers were employed either as charwomen or laundrywomen. Chicken-Pox. Up to the 7th January, 60 cases of this disease were notified 10 in Clapham seven in Putney, eight in Streatham, 10 in Tooting, and 25 in Wandsworth. 342 cases were notified from schools, compared with 259 in 1902. NON-ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The next Table shows the number of deaths from these for the year, as well as for the previous decennium for the whole Borough. The numbers for the years 1900, 1901, and 1902 are corrected for external and internal institutions. TABLE XXX.

Cancer. The total number of deaths from Cancer, including all diseases of a malignant nature was 247, compared with 222 in 1902, and 202 in 1901. The corrected death-rate was .98, compared with .90 in 1902 and .86 in 1901. The number of deaths and the death-rate in each subdistrict was as follows:—Clapham 51 and .95, Putney 24 and .93, Streatham 88 and 1.09, Tooting 12 and .55, and Wandsworth 72 and 1.03. Of the total deaths 91 were males and 156 females, an increase of five males and 20 females compared with 1902. The total number of deaths was 577 above the corrected average and is the highest recorded. Two of the deaths occurred at ages five to 15, two from 15 to 25, 123 from 25 to 65, and 120 over 65 years of age. The following Table shows the number of deaths according to parts of the body affected. TABLE XXXI. Locality of Disease. Males. Females. Total.

The greatest number of deaths occurred from Cancer of the Bowel, but 56 out of the total number of deaths of females occurred from Cancer of the Breast or Uterus. in my report for 1902 a chart was inserted showing the deathrate per 100,000 from 1885, and this year shows a still further increase in the rate, such rate having increased from 90 to 98. The next Table shows the rate per 100,000 for each of the separate sub-districts and for the whole Borough. Clapham and Putney have a lower rate than last year, but Streatham, Tooting, and Wandsworth a higher. in Streatham the rate has increased from 84 to 109 and in Wandsworth from 89 to 103 per 100,000. The low rate in Tooting is very remarkable and compares favourably with Putney which has almost the same population. One reason of the difference is doubtless the number of persons living at the Cancer age is much larger in Putney than in Tooting.

The number of deaths from Tubercular disease of the Lungs and other Tubercular diseases and the rate per 1,ooo for the whole Borough and for the separate sub-districts are shown in the next Table.

The corrected death-rate for Tubercular disease of the Lungs was .91, compared with .87 in 1902, and no in 1901; from other Tubercular diseases .45, compared with .40, and from all Tubercular diseases 1.36, compared with 1.27. From all Tubercular diseases the rates for the sub-districts of Clapham and Putney show a decrease compared with 1902, while in Streatham, Tooting, and Wandsworth there is an increase, most marked in the case of Wandsworth, where the rate has increased from 1.51 to 1.78 per 1,ooo, more than accounting for the increase in the Borough as a whole. With regard to Tubercular disease of the Lungs, Clapham, Putney, and Tooting are lower than last year, while Streatham and Wandsworth are higher, the former only very slightly while the latter has increased from .92 to 1.33. The rate for Other Tubercular diseases is slightly higher than last year for the whole Borough, and is higher in Clapham, Putney, Streatham, and Tooting, but lower in Wandsworth. 70 Re-port of the Med1cal Off1cer of Health. The lowest death-rate was 1n Streatham, v1z.:— 1.78, wh1le for Tubercular d1sease of the Lungs Streatham had also the lowest rate, v1z.:—.6l, and Wandsworth the h1ghest, v1z.:—1.33.

No death from Tubercular d1sease of the Lungs occurred under one year of age, only three from one to f1ve, f1ve from f1ve to 15, 42 from 15 to 25, 169 from 25 to 65, and 11 over 65 years of age. 143 of the deaths were of males and 87 of females, compared w1th 115 and 100 1n 1902. The 1ncrease 1s thus wholly due to the number of deaths of males. There was not the same d1fference between the number of deaths of males and females from Other Tubercular d1seases, the numbers be1ng respect1vely 65 and 48.

In January, 1903, the following report was presented to the Council, and it was decided that such notification should be adopted. At the Meeting of the Conference on Tuberculosis in July, 1901, the following resolution, among others, was passed : — "That the Voluntary Notification of cases of Phthisis "attended with tubercular expectoration, and the "increased preventive action which it has rendered "practical, have been attended by a promising measure "of success, and that the extension of notification "should be encouraged in all districts in which effi"cient Sanitary Administration renders it practicable "to adopt the consequential measures.. 73 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. in the Metropolis the following Boroughs have adopted this form of notification : — Finsbury. Hampstead. Southwark. Greenwich Kensington. Stoke Newington. Hammersmith. Lambeth. Woolwich. islington and some other Metropolitan Boroughs are considering the matter, while in the provinces no fewer than 36 Urban Authorities have adopted it. Among the more important of these Districts may be mentioned: — Manchester. Cardiff. Nottingham. Liverpool. Edinburgh. Sheffield. Brighton. Leeds. Southampton. That consumption is one of the most fatal of all diseases-is graphically seen in the Chart Out of a total of 27,761 deaths in the Borough during the 10 years 1892-1901, consumption of the lungs was the cause of 2,183, and if all other diseases of a tubercular nature are included, 3,037 deaths ; while from the five principal Zymotic diseases the total number of deaths was 2,477. During the 10 years 1892-1901 the average death-rate from all causes was 14.2, while from consumption the rate was 1.13, and if all other tubercular diseases be included 1.5 per 1,000. From the five Zymotics—measles, diphtheria, scarlet fever, enteric fever, and whooping cough—the death-rate was 1.27 per 1,000. Again, if we take the three chief notifiable diseases—scarlet fever, enteric fever, and diphtheria—the total number of deaths was only 944, compared with 2,183 from consumption. The chart shows that the mortality from Phthisis for the 10 years 1892-1901 to every 100 deaths from all causes was 7.8, while from the five principal Zymotics the mortality only shows an increase of 1 per 100. From all Tubercular diseases, including consumption, the mortality was 10.9, so that from these a little more than one-tenth of all the deaths are due; a sufficiently serious condition to warrant this Council in taking some action which may, and undoubtedly will, be productive of some benefit to the community. 74 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The deaths from consumption occur at different age periods to those from Zymotic diseases, and, from a financial aspect, at more valuable periods. Take, for example, the deaths occurring in the year 1901. Of 259 deaths at all ages from consumption, 44 occurred from 15 to 25, and 188 from 25 to 65, leaving only 27 at all other ages. From the five most fatal Zymotic diseases 200 deaths occurred, 46 under one year, 107 from 1 to 5 years, 36 from 5 to 15 years, leaving only 11 occurring at all the other ages. In view of the above statistics, i am of opinion that something further ought to be done to prevent this disease, more especially as the public are beginning to realise that it can be prevented. This Council has in the past done something by the distributton of circulars and by disinfecting the rooms, clothing, etc., where a death from consumption occurred, but if a voluntary system of notification be agreed upon a great deal more could be done, more especially in the more closely-populated localities, and among the poorer ratepayers of the Borough. The objects to be obtained by notification are : — (1) It will enable the Medical Officer to keep a register of houses in which consumption cases occur, so that the necessary disinfection may be carried out on change of tenant. 2) It will afford opportunities for inspecting the Sanitary condition of the premises, of remedying overcrowding, and of advising as far as is practicable the isolation of the patient. (3.) It will afford opportunities of giving advice by means of printed matter to those in charge of such patients regarding the infectivity of the disease, and the means to be used to prevent its spread. (4) it will enable your Medical Officer to make inquiries as to sources of infection. (5) It will enable the Sanitary Staff to periodically see to the disinfection of the room and clothing of the patient. Mortality for 10 years, 1892 to 1901,to every 100 deaths from all causes. 75 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (6) It will enable the Medical Officer of Health to notify if the patient removes to another Borough in London or to the Provinces. it would also be, i think, advisable for the Council to offer to have the sputa from cases of Phthisis examined free of charge, similar to what is done in cases of Typhoid Fever and Diphtheria. To carry out this work the co-operation of the medical men practising in the Borough is absolutely necessary, but i have not the slightest doubt but that such help will be freely given, as it has always been in the past. The fee proposed to be paid to medical practitioners for such notification of cases of consumption should be similar to what is paid at present in cases of scarlet fever, diphtheria, etc., viz.: — 2/6 for each case notified in private practice, and one shilling for each case notified in public practice. in Manchester, with a population of 546,000, the total number of deaths from Phthisis during the year 1901 was 1,142, equal to a rate of 2.09 per 1,000. in Liverpool, with a population of 686,000, 1,302 deaths occurred, or a death-rate of 1.9 per 1,000. Wh1le 1n Wandsworth, with a population of 243,000, the number of deaths was 259, or a rate of 1.10. 1n Manchester 1,339 cases, and in Liverpool 1,797 cases, were notified, so that if in this Borough the same proportion of cases to deaths were notified by medical men the number ought to be about 300. The actual cost of notification alone would therefore not be great. in connection with this system of notification the subject of providing suitable Sanatoria for the treatment of this disease is presently being considered by several Authorities. That such Sanatoria will prove a boon to those suffering from consumption there is no doubt; but, in my opinion, the permanent good to be obtained will, to a great extent, be minimised if means are not taken to secure that the patient ever after, or at least for many years, is not permitted to resume town life and work. The true solution would be for such patients to be permanently employed in the open air, and the provision of farm colonics, either at home or in the Colonies, would be a necessary adjunct to the treatment in Sanatoria. 76 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Some Authorities have already dealt with this matter, as for example:—in Liverpool, where the Guardians have erected a Hospital; in Sheffield, where the Council have resolved that a sum of £6,000 per annum be provided out of the rates in support of a Sanatorium about to be built. Brighton, Leeds, Sunderland, Bristol, and Bradford, as well as several County Authorities, have taken, or are taking, action in the matter. The following letter was sent to every medical man practising in the Borough : — THE VOLUNTARY NOTiFiCATiON OF CONSUMPTiON. Dear Sir, i have to inform you that the Council of this Borough have resolved to adopt a voluntary system of notification in cases of Tubercular Phthisis (Consumption), and i shall be obliged if you will kindly notify to me any cases of that disease where you are the Medical Attendant, especially those in which you consider the Sanitary Authority can assist in cleansing or in using any other means to prevent the spread of the disease. Notification may be made on the same forms as are used for the compulsory notifiable diseases. A fee of 2/6 will be paid for any notification of a case in private practice, and i /in public practice. No fee will however be paid for any cases previously notified. The Sanitary Authority have also decided to have specimens of sputum examined free of charge, and for that purpose suitable boxes can be obtained on application at the above Office. Yours faithfully, P. CALDWELL SMiTH, Medical Officer of Health. As soon as a case has been notified the Sanitary inspector visits the premises and fills up a form which has been drawn up, at the same time leaving a card of instructions containing the following information for the patients and those in attendance on them. 77 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Consumption or Tuberculosis. Consumption is an infectious and preventible disease caused by the inhalation of dust containing the microbes from the dried spit or phlegm of consumptive persons, which phlegm contains myriads of those microbes. With a view of preventing the spread of Consumption or other Tubercular Diseases, the Medical Officer of Health for the Borough recommends the following precautions:— 1.—The expectoration should never be allowed to get dry. The patient should not spit on the floors of a house, but either into pieces of rag or paper, which should at once be burned, or into a small vessel containing water. This vessel should be emptied into the drain outside the house once a day, and then scalded and recharged with water. 2.—The same precautions should be observed in a workshop as at home. 3.—No one should spit on the ground outside any building or in a public conveyance. 4.—There is, however, little risk of contracting the disease from the breath of consumptives, who may be closely attended upon by healthy persons. 5.—The rooms occupied by a consumptive person should be kept well ventilated and well lighted, as SUNLIGHT and FRESH AIR are the greatest enemies of infection. 6.—WET cleansing of rooms, particularly of bedrooms occupied by sick persons, should be substituted for "dusting" and sweeping. The room occupied by the patient will be cleansed and disinfected by the Sanitary Authority on application. 7.—In case of death the house will be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority if this is desired. A new tenant should not enter a house previously occupied by a consumptive person until such house has been thoroughly disinfected and cleansed 8.—Amongst the agencies which act powerfully in causing consumption are damp dwellings and workshops, overcrowding, defective ventilation, and alcoholic excess. These should be avoided. 9.—Cows are very subject to Tuberculosis, and the disease may be contracted by young children (among whom consumption 78 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. of the bowels is prevalent), by drinking unboiled milk obtained from Tubercular cows. 10.—Boiling the milk, even for a minute, effectually destroy any Tuberculosis germs that may be in it. ALL MILK SHOULD THEREFORE BE BOILED BEFORE BEING DRUNK. 11.—A consumptive mother should not suckle her baby. P. CALDWELL SMITH, Medical Officer of Health. Public Health Department, Huguenot Place, East Hill, Wandsworth, S.W. February, 1903. During the year 88 cases were notified by medical practitioners, five in Clapham, two in Putney, 15 in Streatham, eight in Tooting, and 58 in Wandsworth. In 69 of the cases special inquiries were made and the cards l0eft at the premises. Of this number 37 died during the year, two in Clapham, eight in Streatham, four in Tooting, and 23 in Wandsworth. Four of the cases were removed to the Union infirmary, five removed to other places, and 23 are still living in the Borough and kept under observation so that the necessary disinfection may be carried out. All the premises where a death occurred among the notified cases were disinfected, and the rooms cleansed by the owners. No difficulty was experienced in getting the cleansing done, although in some instances disinfection was not carried out by the sanitary staff of the Council. The Sanitary inspectors were instructed to call at all premises in which a death had occurred, and out of the 230 deaths, the house was in 119 cases disinfected and cleansed by the sanitary staff. In a large number of cases the disinfection was carried out privately after instructions by the medical attendant, and only in a few cases was disinfection either refused or not carried out. 79 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. On the whole the adoption of voluntary notification has proved of very great value. The cases notified nearly all occurred among the working classes where the information given on the cards would prove of most value, and such information was in all cases most gladly received by the relatives and the patients. In December inquiry was made at the public-houses in the Borough whether the occupiers would exhibit a bill calling attention to the danger to health caused by indiscriminate spitting, and in nearly every instance they stated that they would be quite willing to put up such a notice. The Council on my report agreed to have a notice printed, and this has now been distributed to all the public-houses in the Borough. This notice was as follows: — METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF WANDSWORTH. SPITTING. The Council of the above Borough beg to call attention to the serious danger to health, caused by indiscriminate Spitting in Public -houses and Workshops, and also to the following Bye-law made by the London County Council, viz.: — "No Person shall spit on the floor, side, or wall of "any public carriage, or of any public hall, public "waiting room, or place of entertainment, whether "admission thereto be obtained on payment or not.. HENRY GEORGE HILLS, Town Clerk. Council House, Wandsworth, January, 1904. I have no doubt but that the notice will not only be of some benefit to the occupiers of these premises, but also have an educational effect on those frequenting them. Bacteriological Examination of Sputum. 36 examinations of sputum were made for medical practitioners by the Lister institute of Preventive Medicine, 1i in Clapham, 80 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. two in Putney, seven in Streatham, four in Tooting, and 12 in Wandsworth. in 20 of these it was reported that the bacillus had been found and in 16 that it was absent. A large number of medical men either examine the sputum themselves or have it examined privately. Circulatory Diseases. During the year 410 deaths were registered as occurring from diseases of the Organs of the Circulatory System, which include not only those occurring from valvular disease of the heart, but also all other diseases of that organ. 104 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 36 in Putney, 129 in Streatham, 27 in Tooting, and 114 in Wandsworth. From organic valvular disease of the heart 125 deaths occurred, compared with 178 in 1902, and 143 in 1901. Two of these were of infants under one year, 12 of persons from five to 15, 10 from 15 to 25, 60 from 25 to 65, and 41 over 65 years. 60 of the deaths were of males and 65 of females. RESPIRATORY DISEASES. The number of deaths from the above group of diseases was 379, compared with 550 1n 1902. 87 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 30 in Putney, 92 in Streatham, 21 in Tooting, and 149 in Wandsworth. Of the total deaths 106 occurred from Acute Bronchitis, 76 from Chronic Bronchitis, 83 from Lobar Pneumonia, 92 from Lobular or Broncho-Pneumonia, and 21 from other diseases of the Respiratory Organs. Each of these is much lower than last year with the exception of other respiratory diseases which is the same. The large decrease in the number of the deaths from diseases of the Respiratory Organs is due to the fact that influenza was not prevalent, and also that the climatic conditions generally throughout the year did not favour the causation of these diseases. The number of deaths is 186 below the average for the preceding ten years corrected for increase of population. 81 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Premature Birth and Developmental Diseases. From these causes of death 322 deaths occurred, 180 of males and 142 of females, compared with 308 in 1902, and 274 in 190. in of the deaths were due to Premature Birth and 211 to Developmental Diseases. 313 were of infants under one year of age and nine of children from one to five years. 71 of these deaths occurred in Clapham, 28 in Putney, 87 in Streatham, 43 in Tooting, and 93 in Wandsworth. Old Age. 191 deaths occurred from Old Age, 72 of males and 119 of females, compared with 190 in 1902 and 184 in 1901. 54 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 21 in Putney, 49 in Streatham, 13 in Tooting, and 54 in Wandsworth. With one exception all the deaths were of persons over 65 years of age. 790 or 25.70 per cent. of the total deaths occurred in persons over 65 years of age, compared with 791 or 23.76 per cent. in 1902. The percentage of deaths of persons over 65 years of age to total deaths in the several sub-districts was as follows:—in Clapham 28.73, Putney 27.42, Streatham 30.02, Tooting 15.74, and Wandsworth 21.81. One death of a female of 105 years of age occurred in the Union infirmary. Deaths from other causes. From Cirrhosis of the Liver there were registered 36 deaths, 18 of males and 18 of females, compared with 40 in 1902; and from Nephritis and Bright's disease there were 79 deaths, compared with 81 in 1902. in the deaths from All Other Causes, which numbered 625, compared with 609 in 1902, are included all the deaths from diseases of the Nervous System, exclusive of Meningitis and Softening of the Brain, as well as the deaths from diseases of the intestinal Organs and of the Urinary Organs. Of the total deaths from All Other Causes, 140 occurred in Clapham, 61 in Putney, 215 in Streatham, 34 in Tooting, and 175 in Wandsworth, 82 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Violence. 111 deaths from Violence were registered during the year, 83 of these having been caused by Accident or Negligence, 27 by Suicide, and one from Homicide. 23 of these occurred n Clapham, 10 in Putney, 33 in Streatham, nine in Tooting, and 37 in Wandsworth. in all these deaths inquests were held. Inquests. The next Table shows the number of inquests held during the year in the Borough. The total number was 208, compared with 225 in 1902. 34 of the inquests were persons who died in Clapham, 27 in Putney, 46 in Streatham, 22 in Tooting, and 79 in Wandsworth. In 114 or 54.8 per cent. of the inquests a verdict of death from natural causes was returned; in 55 or 26.4 per cent. from accidental causes; in 23 or 11 per cent. from suicidal, one from homicide; in 12 open verdicts were returned, and three were executed by order of the law in H.M. Prison, Wandsworth. 44 of the inquests were held on persons not belonging to the Borough who died in the Borough. Six of the inquests were on persons who died in the Tooting Bee Asylum, seven in the Middlesex County Asylum, 12 in H.M. Prison, two in the Workhouse, one in St. Ann's Home, and 14 on persons who died in other places, as the River Thames, and on the streets. 83 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XXXV1.

In Putney five deaths occurred in the Priory, Roehampton, two from heart disease, one from Old Age and two from other diseases. In Tooting 336 deaths occurred in Public institutions, 121 of which were of persons belonging to this Borough. Of the 117 deaths in Tooting Bee Asylum, 23 were from Old Age, 23 from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, 10 from Cancer, nine from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, two from other Tubercular diseases, eight from influenza, one from Softening of the Brain, three from Organic disease of the Heart, four from 85 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Bright's Disease, three from Accidents, 18 from Diseases of the Nervous System, and 14 from All Other Causes. Of the 117 deaths in the Fever Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, 43 were from D1phtheria, 35 from Scarlet Fever, 16 from Enteric Fever, one from Measles, and 22 from All Other Causes. Of the 100 deaths in the Tooting Home 30 were from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, 25 from Old Age, 19 from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, one each from influenza, Heart Disease, and Cancer, and 23 from All Other Causes. One death from Old Age occurred in Newlands House, and one from other causes in Fairfield House. in Wandsworth 128 deaths occurred in the Middlesex County Asylum, five in the Workhouse, nine in the Prison, and seven in the Royal Hospital for incurables. Of the 128 deaths in the Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum, 30 were from Old Age, 12 from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, four from Cancer, five from Bright's Disease, three from other Tubercular diseases, two from Softening of the Brain, two from Accident, one each from Erysipelas, Alcoholism, Organic disease of Heart, Bronchitis, and Suicide, 57 from diseases of the Nervous System, and eight from All Other Causes. Of the five deaths in the Workhouse, two were from Premature Birth, and one each from Old Age, Pneumonia, and All Other Causes. Of the nine deaths in the Prison, three were from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, three from Execution, and one each from Pneumonia, Bright's Disease, and All Other Causes. Of the seven deaths in the Royal Hospital for incurables, two were from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, and five from All Other Causes. Of the 126 deaths in Public institutions of persons belonging to the Borough, 69 occurred in the Tooting Home, 51 in the Fever Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, three in the Hostel of God, and one each in the Workhouse, Tooting Bee Asylum, and the Middlesex County Asylum, 86 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The number of deaths in Public institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging to the Borough, arranged as to sex, age, causes of death, and the institution in which the death occurred is shown on Table iV., and of persons belonging to the Borough on Table V. Diseases of the Nervous System. From the above, which are included in All Other Causes, there were i20 deaths during the year, 56 of these being of persons belonging to Clapham, 19 to Putney, 18 to Streatham, and 74 to Wandsworth, Mortuaries. No change has taken place in the Mortuary arrangements during the year. The Mortuary at Clapham was improved by cementing the walls, and by the construction of a door with large glass panels so that bodies could be viewed without entering the room itself. The other Mortuaries were cleansed regularly as necessity arose. in Clapham 43 bodies were removed to the Mortuary, in Streatham 47, in Tooting 18, and in Wandsworth 104, of which 32 were from Putney, a total of 212. Nothing further has been done with reference to the erection of the new Mortuary and Coroner's Court in Wandsworth, as the land is not available. Water Supply. The Borough is supplied by two Companies, the Southwark and Vauxhall Company which supplier Putney, the greater part of Wandsworth and part of Clapham, and the Lambeth Company which supplies Streatham, Tooting, part of Wandsworth and part of Clapham. The following Tables, which have been extracted from the monthly reports of the Water Examiners appointed under the Metropolis Water Act, 1871, show the results of analyses of the water of the two Companies for each month during the year. 87 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The following report was also made to the Public Health Committee in July: — in consequence of numerous complaints as to the colour of the water supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company i instructed the inspector to take a sample of the water from the Public Health Department for the purpose of being analysed. The sample was taken on the 22nd June, and was received by the Public Analyst on the 23rd June. The analysis shows that there has been very serious pollution of the water supplied, the organic matter showing an enormous increase. An independent examination was made by a resident in the Borough and his report showed similar results, but in addition a bacteriological examination showed that the water contained a large number of bacteria, and many colon bacilli. The Official Analysts' report for the month of June will not be received until next week, and 1 would call the attention of the Committee to the fact that no information was received from them by the Sanitary Authority of any pollution of the water supplied. i am of opinion that the Medical Officers of Health ought to be informed at once by the Official Analysts when any extensive pollution of the water is observed so that some means of preventing any evil effect may be at once taken by the Sanitary Authority, such as the distribution of notices broadcast throughout the Borough to the effect that the water is not in a satisfactory condition, and should be filtered and boiled before being drunk. The Medical Officers of Health of the Metropolitan Boroughs in London, have always depended upon the daily analyses of the Official Analysts as being sufficient to protect the interests of the public, but unless the information is communicated to the Sanitary Authority concerned, their analysis is, from the public point of view, not of much advantage. i have also received complaints with reference to the Lambeth Company's water, but this water has not been analysed by the Public Analyst of the Borough. 90 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. An examination of these Tables shows that with regard to the Lambeth Company's water on one occasion it was described as bad, on another very unsatisfactory, on another satisfactory, on six occasions indifferent, on one less impure, and only on two occasions was the water stated to be good. With regard to the Southwark and Vauxhall Company's water, on two occasions the quality was stated to be unsatisfactory, on three indifferent, on two fair, and on five occasions the water was of good quality. The Lambeth Company's water was worst in the months of May, June, October, and November; and the Southwark and Vauxhall Company's in the months of June, October, November, and December. The polluted condition of the water was due to the heavy rainfall, and the consequent inability of the filters to remove all the suspended matter. The attention of the Public Health Committee was called to the quality of the water supplied, and analyses were made by the Public Analyst to the Borough, and his analyses also showed that the quality of the water was very unsatisfactory. The pollution was, judging from the analyses made by the Public Analyst and also taking into account the analyses of the Water Examiner, due to pollution by vegetable organic matter, and was not necessarily injurious to health. Cases of illness due to the water did, however, occur, but this was chiefly owing to the want of cleansing of the cisterns from which the drinking water was taken. The suspended matter deposited at the bottom of the cisterns, if of considerable amount, was in some instances carried into the supply pipe, and this caused Diarrhoea and digestive troubles, which ceased as soon as the cisterns were properly cleansed. One case of local contamination of the water supply, the cause of which was only a matter of conjecture, occurred in the beginning of the year and suspicions were directed to the water, as no other cause of several cases of Enteric Fever could be ascertained. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 91 An analysis of the water on the 3rd January showed that the water was polluted and a sample was sent to the Lister Institute for bacteriological examination. The report from that Institute stated that the Bacillus Coli Communis was present to the extent of at least 20 per cubic centimeter. The cistern was thoroughly cleansed, as also all the service pipes in the house, and another sample was taken for analysis. This showed that the water was quite satisfactory in quality and similar to the water taken from the main in the immediate neighbourhood. Three other analyses of water were made during the year, one from a well at Clarence Farm, Priory Lane, Roehampton, which was found to be at the time of fairly good quality, another from the Public Drinking Fountain, Roehampton, also of satisfactory quality, and a third from a Pasteur-Chamberlain Filter at Messrs. Wickens, Pease & Company's works, Garratt Lane, Wandsworth, which was decidedly polluted and unfit for drinking ■ purposes. In the last case the supply was stopped and water from the Company's mains laid on. None of the water from the other wells in the Borough, particulars of which were given in last year's Report, were examined during the year. Housing of the Working Classes. The following report was made to the Council by the Public Health Committee in August: — REPORT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE. Since the presentation of the last report to the Council on October 1st, 1902, the Committee, through the Housing Sub-Committee, has continued its enquiries in various parts of the Borough, has visited several apparently suitable areas, has made inquiries into prices of land and has considered a number of schemes submitted to it by the Council in furtherance of the object. The following suggestions were made and on them the Housing Sub-Committee has reported: — 92 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (a) That the necessary steps be taken to secure an alteration in the law, to enable Borough Councils toacquire land for other than "Housing" purposes. This has been adopted by the suggestion to the Home Secretary that a clause should be inserted in the Bill dealing with the Housing of the Working Classes which it is understood the Government propose to introduce enabling Borough Councils to save cost of land by dealing advantageously with the frontages. (b) That inquiry be made as to what suitable land belonged to the Council. The only land is that of the Pest House Charity in Putney, on which workmen's cottages are already built. (c) To build on surplus land adjoining the Cemetery at Earlsfield. This would require an Act of Parliament to alienate the land taken for the purpose of a cemetery, even if it were advisable to do so. (d) That houses be built for our own workmen. This we have considered impracticable. (e) The site of the old fire station at Clapham. This is too small. (f) A site suggested in the Wandsworth Road. The price of this is prohibitive. (g) A site on the boundary of Wandsworth and Streatham. There is no need for such housing there. It is not near enough to centres of work. The Committee would point out, that although this matter has been frequently discussed in the Council and published in the Local Press, the Committee has not received any suggestion or assistance from anybody or representative institution of the Working Classes. A suggestion that any scheme should take the form of Municipal Lodging Houses has been carefully considered and thought to be worth following up, and an attempt has been made to find suitable sites in various parts of the Borough. Inquiries are to be made further in regard to a site recently proposed, but as a rule the Committee finds that, working Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 93 under the present Act, the price of land in the position in which dwellings or lodging houses would be mostly required and likely to be successful, that is, not likely to come upon the rates for support, is practically prohibitive and that where the price is reasonable there is. ample provision by private enterprise. It is clear, too, that there is no such overcrowding in the Borough as to necessitate a large outlay with the probability of a partially rate-supported work. During the many discussions and inquiries that have taken place on this question, it has suggested itself to the Committee, that probably no greater amount of good in improving the conditions of the Working Classes in this Borough could be done than by working in a new direction by forming "bathhouses" in populous, poor districts. That is to take a house in a populous and poor neighbourhood and fit slipper baths in most of the rooms, the use of which might be obtained at a very moderate cost, and the Committee therefore recommends an investigation on these lines. {Signed) JOHN GAY, Chairman. Council House, Wandsworth, 30th July, 1903. The question of providing slipper baths, as mentioned in the above report, was considered by the Committee, and it was decided to erect on a suitable site in Clapham baths of that character. The question of site is now being considered by another Committee of the Council. General Sanitary Work in 1903. The following list shows the special inspections made by me during the past year. In addition to these, however, a large number of special inspections of underground bakehouses were made before certifying to the Council that a certificate under the Factory and Workshop Act could be granted. (1).—Guelph Street and Lydden Grove, Wandsworth, with reference to the general sanitary condition of the houses. 94 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (2).—River Wandle and Graveney. These streams were the subject of special reports to the Council, and these reports were as follows : — REPORT ON THE CONDITION OF THE RIVER WANDLE. The River Wandle enters the Borough at Summerstown, close to the Corruganza Works and forms the boundary between the Borough and the Urban District of Wimbledon until it reaches a point opposite the foot of Groton Road. From that point to the River Thames it forms the division between the Southfield and the Springfield and Fairfield Wards. From the Corruganza Works to the dam erected above the outfall of the sewage from the Croydon Rural District the River is fairly clean, as will be seen from the sample taken above the dam, and the bed of the River does not, except at the dam itself, seem to have much deposit. The only source of pollution is from some of the bywashes and the overflow from the Wimbledon Sewage Farm. The effluent from the Croydon Rural District is, as will be seen from the sample, a fairly clean one, and much freer from sewage fungus than I have ever seen it. The effluent from the Wimbledon Sewage Farm, a sample of which was also taken at the same time, was also of a satisfactory character. The River is dammed at this portion to supply water to Messrs. Wickens, Pease & Co., and the mill-race on passing the main stream runs at the rear of the houses in Summerley Street under the railway. At this point the water is more polluted and the bed of the River full of mud and refuse owing to the fact that the body of water is smaller and has not the same cleaning power and also to the fact that the washings from Messrs. Wickens, Pease & Co.'s works run into it at this point. This portion ought to be periodically cleansed. On the other side of the railway bridge pollution is being caused by the discharge into the river of washings from the gas factory belonging to the London and South-Western Railway Company. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 95 On the 15th, 22nd, and 23rd of this month this discharge was serious and was noticeable as far down as the bridge at Lydden Grove, and to a slight extent at the Upper Mills, South Street. The attention of the London County Council and the Thames Conservancy should be called to the pollution. From the bridge at Penwith Road to the foot of Guelph Street the River is polluted by surface washings and by the depositing of all kinds of house and trade refuse, manure, etc., in it but there is no direct discharge into it of any sewage matter. At Messrs. McMurray's Mills a large quantity of water is abstracted and considerable subsidence of suspended matter takes place, but all this portion to the weir on the north side ot McMurray's Mills requires cleansing. The occupiers of houses on the bank should be warned by circular not to deposit any house refuse in the River. From McMurray's Mills to the Upper Mills, South Street, where there is another weir, there is extensive deposit in the bed of the River, and more especially at the back of the houses between the Upper Mills and Messrs. Freeman's Varnish Works. This portion also requires cleansing, as also does that portion from the Upper Mills to the Middle Mills, where, at the latter place another dam exists, the water in which is not at present utilised. From the Middle Mill to the Electric Lighting Station there is also considerable deposit in the bed of the River, and this should also be cleansed. I am of opinion that the condition of the River, although not at all times a menace to the health of the district, is so in the summer months and after continued drought, and I would therefore recommend this Committee to call the attention of the London County Council and the Thames Conservancy to its present condition, so that remedial and preventative measures could be taken before the present summer. REPORT OF THE CONDITION OF THE RIVER GRAVENEY. The River Graveney enters this Borough at Mitcham Road, Tooting, between Longley Road and Renmuir Street, runs towards Bickersteth Road, passes under Longley Road diagonally in a culvert, emerging at the back of No. 108, Longley Road, runs 96 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. at the back of the houses in Longley Road, and enters Croydon Rural District at the rear of No. 98, Longley Road. From Mitcham Road to Bickersteth Road there is a slight deposit of mud, and at the Bridge in Mitcham Road an accumulation of decaying driftwood There is also a deposit of refuse at the rear of No. 195, Longley Road. The culvert itself is free from deposit and from the end of the culvert to the boundary there is little or no deposit. The condition of the River is very much better than it was during the summer months, as the channel, especially from Bickersteth Road to the boundary has been well scoured in consequence of the River having been in flood. The portion from the bridge over Mitcham Road to the culvert should be cleansed out periodically. The River Wandle was in consequence cleansed out by the London County Council and the bed of the River was much improved. Several complaints were received with reference to the depositing of mud taken from the River on the adjoining land, but after several inspections of such deposits I was of opinion that no nuisance was caused. None of the deposit was offensive with the exception of a small amount removed from the River near Messrs. Wickens, Pease & Co.'s works, but in a few days the smell disappeared. Carbolic powder was used freely, and this tended to lessen any smell that was caused when the mud was first deposited. (3).—Foss and Hazelhurst Road, Balham. These were inspected for the purpose of placing a number of houses in these streets on the Register of Houses let in Lodgings. (4).—Special inspections were also made of the houses in Nelson's Row, White Square, Perseverance Grove, Park Place, Rowland's Cottages, Young's Rents, Clapham, and several of the houses were on one occasion also inspected by the Housing Committee of the Council. (5).—In consequence of a letter from the Under Secretary of State inspection was made of land in Merton Road, Wandsworth, purchased by the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Light and Coke Company for the purpose of erecting dwellings for the working classes, and the following report was made to the Council: — Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 97 "With reference to the site in Merton Road, Wandsworth, "shown on the plan submitted by the Wandsworth and Putney "Gas Light and Coke Company, I have to report that three trial "holes were dug on the piece of land which in my opinion had "been made up. Two of the trial holes at the most southern part "of the site were made up with proper and satisfactory material, "but the ground at the northern part of the site on which pig-sties "had been built, was made up to a large extent with house refuse. "The ground water for the whole of this part of the site was from "2 feet to 2 feet 6 inches from the surface of the ground. This "level would no doubt fluctuate according to the condition of the "River Wandle and the by-washes. "With the exception of the small portion of the land as above "mentioned, I am of opinion that, provided the sites of the houses "are properly concreted, and the subsoil thoroughly drained, no "objection could possibly be taken to the erection of dwelling"houses on the rest of the land shown on the plan." (6).—A special inspection of several sites in Clapham for the erection either of houses for the working classes or of municipal lodging-houses was made, but it was found either that the cost was prohibitive or that it would be impossible to purchase the land on any terms. (7).—Caistor Road Mews, Balham, was inspected on several occasions, and the question of paving this mews was remitted to the New Streets Committee who decided to recommend the Council to adopt it as a new street. This was done and the whole mews was paved throughout, thus getting rid of a nuisance which had for several years been a source of annoyance to the adjoining occupiers. (8).—Clarence Farm, Roehampton, was specially inspected by me as the Sanitary Inspector reported that several insanitary conditions existed owing to the want of proper drainage and the absence of water-closet accommodation. An order was made by the Council that the premises should be properly drained and water-closets provided, and this order was complied with by the owner. (9).—Radbourne Road, Balham, with reference to the concrete under floors of houses and also as to the nature of the subsoil. 98 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (10).—Lower Richmond Road, Putney, as to ventilation of sewers in that, and neighbouring roads. (11)—Floss Street, Putney, with reference to water at rear of houses. The accumulation of water there was due to the filling up of an old ditch on land in the rear of these houses, the ditch being the natural drain discharging into the Beverley Brook. (12).—Dutch Yard, High Street, Wandsworth, with reference to condition of yard and houses. (13).—The Brickfields, Lonesome, Streatham. Complaints had been received from inhabitants of South Streatham of offensive smells from these brickfields. Shortly after my inspection the brick burning ceased and although the owner erected and lighted another clamp, yet no complaint was made of nuisance by any of the inhabitants in the neighbourhood. It was not thought necessary to take more decided action in the matter as the brickfields are situated at the extreme boundary and about half a mile from the nearest inhabited houses in the Borough. (14).—Special inspections were also made of several localities in the Borough, notably Wardley Street and Bendon Valley, Wandsworth; Larch Road, Balham, and White Square, Clapham, as these localities were specially mentioned in Mr. Chas. Booth's book on Life and Labour in London (vols. 5 and 6), and the following report was made to the Council in July: — REPORT ON THE CONDITION OF HOUSES IN CERTAIN LOCALITIES IN THE BOROUGH MENTIONED IN MR. CHAS. BOOTH'S BOOK ON LIFE AND LABOUR IN LONDON. Ín consequence of statements made in Mr. Chas. Booth's books on Life and Labour in London, dealing with religious influences, that certain areas in this Borough were insanitary, the following report has been prepared. Although dealing chiefly with the statements made by Mr. Booth, detailed inquiries have been made in each locality not only of the occupants of the houses in these areas, but also of the rents paid and the wages earned, and any statements made in this report have been sufficiently Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 99 fied to enable me to say that they are in these respects practically correct. The three areas specifically mentioned are Larch Road, Balham; White Square and Nelson's Row, Clapham; and Wardley Street, Wandsworth. Before entering into a detailed description of each locality I may here state that none of these areas are insanitary. There are insanitary houses in each locality it is true, but this is due to the personal habits of the people, and the number of insanitary houses in each of these areas differ very considerably for the same reason. From personal inspection of houses in each locality at various times I can unhesitatingly say that there are houses in each of these localities which for cleanliness, air space, and general sanitary condition will compare favourably with any houses of a similar character in London. With regard to Larch Road, a street close to Balham Station, there is no doubt that the sanitary condition has not been in the past all that could be desired. Recently, however, owing to frequent inspection the houses have been very much improved, and there has been to some extent a corresponding improvement in the class of tenants. At the recent inspection by the Sanitary Inspector there were 75 inhabited houses in this street. 19 were occupied by one family, 26 by two families, 28 by three families, and two by four families. The number of families living in one room was four, the number living in two rooms four, the number in three rooms 110, and the number in four rooms and upwards 42. The only point that calls for attention in the above statement is the fact that 28 houses were occupied by three families. These premises were, I understand, built for the express purpose of accommodating three families, and separate sanitary conveniences exist for each family. Ten of the houses have been placed on the Register of Houses Let in Lodgings, and 35 are presently under notice to be registered, but the owners objected. The case is now under the consideration of the Magistrate for decision. In only one case was there any overcrowding, and this was purely domestic, the occupiers having occupied the house for some 100 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. years and the number of children having outgrown the accommodation. The rents in Larch Road vary from 5/6 to 20/- per house, or equal to 1/6 to 2/10 per room. The greater proportion of the houses are, however, rented from 5/6 to 7/6 for three rooms, this of course including all rates and taxes. The houses in this street are occupied chiefly by general labourers, hawkers, and costers, and a few mechanics. With regard to Nelson's Row and White Square, Clapham, Mr. Booth remarks that it was "once a notorious den of iniquity "and rowdyism, and still bad as well as poor." "The Square is "an open space unpaved and uncared for, surrounded by twostoreyed houses in which live a large number of costers." The Sanitary Inspector for that district has known it for some years and reports that the social condition of the people has much improved during the last 20 years, and that the houses are now in a much more satisfactory sanitary condition. My own personal inquiries have led me to a similar conclusion. There is little or no poverty. The houses are in most cases clean, and no overcrowding existed in the whole of the 118 houses specially inspected. With regard to school attendance, I have been informed by the head mistress of the school in the Square that the children are very regular, and that she has not at any time trouble with either children or parents. Occasionally she finds that the children are not so clean and tidy as they should be, but they always seem to have plenty to eat, although some of the food maybe of an improper character. A house-to-house inspection has recently been made by the Sanitary Inspector and such inspection shows that out of a total of 115 houses 90 were occupied by one family, 20 by two families, and two by three families; while of the number of families, 12 lived in one room, 24 in two rooms, 28 in three rooms, and 76 in four rooms and upwards. A considerable proportion of these houses have been redrained during the past ten years. In the present inspection the only sanitary defects found were dirty ceilings, defective watercloset cisterns, and a few defective cistern covers. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 101 The occupations of the residenters in White Square and Nelson's Row are as follows:—Labourers 51, laundresses 13, gardener I, stone masons 2, coal porters 3, Borough Council employees II, costers 25, bricklayers 3, engine drivers 2, leather worker 1, carmen 7, gas fitter 1, painters 3, charwomen 12, bottlers 2, booksellers assistant 1, cab owner 1, apprentice 1, employed on London County Council trams 5, needlework and dressmaking 8, horsekeepers 4, blacksmith 1, shopkeepers 3, beerhouse keepers 2, shop assistants 8, chair mender 1, paper seller 1, traveller 1, miner 1, waiter 1, plasterer 1, cab driver 1, packer 1, domestic servants 2, widows (old, without employment) 7. The statement in Mr. Booth's book that a large number of costers reside here is not exactly true, as the above detailed report shows that only 25 out of a total number of 154 employed belong to that class. The Square itself is scavenged by the Wandsworth Borough Council, and although I have frequently visited it I have never found it to be in an unsatisfactory condition. The statements by Mr. Booth with reference to the Valley of the Wandle are so serious that it is necessary to deal with this locality in a more detailed manner. It is perfectly true that a large amount of building is going on in this neighbourhood, but I emphatically protest against the definite statement made by Mr. Booth that such building is "of a vile character and inevitably "involves the creation of new slum areas." His definition of a slum area and my own may not exactly correspond, but I cannot believe that the nature of the buildings at present being erected can possibly tend to the creation of slums in the proper sense of the word. The localities specifically mentioned comprise the new streets north of Wardley Street, such as Lydden Grove, Guelph Street, Twilley Street, and Furmage Street, and from an inspection of such property I have no hesitation in stating that these will compare favourably with any other of the same class in London. The statement made by Mr. Booth is to the effect "that the "streets building north of Wardley Street are the worst of many "badly built streets in the Wandle Valley." Another statement of a serious nature makes an almost definite charge of corruption against the officials who had the superintendence of the erection 103 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. of these houses. Mr. Booth states that "what is happening can "only be explained as the result of official corruption." The sanitary arrangements of all the new houses in these new streets are most satisfactory, each flat being supplied with a water-closet of approved pattern constructed under the supervision of the Sanitary Inspector, and the drains were also laid under his supervision. Another statement made with reference to the houses being erected in this locality is to the effect that " ground on the opposite "bank is being filled up with filthy decaying refuse, and on the "ground so raised streets are planned." This is an absolute falsehood. The ground being filled up with decaying refuse referred to is the slop shoot which is the property of this Council, and which will not, and cannot be built on at any time. If the quotation does not refer to this the only other locality that it can refer to is the ground recently built on comprising Penwith and Strathville Roads, and although this ground has to some extent been made up, the material used has been of a satisfactory character. The streets specifically mentioned by Mr. Booth as being an insanitary area are Wardley Street, Bendon Valley, and Lydden Road, the worst of these being, in his opinion, Wardley Street. I have had a very complete house-to-house inspection made of these three localities within the last few weeks, and with regard to the two last, viz.—Bendon Valley and Lydden Road, I am able to report that the houses are in a very satisfactory condition, and with the exception of a few notices served for dirty walls and ceilings no insanitary conditions were found. In Bendon Valley 45 houses were inspected, 23 of these were occupied by one family, 13 of two families, two of three families, and two by four families. The rents vary from 5/- to 12/6 per house, or from 1/3 to 1/7 per room. With regard to Wardley Street it may be stated that this street occupies rather a peculiar position. The street itself consists of 78 houses, 74 of which were inspected, two being unoccupied, and in two cases entrance could not be obtained owing to the absence of the occupiers from home during the day. The street, although not a cul-de-sac, is nearly so, as the street leading into Lydden Road is blocked by 3 houses with the exception of a Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 103 small passage way about 8 feet broad. The removal of these houses would, in my opinion, be beneficial. 25 families occupy one room, 39 occupy two rooms, 31 occupy three rooms, and 25 four rooms and upwards. The number of houses occupied by one family is 28, by two families 41, and by three families four. There are also two common lodging-houses in the street which are under the supervision of the London County Council, and nine of the houses are registered as houses let in lodgings. There are also, included in the houses inspected, 11 general shops. 35 of the houses have four rooms in the house (not including kitchen and scullery), but originally these consisted of four rooms, but one room in each case has been made into a shop. The occupations of the males are as follows:—Hawkers and costers 64, general labourers 32, carmen 9, bricklayers 3, plasterers 2, employees of the Wandsworth Borough Council 3, and the rest consist of tinkers, wood choppers, and rag and bone dealers. It would be interesting to ascertain why this street should be occupied by so many of the coster class. The only reasonable explanation is that when the Wandsworth Common Act was passed in 1874, the costers and hawkers who at that time lived in vans on the Common were cleared away, and as they had to find some place of residence in the neighbourhood they migrated to Wardley Street, the houses in which, at that time, had been recently erected. Since 1874 this class has always resided in Wardley Street and the present occupiers are largely the second generation, although there still remain some of the original occupiers. The Sanitary Inspector who has inspected this street on three separate occasions reports that at his last inspection the houses were in a much better condition. The only insanitary conditions that may be said to exist are conditions arising from the careless habits of the people themselves. Nearly all the notices that have been served under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, under the recent inspection were notices to cleanse the walls and ceilings of rooms and passages, and in a few instances to remedy defective water-closet cisterns, the defects in these cisterns being largely in consequence of bad usage 104 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. There is very little poverty among this class, although labelled by Mr. Booth as "gipsy poor." The rents are as a rule paid regularly. One statement made by Mr. Booth with reference to this street is one which can easily be refuted, the statement being that there is "throughout the street a family to every room." The recent inspection shows that out of 120 families residing there only 25 occupy one room. A further inquiry into such occupation shows that in nearly all the cases the family consisted of a man and his wife, and in only one or two cases were there any children. All the rooms occupied by one family were measured by the Sanitary Inspector and the cubic capacity for each family was found to be ample. The rents in Wardley Street vary from six to nine shillings per house or from 1/5 to 2/3 per room. I have always realised that this street and one or two others in the Borough of a similar character require frequent inspection but if the occupants themselves would realise their responsibilities with regard to cleanliness of the house and person there would be very little to complain of. The people themselves seem to have an instinctive dislike to soap and water, and the only remedy that the Sanitary Authority has is to inspect such localities frequently and to serve notices for cleansing of the premises either on the occupier or owner. The personal cleanliness is a matter in which the Sanitary Authority can do little, but the visit of the Sanitary Inspector frequently has a beneficial result. There also exists in this street a yard in which there are a number of vans, some on wheels and some permanent, occupied by a class of costers peripatetic in their habits. Most of these have resided there for a considerable time, and in most cases the By-laws with respect to Tents and Vans are evaded. I feel certain that if this area was cleared there would be a decided improvement in the street itself, but I fear there is no power in the present case to condemn it as an insanitary area. Notices have recently been served to have the yard paved with impervious material and also for contravention of the By-laws as to overcrowding and other insanitary conditions which at present exist in the vans themselves. As these notices have not been, up to the Re-port of the Medical Officer of Health. 105 present, complied with, the matter has been placed in the hands of the Council's Solicitor. Some remarks are also made in Mr. Booth's book with reference to the condition of affairs in Tooting. The statement in the book is to the effect that "building is now proceeding with, in "many cases, houses of the worst character that could be passed "by the most lenient inspector," also that "the streets in "Totterdown are of the worst type," and that "throughout the "whole of Tooting there exists damp air, unhealthy soil, houses " ill-built and uncared for." The same remarks made in this report with reference to the new buildings in Garratt Lane also apply to those here mentioned by Mr. Booth. I presume that the streets in Totterdown are Letchworth, Kellino, and St. Cyprian Streets, as the houses erected by the London County Council were not at the time of his report in existence. It would have been interesting to hear what Mr. Booth would have said with respect to the small houses erected by the London County Council, as in my opinion a large proportion of the houses erected by the so-called speculative builder affords more ample accommodation for the money than the houses erected by the London County Council. With reference to the statement that there exists damp air and unhealthy soil, I would only call attention to the mortality statistics for this district in my Annual Reports. The death-rate for 1901 for the whole of this parish was 15.33, and for 1902 13.85, which rates compare very favourably with those of other districts of a similar character. One point which the Public Health Committee might reasonably consider is the provision of proper small bathing and washing establishments in the localities which have just been dealt with. At a small cost houses could be secured in which baths for washing might be constructed so that the inhabitants of these localities would at least have the opportunity afforded them at a small cost of cleansing themselves. Large swimming baths are a luxury and ought to be paid for by the public who utilise them, small baths and 106 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. washhouses are a sanitary necessity and might be erected by the Sanitary Authority at little cost and with the probability of being self-supporting.

(17).—Houses in Gardener's Lane, Putney, as to the number of persons displaced in consequence of street widening. In addition to the above special inspections, 433 special inspections were made, chiefly previous to the service of statutory notices, these including inspection of factories and workshops. My attendance at the Police Court was necessary on ten separate occasions. The Table of Sanitary Operations gives a complete record of the work carried out by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year. The number of complaints received and attended to was 1,481, compared with 14,445 in 1902. The number of houses and premises inspected was 16,419, compared with 14,703 in 1902, and 12,592 in 1901. The increase was general a11 all the sub-districts with the exception of Putney, and this was to some extent due to the amount of time taken up in the inspection of underground bakehouses. 5,219 house-to-house inspections were made, compared with 4,823 in 1902. In Clapham, Tooting, and Wandsworth, the number of these inspections have increased, while in Putney and Streatham there is a decrease compared with last year.

The Tables of house-to-house inspections which follow show the names of the streets and the number of houses inspected, the number of houses in which defects were found, the percentage of defects to houses inspected, as well as the number of families living in one, two, three, and four rooms and upwards. The total number of houses in which any sanitary defect was found was 2,744 or 52.57 of the total inspected. The highest percentage was in Balham, where 79.79 Per cent, had sanitary defects, and the next in Streatham with 76.49 per cent., Southfield, in Wandsworth, had the lowest percentage, viz.:—27 44, the next lowest being Putney with 35.59 per cent. The number of families living in one room and the total families were as follows, Clapham North 134 out of 1,232, or 10.8 per cent; Clapham South 12 out of 771, or 1.5 per cent.; Putney 4 out of 721, or '55 per cent.; Streatham 9 out of 262, or 3.4 per cent.; Balham 57 out of 1,334 or 4.2 per cent: ; Tooting 6 out of 372, or l.6 per cent.; Southfield 21 out of 835, or 2 5 per cent.; Fairfield 53 out of 611, or 8.6 per cent.; and Springfield 61 out of 577, or 10.5 per cent.; while in the Borough as a whole 357 families out of a total of 6,732 lived in one room, or a percentage of 5.3. The reason of the high percentage in Clapham North was due to the fact that during the year nearly all the streets likely to be occupied by persons living in one or two rooms were inspected, such as Rashleigh Street, Clifton Street, Nelson's Row, and Crescent Road. In Springfield Ward, Wandsworth the high percentage was due to the inspection of Wardley Street and Bendon Valley. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 109 House to-House Inspections.

The total number of intimation notices served during the year was 5,797, compared with 6,471 in 1902, and of statutory notices 785, compared with 899 in 1902. The number of cases of overcrowding dealt with during the year was 92, compared with 109 in 1902. Of these 64 cases occurred in the sub-district of Wandsworth, chiefly in the Fairfield and Springfield Wards. With the exception of nine all these cases were due to domestic overcrowding, while of the nine, eight were due to lodgers, and one case occurred in a house registered as a house let in lodgings. All the cases of overcrowding were remedied without having resource to legal proceedings. 803 ashpits were provided or repaired, compared with 610 in 1902, and 438 complaints of non-removal of house refuse (92 from Clapham, 33 from Putney, 131 from Streatham, 53 from Tooting, and 129 from Wandsworth), were received during the year. All these complaints were inquired into by the special Inspectors appointed for that purpose, and in the majority of cases the non-removal was due to the fact that the occupants were out at the time the dustmen made the regular collection. With reference to the collection of house refuse in the Eastern District, Mr. Marten, the Surveyor, reports as follows:— In the Eastern District, comprising Clapham, Balham, Streatham, and Tooting, the collection of house refuse is carried out by the Council with their own horses and vans and men in their employ. The refuse from Clapham (Northern Portion) is taken away by rail to Sevenoaks, Kent, and from Streatham (Southern Portion) by rail from Streatham Common Station; from the remaining part of the District, viz.:— Clapham (Southern Portion), Balham, Streatham, and Tooting, is burnt at the Dust Destrutor, Tooting. There is a weekly collection, but certain premises including flats are at the discretion of the Surveyor cleared two or three times a week. In the Western District, Mr. Dodd, the Surveyor, reports that no change has taken place in the method of removal during the year, particulars of which were given in the Report for the year 1901. 118 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 822 yards in connection with dwelling houses and 69 in connection with stables were drained, paved, or cleansed during the year, compared with 761 and 40 in the previous year. The climatic conditions during the year were such that a large number of yards in connection with dwelling houses were rendered insanitary. In the majority of cases the yard had been paved, but was in a dilapidated condition. This class of nuisance is almost wholly confined to the houses occupied by the working classes, and no trouble was experienced in having the nuisance abated. 3,187 rooms and 449 passages were cleansed and repaired, compared with 3,086 and 404 in 1902. 1,245 drains were cleansed and repaired, an increase of 309, compared with the previous year. 249 notices of reconstruction of drains were sent on to the Surveyors from this Department; 26 in Clapham, 29 in Putney, 105 in Streatham, seven in Tooting, and 82 in Wandsworth. The number of water-closets cleansed and repaired was 1,783, compared with 1,465 in 1902. 282 accumulations of manure were removed after service of notice. A considerable number of complaints have been received with reference to nuisances from this cause. 29 orders had to be served under the By-laws for the periodical removal of the manure every forty-eight hours. 849 water cisterns were cleansed, covered or repaired, an increase of 124, compared with last year. As the By-law which refers to the cleansing of cisterns was found not to be complied with in a large number of premises, I advised the Council to have a circular letter printed which could be either left at each house or forwarded to owners of property. The letter was as follows:— "Council House, "Wandsworth, S.W. December, 1903. "The Council having had under consideration a report "respecting the condition of water supplied to London, and "the amount of suspended matter contained therein, which is "deposited on the bottom of cisterns if the water is allowed 119 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "to stand, rendering the water unfit for domestic purposes, "the attention of inhabitants in the Borough is called to the "importance of carrying out the By-laws with regard to the "cleansing of cisterns and other receptacles for the storage of "water for domestic purposes, requiring cisterns to be "cleansed once at least in every six months, and at such other "times as may be necessary. Contravention of the By-laws "renders the person responsible for the cleansing of cisterns "or other receptacles liable to penalties. "HENRY GEORGE HILLS, "Town Clerk" In 53 instances notices were served on account of animals being kept so as to be a nuisance, the animals being chiefly poultry. These are frequently kept in small back yards and in some instances allowed to monopolise the whole yard. 26 Smoke nuisances were reported during the year, but no proceedings were taken as all the cases of this nuisance were of a minor character. Notices were, however, served in each case, and the owners or occupiers of the premises warned. 388 soil pipes were repaired, 116 of these being in Clapham, and 197 in Streatham. This nuisance is one which is frequently reported on by the Sanitary Inspectors in consequence of the fact that previous to the passing of the By-laws such soil pipes were constructed of improper materials, and in course of time defects occur which make reconstruction necessary. The number of unclassified nuisances was 792, these including a number of minor nuisances incapable of definite classification. Disinfection. Although the number of cases of infectious diseases notified during the year showed a considerable decrease compared with last year, yet owing to the fact that Measles has now been scheduled as a dangerous infectious disease the total number of rooms disinfected by the sanitary staff has increased from 1,953 in 1902 to 2364 in 1903. 417 of these were in Clapham, 190 in Putney, 765 in Streatham, 382 in Tooting, and 610 in Wandsworth. 1,408 lots of bedding were stoved in the disinfecting apparatus, compared with 1,892 in 1902. All the work has been done at the Disinfecting Station at Bell Lane, Wandsworth, and only in a very few instances have 120 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. complaints been made. The majority of the complaints were very trivial and were due to the fact that the owners did not examine the bedding before removal. All the goods before being placed in the disinfecting chamber are carefully examined and notes made if any stains exist. The 1,408 lots of bedding dealt with comprised the following articles:- 995 beds, 1,070 bolsters. 2,666 pillows, qq6 mattresses, 1,151 palliasses, 1,921 sheets, 1,515 quilts, 922 cushions, 6,665 articles of clothing, 2,967 blankets, 919 carpets, and 2,963 extra articles, a total of 24,750 articles, compared with 44,928 in 1902. 682 rooms were disinfected after Measles and 119 after Tubercular disease of the Lungs. The new Disinfecting Station which it is intended to erect on the Council's land at Tooting will be sufficient for the needs of the Borough for many years. A ground plan of the Station is shown, the various rooms being clearly defined. It was considered necessary to provide a formalin chamber so that articles can be fumigated there which it would be impossible to disinfect in any other way. The present apparatus (a Washington Lyons), has proved so satisfactory that another of the same pattern will be erected. The addition of a wash-house will prove very useful as frequently clothing is in such a condition that it cannot be sent back without washing and drying. Steam will be supplied from the boiler at the Destructor, so that there will be no necessity to use the boiler except in an emergency or when the destructors are not working. The plans have been drawn up by Mr. Marten, the Surveyor for the Eastern District, after consultation with myself, and I feel certain that it will be one of the most complete Disinfecting Stations in the kingdom.

Milkshops. All the milkshops on the register have been inspected during the year, and the register has been carefully revised with the result that it was found that a large number of the smaller dealers had given up selling milk. The actual number on the register in 1903 was 286, 30 having been added to and four removed from the register during the year. In all, 523 inspections were made of these premises, and in 60 notices were served, chiefly for cleansing works. Ice Cream Premises. At the close of 1902 there were 129 premises on the register where Ice Cream was manufactured, 39 were added during the year and 10 removed, leaving 158 premises on the register. 309 inspections of these were made during the year and 48 notices were served. The regulations with regard to the manufacture of Ice Cream have proved of decided utility, all the known premises where this commodity is prepared being now in a satisfactory condition. Cowhouses. The following is a list of the registered cowhouses in the district, granted in October by the London County Council:— Clapham— Adams, John, 8 Chip Street. (Number of cows, Shed No. 1—; No. 2—3).

(26 cows.) 92 inspections of these were made during the year and five intimation notices were served. These were complied with at once, and no statutory notices were necessary. Slaughterhouses. There were 25 slaughter-houses and one knacker's yard on the register in 1902, but two slaughter-house licenses were not applied for in October, 1903, leaving 23 slaughter-houses and one knacker's yard on the register at the end of 1903. During the year 183 inspections of these were made and two notices were served, but no proceedings were necessary. The following list shows the number of slaughter-houses licensed by the London County Council in October, 1903. Clapham— Oxley, Alfred, 63, Clapham Park Road, Clapham. Jarworth, William, 140, Clapham Park Road, Clapham.

No complaints were received with respect to Nos. 1, 2, 4, and 5. Proceedings were taken against the owner of the premises (No. 4) in Bendon Valley, Wandsworth, for contravention of the By-laws and a fine of £5 was inflicted. With regard to No. 3 numerous complaints have been received during the year and proceedings were taken at the Police Court, when the owners were fined £5 and £5:5:0 costs. Against this decision an appeal was lodged at the Quarter Sessions, and the appeal was sustained on the ground that the date of the alleged nuisance was not stated. 127 Report of the Medical Officer of Health The following is a copy of the report of the Solicitor to the Council on the matter:— "WICKENS, PEASE & Co. "This case came before the Court of Quarter Sessions on "Friday last, the 15th instant, Mr. Loveland Loveland, K.C., "sitting as Chairman. "Upon the preliminary objection that the conviction did not "specify the date of the offence, the Chairman decided that the "conviction was bad, and he allowed the Appeal, but made no "order as to payment of costs. "You will recollect that on the 7th October last the defen"dants were convicted of carrying 011 their business so as to cause "a nuisance, and were fined £5 and £5:5:0 costs. On that "occasion there were in all eight summonses before the Magis"trate, but after hearing the case at very great length, the "Magistrate intimated that he was not prepared to convict on "seven of the summonses and that they should be withdrawn. I "thereupon withdrew seven of the summonses, and the Magis"trate convicted the defendants as before-mentioned. "The conviction itself is prepared at the Court, signed by "the Magistrate, and forwarded to Quarter Sessions. Mr. Bird, "the Chief Clerk ot the Court, did, however, send the conviction "to me before the Magistrate signed it, but I saw no reason to sug"gest any alteration therein. "At the Police Court, although there were eight summonses "issued, for eight different offences on specified dates, the Magis"trate allowed, and properly allowed evidence to be called as to "the nuisance on other dates, in order to shew generally the "manner in which the defendants conducted their business, and I "have no doubt that the Magistrate intended his conviction to "cover a period other than the dates specified in the eight sum"mouses, although in remitting the conviction to the Court the "officials forwarded that particular summons. "In addition to the objection to the conviction, Mr. Elliott, "Counsel for the Appellants, intimated that he should object to "any evidence being given outside the particular date mentioned "in the summons and the Chairman stated that he thought that "objection was a good one. 128 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "The difficulty in such a case is obvious. The only evidence "which I was able to obtain of the date mentioned in the summons "was the evidence of the Sanitary Inspector. None of the other "witnesses, of whom there were twenty in number, were able to "give evidence of the nuisance on that date. "If therefore the Chairman had not upheld the objection to "the conviction, he would have pinned the Respondents to a "particular date, and their case would probably have failed, "although the evidence of general conduct included the Vicar of "the Parish, two resident medical men, and many of the principal "owners and occupiers in the locality." It having been brought to the notice of the Council that these premises were without proper drainage, an order was made for the works to be drained into the sewer and this was complied with in September, 1903. Since that date a large number of complaints have been made by the occupiers of houses in the neighbourhood of smell from the sewer gratings in the roadways. This is due to the offensive nature of the effluent from the works, and also to the fact that the effluent is discharged at a temperature above that of ordinary sewage, but not, so far as can be ascertained, above 110 degrees Fahr. A Reeves' ventilating apparatus has been fixed in one of the manholes and this mitigates the smell to some extent. All the ventilating openings and the ventilating shafts have been closed so that the smell is not now so much complained of. The premises are being kept under daily observation and if any further contravention of the By-laws are noticed the matter will be at once reported to the Council. Offensive Trade Refuse. The waste offal from fishmongers, poulterers and butchers was collected by the Council in their own vans and taken to the Destructor, at the charge of 4d. per tin (the Council providing the tins), the refuse was then removed by a firm of Fish Manure Manufacturers, the Council paying for the cartage, the manufacturer making an allowance of 7/- per ton for the waste. The 129 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. number of tins collected during the twelve months, January to December, was 15,477. Great difficulty was experienced by the Council in disposing of this offensive refuse and the Surveyor for the Eastern District was asked to report to the Committee on the matter. The following is a copy of his report:— TO THE CHAIRMAN & MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE. 24th September, 1903. Gentlemen, Collection and disposal of Fish and Butcher's offal. In October, 1901, I was instructed to commence a service of collecting the offal in the Eastern District with a view to burning it at the Dust Destructor at Tooting. This process was carried out for some ten months until the quantity became too large and the heating value of the (summer) house refuse became too low, that it had to be disposed of in a different way. A local man offered to take away the waste and to pay the Council at the rate of 3/- per ton for it; as this would reduce the cost, arrangements were made for him to dispose of the material. After a little while, however, he represented that he could not afford to pay anything, but agreed to take the offal away for nothing, and this continued until the end of July when he refused to receive it without payment. I was consequently obliged to make a temporary arrangement with him of £2 a week ; in the meantime, I looked round to find some reliable firm to deal with the matter and arranged with the Belvedere Fish Guano Company until I could present some scheme to the Council for disposing of it in a more satisfactory manner. The initial cost of the service, including tins and smocks, was £270:15:5, the wages, horse hire and disinfectants, etc., cost £470:6:4, as against receipts during the same time of £344:13:6, leaving a deficiency on the collection account of £125:12:10, this, of course, in addition to the money sunk in the initial cost. The service has been very highly appreciated by the tradesmen, but the result demonstrates the fact that the charge of 4d. per tin is too low. The original recommendation was 6d. and this 130 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. would just about have covered the cost under these circumstances. The Council, however, are in this difficulty, that they cannot get any firm to take away the garbage without payment, and at the present time, are paying the Belvedere Fish Guano Co. about £4 per week, that is, after deducting the value of the material, this of course adds considerably to the cost of the service, and if this were continued, even 6d. per tin would not be sufficient to pay expenses. It is impossible to burn so much garbage at the Destructor. In 1901, I was instituting inquiries as to the possibility of dealing with this material by means of a special drying cylinder, and I found that it was quite possible to do so with the waste heat at the Destructor as done at Bradford. The cost of the plant and suitable buildings would be about £1,000, the annual cost of disposal would therefore be:— £ s. d. Wages— one man @ 27/- 70 0 0 Repayment of loan (say 10 years) 100 0 0 Interest— 3% per cent., average 17 10 0 Repairs and Sundries 12 10 0 £200 0 0 The quantity of manure produced from the weekly collection of offal (12 tons), would be at least two tons per week (probably more), and £3 per ton could be obtained for the manure, this would give a return of £312 per annum, so that the sale would more than cover the cost of disposal and the balance would go to reduce the cost of collection. Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, it is not permitted to establish anew the business of a Manure Manufacturer, but the Medical Officer of Health has, I understand, been in communication with the Medical Officer of Health to the London County Council, and they are of opinion that this could be got over as it is the simplest method of disposing of such offensive material. I have a proposal from a firm named F.S.Hempleman and Co., of West Ham, to undertake to collect and dispose of fish and butcher's waste in the Borough on the following terms:— i3i C Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "To remove the waste every day, leaving empty drums in place of those filled. They propose to charge a minimum of one shilling per week to the small fish shops and to the others a sum estimated on what the shops have paid the Council, when calculated at 4d. per drum." That is to say, they propose to make a fixed weekly charge to each shop based upon what they have already paid to the Council but with the minimum charge as above. They prefer to collect the money direct from the fishmongers themselves. I asked them, "Would you be prepared to give an undertaking to this Council that the charges should not be increased over a limited number of years and what guarantee would you give for the fulfilment of such undertaking?" Their reply is, "We could give an undertaking to do the work on these terms for some definite time if the Council on their part would guarantee to give us all the waste fish in your Borough." They are prepared to give a guarantee for the fulfilment of this. Of course the Council could not guarantee to give the whole of the waste as they have no power to compel tradesmen to send their refuse to any particular place , but the Council might undertake not to collect or employ anyone else to collect same so long as the work was done satisfactorily by the firm in question. This would probably be for the time being the most efficient manner of dealing with it. Yours faithfully, (Signed) H.J.MARTEN, Surveyor. The Courtcil have arranged to enter into a contract with the firm mentioned in the Report of the Surveyor for the removal of the offal to be taken away direct from the shops to the Manure Manufacturers' premises at West Ham, the Contractor providing the labour, horses, vans, and tins. This arrangement will relieve the Council from all cost. Houses-Let-in-Lodgings The number of the above is 200 (31 in Clapham, 6 in Putney, 117 in Streatham, and 46 in Wandsworth). 360 inspections of these were made during the year and 192 notices were served for cleansing and for the abatement of nuisances, 132 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 6 of these were served on account of overcrowding. In consequence of a letter from the London County Council the following report was made to the Committee:— 12th February, 1903. To THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, With reference to the letter from the London County Council calling attention to the fact that in this Borough there are 21,000 houses of five rooms and under, and that only 116 houses have been placed on the Register of Houses-Let-in-Lodgings, I have had an inquiry made into the matter, and an approximate estimate made of the number of houses which would come under the By-laws of Houses-Let-in-Lodgings which are in force in this Borough. In the first place the number of houses which are flats containing five rooms and under must be deducted from the total of 21,000, as these flats do not come under the By-laws. Roughly speaking there are 6,000 flats presently occupied, and this number is rapidly increasing as a considerable proportion of the new houses which are being erected for the working classes, are flats with separate entrances. The total number of houses which come under the By-laws is about 6,300, but about 5,000 of these houses are let to tenants who in turn sub-let. It is almost impossible for the By-laws to be carried out satisfactorily where this latter form of letting is in force, as the tenant who sub-lets is not in a position financially to carry out the requirements, and registration of these, as long as the By-law remains as at present would be of no advantage. It always has been my practice to advise the Committee to place houses on the Register which are occupied by more than two families, but even in those the same difficulty as to the definition of "Landlord" has arisen. 133 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. There are however a large number of houses let to members of more than one family, and which come under the By-laws which it would be advisable to place on the Register when such are not kept in a sanitary condition. It has not been my practice to ask for houses to be placed on the Register which are well looked after by the landlord as I do not think anything would be gained by such registration. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, (Signed) P.CALDWELL SMITH, Medical Officer of Health. The houses in Larch Road, Balham, which were ordered by the Council to be placed on the Register in 1902 and mentioned in the Report for last year have now been placed on the Register. The case came before the Magistrate at the South Western Police Court and the following judgment was delivered by him:— WANDSWORTH BOROUGH COUNCIL v. CURREY. Copy of Judgment delivered by J. Rose, Esq., the Magistrate sitting at the South-Western Police Court, on the 23rd September, 1903. Viewed from outside, the structure in question seems to be an ordinary small dwelling-house. The interior has, however, been altered so as to adapt each floor for use as a flat, and each is occupied by a different family as if it were a flat. But the alterations made by the addition of a kitchen and water-closet to each floor are not in my opinion such as to justify me in finding that the whole structure has ceased to be a " house " and has become a pile of residences as the erection proposed in Rogers v. Hosegood (1900) 2 Ch. p. 393, or a block of flats such as the Artizans Dwellings in Weatherite v. Cautley (1901) 2 King's Bench Division 285, and the mode of use cannot change the nature of the building. 134 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. A structure originally built as one dwelling house might perhaps by sufficient internal changes be converted into flats. It is difficult to distinguish the basement of the house in question from a flat and the difference between the upper storeys of it and the flats in Weatherite v. Cautley consists chiefly in the fact that each upper storey is not shut off from the common staircase by one door only; but my attention has been called to Kyffin v Simmons, 67 J.P. 227, and to Filer v. Thomas, decided by the King's Bench Division on appeal from the Thames Police Court on the 2nd July last, which resemble the case now before me. Each of those cases was, it is true, treated in the Divisional Court, as concluded by the finding of the Magistrate, but I do not consider that I can disregard them on that ground or that I could properly come to another conclusion of fact on evidence which is so similar. Kyffin v. Simmons may perhaps be distinguished by the fact that there was no separate sanitary accommodation for each floor,, but I cannot distinguish the facts in the case before me from those in Filer v. Thomas, in which the Magistrates' finding was treated as conclusive by the King's Bench Division and I feel bound by the findings and decision in that case to determine that the structure now in question is a "house occupied by members of more than one family," and is therefore subject to the provisions of section 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and is a "lodging house" within the definition of the first of the By-laws which purport to have been made by the Sanitary Authority under that Act. I have come to this conclusion with reluctance for the house is not a "lodging house" within the ordinary meaning of the word, and I doubt whether Parliament meant the words " occupied by members of more than one family" in section 94 to extend the provision beyond places of abode occupied in the nature of lodgings as distinguished from other tenements. Neither the Landlord nor any agent of the Landlord lives on the premises or has control over them during the tenancies of the inmates ; yet he will be compelled under these By-laws, to find out as best he can and state truly to the Sanitary Authority inter alia, the manner of use of each room, and the number, age, and 135 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. sex of the occupants of each room used for sleeping; and the tenants must at all times afford the officer of the Sanitary Authority free access to inspect the interior of any room, and be subject to a dozen other By-laws regulating their houses as if they were but little better than the vagrant inmates of a common lodging house. "It is for their own good," said Mr. Young, representing the Sanitary Authority, but the same might be said of the inspection and internal regulation of dwellings of greater value. It is not unlikely that many flats and even highly rented houses in London would be found on inspection to be overcrowded and insanitary, but they will be safe from the Sanitary inquisition because although the Public Health Act, 1891, section 94, does not make any distinction of rental, the By-laws do so, as by By-laws a "lodging house" shall be exempt from the operation of these By-laws (a) where the rent or charge payable by each lodger— is at the rate of eight shillings a week and upwards. Formerly a limitation of that kind must, I think, have invalidated such By-laws, but the more liberal construction now placed on Municipal legislation prevents me from treating By-laws as being ultra vires. I fine the defendant £1 and £4:4:0 costs for offending against this By-law. Customs and Inland Revenue Act. During the year 14 certificates were granted under the above Act.

A new sanitary convenience has been erected by the Council at Tooting Broadway, but additional conveniences are required in other parts of the Borough. This is, however, receiving the attention of the Council, and the question of erecting others is at present under consideration. In January, 1903, the following report was made to the Public Health Committee with respect to the condition of the urinals attached to the public-houses in the Borough. 138 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 29th January, 1903. To THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, I beg to report that during the last fortnight the whole of the urinals in connection with the public-houses in the Borough have been inspected, and with few exceptions have been found to be in a satisfactory condition. In the North Ward of the parish of Clapham there are 50 public-houses, the urinals of which are open to the public in 18; in 22 the urinals are private, that is to say they are only approached through the licensed premises themselves; and in 10 no accommodation is provided on the premises. Of these 10, 7 have public conveniences within a short distance. In three of the public and three of the private, intimation notices were served for minor matters, such as defective flooring, insufficient water, and the foul condition of the urinal, and these have been, or are being complied with. In the South Ward of the parish of Clapham, there are only six licensed premises, one with a public and five with private urinals. These urinals were found to be in a satisfactory condition. In the parish of Putney 30 licensed premises were inspected, 18 of which had public and 12 private urinals. These were all found to be in a satisfactory condition. In the Balham Ward of the parish of Streatham there are 10 licensed premises, eight having public and two private urinals. In two of the public the urinals required cleansing, and in one of these notice was served. The others were in a satisfactory condition. In the Streatham Ward 16 licensed premises were inspected, 12 had public urinals, two private, one had no urinal, and one is at present re-building. All these were in a satisfactory condition with the exception of one, a public one, for which notice was served, and this is being attended to. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 139 In the Tooting Ward 13 premises have been inspected, 11 of these have public urinals, and two premises are at present being re-built. With the exception of one all were in a satisfactory condition. In the Southfield Ward, 19 premises were inspected, eight having public and 11 private urinals. These were all found to be in a satisfactory condition. In the Fairfield Ward 26 premises were inspected, 12 having public and 14 private urinals. All the public ones with the exception of three, and all the private ones with the exception of one were found to be in a satisfactory condition. In the four which were found to be in a unsatisfactory condition, notice was served in one of the cases, and in the other three the insanitary conditions had been attended to without the service of a notice. In the Spripgfield Ward 13 premises were inspected, nine having public, and four private urinals. With the exception of one, these were all found to be kept in a satisfactory condition. This gives a total in the whole Borough of 183 publichouses inspected, 97 of these have public urinals, and 72 have private urinals, one has no urinal at all, and three are being re built. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, (Signed) P. CALDWELL SMITH, Medical Officer of Health. Unsound Food. During the year half a crate of bananas, one box of skate, one hundred mackerel, two boxes of plaice, four boxes of kippers, two trunks of whiting, two trunks of cod, five trunks of haddock, one box of hake, two-and-a-half barrels of fresh herrings, one barrel of sprats, 55 boxes of tomatoes, three baskets of plums, half case of oranges, four pigs, and three pounds of pork were destroyed at. the request of the owners and the usual certificates were granted. 140 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. VENTILATION OF SEWERS. Owing to repeated complaints from the inhabitants in a certain locality in the Borough of offensive smells from the sewers the Council appointed a Sub-Committee, consisting of members of the Public Health and Highways Committees, to consider the whole question This Sub-Committee instructed the Surveyors and myself to report to them on the matter, and these reports were as follows:— Surveyors' Report. In order that the Public Health and Highways Committee may not have to consider two reports on the same subject, we have embodied in this, the substance of one recently made upon a communication by Mr. Councillor Cusden. With one exception, viz., the abolition or otherwise of the interceptor trap at the out-go of the house drain, we entirely concur with the report of the Medical Officer of Health. In the treating of the question of sewer ventilation of a large district such as Wandsworth, we have not to deal with a sewerage system designed as a whole, but one which has grown up piecemeal and which was commenced when local conditions were far different from those existing at present and therefore we have to consider what, short of a wholesale reconstruction will remedy the evils complained of. In a perfect sewerage system, sewage should be conveyed as quickly as possible from house to outfall so as to prevent putrefaction. A constant circulation of air should be provided through every part of sewer and house drain. The sewers should be self cleansing or, where this is impossible, they should be frequently flushed and the deposits removed therefrom. It will be seen from the spot map prepared by Dr. Caldwell Smith, that nearly all the complaints are from streets in the vicinity of the main lines of sewers, whether belonging to the London County Council or the Borough Council, this points to the necessity of dealing specially with these sewers. In the first Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 141 place the ventilation should be independent of the subsidiary sewers and it would be advisable that they should be divided into sections, so that each portion might be separately dealt with. This could be done at intervals of, say, one mile by constructing chambers upon the sewer in such a way that the greater part of the sewer gas generated in any section could be cut off from the section above by means of a hinged flap which would offer little or no obstruction to the flow of sewage in times of flood; each chamber should be provided with a vertical shaft for ventilation, of course providing a sufficient number of surface gratings and upcast shafts between the chambers. The branch sewers might be similarly cut off from the mains in the manholes usually provided at the junctions. This has been done in connection with the London County Council's estate at Totterdown, and it will be interesting to notice the result when the houses are occupied. When the main drainage of London was designed, every house using the sewers contributed towards the ventilation of them, as the interceptor, introduced many years later was unknown. By the adoption of interceptors, the original ventilation of the sewers has been seriously interfered with and no other adequate means have been substituted. The usual condition of sewer and house drains are as follows:— A house drain, as now constructed, is made water-tight and cut off from the sewers by means of an interceptor, a fresh air inlet with mica flap is provided, often near the front door or window and a ventilator carried above the eaves of the house at the rear, great pains are taken to see that the ventilator is gas and water-tight. The assumption is that the inlet, the drain and the upcast shaft at the rear act as a syphon, that only fresh air is admitted in front and that all the foul air ascends the pipe at the highest point of the drain. As a matter of fact, after a very short time, the mica flap is of no use whatever, and when a volume of water is discharged into the drain it draws in fresh air down the tall shaft and discharges foul air from what theoretically should be the fresh air inlet. 142 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 1st. As to the interceptor itself, it is the source of much trouble, it retains a quantity of sewage near the house until decomposition commences and so forms a sewer gas producer and consequently the sewage when it reaches the sewer, is much more foul than if discharged direct. 2nd. It is the cause of most of the stoppages in house drains. 3rd. It prevents a through circulation of air in every part of the sewer and house drain. Assuming for the moment, which is not the case that the sewers themselves are all perfectly ventilated, there remain several branches between them and the interceptors which have no means of ventilation whatever, these therefore form gas holders of considerable magnitude. What is required, is, a proper means of obtaining a circulation of fresh air and consequently a dilution of the foul air in every sewer, branch and house drain; this can be done by abolishing the interceptor (except perhaps where drains pass under dwelling houses) and carrying up all soil and ventilating pipes to a sufficient height to be clear of windows, &c., and retaining the surface road gratings in places, or erecting shafts or columns, of course discharging all waste pipes, &c., over trapped gullies. With all drains and ventilators gas and water-tight and the traps of the water-closets so constructed as to prevent syphonage, no harm could arise from this course especially when the drains are outside the buildings and the evils above enumerated would be overcome. As instances of this there are many systems of combined back drainage in the Borough and on some estates interceptors have been introduced on the main drains, as well as on the branches, there have been many complaints, and not without cause, as to smells from the surface gratings in the streets on such estates, but by taking out the stoppers from the cleansing eye of these interceptors and thus allowing the through current of air between the sewer and the combined main drain, which latter is ventilated at its highest point, the nuisance in nearly every case has been removed. The following resolutions were passed at a Conference of engineers and surveyors to the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis in 1898, which was convened by the late engineer to the London County Council, Sir A. R. Binnie. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 143 (1) That the closing of surface sewer ventilators in response to complaints increases the general evil, the diminution of which is to be attained by the multiplication of the ventilators, at regular frequent intervals. (2) That in connection with any interceptor hereafter fixed on a main house drain, it is advisable to carry a ventilating pipe from the sewer side of the interceptor, up the front, side, or back of the house, to the satisfaction of the Local Sanitary Authority, and that the outlet drain from the interceptor shall not be flap-trapped in sewer unless required by the Local Sanitary Authority. (3) That pipe ventilators up buildings, or otherwise, where possible, should always be adopted in addition to surface ventilation. Similar resolutions were passed at a Conference of representatives of South London Vestries (including members and surveyors), held at the Camberwell Town Hall in May, 1898, with the following addition after the word "ventilators" in the 1st resolution:—"both surface and upcast shafts." When we first came into the district we found that many of the manholes on the sewers were provided with cess-pits with the object of intercepting solid matters, these were a veritable source of nuisance and we filled them up and substituted pipe channels of the same diameter as the sewers. In conclusion we are of opinion that each house should bear its share in ventilating the sewers, whether by means of soil pipes or special pipes as recommended (resolution 2) by the Conference above referred to, but preferably by the former, that the number of surface ventilators and upcast shafts should be increased and that special means of ventilation, as suggested above, should be provided on the main lines of sewers We would recommend that as an experiment, a small estate should be treated on these lines, i.e: — The sewer cut off from the main sewer and properly ventilated. The house drains connected direct to the sewers with inspection chambers at the out-go and the levels so arranged 144 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. that, if found necessary hereafter, intercepting traps could be introduced and fresh air inlets provided. It would probably be necessary to obtain a special dispensation from the London County Council, whose By-laws require the provision of interceptors. H. J. MARTEN, P. DODD, Surveyors. 27th January, 1903. REPORT OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. The ventilation of sewers is a subject that has for many years engaged the attention of sanitarians, and many appliances have been invented to deodorise or destroy the effluvium which indisputably exists in many sewers, but these have not in any instance proved satisfactory. That ventilation is necessary is certain, in spite of the fact that in two towns at least, viz., Bristol and Burton-on-Trent the sewers are unventilated. In properly constructed sewers with a good fall the amount of ventilation required may not be great, as the necessity for it does not exist to the same extent owing to the fact that there is or ought to be no decomposition, but in old brick and pipe sewers where deposit occurs through subsidence or other causes the amount of decomposition is great and gives rise to effluvia offensive in the highest degree. These effluvia consist of a complicated mixture of various gases such as sulphuretted hydrogen, sulphide of ammonium, and carbon bisulphide, along with still more complex carbo-ammonical gases and organic vapours the composition of which is unknown. In addition to these carbonic acid gas, nitrogen, and marsh gas are also present but these are not to any extent the causes of the offensiveness of sewer air. Whether the inhalation of this offensive gas is the cause of any definite and specific illness has not, in my opinion, been conclusively proved, but that it does give rise to headache, nausea, sickness, diarrhoea, and sore throat there is no doubt. The methods adopted in London generally to abate the nuisance arising from sewer gas are similar to those adopted in this Borough, viz., surface ventilators in the middle of the Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 145 way about 100 yards apart, or in lieu of these, shafts 6 inches in diameter either erected in the street or carried up the side or front of the nearest house. To ascertain if these methods were similar to those adopted in provincial towns a series of questions was sent to the Medical Officers of Health of 70 provincial towns and 57 replies have been received. The questions were as follows:— (1).—What methods are adopted in your district for the ventilation of the sewers? (2).—Do you receive many complaints of offensive smells from surface ventilators in the streets ? (3).—Have you ever been able to trace any connection between offensive smells from sewer ventilators and Diphtheria or other disease? (4).—Is each house drain intercepted from the main sewer? (5).—Do you require a ventilator on the sewer side of the intercepting trap? With regard to the first question asked two towns have no sewer ventilation at all, 15 have surface ventilators only, 33 have both surface ventilators and ventilating shafts, and seven have ventilating shafts only. With regard to question 2 in group (1), those towns with no system of sewer ventilation, no complaints were received. In group (2), those with surface ventilators only, with the exception of Huddersfield there have been complaints received, in four the complaints were numerous, in six a few, and in four no additional statement was made beyond recording the fact that complaints had been received. In group (3), those towns with both surface ventilators and ventilating shafts, in two cases no complaints had been received, in 16 a few, and 15 no particular statement was made except that complaints had been received. In group (4), towns with ventilating shafts only, no complaints had been received. In group 3 in many of those towns as the complaints are received ventilating shafts are being fixed and the surface ventilators sealed up. 146 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. With regard to question 3 in four towns the Medical Officers of Health report that they have been able to trace connection between the effluvia from the sewer ventilators and disease. The Medical Officer of Health for Hastings states that he has traced Diphtheria to defective street gullies, but this should not be classed with surface ventilators on account of the fact that in dry weather although the gully may be sealed, if any offensive matter is present decomposition may take place in the gully itself. In West Bromwich the Medical Officer of Health reports that on two occasions he was able to trace a connection, and the Medical Officer of Health for Swansea reports that he has only been able to trace a connection in rare cases. In the other town in which the Medical Officer gave an answer in the affirmative no particulars are given. With regard to intercepting traps, in all the replies the conditions are similar to those existing in London, excepting Hanley, Leicester, Stockport, Northampton, Burnley, Halifax. Warrington, and Salford, where there are no intercepting traps between the house and the sewer. With regard to question 5 a negative answer has been given in the majority, but the Medical Officers of Health of Grimsby, Northampton, Leicester, Hastings, Birkenhead, and Croydon. reply in the affirmative. In Stockport and Burnley such ventilating shafts are required if an interceptor is used. An examination of the death-rates from all causes and the death-rate from Diphtheria in 1901 in the towns comprising the above four mentioned groups throws little light on the casual relationship between ventilation of sewers and either the general health of the community or the prevalence of Diphtheria. For example Bristol with no ventilators had a Diphtheria death-rate of .38, Huddersfield with surface ventilating shafts only had a deathrate of .06, and Great Yarmouth with ventilating shafts only had a death-rate of .76 per thousand. Again, Hastings, with ventilating shafts only had a death-rate from Diphtheria of .09 and Cardiff with surface ventilators had a rate of .47 per thousand. The following Table shows the death-rate from all causes and from Diphtheria for the year 1901 for these 57 towns, and also for the Borough of Wandsworth, Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 147 Death-Rate from all causes and Diphtheria.

Of these, eight were in the parish of Clapham, 17 in Putney, 57 in Streatham, 12 in Tooting, and 25 in Wandsworth. A spot map of the whole Borough showing the position of the ventilators complained of has been prepared, and on the same map is shown the position of the main sewerage system in the Borough I have personally inspected many of these streets and the ventilators complained of. In a few the nuisance still existed on the occasion of my visit, but as in the great majority such smell is paroxysmal no nuisance could be traced on the occasion of my visit. Every complaint received in the Public Health Department was forwarded to the Surveyor of the district and was attended to. In the Garratt Lane main sewer the odour at some times was very overpowering and there is no doubt in my mind that the sewer gas from this main sewer, instead of following the main course of the water, ascends from the low levels to the branch sewers at higher levels, causing offensive odours in streets at a distance from such sewer. At one time numerous complaints were received from residents in Earlsfield Road and the streets in Allfarthing Lane, but since the closing of the ventilators in the streets and the erection of ventilating shafts such complaints have largely diminished. I feel certain that such sewer gas in the majority of cases is not generated in the pipe drains which exist in the new streets off Allfarthing Lane and Earlsfield Road, but is generated in the large sewer. Similarly the sewer gas in some of the streets in Putney cannot be generated in the sewers belonging to the Borough Council as in some streets, notably Clarendon Road, there can be no deposit, and sewer gas is not generated in fresh sewage. Other examples might be cited in other parts of the Borough, but in regard to this the Surveyors are more capable of giving an opinion than myself. The crux of the whole question is, what means ought to be taken to prevent the sewer gas from being a nuisance. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 149 The replies received from other towns show that in a considerable proportion such complaints have been received, and that in the majority of these the surface ventilators are being closed and shafts erected in their place. That this does away with the complaints is certain so far as can be ascertained from the replies received, but whether it is the best means is a difficult question to answer. The first desideratum is doubtless to have thoroughly well laid sewers and frequent flushing of the same. The second, to have manholes in the roadway where it is of sufficient width, and there is no doubt that in that position there is less risk to passers-by as sewer gas is very quickly diluted with fresh air and has little chance of entering dwelling houses. If offensive odours are being given off then the sewer at that part should be flushed and cleansed, as the presence of sewer gas shows that a deposit has taken place and consequent decomposition. There is not much use in flushing a sewer at a distance from such deposit, but the deposit should be located and removed. In addition to surface ventilators the construction of shafts as is done at present is the only other alternative, but whether to supplement the surface ventilators or to take their place must depend upon circumstances. If the roadway is narrow and the production and emission of sewer gas is frequent then the surface ventilators ought to be closed. All dead ends of sewers ought to be ventilated by means of these shafts, and numerous examples exist in the Borough of the nuisance having been abated in this way. I am, however, of opinion that the more frequent repair, removal of deposit, and flushing of the main sewers is an absolute sine qua non, and until this is carried out the generation of sewer gas will continue and little or no improvement can possibly result. The smell may be bottled up or discharged at higher levels, but nothing short of the removal of the causes will be satisfactory from a sanitary aspect. Other methods have been suggested for the ventilation of main sewers, such as a ventilating pipe on the house drain on the sewer side of the intercepting trap, but this is open to one great 150 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. objection, viz.:—that in times of heavy rain when ventilation is most required the house drain is frequently running half full and consequently the sectional area available for ventilation is much reduced. Another method of ventilating the sewer by means of the house drain unprovided with an intercepting trap is open to the same objection and also to the more serious one that if the drain is in any way defective, sewer gas will find its way into the house, more especially if such drain, as is frequently the case, runs under the house. The deodorisation of sewer gas by means of chemicals or gas burners has also been tried and found ineffective, the latter method being not only useless but very expensive. The only zymotic disease that has been suggested as in any way caused by emanations from sewers is Diphtheria, and although I have carefully examined the localities where such emanations are complained of I have been unable to come to the conclusion that this disease has been in any way directly caused by such emanations. At first sight, it would appear that such causation could be proved, but the experience of last year with regard to the outbreak on the Hyde Farm estate and also in certain localities in Wandsworth has forced me to adopt a different view as to the causation of the disease. There is no question, however, that the constant inhalation of air impregnated with sewer gas gives rise to a lessened vitality and renders the system more liable to attacks of other diseases, and especially is this true of Diphtheria, and sore throat of a non-diphtheritic character, but that the casual inhalation of sewer gas can give rise to any specific disease is, in my opinion, improbable. P. CALDWELL SMITH, Medical Officer of Health. 29th January, 1903. After consideration of these reports the Sub-Committee reported to the Council as follows: — Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 151 REPORT OF JOINT SUB-COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND HIGHWAYS COMMITTEE ON THE VENTILATION OF SEWERS. The Joint Sub-Committee consisting of the following Members of the Public Health Committee, Alderman Anderson, Councillors Gay and Swain, and of the Highways, Sewers, and Lighting Committee, Councillors Lance, Lorden, and Wise, appointed to enquire into the question of the ventilation of sewers has held five Meetings at which were also present The Mayor, Councillor Cusden (by invitation), the Medical Officer of Health, and the Surveyors. The Committee has mainly considered the best method of ventilating sewers to avoid complaints arising from them, and what, if any, definite plan can be devised for the closing of road gratings and erection of shafts. The Committee had before it a report from the Medical Officer of Health with tables compiled from inquiries as to the conditions existing in the large towns in Englands, and spot maps shewing the incidence of diseases and localisation of complaint from the Surveyors with plans and maps of the sewers in the Borough and several letters from Mr. Councillor Cusden advocating the necessity of closing all road gratings and removing the interceptor traps on house drains, thus allowing the soil pipe ventilators of private houses to act as a large additional number of shafts, and the best arrangement for connecting the usual shafts to the crown of the sewers. After careful examination of all the points, the following statements and suggestions are made for the future management of the sewers, and of complaints in connection with them. i.—That while there is clear evidence of the production by sewer air of sore throat, gastro-intestinal disturbances and indefinite forms of disease, and of lowered vitality predisposing to disease, more especially when carried into houses, there is no modern evidence to show that such specific diseases as Diphtheria or Enteric Fever are caused by its inhalation, but on the contrary, in such diseases there is probably an entirely different cause. 152 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 2.—That the proper cleansing of the drains and traps requires the provision of flushing cisterns of a larger capacity than at present permitted and that in new buildings there should be regulation as to the minimum internal diameter of the feed pipes of the flushing cisterns at present in use, in accordance with the head of water. 3.—That there is clear evidence to show that sewer air runs along the crown of the sewer and that it does not follow any constant direction, that it sometimes descends with the sewage and sometimes ascends the sewers and will find exit by openings at certain distances from its source, and particularly at the dead ends and on the main lines of sewers. 4.—That the course of the sewer air and its retention in or exit from a sewer depends, in the absence of artificial means of ventilation, on the temperature and humidity of the outside air, and the direction of the prevailing winds. 5.—That the proper ventilation of drains and the prevention of nuisance arising in connection with it requires:— (a) Sufficient fall of sewer in all cases where possible to secure self cleansing. (b) Sufficient flushings by water. (c) Free admission of air to the sewers. 6.—That while it would undoubtedly improve the ventilation of sewers if the interceptor trap on the house drains were removed. it would at present be impossible, on account of the certain opposition of the public, to adopt such a system. In case of combined drainage the interceptor in the main drain should be omitted and a ventilating shaft put at the summit of the drain. 7.—That it is necessary to ventilate not only the sewer, but the branches opening into it between the interceptor trap and the sewer. With regard to the practical means to be taken to ventilate sewers and at the same time to prevent a nuisance the Committee has given much consideration to the question of closing all the surface ventilators and constructing more tall shafts. In favour of this policy is the fact of the complaints of nuisances—smells— from these gratings, and that two towns (Bristol and Burton-on- Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 153 Trent) are stated to have no arrangements for ventilation of sewers whatever and that seven have no surface ventilators and that they experience no difficulty. On the other hand it has been shewn the number of gratings complained of in the Borough in one year was 123, that there are 1,581 such gratings open, a percentage of only about eight per cent., and although the smell may be disagreeable, it is not necessarily dangerous and is as far from the houses as possible, and is soon diluted by fresh air. That it is necessary to provide ample fresh air in the sewers themselves and that this cannot be efficiently done by tall shafts only. That it is necessary to allow for the air expelled by sudden influxes of sewage and storm water into sewers which might in the absence of surface gratings, be forced through the interceptor traps of house drains and so give rise to greater nuisance than at present. That sufficient tall shafts to equal the area of the road gratings would mean a very large addition to the present number and that they would be less efficient on account of the height of the column of air, and further, cases have been mentioned of nuisance from these tall shafts in certain conditions of the atmosphere. It is impossible to compare the conditions of London with those in other towns. The Committee therefore makes the following recommendations:— That ventilating columns or shafts be placed— (a) at the dead ends of sewers, (b) elsewhere where found necessary, arranged to rise from the crown of the sewer by a conical or bell-shaped enlargement. That it is advisable to have, in some cases, these shafts proceeding from the house drain between the interceptor and the sewer, the sewer flap trap being omitted. That in case of combined drainage the interceptor on the main drain should be omitted and a ventilating shaft or column fixed at the summit of the drain. That wherever possible dead ends of sewers should be made to communicate with other sewers in the neighbourhood. 154 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. That in view of the impossibility of predicting the points of the sewers other than those referred to above at which a nuisance from smell is likely to occur, no definite rule can be laid down for erecting shafts on the sewage system, therefore the plan of closing road gratings that may be reasonably complained of and the erection of shafts in their place is at present the best method. (Signed) JOHN GAY, Chairman. BY-LAWS. A letter was received from the London County Council relative to the desirability of amending the By-laws under Sections 16 and 39 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and asking for a statement of any points on which this Council required amendment. This letter was considered by the Public Health Committee and the following suggestions were forwarded to the London County Council. BY-LAW UNDER SECTION 16 (2). By-law 1. That the time prescribed for the removal of fdecai or offensive matter in or through London be from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. all the year round, and that the County Councils whose districts adjoin London be asked to amend their times accordingly. The hours prescribed by the existing by-law No. 1 are from 4 to 10 a.m. in March, April, May, June, July, August, September, and October, and from 6 a.m. to 12 noon in November, December, January, and February. BY-LAWS UNDER SECTION 39 (1). By-law i. That this by-law should (as already suggested by the Council) be amended so as to prohibit Jhe reduction of the open space about water-closets to less than the minimum area prescribed, and that the open space referred to in the by-law shall belong exclusively to the premises in which it is proposed to construct a water-closet Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 155 By-law 3. That a clause be inserted providing for the capacity of flushing cisterns to be not less than three gallons. By-law 14. That the words "forty-eight hours" be added after the word "given" in the third line. By-law 16. That a clause be inserted,— (a) For the prohibition of a shoot to any receptacle for house refuse. (b) For providing that in flats and other similar tenements on each floor there should be a balcony or open space for movable receptacles for house refuse. By-law 25. That a clause be inserted (as already suggested by the Council) requiring owners of property let as stables to provide manure receptacles. Provided that, where a wagon or van, fitted on wheels, is used in place of a receptacle or metal cage, and is removed (together with its contents) periodically, without in any way disturbing the contents of such wagon or van the provision of such wagon or van shall be deemed, under such conditions, to comply with all the requirements of this by-law. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. The registers which had been in use for reports of workshops, etc., were found not to be satisfactory, and after careful consideration it was decided to adopt a card system on which the information with respect to workshops could be more easily kept and become more accessible. A separate card is used for each workshop "and space is left for the necessary particulars, the reverse being used for reinspections. Cards are also used for factories, workplaces, domestic workshops, outworkers' premises, and milkshops. 156 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Since the adoption of this system all the workshops in the Borough have been re-inspected and the returns are this year more exact and complete. This re-inspection caused a considerable amount of extra work to be thrown on both the inspectorial and clerical staff of this department, but I anticipate that in future the work will in consequence be much lessened as only the new workshops will require measuring, those already on the register having been this year measured and the cubic capacity of each room entered on the card. New Tables have also been prepared for insertion in this Report, and these show more clearly and definitely not only the amount of work done, but also show details which were not given in any previous Report. UNDERGROUND BAKEHOUSES. The work of dealing with these during the year has been so important that it is desirable to devote some space to it, and to give in detail the requirements for the certificate of suitability as determined by the Council. In 1902 a list of all the underground bakehouses was laid before the Public Health Committee with particulars stating the measurement and cubic capacity of each bakehouse, the area of window space, the number of persons employed, and the nature of the material used for walls, floors, and ceilings. Plans of every underground bakehouse were made by the Sanitary Inspectors and these have been preserved for reference. After visiting all these underground bakehouses, and after consideration of the requirements which were being proposed by the Metropolitan Society of Medical Officers of Health and those issued by some provincial Sanitary Authorities, a list of requirements was drawn up and submitted to the Committee. These requirements were very carefully considered by the Committee and after discussion the following requirements were submitted to the Council and passed by it without serious alteration. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 157 REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO UNDERGROUND BAKEHOUSES. (a) That the bakehouse shall be of a minimum capacity of 1,500 cubic feet, and shall be in every part thereof at least 7 feet 6 inches high, measured from the floor to the ceiling. (b) The surface of the walls shall be smooth and impervious throughout. Every wall of the bakehouse shall be constructed with an approved damp course, and if in contact with the soil shall be effectually secured against dampness from that soil. (c) The ceilings shall be ceiled with smooth and impervious material. (d) The floors shall be composed of Portland cement concrete mixed in the proportion of one part Portland cement to six parts of clean Thames ballast at least six inches thick over the entire surface. The surface shall be finished smooth with a ¾-inch layer of Portland cement and granite chippings to pass ¼-inch gauge, mixed in equal proportions, or of other impervious material, to the satisfaction of the Authority. (e) Any drain or sewer under the bakehouse shall be constructed of gas and water tight pipes. No gully shall be within the bakehouse. No certificate will be granted to any bakehouse which is subject to flooding from drains or sewers. (f) Provision shall be made for suitable means of access (other than by ladder) to the underground bakehouse, in the form of convenient stairs with an external entrance, if practicable. Where it is not possible to have a suitable entrance, except from the shop, such entrance may be allowed with a properly lighted covered-in staircase, so as to exclude dust and dirt. (g) All areas, whether for lighting or draining the bakehouse, shall be constructed with white glazed brick or tiled faces. Light:— (h) The underground bakehouse shall be supplied with one or more windows, so as to be efficiently lighted in every part by daylight by means which shall exclude the entrance of street dust. Such windows shall have a total superficies clear of the sash frames equal to at least one-tenth of the floor space. Where it is 158 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. impossible to have every part efficiently lighted by the prescribed amount of daylight additional external artificial light may be allowed. Ventilation:— (i) The bakehouse shall be properly and effectually ventilated to the satisfaction of the Sanitary Authority by permanent inlets and outlets, other than the windows, communicating directly with the open air in such a way and at such a height above the street level as to prevent the entrance of street dust and dirt. At least one of such outlets shall be over an oven door. If required by the Authority artificial means of ventilation shall be provided. All Other Respects:— (j) Dough-troughs, and all similar furniture or fittings (if any), shall be mounted on strong castors, or wheels, so as to be readily moveable for cleaning purposes. (k) Provision for the proper storage of flour shall be made elsewhere than in the underground bakehouse itself, but storage sufficient for two days consumption of flour may be permitted in the bakehouse, provided that the required minimum cubic capacity is not thereby reduced. (l) Properly covered receptacles shall be provided for the storage of all refuse matters, and such receptacles shall be emptied and cleansed at least once in every 24 hours. (m) No animal shall be kept in or allowed access to an underground bakehouse. (n) There shall not be in direct communication with the bakehouse any coal or other cellar, room, unpaved yard, or area which may be a nuisance or may cause contamination by foul air, dust or dirt. (o) The water supply for the bakehouses should be drawn from the rising main. (p) Conveniences for personal ablution shall be provided in a suitable position, but not within the bakehouse, and shall include a water-tap and a sink or lavatory-basin of an approved character. (q) Proper provision shall be made for the depositing of wearing apparel, not within the bakehouse. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 159 (r) Before making any alterations with a view to meeting these requirements, the owners or occupiers of underground bakehouses shall submit to the Sanitary Authority a specification and plans of the alterations which they purpose making. A copy of these requirements was forwarded to the occupiers of all the underground bakehouses in the Borough and the Sanitary Inspectors were instructed to inform them that every assistance would be given them to carry out these requirements. The amount of work that was done by the Inspectors was very great, but I was able to report that in no case was there any friction caused, although in all cases the work to be done necessarily meant a large expenditure by the owners or occupiers of these premises. The following report was presented to the Committee in December, 1903:— "17th December, 1903. "TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE. "Gentlemen, "I am now able to report that all the underground bake"houses in the Borough have been dealt with, and certificates "granted in all cases where the requirements drawn up by the "Council have been carried out. "In the original list laid before this Committee there were 61 "bakehouses which were considered to be underground,—15 in Clapham, 16 in Putney, 14 in Streatham, and 16 in Wandsworth. "In the parish of Clapham, of the 15 on the list, in regard to "three, it was decided, after further inspection and consultation "with the Solicitor to the Council, that they did not fall within the "definition of underground bakehouses. "At two premises new bakehouses were built above ground. "Ten certificates were granted and also one to the occupier of "No 11A, The Pavement, which was afterwards added to the list l60 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "One bakehouse will be closed as the occupier has another ''bakehouse above ground. "In the parish of Putney the occupiers of three of the 16 "bakehouses on the list have not applied for certificates; in all the "others, with one exception, the requirements have been carried "cut and certificates have been granted. In one case the Com"mittee decided to adjourn the consideration of the alterations to "be made for six months under the exceptional circumstances. "In the parish of Streatham, of the 14 bakehouses, the "occupier of one has not applied. Certificates have been granted "to the occupiers of the remaining 13. "In the parish of Wandsworth, of the 16 bakehouses the "occupiers of two do not intend to apply for the certificate. In "the case of the other 14, certificates have been granted to 13, the "owner of the other one having constructed a new bakehouse "above ground. "The total number of underground bakehouses in the "Borough, to which certificates have been granted, is 48, three "new bakehouses have been built above ground, 7 have not "applied for certificates, and one case has been adjourned. 'In connection with the alterations made, no less than 1,246 "visits were made by the Sanitary Inspectors, and I personally "visited every bakehouse two or three times. The alterations "that have been made were, in a large proportion, of a structural "character and were carried out by the owners or occupiers in a "most satisfactory manner. The requirements have been, in " every case, carried out to my satisfaction, and as every bakehouse " had to be dealt with on its own merits, the amount of work in 'each individual bakehouse differed according to its original "condition. "In all, additional means of ventilation were required; in all, "with the exception of a very few, additional light had to be pro"vided; and in the majority of cases, the structural alterations "were of a serious character. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 161 "I feel certain that the condition of the underground bake"houses in this Borough will compare most favourably with those "in any other Metropolitan Borough. "I am, Gentlemen, "Your obedient Servant, "P. CALDWELL SMITH, " Medical Officer of Health.

All the other bakehouses, 115 in number, were regularly inspected and the necessary cleansing carried out in the months of April and October. SUMMARY OF WORK DONE DURING 1903. In the Tables which follow the whole of the work done is summarised. Table LII. shows the total number on the register at the end of 1902, the number added and removed in 1903, the total number on the register at the end of 1903, the number of notices (intimation and statutory) served, and the number of prosecutions, Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 163 The total number of workshops on the register was 1,486, including 390 domestic workshops, 155 retail bakehouses, 129 laundries, and 812 other workshops, but not including 202 factories, 671 workplaces, and 317 outworkers' premises. Including all factories, workshops, workplaces, and outworkers' premises, there are now on the register 2,676 premises, comprising 4,032 rooms, of which 1,244 were added in 1903. The number of inspections made during the year was 5,554 and the number of notices served, which include 68 statutory and 473. intimation, was 541. The total number of prosecutions was five, particulars of which are given in the Table of Police Court proceedings. Under the head of other workshops is included domestic workshops, and under the head of places where food is prepared for sale is included the kitchens of hotels, restaurants, tripe, fried fish and eel shops, and other places where food is prepared. The number of visits to workshop bakehouses was very large, but this was owing to the special inspections of underground bakehouses and the supervision of the work being carried out in them to comply with the requirements of the Council. In future years this number will be much less, the average number of visits to each bakehouse being about four per annum. The same applies to factory bakehouses, the three in which alterations were being made necessitating about 65 visits. The total number of nuisances found during the year was 667, while 13 were notified by the Inspectors of the Home Office. These necessitated the service of 516 notices, all of which with the exception of five were remedied without legal proceedings. In the five cases in which legal proceedings were taken the nuisances were also abated. 25 notices were served for breach of sanitary requirements in bakehouses, but these were all for not having the bakehouse cleansed at the proper time and were complied with forthwith. In all 705 matters were dealt with and 704 remedied, but it was only necessary to serve 541 notices for two reasons. First a large number was abated without service of notice, as for example in the case of overcrowding in workshops only nine notices were 164 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. served in 29 cases of overcrowding, the majority of the cases being remedied by the Inspectors at the time of inspection and no notice was necessary, and the amount of overcrowding was not serious. Secondly, one notice often called attention to more than one nuisance, as e.g., the workshop might be dirty and the watercloset apartment also, and in addition the water-closet might be out of order or the yard paving might be defective. In these cases only one notice would be served, mention being made, however, of each separate nuisance. This is only enumerated in one notice in the number given in the column headed " notices issued." The one notice which was not complied with by the 31st December was served in December 1903.

Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The total number of premises inspected was 1,384 and reinspected 2,127. 447 of the inspections were in Clapham, 226 in Putney, 338 in Streatham, 57 in Tooting, and 316 in Wandsworth. The small number in Tooting is due to the fact that there is only a small number of workshops in that sub-district at present. Factory and Workshops Act, 1901. TABLE LIV. Clapham. Putney. Streatham.

The total number of premises visited and inspected was 2,367, compared with 1,429 in 1902. 80 inspections were made of factories, 1,181 of workshops 286 of domestic workshops, 405 of workplaces, and 158 of outworkers' premises, while 257 houses were visited for inquiry and no workroom found. The number of workshops inspected and re-inspected was 1,181, compared with 783 in 1902, of domestic workshops and workplaces 693 in 1903 and 301 in 1902, and of outworkers' premises 158 in 1903 and 138 in 1902, Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 169 There were 22 cases of overcrowding discovered, compared with eight in 1902, but only six notices were necessary, the other cases being dealt with by the Inspector at the time of her visit. 86 workrooms were found to be in a dirty condition and seven to be insufficiently ventilated. These nuisances were all remedied shortly after the Inspector's visit. In the 134 separate nuisances in workshops discovered by the Inspector it was only necessary for 61 intimation and 10 statutory notices to be served, and it was not necessary in any case to have recourse to legal proceedings. 69 workshops where females were employed were reported to H.M. Inspector on discovery, and 19 workshops were reported by H.M. Inspector to this Council. Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. TABLE LVI. Clapham. Putney. Streatham. Tooting. Wandsworth. Total.

Re-port of the Medical Officer of Health. I71 Table LVII. shows the number of factories, workshops, domestic workshops, and outworkers' premises on the register in 1902, the number removed from, the number added during 1903, and the number on the register at the end of 1903. The number of workrooms in workshops and workplaces is also shown. The factories and workshops are divided into dressmakers' and milliners' premises, laundries, and miscellaneous premises. Of the total number of factories where women are employed 57 are laundries and nine other factories, while of the total workshops, viz.:—462, 298 are dressmakers and milliners, 375 are laundries, and 63 miscellaneous. The total number of domestic workshops on the register in 1902 was 177 and 245 in 1903. Nearly all the occupiers of these are dressmakers or milliners. The number of workplaces has increased from 116 to 366. These are all small laundries which do not come under the Act, but which are registered as workplaces. It is most necessary that such places should be regularly inspected. 274 of these were found to be in a dirty condition and one insufficiently ventilated. 34 notices were served under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 for the abatement of these nuisances and all were abated.

At the close of 1902 there were 208 premises on the outworkers' register. 115 were added in 1903 and six were removed leaving a total of 317 on the register at the close of the year. The number of lists received during the year is shown on Table LIX. Up to the 1st February 51 lists were received containing the names of 175 outworkers, and between February and August 35 lists were received containing the names of 107 outworkers. The names of 89 outworkers were sent to the Medical Officers of Health of other sanitary districts. The following list gives the name of the district and the number of outworkers sent to each: — 1?4 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The names of 115 outworkers were received from the Medical Officers of Health of other sanitary districts during the year. 1 go inspections were made of outworkers' premises and 14 notices were served, chiefly for cleansing the workrooms. Table LIX. also shows the nature of the work carried on at home. During the year 10 cases of infectious diseases were notified as occurring in the homes of outworkers, seven of Scarlet Fever, two of Diphtheria, and one of Erysipelas. The necessary disinfection was carried out in every case.

Every endeavour has been made to ascertain where homework is carried on and to inform all employers that it is necessary to send in a fresh list at the statutory periods, but failure to do so has occurred in many instances. I have advised the Council to print a circular calling the attention of all employers of labour to this section of the Act, and I trust that in future years the lists will be more punctually forwarded to this Authority. A general survey of all the Tables shows that the amount of work performed by the staff with regard to workshops has been this year been very great, and I am satisfied that there are very few in the Borough which have not been inspected. The general sanitary conditions with few exceptions was found to be very satisfactory. The only real difficulty that has arisen during the year has been the provision of sanitary conveniences for both sexes in small workshops, and also in lock-up shops. Generally speaking the former has been remedied by the provision of an additional watercloset, and the latter either by the erection of a new water-closet for each shop or for a number of workshops grouped together. In one or two instances where the shops were the property of a Railway Company the occupiers were permitted to use the waterclosets in connection with the adjoining railway station free of charge. STATEMENT OF WORK UNDER THE SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. During the past year 729 samples of Foods and Drugs were submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Of these 90, or I2'3 per cent, were reported to be adulterated. In 61 cases proceedings were taken against the vendors of adulterated articles, and in the other 29 cases the Council, taking into consideration the circumstances of the purchase and the low percentage of adulteration decided not to prosecute. The total amount received in penalties under the above Acts was £88 : 5 : o; and the costs recovered amounted to £28 : 15:0, making a total of £ 117. 176 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In 1902 only 23 samples of milk, or 10 per cent, of the total number taken were reported adulterated, while in 1903 65 samples, or I7'2 per cent, were reported not to be up to the standard of the Board of Agriculture. Samples of milk were taken at the Public Institutions in the Borough, at the various railway stations, and in course of transit from the farmers to the retailers during the year. That the adulteration has not been entirely confined to the retail milk vendors the following Table shows. Samples taken on delivery at Public Institutions and Railway Stations: — TABLE LX11I. Premises. Number of Samples taken. Number Adulterated. Percentage of Adulterations. Public Institutions 14 2 14.2 Railway Stations 17 5 29.4 51 samples of milk were taken on Sundays in the early morning, six of which, or 9 8 per cent, were reported to be adulterated. It is satisfactory to be able to report a decided improvement in the percentage of adulteration in the samples of butter submitted for analysis, the figures in 1902 being 8'6 per cent, and in 1903 it has dropped to 4'4. This is a large measure due to the state of the Butter market throughout the year. The past year has has been an exceptional one as Butter was purchased by the Inspector at ninepence per pound and such Butter was certified by the Public Analyst to be genuine. Under the heading of Grocery the percentage of adulteration has gone up from 2'2 per cent, in 1902 to 13 82 in 1903. Of these, eight samples, or 8' 5 per cent, of the total number of grocery samples adulterated, were Coffee. 180 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The Drugs samples submitted also showed a falling off, for whereas in 1902 no adulteration was detected, the percentage of adulteration in 1903 was in. Here it is only right to point out that whereas in the former year only two samples of Drugs were submitted for analysis 27 samples were submitted during 1903. Under the headings Bread and Cereals and Alcoholic Beverages all the samples submitted were certified to be genuine. During the year a considerable increase was made in the number of samples submitted for analysis, viz.:—from 584 in 1902 to 729 in 1903. Where possible samples were purchased by deputy, and for this purpose different members of the disinfecting staff have been at various times utilised, and also the service of a female assistant to purchase grocery samples late on Friday and Saturday evenings. In the subsequent proceeding at the Police Court considerable difficulty has been experienced in obtaining convictions against the large retail firms. A special defence is invariably set up which consists of pleading the warranty under which the milk is sold with the also invariable result that the summons is dismissed. This question of pleading warranties is becoming a more serious one each year. It is now a general practice with all the large firms, and many of the smaller firms are following their lead. In the course of a few years it will become well-nigh an impossibility to obtain a conviction against a dishonest milk vendor except in those cases where the defendants are too poor to bear the cost of the proceedings. The necessity for an alteration of the law with respect to warranty is shown in Case No. 408, where a summons was issued against a farmer for giving a false warranty, in which the summons was dismissed by the Magistrate. The defendant proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the milk was delivered at the railway station by his servant as drawn from the cow, and yet a sample taken in this Borough showed 10 per cent, of fat deficient. It is quite a probable explanation that the milk had been tampered with between the railway stations as the churns are not locked and are kept for some time at these stations. The churns ought to be securely fastened by padlock or seal so that no adulteration in transit could occur, Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 181 As to the question of warranty there is one satisfactory change that could be made, and that is the total abolition of the warranty. I am certain that this would be supported by the farmers as it is quite unfair to make them responsible for the condition of milk when sold by the retailer. The Tables which follows shows the number of samples of Milk, Butter, Coffee, other Groceries, Drugs, Alcoholic Beverages, and Bread and Cereals taken ; the number adulterated ; the percentage of adulterations, as well as the number of samples purchased by the Inspector personally and by deputies, with the respective adulterations.

This would seem to be an argument against the employment of a deputy, but if the Table is more closely studied it will be seen that almost all the adulterated samples procured by the Inspector were samples of milk, and these were chiefly purchased on the street where the dealer could not possibly refuse to sell. Exclusive of milk 353 samples were taken, of which 25 or 7.0 per cent, were adulterated. 71 of these were taken by the Inspector and only three or 4.2 per cent, were found to be adulterated. 282 samples were purchased by deputy and of these 22 or 7 8 per cent, were found to be adulterated. Another question which has been a vexed one during the year has been the very inadequate fines which have in many cases been inflicted by the Magistrate. A reference to the Table of proceedings taken, in which the offence is detailed and the amount of fine specified, shows that the amount of fine inflicted bears in many cases no direct proportion to the seriousness of the offence. The Council, on the recommendation of the Public Health Committee, called the attention of the Home Secretary to these inadequate fines. In conclusion, I am pleased to be able to report that the whole of the work of the Department was carried out by the Inspectors and the Clerical Staff to my entire satisfaction. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, P. CALDWELL SMITH. Medical Officer of Health. APPENDIX.

The above Table shows that I7.28 per cent, of the milk samples and 4'4 per cent, of the butter samples were more or less impure. This indicates a falling off in the case of the milk samples, from io per cent, of impurity in the yeai 1902. In the case of the butter there is, however, an improvement, the percentage of impurity having fallen from 8'6 in 1902 to 4'4 in 1903. II. Groceries. These included: — Coffee 29 samples.

Cocoa 30 per cent, sugar, 25 per cent. arrowroot, sago,, etc. Malt Vinegar 100 per cent, coloured acetic acid. The above Table shows that the samples of Groceries yielded 13 82 per cent, of impurity. This indicates a considerable falling off, as in 1902 the percentage of impurity was only 2"2. III. Drugs. Under this head were included : — Pilulas Ferri 5 samples. Lime Water 5 ,, Milk of Sulphur 3 ,, Tincture of Ferric Chloride 3 ,, Linseed Meal 4 ,, Gregory's Powder 2 „ Ammoniated Tincture of Quinine 2 ,, Camphorated Oil 1 ,, Sal Volatile 1 ,, Liquorice Powder 1 ,, 27 samples. Of these, the following three were adulterated : —- Lime Water ... 75 per cent, deficient in Lime. Lime Water ... 30 „ Pilulae Ferri ... Deficient in Ferrous carbonate to the extent of 66 per cent. This shows that of the samples of Drugs analysed, in per cent, were found to be more or less impure. In the year 1902, two samples were submitted under this head, and both proved to be genuine. 196 Report—Public Analyst. IV. Bread and Cereals. The following were included under this head: — Flour 13 samples. Oatmeal 5 Bread 4 22 samples. As in 1902, all the samples submitted under this head were found to be genuine. V. Alcoholic Beverages. Five samples of Whiskey were examined and all were proved genuine. Whiskey 5 samples. In 1902, 10 per cent, of impurity in this division was recorded. In conclusion, I may add that the Food and Drug Supply of the Borough has retrograded during the year, the percentage of impurity having increased from 87 in 1902 to 1234 in 1903 ; but I am inclined to think that this result is probably due, not so much to actual deterioration in the Food Supply of the Borough, as to the more active measures which have been taken to detect adulteration.
