To the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham, Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you my Annual Report on the vital statistics and the conditions affecting the health of the district for the year 1898. The statistics of Marriages, Births, Deaths and Infectious Diseases relate to the 52 weeks ending December 31st, 1898. POPULATION. The population of Fulham as enumerated at the Census taken on March 29th, 1896, was 113,781, having increased from 91,640 during the preceding 10 years. The population in the middle of 1898, as estimated on the hypothesis that the rates of increase which prevailed between 1891 and 1896 have been maintained since, was 125,275. AGE AND SEX DISTRIBUTION. The following Table gives the estimated number of persons living in Fulham at different ages, assuming the age constitution of the district to be the same as in 1891, no particulars of age having been required to be given at the Census of 1896: — Under 5 17,664 5 to 15 28,187 15 „ 25 21 ,547 25 „ 35 22 ,549 35 „ 45 15,910 45 „ 55 9,772 55 „ 6 5 5,637 65 „ 75 3, 007 Over 75 1,002 125,275 Assuming the proportion of males to females to be the same as in 1896, there are 59,180 males and 66,095 females. AREA OF THE DISTRICT AND DENSITY OF THE POPULATION. The area of Fulham is 1,701 acres, and there are 73.6 persons to the acre compared with 60.3 persons to the acre in the County of London. The following table shows the increase in population of the district during the last 37 years. Population. No. of Houses. Year.

The marriage rate, i.e., persons married per 1,000 inhabitants, was 17.5, the rate for the County of London being 18.6, and that for England and Wales 16.2. BIRTHS AND BIRTH RATE. The births registered during the year numbered 4,307, 2,191 males, and 2,116 females. There was one birth to every 29 inhabitants, and 100 births of males to 96.6 of females. These births correspond to a birth-rate of 34.4, showing a slight recovery on that of 1897, which was 34.2, but being with that exception the lowest yet recorded in Fulham. The rate for the County of London was 29.5, being the lowest yet recorded, and those of the adjoining parishes were Kensington it's, Hammersmith 28.3, Chelsea 24.2. In the other sanitary districts of the Metropolis the rates ranged from 14.4 in St. Martinin-the-Field, 16.2 in the City, and 17.5 in St. George, Hanover Square, to 38.3 in Mile End, 38.9 in Whitechapel, 43.3 in St. George-in-the-East, and 45.2 in St. Luke. Of the 33 large towns in England the highest rates were those of Gateshead 35.5, Sunderland 35.4 and Salford 34.7, and the lowest those of Bradford 24.0, Halifax 22.9 and Huddersfield 22.4. The following Table gives the number of births registered in Fulham, together with the birth-rate during the previous 12 years. Birth-Rate. Males. Females. Total. 1886 1285 2680 1395 39.4 2870 1887 1412 1458 39.3 1883 1406 2983 38.2 1 577 3089 1889 1522 1567 37.2 1890 1551 1593 3144 35.7 1891 1814 1733 3547 37.4 1892 1835 1761 359 6 35.4 1893 186O 1851 371 1 35.4 1894 1937 1826 3763 34.9 1895 1993 1937 3930 35.3 1976 4068 1896 2092 34.8 1897 4106 34.2 2127 1979 1898 2191 2116 4307 34.4 EXCESS OF BIRTHS OVER DEATHS. The natural increase of the population by excess of births over deaths was 2,139, compared with 1,735, 2,025 and 2,076 in the three preceding years. ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN. The births of illegitimate children numbered 171, 91 males and 80 females, forming 4 .0 of the total births. STILL-BORN CHILDREN. 205 still-born children were buried in Fulham Cemetery, being in the proportion of one still-born child to every 21 births. DEATH AND DEATH RATE. The deaths of 2,416 persons—l,183 males and 1,233 females — were registered in Fulham during the year, but of these 475 —242 males and 233 females—were of persons not resident in the district, who died in institutions situated within the parish, while the deaths of 207 persons, 121 males and 86 females, occurred in institutions situated outside the parish. There were, therefore, 2,148 deaths of parishioners of Fulham, the mortality being at the rate of 17.1 per 1,000 living, being slightly in excess of that of last year, which was 16.9, but with that exception lower than that of any previous year. The rate in the male sex was 17.6 and in the female, 16.4. The death-rate of the County of London was 18.3, and of the three adjoining parishes, that of Kensington was 16.4, of Hammersmith 18.3, and of Chelsea 18.2. The lowest death-rates in the 43 sanitary districts into which the Metropolis is divided were 11.7 in Hampstead, 13.2 in St. George, Hanover Square, 13.7 in Stoke Newington, and 14.4 in Wandsworth, and the highest 24.4 in St. George, Southwark, 24.8 in St. George-in-the-East, 24.9 in Holborn, and 25.7 in St. Luke. Of the 33 large towns in England and Wales, the lowest rates were those of Croydon 13.9, Cardiff 14.8, West Ham 15.4, and Huddersfield 15.9, and the highest those of Manchester 21.9, Sunderland 22.6, Salford 22.7 and Liverpool 24.0. CORRECTION FOR AGE AND SEX DISTRIBUTION. In comparing the death-rates of different areas, it is necessary to take into consideration the age and sex distribution of the several populations, and to correct the recorded crude death-rates by the proper factor. Corrected in this way the death-rates of Fulham, the adjoining parishes and London, were:— Crude Death Rate. Corrected Death Rate. Fulham 17.1 17.9 Kensington 16.4 17.5 Hammersmith 18.3 19.4 Chelsea 18.2 19.4 County of London 18.3 19.5 The following Table gives the death-rates of Fulham and of London, uncorrected for age and sex distribution, during the previous 12 years:— Fulham Death-rate per 1,000. London Death-rate per 1,000. 1886 19.0 20.5 1887 19.5 20.3 1888 19.1 1 9.3 18.8 18.4 1889 1890 21.7 21.4 1891 19.7 21.0 1892 20.0 20.3 1893 19.5 21.0 1894 17.9 17.4 1895 19.9 1 9.5 1896 17.5 18.2 1897 16.9 1 7.7 1898 17.1 18.3 The mean rates for the 12 years, 1886 to 1897, being Fulham, 19.1 ; London, 19 .6. The difference between the rate for 1898, and the mean for the previous 12 years in Fulham, represents a saving of 250 lives. SEASONAL DEATH RATE. The mortality in the four quarters of the year was as under: — No of Deaths. Death Rate.

Of the 2,148 deaths registered 722 or 33.6 per cent, were those of infants under the age of one year and the rate of infant mortality measured by the proportion of deaths under one year to births registered was equal to 167 per 1,000 as compared with an average of 170 in the five preceding years. The corresponding rate for the County of London was 166 per 1,ooo, the fates in the various Sanitary Districts ranging from 108 in Stoke Newington, 120 in St. George, Hanover Square, and 128 in the City of London, to 208 in Limehouse, 211 in St. Saviour's, and 221 in Holborn. In the 33 large provincial towns, the infantile mortality was 178 per 1,000, ranging from 150 in Croydon, 153 in Huddersfield, and 156 in Portsmouth, to 208 in Gateshead, 212 in Salford, and 225 in Preston. DEATHS OF ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN. 65 of the children who died before attaining the age of 1 year were illegitimate, the mortality among them being in the proportion of 380 deaths to 1,000 births, or more than twice as heavy as that of children born in wedlock. The following Table gives the infantile mortality in Fulham, London and the adjoining parishes for the past six years. Deaths under one year per 1,000 births. 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898.

These deaths were equal to an annual rate of 582 per 1,000 of the population estimated to be living at that age, the corresponding rate for the Metropolis being 63.8 During the previous 5 years the average death-rate of children under 5 years of age has been in Fulham 62.9, and in London 64.8. insurance of infants. Certificates under the Friendly Societies Acts were issued in respect of 542 children under 5 years of age, and 69 in respect of those between 5 and 10, 56 per cent, of the children dying at these ages being insured. MORTALITY AT SCHOOL AGE. At the age of 5 to 15 years, which is approximately the school period of life, there were 105 deaths, being equal to an annual rate of 37 per 1,000 of those estimated to be living at that age. MORTALITY AT ADOLESCENCE. Between the ages of 15 and 25 years, 59 deaths were recorded, the rate of mortality being 27 per 1,000. MORTALITY AT MATURITY. Between the ages of 25 and 65 years there were 670 deaths, corresponding to a death-rate of 12.5. MORTALITY AT DECLINE. At the age of 65 years and upwards, 286 persons died, the death-rate at this age period being 71.1. DISTRIBUTION OF DEATHS.

DEATHS AND DEATH-RATES FROM ZYMOTIC DISEASES. 396 deaths were due to the seven principal Zymotic diseases, viz.:— Smallpox — Measles 59 Scarlet Fever 35 Diphtheria 61 Whooping Cough 41 Enteric and Continued Fever 18 Diarrhœa 182 396 These 396 deaths a r e equal to a death-rate of 3.16, while the corresponding rate of the County of London was 2.77; of the three adjoining parishes, that of Hammersmith was 3.19, that of Kensington 2.02, and that of Chelsea 2.73. In the various sanitary areas of the Metropolis, the Zymotic death-rate ranged from 1.17 in the City of London, 1.29 in St. George's, Hanover Square, 1.40 in Hampstead and 1.97 in Lee, to 4.04 in St. Luke, 4.13 in Woolwich and 4.26 in Limehouse. In the 33 large towns the Zymotic death-rate averaged 2.85, ranging from 1.65 in Huddersfield, 1.99 in Croydon, and 2.04 in Burnley, to 3.69 in Sunderland, 3.82 in Sheffield, and 4.03 in Salford. During the past 10 years the number of deaths and the death-rate from these diseases have been as under:— Deaths.

No case of Smallpox occurred in Fulham during the year, though one person was reported as suffering from the disease, but it was ascertained that an erroneous diagnosis had been made. SCARLET FEVER. Although there was a marked decline last year in this disease in London, 16,917 cases being notified, compared with 22,850 in 1897, this was not the case in Fulham, as 811 cases were notified against 759 in the preceding year, and the disease was proportionally more prevalent than in any district in London. The following table gives the number of cases notified per 1,000 of the population in Fulham, the three adjoining Parishes and London in 1898 and the eight previous years:— Average for Eight Years. 1890-97 1898 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1 8 9 6 1897 Fulham 5.5 1.3 6.3 6.5 4.9 3.4 6.8 3.0 5.4 4.6 2.3 4.4 Kensington 1. 9 4.3 5.6 6.0 2.8 2.3 3.1 3.7 Hammersmith 3.6 2.3 4.6 6.7 3.2 3.6 5.1 3.7 4.1 4.3 3.1 Chelsea Home District 3.3 5.0 2.0 6.6 6.5 5.7 4.1 4.5 3.5 London 5.1 6.4 4.3 5.8 3.7 2.7 8.6 4.5 5.1 3.8 The distribution of the cases in the several Wards of the parish was as under:— Cases per 1,000 of the population.

Of the 640 removed to hospital, 29 or 4.5 per cent., and of the 171 treated at home, 6 or 3.5 per cent. died. Return Cases.—In 14 instances the disease occurred within 10 days of the return of a child living in the same house from one of the Metropolitan Asylum Board's Hospitals, after recovery from a similar attack. The Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, in October, retained the services of Dr. Simpson, late Medical Officer of Health for Calcutta, to investigate all the " return " cases that have occurred in London for a period of six months, and he will shortly present a report to them on the question. Failure to Notify.—Proceedings were taken by the Vestry against a Medical Practitioner for failing to notify a case of Scarlet Fever, and he was fined £2 and 2s. costs. DIPHTHERIA. There was again an increase in the prevalence of this disease in Fulham, 465 cases of Diphtheria and 11 of Membranous Croup, which is identical with Laryngeal Diphtheria, being notified; the case rate being 3.8 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 3.2 in 1897. The distribution of the cases was as under:— No. of cases. Cases per 1000 of the population. Deaths. Barons Court Ward 2.6 33 2 Hurlingham 26 4.4 4 Lillie 3.6 77 10 Margravine 8 4 4.1 9 Munster 68 16 4.0 Sands End 81 4.3 5 7 Town 35 3.4 Walham 8 70 2 4.4 Workhouse 476 3.8 61 Mortality.—Although the number of cases notified was the highest recorded the fatality was lower than in any year since - - 1892, there being 61 deaths from the disease, giving a case mortality of 12.8 per cent. as compared with 26.1 per cent. in 1893, 31.6 per cent. in 1894, 20.0 per cent. in 1895, 22.0 per cent, in 1896, and 16.3 per cent, in 1897. Of the 386 patients removed to hospital 45 or 11.7 per cent. died, and of the 90 treated at home 16 or 17.7 per cent. died. The following Table shows the fatality at different age periods, of the cases treated at home and of those removed to hospital:— Cases removed to Hospital. Cases treated at home. Age. No. of Cases Mortality per cent. No. of Cases Mortality per cent. Deaths. Deaths. 8 2 0—1 25.0 2 80 .0 1—2 20 5 25.0 5 4 2—3 24 2 8.3 2 6 2 100.0 16.7 3-4 32 7 21.9 1 16.6 4—5 54 9 5 2 40.0 6 5— 10 154 17 11.1 2 9 8 20.7 10 —15 57 3 5.3 15— 2 5 18 9 16 25—35 13 - 35-45 5 4 45—55 1 4 1 25.0 Total 386 45 11.7 90 16 17.7 It will be noticed that there was a larger proportion of adults in whom the disease is much less fatal than in children, among those treated at home than among those removed to hospital, and the difference in the fatality of the disease in children under 10 treated in hospital and those treated at home is very marked, the case mortality among the former being only 14.4 per cent. as compared with 30.6 per cent. among the latter. Judging by the results obtained in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board in cases that are treated with antitoxie serum within 48 hours of the onset of the disease, the fatality of the disease would be further reduced if cases were removed more promptly. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - DIPHTHERIA AND PRIMARY SCHOOLS.

Between May 23rd and May 26th there were four cases among children attending classroom E in the Infants' Department of St. Dunstan's School and the room was in consequence closed on May 27th, until June 13th and on May 30th two cases having occurred in classroom F in the same Department, that room was also closed until the same day. There were subsequently five other cases among children who had been attending the affected classrooms but none among the children in the rest of the School. Between June 18th and 20th three cases of Diphtheria were reported in classroom D, in the Infant's Department of William Street Board School, and on bacteriological examination it was also ascertained that another child must have been attending that class while suffering from a mild attack of the disease. The room was at once closed at the request of the Vestry for a fortnight and though two other children belonging to the same class were subsequently affected, there were no other cases in the rest of the School. On October 10th and 11th four children attending classroom E of the Infants' Department of Ackmar Road Board School were notified as suffering from Diphtheria, and the room was closed until October 26th. Four other children who had been attending the class were subsequently notified, but with the exception of four secondary cases occurring in the families of the affected children in classroom E, there were no other cases in the School until October 30th. It was subsequently ascertained that a child had been attending classroom E between October 1st and October 10th, who from the results of a bacteriological examination had undoubtedly been suffering at the time from a mild attack of Diphtheria. COMPARATIVE PREVALENCE OF DIPHTHERIA IN FULHAM. In London there was a decided diminution of cases of Diphtheria, 11,561 cases being notified as compared with 13,192 in 1897. The Disease showed the highest proportional prevalence in Hackney, Clerkenwell, Holborn, St. Lukes, St. Saviour, St. Georgethe-Martyr and Battersea, in which districts the case rates were higher than in Fulham. The comparative prevalence and fatality of Diphtheria, during recent years, in Fulham, the adjoining parishes and London will be seen from the two following Tables which give the rates of incidence and fatality of the disease in the several localities:— Cases notified per 1,000 Inhabitants.

The arrangements made by the Vestry last year with the Jenner Institute of Preventive Medicine for the bacteriological examination of suspected cases of Diphtheria have been continued, and during the year 102 cases were examined, in 71 of which the bacillus diphtherias was isolated. ENTERIC FEVER. 71 cases were notified, or 5.3 per 10,000 inhabitants, the mean for the preceding nine years being 4.5 per 10,000. B In London and the adjoining parishes the cases notified were as under:— Cases notified per 10,000 inhabitants. County of London 6.7 Kensington 4.2 Hammersmith 5.7 Chelsea 5.7 Mortality.—The disease was the cause of 17 deaths, giving a case mortality of 24.0 per cent., the average for the past five years being 19.8. The death rate from Typhoid Fever in Fulham, London, and the adjoining parishes, was:— Fulham 0.14 County of London 0.12 Kensington 0.08 Hammermith 0.11 Chelsea 0.15 In 15 cases the disease was contracted outside the district. CONTINUED FEVER. One case was notified as Continued Fever, and one death was ascribed to " Febricula." PUERPERAL FEVER. Eight cases were notified, of which four proved fatal, being in the proportion of 0.93 deaths to 1,000 births. Each of the eight cases was attended by a different practitioner and nurse. ERYSIPELAS. 121 persons were certified to be suffering from this disease which was the assigned cause of six deaths. DEATHS FROM NON-NOTIFIABLE ZYMOTIC DISEASES. MEASLES. The epidemic of Measles, which commenced in November, 1897, continued during the first quarter of the year, causing in that period 46 deaths, but during the rest of the year the district was comparatively free from the disease, 9 deaths being recorded in the 2nd quarter, 3 in the 3rd, and 1 in the 4th. The death rate from the disease in Fulham and the adjoining districts was:— Fulham 0.47. 0.68. County of London Kensington 0.70. Hammersmith 1.20. 0.95. Chelsea The distribution of the deaths was as follows: — Baron's Court Ward 9 Hurlingham 1 Lillie 6 Margravine 14 Munster 6 Sands End 9 Town 5 Walham 9 No steps have jet been taken by the London County Council with respect to the application to Measles of the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, which render a person liable to a penalty who, while suffering from any dangerous infectious disease, wilfully exposes himself without proper precautions against spreading the disease, or being in charge of any person so suffering so exposes such sufferer. It will be remembered that the Vestry requested the Local Government Board to sanction the application of this section to Measles, in addition to the other diseases specified in the Act, who suggested that the Vestry should bring the matter under the attention of the County Council, as the question of extending certain of the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act to diseases other than those specified in Section 58 of the Act was one which would be more satisfactorily considered with regard to the Metropolis as a whole than with regard to individual sanitary districts. WHOOPING COUGH. Forty-one deaths were ascribed to this disease, being 27 below the decennial average, allowing for the increase of the population. The death-rate was 0.33 and that of the County of London 0.48. B 2 DIARRHŒA. The deaths ascribed to Diarrhœa numbered 182, the mortality being higher than in any recent year, as was also the case in the County of London. All but 8 of the deaths were of children under 5 years of age, the great majority of these, viz., 150, being infants under 1 year. In addition to these, the majority of the deaths of infants, 65 in number, ascribed to Gastro Enteritis or Gastro Enteric Catarrh, were of the same nature, and it is certainly advisable that all these deaths should be entered under the head of Diarrhœa for comparative purposes; for, as it is, owing to the want of uniformity in classification, the statistics of deaths from Diarrhœa and consequently the zymotic death-rate in different localities are misleading, and useless for comparison. In Fulham Diarrhœa caused a mortality equal to a rate of 1 .45 per 1,000, which was higher than that of any of the London Sanitary Districts excepting Newington, St. Luke, Limehouse, Shoreditch and St. George, Southwark. In the 33 Great English Towns the mortality was equal to a rate of 1.22 per 1,000, varying from 0.49 in Swansea, 0.64 in Halifax and 0.76 in Oldham to 1.89 in Sheffield, 1.95 in Wolverhampton, 2.05 in Preston and 2.16 in Salford. The following table gives the Diarrhœal death-rate of Fulham, London, and the adjoining Parishes during the last 12 years:— 1885- 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1.45 1.05 0.94 1.30 0.53 1.18 Fulham 1.15 1.21 Kensington 0.33 0.68 0.51 0.60 0.70 0.64 0.41 0.35 1.05 0.46 0.79 0.80 Hammersmith 0.79 0.70 1.20 1.12 0.77 0.34 Chelsea 0.76 0.82 0.77 0.77 0.67 1.03 London 0.59 0.80 0.82 0.97 0.60 0.41 0.71 0.92 INFLUENZA. Twenty-four deaths were directly attributed to Influenza as compared with 23, 13, 66, 13 and 19 in the five preceding years. ZOOGENOUS DISEASES. One death was ascribed to Glanders; that of a man who had been employed in some stables in Bagley's Lane, where a pony had been destroyed on account of that disease. VENEREAL DISEASES. These were the cause of 12 deaths, 8 being due to Congenital Syphilis. CLASS III.—DIETETIC DISEASES. Six deaths were certified to be directly due to alcoholic excess, and in 12 cases the disease to which death was attributed was stated to have been accelerated by intemperance, though these represent a very small proportion of the actual number. CLASS IV.—CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. The deaths from diseases in this group numbered 376, being 17.7 per cent, of the total number. DEATHS FROM TUBERCULAR DISEASES. Of these 183 were due to Phthisis and 72 to other tubercular diseases, such as Tubercular Meningitis, Tabes Mesenterica, and General Tuberculosis, these diseases accounting for 11.9 per cent. of the deaths from all causes, and it is probable that many of the deaths ascribed to Marasmus, Debility, Convulsions, etc., were tubercular in nature. In the several Wards of the Parish the deaths from Phthisis were as follows:— Deaths from Phthisis. Deaths per 1,000 living. Barons Court Ward 16 1.3 1 Hurlingham 8 1.36 Lillie 3 2 1.52 Margravine 1.30 27 Munster 26 1.47 Sands End 26 1.37 Town 15 1.50 Walham 1.80 .. 30 3 Not Specified The following Table gives the Phthisis death-rates of Fulham and the adjoining parishes of London for the past six years:— 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 Fulham 1.51 1.42 1.40 1.66 1.53 1.47 Kensington 1.49 1.26 1.57 1.53 1.42 144 1.48 Hammersmith 1.56 1.51 1.56 1.39 1.80 1.40 Chelsea 1. 75 1.64 1.82 1.74 1.92 London 1.68 1.90 1.72 1.77 1.71 1.72 In the report for 1897 an abstract was given of the report of the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis, and during the past year the question of the prevention of Tuberculosis has attracted much attention, and with the view of educating the public and arousing their interest the National Association for the Prevention of Consumption and other forms of Tuberculosis has been formed. The importance of the question cannot be over-estimated, as although the mortality from Phthisis has enormously decreased during the past 60 years, having fallen from 3,800 per million of the population in 1838 to 1,300 per million, or one-third of its former mortality, in 1897, there are still some 60,000 deaths annually in England and Wales due to Phthisis and other forms of Tuberculosis. The great decline in the fatality of the disease has been coincident with the great sanitary improvements of the last half-century, and it is to these, together with the higher standard of living among the working classes, better and more abundant food, and the improved dwellings, that the steady diminution of the disease is due. There is, therefore, evenreason to hope that this will continue, even without any special measures of repression, provided that Sanitary Authorities will enforce the sanitary laws as far as possible, with the view of securing healthy houses and workshops, the prevention of overcrowding, the prompt removal of all refuse, the elimination of smoke and noxious vapour from the atmosphere, and the freedom of milk and other food from the germs of Tuberculosis, though to ensure the latter there is urgent need of fresh legislation. Beyond this much can be done by the education of the public to a knowledge of the danger that arises from the dissemination of Tuberculous products by phthisical patients, and the Vestry have now made arrangements for the disinfection of rooms which have been occupied by those suffering from the disease, but to effectively bring home the fact that Phthisis is an infectious disease some modified system of notification is required. With regard to the cure of the disease, having regard to the fact that the chances of the recovery of those who are admitted to our infirmaries are almost hopeless, and that they are a source of danger to others, Local Authorities should, failing action by the Guardians in that direction, consider the question of providing sanatoria for the treatment of phthisical patients; as Section 75 of the Public Health (London) Act of 1891 gives them power to provide hospitals for the inhabitants of' their districts, or to combine with other authorities in providing a common hospital. CANCER. Malignant cancerous diseases caused 98 deaths, 75 being of persons over 45 years of age. OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. Of other diseases of this class Rheumatic Fever was the cause of 7 deaths, and Diabetes of 7. CLASS V.—DEVELOPMENTAL DISEASES. From diseases of this class 175 deaths were registered, 108 being due to premature birth, atelectasis, or non-inflation of the lungs and congenital deformities, and 67 deaths were ascribed to " old age." CLASS VI.—LOCAL DISEASES. The diseases of this group were responsible for 925 deaths, or 43 per cent. of the total number, the following being the principal classes: — I. —DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. From these there were 204 deaths, 78 being from Apoplexy, 26 from Insanity and General Paralysis of the Insane, and 40 from Convulsions. 2. —DISEASES OF THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS. 114 deaths were ascribed to diseases of the circulatory system. 3.—DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM. From these diseases, Phthisis being excluded, there were 383 deaths, or 17.8 per cent, of the deaths from all causes, being 49 below the average of the last five years, allowing for the increase of the population. Of these 194 were ascribed to Bronchitis and 165 to Pneumonia. 4. —DISEASES OF THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. Nine deaths were registered in this class, three being due to diseases of parturition. The total number of deaths recorded as occurring within 21 days of childbirth was 12, the causes assigned being— Septic Diseases 4 Scarlet Fever 1 Puerperal Convulsions 1 Other Accidents of Childbirth 2 Heart Disease 2 Other Diseases 2 or 1 death to every 358 births. From the other classes of Local Diseases there were 217 deaths, viz.:— Diseases of Digestive System 157 „ Urinary „ 43 „ Lymphatic „ 2 „ Integumentary „ 5 „ Bones and Joints 5 „ Organs of Special Sense 5 CLASS VII. Different forms of violence caused 85 deaths. ACCIDENT OR NEGLIGENCE. Run over 11 Falls 16 Burns 9 Poison 2 Drowning 1 Suffocation of infants in bed 23 „ by food 1 Otherwise 14 — 77 SUICIDE. Cut 1 Poison 3 Drowning 2 Hanging 1 — 7 HOMICIDE. Manslaughter 1 — 1 85 CLASS VIII.-ILL-DEFINED AND NOT SPECIFIED CAUSES. Under this heading there were 225 deaths, the majority, viz., 117 being certified as due to Debility, Marasmus or Inanition. CERTIFICATION OF THE CAUSES OF DEATH. Of the 2,148 deaths registered, 1,962, or 9 1.34 per cent., were duly certified by registered medical practitioners, and 183, or 8.54 per cent. by the Coroner after inquest, while the causes of 3, or 0.14 per cent., were uncertified. INQUESTS. Of the 183 inquests held on parishioners, 151 were held in the parish, and 32 at institutions outside. The subjects were, males 95, females 67; and their ages— Under 5 88 5 to 65 81 Over 65 14 183 Those due to natural causes may be classified as follows: — Zymotic Diseases 17 Respiratory „ 19 Tubercular „ 5 Circulatory „ 15 Convulsions and other Diseases of the Nervous System 21 Other Diseases 20 97 The deaths due to accident or negligence have been already classified. DEATHS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. FULHAM UNION INFIRMARY AND WORKHOUSE. This Institution, situated in Fulham, serves for the two parishes of Fulham and Hammersmith : 525 deaths occurred in the Infirmary and 10 in the Workhouse. Of these 275 were parishioners of Fulham and 260 belonged to Hammersmith and other parishes. Their ages and causes of death will be found in Table A. WESTERN FEVER HOSPITAL. 253 deaths occurred in the Western Fever Hospital, Seagrave Road. Of these 64 belonged to Fulham, and 189 to other Metropolitan Districts. DEATHS OCCURRING OUTSIDE THE DISTRICTS AMONG PERSONS BELONGING THERETO. The deaths of parishioners in public institutions and elsewhere outside the parish numbered 207, and occurred in the following places:- St. George's Hospital West London „ St. Mary's „ St. Bartholomew's „ King's Cross „ St. Thomas „ Middlesex „ London „ Westminster „ Jubilee „ German „ Great Northern Central Hospital Consumption Hospital, Brompton Cancer Hospital Victoria Hospital for Children Evelina „ „ Belgrave „ „ Children's Hospital, Paddington Lock Hospital National „ Hospital for Women, Chelsea Royal Hospital for Incurables Banstead Asylum Bethlem „ Cane Hill „ Number of Deaths of Parishioners of Fulham. 48 28 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 4 1 1 12 4 18 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 11 2 4 Caterham Asylum 5 Colney Hatch „ 8 Friern Barnet „ 1 Hanwell „ 6 Ilford „ 2 Leavesden „ 1 Middlesex County Asylum 1 South-Western Fever Hospital 7 Fountain „ „ 3 North-Western „ „ 7 Lambeth Infirmary 1 St. George's-in-the-East Infirmary 1 St. Pancras Infirmary 1 Licensed Victuallers' Asylum 1 St. Luke's House, Osnaburgh Street 1 St. Ann's House, Stoke Newington 1 Elsewhere 11 207 Of the 2,148 deaths registered during the year 535 or 24.9 percent. took place in public institutions. The percentages in the several classes of institutions in Fulham and London were as follows:— Fulham. London. Deaths occurring in Workhouses and Work- house Infirmary 13.0 14.7 Deaths occurring in Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals 3.8 2.1 Deaths occurring in other Hospitals 6.2 10.1 Deaths occurring in Public Lunatic and Imbecile Asylums 1.9 2.1 24.9 29.3 PUBLIC MORTUARY. 176 bodies were removed to the Mortuary during the year and were admitted as follows: — At the request of the Coroner 147 Brought in by the Police 2 5 At the request of the Medical Officer of Health 4 176 Inquests were held on 172, and post-mortem examinations were made in 74 of the above cases. VACCINATION. The following Tables, furnished by Mr. Collins, the Vaccination Officer, give the vaccination returns for 1897, and for the first six months of 1898, those for the last six months not being yet complete:— SUPPLEMENTAL RETURN FOR 1897, FOR THE PARISH OF FULHAM. Successfully Vaccinated. Insusceptible of Vaccination. Had Small Pox. Dead. Postponed by Medical Certificate. Removed. Outstanding. No. of Births Registered from Ist Jan , 1897, to 31st Dec., 1897. Certificates Granted under Clause 2 or the Vaccination Act of 1898. 3341 22 - 432 4 2 2 51 15 4107 4 RETURN OF VACCINATION FOR THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY TO JUNE 1898, FOR THE PARISH OF FULHAM. No. of Births Registered from 1st Jan., 1897, to 31st Dec., 1897. Successfully Vaccinated. Insusceptible of Vaccination. Had Small Pox. Dead. Postponed by Medical Certificate. Removed. Outstanding. Certificates Granted under Clause 2 of the Vaccination Act of 1898. 157 8 9 - 189 96 184 64 2146 26 The return for 1897 is the most satisfactory that has been issued for some years, only 6-5 per cent, of the children remaining unaccounted for, as compared 10 per cent., 8 per cent., 7.4 per cent, and 9.2 per cent, in ths preceding years. The number of persons who have availed themselves of the "Conscientious Objection " clause of the recent Vaccination Act is fortunately not great. DISINFECTION. Infected articles were disinfected by the contractor, Mr. Lacy, St. John's Wharf, by whom they were also collected. The weight of the articles disinfected was 1794 cwt., and the amount paid by the Vestry to Mr. Lacy was £1075 9s. 4d. During the past six years the Vestry have paid for disinfecting infected articles an average of £870 a year. Tenders have been now accepted for the erection of a disinfecting station, and for the necessary plant. SHELTER. A shelter containing four rooms with bathroom and lavatory is now being erected by Messrs. Humphreys, at the Townmead Wharf, for the use of persons during the period necessary for the disinfection of their rooms. HOUSE REFUSE. The weekly service for the removal of house refuse has been fairly satisfactory, and there have been fewer complaints respecting the delay in removal than in former years, but I would again urge upon the Vestry the necessity for a more frequent removal of refuse from flats, at any rate, during the hot weather. DISPOSAL OF THE REFUSE. The Vestry have accepted the tender of the Hornfall Company for the erection of " Destructor " at the Townsmead Wharf, capable of dealing with the whole of the refuse of the Parish, and the work is now being proceeded with. COMBINED DRAINAGE. The existing state of the law as regards the definition of drains and sewers, has continued to involve the Vestry in a very heavy expenditure, as during the year, 75 systems of combined drainage, embracing 185 houses, have been dealt with by the Vestry, who have re-constructed the sewer portion in each case at a cost of upwards of £2,000. It is to be regretted that the Bill drafted by the Conference of Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards to amend the definition clause of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, is no nearer becoming law than it was a year ago. SEWER VENTILATION. The Vestry continues to fix ventilating shafts in suitable positions whenever the consent of the owners of the property can be obtained, and during the year 40 have been erected. The London County Council have also at last placed a shaft in Melmoth Place, and closed the surface ventilator in respect of which the Vestry took proceedings against them in 1896. NUISANCE FROM MANURE. Mention was made last year of the difficulty experienced in the summer in securing the regular clearance of manure from stables in the parish. During the past year the Company who were the chief offenders, undertook the removal themselves instead of trusting as before to a Contractor, with the result that there were very few complaints respecting the accumulation of the manure but there were many with regard to the time of the removal of the offensive peat moss litter and these seem to have been general throughout London as enquiries were made by the County Council as to whether it was desirable that peat moss litter should be included within the provisions of the bye-law made under section 16 of the Public Health (London) Act, "prescribing the hours of removal of offensive matter throughout London and the construction of the carriage conveying such matter." The Vestry informed the Council that they were strongly of opinion that peat moss litter should be included within the provisions of the bye-law and they also requested the Council to consider the advisability of making an alteration in the hours prescribed, viz., that the hours for removing offensive refuse shall be from 10 30 in the evening to 8 in the morning for both winter and summer instead of as now from 4 a.m. to 10 a.m. between March and October and from 6 a.m. to 12 noon between November and February. SMOKE NUISANCES. During May and June there were many complaints respecting the nuisance caused by the emission of dense volumes of black smoke from chimney shafts at various manufactories in the District, the cause being invariably attributed to the difficulty experienced in obtaining smokeless coal owing to the strike in South Wales. The Vestry though recognising the difficulty in which the owners were placed, were of opinion that the nuisance might be minimised by the exercise of special precautions, and the owners were accordingly informed that they must take steps to put a stop to what was a very serious inconvenience, and that in the event of the nuisance continuing proceedings would be taken against them. After this warning there was a noticable diminution in the nuisance and it was not found necessary to prosecute. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. The Vestry, as recommended in the report for 1897, have recently appointed a special Sanitary Inspector for the purpose of enforcing the bye-laws made under Section 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, in respect of houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family, and up to the present time 180 houses have been registered. CERTIFICATES UNDER CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACTS, 1890 & 1891. Certificates for exemption from Inhabited House Duty were granted in respect of 11 houses and refused in respect of 125. SUPERVISION OF NEW PROPERTY. The advisability of granting certificates in respect of new houses which has been dealt with in previous reports was again brought before the Vestry, and the question was referred to a Sub-Committee for full consideration and report. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. The following samples were taken for analysis during the year:— No. of samples. No. adulterated. Milk 16 123 Butter 6 4 11 Coffee 7 Lard 1 Flour 7 Pepper 6 Mustard 2 Sugar 2 Sweets 2 Tapioca 2 Sago 1 Salt 15 Margarine 5 Whisky 10 1 Gin 4 28 251 11.1 per cent. of the samples examined were adulterated, against 12.6 per cent. in 1896 and 7.6 per cent. in 1897. One sample was obtained for every 498 of the population as compared with one for every 410 persons in London in 1897. In July Mr. E. G. Clayton resigned his position as Public Analyst, and Mr. H. Cecil Cribb, B.Sc. Lond., F.1.C., was appointed in his place. Arrangements have now been made to submit 350 samples a year for analysis. Prosecutions were instituted by the Vestry in the following cases:— Defendant. Offence. Result. W. Hellyer, 117, Estcourt road Selling margarine without properly marked wrapper.

In 20 other cases in which proceedings had been instituted the summonses were withdrawn by the Vestry on payment of costs by the defendants, the works necessary to abate the nuisances having been executed. The fines and costs imposed amounted to £ 72 is. The Vestry appealed against the decision of the Justices in the case against Serf, the owner of 36, Star Road, in which they held that there was no evidence that a pipe which took the drainage of four houses was a "drain," although it was laid in accordance with a plan which had been approved by the Surveyor of the late Fulham District Board of Works, and it was proved that the custom of the late Fulham District Board was not to make entries of the approval of plans for combined drainage in their books, but for the Surveyor, upon the approval being given by the Committee, to make a note of the fact upon the application of the builder. The special case stated by the Kensington Justices was argued before the Lord Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Wills, who directed the case to be transmitted to the Justices for the further hearing of the summons, with the opinion of the Court that there was evidence that the pipe in question was a "drain" within the meaning of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and not a sewer. At the further hearing the Justices, after hearing the evidence, still held that the pipe in question was a sewer, although since the first hearing of the case it had been held by Justices Wills and Kennedy, in the case of Geen v. Newington Vestry, that where a drain had been constructed in accordance with a plan initialled by the Surveyor, although there was no entry relating to it in any minute book of the Vestry, there was " abundant evidence " that it had been constructed by order of the Vestry as part of a combined system of drainage within the meaning of Sections 74 and 250 of the Metropolis Management Act, and was consequently a "drain." Since the Justices' decision in this case all summonses ordered by the Vestry have been applied for at the West London Police Court. SANITARY STAFF. The appointment in December of an additional Sanitary Inspector to supervise houses let in lodgings, raises the staff of Inspector to 7, including the Drainage Inspector, and there are now to each Sanitary Inspector 20,879 inhabitants and 2,850 houses, as compared with 18,600 inhabitants and 2,850 houses to each Inspector in the County of London. The Vestry have had also before them the question of appointing a female Sanitary Inspector, but have adjourned the matter for further consideration. An additional Clerk, who was greatly nee led, has also been recently appointed in the Public Health Department. GENERAL SANITARY WORK. 1,015 complaints were received and attended to during the year, and 2,751 "intimation notices" and 845 "statutory notices" were served. It is unnecessary to notice in detail the various improvements effected, but a large amount of beneficial work has been accomplished during the year by the officials of the sanitary staff who have discharged their often difficult duties with energy, intelligence and discretion.
