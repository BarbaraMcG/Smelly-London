ANNUAL REPORT MADE TO THE VESTRY BY THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. FOR THE YEAR ENDING LADY DAY, 1877. Chatrman and Gentlemen, The year now ended, has proved uneventful, considered from a sanitary point of view. ???Ttheless there has been heard the sound of progress. The Prime Minister has publicly ???that the policy which diminished the death rate of a great nation, was a feat as uderable as any of those decisive battles, which generally decided nothing." And the d Chief Huron, followed in the same strain in his address to the Lord Mayor when ???ented to him. He stated that "the time was fast approaching, when he hoped through efforts of the Corporation, and the assistance of the legislature, with that of the ???ropolitan Board of Works, not a single Workman's dwelling would exist within the ???oe once surrounded and encompassed by the walls of the ancient City, would remain rained, unventilated, and unprovided with an ample supply of pure water I would ???add the hope, that not a single Workman's dwelling, not possessing these important ???Marias, will exist outside the space, " once encompassed and surrounded by the ancient ???i Walls." Utterances like these, and coming from men occupying the highest positions in land, mark to what an extent sanitary subjects are now claiming attention. The time not long gone by, when such declarations might have been looked for in vain, and if ???Is would have created wonder and surprise that such small and insignificant subjects ???aid have employed the brains of Statesmen. Besides, Meetings and Conferences have been held during the year, under distinguished ???idents. with reference to sanitary affairs, and at which propositions were made, and ???luaions reached, that must need help on the cause of Public Health. In the coarse ???unun travail we have first thoughts, then words, and afterwards actions—the matured ???dt 10 Parish of Saimt Grege the Mayer, southwark. It is sad to witness how waste-fully our lives are spelt and their shortness still for abridged; and we might feel imagined to murmur at the slow progress we in dying this. But we must remember that perfection, or rather some approvin thereunto, can only br resched throug prolonged labour suffering. With respect to this District, I am glad to say that some marked and benefiicia; ch??? are impending- Buildings which have long tarn a disgrce to our parish, and hence unfit for human habitation, will I hope be replaced by otbm, which will aland Uihl peatlion, and in which health, comfort and cleunliness may ba possible, and to which name of home ran be lovingly given. The Metropolitan Board of Worka. from ??? tion of the representation mada unto thern of areas to be deall with under tha Artiram | Labourers Dwellings Art, 1876, have arrived at tha conclusion that, aa regards tha folk??? "it ia deairable that'achrmee under the said Art should be taken with a view to their confirmed by the Secretary of State." This has been dona. An Offical enquiry was in thia Hall on the Slat of March, by M. 0. Nicwoll*, Eaq., Commissioner appoints I tha Secretary of State, and whose report now awaita the deciaion of the latter. The three Areas ara aituated in what are named the Mint Street, King Street Elirabeth Pince Arena. The Mint Street Area includes the atreet of that name, not??? for the despemte characters it haa harboured, and for its aasociations with etime. rol??? and murder, unequalled probably by any other locality of the same estent in the netroe This Area consists of 64 bouses, and alands upon 46,023 feet of ground One hundrad forty tenements will be prepared by the new scheme, of which 90 will heart aak??? registered ledgers. The buildinga proposed will only cover 23,132 feet, not hals number of the feet at preeent covered. In the King Street Area will be met with some porta of Flint Street, Onn Street Martin Street. These ara in a filthy and repulsive condition, and in a great meet from the bnsinese carried on in them, for which they are totally unfit, namely, th fish curing. By reason of the amallneea of the yards, a great part of the process is as on in the open afreet. There are 58 Noumea including two shops which cover 16,241 Only 11,997 feat will be covered by the new building. Elisabeth Place contains houses moat of which are placed back to lack, cosaque there are neither yards, nor means of through ventilation There are 64 houses, was cover 26,762 feet This number will be reduced lo 11,122 feet. The population living in these three Areas is 1,340 and net???i*a 602 rocms T??? 602 rooms will be replaced by 110 tenements, comprising 160 of one rum. 235 of rooms, and 60 of three rooms The apnea now covered is 91,052 fret; the apace ??? to be covered will only amount to 41,611 foot. There will thus mm a in more cable ??? the oerwpanta, and a logger open space This will be brought about by the prat??? atmetnra of the new buddings, as half of them will be made four statics high, and five stories high. 11 Annual Report of the Mtdical Officer of Healtk—1870—7. The estimated outlay, with widening of the roads and other improvements is £59,760. ???n this will be deducted tho value of the land to be used for building, amounting to ,407, leaving a net coat of £33,653. There was another Area sent in—Union Street Area, but it was considered advisable he Metropolitan Board of Works, to defer meddling with it, and only proceed with the ???rs, lest inconvenience and injury should follow from closing so many dwellings, and ting the inhabitants adrift. With regard to the new street which will connect Long Lane, Great Dover Street, and Newington Causeway with the Southwark Bridge Hood, mention will doubtless be Is in tho report of the Surveyor of Roads, as it more especially belongs to his depart???it, However in ita construction, unhealthy nooks, alleys and oourts must necessarily amoved. There will bo a broad high-way not only upon which traffic may be carried, over which tho wind muy blow. TABLE No. 1.

Grave eomplainta are made in the Report upon the inefficient manner in which vacciion had been performed. Out of 1000 caaea only 49 had been vaccinated in the way in cli tho National Vaccine Board fifty years ago declared to be the best. Hems ia diaed the error made so much of by the op|*onents of vaccination, that more vaccinated «ons than unvarcinated have been attacked with small-pox. Death from small-pox •re vaccination haa boon duly performed is of the rarest occurrence. Out of 1,194 case* ited in the Hospitala, no such death happened. Unvaccinated persons died at the rate ;7 per cent. No cases of small-pox were seen after revaccination. From the 15th Febry, to tho 15th June, 1871, there wero admitted 1,191 cases; and from the experience .<i gained the Reporters aro enabled to state that " overwhelming evidence of the toctive power of vaccination and revaccination was afforded them." No freedom from epidemics of small pox cau be expocted so long as children are wed to encspe vaccination, for such become on abiding source for tho perpetuation spread of the disease. The utmost watchfuluets, energy ami stringency should ho rcised in carrying out vaccination. No fire can exist where there ia no combustiblo fttar.

We have heard denounced, times out of number, and in the strongest terms, the ??? of the holders of small property, as being most selfish, and they themselves the most ??? tent and obstinate opponents of sanitary measures and improvements; and moreover, ??? this class formed a considerable portion of our Vestries. However this may be, they ??? claim a monopoly to the unenviable distinction. Amongst them may be included possessors of broad acres and vast domains. A lordly owner, holding property of a wretched and dilapidated kind, in one of our busy northern towns, not only would tal??? step to improve it, but opposed strongly any steps being taken in that direction.

"V??? was the answer, "but a mistake had been made, for the pigs had bora turned out, w??? the pigs ought to have remained, and the tenants have been turned out." Another occurred, in which the owner held the same high title and position in the land. A nur??? of his tenants and workmen were living in unreined, foul, ruinous houses, altoge??? unfit for human habitation, and quite inferior to the stables and kennels in which Lordship kept hie horses and dogs. Nothing could be done by the Town council,u??? his Lordship would either build upon the land, or sell it; and if the latter, promise no mining operations should be carried on beneath. His Lordship would M make no pro??? except to let the land, stating that the Town Council must take all the risk of dange??? the structures, should mining operations be carried on. The mines, I may add, ??? almost valueless. Yet at this time his Lordship was spending vast sums of money on restoration of a Cathedral. We may hope that upon the historic page of that Cathed??? whilst the munificence of this donor is largely displayed, some small apace may be eel as whereon may bo given the account of the condition in which his tenants were then liv??? We have, in this case, a dead stone Cathedral, passing in interest and care, tha bea hearts and thinking braina of men.

And that houses have not to be dealt with a alone, houses in connexion with their influence on the character and habits of the people who I in them. For as she truly adds, that repairs and all that is deemed necessary to put the in a sanitary condition, may be carried out. yet a few weeks may see them passingvag??? into their neglected and foul condition, from the bad aad careless habits of those ??? occupy them (Octavia Hill). 21 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1876—7. It is in localities like unto these, that diseases ride and gather strength, and from ??? they are disseminated. One human being from unfortunate circumstances, or ???ppy and unwise conduct may set up a disease which shall spread near and far. Ex???as of this fact abound. A characteristic one is given by Carlyle. "One of Dr. ???'s facta strikes us much" he says, "An Irish widow, her husband having died in of the lanes of Edinburgh, went forth with her children bare of all resource, to seek from the Charitable Establishments of the City. She in all cases was refused. Her and strength at last failed her; she sank down in typhus fever, infected her lane it, so that seventeen other persons died from the disease in consequence. And thus proved her sisterhood by her typhus fever killing them." We need hardly call to our ???rabrnnco the Block Assizes, as history calls them, when the wretched, neglected prisoners ???d that treatment by raying out from their filthy ragged persons contagion, which, ???oyed Chief Barons, Baronets, Lord Mayors, Sheriffs, Knights, Serjeants at Law, rtnen, Justices, Juries, and thousands of the Commonality. The fever born and bred ???e persons of the prisoners. spread from town to town producing dismay, disease and ???. This destruction was evokod by sheer neglect and inhumanity. "A man dies of cholera in the Valley of the Ganges, and the disease there generated ??? Europe, Asia and America; a child in Arabia has the small-pox, and the disease of child spreads and exterminates tribes of North American Indiana; the plague born in ???, or Ethiopia, prostrates the population of the Roman Empire, and sweeps away at ???vals through centuries a largo proportion of the population of Athens, Florence, ???on and other large cities." Man must help man or destroy him. The latter has been ???ly the oourse pursued, and with considerable success. The means of safety are placed ???r own hands, and whether we neglect them from ignorance, carelessness, or avarice, ???aaults will be the same. In some countries about which I have read, the paying of taxes is a season of rejoicing festivity ; a fact which seems hardly credible when we consider our own experience of like demands. Yet it is possible to conceive that such rejoicing and festivity might be ???ifested here, did wo feel quite assured they were applied to the ends intended, and that ??? ends were wise and beneficent. Anyhow, we often voluntarily tax ourselves, and to ???rge extent, for ends which are neither wise nor beneficent. To celebrate some passing ???ronce, we raise up the moat tawdry foolish structures out of canvas and plank, which ???eaent nothing either in nature or art, and which vanish almost in the same hour that them rise, and this is done at a cost which would have drained, cleansed, and made ???tiful a city or town, or built alms-houses, or laid out parka and gardens, which would ??? proved useful, and remained as durable memorials of events to future generations this has been done by towns which for years have been discussing and haggling about money which would bo required to wash and make themselves clean and healthy. I ??? not apeak about the thousands upon thousands spent over even still more transitory even less satisfactory objects.
