ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH 1957. Public Health Department, Municipal Offices, New Maiden. June, 1958. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Maiden and Coombe. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1957 which has been prepared in accordance with Ministry of Health Circular 1/58. The health of the community remains good and the vital statistics compare favourably with those of the country as a whole. As a result of preventive health measures and the use of modern drugs the seriousness of many infectious diseases has diminished. Of the notifiable infectious diseases poliomyelitis is now probably the most serious. An important step was taken during the year in the prevention of this disease by the decision of the Ministry of Health to make use of imported Salk vaccine. Parents of children in the priority groups and expectant mothers were asked to register far vaccination. The response was excellent and by the end of the year over 80$ had registered. In conclusion I should like to thank the Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee for their helpful co-operation and the staff of the department for the efficiency with which they have carried out their duties. I am, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient servant, J. B. MORWOOD. Medical Officer of Health. 2. STATISTICAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS.

PREVALENCE AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. Scarlet Fever,. The number of cases of scarlet fever notified during the year was 18, giving an incidence rate of 0o39 per thousand population. All the cases were very mild find were treated at home. Diphtheria For the tenth year in succession the district was completely free from this disease, the last case having been notified in April, 1947. Immunisation against diphtheria progresses smoothly. Special efforts continue to be made to encourage mothers to bring their babies for immunisation in those cases where persuasion by the health visitor has failed. Under the National Health Service Act all medical practitioners providing general medical services in the area are given an opportunity to provide services in the scheme 0 This ha3 resulted in a number of children being immunised otherwise than at schools or clinics. The following statistics refer to immunisation carried out during the year:- Number of children immunised during the year (pre-school 558, school 60) 618 Number of children receiving reinforcing doses 1,419 Although diphtheria is no longer a serious public health problem it must be remembered that the disease is still present and that any relaxation of the immunisation campaign could have serious results. Immunisation not only prevents many children from contracting diphtheria, but greatly mitigates the severity of the illness if a child should fall a victim to this disease. Whooping Cough. The number of eases of whooping cough notified was 64. Six cases were removed to hospital and no deaths occurred. Whooping cough is one of the most serious diseases of childhood and mothers appreciate the facilities for immunisation which are available. It is to be hoped that whooping cough immunisation will prove as effective as immunisation against diphtheria. As whooping cough is most dangerous in the first year of life immunisation should be commenced at the third or fourth month. Details of the number of children immunised against whooping cough during the year are as follows:- 8 Number of children immunised 522 Number of children receiving reinforcing do S6 s 147 Vaccinations. The substantial degree of protection from smallpox which the population had during the time of compulsory vaccination is being slowly reduced duB to the reduction throughout the country in the numbers of children vaccinated at the appropriate times. The percentage of infants under 1 year vaccinated in this Borough during the year was 66.5% and efforts are being made to increase this figure. As with diphtheria immunisation, all medical practitioners providing general medical services in the area are given an opportunity to provide services for carrying out vaccinations. During the year the following were performed:- Vaccinations 429 Revaccinations 66 495 Of the above, 235 individuals were vaccinated or revaccinated by private practitioners. 350 of the persons vaccinated were under one year of age. Acute Poliomyelitis. Five cases of acute poliomyelitis occurred during the year, 3 paralytic 2 non-paralytic. One child aged 7 months died in Prance and the others made a satisfactory recovery. Immunisation against this disease continued throughout the year. The most important event was the decision of the Ministry of Health towards the end of the year to import Salk vaccine. More than 8($ of the priority groups in the Borough had registered for this vaccine by the 31st December, 1957 Typhoid Fever. One case of typhoid fever occurred in an adult who had contracted the disease abroad. He made an uninterrupted recovery. Measles. The number of cases of measles notified (627) was much higher than in 1956. No deaths occurred. Scabies and Verminous Conditions. Necessary action for these conditions has been very limited and calls for no special comment. 9. Dysentery. 31 cases of the mild sonne dysentery occurred, chiefly affecting younger school children. This condition is highly infectious among young children and its incidence has been increasing during the past few years throughout the country. Food Poisoning. There was one outbreak of food poisoning involving 4 persons. The cause of the outbreak was tin, due to the failure of lacquer on the internal surface of a tin of rhubarb. The tin was one of a batch canned two years prior to sale. In addition there were 3 single cases of food poisoning which were due to salmonella typhi-murium 1, salmonella monschaufl- 1 and salmonella enteritidis 1. * Cases removed to Isolation Hospitals.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR 1252 Public Health Department, Municipal Offices, New Maiden. June, 1958. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Maiden and Coombe. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my annual report on the work of the Public Health Inspectors during the year. There were no changes of staff and steady progress was made in the work of the department. As much time as possible was devoted to the inspection of food premises with a view to securing improved standards. The Rent Act, 1957, came into operation during the year and the principal duty of Local Authorities is in connection with the issue of Certificates of Disrepair. To the majority of tenants the procedure under this Act is confusing, but the help of the Citizens' Advice Bureau to both tenants and landlords has done much to facilitate the administration of the Act. I am, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient servant, S. J. T. WOOD. Chief Public Health Inspector. 14. HOUSING. The general standard of housing in the Borough is good. Number of houses built during the year- (a) by the Council 13 (b) by private enterprise 57 Number of houses in course of construction- (a) by the Council 52 (b) by private enterprise 31 For the purpose of abating nuisances or executing repairs to houses the following notices were served - Preliminary 42 Abatement 3 These figures do not include verbal notices often given with regard to minor matters. HOUSING ACT. 1949. - IMPROVEMENT GRANTS. Applications for improvement grants for the conversion and modernisation of older properties are considered by the Council. These grants are made under the provisions of the Housing Act, 1949, as amended by the Housing Repairs and Rent Act, 1954, and the Rent Act, 1957. Many enquiries were made and advice given about the availability of grants and the following table shows the grants approved during the year. Dwellings to be provided by CONVERSION.

(b) Total grant approved. £1,801. £280. The Council approved an application by the Maiden and Coombe Housing Society Ltd. and the Maiden and Coombe Old Peoples Welfare Association for the conversion of a house, 32, Poplar Grove, New Maiden, into 9 flatlets for old people, together with accommodation for a house mother. The work was completed and the premises officially opened in 15. July, 1957. The cost of the improvement works was £3,602, a 50% grant of £1,801 being made. A further grant was made by the Council under the provisions of Section 93 of the Housing Act, 1936, of £1,801. This is the second conversion carried out by this Society providing accommodation for old people. The rentals are fixed so as to cover the estimated annual expenditure without showing a profit and the tenants are enabled to maintain their independence which is so important to old people. RENT ACT. 1957. This Act came into operation on the 6th July, 1957, and among other matters made provision for a permitted increase of rents of houses with rateable values of £40 or less in the Metropolitan Police District. A local authority's responsibility under this act is to deal with applications from tenants for certificates of disrepair. Applications for Certificates of Disrepair.

The whole of the area is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and the supply has been satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. In view of the large number of routine bacteriological and chemical examinations carried out by the Water Examination Department of the Board it was not considered necessary to make any routine tests. One water sample was taken on receipt of a complaint, the report on which was satisfactory. All dwelling houses in the area are supplied by public water mains direct to the houses. 16. DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION. The following numbers of rooms were disinfected for the undermentioned causes:- Measles 1 Tuberculosis 5 Foliomyelitis or suspected poliomyelitis 13 Other 2 Fourteen bags of clothing were disinfected.

Tuberculin tested 10 Pasteurised 10 Sterilised 11 The difference between a dealer's and a supplementary licence is that, if a dairyman has premises in a local government area where he retails milk he is issued with a dealer's licence. Should he retail milk in another area he must obtain a supplementary licence from the Council of that area. DETAILS OP MILK TESTING. Class of Milk Number of Samples Tested Appropriate Tests Number of Samples Passed Failed Pasteurised 75 Phosphatase 75 - Methylene blue 75 - Sterilised 5 Turbidity 5 - Tuberculin tested (Pasteurised) 38 Phosphatase 42 - Methylene blue 42 - Tuberculin tested (Farm Bottled) 6 Methylene blue 5 1 Biological 4 - The purpose of the phosphatase and methylene blue tests is to determine respectively whether or not the milk has been adequately heat treated and whether it is of good keeping quality. The turbidity test for sterilised milk is to determine whether or not the milk has been adequately sterilised. The greater importance must be attached to the phosphatase test as correct heat treatment or pasteurisation reasonably ensures that all pathogenic organisms have been eliminated. Farm bottled (tuberculin tested) milk is not pasteurised and is retailed without treatment. 20. It is pleasing to record that only one milk sample taken during the year failed to pass an appropriate test. Further samples were taken which proved satisfactory. FOOD. There are no slaughter houses or knackers' yards in the Borough. The following table lists the food premises in the district by type of business.

On investigation the substances were found to be a piece of stale dough, a piece of thread, a piece of peel head (the long handled wooden implement used for inserting the bread in the ovens), bird excreta on a loaf and mould growth in a wrapped sliced loaf. In each case after careful consideration of the facts the Council sent a letter to the manufacturer indicating that a serious view would be taken of any further complaints. 2. Crumpets. A complaint was received of mould growth in a packet of crumpets. After careful consideration of the facts letters of warning were sent to the manufacturer and retailer. 3. Milk. A complaint was received that foreign matter in a cup of tea had come out of a bottle of milk. The foreign matter looked like a piece of toffee which on examination proved to be cold water glue. On investigation it was found that cold water glue had been used in the house recently and no action was taken. A complaint was received of a dirty milk bottle. This had been used for the discharge of fireworks and had not been properly cleansed. A warning letter was sent to the dairy company concerned. ICE CREAM. Fifty-four samples were submitted to the methylene blue test and all were placed in grades I and II. The results are satisfactory. The methylene blue test does not provide a guarantee of safety but it does serve as a simple and practical method of grading ice-cream according to its degree of bacterial cleanliness and samples which consistently fail 22. to reach grades I or II give reasonable grounds to indicate defects in manufacture or handling requiring further investigation. The certificate giving the results of testing has the following note appended: "Owing to the numerous factors governing the hygienic quality of ice-cream it is unwise to pay too much attention to the bacteriological results of any single sample. Judgement should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested over a six monthly period 50 per cent of vendors samples should fall into grade I, 80 per cent into grades I or II, not more than 20 per cent into grade III and none into grade IV". The following table shows the results of samples taken since 1947: Year Samples Taken Grades I or II % Grade III % Grade IV % 1947 29 13 44.8 13 44.8 3 10.4 1948 84 55 65.4 22 26.2 7 8.4 1949 63 54 85.7 8 12.7 1 1.6 1950 85 81 95.3 4 4.7 0 - 1951 79 74 93.7 5 6.3 0 - 1952 76 71 93.4 5 6.6 0 - 1953 46 43 93.5 1 2.2 2 4.3 1954 51 39 76.5 9 17.6 3 5.9 1955 40 37 92.5 2 5.0 1 2.5 1956 52 48 92.3 4 7.7 0 - 1957 54 54 100.0 0 - 0 - It is pleasing to note that for the first time no samples were in categories III and IV. MERCHANDISE MARKS ACT. As the Council appoints an analyst for the purposes of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, they may execute any of the provisions of the Merchandise Marks Act other than those relating to importation, so far as relates to any foodstuff to which an Order in Council under the Act applies. These are administered by my department. Inspections were made but it was not necessary to take any action during the year. HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT. 1952. This Act is to ensure that adequate guards are provided for heating appliances and standards are prescribed. Visits have been made to shops selling heating appliances during the year but in all cases the appliances inspected were satisfactory. RAG FLOCK & OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT. 1951. One renewal of a licence to store rag flock was issued for a wholesale store. 23. Two premises are registered for the purposes of the Act. These are premises where upholstery work is carried on. One sample was submitted to the Prescribed Analyst who gave a satisfactory report. PET ANIMALS ACT. 1951. This Act provides for a system of licensing and inspection of pet shops by local authorities. Two applications for renewal of licences were received and after inspection and report were granted. SHOPS ACT. 1950. There are 352 shops in the Borough and inspections are made in connection with provisions of the Shops Act, 1950, which are concerned with sanitary accommodation, washing facilities, heating, lighting and ventilation. Where plans are submitted of new construction or alteration to shop premises, due consideration is given to ensure that the proposals comply with the provisions of the Act. The Public Health Inspectors are responsible for the administration of the law relating to shop hours, including early closing and Sunday trading. 175 inspections were made during the year. Most of the necessary action taken was in connection with the exhibiting of notices and the sale from shops of prohibited goods on the early closing day and Sunday Mornings. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. Certain sections of the Clean Air Act, 1956, came into operation on the 31st December, 1956, and the remainder will come into operation on the 1st June, 1958. During the year the Council adopted the model byelaws under Section 24 of the Act stipulating that in a new building only such appliances designed to burn smokeless fuels are installed for heating or cooking. They also decided to defer consideration of any action in connection with the making of smoke control areas for two years. During the year 63 visits were made in connection with smoke abatement. Equipment consisting of daily smoke and sulphur dioxide apparatus was installed and readings commenced on the 1st October, 1957. 24. The following table shows the daily average, and highest and lowest concentrations of smoke expressed in milligrammes per cubic metre and sulphur dioxide concentration as parts per 100 million volumes of air.

The Council approved the tipping of clinker and screenings by the Carshalton and the Merton and Harden Urban District Councils from the 31 st March, 1956, on a site at the rear of Brook County Primary School, Green Lane, Worcester Park. This approval was given subject to precise conditions and tipping started in July, 1957, and has proceeded steadily since that date. The site has been visited frequently said no nuisance has occurred. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION. The duties of the Council under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, were fully carried out. Householders appreciate the free service which has been maintained. A charge is made for the treatment of business premises, many of which are liable to infestation by nature of the trade carried on. The propraetors in many cases have made an annual service agreement which is a very satisfactory procedure. The resultant prompt notification of the presence of rats or mice and immediate treatment ensures that serious infestations do not occur. The Borough river boundaries, depots, sewage disposal works, refuse tips, piggeries and open spaces have received constant attention. The annual 10% test baiting of sewers was, after consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, again waived with a consequent saving of expenditure, but on the under startling that such a test and any necessary treatment would be carried out during 1958. INSECT PESTS. As in previous years the department was able to be of assistance by giving advice and help to members of the public who suffered inconvenience from insect pests. 25. The carpet beetle, clover mite and ant proved to be most troublesome and in parts of Coombe swarming flies were the cause of numerous complaints during the early autumn months. Only four rooms were treated for infestations of bugs. Thirty-five council houses were inspected for evidence of vermin and one was treated for bugs. Requests were received from a number of householders for assistance in the destruction of wasps nests. Some nests were destroyed and other requests were declined where the nests were found to be in positions not causing real inconvenience. By arrangement with the Surrey County Council six school kitchens and canteens were sprayed with a residual insecticide as a deterrent against insect infestation. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT. 1948. Under the provisions of Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, it was not necessary during the year to arrange any burials. CARAVANS. Licences were granted to station four moveable dwellings in the area. PUBLIC SEWERS. Stoppages in public sewers (combined drains) were cleared by the department on one hundred and ninety-three occasions. In a few instances the assistance of sewermen from the Borough Engineer's department had to be obtained. RAINFALL. 1957.
