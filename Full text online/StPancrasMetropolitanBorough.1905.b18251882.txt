FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Being the Report for the Year 1905. To the Right Worshipful the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Mr. Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors,— I—INTRODUCTION. I have the honour to present to you the Fiftieth Annual Report upon the vital and sanitary condition of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Although the Registration District of St. Pancras has remained practically the same area since 1856, except for a few adjustments of boundary described in the Report for the year 1J00, the changes in the areas of the Registration Sub-Districts since the last mentioned date have been so great that it lias been found necessary to insert as a frontispiece to this Report the small maps of them in previous and present use. These three small maps show the areas (1) previous to 1900 (2), at the Census in 1901, and (3) at the present time. (The two south Southern Sub-Districts, although still separate, are amalgamated in the statistics for the present year, as it is intended to amalgamate them at some future date, and for the sake of continuity it is desirable not to have to make any further changes in the statistical records.) METEOROLOGICAL RECORDS. Here follow the Meteorological Records for the year as deduced from •observations made at Greenwich and at Camden Square. 12 METEOROLOGICAL TABLE FOR LONDON, 1905.

The following is the form of the weekly return of the births supplied to the Borough Council, since approved by the Local Government Board, similar to the form previously approved by the Registrar-General and by the Borough Council, and quoted in the Annual Report for last year:— Form for Return of Births to Sanitary Authority (Approved by the Local Government Board). Registration District Registration Sub-District A Return of Births Registered in the Sanitary District of during the week (or month) ending Particulars of Births. No. Cols. When and where Born. Name, if any. Sex. Name and Surname of Father. Name and Maiden Surname of Mother. Hank or Profession of Father. 1 2 3 4 5 6 24 The London County Council requires midwives practising in the County of London to send to the County Council a weekly return of the births attended by them in the following form:— LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. Name and address of Midwife List of Births attended (by a Registered Midwife) during the week ending Saturday, the day of 190 N.B.--Births occurring in Public Institutions should not be included. This form should not be used for any communication in the nature of a letter. Name of Patient. Address of Patient. Date of Confinement. Whether child still living. These returns are extracted by the London County Council, and a weekly return of the births attended in each London Borough is kindly sent by the County Council to each Borough Council, on the same form with the alteration of the words "name and address of Midwife" to "name of Metropolitan Borough Council," and of the words "a Registered Midwife" to "Registered Midwives." It will be observed that the name (if any) and the sex of the child are not stated, nor are the name and surname of the father, nor the rank or profession of the father stated. This gives rise to some little difficulty in making inquiries, not so much in regard to the sex of the child, as in reference to the legitimacy, which is a delicate subject difficult to handle directly, but which indirectly is revealed in the Registrar-General's Form, approved by the Local Government Board. A midwife can probably form her own conclusion, and it would be valuable if she would state the sex of the child and the name of the "husband." Here follow in tabular form the results of the Registration of Births with the Registrars, and of Notification by Midwives of those births attended by them. 25 Registration of Births, 1905, showing the delay in weeks.

METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ST. PAXCRAS. 2G Notification of Births by Midwives, 1905, received from the London County Council, commencing November 11th to December 30th, 1905. Part of 4th Quarter, 1905. Notifications received from 1 to 2 weeks after Birth. West • • • 33 South • • • • 31 East • • • • 27 North 70 Total 161 N.B.—The notification returns are sent in by the miclwives at the end of each week, and the collated returns are sent out by the London County Council at the end of the following week. The two foregoing tables show the course of registration and notifications, respectively. From one to two months' delay occurs in eighty per cent. of the returns from the Registrars, and this delay was the cause of the resolution passed at the Conference in June: "That it is desirable that births should be registered within five days of their occurrence, as is required in the case of deaths by the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, and not be delayed for six weeks and longer, as now by law permitted," which resolution was subsequently sent to the Local Government Board urging them to provide legislation on these lines. Whereas the returns from the Registrars are mainly delayed from one to two months, the returns from the London County Council are received from one to two weeks after birth, but unfortunately this only applies to about 15 per cent., and about 85 per cent, of the birth returns are not so accelerated. The only manner in which it would appear possible to obtain a knowledge of births within one or two days of their occurrence is by voluntary notification ; and the payment of one shilling per case as in Huddersfield. Huddersfield lodged an Omnibus Bill in Parliament in November containing, amongst others, the following clauses in reference to the Notification of Births:— 1. —In the case of every child born within the Borough after the commencement of this Act it shall be the duty of the father of the child if he is actually residing in the house where the birth takes place at the time of its occurrence, or in his abscnce of any person in attendance upon the mother at the time of the birth or within six hours thereafter, to send or give notice of the birth to the medical officer within forty-eight hours after such birth. Every person required by this section to give or send such notice who fails without reasonable excuse to give or send the same shall be liable on summary conviction in manner provided by the Summary Jurisdiction Acts to a fine not exceeding twenty shillings, including costs for each offence: Provided 27 always that if a person required to give notice as aforesaid satisfies the court that he had reasonable grounds to suppose that notice had been duly given he shall not be liable to any fine under this section. 2.—The corporation shall pay to the father or person aforesaid who notifies a birth under the provisions of this section a fee of one shilling. 3.—-Any registrar of births and deaths whose sub-district or any part thereof is situated within the borough shall at all reasonable times have access to the notices of birth received by the medical officer of health under the provisions of this section, or to any book in which such notices maybe recorded, for the purpose of obtaining information concerning births that have occurred within his sub-district. 4.—The notification required to be made under this section shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, the requirements of the General Acts relating to the registration of births and deaths. 5.—The corporation shall cause to be given public notice of the effect of the provisions of this section by advertisement in the local newspapers and by handbills, and shall give formal notice thereof by registered post to every medical practitioner in the Borough and any other registered medical practitioner known to be in practice in the Borough, and to all women duly registered as midwives or known to be practising midwifery within the- Borough, and otherwise in such manner as the corporation think sufficient, and this section shall come into operation at such time not being less than one month after the first publication of such an advertisement as aforesaid as the corporation may fix. 6.—The provisions of this section shall cease to be in force within the Borough at the expiration of five years from the date of the passing of the Act unless they shall have been continued by Act of Parliament or by Provisional Order made by the Local Government Board and confirmed by Parliament, which Order the Local Government Board are hereby empowered to make in accordance with the provisions of the Public Health Act, 187-5.

An additional Woman Inspector was appointed in September, 1904, with the duty, amongst other duties, of paying special attention to infantile mortality, and the welfare of mothers and sucklings. She lias her work initiated by the births, instead of by infectious diseases, complaints, and premises to be periodically inspected, and makes inquiry into, and advises as to the feeding of babies and sucklings, in addition ascertaining the condition of the dwelling house, of the mother's workplace (if any), an i of the milk and other food supply, so that the Public Health, Factory and Workshops Act, and Food and Drugs Acts, respectively, may be put into force at the proper time and place. In December, 1904, I reported upon Infantile Mortality to the following effect: — 1.—The first point is the recognized fact that the general death-rate is decreasing, but that the infantile mortality-rate, or the proportion of deaths of infants under one year to one thousand births, during the same period is not decreasing, but on the contrary is either stationary or is showing a tendency to increase in the most populous localities. This is exhibited in the following table of decennial rates during the last half century in England and Wales, London, and St. Pancras : England and Wales London. Saint Pancras. Birth-rate per 10C0 population. Death-rate per 1000 population Infantile Mor talitv rate per 1000 births. Birth-rate per 1000 population. Death-rate per 1000 population. Infantile Mortality rate per 1000 births. Birth-rate per 1000 population. Death-rate per 1000 population. Infantile Mor tality rate per 1000 births. 1851-60 34.1 22.2 154 33.6 23.7 155 — — — 1861-70 35.2 22.5 154 35.4 24.4 162 34.4 232 161 1871-80 35.4 21.4 149 35 4 22.5 158 34.6 22.1 158 1881-90 32.5 19.1 142 33.2 20.5 152 31.7 20.3 154 1891-1900 29.9 18.2 154 30.2 19.6 160 28.8 20.0 167 31 2.—The second point is to ascertain whether any changes have taken place in the causes from which infants die. In the Report of the Physical Deterioration Committee, Vol. I., page 132, Dr. Tatham has supplied a table for two periods of five years—1873-77 and 1898-1902—showing the male and female infantile mortality rates from 19 causes in a group of urban and in a group of rural counties. The urban counties show an increase of infantile mortality of about 4 per 1000 births, and the rural counties a decrease of somewhat over 1 per 1000. Dr. Tatham savs:—"The causes which contributed to maintain the total infantile mortality at about its former level were diarrhceal diseases (including enteritis and gastro-enteritis), diseases of the stomach and liver, pneumonia, premature birth, and congenital malformation. The increase of pneumonia mortality is coincident with an increased fatality of that, disease in the general population, and although this increase between the two quinquennia is proportionally large, it counts but little against the decrease from the other causes just mentioned. With diarrhceal diseases and with premature birth and congenital defects the case is far different, the increased mortality from these causes being very marked. Taking together diarrlioeal diseases and diseases ot the stomach and liver, the recent five years show an increase of more than 70 per cent, in the urban and of nearly 70 per cent. in the rural counties. From premature birth and congenital defects the increase, though numerically smaller, was proportionally even greater than that from diarrhceal diseases. Among males in the urban counties the rate had increased by 70 per cent., and among females by 61 per cent., while in the rural counties it had increased by 74 per cent. in each sex." He then adds that "more accurate certification of the cause of death has been secured in recent years. This would probably tend to a transfer of deaths from indefinite to definite headings, but the changes of mortality indicated in the above comments are so well marked that they probably represent with approximate accuracy the changes that have actually taken place, apart from this disturbing influence." I have had Dr. Tatham's table reduced so as to show the points to which he lias drawn attention, and set out as follows :— 32 Average rate of infant mortality under one voar per 1000 births, among male and female infants, severally, in two groups of Counties in England and Wales, in the opening i\nd dosing quinquennia of tho last quarter of a century. Causes of Death. Urban Counties. Rural Counties. Males. Females. Males. Females. 1873-1877 1898-1902 1873-1877 1898-1902 1873-1877 1898-1902 1873-1877 1898-1902 A.

In the Fifty-fourth Annual Report of the Registrar-General (1891) is an analysis of the Infantile Mortality per 1000 births during 1889 to 1891 in the three counties where it was. lowest, namely, Herefordshire, Wiltshire, and Dorsetshire, and in the three towns where it was highest, namely, Preston, Leicester, and Blackburn. As a comparison between the effect of the country and of the town upon infant life, it is valuable as showing how more and more progressively destructive the town is to infant life from week to week and month to month until the sixth month of life is reached, remaining at a not very much lower point throughout the rest of the year, compared with the country. Unfortunately, since then the ages at death of infants have not been extracted by weeks and months for any year or series of years, so that for want of the necessary data, the past age incidence cannot be compared with the present age incidence at death, nor the changes, if any, ascertained. In these circumstances I have chosen two years, five and-twenty years apart, of similar summer temperature and total infantile mortality, in St. Pancras, and with the assistance of Mr. Moon, the deaths of infants under one year have been specially extracted from the weekly death returns according to ages in weeks and months, and to certain causes, and have been classified in the following tables, and the proportions calculated per 1000 births. It will be observed in the lowest lines of each of the tables that the total infantile mortality for the whole of the first year of life in 1901 was 2-3 per 1000 higher than in 1876, but that for the second half of the year the mortality in 1901 was 7 per 1000 lower than in 1876, and for the first half of the year was 9-3 higher. It will also be seen that the mortality of the two middle quarters of the year, when added together, is the same in 1901 as in 1876, so that the change that has taken place between 1876 and 1901 is a fall in the mortality of the last quarter of the first year of life of 6 per 1000 and a rise in the first quarter of 8.4 per 1000, or, adding these two quarters together, a total divergence of 14.4 per 1000; even deducting the whole of the original difference of 2.3, there remains a total divergence between 1876 and 1901 of 12.1 per 1000, a sufficiently striking change. Further, if we analyse the three months of the first quarter we find that the whole of the rise has been in the first month of life. Further still, if we analyse the first four weeks of life we again find that the rise is almost confined to the first week of life, a rise of mortality of no less than 9.1 per 1000 births, or an increase of the 1901 rate upon the 1876 rate of nearly 50 per cent. This would indicate that infants are dying at a younger age than twenty-five years ago in St. Pancras, whereas, as stated above, the Registrar-General found in 1891 that the effect of town life was to increase the mortality of infants as they grow older up to the sixth month as compared with country life. 34 (i) ST.

A. Premature birth and congenital defects +8.8 -+0.2 +0.2 B. Diarrhoea, Dysentery, Cholera, Enteritis, and Gastro-Enteritis +1.6 +5.4 +3.0 +2.3 C. Diseases of stomach and liver +1.4 +0.2 +0.4 +0.2 B and C +3.0 +5.6 +3.4 +2.5 A and B and C +12.1 +5.8 +3.4 +2.5 Other Diseases -3.5 -4.9 -4.4 -8.5 Total +8.4 +0.9 -1.0 -6.0 From other Diseases than those specified as A, B, and C, the mortality per 1000 births in the last three months of the first year of life has fallen much more than that in the first three months. From the A, B, and C classes the mortality has risen very much more in the first than in the last three months, and considerably more in the second than in the third three months. From the B and C classes, that is, abdominal diseases of infants, the mortality has risen most in the second and has fallen most in the fourth three months. From the A class alone the rise is confined almost to the first quarter, and is by far the highest rise of the three classes regarded separately. Putting the tables in another form we obtain the following results:— Total Infantile Mortality per 1000 Births in 1901 as compared with 1876— Period of Life. Eise or Fall. 1st week = + 9.1. 2nd to 4th week inclusive . . = Stationary. 1 st month = + 9.8. 2nd to 6th month inclusive = Stationary. 7th to 12th month inclusive = — 7.0. 37 This shows that if the year is divided into three parts consisting of the first month, the next five months, and the last six months, during the last period there was a fall in the mortality of 7 per 1000 births, during the middle period the mortality was stationary, and during the first period there was a rise of 9'8 per 1000, almost corresponding to the fall of 7 in the last period added to the total rise for the whole year, namely, 2'3. Again, if the first four weeks are divided into two parts, one consisting of the last three weeks and the other of the first week, during the former the mortality was stationary, during the latter it rose 91 per 1000 births between 1876 and 1901. These changes indicate an increased immaturity of infants at birth, which cannot be due to artificial feeding; this diminished viability hi all probability continues in a considerable proportion of the children that survive during the early weeks and months of life, so as to render them more liable to succumb to adverse circumstances. These later adverse circumstances are seen to produce their greatest effect in the second three months of life when the greatest rise in mortality is caused by bowel complaints. This is also the period when the largest proportion of children unready for artificial food appear to have been weaned and fed upon it, and it is well established that the artificial feeding of young infants leads to a high mortality during the summer or third quarter of the year. Therefore, statistics indicate that in order to diminish infantile mortality it is necessary to ameliorate, firstly, the pre-natal conditions, and secondly, the post-natal conditions, and that during both periods efforts should be first exhausted upon theimother before confining attention to the infant. The deaths of infants from debility, atrophy, etc., also confirm these conclusions as shown in the following table, where it is seen that there has been a total increase of 7.1 per 1000 births, that there has been an increase in each of the four periods of three months, and that the increase has been progressively greater towards the youngest periods :— 38 St. Pancras. .Deaths under 1 year from Debility, Atrophy, etc., in 1876 and 1901, and Rates per 1000 Births. 1876.

In February, 1905, I further reported to this effect: — In the previous Report it was indicated that efforts to reduce infantile mortality have hitherto been mainly directed towards improving the artificial food and feeding of infants of suckling age, thus encouraging mothers to wean their sucklings at an increasingly earlier age ; that hitherto 110 systematic effort appears to have been made to improve the health of suckling mothers in order to provide through them the best form of nourishment for their young infants, and delay weaning until the infants are more capable of separate existence; that little or 110 general attention has been directed towards improving the health of pregnant mothers so as to prepare them for suckling their infants when born, and for endowing them before birth with more viable constitutions. It was shown that mortality statistics in St. Pancras indicate that infants are dying at a younger and younger age, apparently due to increased immaturity at birth, diminished viability or capacity for survival, and increased artificial feeding. Dr. Tatham, at Somerset House, kindly called my attention to the fact that figures are available for London since 1888 in the Registrar.General's Returns, showing the number of deaths of infants under one year in the first and second three months, and the last six months of the year. From these numbers the mortality per 1000 births is calculated in the following table:— LONDON. Infantile Mortality per 1000 1 tirths. Months. 0—3 3—6 0—6 6—12 0—12 1888 to 1892 69.1 31.6 100.7 50.7 151.4 1893 to 1897 73.5 33.8 107.4 51.3 158.7 1898 to 1901 74.5 34.9 109.4 51.6 161.0 These figures tell a similar story for London as was told for St. Pancras. The total infantile mortality has risen, but the rise has been much greater in the first six months of the twelve than in the last. 40 The conclusions drawn from he statistics of St. Pancras, and now corroborated by those of London, were "that in order to diminish infantile mortality it is necessary to ameliorate, firstly, the pre-natal conditions, and, secondly, the post-natal conditions, and that efforts should be first exhausted upon the mother before confining attention to the infant," and in this spirit the preventive scheme was conceived. Then followed an elaboration of the preventive scheme sketched in the previous Report, which was then being put into operation. On the 5th of June a Conference on the Prevention of Infantile Mortality was held at the Town Hall. This Conference, welcomed by His Worship the Mayor, Alderman Frederick Purchese, J.P., M.A.B., and presided over by Councillor Dr. R. M. Beaton, L C.C , Chairman of the Public Health Committee, was attended and supported by a large number of expert and leading men and women, including Sir William Broadbent, Sir Lauder Brunton, E. R. r. Moon, M.P., Professor Herbert Spencer, Mrs. Scharlieb, M.D., Miss Vaughan, M.D., Mrs. Fleming, M.I)., a considerable number of medical officers of health, ministers of religion, medical practitioners, ladies engaged in social work, nurses, and others. At this successful Conference the following resolutions were discussed and carried:— A.—Morn eks. 1.—That it is desirable that every encouragement should be given to prospective mothers to seek advice as to the management of their health so that they may endow their offspring with good constitutions and prepare themselves to suckle their infants when born. 2.—That it is desirable that all efforts should be exhausted upon improving the health of suckling mothers before devoting attention solely to their infants. B.—Bkeast-Feeding of Infants. 1.—That it is desirable that births should be registered within five days of their occurrence as is required in the case of deaths by the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, and be not delayed for six weeks and longer as now by law permitted. 2.—That it is desirable that the municipal authority should obtain weekly returns of births from the registrars. 3.—That it is desirable that the municipal authority should send to the addresses of all mothers, furnished in the weekly returns, cards or leaflets of advice, laying greatest stress on the improvement of antenatal conditions, on the preparation for and maintenance of breast feeding of infants during the first nine months of life, and strongly advising mothers not to wean their infants prematurely except upon medical advice. 4.—That it is desirable that women inspectors should be appointed with a view to the prevention of infantile mortality by selecting from the 41 weekly returns suitable cases amongst the poor for inquiry, affording general information in the hygiene of nursing, and directing the necessitous poor where to apply for such advice and assistance as may be urgently required in order to maintain breast-feeding. 5.—That it is desirable that medical practitioners, midwives, and nurses, the staffs of hospitals and dispensaries, and the religious, charitable, and social organisations should co operate with the municipal authority in endeavouring to encourage breast-feeding, and to diminish the infantile mortality. 6.—That it is desirable that any suggestions or arrangements made by medical practitioners, or by the medical charities, for the purpose of advising nursing mothers with a view to preventing infantile mortality, should be communicated to the municipal authority in order that the)' may be made known through the women inspectors. 7.—That it is desirable that the information should be spread broadcast that breast-feeding is the most economical, easy, and safe mode of feeding infants under nine months of age, with a view to reducing the number of hand-fed sucklings to the smallest proportion possible. C.—Premature Weaning. 1.—That it is undesirable that a suckling mother should be separated from her infant, or the infant from the mother, except for reasons of ill-health and under medical advice. 2.—That it is desirable that when a woman inspector has reason to believe that a suckling mother is in a necessitous condition and unprovided with sufficient food to enable her to maintain her own strength and suckle her infant as well, she should endeavour to prevent weaning by reporting the case to the charitable organisation most appropriate to deal with the circumstances. 3.—That it is desirable that when a woman inspector finds that a suckling mother has insufficient nourishment due to the husband being out of work, she should report the case to the labour bureau. 4.—That it is desirable that mothers should be urged not to wean their infants until the ninth month of age except upon medical advice. 5.—That it is desirable that mothers should be warned that the hand feeding of infants is expensive, troublesome, and unsatisfactory, risky at all times, and in summer dangerous and often fatal. 6.—That with a view not to cncourage premature weaning, it is desirable that milk for the hand feeeing of infants provided privately or publicly by milk depots at or below cost should be distributed upon the orders of medical practitioners. 42 D.—Hand Feeding of Infants. 1.—That, having reduced the number of sucklings required to be handfed to the smallest proportion possible, means should be devised for providing suitable milk for the remainder. 2.—That it is undesirable to encourage the use of pasteurised or sterilised milk for the use of hand-fed infants who unfortunately cannot be fed from the breast. 3.—That it is desirable that cow's milk intended for hand-fed infants should be milked, transported, and distributed under special precautions. 4.—That the special precautions required in the production of cow's milk for infants should include not only care in the selection, testing, and feeding of the cows, but also care in their pasturing, sheltering and tending; not only extreme cleanliness in milking, but also rigid aseptic precautions, accompanied by immediate refrigeration, maintained during transport, and by prompt dispatch so that the number of micro-organisms and the lactic acid in the milk may be reduced to a minimum at the time of delivery instead of the hundreds of thousands and millions of organisms and excess of lactic acid now to be found in so-called fresh milk. 5.—That, in order to prevent the pollution of infants' milk in distribution and in the home, it is desirable that it should be protected in stoppered bottles ready for feeding, and not be transferred to other bottles. 6.—That on account of the facilities that hand-feeding affords for the over-feeding and under feeding of infants, due to want of knowledge, especially amongst the poor, it is desirab'e that the quantity and quality of milk required for cach feed at the particular age should be distributed in a separate stoppered bottle, and that each basket or crate of bottles for use should be accompanied by instructions as to the frequency and manner of feeding. 7.—That the provision of cow's milk produced under aseptic conditions accompanied by extreme cleanliness, refrigeration and dispatch, so diluted and enriched and put up in stoppered bottles in such quantities, to be administered at specified intervals suitable for suckling infants, should be regarded not only as ordinary food, but in the nature of medical assistance. 8.—That for the special protection of hand-fed infants it is desirable that Municipal Authorities should not only ascertain the quality of milk intended for infants by chemical analysis, and receive from the public analyst a statement of the percentage composition of each sample of milk submitted, as to fat, solids not fat, and total solids, and the absence of chemical preservatives, but also by bacteriological examination, and receive from a bacteriologist a statement in regard to each sample of milk submitted as to the cleanliness and freshness of the milk. 43 The scheme as elaborated proceeded on these lines: — Weekly returns of registered births are received from the Registrars and indexed. From the weekly returns of the registered deaths received from the Registrars the deaths of infants under one year of age are extracted and indexed. By means of the indexes the entries of the births terminating in death before the end of the year are annotated with the date of the death. At the beginning of the year the following; Card of "Advice to Mothers" was drawn up and a copy of this is sent to the mother of every newly-born child as soon as possible after the birth is notified, and by means of doctors, hospitals, dispensaries, midwives, nurses, ministers of religion, mothers' meetings, maternity missions, and personal applicants, also to expectant mothers. .ST. PANCRAS BOROUGH COUNCIL. Public Health Department. Advice to Mothers. The St. Pancras Borough Council find:— (1) That a large number of infants are born before full time and die soon after birth; (2) That a large number of full time infants are born so feeble as to live only a few weeks ; (3) That a large number of infants are not suckled at the breast after being born; (4) That a large number of infants who are suckled at the breast for a few weeks are weaned too early; (5) That it is cheaper and easier to feed infants by the breast than by hand; (6) That it is simpler and wiser to cultivate the mother's health, both before and after the birth of her infant, and to improve the breast milk than to supplement or supplant it by hand feeding; (7) That the hand feeding of infants is generally unsatisfactory, always risky, and in the summer dangerous and often fatal. In these circumstances an appeal is made to all mothers to aid in practising and spreading a knowledge of the following system:— Mothering. The health of the mother is most important of all. The mother must cultivate her health so as to endow h sr infant with a good constitution, and prepare herself to suckle her baby. 44 Spirits and strong drink must bo avoided; plenty of good, plain, wholesome,. nourishing food must be eaten, and the appetite improved by exercise in the open air. A mother who improves her own health will also improve that of her baby. When in doubt as to her health or habits a mother should not hesitate to seek medical advice forthwith. Suckling. A mother who has properly cultivated her health should be able to fully suckle her baby when born. She should not be disappointed if the breast milk is scanty or not fully established for two or three days. The regular suckling of the baby will cause the flow to increase more and more. If she continue to cultivate her health she should be able to continue suckling her baby for about nine months. The best food for the baby is mother's breast milk alone and without any other food whatever. If the mother have miik which is poor in quality she should improve her diet by eating a greater quantity of good, plain, wholesome food, and improve her appetite for this diet by more exercise in the open air, and above all things should avoid spirits and strong drink. If a mother have not enough milk the same measures will increase the quantity, and a cupful or two of milk half an hour before suckling will be an excellent help towards this, as the only way to humanise cows' milk is to pass it through the mother and not Through a machine. The nipples should be cleansed and dried each time after suckling. The baby should be suckled every two hours (gradually prolonged to two and a half) during tho first three months, gradually prolonged to every three hours during the second three and subsequent months. Also twice in the night during the first month, once during the second month, and in the third month night feeding should be gradually discontinued. As the feeds are reduced in number the quantity of milk at each feed naturally increases. Weaning. The cutting of the teeth of the baby is nature's intimation to think of weaning. A baby's teeth may be expected to commence cutting between the seventh and the ninth month. The usual time for weaning is about the ninth month. Weaning becomes easier and safer if it is delayed until after the ninth month, soon after which the breast milk should be altogether stopped. 45 Not until the eighth or ninth month, or the teeth arc being cut, is a baby able to digest farinaceous foods, such as baked flour, powdered biscuit, small crumbled bread, and fine oatmeal, and these foods should never be given to a baby until the teeth commence to appear. On no account should portions of the ordinary food or drink of the mother when at meals be given to the baby; they may prove injurious and even fatal. Weaning before Time. A mother should not wean her baby before the seventh month at the very earliest, as weaning before time is dangerous to the baby. Every effort should be made to postpone weaning until after the hot weather has come and gone, as the months of July, August, and September are particularly fatal to hand fed babies. If the health of the suckling mother or of the baby is failing, medical advice should be sought with a view to avoiding weaning. If the health of the mother or the breast milk cannot be improved and medical advice is given that weaning or supplementing the breast milk is absolutely essential, then the necessary food and feeding of the hand fed baby should be medically directed, and the baby should be periodically seen and examined by the medical adviser. A hand-fed baby's progress should be very carefully watched, and upon the slightest suspicion of derangement or want of progress, medical advice should be immediately sought, especially if there be any diarrhoea, as illness in a baby develops rapidly and is soon past remedying. Medical advice can be obtained by a mother from her private medical attendant, or at the various public medical charities, according to her means. Further information may be obtained from the Women Inspectors, to whom messages may be addressed, at the Public Health Department, Town Hall, Pancras Road, N.W. John F. J. Sykes, Medical Officer of Health. From the weekly returns of births the more suitable cases to visit are selected, commencing in the poorest streets. The Woman Inspector is assisted in this work by a number of ladies, varying from 12 to 18, who act as Voluntary Visitors, and the inquiry made is in the following form:— METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ST. PANCRAS. Public Health Department. Inquiry as to Suckling. Visit immediately after Notification of Birth, before any chance of removal takes place.

General hygienic information is given to the mother, and great stress is laid upon the importance of maintaining the health of the mother during the expectant and suckling period, and in the case of any derangement, and above all before weaning, to seek medical advice. The following leaflet as to obtaining "Medical Advice" is provided for the guidance of the Women Inspectors, voluntary Lady Visitors, and other advisors of expectant or suckling mothers: — 47 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ST. PANCRAS. Fublic Health Department. Medical Advice to Mothers and Sucklings as to Feeding. In the card of Advice to Mothers distributed in St. Pancras it is urged (1) that when in doubt as to her health and habits before the birth of her child, the mother should not hesitate to seek medical advice at once; (2) that if the health of the suckling mother or of the baby is failing, medical advice should be sought with a view to avoiding weaning ; (3) that a suckling infant should not be weaned until after nine months old except upon medical advice, and that the suckling- weaned before time should be taken from time to time to the Doctor for advice as to proper food and feeeding. Medical advice may be obtained by mothers, according to their circumstances, from— 1. Specialist Medical Practitioners. 2. General Medical Practitioners. 3. Private Surgeries and Dispensaries. 4. Provident Dispensaries. 5. Hospital Out-Patient Departments. 6. Medical Missions. 7. Poor Law Dispensaries. Mothers resorting to either of the first three for advice will choose their own personal Medical Attendants. With regard to the last four for the provident, impecunious, necessitous, and destitute, the information set out below will be useful to mothers. Any further information may be obtained from Miss Gardiner, Woman Inspector, Town Hall, Pancras Road, N.W. John F. J. Sykes, Medical Officer of Health. 4.—PROVIDENT DISPENSARIES.

Here follows the Report of Miss Gardiner, Woman Inspector, upon this subject:— To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, Herewith I beg to submit a report of the work done during the year 1905, in connection with the efforts being made in St. Pancras to lessen the deathrate amongst Infants under 12 months of age. This work comprised among other things :— 1. The distribution of Cards of Advice to Mothers. 2. Personal Pints to Mothers, after (and when possible, before), the birth of the baby. 3. The referring of the Mothers and Infants to :— («) Private Doctors, Provident Dispensaries, Hospitals, &c., for the necessary treatment to induce and prolong natural feeding. (b) Various Religious and Charitable Organisations when the mother herself was in need of extra food and milk, in order that she might be able to continue suckling her baby. 4. The Conference on Infantile Mortality. (June 5th, 1905). 50 5. A Special Inquiry into the deaths of Infants from Zymotic Diarrhoear during the months of July, August and September. 6. The compiling of various especial Reports and Statistics, and other clerical work, in connection with the Infant Inquiry. To consider the above items, more in detail:— I.—Distribution of Advice Cards both after and before the birth of the baby. (a) After the Birth of the baby. 1. An Advice Card was sent by post to the mother of every infant registered in St. Pancras during the year (a total of about 5,800), immediately after the receipt of the Birth Returns each week (average 112 a week). 2. An Advice Card was sent bv post to the mothers attended by the registered Midwives immediately after the receipt of the London County Council list of these mothers, which was sent in (from November, 1905), weekly, within a week or two of the birth (average 18 a week). (b) Before the Birth of the Baby. J. Packets of Advice Cards were delivered to the various Hospitals, Provident Dispensaries, Registered Midwives, Maternity Nursing Associations, &c., in the district; and at the same time I asked when the Doctor, Midwife, or Nurse was engaged, some weeks or months previous to the birth, that the Advice Card (urging the importance of natural feeding), might be given to the expectant mother. 2. Packets of Advice Cards were sent with a circular letter from you, as- Medical Officer of Health, to the Clergymen and Ministers of every Church, Chapel, &c., in St. Pancras, to be placed in the hands of the Mothers' Meetings, Maternity Missions, &c., so that by this means, too, the mothers might receive them some time previously, or that a card might be olaced in each "Maternity bag" given out on the day of birth. 3. Separate Advice Cards were sent by post or delivered by myself in response to a special written or verbal request for one, from prospective mothers who had heard of their distribution, after the birth,, and had desired to have one earlier. 4. Packets of Advice Cards were delivered by me to the Workhouse (Maternity Ward), "Homes of Hope," and other Institutions where unmarried women were received before their confinement. 5. Packets of Advice Cards were also sent to some medical practitioners wishing to distribute them early to their patients. II.—Personal Visits to Mothers, after (and occasionally before), the birth of the child. During these visits, in the course of conversation, and with asking as few as possible direct questions, much information as to the condition and environment of the infant was elicited and entered afterwards upon 31 the Inquiry form, and by means of these filled in forms, useful facts and statistics were gathered. (See Tables IIIa, IIIb, IVa, IYb, and Appendix I re Mode of Feeding, Weaning, and Causes of Weaning.) Further, too, at the same time we were able to impress upon the mothers the all importance of the instruction set forth on the cards of "Advice to Mothers." These visits were made by myself throughout the whole year, and by Miss Bibbv during the early part of the year, and during the last quarter by the Voluntary Visitors, who thus gave us valuable assistance in the Infant Inquiry work. Had it not been for their help, many of the poorest babies of St. Pancras would of necessity have been left unvisited, and so we have to thank especially Miss Neville and Miss Stewart for undertaking to help us with some of this work. A meeting of the Voluntary Visitors was held once a fortnight at the Town Hall, when any cases, especially difficult to deal with, were discussed and referred to me; and at the meetings I gave a course of instruction as to the various points to be dealt with, particularly in this visiting of mothers and infants. It was encouraging to find that with very few exceptions, the mothers received the Women Sanitary Inspectors and Voluntary Visitors most cordially, often asking them to call again ; and the numerous letters and calls that I received at the Town Hall from mothers, asking for further suggestions and advice, also testified to the fact that they did not resent our visits. One good result of our visits was, that any sanitary defects about a house where a birth had occurred (which defects might otherwise have escaped notice), were either evident to us when we entered the home, or else would be especially pointed out to us by the mother, who, noticing from our visiting cards, that we were Sanitary Inspectors, was anxious to get the evil remedied. Information was also obtained with regard to any work-place attended by the mother, and also as to the food supply. Similarly too, the far too frequent cases of pulmonary phthisis amongst the mothers (and fathers) of St. Pancras, were incidentally met with during our visits ; and an opportunity was thus afforded us of giving to the patient (probably up till then, unattended by a Doctor) an " introduction card " to a Doctor or Hospital, as well as the leaflet of the "National Association for the Prevention of Consumption," setting forth the means to be taken to prevent the spread of this disease. In several instances, I referred mothers, who were evidently consumptive, and yet suckling their babies, to a Doctor or Hospital, in order that the}" might be medically advised. 52 III.—Referring Mothers to :— (a) Doc'ors, Dispensaries, Hospitals, etc.— One of the most useful parts of the work in connection with the infant visiting was the early detection of the mothers (or infants) who appeared to be in more or less urgent need of medical attention; and the St. Pancras Borough Council cards, which we gave as a sort of introduction of the mother from you (as Medical Officer of Health) to the particular Doctor, Dispensary, or Hospital that she usually attended, and asking for especial attention to be paid to her iu regard to the suckling of her infants have, in many instances, been productive of much good. The leaflets which were printed towards the end of the year, with details as to the hours, terms, &c , of the different Hospitals, Provident Dispensaries, Medical Missions, &c., gave useful information to the mothers needing medical treatment for themselves and their infants. (b) Religious and Charitable Agencies— In cases where we found that the mother, from an insufficiency of food and milk for herself, would be unable to continue "nursing" her baby, or babies (in the case of twins), we referred her for help and extra nourishment to the Churih or Chapel that she attended : or to the Charity Organization Society who, in nearly every instance, after investigating the case, found it a suitable one, and likely to benefit by temporary help, and so gave milk and eggs, etc., to the mother, to tide her over the most critical period. This food was especially useful, as a complement to the medicines prescribed by the Doctors, as otherwise tonics, such as quinine, would have been practically useless, as the appetite engendered by them could not have been satisfied. IV.—The Conference on Infantile Mortality, convened by the Health Committee, with the approval of the Council, was held at the Town Hall, Pancras Road, on June 5th, 1905. The Conference consisted of Members of Parliament representing the Borough, Members of the County Council representing St. Pancras, Members of the Borough Council, Leaders of the Medical Profession, Medical Specialists in the treatment of women and children, &c. For the Resolutions adopted, see Minutes of the Borough Council of July 12th, 1905. V-—Special Inquiry into Deaths of Infants (under 12 months of age) from Zymotic Diarrhoea. During the 3rd quarter, July, August, and September, I systematically visited every house where a death of a baby from diarrhoea had occurred, thinking the information as to the feeding, and conditions and environment, of the babies who had died of this disease, taken in conjunction with the previously gained information as to the feeding and environment of healthy babies, might be of some future value, with regard to the aetiology of zymotic epidemic, or summer diarrhoea. 53 For this present report, however, a few only of the facts gathered are given in Appendix II. (pages 60, 61, and 62); and it seems that no real conclusions should be drawn until the history of the feeding, conditions, and environment of the diarrhoea cases which survived, can be studied concurrently with that of those cases which ended fatally. And it would be difficult to do this comparative work unless zymotic diarrhoea could be made for a time, say July, August, and September, a notifiable disease. VI.—Especial Reports and Inquiries. (a) Registration of Births. 1. In conjunction with Mr. .Moon and Mr. Stuart, the varying intervals between every birth in St. Pancras during the year 1905, and the corresponding Birth Registration. 2. The varying intervals between the Death Registration of all the Infants (under 3 months of age) who had died in St. Pancras during the year 1905, and the corresponding Birth Registration. (See Appendix III., Tables b and c.) (b) Illegitimate Infants. The numbers that are born and die in the whole of St. Pancras, in the Workhouse, &c. The Illegitimate Infant Mortality Rate. Why the mothers of Illegitimate Children are not systematically visited. (c) Various Inquiries as to " Nursery Milk" and " Patent Foods "sold in St. Pancras and especially recommended by the maker, for Infants from Birth upwards. Statistics as to " Married women in factories and Infant Mortality," &c. Attached hereto are six Tables numbered I., II., IIIa, IIIb, IVa, and IVb, dealing with:— Number of Births in weekly Returns and of visits paid. Comparison between Death Rates of Legitimate and Illegitimate Children. The mode of Feeding of Infants (under 12 months). Age of Weaning of Infants (under 12 months). Attached hereto are also three Appendices numbered I., II., and III., being respectively Special Reports on:— Causes of Premature Weaning.

Registration of Deaths of Infants (under 3 months of age) during 1905. Table A.— Illegitimates = 63. Search for Birth Registration not made. (Reasons see below). Total Deaths = 425 Legitimates = 372 Birth Registration not found = 61 †(Reasons see below). Birth Registration found = 311 (See Tables B and C). * Re Illegitimate Cases.—In Tables B and C the 53 deaths of Illegitimate Infants under 3 months are omitted as the search for the birth-registration of these was so often unsuccessful for the following reasons:— (1) Untraceable name or address, or no previous address was given when the death was registered. (2) Though the death had occurred in St. Pancras the birth had taken place outside St. Pancras in a Lying-in Hospital or elsewhere. (3) Though the deaths of newly-born babies (9 cases) found in the streets of St. Pancras were registered, yet the births of these had not been registered. †Re Legitimate Cases.—Of the 372 registered deaths, search for birth-registration was successful in only 311 cases. The reasons why the search was unsuccessful in the remaining 61 cases were:— (1) The address where the death had occurred was different from the one at which the birth had taken place, because (a) The baby may have died in one house of St. Pancras, but have been born in another house of St. Pancras. (b) The baby may have died within St. Pancras but have been born outside St. Pancras (when naturally the birth would be registered outside). (e) Occasionally the death is registered from an incorrect address and the birth from a correct one, or vice versa. (2) Of the deaths registered as occurring in "outlying" institutions, it is often impossible to find the birth registration, as neither the christian nor surname of the baby or parent is given in the Death Returns (with rare exceptions). (3) It is possible that if a death takes place at, say, 5 weeks of age and before the birth has been registered, the parents may sometimes neglect to register the birth at all. Search was made into the 311 deaths of legitimate infants under 3 months of age (whose birth registration could be found), with the following results:— See Tables B. and C. 64 Table B.—The number of weeks interval between registration of birth and of death was— 0 weeks in 197 cases.[/##3] 1 „ 25 „ 2 „ 19 „ 3 „ 11 „ 4 „ 14 „ 5 „ 12 „ 6 „ 15 „ 7 „ 5 „ 8 „ 4 „ 9 to 12 „ * Birth registered 1 or 2 weeks after death in 0 „ 9 „ 311 Due possibly to death having been registered from a Hospital of one district and the birth having been registered in the district in which it took place.

It is well to know that unrecognised cases largely spread infectious diseases. Discovery.—Mild cases of indisposition or disease excite no particular attention or are attributed to other than the real cause by parents, guardians, or friends, and are not submitted to medical examination. When cases of suspected infectious diseases are discovered there is sometimes considerable difficulty and delay in making an exact medical diagnosis in certain types of the diseases. Here bacteriological and additional clinical examination arc brought to bear upon doubtful types, and to check or confirm the diagnosis. Bacteriological Test.—The number of specimens of secretion, blood and sputum submitted to bacteriological tests during the year in suspected cases of Diphtheria, Typhoid or Enteric Fever, and Tuberculosis, and the results of examination were as follows:— Bacillus found. Doubtful. Bacillus not found. Total. Diphtheria (Secretion) 24 67 91 Reaction obtained. Doubtful. Reaction not obtained. Total. Typhoid (Blood) 21 5 23 49 Bacillus found. Doubtful.

Tuberculosis (Sputum) 11 21 32 Infectious Diseases fall into four categories— (a) Permanent compulsorily notifiable diseases, (b) Voluntarily notifiable diseases, (c) Temporarily compulsorily notifiable diseases, and (d) Non-notifiable diseases. 66 § 2 -NOTIFICATION AND DISEASES.

SCARLET FEVER. At the end of August an outbreak of scarlet fever commenced at the Foundling Hospital. This Institution is peculiar in many respects. It is in the position of a day school, a residential school, and a residential school without dispersal for the holidays, in regard to infectious disease. A number of persons enter the Institution daily, Including teachers, purveyors, visitors, etc., and on Sunday many visitors and children, so that the risks of importation of infection are as great as in a day school. It is a residential school, but with this great disadvantage, that upon the outbreak of infectious disease the school cannot be dispersed, and the non-infected children sent home out of the danger zone. The Institution, so to speak, stews in its own juice until the infectious disease burns itself out. The more care exercised and the greater protection afforded the children, by the mere absence of scarlet fever for a number of years, causes the accumulation of such a large number of susceptible children who have not obtained immunity by a previous attack, that at last the smallest, spark will set the whole Institution in the blaze of an outbreak. Every precaution was taken from the very commencement of the outbreak, in fact excessive precaution was taken by sending to hospital numbers of children with slight rose rashes, roughness of the throat, sickness after a meal, and other trifling, but in the circumstances, suspicious symptoms, in the hope of removing every trace of infection from the Institution.

The Steward was formerly an Assistant Steward in the service of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and thoroughly understands the methods. I can confidently assert that greater care could not have been taken in the prompt removal of suspicious cases, and the repeated and thorough disinfection and cleansing, often on a large scale. The repeated examinations of all the children in the Institution made by the Medical Officers was also as thorough as could be desired. The return of a large number of suspicious cases, removed about the end of the first week of the outbreak, after a prolonged period of observation in hospital (apart from the infected cases in hospital) reduces the outbreak at this period numerically to much smaller proportions, such as one would expect amongst a very susceptible community of young children. The extraordinary part of the outbreak is the persistence with which at short intervals a few cases continued to occur until the beginning of the following year, in spite of complete medical examinations of all children, and of repeated and thorough disinfection and cleansing. It gives rise to the question whether, as in diphtheria, scarlet fever may be communicable before the rash appears, and even without the appearance of any rash, in fact whether, as in diphtheria, there may be carrier cases. Unfortunately the scarlet fever organism not having been definitely isolated and studied, the point cannot be proved as it has been proved in the case of diphtheria. The main building of the Foundling Hospital consists of a central block facing south, and two wings facing east and west, enclosing a quadrangle on three sides, the fourth of which is open towards the main entrance in Guilford Street. The centre block contains the Chapel (and school-rooms), the west wing the Boys' Dormitories and Dining Rooms, the east wing the Girls' Dormitories and Dining Rooms, and the Kitchens. The southern end of the east wing is the Treasurer's residence. At the time the residents in the Institution were the Treasurer and family ; 15 Resident Officers (of whom five were males); 17 house servants (all females); Lodge Porter and wife; and 366 inmates, of whom 185 were boys, and 181 girls. Also Laundry Staff, seven females; and Infirmary Staff, six females; and House Porter and his wife at 40, Brunswick Square, which is the Nursery, entered from the Institution grounds at the north-west angle. There are three groups of dormitories, three schools, two dining halls, and three playgrounds. The dormitories are situated—boys in the west wing, girls in the east wing, and infants in the separate nursery building, northwest of the main building. The schools are situated—the boys' school-room is at the north end of the west wing, or west end of the main building on the 70 ground floor, and is entered from the boys' staircase; the girls' school-room is at the north end of the east wing, or east end of the main building on the first floor, and is entered from off the girls' staircase by its own staircase; the mixed school-room is under the girls, but is entered by its own door directly from the north-east side of the main building. The dining hall in the west wing is used by the boys and infant boys, the dining hall in the east wing is used by the girls and the infant girls; jiart of the southern end of the girls dining room is partitioned off and is occupied during meal times by some 30 or 40 of the elder girls. The playground of the boys classes is south of the west, that of the girls south of the east wing, and that of the mixed classes north east of the main building, close to the mixed school-room. In the nursery buildings the youngest infants, boys and girls slept, the other girl infants slept in the girls' dormitories, numbered 1 and 2, mixed with girls somewhat older, and the other boy infants in the boys' dormitories, numbered 3 and 4, mixed with boys somewhat older. The infant boys dining with older boys in the boys' dining hall, and the infant girls with older girls in the girls' dining hall. The infants attended the mixed school and played together in the mixed playground. It is to be observed that in the order of increasing age the boys' dormitories run B 4, 3, 2, and 1, whereas the girls' dormitories run G 1, 2, 4, and 3, the oldest boys and girls being in the last numbered dormitories of each series. It is further to be noted that each of the respective wings B 4 and 3, and G 1 and 2, are on the first floor, and B 2 and 1, and G 4 and 3, are 011 the second floor; and also that each pair of parallel wards on each floor, in addition to communicating with the staircase at the end, have a door of communication in the middle by which nurses can move from one ward to the other without going into the staircase. It is evident that the infection entered by the mixed school and play ground and so reached the nursery and girls' dormitories G I and G 2, and boys' dormitories B 3 and B 4. The milk supply was carefully traced and examined, physically, chemically, and tacteriolgically, without any result. Besides, all milk used in the Institution is boiled before use, except about a quart which is kept specially for the use of a few senior officers, and is not consumed by any of the children.

On the 11 th October the Borough Council resolved that a system of voluntary notification of pulmonary phthisis be inaugurated in the Borough, at the sum allowed for notification under the notifiable Infectious Diseases Clauses. This,, combined with the provision made in the previous year for the Bacteriological Examination of spurtum from suspicious cases of pulmonary tuberculosis,, enabled a scheme to be framed for dealing with this disease. The following circular letter with enclosures was sent to every Medical Practitioner in St. Pancas, and within a quarter of a mile of the border of the Borough, and to the Public Institutions in St. Pancras and Special Institutions outside:— ST. PANCRAS BOROUGH COUNCIL. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Pancras Road, N.W. January Ist, 190l> Voluntary Notification of Pulmonary Phthisis or Consumption, Dear Sir, In 1903 the St. Pancras Borough Council resolved to provide for the Bacteriological Examination of Sputum in doubtful cases of pulmonary tuberculosis for the purpose of diagnosis, and in the outfit of the diagnosis box you received a form of directions as to the procedure necessary to obtain the results of a Bacteriological Examination. Recently the Borough Council resolved to adopt the voluntary notification of pulmonary phthisis at the same fee allowed for notification under the Notifiable Infectious Diseases Clauses. The patient's assent should be obtained before notifying. I beg to enclose herewith a book of Medical Certificate Forms for this purpose. A Register will be kept of all cases notified both as a record of the disease and as a matter of account. The notification will be treated as confidential, and nothing will be done to prej itdice the patient's occupation or employment. Upon the receipt of your certificate, there will be sent by post to the patient (1) a leaflet upon how to prevent the spread of consumption; (2) a list of institutions for the segration at home or elsewhere of advanced cases, and special treatment of pronounced and incipient cases; and (3) a form for the disinfection of a room previously occupied by a consumptive. I beg to enclose you herewith a copy of each of these three. i 7 Before the Council can form an opinion as to the additional measures it may be desirable to take or recommend in order to further assist in preventing the spread of consumption, it will he necessary to make some inquiry with a view to ascertaining what amount and kind of assistance a patient or a family may require to combat the disease. Beyond sending a list of Societies and Institutions by which segration may be obtained at home or elsewhere, no further action will be taken in regard to segration except by special request in writing. No disinfection will be done unless and until the form duly filled in has been received. No sanitary inspection of the premises will be made except by special request, or upon complaint made for some other reason than the presence of pulmonary tuberculosis. I shall be glad to answer any further questions upon which I may have any available information. I am, Dear Sir, Yours faithfully, John F. J. Sykes, Medical Officer of Health. ST.

Of all deaths in the United Kingdom between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-five nearly one half are due to consumption. It gives rise to a vast amount of suffering and permanent ill-health. It is calculated that in Great Britain at the present moment at least a quarter of a million persons are suffering from it. The disease is preventible. Its predisposing cause is a low state of health, or it may be induced by overcrowding; ill-ventilated, dirty, dark rooms; bad or insufficient food; intemperance; and infectious fevers, or other illnesses. Consumption is, however, contracted by taking into the system, chiefly by inhalation, the germ or microbe of the disease. This germ is contained in the dust particles of the dried spit of the consumptive, and in the minute droplets sprayed into the atmosphere by the consumptive in coughing. These germs are derived from persons suffering from consumption, or some other form of tuberculosis. They are found in vast numbers in the phlegm, spit, or expectoration of a consumptive person. In a moist state this expectoration does not infect the air, excepting by the sprayed droplets in coughing, but if allowed to dry and become dust it is exceedingly dangerous, and is then a means by which the disease is spread from person to person. The best place for a consumptive is a sanatorium. If this be impracticable he must sleep in a separate bed-room. Precautions.—It is essential for the protection of their own families, and to prevent the spread of the disease among the general public, that the following .simple precautions be taken by consumptive persons:— The consumptive person must not expectorate about the house, nor on the floor of any cab, omnibus, tram-car, railway carriage, or other conveyance. Spitting about the streets, or in any public buildings (churches, schools, theatres, railway stations, &c.), is a dangerous as well as a filthy habit. The consumptive person must not expectorate anywhere except into a spittoon kept for the purpose, and containing a little water, or into sawdust or jjeat. When out of doors, a small, wide-mouthed bottle with a well-filling cork, or a pocket spittoon, which may be obtained from any chemist, should be used. The expectoration must be washed into a drain or buried in the earth or burned. The cup or spittoon must then be kept in boiling water for ten minutes before being thoroughly cleaned. 80 When not provided with a proper spittoon, a consumptive psrson must not spit into a handkerchief, but into a piece of rag or paper, which must be burnt before the phlegm has dried. Handkerchiefs, which may have been used of necessity, should, before they dry, be boiled half an hour and then washed. Consumptive persons must not swallow their phlegm, as, by so doing, the disease may be conveyed to parts of the body not already affected. A consumptive person must not kiss, or be kissed, on the mouth. A consumptive person, when coughing, should always hold a handkerchief in front of his mouth, and avoid coughing in the direction of another person. General precautions to be observed:— All rooms occupied by consumptive persons should be as well lighted and ventilated as possible. Fresh air, light, and sunshine are most important preventives of consumption. It is not safe for a healthy person to share a bedroom with a consumptive. All utensils, such as knives, forks, spoons, cups, &c., should be reserved for his special use and carefully washed in boiling water. No chimney should ever be blocked up, and windows should be kept open night and day. Cleanliness and good sanitary surroundings are important, both for the prevention and for the cure of consumption. Instead of sweeping rooms, wet dusters must be used to wipe up the dust on the floor, furniture, woodwork, &c., and must afterwards be boiled. Tea leaves used 011 the floor should afterwards be burnt. Do not chase dust about or stir it up. Milk, especially that used for children and invalids, should be boiled or sterilised. Meat should be well cooked. A room which has been occupied by a consumptive should not be used again until it has been thoroughly disinfected. In the event of a death from consumption, advice should be sought from the local sanitary authority. ST. PANCRAS BOROUGH COUNCIL. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Pancras Road, N.W. Pulmonary Phthisis (Consumption). Societies and Institutions for Segregation. Consumption is mainly spread by the germs in the spray of the cough and the phlegm of the spit. The more the disease advances, and the more the weakness of the patient increases, the greater the difficulty of preventing the cough-spray and spit-phlegm from disseminating the disease. Hence the most advanced cases are the most likely to spread the disease, and the poorest advanced cases the least likely to be able to provide against the spread of the disease. 81 I.—Philanthropic Socif.tiks for providing separate bed-room accommodation for poor consumptives at home do not exist in England as in France, where the Benevolent Branches of the Dispensaries for the Tuberculous make such provision, but application may perhaps be made to Religious and Medical Missions, District Visiting Committees, Branches of the Charity Organisation Society, &e. II.—Homes for tiif. Last Stage of Disease (Including Consumption*). Friedenheim Hospital, Sunnyside, Upper Avenue Road, Swiss Cottage, N.W. St. Luke's House, 14, Pembridge Square, Bayswater, W. The Hostel of God, 29, North Side, Clapham Common, S.W. St. Peter's Home (Women only), Mortimer Road, Ivilburn, N.W. III.—Homes for Advanced Consumptives. For the destitute, the Poor Law Guardians of St. Pancras have provided Wards for consumptives at the Northern Infirmary, Dartmouth Park Hill, N.W. For the necessitous, the Metropolitan Asylums Board have had under consideration on several occasions the question of providing accommodation for consumptives, and the matter is still under consideration. For the provident, the National Committee for the establishment of Sanatoria for workers suffering from Tuberculosis (54, Gray's Inn Road, W.C., Secretary, W. G. Bunn), proposes to construct sanatoria to be maintained by the combined efforts of Trade Unions and other labour organisations. For the impecunious who are able to secure the interest of subscribers or guarantors, and also for paying patients, the following Institutions are available :— Home for Consumptive Females, 57 & 58, Gloucester Place, Portman Square, W. 26 beds. Admission, £1 Is. entrance fee and 7s. a week for chronic cases, and 10s. a week (without entrance fee) for cases awaiting admission to a consumptive hospital. Hospital of St. John and St. Elizabeth, 40, Grove End Road, St. John's Wood, N.W. 85 beds. Admission by Subscriber's letter. Women only are admitted at present. A special ward for consumption. St. Joseph's Hospital for Incurable Women and Children, Burlington Lane, Chiswick, W. 40 beds. Admission, 10s. 6d. weekly for women, and 5s. 6d. weekly for children. £2 2s. to £4 4s. weekly for a separate room. At Yentnor, St. Catherine's Home for Advanced Consumptives. At Bournemouth, Fir's Home for Advanced Consumptives. At Torquay, Mildmay Home for Advanced Consumptives. IV.—Special Hospital for Pronounced Consumptives. All the special Institutions mentioned below admit pronounced cases by letter of recommendation. The period of treatment of pronounced cases is limited, but patients are instructed and trained to so manage themselves as to avoid danger to others when they leave the Institution. 82 Mount Vernon Hospital for Consumption, Mount Vernon, Hampstead,. N.W., and Northwood, Middlesex. 110 beds. Office and out-patients, 7, Fitzroy Square, W. Brorapton Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest, Brompfon,. S.W. 321 beds. Royal Hospital for Diseases of the Chest, City Road, E.C. 80 beds. City of London Hospital for Diseases of the Chest, Victoria Park, E. 164 beds. [General Hospitals are more and more inclined not to admit patients suffering from consumption on account of the length of time they may require to occupy the hospital beds.] V.—Sanatoriums for Incipient Consumptives. The National Association for the prevention of Consumption and other forms of Tuberculosis publish a List of Sanatoria at their Central Office, 20, Hanover Square, W. (6d.). More or less complete lists to date are also published in the Medical Directory and other medical publications. The Sanatoria are too numerous to print here; they attract cases in the earliest stage before the expectoration of infective sputum has comnunced or is fully established, and their object is to cure. VI.—Opex-Aik Occupation for Consumptives. There is at present no Special Society for finding or providing open-air employment for Consumptives on leaving Sanatoriums, Hospitals, or Homes,, or to work in conjunction with a Society for providing separate bed-rooms at home for poor Consumptives.

Here follows a Reprint of Sect. 45, Sheffield Corporation Act, 1903. Provisions for notification of Tuberculosis of the Lung. (1). (a) Every registered medical practitioner attending on or called in to visit any person within the City shall forthwith on becoming aware that such person is suffering from Tuberculosis of the Lung send to the Medical Officer of Health a certificate on a form to be supplied to him gratuitously by the Corporation stating the name age sex and place of residence and employment or occupation (so far as can be reasonably ascertained) of the person so suffering and whether the case occurs in his private practice or in his practice as medical officer of any hospital public body friendly or other society or institution. (b) Any such medical practitioner who fails to give such certificate shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding forty shillings. (c) The Corporation shall pay to every such medical practitioner for each certificate dulv sent by him in accordance with this section a fee of two shillings and sixpence if the case occurs in his private practice and of one shilling if the case occurs in his practice as medical officer of any hospital public body friendly or other society or institution. 86 (d) A payment made to any medical practitioner in pursuance of this section shall not disqualify that practitioner from serving as a member of the Corporation or as a Guardian of a Union situate wholly or partly in the City or in any municipal or parochial office (2). (a) Where the .Medical Officer of Health certifies that the cleansing and disinfecting of any building (including in that term any ship, vessel, boat, tent, shed, or similar structure used for human habitation) would tend to prevent or check Tuberculosis of the Lung the Town Clerk shall give notice in writing to the owner or occupier of such building that the same or any part thereof will be cleansed and disinfected by the Corporation at the cost of the Corporation unless the owner or occupier of such building informs the Corporation within 21 hours from the receipt of the notice that he will cleanse and disinfect the building or the part thereof to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health within the time to be fixed in the notice. If within 24 hours from the receipt of such notice the owner or occupier of such building has not informed the Corporation as aforesaid or if having so informed the Corporation he fails to have the building or the part thereof disinfected as aforesaid within the time fixed by the notice the building or the part thereof shall be cleansed and disinfected by the officers and at the cost of the Corporation under the superintendence of the Medical Officer of Health. Provided that any such budding or part thereof may without any such notice being given as aforesaid but with the consent of the owner or occupier be cleansed and disinfected by the officers of and at the cost of the Corporation under the superintendence of the Medical Officer of Health.

(9). The lerm "Medical Officer of Health," in this section shall mean the Medical Officer of Health for the time being of the City or any person duly authorised to act temporarily as Medical Officer of Health for the City. tuberculosis and laundry workers. Professor L. Landouzy has examined 1,590 laundry employes treated at the Laennec Hospital, this class forming fully 6 per cent, of the 23, '49 inmates of the hospital between 1900 and 1904 (Presse Mcdica/c, Nos. 79-80, Oct. 4-(i). More than a third of the 1,202 women and more than a half of the 388 men were affected with pulmonary tuberculosis, generally of the acute form. Surgical tuberculous lesions were rare among them. Laundry employes, as a rule, are young and strong, but they become infected from breathing the dried sputa from handkerchiefs, napkins, and bed linen. .All these articles arc sorted out, pell-mell, and the employes live and breathe in an atmosphere full of bacillus dust. This professional tuberculosis of laundry workers may entail endemic tuberculosis. Sanitary certificates should be insisted on for every house, and they should state the profession of its inmates or late residents. If they include a laundry worker, the house should be mistrusted until disinfected. Tuberculosis among laundry workers is avoidable, and education of the public will certainly reduce its proportions. When the fear of contagion is once implanted, protective measures will become mere ordinary reHex actions. The task of educating the public belongs to physicians. They must make families understand that they have duties to perform, and chief among them is the obligation to render harmless the virulent expectorated matters, and to take care •of soiled linen differently from the present customs. Laundry workers should be protected by sanitary regu a ions, enforced by public authority if need be.— >(Public Health, December, 1905, p. 163.) KX On the 17th December, 1902, tlie Borough Council approved and adopted the following recommendation—"That in laundries, the examining, sorting or marking of dirty linen he prohibited under the Factory and Workshops Acts, until after it has been effectually disinfected by boiling and washing in strong soap and water, or by some other equally effectual means." This course was found necessary on account of the frequency with which laundry workers becamc infected with small-pox from persons who were suffering from unrecognised, mild, and apparently undisturbing attacks of the disease, especially those who had been vaccinated in infancy. It is already a punishable offence to transmit infected clothing to laundries, but the difficulty is to know when it is infected. It is by the missed, unrecognised, and undiagnosed cases that infectious disease is mostly spread, and the only way in which the infected linen of such cases can be rendered harmless is by the method approved by the Borough Council. MEASLES. In March, 190G, the London County Council adopted the undermentioned regulations for the exclusion from school of children suffering from measles, or coining from houses where measles exists, this procedure superseding the existing regulation Sub-section V. of ISection C. of Article III. of the School o O Management Code :— Children suffering from measles must be excluded for at least one month. Children coming from houses where measles exists, but who are not themselves suffering from the disease should be dealt with as follows:— (i.) A child attending other than an infants' school who has had measles need not be excluded from attendance at school. (ii.) A child attending other than an infants' school who has not had measles must be excluded from attendance at school until the Monday following the expiration of 14 days from the occurrence of the first case. (iii.) A child attending an infants' school, whether or not it lias had measles, must be excluded from attendance at school until the Monday following the expiration of 14 days from the occurrence of the last case." cerejbro-spinal fever. The Local Government Board, on 24t'n August, 1905, addressed a circular letter to Sanitary Authorities with reference to this disease, in which it is. stated that, so far as they have been able to ascertain, there is no ground for apprehension that the disease may have newly extended to this country; it having recently been somewhat extensively prevalent in Central Europe and in America. Nevertheless they consider that Sanitary Authorities should be on the alert to detect the presence of the disease in their districts, and the Board have issued a memorandum, prepared by their Medical Officer, dealing with the characteristic symptoms of the disease. The Board describe the steps it would be desirable to take in the event of the discovery in any district of cases of illness which might possibly be of the nature of cerebro-spinal fever, and state that in such an event they would be prepared to render the Sanitary Authority such advice or assistance as might appear to be necessary, and in the event of the Sanitary Authority desiring that the disease should be made compulsorilv notifiable in their district, the Board would be prepared to consider an application for their approval to a resolution o! the Authority for a temporary extension of the provisions of law to the disease. 89 GLANDERS IN LONDON AMONGST HORSES.

DISINFECTION OF ROOMS. Infected rooms are sprayed and fumigated in the following manner:— (1) All openings are closed and sealed. (2) The surfaces are sprayed with a 2 per cent, solution of formaldehyde (made by mixing 6 ounces of 40 per cent, solution of fomalin with one gallon of water). (3) With the surfaces wet and the air of the room saturated with moisture, sulphur cakes (1 lb. per 1,000 cubic feet of air space) are burnt for fumigation. The fresh sulphurous acid gas is produced in an atmosphere saturated with moisture and allowed to act for about four hours. Sulphurous acid is a heavy, slowly diffusible gas fitted to act slowly over a prolonged period. Formaldehyde is a light, rapidly diffusible gas, best applied in solution. THE STEAM DISINFECTING CHAMBERS. Mode of Piocedure. The manner in which a high-pressure disinfecting chamber is to be used when it has been charged with infected articles is as follows: — 93 The chamber having been charged the door is then closed, the valve admitting steam into the chamber is opened, and the valve to the outlet pipe is also opened; the door is then clamped up, and, as this occupies about five minutes, the incoming steam in the meantime will have driven all the air out of the chamber through the outlet pipe. The valve to the outlet pipe is then closed and the steam allowed to accumulate under pressure in the chamber until a pressure of 20 lbs. to the square inch is reached and recorded on the automatic register. This will occupy about ten minutes, and when a pressure of 20 lbs. is recorded the outlet valve is opened, and the excess steam allowed to flow out, and the pressure to drop to zero. This intermittence is of extreme importance, as it is only after the intermittence that the utmost penetration into bulky articles is obtained. The valve to the outlet pipe is then closed and the steam again allowed to accumulate under pressure in the chamber until a pressure of 20 lbs. is again reached and recorded on the automatic register. At this point the centre of beds, pillows, &c., will be penetrated and raised to the boiling temperature 212° F. This second accumulation will occupy about ten minutes, and when the 20 lbs. pressure has been again recorded the outlet valve is opened, the excess steam allowed to flow out, and the pressure again allow to drop to zero. The process of steam disinfection is now complete, but the chamber will still be full of steam. In order to prevent condensation to get rid of the inconvenient steam, the steam inlet valve is turned off, and the steam exhaust valve is turned on, and at the same time the hot air inlet valve is also turned on and a current of hot air allowed to flow through the chamber for five minutes when the doors may be opened in comparative comfort. In tabular form the following is briefly the process:— Current steam = 5 minutes. Close outlet. High-pressure steam to 20 lbs. = 10 minutes. Exhaust. High-pressure steam to 20 lbs. = 10 minutes. Exhaust. Current hot air = 5 minutes. DISINFECTANT FOR MIDWIVES' HANDS. Half an ounce of corrosive sublimate to be dissolved in one fluid ounce of hydrochloric acid, and five grains of aniline blue to be dissolved in one ounce of wood naphtha, the two mixed together and made up to twelve ounces by the addition of water. To be kept in a twelve-ounce blue fluted poison bottle, labelled poison, with a patent poison cork, and to be carefully guarded and placed above the reach of children. A twelfth part to be mixed with every quart of water to make the disinfectant. It should not be further diluted, and must be kept and poured only into wooden, earthenware, or glass vessels, and not be brought into contact with metals. 94 § 5.

At the commencement of the year, in accordance with the recommendations of the Re-organisation Committee, the Inspector of Workshops (men) and the three Inspectors of Tenement Houses were made District Inspectors, and each allotted one-half of Wards 1, 5, 7, and 8, and all the District Inspectors were instructed to include amongst their duties the inspection of registered tenement houses, and workshops and factories where men are employed. Notice was given to owners, builders, and others that the Sanitary Inspectors can be interviewed at the Town Hall only between 9 and 9.30 a.m., and instruction was given to the Inspectors to complete their office work and leave the Town Hall not later than 10 a.m. The temporary clerk, Mr. John 0. Ogden, who had been employed during the previous five years in keeping the registers relating to smoke nuisances, factories, workshops, bakehouses, restaurant kitchens, tenement houses, inscribed dwellings, underground dwellings, etc., was in October appointed on the permanent staff. Indexes.—In the past it was often found a difficult, tedious, and prolonged labour to obtain the history of any individual house or premises. It was recognised that it was first of all necessary to have all returns and records, 102 and every register indexed. For a number of years past the existing registers have been indexed, and the registers of additional classes of premises dealt with, and for which new registers have been formed from time to time have also been indexed, and more recently the returns received by the Department have also been indexed. As these indexes are all on one basis, namely, according to streets and premises, it now becomes possible to construct a Master Index should it at any time be considered that the labour involved in such a compilation would be commensurate with its utility for reference. For instance, there are now annual indexes of the returns of births, of the returns of deaths under one year of age, of the returns of deaths at all ages ; indexes of the registers of infectious diseases notified, of the complaints made, of the notices served, of the drainage works executed, and of course of all registered and listed premises. Special Inspector's Report.—The following is the Report of the Special Inspector:— To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to submit my Report for the year, 1905. Small Pox.—I investigated the only two cases of small pox notified during the year. The infected rooms were fumigated and sprayed by the disinfectors, and the surfaces were stripped and cleansed by the Works Department. Infectious Disease Contact Shelter.—43 persons came to the shelter, received a warm bath, and had their clothing steamed As the disinfection of premises has been expedited by substituting spraying for stripping the walls of infected rooms, it was not necessary for the shelter to be used during the night. Disinfection.—1,092 rooms were sprayed and fumigated during the year. The process of fumigating and spraying the surfaces of infected rooms has been found to answer satisfactorily. 39,180 articles were steamed in addition to the wearing apparel of verminous persons and infectious disease contacts. 7,403 articles were fumigated in the specially constructed chamber, which could not be treated with steam without damage or destruction. 367 articles were destroyed by fire with the owners' consent. The work at the disinfecting station is gradually increasing ; in addition to steaming the articles infected by patients suffering from the various notifiable diseases, the wearing apparel of infectious disease contacts, and verminous persons attending the baths, the verminous articles from infested rooms and articles from rooms in which non-notifiable cases of infectious diseases occur are also steamed, which is an additional tax on the machines. Personal Cleansing Station.—3,401 persons attended during the year and received a warm bath; while in the bath the wearing apparel was steamed. A number of persons, mostly men, have attended at the station more than once: although an offer is made to remove the bedding from the dwelling of each person the offer is practically never acceptcd. 103 Railway Nuisances.—I inspected the sanitary conveniences at all the railway stations in the Borough used by the male public. I did not discover any nuisances without testing the drains or soil pipes. Some of the companies let these conveniences out by contract, while others have their own employees as attendants. I also made a number of observations of locomotives at the sidings of the Railway Companies with a view of suppressing the smoke nuisance. Foreign Arrivals.—I also visited the contacts notified by the Port Sanitary Authorities, who had been in contact with infectious disease abroad or on board ship, or had arrived from an infected area. I experienced some difficulty at times in finding the persons, as very frequently a wrong or false address was given in another Ward or Sub-Division of the Borough or elsewhere. Offensive Trade Premises.—I made 35 visits to these premises. During the hot weather complaints were received of the smell from the vans calling at one of these premises, and the proprietor speedily made permanent arrangements to have the melting done in the country during the summer months. Fried Fish Places,—I visited all the fried fish places and rag and bone stores quarterly, and served notices where necessary to abate nuisances. The power of the Local Authority over the management of these businesses is limited owing to the absence of by-laws or regulations. I am, yours obediently, W. Gr. Auger. 104 § 2. OPEN SPACES AND ATMOSPHERE. Public Open Spaces.—The parks, gardens, and other open spaces secured against building operations in and adjoining St. Pancras, together with their situation, approximate area, and the authority under which they are maintained, are enumerated in the following table:— Sub-Districts.

The Crescent, Euston Street, is owned by the London and North Western Railway Company. The enclosed Gardens adjoining Regent's Park Terrace and Maitland Park Villas, are owned by adjoining owners of land, and are maintained by them. ATMOSPHERE. The following paragraph from last year's report may again be quoted with advantage :— It is to be observed that in their effect upon the atmosphere and the population the two classes of open spaces produce opposite results. The open spaces planted with herbage, flowering plants, shrubs, and trees purify and cleanse the atmosphere, and afford the means of recreating and recruiting the health of the people surrounding them, and the only noises heard within them are the sounds of children's voices. The open spaces devoted to railway purposes are bare of vegetation and from them proceed the smoke of railway engines, the clanking of shunting trucks, the rumbling of trains, the vibration of heavy moving weights, the explosions of fog signals, shrill whistlings, and other disturbances of matter immensely conducive to the activities of the nation, but not to the health of the people immediately surrounding In addition they form large enclosed areas inaccessible to the public, and obstructive to local traffic, transit, and inter-communication. What contribution outside the Parliamentary Acts of the Railway Companies does the nation make towards the health and wellbeing of the local community subjected to these ills, for the nation's welfare ? Smoke.—In the Annual Report for 1902 the enactments dealing with smoke were set out in full. There are 221 smoke shafts on the Register, 661 observations of these were taken, and 78 re-inspections were made after notices served. These observations or inspections and re-inspections occupy a considerable amount of time, as the intervals between stoking are of considerable duration—at least twenty minutes. Effluvia.—Of various businesses or places producing effluvia or offensive emanations there are 100 on the Registers, and of these 313 inspections and 77 re-inspections were made. (See also under the head of Nuisances § 9.) § 3 DWELLINGS. House-to-Souse Inquiries and Inspections.—(i.) For the purpose of ascertaining the mode of sub-letting, 306 inquiries and 87 re-visits were made as to the occupation of houses in tenemented streets. (ii.) When the mode of sub-letting appears to be such as to necessitate periodical supervision of the sanitary condition of a house a complete enquiry is made into the mode of occupation of each room of the house, (iii.) When it has been decided to register a tenement house each room is measured as to its dimensions and capacity and recorded in the Register. The forms in which the reports as to these matters are made, were quoted in the Annual Report for 1904. 108 (b) Tenement Houses.—During the year, 245 inspections and 21 re-inspections were made for the purpose of measuring tenement or lodging-houses which it had been decided to register, and at the end of the year 2,192 houses were upon the register. Of these houses, 2,947 periodical half-yearly inspections were made, and 5,637 re-inspections after the service of notices. Also of the 219 dwellings entered in the register of Inscribed Dwellings 295 inspections were made, and 679 re-inspections after the service of notices. The following is the record relating to registered tenement houses :— On Register atend of 1904 2,000 Registered during 1905 205 Total 2,205 Ceased to be tenement houses 1905 13 On Register at end of 1905 2,192 (c) Underground Dwellings.—At the end of the year there was on the Register 539 underground rooms which had been illegally occupied as dwellings, and had been ordered to be closed, and of which 188 inspections had been made, and 101 re-inspections after notices served. Time is allowed to the occupants of these rooms to find rooms elsewhere, and during the time allowed the illegally occupied rooms are kept under observation, and the number vacated or otherwise occupied ascertained and reported. The houses in which these dwellings are found are added to the register of registered tenement houses. (d) Common Lodging Houses.—There are 25 Registered Common Lodging Houses in St. Pancras, and these are supervised by the London County Council, including the one Salvation Army Shelter in South St. Pancras. Rowton Houses are not so registered; of these there are in St. Pancras one at the southern end of King's Cross Road in South St. Pancras, and another at the northern end of Arlington Road in West St. Pancras. (e) Canal Boat Dwellings.—During the year 125 visits of inspection were paid to the 31 wharves on the Regent's Canal. (f) Working-Class Flats.—A list of the principal of these and the accommodation provided will be found in the Appendix to this Report. Goldington Buildings, the working class flats erected by the Borough Council on the vacant site at the south end of Great College Street, N.W., adjoining the Royal Veterinary College, and opposite the Town Hall, were completed and opened in June, 1904. The area of the site is 15,576 superficial feet. The area covered by building is 6,949 superficial feet, and the cubic capacity of the buildings is 405,123 cubic feet. A portion of the site is laid out as an open court yard, having an area of 8,527 superficial feet. The building is horse shoe in shape, and has a frontage length of 311½ feet. The buildings consist of 5 blocks, of which 4 contain 12 dwellings each, and the remaining block 8 dwellings, making a total of 56 dwellings, with 166 rooms. The number of persons that can be housed is 332 (which is ten more than required by the Order). The contract for the building was £17,778 l1s. 5d., the cost per room £107 2s., and the cost per cubic foot 10½d. The domestic 109 and sanitary conveniences provided are—scullery and copper, open balcony, coal-bin and dust-bin, and w.c. Electric light is laid on and cupboards are provided. The rooms of the dwellings are through ventilated, and there is no possible air communication between one dwelling and another, or between a w.c. and a dwelling. The large courtyard contains a covered playing place for children, and the vista through the gateway towards the trees of Goldington Crescent with the granite fountain in the centre is particularly pleasing. Revenue Art, 1903.—The requirements under this Act were set out in the Annual Report for 1904. The following is an interesting extract from the Annual Report for 1904 of the Health Officer of Shanghai (page 7) :— In some respects the construction of dwellings cannot bo regulated by building rules, and such is the case with regard to the arrangement of kitchens, Bowel disorders are the only ones in Shanghai to be specially feared by the foreign resident, and are probably in every case derived from infected food. It becomes necessary, therefore, for the careful housewife to jealously guard the preparation of food. Simple rules will be found in the Public Health Notice which is obtainable on application at the Health Office, 1, Honan Road. As regards house construction three separate rooms should, if possible, be provided for the preparation of food :— The larder, kept strictly for storing uncooked food from the local market. It should have a north window fitted with fine wire gauze and a door opening into the open air and not into the hot kitchen. The kitchen with kitchen sink, &c. The serving-room, communicating with the dining-room, and containing the Berkefeld filter, ice-chest, the table utensils and washing up sink. Here should be stored all drinks, boiled milk, bread and butter, cooked and prepared foods and such fresh fruits and vegetables as can be safely eaten. The main point is to keep everything that goes on the table quite separate from the uncooked food that comes from the market. Cooking or boiling destroy infection.

Somers Town. 1 (a).— Churchway Scheme.—In continuation of the previous Annual Reports on this subject, the houses Nos. 146, 148, and 150, Euston Road having been acquired, have been demolished, and now (1906) the new roadway of Churchway has been continued into Euston Road, so that an ample thoroughfare by the side of the New Hospital for Women leads past Wellesley, Somerset, and Seymour Buildings into the heart of the area between Seymour Street and Chalton Street, and opens out into Euston Road the culs-de-sac formed by Drunnnond Crescent, Drummond Street (East End), Lancing Street, and Grafton Place, which formerly could only be entered from Seymour Street, and into which street they again led. 110 Part- II. Area No. 1, Somers Town—continued. 1 (b).—Part of area west of Chalton Street and north of Drmnmond Street line.—The houses in this area were dealt with individually under the Public Health Act some years ago. 1 (c).—Part of area taut of Chalton Street.—In continuation of the history of the Chapel Grove and Eastnor Place Improvement Schemes. The schemes of 1898, amended in 1901, relating to these two areas were embodied in one order by the Local Government Board, and a notice thereof published in the " London Gazette," and the owners of every part of the area were served with notices thereof. The Midland Railway Company having acquired the land, petitioned against the order in December, 1905, as did also a leaseholder, and the order of the Local Government Board sanctioning the schemes has become "provisional." Areas No. 2 and 3. Prospect Terrace and Brantome Place Order.—The position with regard to the three sites embraced in this Order is as follows :— (a) Great College Street Site. — On this additional vacant site included in the Order of the Local Government Board for the purpose of housing part of the persons to be displaced from the Brantome Place and Prospect Terrace areas, Goldington Buildings were erected, and are fully occupied. These buildings have been described under the head of (f) Working Class Flats, and accommodate 332 persons, or 10 more than required by the Order. (b) Brantome Place Area.—All the interests on the area have been acquired, an agreement has been come to with the Skinners Company on behalf of the Trustees of Tollbridge School, and the buildings on the area have been demolished. (c) Prospect Terrace Area.—Negotiations have still been proceeding for the acquisition of the roadway from the Rectors of St. George-theMartyr and St. George's, Bloomsbury, and arbitration as to purchase has been withdrawn. In the Order the number of persons to be displaced from these two areas is 1,165, and the number to be re-housed on the three sites is 842 persons. lll HOUSING OF THE WORIKING CLASSES ACT, 1890, PART II., SINGLE HOUSES.

In the case of individual houses efforts are made to exhaust the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to remedy defects, before resorting to the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, except when it is obvious that no remedy short of demolition and reconstruction is available. § 4.—SCHOOLS. At the 66 grant-receiving schools 48 inspections were made during the year by the Woman Inspector. The Board of Education decided to relieve Local Authorities from the obligation to provide school places for children under the age of five years, the age at which compulsory school attendance begins, and many Authorities are ceasing to admit to school children from 3-5 years of age. § 5.—FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS Factories.—The Men Inspectors had 341 and the Woman Inspector 101 factories upon the Registers for periodical inspection as to water service, sanitary conveniences, drainage, and nuisances. During the year 18 and 94 inspections of factories, respectively, were made, and 37 re-inspections after notices served. Workshops.—The Men Inspectors had 802 (apart from bakehouses) and the Woman Inspector 385 workshops oh the Registers for periodical inspection. During the year 595 and 241 inspections, respectively, of these premises were made, and 498 and 18 re-inspections after notices. 112 Workplaces.— These include restaurant kitchens, cab and omnibus yards, laundries and domestic workshops, and home workplaces. Domestic Workshops and Home Workplaces.— The Woman Inspector has 226 of these on the Register, of which 223 inspections and 1 re-inspection after notice were made. These places vary in number from year to year, and according to the season of the year. Laundries.— On the Register are 90 laundries at which the Woman Inspector made 104 inspections and 17 re-inspections. Restaurant Kitchens.— Of these the Men Inspectors had 63 and the Woman Inspector 157 on the Registers. At the former 96 inspections and 118 reinspections were made, and at the latter 68 inspections and 2 re-inspections. Bakehouses.— At the commencement of the year there were 178 workshopbakehouses. Of these and of the three factory bakehouses, and the three bakehouses in hotels, 298 inspections and 345 re-inspections were made. This large number of re-inspections was part of the work in connection with certifying underground bakehouses. Sanitary Conveniences in Factories and Workshops.— Under § 7, Drainage, will be found a note upon the structural requirements of sanitary conveniences in factories and workshops. Home Work.—The following circular letter was sent to the occupiers of all factories, workshops, and workplaces in St. Pancras :— METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ST. PANCRAS. Public Health Department. Town Hall, Pancras Road, N.W. To Sir, Home Work.

(2) This section shall apply in the case of the occupier of any place from which any work is given out as if that place were a workshop. 109.—If the occupier of a factory or workshop or of any place from which any work is given out, or any contractor employed by any such occupier, causes or allows wearing apparel to be made, cleaned, or repaired, in any dwelling house or building occupied therewith, whilst any inmate of the dwelling house is suffering from scarlet fever or small-pox, then, unless he proves he was not aware of the existence of the illness in the dwelling house and could not reasonably have been expected to become aware of it. he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding ten pounds. 110.—(1) If any inmate of a house is suffering from an infectious disease to which this section applies, the District Council of the district in which the house is situate may make an order forbidding any work to which this section applies to be given out to any person living or working in that house, or such part thereof as may be specified in the order, and any order so made may be served on the occupier of any factory or workshop or any other place from which work is given out, or on the contractor employed by any such occupier. (2) The order may be made notwithstanding that the person suffering from an infectious disease may have been removed from the house, and the order shall be made either for a specified time or subject to the condition that the house or part thereof liable to be infected shall be disinfected to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health, or that other reasonable precautions shall be adopted.

The Home Secretary on the 4th February, 1903, issued No. 89 of his Statutory Rides and Orders, which is a Sanitary Accommodation Order, and amongst other things it provides that " every " sanitary convenience shall be kept in a cleanly state, shall be sufficiently " ventilated and lighted, and shall not communicate with any workroom except " through the open air, or through an intervening ventilated space ; provided " that any workrooms in use prior to the 1st January, 1903, and mechanically " ventilated in such a manner that air cannot be drawn into the workroom " through the sanitary convenience, an intervening ventilating space shall not " be required." Unfortunately, as beforementioned, the Act provides that this < Irder shall not apply to London, and consequently London has to fall back upon By-law (.1) of the London County Council, made under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 39 (1), with respect to water-closets, in which it is prohibited to " construct any such water-closet, so that it is approached " directly through any room used for the purpose! of human habitation, or used " for the manufacture, preparation, or storage of food of man, or used as a " factory, workshop, or workplace." Now, it has been held by a magistrate that a water-closet approached through two doors and a narrow intervening space is not approached directly. It is very desirable that the London County Council By-law should be amended so as to embrace the principle expressed in the Order of the Home Secretary, namely, the severance of a water-closet from an occupied place by an intervening ventilated space or lobby. Water-closels in basements.—By the same London County Council By-law it is provided that a water-closet in a basement shall have an area of forty square feet of open space at least five feet in width. Presumably this provision is for the purpose of aerially disconnecting the water-closet from the interior of the building. It is difficult to understand why such a large amount of open space is required in this instance, whilst none at all is required in the instance quoted above. Materials of pipes.— Paragraph 12 of By-law No. 4 of the Drainage By-laws made by the London County Council under the Metropolis Management Act, 18-35, Section 202, runs as follows :— " Provided that in any case where such drain shall be constructed of " iron, he shall not be required to cover such drain with concrete, " but unless it be carried above-ground and also be carried at least " at each joint on adequate piers or other sufficient supports, con" structed of iron, stone, brick, or cement concrete, it shall be laid " on a bed of good concrete in accordance with the requirements " of this By-law relating to drains which do not pass under a " building." And By-law 11, paragraph 1, runs as follows :— " Any person who shall provide a soil pipe in connection with a new " building for the purpose of conveying to a sewer any solid or " liquid excremental filth, or shall for that purpose construct a soil " pipe in connection with an existing building, shall, whenever 125 "practicable, cause such soil pipe to be situated outside such "building, and shall construct such soil pipe in drawn lead or of "heavy cast iron. Provided that in any case where it shall be "necessary to construct such soil pipe within such building, he "shall construct such soil pipe in drawn lead with proper wiped "plumber's joints, and so as to be easily accessible." It will be observed that the first-quoted By-law applies to a horizontal pipe carrying soil, and the second to a vertical pipe carrying soil; that the former may be constructed of iron and left naked inside a building, whereas the latter must be constructed of lead. Also by By-law 8 (v) a fresh-air inlet pipe inside a building must be constructed of drawn lead as if it were a soil pipe. It is difficult to convince builders, agents, and owners of the necessitv for constructing within a building a vertical pipe carrying soil of a different material from a horizontal pipe carrying soil or fresh air. Sizes of pipes.—Under the same Drainage By-laws it is required by By-law 8 (4) that a ventilating pipe of a soil pipe or drain shall have an internal diameter of not less than 4 inches, whereas by By-law 11, paragraph 2, the minimum size of a soil pipe may be 3i- inches, and by By-law 4, paragraphs 9 and 10, the minimum size a drain pipe may be 3 inches, so that Sanitary Inspectors are obliged to compel builders to put 4 inch ventilating pipes to 3J inch soil pipes and 3 inch drain pipes. § 8. STORAGE AND REMOVAL OF OFFENSIVE MATTERS. Rag and Bone Stores or Marine Stores.—Premises used for these purposes require regulating, and some of the regulations desirable to be made should follow on these lines:— Any place used to store bones, fat, rags, &c., should be so ventilated and so cut off from any dwelling place that no aerial connection may take place between the store and the dwelling. In such a place the utensils and floor and lower part of the walls should be cleansed at least every week, the upper part of the walls and the ceiling of roof every year. All animal matters should be removed at least once a week. They should be stored in air-tight receptacles made of metal, and be removed in the same airtight receptacles as they are stored in, and not be changed from one receptacle to another. Discarded textile substances, such as rags, paper, matting, and similar substances, if infested with vermin, should be disinfested, removed or destroyed. Discarded textile substances should not be stored in a place that is damp or exposed to rain or wet, or liable to bo heated. No substances whatever should be allowed to accumulate upon the premises of a marine store to such an extent as to block out the light and air of the premises, or of any adjoining premises, or to cause any noxious odour, or effluvia, or nuisance to any occupier of the premises or of any adjoining premises. 126 § 9.—NUISANCES, NOTICES, &c. Regent's Canal Water.—Specimens of water, taken from various parts of the Regent's Canal within the Borough, were sent for analysis to Sir Thomas Stevenson. The general tenor of his reports upon these specimens of water was that the water was sewege polluted, but that the contamination was not such as to cause a nuisance. § 10.—SUMMONSES.

Bakehouses, restaurant kitchens, and similar workplaces fall under the Factory and Workshop Acts, and have been dealt with under Part IV. § 2. UNWHOLESOME FOOD. Dirty Milk.—On the 20th February a churn of milk was seized at Euston Station as unfit for human food. The churn was consigned from Easton Mandit, Northamptonshire, to a large London dairy company, and was labelled "warranted pure new milk with all its cream and free from preservative." Upon examination there was seen on the surface of the milk a quantity of floating foreign matter, straws, little lumps of brownish matter like cow dung, hairs, and numerous black particles, giving all the appearances of an impure and very dirty milk, unfit for human food. The magistrate at Marylebone Police Court made an order for its destruction. Before pouring it away 128 samples were taken from the top and, from the bottom of the milk in the churn, and were submitted to bacteriological examination. This examination showed in the top samples the presence of pus cells, granular debris, and various kind of micro-organisms, the deposit consisted principally of f œcal material, granular debris, epithelial cells, and pus, and subsequently a guineapig inoculated with the material developed tuberculosis. The Council decided to prosecute, and the case was heard at Marylebone Police Court on April 7, and at the adjourned hearing, at the Tower Bridge Police Court on May 12, the defendant, John Roberts, was fined £25 and £5 5s. costs. Seizure of Unsound Food.—By Section 47 (8) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, a person in possession of unsound food is expected to give written notice to the Sanitary Authority to remove it as trade refuse. To permit a person neglecting to do this to prevent the officer of the authority from seizing the food by offering to "surrender" it is a form of procedure unrecognised by the Act and calculated to defeat it, since the officer by not seizing the food renders it impossible for the authority to prosecute should they consider it necessary in the interests of the public, and so the Act might be rendered inoperative. Whether the possessor of the unsound food or the person who sold it to him should be the one to be prosecuted, if a prosecution be decided upon, is a question for the legal advisor of the authority. The essential point is that an inspector having discovered unsound food intended for human consumption it is his duty to seize it and not to forgo seizure because the possessor says " Now you have discovered it I will 'surrender' it!" This would be reducing the provisions of the Act to a game of hide and seek for grown up children. Domestic Contamination of Food.—In Part IV., Sanitation, under § 3, Dwellings, sub-head (f) "Working Class Flats, and the paragraph relating to the Revenue Act of 1903, an interesting quotation has been made as to the construction and management of larder, kitchen, and serving-room in regard to the prevention of the domestic contamination of food, and the importance of keeping uncooked and cooked food in separate places, as cooking sterilises food. Contamination of Milk Luring Delivery.—A complaint was made that milk cans were seen by the police to be washed in a horse trough, and Inspector Auger reported that he saw some milk cans left at the side of a street and a dog paying them most objectionable attention. The only remedy for this is the delivery of milk in bottle. Pollution of Milk in Railway Transit.—The following is an extract from the Annual Report for the year 1904 of the Intelligence Division of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries:—"Numerous complaints have been received by the Board with regard to the insanitary condition of vans furnished by railway companies for the carriage of milk. The majority of these were made by the Central Association of Dairy Farmers, which has 16 affiliated agricultural bodies interested in milk traffic. Nine specific complaints were inquired into by the Board, and the condition of milk vans generally on various railways investigated. The information obtained tended to show that there was a foundation for the complaints in the fact that fish, or other articles liable to taint milk, if not actually loaded with the churns, were frequently carried in vans subsequently used for milk traffic. The question of insanitary vans for milk was one 129 of the subjects touched on by the Board in their recent correspondence with the Railway Clearing House, who stated that every reasonable precaution was taken by railway companies to ensure milk being sent in sanitary vans. They also intimated that fresh instructions had been issued on the subject. Two cases of milk being conveyed under insanitary conditions have been brought under the notice of the companies by the Board. In one instance an Inspector of the Board noticed milk being loaded in the same van with fish. In the other a statement was made by an agricultural correspondent that milk vans on a certain route frequently contained or smelt of fish. This was subsequently inquired into and verified by one of the Board's Inspectors." The following is an extract from "Public Health," of October, 1905:— Railway Rites and the Milk Traffic. To the Editor of "Public Health." Sir, In view of the interest which is being taken in the supply of pure milk, it may be of interest to your readers if you will allow us to show, by our experience, how we were prevented from carrying out part of a scheme by the excessive charges of the railway companies. We desired to obtain milk, bottle and pasteurize it, in the country near the source of its collection. We accordingly approached the Great Western Pailway Company in December, 1897. After several interviews with the head of the Goods Traffic Department, at Paddington Station, the best quotation that we could obtain for carrying our milk in this manner was 6d. per ton per mile for full bottles and cases; the quotation for returning the empties was 6d. per truck load per mile, the weight to be contained in the truck not to exceed 2½ tons, and the minimum weight either full or empty on this quotation to be one ton. Basing our calculations upon these quotations we found that it would cost us 1s. per case, equal to 1d. per quart to bring milk packed in this form from Aylesbury to London, the distance being only 49 miles; from Chippenham (where we also have a factory), distance 94 miles, the cost of freight would have been 21d., equal to l¾d per quart; whereas the ordinary freight on milk in cans is 1d. per imperial gallon, up to 50 miles, and lid. up to 100 miles. You will at once see that it was impossible for us to do as we had wished under these circumstances, namely, to receive our milk at Aylesbury and Chippenham, and bottle it at our factories there, thereby securing a much more cleanly mode of transit than in the cans. Consequently we had no alternative but to bring our milk to London in the usual way, in cans, and do the bottling at our Kensal Road premises. We are, Sir, yours very truly Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Co., Bottled Milk Department, London, September 19th 1905. (Frank Hills, Manager). The preceding extracts show how easily milk may be contaminated in railway transport and how difficult it is to obtain the only remedy for pollution in transit from the farm to the consumer. The best solution is the transport of milk in bottles, but unfortunately it is also the most expensive. 130 Food destroyed.—The following food, unfit for human consumption, was destroyed during the year:— Date.

ADULTERATED FOOD. BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (INTELLIGENCE DIVISION). Extract from the Annual Report for 1904. Adulteration in Transit.—The agricultural view of the Sections in the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts which relate to warranty, has been expressed in numerous communications both from individuals and associations, insisting that farmers are unduly exposed to the risk of a prosecution under these Sections. Milk sent with a warranty to a distant town may be adulterated by some person after it leaves the possession of the farmer, and if the milkman, on being summoned, produces the warranty and proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he is not responsible for the adulteration, the farmer thereupon becomes liable to prosecution. The chief risk is that the milk may be adulterated by some of the numerous carmen, roundsmen and others through whose hands it passes after arrival at the receiving station, but it may also happen that the milk is tampered with at some point on the journey. An instance of the latter risk was brought under the notice of the Board this year. A farmer residing in Bedfordshire, and sending milk to Tottenham Station, via Kentish Town Station, was summoned on the 7th January, 1904, under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts for selling milk adulterated with 36 per cent, of water, and fined £9. It was proved in Court that the milk was left standing on the platform at Kentish Town Station, where it changed trains, for about an hour. About three months later a porter was detected at Kentish Town Station removing milk from a churn and adding water, and was sentenced to six weeks imprisonment. The grounds for supposing that the farmer had been wrongfully convicted were so strong that the Home Office directed the fine to be reduced by £8. 132 BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (INTELLIGENCE DIVISION). Extract from the Annual. Report for 1904. Scaling of Churns.—The sealing of churns, by which the possibility of milk being tampered with while in the possession of the Railway Companies may be reduced to a minimum, is recommended by the leading Dairy Farmers' Associations. In this connection the following extract from the Annual Report of the Northumberland and Dairy Farmers' Association for the year 1904 may be quoted :— "We have had several cases of prosecution for milk adulteration "In one of these cases we certainly think the milk had been tampered with "on the railway; and until members will take the easy and sensible plan of "sealing the cans sent by rail, they will always be liable to prosecution "for what may be no fault of theirs. After great difficulty we have "succeeded in getting cheap yet effective pincers and lead seals, and there "is no excuse for neglecting this obvious precaution, as the Railway " Companies now allow it, and the cost is a mere trifle." In spite, however, of the publication of the information that the sealing of churns is not forbidden by the Railway Companies, it is evident from the inquiries addressed to the Hoard on the subject, and from the misleading statements made in many quarters, that there are many people who still think it is prohibited. The Board thought it advisable therefore, during the month of June, to republish in the form of a leaflet the correspondence which passed, in 1899, between the Board of Trade, the Railway Companies' Association, and the Board themselves on the subject, and which was originally printed in the Journal of the Board of Agriculture for March, 1900. A large number of these leaflets have been distributed, and it is to be hoped that the advantages of the practice of sealing churns will be more fully appreciated. It is asserted, however, that it is still possible to pilfer milk from many churns, while it is obvious that the risks to the farmers arising out of the adulteration of milk after it arrives at the receiving station are not in any way affected by the sealing of churns. As to the tealing of milk in transit.— In March, 1903, your Committee communiesd with the London and North Western Railway Company, the Great No hern Railway Company, the Midland Railway Company, and the Metropolian Railway Company, asking whether they prohibited milk churns consigned to them for carriage from being fastened, and if so, whether any precautions were adopted against the milk being tampered with in transit. Replies were received from the two first-mentioned Railway Companies that they allowed cans to be sealed provided that the tare was conspicuously marked on the outside. The two last-mentioned Companies apparently required the churns to be left open in order that they might be gauged or sampled by their local Inspectors. In 1905 the Medical Officer of Health enquired by circular letter for the regulations of all the Railway Companies having termini in London, and 133 he found that they all adopted uniform conditions for the carriage of milk, presumably as a result of the Committee's action in 1903. The conditions in question are as follows:— "Conditions of Carriage. " (a) Every can containing milk must be distinctly addressed, and the " address label must be made of wood or metal. " (b) The lids of the milk cans must be properly fastened to the cans. "(c) The cans must be legibly stamped with the name of the station from " which they are sent when full. " (d) " Each can (except hereinafter provided for) must have the number " of imperial gallons it is capable of containing marked upon it, and " the inside of each can must be marked to indicate the space " occupied by eight gallons, and by each additional gallon. In the " case of 'sealed' cans, instead of the inside of the can being marked, " each can must have its 'tare' conspicuously stamped thereon " outside. "(e)The Company will not undertake cither the collection or delivery of "milk. "(f) The senders and consignees must assist in the loading and unloading " of the cans when the milk is carried at the reduced rate. "(q) No milk cans, capable of containing more than 17 imperial gallons " of milk, except cans in use prior to 1st of January, 1893, will be " accepted for conveyance. "(h) The Officials of the Company shall have the power to open any cans " during transit, and if necessary to detain the same for a reasonable " time, in order to ascertain if the quantity of milk therein agrees " with the quantity declared. "(i) Senders must, in each case, sign consignment notes showing the " actual quantity of milk to be forwarded, the name of consignee, and " the station to which it is to be sent. The Company reserve the " right to refuse to accept milk, if and whenever the consignment " note does not contain this information, or is not so signed. " (j) Two rates are in operation for the carriage of milk: One the " ordinary rate, when the Company accept the ordinary liability of a " railway company with respect to the carriage of perishable merchandise " by passenger train; the other, a reduced rate, adopted when the " sender agrees to relieve the Company and fill other companies or " persons over whose lines the traffic may pass or in whose possession " the same may bo during any portion of the transit, from all liability " for loss, damage, mis-delivery, delay or detention, either with respect " to the milk or the milk cans when full or empty, except upon proof that " such loss, damage, mis-delivery, delay, or detention, arose from wilful " misconduct on the part of the Company's servants. " (k) The carriage of milk must be prepaid." In December, 1905, the Borough Council resolved—"That the Railway Companies be asked to accept milk for transit only when enclosed in properly sealed receptacles." 134 BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (INTELLIGENCE DIVISION). Extract from the Annual Report for the year 1904. Weighing Accommodation. — An impression would seem to prevail among farmers that it is incumbent upon railway companies to provide weighbridges at all stations open to goods traffic, and several applications for assistance have reached the Board from farmers and others who have felt themselves aggrieved at the lack of weighing accommodation at the particular stations they are in the habit of using. In most cases the Board have replied to the effect that, although a railway company is empowered to charge a reasonable sum for weighing merchandise at the request or for the convenience of traders, they are not under any statutory obligation to provide weighbridges at their stations. At the same time, the Board have intimated that they are prepared to make enquiries and to endeavour to arrange for the desired accommodation in specific cases in which the amount of traffic at a particular station seems to indicate the need of such accommodation. Enquiries have been instituted into all the complaints received, but in no case have the circumstances appeared to warrant any representation being made to the railway company concerned. Inability to pronccute in case of Adulterated Milk.—A sample of milk taken by one of the Food Inspectors from a churn on a van at Euston Station proved on analysis to be adulterated by 70 per cent, of added water, and a prosecution was ordered to be taken. After the sample was taken the carman said to the Inspector "It is no use "denying it, for it is separated milk, and I may as well own to it." He further stated in reply to questions that it was no particular farmer's milk, and that he brought it from the yard to mix with the milk coming in by train, which he then intended taking on his round and supplying to his customers. Upon Messrs. Ricketts & Son being instructed in the matter they stated that they could not advise proceedings because there was no sale to the prejudice of the purchaser so as to bring the case within the 6th section of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875; nor could the Inspector proceed under section 13 of the same Act because that section also requires that the milk shall have been sold to him; neither could the circumstances be brought within the 3rd section of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act (Amendment Act), 1879, inasmuch as that section requires that the Inspector shall procure at the place of delivery a sample of milk in course of delivery to the purchaser or consignee in pursuance of a contract for the sale to such purchaser or consignee of such milk. The reasons why they did not advise proceedings may be summed up in the circumstance that the sample was not procured at the place of delivery or in course of delivery. The Solicitors pointed out, however, that the carman is liable to be pros cuted by his employers if it be found that he put water into the milk without their knowledge or authority. The Solicitors were subsequently instructed to apply for a summons against the carman and his employers. This they did, when the Magistrate intimated that he could not grant a summons as he was of opinion that no offence 135 had been committed against the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and although he thought fraud was intended, nothing had been done which would warrant a charge of fraud or attempted fraud. The full facts of the case were reported to the Local Government Board, the Board of Agriculture, and the carman's employer, in March, 1906. PRESERVATIVES AND COLOURING MATTERS IN FOOD. Report of the Departmental Committee of the Local Government Board on the use of Preservatives and Colouring Matters in Food.—1901. Recommendations. (a) That the use of formaldehyde or formalin, or preparations thereof, in foods or drinks be absolutely prohibited, and that salicylic acid be not used in a greater proportion than 1 gr. per pint in liquid food, and 1 gr. per pound in solid food. Its presence in all cases to be declared. (b) That the use of any preservative or colouring matter whatever in milk offered for sale in the United Kingdom be constituted an offence under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. (c) That the only preservative which it shall be lawful to use in cream be boric acid or mixtures of boric acid and borax, and in amount not exceeding 0.25 per cent., expressed as boric acid. The amount of such preservative to be notified by a label upon the vessel. (d) That the only preservative permitted to be used in butter and margarine be boric acid or mixtures of boric acid and borax, to be used in proportions not exceeding 0.5 per cent., expressed as boric acid. (e) That in the case of all dietetic preparations intended for the use of invalids or infants chemical preservatives of all kinds be prohibited. (f) That the use of copper salts in the so-called greening of preserved foods be prohibited. (g) That means be provided either by the establishment of a separate Court of Reference or by the imposition of more direct obligation on the Local Government Board to exercise supervision over the use of preservatives and colouring matters in foods, and to prepare schedules of such as may be considered inimical to the public health. 136 Milk Sampling Analysis.—An analysis of the Inspectors' Sampling Books and of the Quarterly Returns of the Public Analyst (omitting samples sent direct to him and not through the Public Health Department) show the following circumstances and results as regards milk:— Stage of Sale.

Unfortunately the second sample is not a sample of the inculpated milk, but it may in some measure be evidence of the bona or male fides of the guarantor. 137 Analyses.—Samples taken under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts:— Articles of Food of which samples have been taken.

FOOD INSPECTORS' REPORTS. The following are the Reports of the Sanitary Inspectors of Food and Food premises:— To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I herewith submit my Annual Report for the year ended December 31st, 1905, upon my work in the Southern and Western Divisions of the Borough of St. Pancras. Markets. The market streets, stalls, costers' barrows, butchers', greengrocers', fish shops, and fish curing premises have been inspected daily, 2,300 inspections have been made and the following articles of food destroyed as being unfit for human food. 10 barrels of grapes. 48 boxes of dates. 3½ bushels of dates. Carcase of pig. 16 gals, of milk. 8 stones of fish (plaice). 10 ½ lbs. of cherries. 14 stones of plums. Food Makers.—I have made 448 inspections of premises where food stuffs are made, such as sausages, polonys, pork pies, &c., and have found the meat and other ingredients use free from diseases and wholesome, and the premises, machinery, &c., clean. Slaughter-homes.—There are 13 slaughter-houses in the Southern and "Western Divisions, which I have inspected 286 times and found them kept in accordance with the L.C.C. By-laws. I have seen a number of animals slaughtered, examined the carcases and offals and have found all free from disease and of first-class quality. Cow-sheds.—There are five licensed cow-sheds, registered to keep 102 cows; 95 inspections have been made, the premises have been kept clean, and the L.C.C. By-laws observed. There has not been any disease amongst the animals, all of which are good quality cows. Milkshops.—I have make 416 inspections of the registered milkshops and dairies, and have found the L.C.C. regulations as to cleanliness fairly complied with. Food and Drugs Acts.—I have submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis 375 samples of milk, butter, coffee, &c., and four samples of canal water, taken from certain parts of the Regent's Canal within the Borough of St. Pancras. Bacterial Examination. —I have submitted eight samples of milk for examination; one sample I seized under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and conveyed it to the Police Court. I obtained a Magistrate's Order to 140 destroy the milk, it being found to be unwholesome and unfit for the food of man; subsequently proceedings were taken against the farmer sending the milk, and he was fined £25 and £5 5s. costs. The above case was the first ever taken under the before-mentioned Act, and it being well reported resulted in a great improvement as to the cleanliness of milk sent to London. I have examined some hundreds of churns of milk since but have not found any in such a dirty condition as to warrant me making a seizure. Manipulation of Milk at Railwy Stations.—It being part of my duties as Food Inspector to meet the trains bringing milk into London at the railway station in my divisions, I have given, during the past year, special attention to trains arriving at the Euston Station of the L. & N.-W. Railway. As the trains arrive there are a number of porters who at once set to work to put the churns on to the platform; sometimes the carmen of the consignees are there waiting, at other times the churns are left on the platform for hours unprotected, neither locked nor sealed; when the men are waiting for the arrival they at once examine the churns, and as a rule remove the labels therefrom, and frequently take milk from one churn and put it into another not necessarily sent from the same consignor. I have been told it is to make up the quantities they have to deliver direct to their customers; and I have also seen the foreman of large milk dealers examine the churns consigned to them, go over the churns and take some of the top milk from each, then go over them again and carefully fill up to a certain measure. I do not know what they use for filling up to the requisite measure. It is also a practice to bring emply churns when they meet the milk trains. I have frequently noticed that one or more churns have been left on the vans, and on several occasions I have removed the lids off those churns and have seen some white liquid in them. I have always been suspicious of that liquid. I have watched and found when the fresh milk has arrived that this liquid has been mixed with the fresh milk or the fresh milk put into the churns with the liquid, and I have also seen separated milk mixed with fresh arrival milk. Warranties.—With large milk dealers it is often a practice for their foremen to mix different farmers' milks on the platform and serve it direct to their customers from the station; yet if a sample is taken and found adulterated they are always ready to swear it is a certain farmer's milk and produce his warranty, while it is impossible for an Inspector to refute the same; neither can a prosecution be taken for adulteration or mixing at the stations, as the sample must be taken at the places of delivery, which are mostly outside the Borough where the milk is consigned to. Legal Proceedings.—I have attended the Police Court 46 times in connection with my duties as Prosecuting Food Inspector, a decrease of four as compared with the year 1904. I am, Sir, yours obediently, J. Osborne. Meat and Food Inspector. 141 Canal Boats Act. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, During the year I have inspected 65 dwelling boats, and discovered one case of mixing of the sexes of prohibited ages, and one boat in bad repair and in an insanitary condition. I served notices on the owners of the boats, which notices were complied with. There has not been any case of infectious disease or other illness on any of the boats inspected during the year, and the Canal Boats Regulations have been well observed by the boat dwellers. I am, Sir, yours obediently, J. Osborne, Canal Boat Inspector. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to report on my work in the Northern and Eastern Divisions of the Borough for the year ended December 31st, 1905. Markets.-—I made 1,627 inspections of the various market places, including butchers', poik butchers', poulterers', fishmongers', greengrocers' shops and stalls, and when necessary made applications to the Magistrates sitting at the Police Courts to condemn and order the destruction of certain unsound food. The following articles of food were destroyed, being unfit for the food of man:— 15 cwt. of strawberries. 9 cwt. of tomatoes. 2 cwt. of fish (skate). 6 cwt. of haddocks. 42 lbs. of plaice. 2 pigs. 2 sheep. 1 lamb. ½ pigs head. 12½ lbs. salt beef. And a quantity of oranges. Food Makers.—I made 280 visits of the premises where sausages, ice-cream, extract of meat, tripe, &c., are made, and, with few exceptions, found the premises satisfactory and the food sound. Licensed Slaughter-houses.—There are 8 private slaughter-houses in the division, and I made 269 inspections, during which I saw 884 sheep, 123 bullocks, 123 pigs. 45 lambs, and 3 calves killed and dressed, and such carcases and organs as on examination were found to be diseased I had removed by the written request of the owners, under Sub-section 8 of Section 47 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. 142 The following table shows the number of animals found to be diseased, nature of disease, &c.:— No. Description of Carcase. Disease. Where Affected.

Milkshops.—I made 403 visits to milkshops, and, with ten exceptions, found the milk vessels generally satisfactory. During these visits I found 25 persons selling milk without being registered in accordance with the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Orders. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.—I obtained 375 samples of articles of food and drugs for analysis by the Public Analyst, of which 50 were adulterated. Of the samples of milk 42 were taken promiscuously at the St. Pancras (M.R.) and King's Cross (G.N.R) Stations, and only one sample found to be adulterated and this to the extent of one per cent. only. I have kept special observations at the railway stations, both in the night and day, of the methods of the men in the milk trade. I found it was the common practice of the men to remove the warranty labels from the churns. I have seen men in the employ of some wholesale milk dealers, who attend for the milk consigned to their firms, dip out a certain quantity of milk from each churn, and then replace the amount removed by other milk; I have seen separated milk used for this purpose. In a good many cases milk is mixed on the stations, then a number of churns are taken away by the carman to serve his customers, in some cases the remainder of the churns are left for hours on the station unlocked and unsealed, therefore left unprotected. If a sample of milk was taken from one of these men and found to be adulterated a certain farmer's name no doubt would be given as having supplied the milk under warranty, and the wholesale firm's defence succeed. 143 While the firms are protected by the warranty given by the farmers they themselves in a good many cases refuse to give a warranty to the retailers. During the year I have attended the Police Courts 64 times in the discharge of my duties. I am, Sir, yours obediently, Harry R. Child, Inspector of Meat and other Food. VI.—LEGISLATION. § 1.—GENERAL ACTS. § 2.—LOCAL ACTS. During the year no General or Local Acts of Parliament of Public Health or Sanitary importance became law. § 3.—ORDERS. Under the head of Factories and Workshops, Part IV., Sanitation, § 5, the new Home Work Order of August 15, 1905 (No. 983), has been already quoted. § 4.—BY-LAWS. § 5—REGULATIONS. Under Part V. Food, § 3, Adulterated Food, will be found the recommendations of the Departmental Committee of the Local Government Board on the use of preservatives and colouring matters in food. Sanitary Conveniences.—The following requirements were approved by the Public Health Committee:— ST. PANCRAS BOROUGH COUNCIL. Public Health Department. REQUIREMENTS WITH REGARD TO URINALS. (Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, Sec 22.) Size. A urinal enclosure should be of such minimum size and dimensions as to be usable without soiling the clothes of the users. A urinal of one stall under such conditions would not be of less horizontal dimensions than three feet by four feet, with an entrance not less than two and a half feet wide. 144 Entrance. The entrance to a urinal should have a shield or screen or automatically closing door offering as little obstruction as possible to the inlet of air. Stalls. If basins are provided they should contain water. If basins are not provided the front of each stall shall have a hard, even, impervious surface of slate or glazed earthenware or other similar material as smooth as possible, and inclined vertically in order to reduce adherence and corrosion to a minimum and to facilitate flushing, and should be provided along the top with a sparge pipe supplied by a cistern. Water Supply. Water should be supplied to the urinal stalls either by an automatic flush tank or a hand flush tank. A tap for washing down the walls and floor of the urinal should also be provided and so fixed that it will not be likely to be polluted, and the water should be taken from a supply cistern and not directly from the main. Walls. The internal surfaces of the walls of a urinal should be constructed of hard, smooth, impervious material. Floor. The floor of a urinal should be constructed of hard, smooth, impervious material so levelled as to drain away all liquids to a proper gulley situated within the urinal enclosure. Ventilation. An enclosed urinal should have a permanent opening or openings direct into the outer air at the top or side and of a total superficial area of at least one-tenth of the floor space, and at least one half of the area of the opening or openings should be situated at the top of the urinal. Lighting. Sufficient daylight should be admitted so that every part of the urinal can be easily seen. Artificial light should be provided so as to properly light the interior of the urinal after daylight. § 6.—LEGAL DECISIONS. REGISTRATION OF TENEMENT OCCUPIERS. SUPREME COURT OF JUDICATURE. King's Bench Division. (Before Lord Chief Justice Alverstonk and Justices Wills and Darling.} November 7th, 1905. COURT OF APPEAL. (Before the Master of the Rolls, Lord Justice Romer, and Lord Justice Matthew.) November 15th and 167i, 1905. Kent and Another v. Fit tali. Parliamentary and municipal registration—Inhabitant occupier of a dwellinghouse—Lodger—Person occupying one room—Landlord residing in 145 house—Representation of the People Act, 1867 (30 & 31 Vict. cap. 102, sec. 3)—Parliamentary and Municipal Registration Act, 1878 (41 & 42 Yict. cap. 26), sec. 5. The landlord of a house occupied and resided in a set of rooms in the house, and let the rest of the rooms to weekly tenants, each tenant having the exclusive use of the room or rooms let to him and a right to such use of the staircases and passages as was necessary for ingress and egress. Each tenant had a key of the front door. There was also let to the tenants the use in common of the courtyard, w.c., and washhouse. The cleansing of the passages and staircases was shared in common by those using the same. The house was rated as a whole in the name of the landlord, and he was under a covenant with the owner to keep the premises in repair. The Revising Barrister found that the landlord had no right of control or dominion over the rooms let or over the parts of the house used in common, his use of and right of control over the parts used in common being identical with those of his tenants; and that he did not reserve to himself or exercise any right of general control or dominion or mastership over the premises. Held, by the Court of Appeal, that upon the facts found by the Revising Barrister the tenant of a room in the house was an inhabitant occupier of a dwelling-house, and not a lodger, and was entitled to have his name placed upon Division 1 of the Occupiers' List of Voters. Where rooms in a house are let out as separate dwelling houses, the fact that the landlord resides upon the premises does not of itself make the occupiers of the rooms lodgers. The question whether or not they are lodgers depends upon whether the landlord retains a right of control over the rooms let to them. McLaughlin v. Chambers (1896), 2 I.R. 497, approved. Decision of the King's Bench Division reversed. (J. P. December 16, 1905.) KING'S BENCH DIVISION. (Before Mr. Justice Walton). London County Council (Appellants) v. Cook (Respondent). Inhabited House Duty.—Common Lodging House.— The Revenue Act, 1903, section 11. This was a case stated by the Commissioners for the General Purposes of the Income Tax, and raised the question as to whether lodging houses erected by the appellants under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, were exempt from inhabited house duty. 146 Mr. Macmorran, K.C., and Mr. Ryde appeared for the appellants; the Solicitor-General and Mr. S. A. T. Rowlatt for the respondent. (The premises in question were Nos. 25 to 37, Parker Street, St. Gilesin-the-Fields). Mr. Justice Walton, in giving judgment, said that the case was sufficiently clear. It might well be, for the reasons stated by Mr. Macmorran, that houses like those in question ought to have the benefit of the exemption. But all he had to consider was whether in fact they were entitled to it. Did this building come within the Act of Parliament? In order to bring it within it, it seemed to be plainly necessary to make out that the cubicles were separate dwelling-houses, for, if they were not that, they were not within the Act. Certain rules and regulations were made for the management of the houses. (His Lordship read them.) These cubicles occupied the three upper floors, and on the ground floor other accommodation was provided. It seemed to him sufficiently plain that what was provided was—on the three upper floors sleeping accommodation only, and on the ground floor the accommodation, other than sleeping accommodation, which a dwelling-house provided—namely, lavatories, dining-room, servants' quarters, etc. It seemed to him that these cubicles were merely sleeping places, and not. separate dwelling-places. Mr. Macmorran had said that a house could not be an inhabited dwelling-house unless the person inhabiting it slept there. But it did not follow from that that a bedroom merely was a dwelling-house. The appeal must be dismissed. (" The Times," Saturday, December 9th, 1905.) Agar r. Nokes and another. August 9th, 1905. (Before Alverstone, L. C. J., Lawrence and Ridley, J. J.) Public Health (London)—Nuisance—Old drain restored on old level on new concrete bed—One old pipe and gully replaced—Four new pipes and gully — "Reconstruction" or "repair"—Bylaws of London County Council made under s. 202 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855 18 & 19 Vic., c. 120). A surface water drain in a yard, carrying slop water from a sink, which was not laid on concrete or ventilated, communicated with a sewer. A notice in respect of this drain having been served on the owner by the sanitary authority, he broke the socket of a pipe close to the sewer, and removed live pipes and two gullies. Having laid a bed of concrete, he laid thereon four new lengths of pipe and a new gully and connection at side, replacing one old length of pipe and gully which had been at the other end of the drain to the sewer. This line of pipes was laid on the same line and on the same level as the old line, but it was not ventilated. Held, that the owner had "reconstructed" a drain within the meaning of certain by laws (Nos 2 and 21), made by the London County Council under s. 202 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855. (J. P., vol. 69, p. 374, .November 4th, 1905; Knight's L. G. Reps. No. 11, vol. 3, November, 1905, with plan). 147 Nathan v. Rouse. 1.—Drains—Public Health—Nuisance—"Acts or defaults" of two or more persons—Right to contribute—Public Health (London) Act, 1891, (54 and 55 Vict., c. 75,) ss. 4, 5, 120. The defendant's premises were drained through a drain running under the plaintiff's premises, which drain for part of its length carried only the defendant's drainage, and for the rest of its length carried the drainage of both premises The defendants had a right so to use the drain. A nuisance having arisen on the plaintiff's premises owing to the whole of the drain being defective, and permitting sewage to escape, the sanitary authority took proceedings against him, under ss. 4 and 5 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and obtained an order upon him to do the work necessary to abate the nuisance. The plaintiff did the work and abated the nuisance, all the work being done upon his own premises. Held, that the plaintiff could not recover from the defendants a proportionate part of the costs of abating the nuisance, as being one of two or more persons "by whose act or default" the nuisance had been caused, within the meaning of s. 120 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Nathan v. Rouse. Div. Ct. (1905), 1 K, B, 527. Water Supply to Tenement Houses.—A Metropolitan Magistrate decided, in a case. instituted by the Woolwich Borough Council, that a stand-pipe in a yard at the rear of the premises was not "a proper and sufficient supply of water "within the meaning of section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, for a tenement house of three storeys, with six rooms, occupied by five families. Subsequently another Metropolitan Magistrate at Marylebone Police Court, in a case instituted by the Paddington Borough Council, held that the words "proper and sufficient supply" referred to the source of the supply, and not to the provision of taps within the house, and the case was dismissed with costs against the Council, the Council having served notice on the owner to provide water on each floor of a tenement house. 148 VII—REPORTS OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH.
