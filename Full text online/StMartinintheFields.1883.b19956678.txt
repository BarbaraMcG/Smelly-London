The Vestry have caused 104 Notices for Abatement of Nuisances to be served during the past year, and in all cases such notices have been complied with. 10 PARLIAMENTARY BILLS. The United Telephone Company's Bill. This being a Bill affecting the interests of the public and of the local authorities throughout the Metropolis, the Vestry were of opinion that it could best be dealt with by a central representative authority, they therefore requested the Metropolitan Board to oppose the same, and that Board subsequently petitioned against the Bill. Metropolis Water Bill. This was a Bill promoted by the City Corporation for the supply of water by measure throughout the Metropolitan area, with regard to which the Vestry decided to take no action. The Bill was thrown out on second reading. Edison and Swan United Electric Light Company. The provisions of this Bill being confined simply to a transfer for the purpose of uniting the formerly distinct companies, no action was taken thereon. The Bill was subsequently withdrawn, and a Provisional Order for the like purpose was lodged with the Board of Trade. Metropolitan Railway (Park Railway and Parliament Street Improvement) Bill. As this Bill contained the usual clauses protective of the rights of the local authorities, and it appeared that it would not prejudicially affect local interests, the Vestry decided not to oppose the Bill, which was referred to a Select Committee on the 11th March 1884. London Central Electric Railway Bill. This Bill containing the usual protective clauses, the Vestry decided not to oppose the same. 11 Parliamentary Bills—continued. Metropolitan Board of Works (Further Powers) Bill, This was a Bill to confer further powers upon the Metropolitan Board, with respect to applications to Parliament and legal proceedings relating to the supply of water in the Metropolis, upon which no action was taken by the Vestry. The Bill has been referred to a Select Committee. PETITIONS TO PARLIAMENT. On the 12th of July, 1883, the Vestry resolved to petition the House of Commons in favour of the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, which provides for the more effectual prosecution of brothel-keepers, the protection of young girls, and the suppression of immorality in the public streets. On the 20th March, 1884, the Vestry resolved to petition the House of Commons praying that an addition might be made to Clause 215 of the Companies' Acts Consolidation Bill, to provide for the preferential payment in cases of bankruptcy of all parochial and other rates and assessed taxes, land property, and income tax. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. On the 4th May, 1883, the Vestry resolved, subject to certain conditions, to support the application of the Edison Electric Lighting Company (Limited), for a Provisional Order for the public and private lighting of the parish by electricity. An inquiry was held by the Board of Trade at the Sessions House, Westminster, on the 9th May, 1883, at which the Clerk attended, and on the 17th May, 1883, he 12 Electric Lighting—continued. reported to the Vestry that at such inquiry it was evidenced that the portion of the parish lying eastward of Wellington Street and Bow Street, and extending to Drurv Lane, had not been included in the area to be lighted by the " Edison " Company, but was proposed to be lighted by the "Swan" Company, and that under the circumstances he had opposed the granting of Orders to both Companies. The Clerk stated that it was alleged that there were engineering difficulties which prevented the efficient carrying out of the work by the "Edison" Company, and that he had been informed that the President of the Board of Trade was disposed to favour the application of the "Swan" Company for lighting the portion in question, whereupon it was resolved that the Board of Trade be informed that the Vestry regretted that the concession for lighting the entire parish would not be granted to one Company, but that they did not oppose the granting of a Provisional Order to the "Swan" Company, provided the Order was on the same bases as agreed with the "Edison" Company. On the 26th July, 1883, the Vestry considered letters from the Jablochkotf Electric Lighting Company and the Strand District Board of Works, when it was resolved to inform the District Board that it was the opinion of the Vestry that if the Jablochkoff Company obtained a seven years' licence for lighting the Covent Garden area, they should also have allotted to them that portion of this parish lying between the Strand and Covent Garden, and bounded on the west by Southampton Street, and also the outlying portion of the parish lying between Drury Lane on the east and Covent garden on (he west, and the Clerk was instructed to attend 13 Electric Lighting—continued. the Select Committee of the House of Commons to give evidence in support of the recommendation. On the 9th August, 1883, the Clerk reported that Electric Lighting Provisional Order Bill No. 5, embracing this Parish and that of St. James, had been passed by the Commons, who had reduced the maximum price to be charged from 9d. to 8d. per unit, and that the offer of the Jablochkoff Company to light a portion of this parish, under a license for seven years, had been rejected by the Committee. On the 23rd August the Clerk reported that the Bill had received the Royal assent. On the 4th October, 1883, the Vestry considered a joint letter from the "Edison" Company and the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company, requesting the assignment to the West London Electric Lighting Company of that portion of the parish lying westward of the road between the Reform and Carlton Clubs, Pall Mall, when it was resolved that they and the Board of Trade be informed that the Vestry had no objection to the proposed transfer. On the 29th November, 1883, the Vestry considered an application for a Provisional Order to transfer to the Edison and Swan United Electric Light Company the powers of the "Edison" and "Swan" Companies, when it was resolved not to oppose such amalgamation. Subsequently it was decided that, if such a proceeding became necessary, this Vestry should combine with the Vestries of St. James and St. George, Hanover Square, in opposition to any clauses which might prejudicially affect the interests of the respective parishes. 14 PROVISIONAL ORDERS FOR ELECTRIC LIGHTING. The undermentioned Companies have during the current year served copies of their Provisional Orders for the supply in the Parish of electricity for public and private lighting, viz.:— The Edison Electric Light Company, Limited. The Swan United Electric Light Company, Limited. The Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company, Limited. The Edison and Swan (United) Electric Light Company, Limited. The West London Electric Lighting Company, Limited. LIGHTING. During the current year a considerable improvement has been effected in the lighting of the parish, burners consuming 20 ft. per hour having been fitted to the lamps at the Refuges, and burners for general lighting consuming 6 ft. per hour having been substituted for those consuming 4 ft. per hour—the estimated cost per annum for lighting being thus increased from £2,460 to £3,430. On the 1st July, 1883, the price of gas for the supply of the public lamps was reduced from 3/2 to 2/10 per 1,000 cubic feet. WOOD PAVING. The Vestry having been urgently requested to extend the system of wood paving in the parish, entered into a contract with the Improved Wood Pavement Company for the laying down of wood paving in the following streets, viz.: St. Martin's Lane (part of), St. Martin's Place, Duncannon Street, Pall Mall East, Trafalgar Square (north, 15 Wood Paving—continued. south, east and west sides), Cockspur Street, Whitehall (part of), and Charing Cross. The works have been carried out by the Company at a cost of £15,063 65. 6d. The Vestry also entered into a contract with Messrs. Mowlem & Co., for relaying wood pavement in the Strand (originally laid by the Asphaltic Wood Pavement Company in liquidation): this work has been executed at a cost of £3,141 3.9. To meet (in part) the necessary expenditure, a mortgage of the General Rates of the Parish was effected with the Metropolitan Board of Works for £14,200, the interest payable on the same being at the rate of 3½ per cent per annum, the principal being repayable within five years by equal instalments of £2,840 per annum. The granite blocks displaced by the wood paving were sold to Mr. J. S. Gabriel for the sum of £2,608 4s. HYDE PARK CORNER ROADS. Counsel's opinion was submitted to the Vestry at their Meeting on the 3rd May, 1883, as to their liability for the maintenance of the above roads, and a letter (26th April), from Her Majesty's Commissioners of Works requiring the Vestry to take to the roads on and after the 1st May, 1883, was considered, when it was resolved that the Commissioners should be informed that at the then present time the Vestry were advised that 110 liability attached to them in respect of the same. On the 25th May, 1883, the Commissioners wrote to the Metropolitan Board of Works stating that this Vestry had declined to take over the roads, and suggesting that they should be treated as a Metropolitan improvement and that the Board should bear 16 Hyde Park Corner Roads—Continued. the cost of their maintenance. By a letter dated 4th July, the Vestry were informed by the Commissioners of Works that the Government would during the then present Session introduce a Bill for the purpose of enabling the Metropolitan Board to determine by what parish or parishes the maintenance of the roads should be borne. On the 23rd August, 1883, the clerk reported that the Bill of the Government had been withdrawn. At the invitation of the Vestry of St. George, Hanover Square, a conference between the Parliamentary Committees of both Vestries took place on the 12th November, 1883, when the Parliamentary Committee of St. George's stated that they intended to recommend their Vestry to pay two-thirds of the annual cost of maintenance of the roads on the understanding that this Vestry would take the remaining one-third of cost; this recommendation, however, the Vestry of St. George declined to adopt. On the 14th March, 1884, an exactly similar Bill to that withdrawn was introduced by the Government, and on the 20th March, 1884, it was resolved that this Vestry should combine with the Vestry of St. George, Hanover Square, to throw the cost of the roads upon the Metropolitan Board, and in the event of failure that the cost should be divided between the two parishes in the proportions previously stated. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. By a notice, dated 24th December, 1883, and duly published in the London Gazette, the Local Government Board declared that the enactment contained in Section 35 of the Sanitary Act, 1886 (as extended by the 47th Section of 17 Houses Let In Lodgings—continued. the Sanitary Law Amendment Act, 1874), had been put in force in this Parish. The sections give directions for the enforcing of certain regulations with respect to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and on 10th January, 1884, a temporary Inspector was appointed for the purpose. GAS COMPANIES—PROPOSED AMALGAMATION. The proposed amalgamation of the Gas Light and Coke Company with the South Metropolitan Gas Company was opposed by the Vestry, and they were subsequently informed by the Board of Trade that the Board had decided not to approve of the scheme. INSPECTION OP BAKE-HOUSES. By the Pactorie's and Workshops Act, 1883, the duty of inspection of retail bake-houses has been restored to the V estry. ARTIZANS' DWELLINGS ACTS. Proceedings have been taken by the Vestry under the above Acts against the owners of Nos. 2, 3, and 4, Chymister-alley, Bedfordbury, Nos. 4, 5, and 6, Hanover-court, Long Acre, and Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4, Lumley-court, Strand. On the 21st Pebruary, 1884, the respective owners of the properties appeared before the Vestry to state their objections to the specifications and estimates of the Surveyor, and on their giving an undertaking to cany out the required works to the satisfaction of the Vestry Surveyor, the Vestry suspended the making of a formal order for the performance of the same. 18 WATERWORKS COMPANIES' CHARGES. In reply to communications addressed to them by the Vestry calling attention to the decision in the case of Dobbs v. Grand Junction Waterworks Company, the Chelsea Waterworks Company have stated that they have determined to make their charges on the net value of each house, and that in all cases where the parochial net value agreed reasonably with the real value, the Company would adopt the valuation of the Vestry. The New River Company simply replied that it was their intention to regulate their charges strictly according to law. CHURCH PLATE. On the 4th October, 1883, Mr. Churchwarden James submitted to the Vestry a Deed of Declaration of Trust relating to the investment of a sum of money given by the Vicar and the proceeds from the sale of certain articles of plate in his possession as Vicar of the Parish, a vote of thanks to the Vicar for his generous donation was passed by the Vestry, and the Deed was ordered to be forwarded to Messrs.

JAMES JENKINS HENRY RICHARD BURTON Auditors Vestry Hall, 2nd July, 1884. MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT, 18 8 3. Annual Report on the Health of the Parish of St. Mar tin-in- the Fields, for the Year 1883. To the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you my Fourteenth Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Births. The Births registered in the year 1883 were 403, against 412 of the previous year. 63 The following Table gives the number of Births occurring in each month of the year:— Males. Females. Total. January 19 23 42 February 10 16 26 March 14 17 31 April 20 22 42 May 16 26 42 June 15 13 28 July 15 18 33 August 12 14 26 September 13 21 34 October 22 16 38 November 13 18 31 December 12 18 30 181 222 403 This is the lowest number of Births during the last ten years. The Registrar-General, in his Annual Summary for the year 1883, says:—"The births registered in London in the year (52 weeks) numbered 133,656, and were in the proportion of 339 to 1,000 inhabitants. This was the lowest birth-rate recorded since 1860, in which year the rate was only 33.6. The lowness of the birth-rate was more than compensated by the still greater reduction of the death-rate; for the registered births exceeded the 64 registered deaths by 53,078, against excesses 01 51,478, 51,558, and 50,396 respectively, in the three preceding years." Deaths. The Deaths during the year numbered 408. This mortality was the lowest of the last ten years. The following Table gives the number of Deaths occurring in each month of the year:— Males. Females. Total. January 37 28 65 February 22 14 36 March 21 28 49 April 15 14 29 May 21 14 35 June 18 12 30 July 23 9 32 August 12 8 20 September 7 8 15 October 13 18 31 November 21 13 34 December 20 12 32 230 178 408 Of the above 408 Deaths, 118 occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, and of this number who died 65 in the Hospital, 107 were non-residents in the Parish. In estimating the death-rate for the year, I have taken into consideration the deaths of Parishioners occurring in public institutions outside the Parish. This is the first occasion I have been enabled to take account of these deaths, for the year 1883 was the first time I was supplied with the returns from the office of the Registrar-General. Therefore this year the death-rate will be higher than in previous years in consequence of adding these to the deaths actually occurring in the Parish, but at the same time the death-rate will be more trustworthy. Deaths, 1883 408 Deduct non-residents who died in the Charing Cross Hospital 107 301 Add 45 Parishioners who died in Public Institutions outside the Parish 45 346 These 346 Deaths will be the number on which to estimate the death-rate. Death-rate per 1,000 of the population for the year 1883, 19.0. Ratio of deaths to population, 1 in 52.5. E 66 In estimating the death-rate, as in former years, that for the year 1883, instead of being 19 0 per 1,000, would be 166. The Registrar-General, in his Annual Summary for the year 1883, says:— "The deaths registered in the year numbered 80,578, and were in the proportion of 20.4 per 1,000 inhabitants. This was the lowest death-rate on record in London, the nearest approach to it having been in 1850, when the rate was 21*0. The highest death-rate as yet recorded was in 1849, when it reached 30.1, mainly owing to the great mortality from cholera. Omitting this cholera year, the highest rate was in 1847, when it reached 26.8." Appended is the annual death-rate per 1,000 in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields during the last ten years:— 1874 1.6 1875 18.3 1876 17.2 1877 16.9 1878 17.5 1879 18..6 1880 16.8 1881 18.5 1882 17.6 1883 19.0 67 Ages at Death. Of the 408 deaths, 74 occurred under 1 year, 72 from 1 to 5 years, 34 from 5 to 20 years, 28 from 20 to 40 years, 98 from 40 to 60 years, 49 from 60 to 80 years, and 3 above 80 years. Causes of Death. Zymotic Diseases.—The sevcu principal Zymotic Diseases, the diseases most influenced by sanitation, caused 56 deaths, inclusive of those which occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital. This number is 7 in excess of the previous year. This increase is due in a great measure to the preponderance of deaths from measles. The deaths from this disease in the Parish were greatly in excess of former years. Smallpox.—No death from this disease occurred in the Parish, but a case in a young child was removed from the Peabody Buildings to the Stockwell Smallpox Hospital where it died. The Relieving Officer reports 3 cases sent to the Smallpox Hospitals, the little child reported above being one of the number. In London 134 deaths occurred from this malady in the year 1883. Measles.—There were 27 deaths from this disease, an excessively high number. E 2 68 Scarlet Fever.—5 deaths were due to this complaint. Diphtheria.—5 deaths were caused by this disease, one of which was a non-parishioner, who died in the Charing Cross Hospital. Whooping Cough caused the death of 2 children, This number is the lowest of the last ten years. Fever.—This includes Typhus, Typhoid, Simple Continued Fever, and Remittent Fever. 6 deaths were registered from this class of disorders, they were all due to Typhoid Fever; 2 of which were those of non-parishioners who died at the Charing Cross Hospital. Diarrhœa.—11 deaths were caused by this malady, 9 of which were in young children. Diseases of the Respiratory Organs, including Consumption, destroyed 120. This number is 19 less than in the previous year. Diseases of the Heart.—32 deaths were due to this complaint, against 40 of the previous year. Cancer proved fatal to 15 persons. The deaths from all other causes, with the ages at death, will be found fully detailed further on. 69 Inquests. In the year 1883, 54 inquests were held. Subjoined are the causes which produced death:— Natural causes 19 Run over or knocked down in the street 5 Bums and scalds 3 Suffocation 3 Nitrous Oxide Gas when about to undergo operation 1 Poisoning, Laudanum 1 „ Carbolic Acid 1 Exposure of infant after birth 1 Pistol-shot wound 2 Injuries received on stage at Drury Lane Theatre 1 Injuries received in extinguishing fire at Alhambra Theatre 1 Injuries received from fall from a ladder 1 „ „ falling down stairs 4 „ „ „ from cab 1 „ „ fall from window 1 „ „ falling of wall at Turkish Bath, Leicester Square 1 Drowning, accidental 1 „ suicide when insane 4 „ (no evidence how deceased came into the water) 3 54 70 Sanitary Work. In the year 1883, 104 notices were served upon owners or occupiers of property, besides various verbal recommendations to remedy sanitary defects. One summons was taken out. The owner of 9, Bull Inn Court allowed a closet to be kept in a filthy state, and without a supply of water for flushing purposes. In spite of the service of a notice he still permitted the place to remain in the same condition. A summons was therefore taken out against the owner, when he was condemned in costs. In one of my fortnightly reports I brought under your notice ten houses which were in an unsanitary and dilapidated condition, that they might be dealt with under Torrens’ Act. The houses in question were 1, 2, 3. Chemister Alley, Bedfordbury, 4, 5, (5, Hanover Court, Long Acre, and 1, 2, 3, 4, Lumley Court, Strand. A committee was appointed to inspect them, who confirmed my views. Your Surveyor by your directions made a specification of the works necessary to be done for rendering these houses more habitable, a copy of which specification was served upon the respective owners, when they all attended one of your meetings, and promised to do the works specified. These improvements have since been 71 completed, and I need hardly say that, notwithstanding the oldness of these habitations, their condition has been considerably improved. At your Vestry Meeting of the 26th of July I brought under your notice several suggestions of a sanitary nature, in view of a possible visitation of cholera to this country. You may remember at that time this fearful malady had made its appearance among our troops, who were occupying Egypt, and there was a reasonable alarm that this plague might be imported into England, more especially as our communications with Egypt had so increased, possibly bringing with them the germs of cholera. Happily our fears were not realised. Should cholera unfortunately again invade this country, we shall be better prepared to meet it than in former outbreaks, owing to our better system of sanitation. At the time I speak of, with your approval, I drew up a sanitary circular, containing hints and directions as to cleanliness, &c., in houses This circular was freely distributed amongst the householders of the Parish. The pipe-sewers have been regularly flushed, those gullies emitting offensive effluvia have also been flushed with carbolic acid and water, and the several courts and passages in the Parish lime-whited. 72 In conclusion, I must again bear testimony to the zeal and intelligence of your Inspector in the discharge of his duties, and also acknowledge with thanks, the promptitude with which the Relieving Officer of the district keeps me informed of all infectious diseases and nuisances coming under his notice. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN J. SKEGG, Medical Officer of Health. 29, Craven Street, July, 1884. 73 BIRTHS and DEATHS, &c., for the last Ten Years. 1874 1875 1876 1877 1878 1879 1880 1881 1882 1883 Births 480 476 494 491 467 481 445 418 412 403 Deaths 511 503 418 466 519 557 491 451 474 408 ,, under 5 years 160 152 152 133 177 184 171 138 164 146 ,, from 5 to 60 258 260 191 247 256 282 249 225 248 210 ,, over 60 years 93 91 75 86 86 91 71 88 62 52 ,, from Smallpox 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ,, ,, Measles 8 2 5 5 3 5 5 7 7 27 ,, ,, Scarlet Fever 14 13 4 0 5 14 12 12 3 5 „ ,, Whooping Cough 10 13 11 5 12 12 20 7 13 2 „ ,, Diarrhoea. 11 19 18 8 12 7 17 10 7 11 „ ,, Fever 9 7 4 8 7 7 5 16 5 6 ,, „ Consumption 64 73 51 76 70 74 55 51 43 43 ,, in Charing Cross Hospital 157 150 78 153 186 198 160 148 188 118 Inquests 60 57 54 63 65 60 49 74 69 54 74 TABLE OF THE CAUSES OF DEATH, AT VARIOUS AGES, In the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, for the Year 1883.
