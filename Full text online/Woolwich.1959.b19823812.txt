STANDRING, M.D., B.S., D.P.H., M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P , F.R.S.H. Medical Officer of Health METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF WOOLWICH ANNUAL REPORT on the Health of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich for the Year 1959 by T. Standring, M.D.,B.S.,D.P.H.,M.R.C.S.,L.R.C.P.,F.R.S.H. Medical Officer of Health. PREFACE To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich. MR. MAYOR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have pleasure in presenting my Report for the year 1959 on the Public Health of the Borough of Woolwich, the Report being on the lines requested by the Minister of Health. The Registrar-General's estimate of the home population of the Borough was 144,800, being an increase of 200 on the previous year, and the first increase in population in the Borough for seven years. There was no significant change in the Borough's birth and death rates and infant death rate. After the startling rise in recent years in cancer deaths, it is indeed pleasing to note that there was a drop of 30 in the total cancer deaths in the Borough during the year. Deaths from coronary heart diseases were however high, as were deaths from pneumonia, bronchitis and influenza. With regard to infectious diseases, apart from the usual crop of measles notifications, the general incidence was low. Despite the hot summer of 1959 there were fortunately very few cases of poliomyelitis. This disease has not been prevalent in Woolwich since the epidemic of 1955. No cases of diphtheria occurred, although some dysentery was again troublesome. With regard to the general work of the Health Department during the year, it will be seen from the section of this Report dealing with Clean Air that rapid progress is being made by the Council in the establishment of Smoke Control Areas. The task of bringing under Smoke -2- Control large areas of the Borough is a considerable one, and the Council, and the staff engaged on this work have had a particularly busy year. If the present rate of progress is maintained it should be possible to see the whole of the Borough, the second largest in London, under smoke control within the next ten years. The Council have been helped in this work by the willing co-operation of residents. Supplies of smokeless fuel are now more plentiful in this locality, and most merchants have been able to keep their customers supplied with a satisfactory smokeless fuel. If householders would be prepared to accept a suitable reasonable alternative smokeless fuel when the delivery of the fuel of their first choice is delayed, very little difficulty should be experienced. There is good reason to think that the recent introduction of the newer brands of proprietary fuels now available on the market will help the supply position. Housing has again been one of the Council's major activities during 1959, and at the end of the year the work on the Council's Slum Clearance for the five year period ending 1960 was well up to the scheduled programme. With the representation as unfit of a large number of properties in the Glyndon Area during 1959 few slum properties included in the programme for clearance by the Council before the end of 1960 remain to be represented. There are signs that the general standard of food hygiene in the Borough has improved during the last year or two. Housewives in general are becoming much more food conscious and are taking more trouble to obtain food which is fresh and of a high standard of purity. For their part, most of the local food retailers are improving their food handling standards, and the hygiene of their premises, including the storage of food, and a number of improvements to food premises were obtained by the Council during the year. Food suspected of falling short of the requisite standard of fitness is these days invariably put on one side for the Food Inspector to pronounce on; this cooperation between the Food Inspector and the food retailer works to the advantage of all. During the year the Council inaugurated a Pupil Training scheme for Public Health Inspectors, and two pupils are now engaged. The pupils also assist with Smoke Control surveys. -3- I am pleased to have this opportunity of thanking the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their support and encouragement during the year; particular thanks are also due to the staff of the Health Department for their hard work and valuable assistance rendered to me during a particularly busy year. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, T. STANDRING. HEALTH COMMITTEE at 31st December, 1959 THE WORSHIPFUL THE MAYOR ( Alderman F.J.Munns, J.P.) Councillor Mrs.J.E.

No complaints were received by this Department during the year -17- as to the quality or quantity or the water supply In addition to the water supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board, local Industry obtains further supplies of water from wells in the Borough. There are seven wells still in use and water from these wells is used for fire-fighting as well as for industrial purposes. The Council's baths at Plumstead and Woolwich draw water from a well. Bacteriological examination of this well water showed the water to be satisfactory. DRAINAGE Two hundred and eleven drainage defects were found during the year, and the necessary work of repair or reconstruction was supervised by the Public Health Inspectors. Officers of the Department also supervised 34 smoke tests on suspected defective private or combined drains. Of the tests carried out, 16 showed positive results and the remainder negative. Three tests which also proved to be positive were in respect of disused drains. These drains were subsequently exposed and permanently sealed off. During the year, 29 combined drains were inspected and two were found to be defective. In respect of the defective combined drains, notices under Section 40 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, were served on the owners of the properties and the work of repair or reconstruction was carried out by the Borough Engineer's Department. The cost of the work involved was charged to the responsible owners. PET SHOPS There are ten pet shops in the Borough, and in accordance with the Pet Animals Act,1951, these shops are licensed annually by the Council. To ensure compliance with the Act and with the Council's conditions for the issue of such licences, 86 inspections were made during the course of the year. SHOPS ACT,1950 From the 1st January, 1959, certain functions which were formerly the responsibility of the County Council were -18- transferred to the Borough Councils, by the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1958. The additional functions relate to the suitability of lighting, washing facilities and facilities for employees taking meals in the shops in which they are employed. The Borough Council is also responsible for ensuring the suitability of temperature, ventilation and sanitary accommodation. Altogether the Public Health Inspectors made 543 Shops Act inspections during the year. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT,1933 At the annual review names were entered in the Council's list of persons entitled to sell Part II poisons (other than registered Pharmacists) in respect of 150 premises. THEATRES AND CINEMAS The sanitary conveniences in cinemas in the Borough were inspected at regular intervals throughout the year to ascertain that a satisfactory standard of cleanliness was maintained. The standard generally was found to be very good. PUBLIC BATHS AND WASHHOUSES The Council has four bathing establishments in the Borough. This service includes swimming baths, slipper baths, Turkish Baths, Public Laundry, and the use of the premises for social and sporting activities during the winter, which this year for the first time included Professional Wrestling at Eltham Baths. The demand for the improved Public Laundry service at Plumstead Baths continued to grow, and in the year 1958/59, 26,08l people attended, compared with 23,939 in 1957/58, 18,295 in 1956/57 and 12,924 In 1955/56. Attendances for slipper baths in 1958/59 totalled 116,533 and the total attendances for all services for the year was 698,590. Altogether 164,676 schoolchildren attended at the baths in organised classes for swimming and swimming instruction and 7,613 swimming lessons were provided for -19- members of the public. The detailed attendances for the year ended 31st March, 1959 were as follows:- Public Swimming 329,155 Swimming Tuition 7,613 School Swimming 164,676 Slipper Baths 116,533 Turkish Baths 10,576 Public Laundry - Hand Washing 12,614 Machine Washing 13,467 Swimming Clubs 33,983 Schoolchildren - Cricket School 4,088 Free Baths to Old Age Pensioners and Unemployed Persons 5,885 698,590 Water for the swimming baths at both Woolwich and Plumstead is drawn from deep wells and the supply to Eltham Swimming Baths is obtained from the Metropolitan Water Board mains. In all three swimming baths the water is continuously filtrated and chlorinated. Once every year the water in all the baths is completely changed. Routine sampling of water from the Council's swimming baths and boating and paddling pools and testing for pH reaction and chlorine content is carried out by the Health Department. Twenty nine samples were submitted to the Southern Group Laboratory at Hither Green Hospital for bacteriological examination and were also tested for chlorine content and pH reaction by the Health Department. The average results of the examinations and tests are as follows:- -20- Probable No. of Bacillus Coli per 100 m.1. Average PH Value Average free Chlorine Average temperature Swimming Baths 0 7.85 1.8 74.7° Paddling and Boating Pools Plate count per ml (average) 26 8.0 0.15 RAG FLOCK The Public Health Inspectors make regular inspections of premises where rag flock and other filling materials are manufactured and stored and various samples of these materials are obtained for the purpose of analysis. In the Borough there are three registered premises where filling materials to which the Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951, applies. The Council renewed in the course of the year, one licence to manufacture rag flock. During 1959 the following samples were submitted for analysis - 5 samples of Rag flock; 2 samples of Cotton felt; 4 samples of Woollen mixture felt; and 2 samples of Millpuff All the samples passed the prescribed standards of cleanliness. However, one sample of woollen felt mixture failed to meet the quality standard of a minimum 60 per cent animal fibre content. Although this was a failure on quality only and not covered by the Act, the matter was taken up with the manufacturers. -21- FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 - 1959 TABLE NO.10.

The homes of the outworkers are inspected regularly to ensure that the working conditions are satisfactory. The outworkers employed in the Borough were engaged on the following work Nature of Work No.of outworkers in August list required by Sec . 110(1)(c) No.of cases of default in sending lists to Council Prosecutions for failure to supply lists No.of instances of work in unwholesome premises Notices served Prosecutions Wearing apparel (Making etc.,cleaning and washing) 60 — — — — — Household linen 11 — — — — — The making of boxes or other receptacles or parts thereof made wholly or partially of paper 3 — — — — — Lampshades 130 — — — — — TOTAL: 204 — — — — — -23- HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS PREMISES In accordance with Section 18 of the London CountyCouncil (General Powers) Act, 1954, all persons carrying on the business of Hairdresser or Barber and their premises must be registered with the Borough Council. In addition, the Council has Byelaws to enforce the cleanliness of premises and the equipment used therein. At the end of the year, there were registered in the Borough, 47 ladies', 48 gentlemens' and ten combined ladies' and gentlemens' hairdressing premises. PROVISION OF DUSTBINS During the year 26 notices were served under the provisions of Section 12 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954, requesting landlords of premises in the Borough to supply dustbins. No appeals were made by landlords against the notices served by the Council. RODENT CONTROL During the year, 824 complaints of rats and 280 of mice were received, and in addition to the investigation of these complaints systematic inspection under the "block control" system was continued. A total of 21,722 premises were inspected and of these 12,090 were under "block control". The number of properties found to be infested by rats or mice was 1,851, which included 134 business or industrial premises. Where the cause of the infestation appears to be due to defective drains or other defects in the building, the owner is requested to effect the necessary repairs. In this connection the Department carried out 29 smoke tests on suspected defective drains at rat infested premises, and these tests produced evidence of 13 defective drains. A total of 38 "block control" schemes was carried out during the year. As in previous years, the Council continued its practice of arranging free treatment in respect of infestations in private dwellings. A charge is made for treatment carried out by the Council at -24- business or industrial premises. With the co-operation of the Borough Engineer's Department, two sewer treatments and test baiting were undertaken during 1959- The extended period of baiting was continued, pre-baiting being carried out on the first and fourth day and poison baiting on the eighth day. The bait used was sausage rusk with zinc phosphide as the poison and paranitrophenol as a preservative. Repeated baiting took place where there had been complete "takes". The Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food informed local authorities that although Government grants payable under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, ceased after the 31st March, 1959, the withdrawal of this specific grant did not imply any lessening of interest by the Minister in the exercise by local authorities of their functions under the Act. The Minister felt that local authorities would not only maintain the standard of control already exercised within their districts, but would continue their efforts to achieve progressive improvement. The Regional and Divisional pests staff of the Ministry has been reorganised so as to give an improved technical advisory service to local authorities, and rodent control information on up-todate methods resulting from research and development work both in this country and abroad is available to local authorities. WOODWORM AND OTHER PESTS Throughout the year, various complaints were received from residents in the Borough of infestations of woodworm, cockroaches, silver fish,clover mites and moths. All the complaints received were investigated and where required, the Department carried out the necessary disinfestation. In all, 6l houses were disinfested of woodworm, seven of clover mites,five of cockroaches and three of moths. Another house was disinfested of cockroaches, silver fish and beetles. One shop which was heavily infested with flies was also treated by the Department. Of the houses treated to rid them of woodworm 54 were -25- Council-owned houses. Charges made to the responsible persons for the work outlined above totalled £255.19.6. The fine summer was probably the cause of many requests from households for assistance in dealing with wasps. Altogether the staff of the Department destroyed and removed 35 wasps nests from gardens, garden sheds, roof spaces, eaves, etc., the economic cost of this work being recovered from the householder. In disinfestation for wasps the usual practice has been to visit the house concerned at dusk when the wasps have returned to their nest, and treat with sulphur-dioxide gas. The wasps are killed by the gas and it is then necessary to pay a further visit the following day to remove and burn the nest in order to destroy any grubs that may survive the gas. In an effort to simplify this procedure and in consequence lower the costs to residents, experiments were conducted at the latter end of the summer by the Department's Officers to endeavour to find a successful alternative method of extermination. A powder was finally developed which has merely to be sprinkled around the opening of the wasps nest in order to prove fatal to the wasps going in or out. The day after the powder has been used the nest can be safely removed and burned. In future it is proposed to use this method in dealing with complaints of wasps nests and the cost to residents would be a few shillings only. OLD PEOPLE Over 3,000 visits were made by the woman Health Inspector to the homes of the elderly in the Borough during the year. A number of new cases of elderly persons needing help came to the knowledge of the Department; some were found to be in urgent need of hospital or other medical attention, and this was arranged for them. Many of these people are living alone and efforts were made during the year to increase the number of visits made by voluntary workers to their homes. There is excellent liaison with medical practitioners, hospitals, old people's homes, district nurses and the -26- Home Help service. Assistance was given where necessary to medical practitioners in the removal of persons to more suitable accommodation. It was not necessary during the year to apply to the Courts for the compulsory removal of any persons to more suitable accommodation. The Borough Council is actively interested in all aspects of Old People's welfare and also makes substantial grants of money to voluntary organisations in the Borough for this work. The voluntary work carried out by a number of organisations in the Borough for the elderly is a credit to Woolwich and another fine example of this voluntary effort was the establishment during the year by the Victorians of their Old People's Club in Sherard Road, Eltham. The Borough Council made suitable premises available and assisted financially, and following a public appeal for subscriptions the Club premises were opened at the beginning of the year. The facilities available at this Club include a lounge equipped with television, a spacious recreation room for music, concerts, whist drives, a handicraft room, library, games room with snooker and darts and a dining room for daily lunches and teas. The Club is available to men over 65 and women over 60 who are resident in the Borough. It is open from Monday to Friday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. and is staffed by members of the W.V.S. with the help of other local voluntary organisations. Mobile Meals Service The delivery of hot meals to those aged persons who are unable to obtain such a meal is arranged by the W.V.S. in conjunction with the Council of Social Service. Delivery was taken by the W.V.S. in January of a second meals van, the donors being the City Parochial Foundation. The two vans are now regularly operating in the Borough, the use of the second van, which covers the Eltham and New Eltham areas, being very much appreciated by residents in these areas. Lunch Clubs The Plumstead and Eltham Lunch Clubs operate at the Plumstead Baths and at the Progress Hall, Eltham, respectively, and were open throughout the year. Lunches are also available at the Victorians Club in Sherard Road, -27- Eltham Meals are supplied to the Plumstead Lunch Club by the Borough Council Catering Department, and to the Eltham Lunch Club by a local caterer. During 1959 a contribution of l0d. was made by recipients for each meal, and a subsidy was paid by the County Council of lOd. per meal. At the end Of the year a suggested increase in the cost of the meals to ls.0d. by the recipients and a similar amount by the County Council was being considered. The Borough Council also contribute a substantial grant for the administration of the Lunch Clubs and the Mobile Meals Service in the Borough. Holiday Scheme During the year 105 old people in five parties of 21 spent a week's holiday at Westgate. Three parties went in May and two in September. A number of letters of appreciation have been received by the Council of Social Service who arranged the holidays. The majority of those having a holiday were in receipt of National Assistance and all those who applied and were considered to be in need of a holiday were fitted in. Financial help was given towards the cost of holidays for nine severely handicapped persons, and one deaf and dumb lady, in suitable homes. In almost all these cases the holidays were arranged to coincide with those of the relatives with whom they lived. Domiciliary Chiropody The domiciliary chiropody service for use by old people was introduced in the Borough at the end of 1958 under the auspices of the Council of Social Service. This service supplements the County Council chiropody service. A patient is usually asked to contribute half the cost of each treatment. Home Cleansing Elderly persons who are verminous or feeble and cannot take advantage of the facilities at the public baths may be cleansed in their own homes, and during the year the woman Public Health Inspector arranged home bathing on 75 occasions. It was also necessary from time to time -28- to cleanse and disinfect the living accommodation and household articles. Bathing Facilities at Public Baths The Borough Council arrange for old age pensioners to have hot baths at a reduced charge. Over 5,000 attendances were made by old people at the Council's Baths during the year. Laundering for Aged and Incontinent Under powers contained in the Public Health (London) Act, the Council provides a service for the washing of soiled linen belonging to the aged and incontinent where other arrangements are not reasonably possible. The Disinfecting staff of the Health Department carry out this work and there has recently been a greatly increased demand for this service. There is a collection three times weekly and the number of persons using this service at any one time averages eight. The total number of articles dealt with during the year was 10,493 comprising the following:- Night attire 973; Sheets 4,086; Draw Sheets 1,828; Blankets 183; Pillow cases 583; Towels 1,122; Miscellaneous 1,718. STREET CLEANSING In the Borough there are over 155 miles of roads to be cleansed, of which 15 per cent are swept at least once daily, 20 per cent three to six times weekly, 55 per cent twice weekly and 10 per cent once weekly. Eighty-seven street sweepers are employed on the work, and, in addition, a mechanical sweeper and sprinkler is used to sweep the roads in the shopping areas of Powis Street, Plumstead High Street and Eltham High Street. Approximately 9,500 street gulleys are cleansed periodically by mechanical gulley cleansing machines. -29- HOUSE AND TRADE REFUSE During the year under review, 45,894 tons of refuse were collected by the Council's vehicles and 47,450 tons disposed of at the Council's Refuse Destructor. The difference between the two weights is largely the quantity of refuse delivered to the Refuse Destructor from the Royal Arsenal and from the Army Barracks. Some 1,862 tons of scrap metal, 869 tons of waste paper and 71 tons of textiles were salvaged and 4,770 yards of clinker sold during the year, producing an income of £10,007. PUBLIC CONVENIENCES There are nineteen conveniences for men and a similar number for women within the Borough. In all conveniences the water closets are available without charge. FREE WASHING FACILITIES - PUBLIC CONVENIENCES For the past eight years, the Council has provided free washing facilities at the main public conveniences, including the provision of paper towels, and this service continues to be used to an increasing extent and is much appreciated by the public. However, some members of the public still prefer the paid washing facilities which include the supply of a linen towel. The above information on Street Cleansing, House and Trade Refuse and Public Conveniences has been kindly supplied by the Borough Engineer. BURIALS AND CREMATIONS Under powers contained in the National Assistance Act, arrangements were made by the Health Department during the year for the burial of seven persons who had died or been found dead in the Borough, where it appeared that no other suitable arrangements were being made for their burial. Five were elderly, with no known relatives. The Council's expenses in this work during the year amounted to £103.18.0. of which £81.2.6. has so far been recovered from the Estates of the deceased persons. -30- ELTHAM CREMATORIUM The Eltham crematorium which was built in 1956 on land adjoining the Eltham Cemetery is administered by the Woolwich, Greenwich, and North West Kent Joint Crematorium Committee. This Committee comprises the Boroughs of Woolwich, Greenwich, Bexley, Dartford and Erith and the Urban Districts of Chislehurst and Sidcup and Crayford. During the year the Gravesend Borough Council became the eighth authority to participate in the Joint Crematorium scheme. The number of cremations taking place at this crematorium during the year was 2,377, the greatest number for any year since the crematorium was opened, and,for 1959, more than at any other crematorium in South London. HOUSING REPAIRS At the end of 1959 it was estimated that the total number of dwellings in the Borough was 43,311. The number of premises inspected for housing defects under the Public Health or Housing Acts was 2,605, and 1,066 houses were found to be not in all respects reasonably fit for habitation. The total number of houses rendered fit during the year by informal action was 711. This informal action included the service of 66l intimation notices. In 275 cases it was necessary to serve statutory notices to secure the abatement of the nuisances. House-to-house inspections under the provisions of the Housing (Consolidated) Regulations 1925 totalled 105. OVERCROWDING During the course of the year, seven families were found to be living in overcrowded conditions and reports were made to the Council's Housing Department in respect of these families. Fifty-three families were also visited after complaints of overcrowding or at the request for -31- reports of the County Council or Borough Council's Housing Departments. Where requested to do so, the Council must supply to an owner or tenant of a house information of the number of persons permitted by the standard contained in the Housing Act, 1957, to occupy the dwelling. Ninety-six dwellinghouses were measured during 1959 for this purpose. CERTIFICATES OF DISREPAIR By the Rent Act, 1957, a tenant may apply to the local authority for a Certificate of Disrepair, if, within six weeks of serving a notice on his landlord specifying the defects which in his opinion ought reasonably to be remedied, the defects remain unremedied; or alternatively, if the landlord has failed to give an undertaking to remedy the defects or such of them as the tenant may have agreed as sufficient. Where a landlord has undertaken to remedy defects either following a notice from his1 tenant or following a notice by the Council of their intention to issue a Certificate of Disrepair, then at the end of six months from the date of that undertaking, either landlord or tenant may apply to the Council for a Certificate as to the defects remedied. Details of applications received during the year are shown below :- No.of applications for Certificates of Disrepair 96 No. of applications for Certificates of Disrepair refused 2 No. of notices to landlords of the Council's intention to issue a Certificate of Disrepair 109 No. of undertakings received from landlords,and accepted by the Council 66 No. of Certificates of Disrepair issued 36 No. of Certificates issued to landlords as to the remedying of defects for which the landlord had previously given an undertaking 70 No. of Certificates issued to tenants as to the remedying of defects for which the landlord had previously given an undertaking 25 -32- Fifty-nine applications for cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair were received from landlords or their agents on the grounds that the defects specified on the Certificates had been satisfactorily remedied. In 45 instances it was found that the required repairs had been completed and the applications were accordingly approved. In 14 cases the necessary defects had not been remedied and these applications for cancellation were refused. During the year landlords owning three properties in Eltham appealed to the Woolwich County Court against the Council's refusal to cancel Certificates of Disrepair on these properties. The landlords had objected to the inclusion in the Certificates of items relating to the front gates and fences as being unreasonable, having regard to the age,character, and locality of these houses. The front gates and fences of all the houses in the road concerned and in other neighbouring roads had been removed during a war-time scrap metal drive. At the Hearing, evidence was given that the gates and fences of many of the houses in the neighbourhood which were similar in age and character had been removed and replaced by simple wooden gates and fences of about 2'6" in height. The Court decided that the absence of the front gate and fence constituted an item of disrepair by reason of a defect, and these items ought reasonably to be remedied having regard to the age, character, and locality of the houses concerned. It was accordingly found that it was in each case reasonable to include these items in the Certificate of Disrepair, and therefore the landlords' appeal must fail and be dismissed. However, in the Judgment it was stated that it was not considered that the remedying of these items would necessitate the reinstatement of the front gate and rails as they formerly were, but would be adequately remedied by the erection of a wooden gate and fence similar to those in a neighbouring road, and that if this were done it would be unreasonable for the local authority then to refuse cancellation if such wooden gates and fences were suitably installed. Subsequently the landlords of the properties concerned did erect gates and fences and their further applications for cancellation of the Certificates of Disrepair were approved. -33- IMPROVEMENT GRANTS Under the provisions of the House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, which supplemented the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958, two kinds of monetary grant may be made by the local authority to owner-occupiers, owners of rented houses, and in certain cases to leaseholders, who desire to modernise their property. 1. The existing "Discretionary" Grant scheme is continued under which, up to half the estimated cost of improvements to enable the dwelling to conform to a twelve point standard, may be paid, at the discretion of the local authority, subject to a minimum grant of £50 and a maximum grant of £400. 2. A new "Standard" Grant, under which half the cost, up to a maximum of £155 for carrying out five basic improvements, can be obtained by owners of houses built before 1945 as a right. These five improvements are a fixed bath or shower in a bathroom, a wash-hand basin, a water closet in or contiguous to the dwelling, a hot water supply and satisfactory facilities for storing food. Where a dwelling is already provided with one or more of the five basic amenities, the maximum grant of £155 is reduced by £25 if there is already a bath or shower; by £5 for a wash-hand basin; by £40 for a water closet; by £75 for a hot water supply; and by £10 for a food larder. All applications for improvement grants are submitted to the Borough Treasurer and referred to the Health Department for an inspection to be made to determine whether the proposed work will satisfy the provisions of the standard required by the Act. In the case of applications for "Standard" grants a final inspection is made to ascertain that all the required work has been carried out in a satisfactory manner before payment of the grant is made. During the year, 172 applications for discretionary Improvement grants and 17 applications for standard improvement grants were received and reported upon. In addition 145 visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to advise owners and builders concerning proposed improvement grant schemes. -34- INDIVIDUAL UNFIT HOUSES The following individual unfit houses and parts of houses were represented by me during the year as unfit for human habitation and not capable of being made fit at reasonable expense. Demolition Orders 85 Grangehill Road; 19 Warspite Road. Closing Orders 25 Cantwell Road; 1 Marmadon Road. Closing Orders part of premises) 138 Sandy Hill Road (basement rooms) 25 Tewson Road (basement front and back rooms) 86 Hudson Road (basement back,north living room;basement front,south room) 16 Gavin Street (basement front room) During the year the Council determined Closing Orders in respect of 25 Glenside Road, 42 Raglan Road, 31 Bramblebury Road, 10 Woolwich Common (basement rooms),86 Eltham Road (basement rooms), and 126 Ancona Road (basement back room). The Council agreed to the payment of compensation under Section 17 of the Housing Act, 1957 as fixed by the District Valuer to the owner/occupier of No.l Anglesea Avenue, Woolwich, following the making of a Demolition Order by the Council. CERTIFICATES OF UNFITNESS Under the Housing Subsidies Act, 1956, where a local authority proposes to demolish dwellings which have been purchased by them for clearance purposes, to establish the unfitness of these dwellings the Minister of Housing and Local Government requires a Certificate from the Medical Officer of Health as to the unfitness of the dwellings and also requires the local authority to pass a Resolution that the houses be demolished as unfit. -35- Certificates of Unfitness were issued during the year in respect of the under-mentioned houses- 1 Caroline Place; 66 Beresford Street; 8 Nightingale Vale; l46-l68(even) Woolwich Church Street; 45 Chapel Hill; 2-6(even) 14,16,20 & 22 Samuel Street. SLUM CLEARANCE CLEARANCE AREAS In accordance with the agreed Slum Clearance programme, during the year I represented under Section 42 of the Housing Act, 1957 that the following properties were unfit and should be dealt with by the Council for slum clearance:- (l) St. Mary's Redevelopment Area - Church Hill No. 1 Area Church Hill No. 2 Area Castile Road Area 3-2l(odd) Church Hill 31 & 32 Church Hill 1-5 Castile Road John Wilson Street Area - 46-6o(even), 60a, 62-68(even), 51, 53, 59-87(odd) John Wilson Street; l-8(eons.), 14a, 15-17(cons.) Monk Streets l-13(cons.) Clara Place; 37c, 38-40 (cons.), 42-50(cons.) Castile Road. This Area comprises 77 dwelling houses. Clearance of the above-mentioned properties will almost complete the clearance of the unfit properties in the St. Mary's Area, apart from three small areas in Bowling Green Row, Marshall's Grove, and Woolwich Church Street. (2) Glyndon Redevelopment Area - Southport Road Area - 32-6o(even) Southport Road. -36- Ann Street - Nos, 5,6,7 & ® Areas - In June, 1959 on my representation the Council declared that the undermentioned 162 properties were unfit and should be dealt with as clearance areas. No. 5 Area - 63 & 63a Vicarage Road; 86-126(even), 126a, 128-134(even) Villas Road. No. 6 Area - 37-45(odd), 47-57(odd),Vicarage Road; 36-46(even), 52,58, 62-66(even), 7O & 72, 27-37(odd), 45-75(odd) Villas Road 46-86(even), 86a, 88-102(even), 45-99(odd) Ann Street; 29-37(odd) Walmer Terrace; 38-64(even) Robert Street. No. 7 Area - 5 & 7 Glyndon Road. No. 8 Area - 21-25(cons.) Walmer Terrace. The majority of these properties are about 100 years old. Most of the houses have dampness, together with bulged, fractured walls, leaking roofs and general disrepair. There are 162 houses comprised in these four areas, in which there are some 193 families, comprising approximately 512 persons. (3) Kirkham Street Area - This Area comprises the following 77 unfit properties - 26-64(even), 68, 23-69(odd) Kirkham Street. 18-58(even), 9-29(odd) Ravine Grove. Representation of the above-mentioned areas substantially completes the clearance of properties included in the Council's current five-year programme ending 1960. Future Slum Clearance Areas During the year consideration was given by the Council to its Slum Clearance programme for the third five-year period 1961-1965 which will be fixed in consultation with the County Council. -37- HOUSING PROGRESS The number of dwellings built in the Borough of Woolwich during the year 1959 was as under:- By Borough Council 340 By London County Council 698 By Private Enterprise 151 1,189 In addition, at the end of the year the Borough Council had a further 808 dwellings under construction. In the St. Mary's Comprehensive Development Area, by the end of the year 483 new dwellings had been completed and occupied, together with a doctor's surgery, eight shops, public house and 23 garages. The work of redevelopment proceeded satisfactorily and building has commenced in the Samuel Street/Frances Street area where four 14-storey blocks of flats are included in a scheme of some 279 dwellings. In the Glyndon area where active redevelopment can be anticipated in the near future, the initial rehousings from the sub-standard properties have already been carried out, the occupiers in the main having been rehoused in the new dwellings completed on the Bostall Estate. In addition, a further 97 temporary dwelling tenants have been rehoused, the dwellings themselves having been demolished to make way for permanent housing development. The scheme of 224 small flats in Middle Park Avenue has been completed, and a start made on the building scheme in Strongbow Road. Work has also proceeded at Southend Crescent where the first dwellings were completed and occupied during the year. Approval was received from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government for the scheme of improvement to the older properties in North Woolwich and the work, which includes the provision of bathrooms and modernisation of kitchens, commenced during 1959. By the end of the year such progress had been made in the release of requisitioned properties, that only 21 families remained to be rehoused, and it was apparent at the -38- 31st December that the Council's responsibilities in this matter would be satisfactorily concluded by the 31st March, 1960, the appropriate date under the Act. At the 31st December, 1959 there were 9,336 tenancies in properties owned or controlled by the Council, and at the same date there were 2,785 applicants on the Housing Register, compared with 2,805 a year previously. The information on the housing progress in the Borough during 1959 has been kindly supplied by the Director of Housing. CLEAN AIR Smoke Control Areas The Council have decided to bring the whole of the Borough under Smoke Control as quickly as possible, and the establishment of Smoke Control Areas is proceeding rapidly. At the end of the year there were four Smoke Control Areas in operation and a further five Areas were in various stages towards completion. The following Areas, details of which were reported in my previous Annual Report, are now in operation:- St. Mary's Abbey Wood (Abbey Estate) Abbey Wood Middle Park (North East). Details of the five Areas which are not yet in operation are as follows:- Middle Park (South West) This Area comprises about 100 acres and is bounded by the Dartford Loop Railway line to the south, the rear of Churchbury Road to the west, and Middle Park Avenue to the north and east. There are 722 Borough Council properties, the majority of which are of pre-war construction. -39- The Council's Smoke Control Order was made in October, 1957 and confirmed by the Minister in December, 1958. It is operative on 1st October, 1960. Abbey Wood (No.2) This Area comprises 78 acres, and is bounded to the north by the North Kent Railway line, to the east by the Borough boundary with Erith, to the south by McLeod Road, and to the west by Basildon Road. There are 1,150 dwellings, of which three are Borough Council properties, 119 post-war County Council dwellings, the remainder being private. It is estimated that some 1,000 of these dwellings will require some 1,600 new solid fuel appliances. The Smoke Control Order was made by the Council in July, 1959 and at the end of the year awaited confirmation by the Minister. The operative date of the Order is the 1st October, 1960. Clothworkers Wood This Area comprises 260 acres and is bounded to the south by Shooters Hill, to the east by the Borough boundary with Bexley, Camdale Road, and the boundary wall of the old portion of Woolwich Cemetery, to the north by King's Highway and Heathfield Terrace, to the west by Bassant Road, Swingate Lane, the rear of the south side of Kirkham Street, Erindale, rear of Chelsworth Drive, Garland Road and the Shooters Hill Golf Course. There are 1,868 dwellings, of which 357 are Borough Council properties and 213 post-war County Council dwellings, the remainder being private. It is estimated that approximately 1,500 of these dwellings will require some 2,500 new solid fuel appliances. The Smoke Control Order was made by the Council in July, 1959 and awaited confirmation at the end of the year. The Order comes into operation on the 1st October,1960. Future Areas In October, 1959 the Council decided to proceed with the declaration of two further Areas with a view to the formal declaration in the early summer of 1960, to enable the Orders to become operative in the autumn of 1961. -40- Details of the proposed Areas are as follows:Coldharbour Area This Area is bounded to the south-east, south and south-west by the Borough boundary with Chislehurst and Sidcup, to the north-west and north by the rear of Chapel Farm Road and by a line through the playing fields at the rear of Chapel Farm Road and Sidcup Road, and by Sidcup Road from the Crossways Hotel to the Borough boundary with Chislehurst and Sidcup. It comprises 350 acres, and includes 2,806 dwellings, of which 1,715 are permanent Borough Council post-war properties, and 1,091 private dwellings. It is estimated that approximately 2,300 of these dwellings will require some 3,000 new solid fuel appliances. Abbey Wood (No.3) Area The Area is bounded to the north by the North Kent Railway line, to the east by Eynsham Drive, Basildon Road and Old Park Road (part), east and north-east to meet Bostall Hill, along Bostall Hill to the Borough boundary with Erith, to the east and south by the Borough boundary with Erith and Bexley, to the west by Camdale Road, the eastern boundary of the old portion of Woolwich Cemetery, King's Highway, and by a line across Winn's Common to Grosmont Road/Winn's Common corner, continuing north to meet St. Nicholas Road, along the northern boundary of St. Nicholas Gardens to Church Manorway, north along Church Manorway to the railway line. The proposed Area comprises 380 acres, and includes 1,973 dwellings, of which 1,793 are private. It is estimated that some 1,700 dwellings will require conversion of approximately 2,900 solid fuel appliances. At the end of the year there were approximately 548 acres, and 5,483 dwellings within operative Smoke Control Areas, and a further 1,170 acres and 8,519 properties within Areas in various stages of completion. Details of the size, number of properties and costs of the afore-mentioned Areas, together with the proposed new Areas are set out in Table No. 11 and the accompanying map. -41- TABLE NO. 11 - SMOKE CONTROL AREAS Map Ref.

Although not insisting that approved appliances be installed, the Council has obtained a signed declaration from these owner-occupiers that they are aware of the possible consequences of failure to be equipped to burn all kinds of smokeless fuels. In the Smoke Control Areas already operative conversions in approximately 70 per cent. of private dwellings requiring one or more new appliances have been carried out. Consequently the number of fireplaces converted or adapted has been less than the number estimated at the time of the original survey of the Area, with a consequent reduction in cost. In some instances it was found that there was an aversion to the use of gas as a means of ignition. To facilitate conversions the Council agreed to accept "assignment" of grant direct to contractors. Instead of the residents having to pay the whole cost of the work and then obtain reimbursement from the Council, by the use of this form the applicant pays only his own portion, the remainder being paid direct by the Council to the contractor. Careful watch Is kept by the Council's Smoke Inspectors for the emission of smoke in an operative Smoke Control Area, and, I am pleased to say that, although there are minor infringements during the first few weeks following the operative date, no serious offences have been observed. Publicity Since the implementation of the Clean Air Act the Council has taken a great deal of trouble to ensure that their Smoke Control Areas are introduced with the minimum of upheaval and inconvenience to the residents concerned. Preliminary notification of the Council's proposals are given by letter prior to a visit by the Smoke Inspector. The occupiers are given at least twelve months' notice of the Council's Intention to include their property within a Smoke Control Area. An explanatory booklet is issued to all residents with the preliminary letter. The booklet sets out the main provisions of the Act -44- relating to Smoke Control Areas and gives full information of grant facilities. Considering the magnitude of the task the operation of these Areas has been carried out very smoothly and householders and landlords have co-operated extremely well. The early notification of the Council's intentions enables residents to use up their stocks of coal well before the operative date of the Order. Further letters are sent to all residents at the time the formal Order is made by the Council and also when the Order is confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government. A public meeting is held in each Area, and affords an opportunity to explain the Council's policy and answer questions. Residents are advised on the best use of the authorised smokeless fuels and how to obtain the best results from the appliances they will be fitting. The fuel appliance demonstration hut purchased in 1958 has been in regular use in the Abbey Wood Areas to the end of the year. Numerous enquiries from occupiers of houses in the adjacent Smoke Control Areas have been dealt with. In the hut there were three solid fuel appliances burning coke. The hut was manned by the staff of the Health Department. During 1959 the Council was able to purchase from the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation their Mobile Fuel Demonstration Caravan for use in the Borough. This caravan is being used in Smoke Control Areas and in other Clean Air campaigns of the Council. The caravan demonstrates three solid fuel approved appliances under fire, namely an open fire, a convector open fire and a closed stove burning coke. It also has samples of all the authorised fuels. It is staffed by members of the Health Department. Authorised Fuels The local supply of the proprietary or "premium" authorised fuels has improved recently, and no complaints have been received from residents in Smoke Control Areas of inability to obtain authorised fuel. With the marketing of further varieties of smokeless fuel, residents in Smoke Control Areas have been advised that providing they do not insist upon delivery of only one brand of fuel -45- they should have no difficulty in maintaining an adequate supply throughout the year. Notwithstanding this better supply position of premium fuels the Council has in its plans for Smoke Control Areas continued to rely upon the plentiful supply of coke. Appliances Local retailers appear to have experienced no difficulty in supplying the public with an adequate range of approved open fires. The Council have made available at the demonstration hut, at the Town Hall and at local Libraries, copies of the list of approved appliances. These lists appear to have been well used. New Houses During the year "the Council was informed of the intention by the London County Council to amend the Building By-Laws to ensure that only appliances capable of burning coke, anthracite, gas or electricity were installed in new property. It is anticipated that this By-Law will become operative in 1960. Factory Premises Regular smoke observations are carried out on the chimneys of factories in the Borough. Several complaints were again received from nearby residents of an Abbey Wood factory of fumes and smoke. Extensive work on the plant has been undertaken by the firm concerned, involving the complete redesign of their kilns in relation to the flue system. The plant has been further improved by the installation of an additional cooling system, and other work has also been carried out during the year by the firm at the instigation of the Council. New Furnaces Section 3 of the Clean Air Act requires that new furnaces not used mainly for domestic purposes and exceeding a capacity of 55,000 B.T.U's shall, as far as practicable, be smokeless. Any person installing such a furnace must give prior notice to the Council and may submit detailed plans and specifications for the Council's approval before the work of installation takes place. During 1959 one application for prior approval of plans and specifications was received, and the proposals were -46- investigated in detail by the Department and approved by the Council. The application concerned the proposed installation of new oil burning plant in place of an outof-date solid fuel boiler. In addition, six notifications were received of proposals to alter boiler plant with a maximum rating of less than 55,000 B.T.U's. CLEAN AIR MEASURING STATIONS Two main types of atmospheric pollution measuring stations are being used in the Borough, namely, a standard deposit gauge, and a lead peroxide candle of which there are five in use in the Borough. There are also three daily smoke and sulphur dioxide instruments in regular use. The deposit gauge and lead peroxide instruments give details of the solids falling in the area and the concentration of sulphur dioxide. These results are analysed monthly by the Public Analyst. By means of the daily smoke and sulphur dioxide apparatus the amount of pollution from suspended smoke and the amount of sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere can be estimated. To enable more detailed readings to be taken, particularly where Smoke Control Areas are in operation or proposed, the Council have decided to establish a further nine daily smoke and sulphur dioxide measuring instruments which would give further information on the trend of pollution in a Smoke Control Area. To obtain worthwhile results the instruments need to operate for a number of years to compensate for chance variations, and two instruments are to be used for each area, i.e. one on the windward and the other on the leeward side. The following table gives details of the monthly measurements of deposits of sulphur trioxide and solid matter at the five measuring stations in the Borough during 1959. -47- TABLE NO.12 MEASUREMENT AND RECORDING OP ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION.

Sixty-five visits were made by the Health Education Unit, 18 being to religious groups, six to old people's associations, 11 to political bodies and 30 to other organisations and clubs. Thirty-four sessions were held in the afternoon and 31 in the evening. Individual audiences vary considerably, from 300 at old people's clubs to 20 at some others, but the average audience still remains high. Total attendances at these sessions during the year is estimated at nearly 3,000. Forty-eight of the sessions were devoted exclusively to films, six to talks and eleven to combined talks and films. At the film programmes approximately 30 minutes are devoted to health subjects, followed by a general interest film to complete the hour. Careful consideration is given to the tastes of the organisation concerned and balanced programmes are drawn up in each case with special attention given to any requests made for particular subjects. An increase was noted in requests for talks together with the films, the most popular being on the subject of Clean Air, due no doubt to the Council's activity in this direction. Home Safety was another subject given increased emphasis both in film programmes and talks. Other subjects included "The Work of the Health Department", "Care of the Aged", "Sanitation", "Infectious Diseases", "The Dangers of Smoking", and "Clean Food". Several new organisations were visited by the Health Education Unit and a number of letters of appreciation were received. LEAFLETS AND LITERATURE Leaflets dealing with various public health subjects -49- were widely distributed, including regular circulation for display in General Practitioners' surgeries, in factories, at the Council's libraries and at other public buildings. Posters on a wide range of health subjects are displayed in public places in the Borough. NUISANCE FROM DOGS During the year the Council decided that notices drawing attention to the By-Law dealing with the fouling of pavements by dogs be fixed to lamp posts in selected roads in the Borough. The notices, which are substantially constructed and fitted with aluminium sheet backing with universal clips, are moved frequently from road to road. Several requests have been received for the display of such notices, and it has already been found that these notices serve a useful purpose. Complainants are asked to co-operate with the Council in coming forward with evidence of any contraventions of the Council's By-Laws relating to dog nuisance. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD PREMISES WHERE FOOD IS PREPARED OR OFFERED FOR SALE A total of 1,678 inspections of food premises other than the daily market inspections was carried out by the Food Inspectors during the year. Inspections of registered food premises during the year were as follows:- Dairies 11; Distributors of Milk 198; Ice-cream Premises 390; Premises where meat is potted, pickled, pressed and preserved 160; Premises where Sausages are manufactured 162; Premises where fish is cured or prepared for frying 57; Wholesale dealer in Margarine 2; Restaurants, Cafes and Snack bars 355; Industrial and School Meals Service canteens 225; Markets - Daily; Bakehouses 3; Itinerant Vendors 8; Non-registered Premises 166; Greengrocery and Fish shops 77; Public Houses 236. -50- MILK SUPPLY Within the Borough there were at the end of the year 123 registered distributors of milk and one dairy. The Council also approved registration of a further 27 distributors of milk who sell milk in the Borough from premises outside. A total of 229 dealers' licences and 73 supplementary licences were issued under the provisions of the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1949, which authorise the use of the special designations"Sterilised" "Pasteurised" and "Tuberculin Tested". The percentage of fat content of samples of milk submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical analysis was as follows Fat Content Number of Samples 4.5 per cent, and over 0 4 per cent, and under 4.5 per cent. 7 3.5 per cent, and under 4 per cent. 74 3 per cent, and under 3.5 per cent. 76 Below 3 per cent. 1 Total: 158 In 1959, 206 samples of "Pasteurised" or "Tuberculin Tested" milk were subjected to the Methylene Blue test at the Park Hospital, Hither Green to assess the keeping quality of the milk, and 193 of the samples were reported to be satisfactory. The remaining 13 samples -could not be tested as the shade temperature exceeded 65°F. To determine the adequacy of pasteurisation, 212 samples of "Pasteurised" or "Tuberculin Tested" milk were submitted for the Phosphatase test and were all satisfactory. Twenty-four samples of "Sterilised" or "Tuberculin Tested Sterilised" milk were subjected to the Turbidity test and in each case satisfactory reports were received. The tests referred to above are those prescribed in the Milk (Special Desginations) Regulations, 1949• -51- Continuing the practice carried out for many years in this Borough 30 samples of milk were obtained in the early hours of the morning during deliveries to schools, hospitals and institutions, and submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical analysis. Fifteen samples were submitted for the Phosphatase test and 15 for the Methylene Blue test. Visits to the premises from which milk is distributed were carried out periodically during the year by the Public Health Inspectors. Defects which were found at four premises were subsequently remedied by the owners. ICE-CREAM At the end of the year, there were 323 premises registered by the Council for the sale of ice-cream. Three of these were also registered for the manufacture of ice-cream and four for the storage of ice-cream. The majority of the dealers sell only pre-packed ice-cream. In the course of the year 21 defects were found and nine Informal notices were served on the proprietors of the shops concerned. All the defects were subsequently remedied. Where an application is received for registration of premises for the sale of ice-cream, the premises are first inspected to ensure that they are satisfactory, and the applicant is advised of the requirements relating to ice-cream contained in the Heat Treatment Regulations. During the year, 16 samples of ice-cream were submitted to the Laboratory for grading by the Methylene Blue test, and all the samples were found to be graded within Grade 1. PUBLIC HOUSES The supervision of the hygienic conditions in public houses is carried out by the Public Health Inspectors. There are 131 licensed premises in the Borough, 28 of which serve main meals. During the year 136 inspections were made and as a result one formal notice and eleven informal notices were issued to secure the remedying of the defects found. -52- Excellent co-operation continues to exist between the various brewery companies and Officers of the Department, and this has resulted in the maintenance of a high standard of hygiene in both premises and equipment.. FOOD SAMPLING, 1959 During the year ended 31st December, 1959, 844 samples of food and drugs (being 675 informal and 169 formal samples) were submitted for analysis to the Public Analyst. Of these 35 informal samples and two formal samples were reported to be adulterated or otherwise not complying with the statutory requirements, giving a percentage of 4.3 compared with 3.2 in 1958. No private samples were examined during the year. The following table gives details of the adulterated samples TABLE NO. 13 Sample Article Formal or Informal (F or I) Adulteration or Irregularity 576 Cochineal Colouring I Incorrectly labelled. 631 "Pepsi Cola" I Bottle contained half a cigarette packet and a few particles of shredded tobacco. 590 Mixed Fruit I Insufficiently labelled - ingredients not specified. 755 Mixed Fruit I ft 595 Minced chicken in jelly.

UNSOUND FOOD : EXAMINATION During the year altogether 30,230 articles of food, weighing approximately 60 tons, were condemned in the Borough as unfit for human consumption. The majority of -56- this unsound food, weighing approximately 50 tons, was from the large Abattoir. COMPLAINTS OF UNSOUND FOOD In 1959 the Council instituted legal proceedings in respect of the following complaints of unsound food:- Bottle of mineral water containing half a cigarette packet. Fined 40/-. £6.6.0. costs. Dirty milk bottle - Fined £3.0.0. Bottle of Lemonade contaminated with petrol. Adjourned Sine Die. Sale of mouldy Cornish Pasty - Fined £5.0.0. £5.5.0. costs. Mouldy Bridge Pies - Proceedings pending. The Council sent a warning letter to the persons responsible for the sale of a bun containing a wire nail, and decided to take no further action in respect of a complaint of a currant bun alleged to contain a pin. Other complaints received during the year related to food alleged to contain maggots (seven instances); food alleged to contain mould (ten cases); and 14 instances of food alleged to contain foreign matter, including glass, metal, pins, and insects. In several of these complaints the fodd was perfectly sound. "Paper" in a doughnut was found to be part of a polythene film used to enclose lard. A number of complaints were also received concerning alleged unsound meat, including chicken and bacon, and two complaints of contaminated milk. Where the complaint was substantiated the shopkeeper's premises and stock were inspected and the shopkeeper advised. MEAT INSPECTION Details of the carcases inspected at the Garland Road Abattoir during 1959 are as follows:- -57 TABLE NO. 14 Carcases & Offal Inspected and Condemned in Whole or In Part, 1959 Cattle excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Goats Number killed and Inspected. 8,294 2 2,385 25,566 24,971 7 All diseases (except Tuberculosis and Cysticerci) Whole carcases condemned. - - 4 13 51 - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned. 4,252 - 3 2,090 4,157 Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than tuberculosis and cysticerci. 51.2 - .29 8.2 16.8 Tuberculosis only Whole carcases condemned 7 - - - - - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned. 410 - - - 459 - Percentage of the number inspected affected with tuberculosis. 5.2 - - - 1.8 - Cysticercosis Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned and treated by refrigeration. 74 - - 1 - - -58- LICENSING OF SLAUGHTERHOUSES AND SLAUGHTERMEN There is now only one licensed slaughterhouse in the Borough - the Garland Road Abattoir, at which over 51,000 carcases were inspected by the Council's Meat Inspectors during the year. Twelve slaughtermen's licences were issued by the Council during the year. Two were to serving soldiers attached to the Barracks, and the remainder to men working at the Garland Road Abattoir. SLAUGHTERHOUSE FACILITIES IN THE BOROUGH Under the Slaughterhouse (Hygiene) Regulations, and the Slaughtering of Animals (Prevention of Cruelty) Regulations, as applied to the London area, the Council are required to carry out a review of slaughterhouse facilities in the Borough, and to estimate the probable future requirements In the district for slaughterhouse facilities, and the facilities available or likely to become available to meet those requirements. In view of the fact that the full slaughtering capacity at the Garland Road Abattoir is not at present used and after consultation with the meat trade and other interests concerned, the Council decided that it is unlikely that lany requirement of the present or foreseeable future could not be met at this Abattoir. The owners have given an assurance'that they will be prepared to contract with any local butcher for the private slaughtering of beasts as and when required. In these circumstances the Council consider that the present slaughtering facilities in the Borough are reasonable and adequate. At the end of the year the Council decided to recommend the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food that the date for the coming into force of the Hygiene Regulations in the Borough should be the 1st October, 1960. -59- PREVALENCE AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE The following diseases are compulsorily notifiable in the Borough Anthrax, Cholera, Diphtheria, Dysentery, Encephalitis (Acute), Erysipelas, Enteric Fever, Food Poisoning, Glanders, Hydrophobia, Leprosy, Malaria, Measles, Membranous Croup, Meningococcal Infection,Ophthalmia Neonatorum, Pneumonia (Acute Primary), Pneumonia (Acute Influenzal), Poliomyelitis, Polio-encephalitis, Plague, Puerperal Pyrexia, Relapsing Fever, Scabies, Scarlet Fever (or Scarlatina), Smallpox, Tuberculosis (all forms), Typhoid Fever (including Paratyphoid), Typhus Fever, Whooping Cough, and Zymotic Enteritis. Cases of infectious disease notified to the Department are immediately visited by the Public Health Inspectors and disinfection is carried out wherever applicable. Where the patient is nursed at home, Public Health Inspectors visit to see that home isolation is carried out satisfactorily, and at the end of the infectious period, where necessary, the bedding belonging to the patient is removed for treatment at the Disinfecting Station and the rooms sealed and fumigated. The total number of notifiable infectious diseases occurring in the Borough was 2,333 (compared with 864 in the previous year), of which 1,801 were notifications of measles. DIPHTHERIA Once again there were no confirmed cases of diphtheria in the Borough. POLIOMYELITIS The only case of confirmed poliomyelitis, which was non-paralytic, concerned a four-year old girl who had not been immunised. Nine other notifications of suspected cases were received. All patients were admitted to hospital for observation and revised diagnoses were: Pneumonia 2; Septicemia 2; Influenza; Respiratory Infection; Tonsillitis; Nervous Disability; and Pyrexia of unknown origin. -60- Immunisation against poliomyelitis was continued throughout the year by the County Council, and with the improvement in the supply of vaccine local publicity for vaccination was intensified. DYSENTERY Notified cases of Dysentery totalled 76, a large increase on the previous year, and occupied the Department's attention throughout the year. Thirty-six of the notified cases concerned children under 10 years of age. Most of the cases were of a mild type. The infection was found to persist for a long time in a number of cases despite repeated treatment in hospital. Routine testing of other members of the family in addition to the notified cases was carried out. SALMONELLA INFECTION An outbreak of Salmonella Infection occurred at the British Hospital, Woolwich, in June involving mainly the premature baby unit. There were 15 notified cases of mothers and premature babies, and there were two deaths of premature babies. The majority of the mothers affected were residents of the Woolwich and Greenwich areas. Mothers who had had their babies were discharged immediately. Despite a thorough check on all patients, staff at the hospital, buildings and equipment, it became necessary to close the hospital, but owing to the energetic efforts of all concerned the hospital was reopened with the minimum of delay. Complete disinfection of the premises and of the bedding and blankets was carried out by the staff of the Health Department. PNEUMONIA Increased notifications of Acute Primary and Acute Influenzal Pneumonia were received, notifications totalling 140 during the year. The number of deaths from Pneumonia (all forms) was 128. -61- TABLE NO. 15 NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES (EXCLUDING TUBERCULOSIS), 1959 Under 1 year 1-4 years 5-9 years 10-14 years 15-34 years 35-44 years 45-64 years 65 and over Age unknown Total Total No. admitted to Hospital.

At the special survey held in Powis Street, Woolwich, during the year some 11,000 persons were x-rayed, and nearly 4,000 employees of Woolwich Arsenal were x-rayed during April. The unit also visited a number of other local factories. The great majority of those x-rayed were men, special attention being paid to men over 45 years of age for lung cancer. Six-monthly visits are being made to a number of local factories for this purpose. At the end of the year arrangements were also in hand for the unit to make regular visits to central Woolwich on one day each fortnight. DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION Following notification of infectious disease 113 rooms were disinfected by the Department during 1959. Of this -64- number 26 rooms had been occupied by tuberculous patients. The Public Health Inspectors made 762 visits in connection with verminous conditions, and as a result of these inspections it was found necessary to disinfest 349 rooms of vermin. Many requests from residents in the Borough to remove and destroy old and unwanted furniture and furnishings were received. The articles to be destroyed were mainly dirty and verminous. The items which were collected and later destroyed at the Plumstead Destructor included 14 mattresses, 16 bedsteads, 21 sets of bedding, 42 pieces of furniture,and 50 sundry items. A local firm which specialises in rag and other waste wipers periodically requires the issue of a Certificate of Hygiene to the effect that a consignment of rags has been efficiently washed and sterilized. This particularly applies when the rags are for export. Seven such Certificates were Issued to this Company during the year, for which a small charge was made. AUTHENTICATION OF CERTIFICATES OF VACCINATION Persons proceeding abroad are required to produce in certain countries evidence of recent successful vaccination or inoculation. The signatures on these certificates are not acceptable by the countries concerned unless authenticated by the Medical Officer of Health as being the bona fide signature of a Dootor practising within the area. During the year 564 Certificates were authenticated by me, 546 relating to protection against smallpox, 12 for cholera, and six for typhoid fever. PERSONAL CLEANSING The Borough Council maintains two personal cleansing stations, one being at Plumstead (adjoining the Turkish Baths, Plumstead High Street), and the other at the Lionel Road Centre, Eltham. The number of persons cleansed in 1959 was 1086, and the number treated for scabies was 69. -65- LABORATORY FACILITIES A large part of the Council's pathological and allied work in relation to the diagnosis, prevention and control of infectious diseases is undertaken at the Southern Group Laboratory at the Hither Green Hospital, Lewisham.
