To the Vestry of St, Martin-in-the-Fields. Gentlemen, 1 have the honour of submitting to you my Twentysixth Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Parish. Births. Luring the year the Births registered numbered 189, a number the lowest of the last ten years. F 2 84 The following Table gives the number of Births registered in each month of the year :— Malel. Females. Total.

In London, during the year 1895, the birth-rate was 30.5 per 1,000 of the estimated population. Deaths. The total Deaths occurring during the year in the Parish were 367, an excess of 26 over the previous year, 1894. 85 The following Table gives the number of Deaths registered in each month of the year 1895 :— Males.

On referring to Table 7, it will at once make clear what I have just stated. In estimating the Death-rate, I do so in two forms, the first in which are excluded 17 deaths of aged parishioners occurring in Edmonton Workhouse and 1 at St. Martin's Almshouses, Camden Town, they having been resident in these Institutions many years prior to their death, and in the second I have included them. Death-rate of St. Martin-in-the-Pields for the year 1895, excluding 17 deaths of aged parishioners occurring in the Edmonton Workhouse and 1 in St. Martin's Almshouses 15.2 per 1,000 of the estimated population. 86 Death-rate of St. Martin-in-the-Fields for the year 1895, including the 17 deaths of aged persons occurring in the Edmonton Workhouse, and 1 in St. Martin's Almshouses 16.5 per 1,000 of the estimated population. In London the death-rate for the year 1895 was 19.8 per 1,000 persons living. Infantile Mortality. Of the 240 deaths of parishioners occurring within and out of the Parish, 76, or 31.7 per cent., occurred in children under 5 years of age. Old Age Mortality. The deaths of parishioners over 60 years of age, occurring within and out of the Parish, numbered 70. 27 were from 60 to 70 years of age. 28 „ „ 70 „ 80 „ „ 13 „ „ 80 „ 90 „ „ 2 „ „ 90 „ 100 „ „ Causes of Death. Zymotic Diseases.—The principal Zymotic Diseases are Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Typhoid Fever, Typhus Fever, Puerperal Fever, Cholera, and Diarrhoea. The number of deaths occurring in the Parish from this class of disease was 40. This number includes those nonparishioners who died in the Charing Cross Hospital. After deducting these, and adding those parishioners who died in Public Institutions outside the Parish, the mortality due to St. Martin's would be 22. Vide Table 5. 87 Small-Pox.—This complaint was very prevalent in the Metropolis during the latter half of the year, more especially at the end of July and during the month of August. Three cases were notified, in accordance with the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, as occurring in St. Martin-in-the-Fields, one of which resulted in death. One of the cases notified was that of a man who had been discharged from the Wandsworth Prison on the morning of the 31st July, and in the afternoon of the same day he was found wandering about the Strand with the small-pox eruption fully out upon him. Measles.—Four deaths were recorded from this malady, two of which occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, and were nonparishioners. Scarlet Fever.—One death from this disease occurred in the Parish, and one of a parishioner in the Western Fever Hospital, Seagrave Road, Fulham. The number of cases notified during the year was 42, against 21 of the previous year, 1894. Diphtheria.—The deaths in the Parish from this disease during the year numbered 15, of which 11 were those of nonparishioners, and in addition 3 deaths of parishioners occurred in Public Institutions outside the Parish. Whooping Cough.—From this complaint 7 deaths were recorded, one of which occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, and was that of a non-parishioner. Typhoid Fever.—Ten deaths, all non-parishioners, occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, and a parishioner died in a private hospital outside the Parish. Typhus Fever.—No death was recorded from this malady. Puerperal Fever.—No death was recorded from this malady. Cholera.—Nil. 88 Diarrhcea.—Three deaths from infantile Diarrhoea were recorded. The deaths from all causes, with the ages at death of those who died in the Parish, and also of those parishioners who died in public institutions outside the district will be found fully detailed in Tables 2 and 6. Inquests. During the year 1895 inquests were held in the Parish in reference to the deaths of 54 persons, of whom 12 were residents, and also 5 inquests were held respecting the deaths of parishioners outside the Parish. The causes which produced death were as follows:— Natural causes 19 Pistol Shot Wound (suicide) 2 Drowning 5 Hanging (suicide) 1 Poison, prussic acid (suicide) 1 ,, chloride of zinc (suicide) 1 „ opium (self-administered by 1 4 mistake) „ irritant (no evidence to show 1 how administered) Suffocation (infant) from paper impacted in throat 1 Newly-born children found dead in public places 3 Injuries received from being run over by cabs 5 „ „ „ fall from roof of a piece of iron gutter 1 Injuries received from being thrown from a carriage, the horses having run away 1 Injuries received from a fall down stairs 1 ,, „ „ „ from window into street 3 89 Inquests—continued.

During the year the number of cases of infectious disease notified as occurring in the Parish, was 85 as against 71 of the previous year, 1894. On referring to Table 9 the comparison of these two years can be seen at a glance. The fees paid to the Medical Practitioners for forwarding the certificates of these 85 cases amounted to £9 11s., which sum is repaid to your Vestry by the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. In the latter months of the year a difficulty was experienced in procuring isolation for Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever cases, owing to the inability of the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board to provide accommodation. This deadlock in the machinery of the Metropolitan Asylums Board caused a considerable amount of anxiety, for some of the cases occurred amongst our poorer parishioners, whose means of providing isolation are very imperfect. On the 11th July the following letter on the above subject was addressed to your Vestry Clerk by Mr.T.Duncombe Mann, Clerk to the Metropolitan Asylums Board: — The Metropolitan Asylums Board, Norfolk House, Norfolk Street, 11 July, 1895. Dear Sir, Hospital accommodation for Fever Patients. I regret to inform you that the available accommodation at the Hospitals of this Board for patients suffering from Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria is nearly exhausted, and that new cases can only be admitted as vacancies are occasioned by discharges and deaths. I have, therefore, to express the hope that instructions may be given by your Board (or Vestry) to the Officers concerned, to arrange for preference being given to the removal to the Board's Hospitals of those patients who, as a consequence of their surroundings and conditions of life, are most in need of Hospital treatment. I am also to ask your Board (or Vestry) to be good enough to instruct all Officers, who make applications for the removal of patients, to ascertain whether their requests are complied with or not, and when they have not been complied with, to repeat their applications day by day so long as their patients continue in a fit condition for removal and until the removal is effected, and to add a statement of the circumstances which render the removal of the cases urgent. Yours faithfully, T. DUNCOMBE MANN, Clerh to the Board. To— G. W. Murnane, Esq., The Clerk to the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. 90 91 In my fortnightly report addressed to you on the 8th August, when Small Pox was so prevalent in the Metropolis, I pointed out the precautions that were adopted in the Parish against the spread of this disease, which also applied to any other infectious complaint, as follows:— "On receiving intimation of a case of Small-pox the house is at once visited, and immediate measures are taken for the removal of the patient to hospital by telephoning to the Asylums Board for the service of the ambulance, at the same time a telegram is sent to your Disinfector to come and disinfect the rooms occupied by the patient, and also to remove the bedding for disinfection. Any children living in the house, and who attend school, the parents are warned against sending them, and a certificate is forwarded to the head teacher of the school, informing him or her of the presence of the disease in the said premises, and if there are any person or persons living in the house employed at a tailor's, dressmaker's, laundry, dairy, &c., I write to their employers, drawing their attention to the fact of the existence of infectious disease therein. I recommend vaccination to the inmates of an infected house, but my advice is rarely taken, owing, I presume, to the objection which has sprung up within the last few years in respect of vaccination. Disinfectants are given to those who are unable to purchase them. Also a copy of the Medical Practitioner's certificate notifying the case is forwarded to the Clerk of the Metropolitan Asylums Board within twelve hours of its receipt. I can confidently assert that there is no sanitary district in London which acts with greater promptitude in cases of infectious disease than ours; people living in the house wherein a case has occurred have frequently remarked on our expeditious procedure. I may inform you that in no house wherein a case of Small-pox has occurred has there ever been a recurrence of the disease; this clearly shows the means we adopt are satisfactory and efficient." Disinfection afteR Infectious Disease. During- the year 64 rooms, and two wards of the Royal Westminster Ophthalmic Hospital, were disinfected, and the bedding, &c., of 24 rooms were removed for the purpose of purifying- by means of steam, at a cost of £85 14s. 11 d. The disinfections, as hitherto, are done by Mr. W. G. Lacy, who has extensive and model premises for the purpose at St. John's Wharf, Town Mead Road, Fulham, and who carries them out with the greatest promptitude and care. The House to House Inspection. This work, though not completed, is still in course of progress. The unforeseen difficulties encountered have been very numerous, but notwithstanding, the amount of drainage works already carried out in the Parish has been very considerable, and I may add very costly. Some of the difficulties were, the unwillingness of many of the parishioners to do the works ordered, due, in many cases, to the want of pecuniary means; difficulty of finding who was the responsible party to do the work; construction of the new sewerage works in the Adelphi area and Strand; the resignation of the Sanitary Inspectors; and lastly the number of new houses erected, and still in course of erection, all the drainage works of which have to be superintended by your Sanitary Inspector during the process of construction. When one takes into consideration the large amount of work that has been done, and resorting so rarely to legal proceedings, I think we may congratulate ourselves on so happy a result. Appended is a list of those premises where notices and plans have been sent in of intention to lay down new drains since the commencement of this inspection down to the end of February, 1806. 92 93 Adelaide Street, No. 1.

In one of them—recently constructed—I considered the position of the water-closet was not sufficiently separated from the bakehouse, and at my suggestion the owner very willingly consented to put up a partition, thereby preventing direct communication between the bake-house and water-closet, a lobby intervening. For the future, in accordance with the Factory and Workshop Act, 1895, all newly-constructed bake-houses will not be permitted underground. The Act says in sub-section 3 of section 27 : "A place underground shall not be used as a bakehouse unless it is so used at the commencement of this Act, and if any place is so used in contravention of this Act it shall be deemed to be a workshop not kept in conformity with the principal Act." Laundries have been inspected, also the workshops, where known to exist. 96 Food and Drugs Act. Your Analyst, Mr. Percy A. E. Richards, has had submitted to him 39 samples for examination under the above Act during the year. With the exception of 4 they were all found genuine. In two of the adulterated cases summonses were taken out against the vendors, but on the hearing before the Magistrate they were both dismissed upon technical points. The other two vendors were simply cautioned by your Clerk, the adulteration not being sufficient to warrant a prosecution. The samples were as follows :— Milk 9 samples. Genuine except 1. Butter 3 „ Genuine. Bread 3 „ „ Tea 3 „ „ Coffee 3 „ „ Cocoa 3„ „ Mustard 3 „ „ Whisky 9 „ „ except 2, Gin 3 ,, „ „ 1. Sanitary Notices. Sanitary notices in reference to 215 houses have been served upon the owners or occupiers of same. In four cases summonses had to be resorted to, to compel the owners or occupiers to conform to the notices served ; in three of these the works were carried out prior to the day of hearing before the Magistrate, and in the fourth case the summons was withdrawn on the ground that the owner was instituting proceedings for ejectment against the tenant, the former undertaking to see that the sanitary work was carried out so soon as he obtained possession of the premises. 97 Houses Let Out in Lodgings. Your Sanitary Inspector, whom you appointed permanently to inspect these houses, has regularly carried out this duty, and has reported to me all sanitary defects coming under his notice. I have the honour to be, Gentj.emen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN J. SKEGG, Medical Officer of Health. 29, Graven Street, March, 1396. 98 TABLE I.
