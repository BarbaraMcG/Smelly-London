WEIGHT, Secretary to the Hoard. REPORT TO Thc Board of Works for the FewishamDistrict TO THE END OF THE YEAR, 1880. By F. EACHUS WILKINSON M.D., &c„ Medical OJficcr of Health for the District. Gentlemen, The population of the Lewisham District estimated to the middle of the year 1880 amounted to 67,465 residing in " ' 10,970 houses. Table I. gives the estimated population, the number of inhabited houses, and the births, deaths, and marriages which have taken place in the District during the year 1880 and the 10 previous years. Table II. gives the annual rate of mortality, death rates amongst children, and death rates at the public institutions in the District. Table III. gives the deaths registered at several groups of ages from different causes during the year. Table IV. gives the mortality from certain classes of diseases, and the proportion to population, and to 1,000 deaths in 1880. Table V. gives the number of deaths in the 10 years, 1K70 to 1ST?) inclusive, from the seven principal zymotic diseases, and the number in the year 1880. Table VI. gives the Inspectors' Reports of the sanitary work completed during the year. Table VII. gives the number o! inhabited houses, the 2 estimated population in 1880, with the birth and death rate in the Registrar's Sub-districts in the Lewisham Parish, and the Hamlet of Penge, together comprising "the Lewisham District." Table VIII. gives the area, the census population in the years 1861 and 1871, the estimated population in 1880, and the mortality in various Metropolitan Districts, and in England and Wales, &c. Table IX. gives the population, the number of persons to an acre of ground, the number of births and deaths, the annual birth and death rates, the mean temperature and rainfall in London and 22 large towns of the United Kingdom, and in the Lewisham District. Table X. The number of children between the ages of 3 and 13 years attending public elementary and certified efficient schools in the Parish of Lewisham and in the Hamlet of Penge during the year 1880. Table XI. A Register of the licensed cow-houses in the District, together with a list of the milk sellers in the District who have no licenses. Table XII. A list of the licensed slaughter-houses in the District. Marriages. Dining the year 1880, 307 Marriages took place in the Parish of Lewisham, of which 267 were solemnized in the several Church of England Churches, 24 in Dissenting Chapels, and 16 at the Registrar's Office. one hundred and twenty-seven Marriages took place in the Hamlet of Penge, of which 105 were solemnized in Church of England Churches, 13 in Dissenting Chapels, and 9 at the Registrar's Office. 3 Births. The Registered Births in the District in the year 1880 amounted to 2,127. Males, 1,106. Females, 1,021. The Birth Rate to population was 31.52 per 1,000. In London 132,173 births were registered, the annual Birth Rate being 36.2 per 1,000 In England and Wales 880,020 were registered, the annual Birth Rate being 34.6 per 1,000. The natural increase of population by excess of births over deaths in the Lewisham district was 107.3. Deaths. The number of deaths registered in the Lewisham District during the year 1880, was 1,054, being 91 in excess of the number registered during the previous year. The annual rate of mortality per 1,000 was 15.02. The annual rate of mortality of England and Wales in the year 1880 was 20 7. In the Metropolitan and City Police districts 21.0. In Registration London 22.2, and in the district outside Registration London 10.2 per 1,000. By reference to Table III., which gives the mortality registered at several groups of ages, it will be seen that of the 1,054 deaths registered from all causes in 1880 ; 442 died under the age of 5 years, of which number 301 deaths occurred under 1 year of age. 301 deaths occurred under 1 year of age. 86 between the ages of 1 and 2 55 „ „ 2 and 50 59 „ „ „ 5 „ 15 4 49 between the ages of 15 and 25 55 „ „ 25 „ 35 70 „ „ 35 „ 45 72 „ „ 45 „ 55 80 „ „ 55 „ 65 115 „ „ 65 „ 75 86 „ „ 75 „ 85 26 „ „ 85 „ 95 2 „ „ 95 and upwards.

"Water Supply. With regard to Water Supply, the important question lor the Sanitary Authority is not only its sufficient quantity, and its proper filtration and purity, before distribution, but to see that the cisterns for storing water arc placed in accessible situations, in order that they may be readily and frequently cleansed, and to see that no contamination takes place from any connection with the water closet, or between the overflow pipe of the cistern and the drain. The Hoard of Trade Regulations, 1872, relative to waste pipes, provide that no overflow or waste pipe, other than a earning pipe, shall be attached to any cistern supplied with water by a company. Sewer Gases. Continued watchful care is required to prevent the ingress air, the product of sewer putrefaction fer- 5 mentation into dwellings. Houses are constantly found which communicate with drains by waste pipes, soil pipes constructed within the house, cesspools, drains, and at times overflow pipes, sink pipes, bath pipes, and lavatory basin pipes, and although supposed to be secured by traps, fail to keep out poisonous gases laden with the germs of infection. A great deal of trouble has been taken to get these dangers prevented in the construction of new houses in the district, but constant supervision is requisite. No soil pipe should be constructed within a house, and should always be ventilated, and no house should, by means of drains, in any way communicate with a sewer, but should have its connection broken between the house and drain traps and terminate by a free end into the open air outside the house. Cow Houses and Dairies. As milk often constitutes the sole diet of infants and invalids, it becomes of the most serious importance that this nutritious food should be of a pure quality The surroundings of cow houses and dairies should be kept scrupulously clean, and in the event of any case of sickness amongst the cows, the animal should be kept separate from others, and the milk from the diseased animal thrown away. The attendance upon cows by those who have recently been the subject of epidemic diseases, should be forbidden. The water used for the washing of cans must also be of a pure description, and not drawn from a dirty cistern 01 well. The requirements for cow-houses arc, that-here must be a cubic space of 800 feet for each cow ; the sides and floor- 6 ing of the cow house must be of some solid and impervious material; there must be proper light and ventilation ; proper paving and drainage of the cow house and adjoining yard ; a good water supply; a properly constructed dung pit; and a clean, covered, impervious receptacle for grains. The cow houses must be cleansed, and the manure removed therefrom, twice daily; and all refuse removed from the premises at least three times a week before 7 a.m. The Board's Hospital. The Hospital for the reception of patients suffering from epidemic disease is now the freehold property of the Board of Works of the Lewisham District, and the new building is now completed. It is well situated, being in a locality far away from inhabited houses and at a good elevation, and has a resident nurse ready for the reception of patients. Ambulances are kept at Lcwisham and Penge for the conveyance of patients suffering from infectious disease. The importance of this establishment cannot be overestimated, lor whenever a case of epidemic disease is removed in order to prevent its communication to others, it confers a benefit to the general public. on this ground the payment for the maintenance and medical attendance should be as low as possible to the friends of the patient. In accordance with this view, by a Resolution of the Board, dated 23rd June, 1880, the payment was fixed at one guinea per week; such charge to include maintenance and medical attendance The charge for the ambulance is only the actual cost incurred in each case for horse hire. 7 Disinfection. One disinfecting apparatus, for the purpose of disinfecting the wearing apparel, bedding, &c., of those who have suffered from epidemic disease, is placed at Lewisham, and another at Penge. Covered iron carts are in readiness to fetch and deliver apparel, &c. Latrines The establishment of Latrines in the district has been under consideration. Baths and "Wash-houses. The establishment of I Baths and Wash-houses in the different divisions of the district is also of great importance, but whether it should be taken up by the Board, or by a public company formed for the purpose, is a matter of opinion. 1 have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. E. WILKINSON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health to the Lewisham District. 8 TABLE I. Population, Inhabited Houses, Births, Deaths, and Marriages. (gross numbers).

SURVEYOR'S REPORT Of work executed from Lady-day, 1880, to Lady-day, 1881. Gentlemen, It is with much pleasure I submit this, my Twelfth Annual Report upon the works, &c., carried out in my department. HIGHWAYS. The following table gives the quantities of material used during the year. Divsion. Granite. Port Philip Stone. Dug Flints. Gravel. Total. Lewisham Parish, cubic yards 4562 250 2100 1640 8552 Penge, ditto 527 ... 880 640 2047 Total 5089 250 2980 2280 10599 There was a less quantity of material used this year than last. I consider the Roads, upon the whole, are in good condition, hut I am anxious they should not be allowed to deteriorate, as with an increasing traffic it will not be true economy to let them do so. Probably the most important matter affecting the Highways during the year, was the determination of the Board to substitute granite for Port Philip stone, there being so little difference between the tenders (Min., 14th April, Page 9). There was frost for six weeks in December and January, and during that time about 550 loads of ashes, &c., were spread upon the Roads to afford foothold for horses, &c. I may say this is a new item of expense The rainfall from the 26th March, 1880 to the 25th March, 1881 (inclusive), as given by the rain guage at the Forest Hill stoneyard was as follows:— 2 No. of days on which rain fell INCHES DEC. 1 1880. March 26th to 81st (inclusive) 0.08 10 April 2.17 6 May 0.41 16 June 1.94 17 July 2.03 6 August 0.07 12 September 2.64 18 October 0.85 10 November 1.54 17 December 2.63 4 1881. January, snow storm on the 18th 0.72 16 February 2.30 8 March to the 25th (inclusive) 1.40 141 26.28 Rain fell upon 1 11 days. There was 139 inches more ram this year than in the corresponding period last year. An unusually large quantity of rain fell during the month of October. July is said to be the wettest month of the year, and October one of the driest. Upon the 18th and 10th of January the heaviest fall of snow took place that I have seen in the District. Traffic was suspended for some time upon the North and Mid Kent Railways. Early upon the morning of the 10th 1 had to send a squad of men to dig out some vans that were snowed up upon Bromley Hill. In Hither Green Lane drifts extended from Lannier Road to the Southend Road, varying in depth from 2 feet to 7 feet. In one drift I had to remove 5,000 cubic yards of snow before the road could be made available for traffic. The drifts upon Blackheath wore also deep, and throughout the district traffic was suspended for a short time. Every exertion was made to clear away the snow, and I had as many as 172 men working upon t he Roads in addition to the usual staff. Two rough snow Ploughs, were used and a number of extra horses and carts. I do not think less than 176,000 cubic yards of snow could have fallen upon the public roads and footpaths during the storm. ROAD WATERING. The work of Watering the Blackheath Roads and the greater Portion of the Lewisliam Roads was done by the Board's horses. Mr. Lane, of Rushey Green, contracted to supply horses and 3 men for 8s. per day each horse, &c., to do the work of watering the remaining portion of the roads. In Sydenham and Forest Hill Mr. Stimpson supplied horses, harness, and men at 9s. per day for each horse; and in Lower Sydenham Mr. Craker did the the work for 9s. per day for each horse, &c., In the Hamlet of Penge Mr. Winnifrith obtained the contract at 8s. 3d. per day for each horse, harness, and man. The Greenwich Boundary Roads were watered by agreement with the Greenwich Board of Works, and Sydenham Hill by arrangement with the Camberwell Vestry. About two miles of Road were also watered in Beckenham Parish, the Beckenham Parish paying the cost. LIGHTING. In the Parish of Lewisham there are at present 582 lamps lighted by the South Metropolitan Gas Company, and 031 lighted by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company. During the year the Phænix Gas Company became amalgamated with the South Metropolitan Gas Company. In the Hamlet of Penge there are 880 lamps, lighted by the Crystal Palace Gas Company. An important reduction in the cost of supplying the lamps with gas, &c., took place during the year. The South Metropolitan Gas Company reduced the price per lamp per annum from £ 4 5s. to £3 17s., and subject to a discount of per cent. if the bills were paid within one month from the date of the delivery of the same. The Crystal Palace Gas Company reduced their prices from £4 8s. 4d. to £4 1s. l0d. per lamp per annum, and also subject to the same discount. This will be a saving of about £615 per annum. The indices of the meter lamps were read. In Lewisham there were 22 lamps removed, and in the Hamlet of Penge 8. The following list will give the new lamps put up during the year:— Lewisham. Allenby Road 3 Beechfield Road 1 Bowness Road 1 Brandon Road 2 Brownhill Road 7 Canonbie Road 1 Church Road 1 Cranston Road 1 4 Dacre's Road 1 Drinking Fountain, Blackheath 1 Elswick Road 2 Engleheart Road 1 Ensoll Street 1 Garlies Road 3 Glenwood Road 1 Grote's Buildings 1 John Street 1 Kemble Road 1 Panmure Road 1 Plassy Road 2 Queen's Road 1 Ringstead Road 1 Venner Road 5 Wemyss Road 1 Willow Grove 1 Woolstone Road 1 Trewsbury Road 2 45 Penge.

In the Parish of Lewisham the Dust and Ashes were collected by horses and carts belonging to the Board, the Dust, &c., being disposed of to Mr. Stumps, Loampit Vale, Mr. Phillips, Ladywell Farm, and Mr. Lane, George Lane. The Hamlet of Penge was divided into two Districts, and the Dust, &c., sold to Messrs. Featherby and Co., Elmer's End Lane, and Messrs. Rhodes and Cooper, Kent House Lane Brickfields. Mr. Winnifrith supplied horses and carts for collecting the Dust, &c., at 8s. 3d. per day. The Board employed and paid the men and boys. The Dust, &c., in Lewisham, was sold for £396 0s. 10d., and in Penge for £246 18s. for the year, these sums being the receipts during the year. 5 BOARD'S HORSES.

The construction of this Sewer will supply a want lon^ felt. The Board laid a 12 inch pipe in Ravensbourne Park, which was much needed. Alter good 8 deal of delay, and an appeal to the Metropolitan Board ol Works the Sewers were commenced for the drainage of Ennersdale and the adjoining Roads in the valley of the Quaggy. The Contract consisted of 189G feet run <>i 3 feet by 2 feet egg shaped brick Sewer, 1250 feet run of 18 inch pipe, 250 feet run of 15 inch pipe, and 3,820 feet run of 12 inch pipe Sewers, together with 17 man-holes, 4 resting places, and 13 lamp-holes, the man-holes and lamp-holes serving as ventilators. The work was carried on during the winter, and although the ground in places was a wet running sand, it was not so bad upon the whole as J anticipated, and 1 am glad to say I expect to save money upon my estimate. When the work is completed, a great nuisance will be abated. The Board defray the cost of putting in the Sewer from Lee Road to the commencement of Enuersdale Road. Mr. Webb laid a pipe Sewer along Brockley Lane, from the Lewisham Cemetery Gate to near Brockley Farm, and thence across the fields to near the "Brockley .lack." This pipe will drain some houses that have no means of drainage excepting cesspools. I think I may say the past year has been an important one so lar as Sewers are concerned, several much needed having been laid or commenced. Referring to my Report, LS78-7D (Page 14), the vexed question of the drainage of Enneisdale, &c., Uoad, is now settled, and the Sewer will soon be completed. llie lable below will give the number of houses sanctioned, drained, &c., during the year. Locality. No. of Houses sanctioned to be Built and Drained. No. of Houses, &c., sanctioned to be Drained. No. of Additions to Buildings sanctioned.

A flooc took place early on the morning of the loth of October. Tlu houses in Molesworth and Rennell Streets, and Shepherd's Place, Lewisham, and Railway Terrace, Ladywell, &c., were flooded, but the height of the water was nearly three feet lower than the great Hood of 1878. The Mill gates, &c., were all open in good time, This bears out what 1 said in my report, Min., 1877, page 32—viz. That the sluices, &c., at the Mills, cannot take the water in a flood. The rainfall, as registered during the storm, was as follows :— In. ForestHill Stone Yard, Deptford Pumping Station 2'49 Private Gangc, Blessington Road, Lee 2-30 I prepared three drawings, showing different methods of dealing withthe flood water at the Silk Mills. 10 Plan No. 1, for obtaining ilie water rights and doing away with the obstruction altogether. Plan No. 2, for widening the storm water overflow 12 feet, deepening it 3 feet, and widening the water-course leading from the weir, and extending the weir 30 feet. This will discharge a large quantity of additional water in time of floods, and was the plan recommended to be carried out (Min., 1870, Page 31G). Plan No. 3 was for extending the weir and widening the water-courses leading from the same. These propositions were submitted to Messrs. Stanton, and are now under their consideration. A great many plans and reports have been prepared during the year, and letters, &c., written. I append to this report a list of the New Streets sanctioned by the Metropolitan Board of Works. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient humble Servant, JOHN CARLINE, C.E., Mem. San. Inst.
