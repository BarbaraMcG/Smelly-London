Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, I have pleasure in submitting my Annual Report for the Year 1952 upon the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough. The estimated population for the year was 48,190. Vital Statistics: The birth-rate was 11.8 per thousands this is the lowest birth-rate yet recorded. The death-rate at 8.2 per thousand was slightly lower than the previous year. The infant mortality rate, i.e. the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per thousand live births was 17.6. This figure is 10 per thousand below that for England and Wales (see table on page 36 ). With regard to infectious diseases in the borough, scarlet fever was the only common infectious disease in which there was a very appreciable rise in incidence; the figures for whooping cough were very considerably lower and those for measles slightly lower than in 1951. There were no cases of diphtheria. Four cases of poliomyelitis were notified during the year, in two of which there was some degree of residual paralysis affecting the lower limbs in both cases, I am glad to be able to record a considerable reduction in the number of fresh notifications, pulmonary and non-pulmonary, of tuberculosis, there being 54 cases as against 50 for the previous year. Accommodation in hospital, or hostels for the aged, was arranged for several old persons during the year} in other cases a home help wa3 provided to assist in less urgent circumstances. In conclusion, I express my appreciation for the help and support afforded to me by the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee, and to Mr. J.F. Rogers, Chief Sanitary Inspector, and the staff of the Health Department for their help and assistance during the year. I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, J.H. CROSBY, Medical Officer of Health. July, 1953 3. SECTION A. 3. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area 2,868 acres.

SECTION G. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supplies A hard, pure and constant piped water supply is provided by the Metropolitan Water Boards: the supply has been satisfactory in both quality and quantity. No samples of drinking water were submitted for bacterial examination during the year. Rivers and Streams Six visits were made during the year in connection with the pollution of water courses. The cause of the pollution being eventually traced to incorrect connections of sanitary fittings. The necessary adjustments were made in all instances. Public Cleansing. A weekly collection of refuse and salvage was maintained and the total weight of refuse disposed of at the Works was 11,325 tons - a slight decrease in relation to the amount collected in the previous year, namely 11,584. The continued decrease in the amount of refuse collected may have some bearing on the widespread use of the slow-burning grate which has become so popular during the last few years. The remarkably high income for the sale of salvaged articles which was recorded for the previous year could not be repeated for the year under review. Although the tonnage of salvage was maintained and even exceeded the previous year the fall in the price of waste papers meant a reduced income, but the final figure of total income at £9,808 was still a good one. The net cost per ton for the collection of refuse was 24s,10d as against 23s,10d for the year ended March, 1952 and 19s.5d for the year ended March, 1951. As no additional staff were employed in the collection of house refuse and salvage the increase in the unit cost per ton has a direct relationship to Wages Awards and to the slightly smaller tonnage of refuse collected. The net cost per ton for the disposal of refuse was 5s.d as compared with a nil expenditure in the previous year and 8s.5d per ton for the year ended March, 1951. Net expenditure for the collection and disposal of refuse and salvage, including loan charges, was £17,226 or 30s.5d per ton as against £12,963 or 22s,5d per ton for the previous year. The fleet of refuse collection freighters was maintained in good condition throughout the year; five vehicles are in daily use and two vehicles are maintained as spares. No new vehicles were acquired during the year. 11. Street eleansing methods continued to give rise to serious consideration during the year and it became clear that the mechanical road sweeper was not suited to a Borough which was provided with so many miles of grass verges. Firstly the mecharical sweeper could not cope with the growth of weeds in the channels and secondly it could not deal with the sweeping of footpaths. For these reasons the Council ultimately decided that the mechanical road sweeper should he abandoned and 'team' sweeping should be instituted in the Borough, utilizing three 24 cell Morrison Electric Trucks, with a driver and three orderlies to each Truck. At the time of writing this Report the electric vehicles have not been delivered and it is, therefore, not possible to comment on the efficiency of the new scheme. During the year street cleansing was carried out by the use of the Lewin Road Sweeper and nine street orderlies and the general condition of the streets may be said to have been satisfactory. Road gullies were cleansed by contract as in previous years, those gullies in main roads being cleansed four times per year and those in district roads twice per year. The public sanitary conveniences were maintained in good condition throughout the year. As mentioned in the previous Report the Council's programme for the rebuilding of sanitary conveniences in the Borough was partly fulfilled by the opening of a new convenience at Chingford Hatch. The new convenience at Rangers Road was not completed during the year under review, but was under construction as was a further new convenience at Green Farm. It will be observed that new forms of Costing Returns are included in this Report as directed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government. 12.

Shops Act, 1950 A total of 352 visits was paid to shops and generally conditions were found to be satisfactory. Spoke Abatement, A petition was received in October, 1951 from residents in Hollywood Road, South Chingford complaining of the emission of cork dust from a chimney in the area. The matter was fully investigated with the firm concerned and after an experimental period and the introduction of new machinery the nuisance from dust emission was virtually abated early in 1952. No further complaints were received during the year. Swimming Pool Summaries of the total chlorine and alkalinity readings are forwarded weekly to the Health Department by the Pool Superintendent. The Pool was opened on the 10th May and closed on the 7th September, 1952. The full use of this attractive open-air Swimming Pool depends largely on weather conditions and the summer again was not such as to enable full attendances to be recorded. The total attendance throughout the season numbered 136,525, the highest attendance being on the 29th June when 8,786 persons were present. Samples of water were taken from the Pool during the months of June, July and August and the results in each case were to the effect that the water was of a high standard of bacterial purity, suitable for bathing purposes. Schools The general condition and supply of water to Schools has been satisfactory during the year. Co-operation was continued with the School Medical Officer and reports were forwarded to that Officer following quarterly visits paid to the canteens attached to all Schools. During the year the rate of progress of the execution of necessary works and improvements was expedited. Offensive Trades Within the meaning of the Public Health Act there are no offensive trade premises in the district, but there are 10 fish fryers. Bakehouses. Thirty-one visits were paid to the eight bakehouses in the district and generally they were maintained in a satisfactory condition. In another section of this report, dealing with action taken under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, three cases involved food which had been prepared in bakehouses, but only in one instance were the premises situated within the Borough, Factories Act, 1937 Eighty-six visits were paid to Factories and in six instances action was taken to secure improvements in provision and segregation of sanitary accommodation. 22 NUMBER AND TRADE OF OUTWORKERS NOTIFIED DURING 1952 Wearing Apparel 81 Box-making 6 Knitwear 69 Novelties 1 Footwear 10 Down Quilts 3 Brush-making 4 Trimmings 6 Handbags 10 Toys 1 Buttons 1 Christmas Crackers 1 Stationery 1 Paper Bags 1 Artificial Flowers 2 Paper Hats 6 OUTWORKERS WERE NOTIFIED FROM THE FOLLOWING AREAS Ilford 4 Hackney 44 St. Pancras 5 Shoreditch 8 Stoke Newington 9 Tottenham 1 Leyton 70 Finsbury 23 Islington 16 Wood Green 1 Westminster 4 West Ham 7 London Corporation 2 East Ham 1 Poplar 1 Enfield 3 Croydon 1 Chigwell 3 Edmonton 3 Lambeth 2 Bethnal Green 7 Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 A full-time Rodent Operative is employed for rodent infestation work and, whilst there was no evidence of major infestations in the town, 2,539 visits were paid to deal with minor infestations at private and business premises.

INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD Milk Supply. The milk supply is from several large firms with dairy premises outside the Borough boundaries, and is mainly pasteurised. Eight samples of milk were analysed during the year and all were certified to be genuine. Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1949 Graded Milks. The following table shows the licences granted during the year for the sale of milk under the special designations, as provided by the above Regulations: 5 dealers' licences to sell milk as Pasteurised. 8 dealers' licences to sell milk as Sterilised. 2 supplementary licences to sell milk as Sterilised. 2 supplementary licences to sell milk as Pasteurised. 5 dealers' licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested. 1 supplementary licence to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested. 1 supplementary licence to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised.) 25. Food and Drugs Act, 1936 Food and Drugs Authority. The Council is the Food and Drugs Authority for the district and during the year samples approximating in number to two per thousand of the population were taken and submitted to the joint Public Analysts. Public Analyst. Mr. George Taylor, F.R.I.C., 20, Eastcheap, London, E.C.J, and Dr. J.H. Hamence, F.R.I.C., 20, Eastcheap, London, E.C.J, continued as joint Public Analysts for the area. Samples Submitted for Analysis. Eight-two samples of foods and drugs were submitted for analysis, twenty-five formal and fifty-seven informal and it will be seen by the following table that a reasonably wide field was covered. The table shows that in four instances samples were adversely reported upon; three of the four samples being sausages and of these three, two were from the same source and manufactured outside the Borough. The Public Analyst declared meat deficiencies of 29.2% and 26.15% respectively in the latter two cases, but owing to the smal quantity of sausages available for sampling in one instance proceedings were instituted in respect of one sample only and taken under the Meat Products and Canned Meat (Control and Maximum Prices) Order 1948 as amended. The case was taken by the Ministry of Food to whom details had been forwarded. The hearing was at Stratford Police Court on the 9th July, 1952 and the manufacturers were fined £10 on each of the four summonses with £5.5s.0d costs. The third sample of sausage was certified to be deficient in meat content to the extent of 10%. The facts were reported to the Ministry of Food and in view of the circumstances a letter of warning was sent to the manufacturer. The fourth sample adversely reported upon was an informal sample of spirit of nitre certified to contain 0.9% w/v only of ethyl nitrate, where as the minimum quantity required by the British Pharmacopoein, 1948 is 1.25%. A letter of warning was sent to the chemist concerned and subsequently existing stocks were withdrawn. 26.
