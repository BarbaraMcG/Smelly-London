AC 439 (1) ENF 43 Borough Council of Enfield ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health (WILLIAM D. HYDE, M.B., Ch.B., D.P.H.) FOR 1959 Borough Council of Enfield ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health (WILLIAM D. HYDE, M.B., Ch.B., D.P.H.) FOR 1959 3 ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, 1959. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Enfield. I have pleasure in presenting my Annual Report for 1959. With the exception of the inauguration of the first Smoke Control Area, referred to in more detail in another part of this report, no event of major Public Health interest occurred in the Borough during the year. The main work of the Department continued in its characteristically unspectacular manner and much success was achieved in improving conditions generally for the benefit of the health of the district and preventing the occurrence of any serious detrimental incident. Indeed we are always grateful when the Health Department avoids "hitting the headlines" as such an occurrence can mean the failure to some extent of our preventive measures, however blameless we may be. In the realm of Health Propaganda, we once again provided an exhibition at the Enfield Show, this year in conjunction with other Departments of the Council, as a continuation or extension of a Civic Exhibition held earlier in the year at Forty Hall. Again we were glad to find an encouraging degree of interest shown by the public as this form of Health Propaganda involves a considerable amount of time and effort additional to our normal activities. The summer was distinguished by the long spell of good weather which we all enjoyed and from which we must have benefitted. It would appear that consequently greater use of the excellent local facilities for healthy open air activities, which by coincidence I stressed last year, was encouraged, and proved beneficial in spite of the troubles caused by the very large numbers of wasps-nests with which we endeavoured to deal to the best of our ability and capacity, although such an activity is not strictly considered to be a Public Health activity. Now that some progress has been made in regard to clearing our environment of smoke contamination, attention is being focussed 4 nationally on the abatement of noise which in its own way can be just as harmful to health. While most people will readily accept the need for Clean Air, I foresee, unfortunately, some reluctance to accept the same need or degree of urgency with regard to noise, because what may be pleasantly noisy to some or unnoticed by others, may constitute a real nuisance to quite a number of people, as witnessed by the fact that the B.B.C. frequently broadcast requests in the Summer for people to reduce the volume of sound from their radio sets. I myself, have on occasions, in the course of duty which involves entering houses to undertake an examination or inspection, found it necessary to request householders to switch off the radio to which they have grown accustomed or oblivious, in order that I could carry out my work satisfactorily. Noise nuisance can come from such a variety of sources, in such a variety of forms, to such a variety of recipients, that I think that control of noise nuisance is fraught with difficulty. Now let us look at the Vital Statistics of the Borough. The population has increased slightly to 109,700, and the number of inhabited houses has also increased, although the need for more is still urgent. The Birth Rate is slightly lower at 13.44 per thousand population and the illegitimate rate remains around its usual figure of about 4 per cent, of total births. There was a marked decrease in the number of still-births, and the Infant Mortality Rate of 19.66 compares favourably with that of England and Wales at 22.0. The Death Rate was also somewhat lower than that for England and Wales, but unfortunately one woman died in consequence of childbirth. Cancer continues to take its heavy toll and cancer of the lungs and bronchi shows no evidence of abating. The fact that nearly twelve times as many people died from this form of cancer as died from tuberculosis of the lungs needs no further comment from me this year. Home accidents, road accidents, other accidents and suicides, continue to cause concern particularly because of the preventable nature of many of them. For many years I have tried to stress the importance of safeguards in the home to prevent the occurrence of so much unnecessary suffering and sorrow. This year I feel impelled also to refer to fatal road accidents because of the publicity given recently to the consumption of alcohol as a cause, and to wonder if, perhaps, we should not be condemning haste, selfishness, impatience, and downright bad manners by all categories of road users, as the main causes—all factors well within the bounds of prevention. 5 The control of infectious diseases is still an important aspect of our work although several of the diseases which formerly were prevalent and serious in nature are not now such a problem. Although we have had no death from Diphtheria for over 13 years, nor indeed any case for over 11 years, the fact that it has appeared in nearby districts should emphasise to us the danger of complacency about this disease. There were nearly a hundred cases of Scarlet Fever, a similar figure to last year and similarly mild in character. Measles was not so prevalent as last year and only 4 were treated in hospital, and 5 of the 64 cases of whooping-cough required hospital treatment. Mild dysentery, only 38 cases notified, was relatively uncommon. We had our first year free of poliomyelitis since 1946. Actually less than 100 Enfield cases of infectious disease were admitted to the local infectious disease hospital. Apart from pneumonia, the only deaths from notifiable infectious diseases were the 5 deaths from respiratory tuberculosis and one from another tuberculous condition, and the notifications of new cases of tuberculosis were considerably less than the previous year. In fact the year showed the lowest number of deaths from tuberculosis and the second lowest number of new cases ever recorded. However, the report of the visit of the Mass Radiography Unit shows the need for constant vigilance in this disease, especially in case resistance to drugs develops. In conclusion I would like to express my appreciation of the services of the staff of the Health Department during the year. William D. Hyde, Medical Officer of Health. 6 BOROUGH OF ENFIELD Alderman A. A. F. Tatman, B.E.M., J.P Mayor Alderman A. M. Eeles Deputy Mayor Aldermen: Mrs. G. M. Jay, J.P. A. M. Eeles, Esq. W. G. Bowyer, Esq.

Of the 29 infants who died before reaching the age of 1 year, 21 died within the first 4 weeks of life, and of this number, 20 occurred in infants under 1 week. The infant mortality rate for the Borough is 19.66. INQUESTS Thirty one inquests and one hundred and sixty four post mortem examinations without inquests were held during the year. Of these, 164 deaths were due to natural causes, 18 to accidental causes, 9 to suicide, 2 to misadventure and in 2 cases an open verdict was recorded. 12 FATAL HOME ACCIDENTS During the year under review, there were 9 fatal home accidents to Enfield residents, being 6 less than the previous year. All of these accidents occurred amongst elderly people, 4 being over 80 years of age and 5 between 69 and 80 years of age. The precipitating cause of death in 6 cases was a fall leading in most instances to fractured bones and followed usually by lung complications. Of the remainder, 2 females died from accidental coal gas poisoning and one female from asphyxia due to drowning in a domestic bath. The number of fatal Road Accidents to Enfield residents during the year was 8. Unfortunately there were also 9 (4 male, 5 female) cases of suicide, 4 of which were in the 35-50 years age group and 5 were over the age of 50. The method adopted in 5 cases was coal gas poisoning. It is disquieting to consider the sum total of human misery recorded in these paragraphs, and to ponder over the fact that so much could, and should, be prevented. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACTS, 1948 AND 1951. No action was necessary during the year under these Acts. Such cases as were brought to the notice of the Health Department were dealt with by the Medical Officer of Health in cooperation either with the Medical Practitioners or Welfare Officer, and the patients voluntarily agreed to go to Hospital or suitable Institution. Most old people show a natural reluctance to leave their homes, which sometimes consist of a single room in a dirty and unhygienic state owing to their inability to look after the premises. Some should not be living alone, and although we must not be hasty to criticize, there appears to be in some cases a need for the awakening of responsibility of the family to its aged members. In some instances, where reluctance to leave their homes is encountered, provision of Home Help and District Nurse Services can be arranged and a careful watch on the situation maintained by members of the Health Department Staff, and compulsory removal in the interests of the old person is rarely enforced, as persuasion usually succeeds in the end. 13 AMBULANCE SERVICE The County Ambulance Service is operated in two distinct branches, i.e., the Accident Branch and the Sick Removal Branch. The Accident Service operates from Fire Stations and where an ambulance is required for accident or emergency purposes, the Emergency Exchange telephone facilities should be used, whereby calls are routed to the nearest Fire Station. The Sick Removal Service is housed locally in a depot adjacent to Chase Farm Hospital, where calls are received for both recumbent and sitting cases. WATER SUPPLY The Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board, except for part of the Hadley Wood and Cockfosters area, which is supplied by the Barnet District Water Company. Both of these Authorities take regular and frequent samples for analysis. Copies of the reports on these are sent to the Health Department, and have shown satisfactory results. There was no cause to suspect any contamination during the year. The question of well-water supplies, both in connection with dwelling-houses and industrial premises, throughout the Borough has received the careful attention of the Department during the year, and every care has been exercised to see that such supplies are not used for drinking purposes where mains water supply is available. There is now only one dwelling in Enfield which relies solely on well water for its water supply and this is under regular supervision. During the year four samples of water from this well were examined bacteriologically and all were found to be satisfactory. In addition, two samples of drinking water other than from wells were bacteriologically examined, and found to be satisfactory. 14 MEDICAL ASSESSMENT OF EMPLOYEES. The following medical examinations or assessments of employees were carried out during the year:— (1) Superannuation Act: Medical examinations 47 Assessments without medical examinations 38 (2) Sick Pay Scheme: Medical examinations 56 Assessments without medical examinations 45 HOUSING Number of new houses erected during the year by:— (a) Local Authority 30 (b) Other Local Authorities — (c) Other bodies or persons 332 With State assistance (included in above totals):— (a) Local Authority 30 (b) Other Local Authorities — (c) Other bodies or persons — 1.

To qualify for a standard grant, a house must, after improvement, be provided with all five standard amenities and they must be for the exclusive use of the occupants. If a house is already provided with some of the standard amenities, a grant can be claimed towards the cost of installing the remainder. The popularity of this Act is evinced from the increased number of visits made by the inspectorial staff, 1,366 against 587 for the previous year, for in addition, there is the existing Discretionary Grant Scheme where grants are payable for a wider range and more extensive forms of improvements including the conversion or adaptation of larger houses and other buildings. Commencing with a preliminary inspection to determine the fitness of the property and its suitability for a grant, it is necessary, upon the Council agreeing to make a grant, to make several subsequent visits to ensure that the conditions of the Grant Scheme are being observed.

There are also certain changes in the arrangements for licensing, and provision is made for each Local Authority to review and report to the Minister on the existing and probable facilities and future requirements of their district in regard to slaughterhouse facilities. THE MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATIONS) (RAW MILK) AND (PASTEURISED AND STERILISED MILK) REGULATIONS, 1949 AND 1950. The following Licences were in operation at the end of the year: Grade. Dealers. Supplementary.

FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1955. There are 296 Ice Cream retail premises and 186 Food Preparing premises registered under Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955. 28 samples of ice cream were taken of which 17 were Grade I, 5 Grade II and 4 Grade III. In 2 other cases the tests were declared void as conditions were unsatisfactory. 19 Examination of Foods Number of inspections made of retail shops, stalls and food-preparing premises, etc. 2,339 Number and weight of articles, etc., of foodstuffs condemned as unfit for food:— Articles Foodstuffs Weight—lbs. 1,615 Fruits 1,748 1,251 Vegetables 751 34 Fish (Fresh) 334 474 Fish (Tinned) 189 754 Meats 1,542 2,848 Meat (Fresh) 11,789 119 Bacon 1,902 113 Soups 100 151 Beans 89 25 Shellfish 5 50 Rice 45 24 Macaroni and Spaghetti 14 34 Jams 68 73 Fats 91 204 Cream and Milk 261 60 Lemonade Powder 15 7 Salad Cream 3 7,836 18,946 Total No. of articles, etc., condemned 7,836 No. of Certificates of condemnation issued 1,195 Total weight of foodstuffs condemned as unfit for human consumption:— 8 tons 9 cwts. 18 lbs. Method of Disposal of Condemned foods All unfit foodstuffs were destroyed in the Council's Refuse Destructor furnaces. 20 THE FOOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS 1955-1958 1,887 visits were made to food premises of all types during the year. Many of these visits resulted in improvements, often of structural nature, above the minimum requirements of the Regulations. In addition to structural alterations and modernisation of equipment in factory canteens, 4 completely new canteens have been erected, and the premises, including the kitchen, bar and pavilion of an Athletic Club have been altered, refitted and generally improved. The provision of wash basins in the sanitary conveniences of Public Houses where no adequate facilities previously existed, particularly those Public Houses where meals and snacks are served, has been, and will be, encouraged. During the year a complete survey of all school canteens and sculleries within the Borough, was made. Protection, by refrigeration, of food on display increased encouragingly, and this was particularly so with butchers' window displays. An extensive programme for the improvement of conditions at the only private slaughterhouse in the Borough was agreed with the Management and structural improvements and better lighting have already been carried out. Of the three entirely open-fronted fish shops remaining at the end of 1958, one was closed during 1959, another provided with a degree of display protection, whilst the third was substantially converted by the end of the year to a modern closed-fronted shop. Improvements of a general character were effected in 58 food premises. As part of two well-attended Civic Exhibitions, held at different times during the year, the Department's work in the field of Food Hygiene was depicted—the theme being "Clean Food a Key to Good Health." On this Stand were displayed examples of Hygiene in the home; Hygiene in food premises; Inspection of meat and other food items. The exhibition of diseased foods, which included fresh meat and poultry specimens in addition to preserved specimens, aroused great interest among the public and was particularly marked in the case of the diseased fresh meat and poultry. 21 Sampling of washing up water and swab testing of food utensils and equipment, continued, including a series at the Slaughterhouse. A very useful purpose was served in respect of the latter as it was shown that with the regular proper use of a good liquid sterilising agent, bacterial counts could be greatly reduced, and washing-up water and swabs from slaughtermen's steels, saws and knives, and washing down cloths etc., made negative to the coliform test. Some prosecutions were taken during the year, under the Food and Drugs Act, 1955. A butcher was prosecuted under Section 8 for selling a joint of meat which was unfit for human consumption and was fined £10 with £3 3s. Od. costs. He appealed against this conviction to Quarter Sessions in and for the County of Middlesex. His appeal was dismissed and costs awarded to the Council. A firm of mineral water manufacturers was prosecuted under Section 2, for selling a bottle of lemonade containing the carcase of a mouse, and was fined £5 with costs. A baker was prosecuted under Section 2 for selling a loaf of bread containing rodent excreta and was fined £20 and costs. A firm making meat pies was prosecuted under Section 8, for selling a mouldy pork pie and was fined £5 with costs. A grocer was prosecuted under Section 8, for selling a cream filled Swiss Roll which was unfit for human consumption and was fined £20 with costs. This grocer was further prosecuted under Section 8 in respect of another of his Stores for selling a chocolate flavoured Swiss Roll, which was unfit for human consumption and was fined £25 with costs. In view of the continued importance of food hygiene, arrangements were made for two of the Department's Public Health Inspectors to attend an 18 weeks Refresher Course in Meat Inspection at the National College of Food Technology, London, on one evening a week. 22 food and drugs act, 1955 The following table gives details of the samples of foods and drugs procured under the above Act in Enfield by the Food and Drugs Authority during 1959:- Article. Total samples procured. Unsatisfactory. Milk (various) 77 1 Milk (new) 52 - Butter 14 - Cakes, etc. 14 1 Cheese 6 - Cooked meat 16 - Cream 6 - Drugs 15 - Fish and Fish Products 29 - Fruit juice etc. 13 1 Ice cream 31 - Margarine 4 - Meat and Meat Products 39 - Fruit—Fresh and Canned, etc. 20 2 Liver 15 - Sausages 14 1 Coffee 4 - Spirits 6 - Vinegar 20 4 Miscellaneous 23 - Totals: 418 10 With regard to the 10 samples noted as unsatisfactory, the following comments are made : Milk. Only one sample of milk was found not to be up to the required minimum standard. A bottle supplied by a retailer contained milk deficient in fat. Subsequent sampling proved this sample to be an isolated case and no further action was taken. Cakes. A retailer sold doughnuts containing imitation cream as "Cream Doughnuts." This proved to be an error by an inexperienced assistant so the Firm concerned were issued with an official caution. Fruit, Fresh and Canned, etc. Two purchases of Clementine Oranges claimed to be seedless were made from a retailer and in each case seeds were found. The number in each fruit was small and a caution was given. 23 Fruit Juice, Squash, etc. A sample of fruit drink labelled simply "Blackcurrant" was found upon analysis to consist of 10 per cent. blackcurrant juice and 20 per cent. grape juice. The manufacturers had obtained advice as to the proper labelling of this product and a misunderstanding had arisen. In view of these special circumstances an official caution was issued and the name changed to " Blackcurrant Drink." Sausages. Sausages supplied to a school kitchen were found to contain preservative, although its presence was not declared as required by the Public Health (Preservatives, etc., in Food) Regulations 1925 to 1958. The matter was taken up with the supplier concerned who immediately remedied the omission. An official caution was given in this case. Vinegar. Four samples of vinegar obtained from retailers were found to be below the minimum acetic acid content of 4 per cent. Vinegar sold from the barrel deteriorates during storage and in each case this was found to be the cause. The deficiencies were not large and official cautions were issued. Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887 - 1953. The majority of the inspection work carried out under the provisions of the above Acts relates to ensuring that the requirements of the various Marking Orders made under the provisions of the Act of 1926 are complied with. These Orders apply to the marking of the country of origin on imported foodstuffs, principally meat, apples, tomatoes, currants, raisins, sultanas, bacon, ham, poultry, butter and honey, upon sale and exposure for sale. Inspections were made at 294 premises of 1,026 displays of these foodstuffs. Any infringements detected were of a minor nature and were dealt with by verbal warning. Labelling of Food Order, 1953. This Order requires pre-packed food to be marked with the name and address, or with the Registered Trade Mark, of the packer or labeller. It also requires such food to be labelled with its common or usual name (if any), and in the case of a compounded food with the names of the ingredients in descending order of proportion by weight. It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed and prescribes specific labelling of certain foods. A total of 1,171 articles of pre-packed food was examined at 294 different premises to ascertain whether there was compliance with the above regulations. False and Misleading Descriptions. Food advertisements and labels have been scrutinised for false and misleading statements and descriptions. No serious infringements were disclosed. Corrective action taken within the whole area of the County has equal effect within the Boroughs, and work under this heading is combined 24 with inspections made in connection with the Merchandise Marks Acts and the Labelling of Food Order. Examples where corrective action was sought are fruit syrups described as fruit "juices," slimming claims in connection with lemon juice drinks, and a "Seedless Fig Bar" which contained crushed seeds. Some extravagant claims in respect of medical remedies were challenged and the advertisements withdrawn. Special Designated Milk. During 1959 the County Council issued one Dealers' (Pasteuriser's) Licence and one Dealers' (Sterilizer's) Licence in respect of premises within the Borough where milk is processed. These premises were regularly inspected and compliance with statutory requirements was well maintained. A total of 72 samples of designated milk was taken, none of which failed to obtain a satisfactory certificate. Safe Milk. In addition to the foregoing, 37 samples of raw milk were procured and submitted to tests for the presence of tubercle bacilli. None was found contaminated.

During the year a Rodent Investigating Officer and three operators were engaged on control of rat infestation at dwellinghouses and other premises and of the sewers in the Borough. The Council provides this service to the occupiers of all dwellinghouses free of charge ; industrial and business premises are dealt with at the request of the proprietors who pay the full cost of any disinfestation undertaken at their premises. 31 1,403 premises were inspected during the year for rat and mice infestation, and of these 443 were found to be affected. The total number of treatments carried out by the Department including domestic, business and factory premises, was 396. During the year the Public Health Inspectors and Rodent Investigating Staff made 4,871 visits concerning rat infestation. During the year the treatment of sewers by Sodium Fluoracetate in damp coorse Oatmeal has continued, three treatments involving 351 manholes being carried out. DISINFESTATION Number of Council Houses suspected to be infested 12 Number of Council houses disinfested as precautionary measure 12 Number of other houses suspected to be infested 24 Number of other houses disinfested as precautionary measure 21 Number of articles of clothing, bedding, etc., disinfested 24 Householders are urged to seek the assistance ol the Health Department immediately they suspect the presence of bugs or similar pests. PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTORS' INSPECTIONS AND VISITS The following report, in condensed form, gives details of the work of the Public Health Inspectors during the year 1959.

As two firms with premises previously registered under the Act have now ceased business and one new registration was effected during the year, the total number of premises registered in Enfield is now four. 35 PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. This Act, which controls the keeping of a pet shop, came into force on the 1st April, 1952. During the course of the year four premises previously licensed by the local authority were re-licensed. In addition, one new application for licensing was granted. THE HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952. THE HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) REGULATIONS, 1953. The above legislation requires fireguards to be fitted to gas fires, electric fires and oil heaters of types so designed that they are suitable for domestic use, and so constructed that without a guard there is likelihood of injury by burning, or of ignition of clothing by reason of contact with, or proximity to the heating element or flame. Each of the Public Health Inspectors is a duly appointed officer under the Act. FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 AND 1948 A register is kept of all the factories in the Borough, and during the year 214 inspections were carried out. The register has recently been revised and is in accordance with the list kept by H.M.

Byelaws were made in 1937 for the purpose of securing the cleanliness of any premises used for carrying on the business of a hairdresser or barber and of the instruments, towels, and materials used in such premises. These byelaws have proved useful in maintaining a high standard in the premises of the Borough. PLACES OF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT Number of inspections of sanitary accommodation 71 OFFENSIVE TRADES There are now no offensive trade businesses established in the Borough. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 The provisions of the above Act include those relating to the prohibition of dark smoke from chimneys, measures for dealing with grit and dust from furnaces, abatement of smoke nuisance and the application of the Act to railway engines, vessels and Crown premises. On the 1st October 1959, the Smoke Control Order in respect of Area No. 1 came into operation, the area concerned being the Haddon Estate and part of the Great Cambridge Road. This area included 515 dwelling houses and the response in converting and adapting existing appliances was generally very good. During the year the Council provisionally agreed to include the whole of Enfield in Smoke Control Areas within a period of fifteen years, and also agreed a programme for the next five years. Progress was made in the action necessary to inaugurate in 1960 a second Smoke Control Area, which it is proposed will completely surround Area No. 1, and is much larger, in that some 3,000 dwellings are included. The boundaries suggested are—the Borough boundary to the north, the Churchbury railway line to the east, Forty Hill/Bulls Cross to the west and Carterhatch Lane and Myddelton Avenue to the south. 38 With regard to the measurement of atmospheric pollution, analyses of deposit gauges and lead peroxide instruments at four sites in the Borough were continued. Unfortunately, smoke emission from some chimneys in the District caused concern, and particularly strong representations were made by the Council in one instance. SWIMMING BATH AND POOL Enfield has two public swimming pools, a relatively modern open-air pool, built in 1932, situated next to the Sports Stadium, and an indoor bath at Enfield Lock, built in 1895, but recently greatly improved by extensions and modernisation. As regards the purification of the water, the up-to-date method of chlorination, filtration and aeration is used at both premises. This gives a safe and pleasant bathing water. Reports on the twice-daily examinations for chlorine and alkalinity of the water are sent to the Medical Officer of Health, and the Public Health Inspectors take samples for bacteriological tests at appropriate intervals. At both the open-air pool and the indoor bath, slipper bath facilities are available. PUBLIC MORTUARY There is now no public mortuary in Enfield, but use is made at present of a Hospital Mortuary.
