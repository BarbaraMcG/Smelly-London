The Urban District of Barnes embraces the parishes of Barnes and Mortlake.

According to the rate-books the number of inhabited housed in the district at Midsummer last was 5,332. Of these rather more than half were in Mortlake, rather less than half in Barnes. During the last 6 months of the year the increase in the number of inhabited houses was considerably greater than in the early part of the year, and I estimate the population at December 31st to have been at least 29,000. I estimate the population at Midsummer to have been 28,000, of which 13,450 were resident in Barnes and 14,550 in Mortlake. On this estimate the birth-rate for the whole district in 1907 was 24 4, exactly the average for the preceding ten years (see Appendix B, Tables 1. and II.). The number of births which actually occurred in Barnes during 1907 was 277, seven less than in 1906, and the number of those in Mortlake 407. one hundred and fifty-nine more than in 1906. In the subjoined table the yearly increases in the number of inhabited houses since the last Census are set forth. Date of Computation. Number of Inhabited Houses. Barnes. Mortlake. Total. 1901 Census (March) 1893 1510 3403 1902 (Midsummer) 2051 1763 3814 1903 (Midsummer) 2167 1869 4036 1904 (Midsummer) 2315 2120 4435 1905 (Midsummer) 2377 2308 4685 1906 (Midsummer) 2459 2464 4923 1907 (Midsummer) 2576 2756 5332 Increase in 6¼ years 683 1246 1929 14 It is obvious that Mortlake continues to increase in population more rapidly than Barnes, and, in fact, has become in point of population the "predominant partner" in the Urban District. The death rate at all ages is once more the lowest yet recorded for this district, and the very marked fall in infantile mortality is particularly noteworthy. It is true that 1907 was, in most districts, a healthy year for infants. Still, the fact that the infantile mortality for 1907 was so low as 92 per 1,000 births, while the lowest rates hitherto recorded have been 111 and 112 is most encouraging, especially when it is remembered that there has been a steady and continuous decrease noted since 1904, and that the birth rate itself remains at the average of the last ten years. Important factors in securing this improvement have been (a) the introduction of the constant water supply: (b) the improvement in the general condition of the poorer dwellings: (c) the particular attention given by the Surveyor to the road conditions of the poorer quarters : and (d) the closer supervision of the retail milk trade. Tables IV and V, Appendix A, give detailed information of the causes of, and ages at, death during 1907. It will be seen that only eight deaths were due to measles, scarlet fever, whooping cough and diphtheria, that none occurred from enteric fever, and but seven from diarrhœa. On the other hand, fourteen were ascribed to epidemic influenza. Eighteen deaths occurred from phthisis, and sixteen from malignant disease. These figures shew some improvement on past years. 15 Eight deaths were definitely stated to be due to chronic alcoholism. In other words, of every hundred persons dying above the age of 25 four were certified to have died from the effects of alcohol. The actual number that so died was no doubt greater. Table V. deserves special attention. It will be seen that in all 65 deaths of infants under 1 year in age are analysed. Of these 65 deaths so many as 19 are ascribed to premature birth, although in eight instances the children survived one week. Nine children died from nutritional defects and seven from diarrhoea. Seven died from meningitis and three from suffocation. It is obvious that, although much has been done, much more may yet be done to reduce our infantile death rate. Housing of the Working Classes. The demand for increasing housing facilities caused by the influx of motor men and other artisans has been lately met to a great extent by the subletting of small houses of a rental of £28—32 a year or thereabouts, in which, a few years ago, but one family resided. The difficulties and evils to which this has given rise are apparent, and the Sanitary Department has given special attention to the subject. A block of Workmen's cottages of a distinctly good type has been built by private enterprise in Mortlake, and is already well filled. In the early part of 1907 further consideration was given to my special report of May, 1906, on the condition of what is known as the "Malthouse Area" in Barnes. 16 Plans were prepared by a Sub-Committee for the clearance and re-building of this area, but ultimately it was resolved by the Council that for financial reasons this could not be carried out. The resolution of the Council also referred to the fact that the owner of a certain part of the property in this area had carried out certain improvements. I have little to add to what I have already said in past reports on the condition of this area. It would seem not unlikely, however, that the financial tragedy of the Sibylline books may have, in our local history, yet one more parallel. For, without doubt, six or seven years ago the necessary work could have been carried out for much less than it would now cost, and it seems probable that the longer the work is delayed the greater will be the ultimate cost, and the less will be the benefits resulting. In the meantime the Sanitary Department has knowledge of other areas and groups of houses, the condition of which is rapidly approximating to that of this more notorious area, and to which serious attention will have, sooner or later, to be given. Sewerage, Drainage, Cesspools, and Water Supply. House drains were in 61 instances during 1907 amended or reconstructed under notice from the Sanitary department. Continued attention has been paid to the existing cesspools, and most are now in a fairly satisfactory condition. 17 In my report for 1906 1 drew attention to the fact thnt many streets in Barnes and Mortlake are not, or were not then, channelled, and that in most instances the sidewalks were not flagpaved, and in many the curbing was irregular. I further pointed out that the absence of channelling in roads such as White Hart Lane, and in areas such as the Westflelds, Littleworth End, and Lillian Road, was now a matter of sanitary importance. 1 went on to say that 1 felt sure "that the channelling of these roads, the macadamizing of some of them, and the making good the sidewalks of others, together with the diversion of the storm water, would go a long way towards the reducing the amount of diphtheria and sore throat which undoubtedly does prevail in excess in this district." 1 am glad to be able to report that at the time of writing the work of channelling and flag paving part of the Westflelds is in progress. But when this task is completed only a part of that which I last year indicated as desirable will have been done, and there is no justification for the suggestion that the flagpaving and channelling of the Westflelds is equivalent to the stamping out of diphtheria and scarlet fever. I believe that as this kind of sanitary work is carried out throughout the district (and there are many roads besides the Westflelds where it is needed) that sore throat and diphtheria will become relatively less frequent. But with the perpetual increase of the artizan population it would be absurd to hold out hope that the absolute amount of disease will yet awhile become less, and it will be a matter for congratulation indeed if it does not increase. 18 The condition of White Hart Lane does require attention very urgently, and I trust that in another year 1 shall be able to report that it has been put in order and that some progress has been made towards the betterment of the Lillian Road area and other parts of the district. Nuisances. Statistical record of the work done during 1907 is given in the tables in Appendix C, which clearly indicate the very great attention that under the experienced direction of Mr. Grylls, has been given to these matters. Note may particularly be taken of the number of instances in which drains have been amended or reconstructed and backyards paved. Mention should be made of one case in which a summons was taken out at the Mortlake Petty Sessional Court. Premises known as Roteman's Wall Paper Manufactory were, in 1907, taken over by a company engaged in the making of gas mantles. In the process of making gas mantles a fabric is dipped in a compound of ethereal and allied substances, and, during the drying, vapours are given off of varying nature. In this particular case residents in the neighbourhood of the factory alluded to complained of the intermittent production of ethereal and other vapours (some, resembling "pear-drops," evidently amylic) which they alleged caused nausea, retching, and other unpleasant effects, and were also a nuisance. As, in my opinion, these complaints were well based, I recommended that proceedings be taken under Sec. 114 of the Public Health Act, 1875. At the hearing of the case evidence was produced in support of the allegations and complaints, but, other evidence being called for the defendants, which consisted of the 19 testimony of persons who had either not noticed the vapours or to whom the vapours were not offensive, in the result the summons was dismissed. A recent judgment in the High Courts, however, would seem to indicate that if persons resident in a neighbourhood prior to the commencement of what they suffer from as a nuisance are in fact seriously affected by such a nuisance it is no defence to produce the evidence of other less sensitive or refined persons who are not annoyed by the proceedings in question. Places over which the Council has Supervision. The special report concerning Factories, Workshops, and Workplaces is found in Appendix A. As will be seen from the tables there supplied, the chief defects found during 1907 were those arising from want of cleanliness. In each case the necessary work was carried out. In Appendix C particulars are given of the number of milkshops, slaughterhouses, etc., in the district. Cowkeepers are no more to be found in either Barnes or Mortlake, but the total number of places where milk is known to be sold is now 38. 124 visits were made by the Sanitary Inspectors to these places, and many more by myself during 1907, and I am glad to say that there is a progressive improvement in the standard of cleanliness observed by the various shopkeepers. The three slaughterhouses are fairly well kept, and so are the fourteen bakehouses, but constant visitation is required to keep these places up to the mark. Infectious Disease. No definite outbreak of disease occurred during 1907. The cases of scarlet fever and diphtheria that did occur were mostly scattered about the district and distributed amongst all classes. Measles was infrequent, but some whooping cough occurred in the 20 earlier part of the year, and much mumps. The deaths from infantile diarrhoea were, as has already been mentioned, relatively very few, and although this relative immunity was no doubt due in part to improved sanitary conditions, of course the climatic circumstances of the summer were extremely favourable. Isolation and disinfection is carried out with greater care and stringency than in former years, and the good effects of these and other administrative improvements are beginning to be seen. The first table in Appendix C affords some indication of this. In the quinquennium 1896-1900 the cases of scarlet fever, diphtheria, and enteric fever notified per 1,000 of the population averaged 6.08 ; in the succeeding quinquennium 4.3; and in 1907 3T. Taking the years 1896 to 1907, it will be seen that the three worst years, 1898, 1899, and 1902, occurred before 1903, and the three best years, 1904, 1905, and 1907, since that date. The improvement that has occurred is chiefly with regard to scarlet fever, but in respect of diphtheria some allowance may fairly be made for (a) the notification, in order to be on the safe side, of doubtful cases, and (b) the more accurate diagnosis of slight cases. Still, there is far too much diphtheria and sore throat generally in the district, and much work yet requires to be done. During the past year a considerable amount of bacteriological work has been done at the Hospital in the way of assisting diagnosis, with, it is thought, very good results. Hospital Accommodation, &c. During 1907 seventy-four cases were treated in the Isolation Hospital. Of these, one was a patient admitted on January 1st, 1907, who was notified in 1906, and one an adult patient who was found on admission to be suffering from drug rash. In this latter instance the formal notification had not been given, and therefore the figures shown in Table III. Appendix A are correct, 21 Of the remaining seventy-two cases one was one of typhoid, one was an instance of puerperal septicemia, 49 were cases of scarlet fever or scarlet fever and diphtheria, seventeen were cases of diphtheria, and four were cases sent in as either scarlet fever or diphtheria, and proving to be otherwise. Of eighty-six cases of scarlet fever or diphtheria notified, seventy-three were removed to hospital, or eighty-one per cent. This percentage is rather lower than usual, and is due to the fact that during 1907 a larger proportion of cases than usual occurred in houses where proper facilities for isolation existed. These cases were also mostly those of persons above fifteen years of age, Although the absolute number admitted to the hospital during 1907 was not very great, still, in the early part of the year, there was very great strain on the accommodation owing to the fact that an unusually large number of groups of cases had to be treated at once. Thus at one time there were present simultaneously cases of diphtheria, scarlet fever, scarlet fever and diphtheria, typhoid, diphtheria and whooping cough, and other complaints or combination of complaints. Under circumstances such as these the knowledge of the nominal number of beds in a hospital is of little consolation to those who have to deal practically with the situation caused, not only by the necessity of separating the various diseases, but also the sexes, and the "convalescents" from the "acutes." It was my duty therefore to urge anew (especially as a lamentable series of cross-infections, &c., had arisen as a result of the deficient ward accommodation in December, 1906) the building of the ward block first suggested by me in 1901. Decision was, however, postponed, but two very necessary and important improvements were carried out, under the supervision of Mr. Tomes, in the conversion of the hand laundry 22 to steam and the provision of bathrooms for the diphtheria block Later in the year the question of the ward block and the provision of a new mortuary were referred to a Special Committee for inquiry and report, and since then (January, 1908) these absolutely necessary works have been decided on. I trust that there will be found no occasion for further delaying their execution. The fact that the hospital rate for 1906-7 was 4.2d. in the pound had, I have no doubt, some influence in causing the postponement for a time of the decision to realise these projects. But this rate of 4.2d. was actually exceeded in the year 1899-1900, and would not have been reached in 1906-7 but for the expensive and severe prevalence of diphtheria during 1906, and the very great administrative difficulties that arose as a direct consequence of the insufficient accommodation available late in 1906. It should not be forgotten too that during 1906-7 there were special charges not likely to recur annually, and also that the "hospital" is something more than a "hospital," being also the disinfecting station for the whole district. The new ward block is needed in order that recurring outbreaks of scarlet fever and diphtheria may be dealt with without fear of cross-infection, and in order that mixed cases, doubtful cases, and cases of disease other than scarlet fever or diphtheria may be Properly isolated, without danger to themselves or others, and without the administrative waste that is the inevitable result of attempting to do without what is necessary. 23 I believe that there will be a real economy in working when this new block is erected, especially if it is found possible to reserve the "old block" for mixed, doubtful, or other cases, as in practice this block, consisting as it does of four wards and two duty rooms, is a woefully extravagant place in which to nurse the ten cases it nominally holds if these ten cases be all instances of one disease. The necessity for the erection of a small and suitable mortuary is, I think, generally admitted. It is to be hoped that when these proposed works are executed that the preventive side of the Council's health work—I mean the work of the Sanitary Department—will be so supported and strengthened that, in spite of the inevitable growth of the district, it will be some years before there is need for capital expenditure on the hospital except in respect of those minor works and improvements which are best carried out from time to time before postponement and delay has led to makeshifts and contrivances which are rarely efficient and always extravagant. During 1907 Miss Clark, the Matron, whose services had been most valuable, received an appointment in India, and Miss Bellinger, the Chief Nurse, was appointed to succeed her. A block plan of the hospital is given on page 11 of this report, and shows the disposition of the present and projected buildings. The paths, &c., have been laid out in such a way that proper arrangements can be made on the site in the event of the population of the district rising to its probable maximum—70,000. School Hygiene. The system of inspection and supervision of public elementary schools, mentioned in my last report, has been continued in this district with, I think it may be said, very satisfactory results. 24 Visits of inspection to the schools have been made by me regularly and a considerable number of children have been examined for school attendance purposes. Detailed reports have been sent each term to Dr. Jones, the County Education Medical Officer, and these reports are incorporated in Dr. Jones' report to the Surrey County Council. One large and excellent school has been built during the year at Mortlake, and recently opened, and another one is contemplated for erection in Barnes. The plans in both these instances are on the usual lines, shewing central halls, but it is to be hoped that in future years attention will be paid to the plans recently described by Dr. George Reid, the County Medical Officer of Health for Staffordshire, which are undoubtedly the best. In these plans the "central hall " is abandoned and the class rooms open on to a kind of open corridor, in this way securing economy in space and simplicity and perfection in ventilation. Considerable improvements are needed in most of the existing public elementary schools in the district, and some are, I believe, under consideration. With regard to the work of examination of scholars for school attendance purposes, some remarks may perhaps be made. The examining medical officer, while exercising the greatest vigilance in detecting what may be called vicarious malingering, has to protect attending scholars against risk of infection or contamination, and defaulting children, who are really ill, from hardships all arising from their parents' laxity, or evasion of proper observances. In some instances definite certification as desired by managers or attendance officers cannot be made. For instance, a child absent for a week or two is alleged by a parent to have been ill during that time. The child when 25 examined is found fairly well. It is impossible to either deny or affirm the truth of the parents' statement. Again, many children are intermittently absent, the parents alleging such complaints as asthma, epilepsy, sick headache and so forth, which recur from time to time only. In such cases it is almost impossible for a medical officer who sees the child only in periods of good health to express a positive opinion as to the actual facts, and the onus of proof should be on the parents, the non-production of a certificate or statement from the medical man alleged to be in attendance during the attacks, regarded as evidence of their unreality. Under the existing scheme the physical examination of children attending school who are not alleged or suspected to be suffering from disease has hardly been attempted. But the issue of the recent memorandum from the Board of Education clearly indicates the lines on which in the future the routine examination of all scholars is to be carried out, and some considerable amplification of the present system is thereby made necessary. The matter will no doubt be considered in due course by the Surrey County Council (the Education Authority for this district), and a fuller scheme elaborated. In the meantime it is interesting and significant to note that the Board of Education attaches the greatest importance to the co-ordination of medical inspection, etc., of scholars with the work of the existing public health service. There is no doubt but that this work of school and scholar inspection will be performed in the future under the direction of County or District Medical Officers of Health, as has been consistently urged by some of us for years past. 26 Mortuary and Coroner's Court. The public mortuary continues to be of great service, but might well be improved and modernized in several particulars. The number of inquests held during 1906 was 45. Baths and Washhouses, etc. There are no public baths and washhouses in Barnes and Mortlake, although Richmond and Putney are provided with these useful institutions. There is no public recreation ground and no free library. The Midwives' Act. I continue, under the arrangement made by the Surrey County Council, to supervise the work of the registered midwives resident in the district, and have recently reported in detail to the County Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Seaton. At present there are but two trained midwives and one untrained but registered person actually practising in the district. Of the 684 births during 1907 about 250 are known to have been attended by one or other of these three, and the results on the whole have been excellent There are several untrained midwives who are not registered who continue to practise, but their cases become apparently fewer year by year. The Richmond Board of Guardians have recently notified midwives practising in this and other districts of the Richmond Union of their willingness to pay a fee of £1 11s. 6d. for medical assistance in suitable cases. As the duty of calling in a medical man is in certain cases now a statutory one, and the Act has made no provision for the remuneration of medical men so called, it is to be hoped that this decision will not in practice be rendered ineffective by too narrow a definition of the cases considered suitable. 28 Appendix A. Special Report under the Factories and Workshops Act, 1901. The statistical particulars officially required in respect of this Act will be found on the pages immediately following this annotation, and, in Appendix C, there is a table giving an analysis of the visits made by the Sanitary Inspectors during 1907. I have myself frequently visited these places, and am satisfied that the provisions of the Act are generally complied with. There has been less difficulty this year in securing the compliance of the few persons in the district employing outworkers, with the Act. The factories and workshops in this district are chiefly laundries, bakehouses, and Shoemakers' and dressmakers' premises. Bye-laws dealing with the provision of means of escape from fire have been prepared, and submitted to the Local Government Board for confirmation. 29 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1907 for the Urban District of Barnes on the administration of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, in connection with FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS, LAUNDRIES, WORKPLACES and HOMEWORK. 1.- INSPECTION.
