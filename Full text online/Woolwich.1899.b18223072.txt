Town Hall, Woolwich, February 2lst, 1900. To The Chairman and. Members of the Woolwich Local Board of Health. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my report upon the Sanitary condition of Woolwich during the year 1899. Mortality Statistics. There have been 902 deaths during the year; of this number 384 occurred in the Dockyard Registration SubDistrict, and 518 in the Arsenal Registration Sub-District. The gross death-rate for the year, estimated upon a population of 41,542 is 21 7 per thousand. Of these deaths, 240 took place in various medical institutions (Table VII.) outside the district; in the appended statistical table they have, however, been allotted to their proper registration sub-districts, and calculated as if taking place within the sanitary area of Woolwich. Thirty-one deaths, occurring within the district, were of persons not rightly belonging to Woolwich; if these be deducted from the total deaths, the correct number of deaths occurring in Woolwich during the twelve months ending the 31st December, 1899, will be obtained, viz., 871. Death Rate. The net death-rate is, therefore, 21.0 per thousand. 2 The following table shows the net death-rate yearly, since the appointment of a Medical Officer of Health for the district on the 29th October, 1889:— 1890 20.5 1891 21.6 1892 19.5 1893 19.7 1894 l8.2 1895 17.4 1896 20.4 1897 17.3 1898 20.1 1899 21.0 The death-rate for 1899 is thus seen to be somewhat higher than that of the preceding year, being the highest since 1891. I have appended Tables, Nos. IX. and X., which show the position taken by Woolwich in this respect as compared with other large towns and with the various Metropolitan Sanitary Districts. Of the total deaths 312 were of children under 5 years, and 590 of persons above that age; of the 312 children, 211 were infants under one year of age. The infantile mortality is, therefore, 167 per 1,000 births:— Total Deaths. Deaths under one year Deaths between the ages of one and five years 1890 838 215 141 1891 885 222 117 1892 806 198 95 1893 828 210 105 1894 755 177 ,i3 1895 748 209 82 1896 860 224 163 1897 720 210 87 1898 870 220 142 1899 902 211 101 3 In Table V. will be found a comparison of the deaths occurring in the Sanitary District of Woolwich during the years 1897, 1898 and 1899, distinguishing those under 5 years of age and those over 5 years of age. Zymotic* Death Rate. The deaths from all causes during the year included 13 from Measles, 4 from Scarlet Fever, 47 from Diarrhcea, 21 from Diphtheria, 12 from Whooping Cough, 6 from Enteric or Typhoid Fever, 31 from Influenza, 2 from Erysipelas, and 4from Puerperal Fever; in all 140 deaths from diseases classified by the Registrar General as Specific Febrile, or Zymotic. This is equivalent to a Zymotic death-rate of 3.4 per thousand. This high rate is due to the increased mortality from Diarrhoea and Influenza, the fatal cases of which numbered respectively 47 and 31, as compared with 38 and n in 1898. The deaths from Diphtheria are also slightly in excess of those in 1898, when their number was 20. Deaths from Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, and Enteric or Typhoid Fever, have fallen from 5, 24 and 8, to 4, 12 and 6, respectively. The Zymotic death-rate for the past ten years is as follows:— 1890 2.5 1891 2.8 1892 2.4 1893 2.6 1894 2.6 1895 1.8 1896 4.2 1897 2.7 1898 3.5 1899 3.4 Phthisis Mortality In lable I., Class IV., 141 deaths are recorded as &c. arising from some form of tubercular disease, of which number 54 occurred in the Dockyard Registration Sub-District, and 87 *As in previous years, the deaths from Influenza, Erysipelas, and Puerperal Fever have been included under this heading. Deducting these deaths 31, 2, and 4 respectively the total number would be 103, and the Zymotic death-rate—from the Principal Zymotic diseases—2-44. See Tables IX and X. 4 in the Arsenal Registration Sub-District. The corresponding figures in 1898 were 61 and 57 respectively, so that the slight excess in the Dockyard Sub-District to which I referred in my last report, was in the year just passed converted into an excess in the Arsenal Sub-District, as in the year 1897, when the figures were 37 and 63. The deaths registered during the past eight years as arising from Tubercular causes were as follows:— 1892 112 1893 121 1894 126 1895 119 1896 124 1897 100 1898 118 1899 141 By far the greater number of Deaths from Tubercular disease are due to Phthisis, as is shown by the following table:— Deaths from Phthisis. Deaths from other Tubercular Diseases. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899.

It will thus be seen that the total deaths both from Phthisis, and other Tubercular diseases for 1899 are the highest on record; it should also be noted that of the 100 deaths from Phthisis, 39 took place in the Union Infirmary. 5.

I would again point out that the want of provision to prevent dampness in many of the older houses in the district tends to perpetuate conditions that are favourable to the spread of tubercular diseases. Sex Mortality. Of the total deaths in the Dockyard Registration SubDistrict, there were 205 males and 179 females; in the Arsenal Registration Sub-District 297 males and 221 females; or, in other words, of the 902 total deaths in the whole district 502 were of males and 400 of females; 100 deaths in the Dockyard Sub-District, and 112 in the Arsenal were of persons over 60 years of age. Inquests and Suicides. There have been 86 Inquests during the year. There have been 6 Suicides as follows :—Hanging 2, Drowning 1, Cutting Throat 1, and Poisoning 2. Mortuary. Seventy-seven bodies were received into the Mortuary, of which 50 were of persons resident in the district, 23 non-resident, and 4 unknown and unidentified. Eighteen were brought in by the Police, and 59 by undertakers, etc. 6 Births and Birth-Rate. The number of births registered during the year was 1,260. Male. Female. Total. Dockyard District 283 248 531 Arsenal District 376 353 729 659 601 1260 Of these 15 were recorded as illegitimate, 10 in the Dockyard District and 5 in the Arsenal. The birth-rate, therefore, 30.3 per thousand, that for the Dockyard being 277 per thousand, and for the Arsenal 32.6. For the past eight years the birth-rate has been as follows:— 1892 29.9 1893 31.3 1894 30.5 1895 30.9 1896 30.5 1897 31.5 1898 30.2 1899 30.3 Marriages. There have been 512 marriages registered during the year; in the first quarter 99, in the second 135, in the third 144, and in the fourth 134. Infectious Disease. During the year 373 cases of infectious disease have )een notified as follows:—(This number not including 3 second notifications.) 7 Dockyard Arsenal Sub-District. Sub-District.

The total number of cases of notifiable Infectious Diseases during the year was the same as in 1898, but considerably less than in 1897. The following table will show the prevalence of the principal Zymotic diseases during the past seven years:— 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 Small-pox 61 15 1 1 2 — 1 Scarlet Fever 259 215 187 144 225 204 168 Diphtheria 24 49 67 99 150 107 142 Typhoid or Enteric Fever 25 14 50 21 18 22 27 Totals 369 293 305 265 395 333 338 Small-pox. One case notified in August, and promptly removed to Hospital, was returned the next day as not being Small-pox. Scarlet Fever. The number of Scarlet Fever notifications for the year was, with the exception of 1896, the lowest for eight years. Forty-nine of the cases were children under 5 years of age. With the exception of 15 instances, patients, or other children in the house, were in attendance at school. The schools most affected were:—Mulgrave Place 30 cases; Wood Street 29; St. Mary's (King Street) 21; Eglinton Road (Plumstead) 19; St. Michael's 17. North Woolwich (Elizabeth Street) had but 6 only ; Military Schools, numbered 1 5. Diphtheria. The increase in the number of cases (being with the exception of 1897 in excess of previous years) is due to two outbreaks. One on the "Warspite" training ship in August; and the other among children attending Elizabeth Street Board School, North Woolwich. Careful inquiries were made in both instances. To the first the attention *In 1899 the diagnosis of Small-pox was disproved. 9 of the Medical Officer of Health to the Port Sanitary Authority (Dr. Collingridge) was drawn; who was of opinion that the first case was imported into the ship, and gave rise to the outbreak. Under his direction the boys were sent home for a fortnight, and the ship thoroughly disinfected. No further cases have arisen. With regard to the cases at Elizabeth Street School, the exact cause of the outbreak could not be traced. The children affected, with two or three exceptions, all lived in one particular area—one street having four cases. It was found on inquiry that the children were in many instances in the habit of playing together, and in some cases of visiting each other's houses. The large room of the Infants' Department, where most of the children were, was closed and thoroughly disinfected. Enteric or Typhoid Fever. Twenty-seven notifications were received, being an increase in the number received yearly for the past four years. Some difficulty was experienced in the removal of these cases in September and October, owing to pressure in hospital accommodation, due to the outbreak in the East London district. Cholera. A supposed case of Cholera was reported from the Seaman's Hospital, Royal Albert Dock. The patient, who had lived for some time in a common lodging house at Woolwich, was found to have died from having eaten castor oil seeds. Measles. A slight outbreak occurred among children attending Maryon Park School. The Infants' department of the school was closed for a week after the Easter holidays. The majority of the children were living in Charlton parish. On reference to the returns of the Metropolitan Asylums Board (see Table XVI.) we get the notifications of the principal infectious 10 diseases received by that Board for the corresponding seven years from the whole of London:— 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 Small-pox 2813 1192 979 225 105 32 29 Scarlet Fever 36901 10655 19757 25647 22876 16894 18112 Diphtheria 13026 18440 10772 13362 12811 11543 13365 Typhoid or Enteric Fever 3663 3360 3506 3190 3113 3024 4458 It will be seen that whilst there are more notifications from Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria and Enteric Fever than in 1898, Scarlet Fever is considerably less than in 1897, and Small-pox has decreased yearly. The notification of Infectious Diseases still continues to work well and without friction. Disinfection. During the year 375 houses and 5849 articles of clothing, bedding, etc., have been disinfected (Table XVII.) Temporary Shelter. Eleven families, represented by 39 persons, were admitted during the year (Table XIX.) Sickness Returns. I append a table giving the sickness returns from various sources during the year (Table XX.) House to House Inspection. During the year the Inspectors have visited 5,009 houses, and made 3,811 re-inspections, these inspections necessitating the issuing of 1,900 notices. Fifty-five streets were inspected house-to-house, the following being some of that number:—Albert Road, North Woolwich ; Beresford Street, Brookhill Road, Church Street, Gildersome Street, High Street, New Road, Prospect Row and Place, Rectory Grove, Ropeyard Rails, Warren Street, etc., etc. 11 In addition to these Inspections and Re-inspections, 256 houses were visited on complaint of drains being choked, etc.; 125 visited for the purpose of drains being tested; 330 where cases of Infectious disease had been notified as occurring; and 129 new houses as to proper water supply. The following figures show the number of inspections (re-inspections not included) made during 1899, compared with the number made during the year previous to the appointment of a Clerk (1895) and ilso during the years 1896, (in the middle of which the appointment was made) 1897, 1898 and 1899.

The Clerical Work in connection with the department during 1899 was fully as heavy as in any preceding year. I append a detailed statement (Table XXIII.) Common Lodging Houses. There are 37 common lodging houses in the district. The control of these houses is under the London County Council. They continue to be well conducted, and the proprietors are willing to co-operate in every way with the Sanitary Officials. Slaughter Houses. There are 6 licensed slaughter-houses in the district. The regulations of the London County Council applying to them are generally observed. I would repeat the hope I expressed in my last Report that, in the interests both of the trade and the public, they will at no distant time all be done away with and replaced by a public Abattoir under the control of the Local Authority. * Also 100 additional samples taken under the Food and Drugs Act. 12 Bakehouses. These have, during the year been systematically visited to secure compliance with the regulations. There are now 40 in the district. The structural defects in many of them are serious, but legal difficulties present a great obstacle in the way of attempting to abolish them. Underground Rooms. With regard to underground rooms generally, due attention continues to be directed to them, and the regulations on the subject are strictly enforced. Houses let in Lodgings. There are 66 houses registered under the Bye-laws (Table XXVII.) and inspections have been systematically made to ensure compliance with the regulations. Rag and Bone Shops. These have been regularly visited, and have called for no special action on the part of the officials. Cow-Sheds, Milk Shops, &c. There is only 1 licensed cow-shed in the district; this, together with the milk shops, etc., has been subjected to constant supervision. The Market. The market has been systematically visited both by night and day. As I have remarked on previous occasions, the meat exposed for sale is at times of somewhat inferior quality. Dust Collection. The pail system continues to work most satisfactorily. The dust is removed weekly from every house in the district, and from some of the streets in the poorer parts of the town twice or thrice weekly. The Destructor provided by the Board continues to work in a most satisfactory manner both by night and day. 13 I again append (Table XXVIII.) a financial statement prepared by Mr. H. O. Thomas, the Surveyor to the Board, relative to its use, which shows a still further saving financially than in the previous year. Public Health (London), 1891, Act. Table XXII. is given, showing the result of the proceedings taken under this Act during the year. Housing of the Working Classes Act. It has not been found necessary to take any action with regard to this measure during the present year. The Baths continue to be extensively used, no less than 136,1,38 bathers having made use of them during the season. The greatest number of bathers in one day was 2,647. The popularity of both the Private and Swimming Baths amongst females continues to increase. During the season 28 Schools attended the Baths for instruction in swimming. 22 Board Schools, and 6 National Schools, Private Schools, etc. The total number of children attending was 16,613. 1,828 persons also attended in connection with the Evening Continuation (male) Classes. Sanitary and other Improvements. The following are the principal improvements to be recorded during the past year:— 1. The erection of a public urinal at Wellington Street. Application has been also made for a loan for the construction of an underground convenience for both sexes, at the Nile Street approach to the Woolwich Free Ferry. 2. The near completion of the new Mortuary and Disinfecting Shelter in Sun Street. 3. The erection of the Board's new Stables at Callis Alley Yard. The old site at Market Street will be utilised for the New Free Library. 14 4. The rebuilding of houses in the district is being continued, Hare Street, Powis Street, William Street, Brewer Street, etc., being practically re-built. Mention should also be made of a new block of model dwellings near the Lord Howick, Woolwich Road. 5. The completion of the pumping station and reservoirs, etc., and the construction of the main sewer in connection with North Woolwich Drainage, the whole scheme of which is now approaching completion. I have, in conclusion, to acknowledge my indebtedness to the Committee for their continued support, and to the Sanitary Inspectors for their loyal co-operation, and the conscientious discharge of their respective duties. To Mr. J. A. Arnold, the Clerk of the Department, my thanks are especially due, for the very able manner in which he has discharged his duties. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM R. SMITH, M.I)., Medical Officer of Health. 15 TABLE I.

Surveyor's Report upon the cost of disposal of Refuse at the Destructor, Dockyard Wharf Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in presenting my Sixth Annual Report of the working of the Refuse Destructor for the period of One Year ended December 1st, 1898. The quantity of refuse that passed through the cells during that period amounted to 11,012 loads, equal to 27,030 cubic yards. The cost of the disposal of which, under the old system of barging away at 1s. 6d. per cubic yard, would have been (calculating each load to represent 2½ cubic yards) £2,027 5s. 0d. 548 tons (estimated) Fishmongers' and Butchers' Offal were also destroyed during the year, being a decrease of 43 tons upon the quantity destroyed last year. The outgoings of the Destructor, including Capital and Interest 011 Loans Wages, Breeze for Cremator, Gas, Water, and other expenses, were as follows:— £ s. d. £ s. d.
