Patteson, Esq.,) attended and viewed the property, after which, he made order upon the owner for the cleansing and repair of the said houses, and the same have since bee put into a better sanitary condition, the drainage of several of the houses has also been improved, and an extra length of drain and two gulleys have been provided by the Vestry to take the surface water from the street. Fever, Prevention of. A communication having been received from Dr. Simon, Medical Officer of the Privy Council, with reference to the prevalence of Scarlatina and Fever in the Metropolis, the 18 Medical Officer of Health of this parish, at the request of the Vestry drew up a table of suggestions for the mitigation and prevention of the spreading of Scarlatina and Fever, which were printed and circulated throughout the parish An assistant Inspector of Nuisances was also temporarily appointed to assist the Medical Officer of Health and Inspector of Nuisances in a systematic inspection of the houses of the poor, with the view to the immediate abatement of all causes of nuisance that might be found to exist, in consequence of which, a large number of notices, under the " Nuisances Removal Act," were served upon the owners of small houses, whereupon the cause of nuisance was in most instances promptly removed. Five notices to make drains from dwelling houses to covered sewers, and twenty-eight notices to provide ashpits, and water supply to closets, have been served by order of the Vestry. Slaughter House Licenses. Fifteen notices were in September last received from butchers and others of their intention to apply to the Special Sessions for licenses for their slaughter houses, and the same having been severally inspected by the Medical Officer of Health, the Vestry, upon the report of that Officer, opposed an application made by Mr. Charles Knight for a slaughter house in Seven Step-alley (formerly in the occupation of Mr. Spencer), in consequence of the premises not being in a proper state, and the Magistrates accordingly refused to grant a license for the same, the other fourteen Slaughter-houses were all duly licensed. Cow Houses. The four Cow houses heretofore licensed in this parish were relicensed by the Magistrates in October last, and two fresh applications for licenses for Cowhouses situate in Clark's Orchard and Albion-street respectively, were also granted. Millpond Reservoir. Complaints having been made to the Vestry from time to time of the offensive smell arising from the Reservoir belonging to the Surrey Flour Mill, West Lane, the Vestry called the attention of the owners of the Mill thereto, and urged that the bottom ofthe Reservoir be paved and kept properly flushed, in order to prevent the water becoming foul and stagnant. The bottom of the Reservoir has since been layed with brick upon concrete by Messrs. Perks, which it is hoped will abate the nuisance complained of. Foi further particulars as to Sanitary matters, see the Medical Officer of Health's Annual Report hereto amiexed, Appendix No. 1. Financial. The loadn of £800 borrowed of Mr. Samuel Brandon for Sewers Works, has been paid off, and the amount re-borrowed as follows, viz:-£600 of Mr. Edward Talbot, and £200 of Mr. Edmond George Dannell, upon mortgages of the Sewers Rates of this parish, such sums to be respectively repaid by equal annual instalments, within a period of ten years, with interest at\ £5 per cents. per annum £800 has been paid off the Paving borrowed of Mr. J. W. Barrett, leaving £1,200 to be repaid by yearly instalments of £200 each, with interest at £5 per cent per annum. 19 £94-6 45. 0d. has been paid off the Loan borrowed of Mr. Robert Lawrence, for paving the carriageways Union-road and Deptford Lower Road, leaving £8,515 16s. 0d., to be repaid by equal annual instalments, within a period of nineteen years, with interest at £5 per cent, per annum. Two Loans of £l,500 each have been obtained from Mr. Edmond George Dannell and Mr. Edward Talbot, on mortgages of the Paving and General Purposes Rates of this Parish, to defray the expenses of the Improvement Works, Jamaica Level, and the making up and paving certain new streets, such Loans to be repaid within a period of twenty years, with interest thereon at £5 per cent, per annum. The Vestry have determined to set aside a sum of £150 yearly, to form a sinking fund to pay off the last mentioned Loans, at the expiration of the said term of twenty years. Charity Estates, &c.

Jamaica Level Improvement. The Improvement and Paving Works on the site ofthe old Mill Stream, J amaica Level, have been carried out and completed by this Vestry at a total cost (including site), of £1694 5a 6d of which amount the Metropolitan Board of Works contributed £-60, and the vestiv of Bermondsey £275, thus leaving the sum of £1159 -5s. 6d. to be defrayed by this Vestiy. Boundary Roads. The completion of the proposed new agreement with the Vestry of Bermondsey, for maintaining, cleansing, and watering the boundary roads West Lane, Jamaica Level, Manoiroad, and Rotherhithe New-road, stands over for the present. Urinal, Jamaica Level. An iron urinal for six persons is about to be erected in the centre of the road, Jamaica Level, opposite the side front of the "Queen Charlotte" P.II.,at or about twenty feet from the footpath of Jamaica-road, at the joint expense of the Vestry of Bermondsey and this Vestry, the repair and future maintenance thereof will also be borne by the two V estries in equal moieties, and a contract has been entered into with Mr. Jennings, Sanitary Engineer, for the erection thereof, which is to be carried out under the direction ofthe Vestry of Bermondsey. New Roads and Streets. The Metropolitan Board of Works have approved of the formation of the following new roads and streets in this parish, viz.:— Two new roads, 40 feet wide, branching out of Rotherhithe New-road, by South London Railway Station, to be called " Granliam-road" and " Parfitt-road," together with a connecting road, also 40 feet wide, at the end of the same. Five new streets, 40 feet wide, to be respectively called " Tissington-street," " Warndenstreet, " Westlake-road," " Silverlock-street," and " Silwood-street," and the continuation of an existing street to be named " Luxford-street," in connection with the Rotherhithe Branch New Road. i Also six new roads, 40 feet wide, leading out of Jamaica Level and Rotherhithe Newroad, to be respectively called " Abbeyfield - road," " Aspinden - road," " Nelldale - road," M ossmgton-road, " Pedworth-road," and " Ray mouth-road." Mr. Thome's Forecourts, New Road. It appearing to the Vestry that on the erection of two houses in the Rotherhithe New road, near the South London Railway Station, the forecourts of the houses were brought out too far, an encroacied upon the public footpath there, and the owner having declined to make any alteration a summons was taken out at the Greenwich Police Court against Mr. Thorne, the Leaseholder Builder, in respect of such encroachment; the case was partly heard on the 13th April last, and adjourned to the 27th April, for the Magistrate to view the locality, in the meantime. The Magistrate ultimatelydecided that the Forecourts were not improperly erected, and consequently dismissed the summons, but offered to give the Vestry a case for the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench . The Vestry however, resolved to take no further steps in the matter 21 Opening Southwark Park. Southwark Park, in this parish, was opened to the public on the 19th June, 1869 by Sir John Thwaites, Chairman of the Metropolitan Board of Works, in the presence of the Members of that Board, the Members of Parliament for the Borough of Southwark, the Justices of the Peace for the County of Surrey, the 4th Surrey Administrative Battalion of Rifle Volunteers, and the Vestrymen of the parishes of St. George the Martyr, Bermondsey, St. John's, St. Olave's, and Rotherhithe, together with a large assembly of the inhabitants of this and the neighbouring parishes. The following is a memorandum prepared by the Superintending Architect of the Metropolitan Board of Works, relative to the formation and cost of the Park:— Southwark Park opened 19th June, 1869. The Metropolitan Board of Works, impressed with the importance of securing for the densely-populated portion of the Metropolis along the southern side of the River Thames, in the parishes of Bermondsey and Rotherhithe, proceeded in 1864, under the powers conferred on them by the 10th section of the Metropolis Management Amendment Act of 1856, to obtain from Parliament the necessary powers for the formation of a Park. The Bill provided for the purchase of about sixty-two acres of land in the parish of St. Mary, Rotherhithe, and for the formation and maintenance of a Park, to be called Southwark Park, for the use, recreation, and enjoyment of the public, and also for the sale or leasing of such portions of the land as the Board might not require for the purposes of the Park, and for raising the necessary funds. The Bill passed through both Houses of Parliament without opposition, and received the Royal assent on the 28th April, 1864. About sixty-three acres of land, then used as market gardens, were selected as a suitable site, situated near the Spa Road Railway Station, between Paradise-row, Rotherhithe, the Deptford Lower Road, and Rotherhithe New Road, about one mile from London Bridge, and within easy walking distance from the crowded parts of the parishes of Southwark, Horselydown, and Bermondsey. The land chiefly belonged to Field-Marshal Sir William Gomm, G.C.B., and the negociations for the purchase of the freehold were difficult and prolonged, but were at length concluded in 1865; afterwards, the claims for the yearly tenancies and other minor interests had to be settled, and possession of the whole property obtained. Plans for laying out the ground were then prepared, and contracts made for enclosing the Park, forming the surface and walks, building lodges, and planting trees and shrubs. The expenditure for the land, and other costs, has been as follows:— £ s. d. For freehold and leasehold interests 68398 11 2 Professional and other charges, and wages 5330 18 5 Incidentals 722 19 2 Contracts for works, for entrance lodges, gates, enclosure pailings, formation of roads, &c., drainage of roads, and planting 20710 2 6 Total to 25th March, 1869 £95162 11 3 22 The cost of the freehold land was about £911 per acre for 60 acres. There are 16 acres reserved for building purposes, as shown by the etched blocks for sites of buildings on the accompanying plan, to recoup the Ratepayers of the Metropolis in respect of the above expenditure. (Signed) GEORGE VULLIAMY, Superintending Architect." Water Supply. The Vestry having received a Memorial from the inhabitants of Chilton-street, and numerous complaints from residents in other parts of this parish, relative to the scantiness of the supply of water to their houses by the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company, another memorial was presented to the Board of Trade, urging inquiry into the grounds of such complaints, with the view of having the same remedied, upon which Captain Tyler, R. E., again attended on the part of that Board, and inspected several houses in various parts of this parish in reference to the said complaints. Captain Tyler afterwards reported fully to the Board of Trade as to the state of the water service of each house visited by him, and that in some instances the complaints were well founded, and in others the fittings were found to be faulty; also, "that it would be for the Board of Trade to take such steps with regard to the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company as they might deem necessary, in order to prevent a re-occurrence of the constant complaints which were very discreditable to the Company." The Vestry have since received from the Board of Trade a copy of a reply made by the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company to the said report of Captain Tyler, as follows:— Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company, Sumner Street, Southwark. 20th September, 1869. SIR, I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated 10th inst., enclosing copy of the Report of Captain Tyler to the Board of Trade on a memorial presented from the inhabitants of Rotherhithe, complaining of a short supply of water, and requesting to know what means this Company proposed to take to remedy the evil complained of. In reply, I am instructed to inform you, that the Directors of this Company have for some time past been making provision to afford an increased supply of water to the whole of their district by the construction of entirely new works at Hampton, comprising a Depositing Reservoir of three and a half acres area, three Filtering Beds, having a joint area of three acres, and two engines of 450 horse-power. At Battersea the Company are also constructing an additional subsiding Reservoir, capable of containing 27,000,000 gallons. The new Hampton works are now practically completed, and within a week or two will be in regular working order. A new line of 30inch main has also been laid to connect them with the western portion of the Company's district, comprising Battersea, Wandsworth, Putney, Barnes, Mortlake, Sheen, Wimbledon, Roehampton, Richmond, and I etersham, which will then be supplied entirely from the new Hampton Works, thus relieving the Battersea Works from supplying the above districts, and rindering the surplus power thus created available for the increasing requirements of the eastern portion of the Company's district in which Rotherhithe is situated. 23 With regard to the special instances referred to by Captain Tyler, the Company have, in accordance with his recommendations, re-arranged the services as follows, viz.:— In Chilton-street a new service has been laid for a distance of 160 yards, and in those cases where the fault arises from defects in the house service pipes, the landlords have had notice to alter or repair them. The position of the stopcocks on the service pipe supplying Mr. Buhner's house, in Lower-road, Rotherhithe, and Mr. Sutton, Almond Tree House, have been altered, and the waste reduced from the low services. In Dartmouth-terrace the ground has been opened, and larger connections made between the Company's pipes and the house service pipes. In Park-terrace, Manor-road, the service has been divided into two parts. In addition to the above, the Company are laying a new line of 7-inch main from their Trunk Main in the Blue Anchor-road, to the main in the Deptford Lower-road, to assist the general pressure in the district. With respect to the Sunday supply, the Company have for some time past given to the greater portion of their district a supply of water on that day, and now that the new works are in operation at Hampton, it will be generally adopted. The Directors feel confident that as soon as the above works are carried out, the Memorialists will have no further ground of complaint of want of a thoroughly good supply of water; and they trust that these explanations will be satisfactory to the Board of Trade, and convince them that, as far as the Company are concerned, everything will be done to ensure a good supply of water to their tenants; but much depends upon the co-operation of the Vestry in compelling the landlords, especially of small property, to provide proper pipes, cisterns, and fittings to the houses, from the absence of which in many cases the complaints referred to in the Memorial have arisen. I am, &c., (Signed) CHARLES ROBINSON, Secretary. To the Assistant Secretary, Railway Department, Board of Trade, London. On reference to the published account of Receipt and Expenditure of the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company, annexed hereto, (Appendix No. 2,) it will be seen that a sum of £122,964 10s. 5d. was expended by the said Company on new work and extension of services, during the year ending 30th September, 1869. Poor Rate Assessment and Collection Act. The "Poor Rate Assessment and Collection Act, 1869," (32 and 33 Vict., c. 41) having been considered by the Vestry, they directed the Overseers of the Poor to carry out the provision contained in the 3rd section of the said Act, in this parish, which is to the effect that " In case the rateable value of any hereditament does not exceed £20, if the hereditament is situate in the Metropolis, * * * * and the owner of such hereditament is willing to enter into an agreement in writing with the Overseers, to become liable to them 24 for the poor rates assessed in respect of such hereditament, for any term not being less than one year from the date of such agreement, and to pay the Poor Rates, whether the hereditament is occupied or not. The Overseers may, subject nevertheless to the control of the Vestry agree with the owner to receive the rates from him, and to allow him a commission not exceeding 25 per cent. on the amount thereof." Sanitary Staff. The Medical Officer of Health having called attention to the want of permanent help in his department, in consequence of the increased amount of Sanitary work that had to be performed, and the Vestry finding that Mr. Joseph John Sanders's services as Assistant Relieving Officer would no longer be required by the Guardians of St. Olave's Union, and that he could in consequence, give the whole of his time to the duties of his office as Inspector of Nuisances and Street Keeper; the Vestry, in consideration of his so doing, increased his salary from £73 to £115 per annum, commencing from the 25th March, 1870. APPENDIX No. 1. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, From 1st April, 1869, to 31st March, 1870. The Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, Surrey. Gentlemen, The annual statement I now submit to you does not represent the sanitary condition of the parish so favorably as I have had the pleasure of reporting on some former occasions ; the continued depression of some branches of trade, and the mysterious operation of agencies \\ hich occasion disease, have caused a diminution in the number of births, and an increase in the number of deaths. It is invariably found that epidemic diseases contribute very largely to the number of deaths , some of the diseases in this class are fever of the continued type, small pox, scarlatina, whooping cough, measles, diarrhoea, and cholera. Fever, diarrhoea, and cholera are common to all periods of life, and may affect the individual more than once; but small pox, scarlatina, whooping cough, and measles, are supposed to arise from a specific cause, are common to the young, and usually occur only once during life; there is, however, this difference in diseases peculiar to all ages, that many persons escape them altogether, whilst the susceptibility to diseases of the young is so great that very few escape having them once in the course of life. 25 The following table will show the fluctuations in the mortality of epidemic diseases, and although we appear to be never free from them, there is a great difference annually in their intensity and decline:— Disease. 1866 Annual Reports Extracts. 1870 Deaths. 1867 1868 1869 Fever 17 10 12 15 13 67 Small Pox 4 18 6 3 5 36 Scarlatina 6 14 4 10 124 158 Measles 22 4 12 19 7 64 Whooping Cough 36 21 12 29 22 120 Diarrhœa 28 18 20 29 25 120 Cholera, Asiatic ... 21 ... ... ... 21 113 106 66 105 196 586 Fever of the continued type was fatal in thirteen cases. One of these was registered as relapsing fever: a kind of disease which has been said to be prevalent in some parts of London, and fatal in many instances. In this parish we have had very little experience of it. Small pox. The introduction of vaccination has exercised considerable influence in the prevention of small pox, five deaths only having been registered. Scarlatina. The most marked feature of the year was the extreme prevalence of scarlet fever. It is a highly infectious disease, and very destructive to infantile life. In four previous years it was destructive to thirty-four lives, and in the year which this report includes, it caused 124 deaths. From April 1st to June 30th, thirteen deaths were registered; July 1st to September 30th, thirty-four deaths; October 1st to December 31st, sixty-three deaths; January 1st, 1870, to March 31st, fourteen deaths. Scarlatina was very widespread, and I believe unusually fatal in its effects; it is, however, impossible to declare the proportion of deaths to recoveries with exactness. The epidemic was sometimes attended with acute affections of the brain, which terminated life in a few hours, and dropsy was a frequent sequel. In consequence of the presence of this disease, the Vestry appointed an additional Inspector of Nuisances for a few weeks, who did good service in the inspection of houses, circulating useful hints of prevention to the inhabitants, and attending to other sanitary matters. Measles. The Mortality from this disease was low, seven deaths having been registered. Whooping cough is a disease which destroys more lives among children than some other epidemic diseases, it is more uniform in its fatal effects, and twenty-five deaths were registered. Diarrhoea caused 25 deaths, all under two years of age, save one. Diseases of the respiratory organs always contribute largely to the number of deaths; there have been registered fifty-three deaths from bronchitis, twenty-two from Pneumonia, and seventy-three from Phthisis, a few more might be added, which would raise the aggregate to more than a fourth part of the whole number of registered deaths. In other classes of disease, the number of deaths will be found about the average of former years. 26 Nine hundred and twelve births were registered, four hundred and sixty-ore males and four hundred and fifty-one females; compared with the former year, it will appear that the births are less by thirty-seven, and have exceeded the deaths by two hundred and fifty-one. Six hundred and seventy-nine deaths were registered, three hundred and forty-seven males, and three hundred and thirty-two females, viz.:- From April 1, 1869, to June 30, 1869 137 „ June 30, 1869, to Sptember 30, 1869 173 „ October 30 ,1869, to December 31,1869 207 „ January 1, 1870, to March 31, 1870 162 679 Thirty-eight Coroner's Inquests have been held, in eighteen cases the persons had not resided here, which will reduce the number of deaths to six hundred and sixty-one. The following table will shew the rate of mortality in reference to the two previous vears: — No. of deaths. Corrected mortality, Per thousand. From March 31, 1869, to April 1, 1870 679 661 22.19 „ „ 31, 1868, to „ 1,1869 599 580 20.0 „ „ 31, 1867, to „ 1,1868 530 507 17.14 The mortality tables will prove deaths according to age as follows:—Under two years, 332; from 2 to five years, 111; from 5 to 10 years, 61; from 10 to 20 years, 20; from 20 to 30 years, 29; from 30 to 40 years, 46; from 40 to 50 years, 44; from 50 to 60 years, 40; from 60 to 70 years, 44; from 70 to 80 years, 34; from 80 to 90 years, 16, from 90 to 100 years, 2. From the causes already enumerated, I am inclined to think the population has not much increased during the year; it is therefore my purpose to estimate the fixed and floating population of the parish at twenty-nine thousand. Various forms of Nuisance have required our interference, and two hundred and fifty notices have been served. We have had to deal largely with dilapidated and dirty houses, and some of the proprietors proved so intractable as to require the interposition of a Magistrate, this led to several visits to the Greenwich Police Court, but the trouble has been rewarded by the accomplishment of the object we had in view. A memorial, signed by several inhabitants living in different parts of the Parish, complaining of a short supply of water, was sent to the Vestry, and forwarded to the Board of Trade, and Captain Tyler, on the part of the Board of Trade, accompanied by the Engineer of the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company and myself, were engaged more than five hours in visiting some of the houses from whence complaints had been made, and Captain Tyler in his report, strongly recommended a supply of water on Sundays, and made other suggestions, which have been acted on, and removed in great measure the ground of complaint. The supply of the Kent Water Company has been satisfactory. 27 The cow-houses and slaughterhouses have been visited in respect to the renewal of their Licenses and at other times; and their condition could not be complained of. Various inspections of the Bakehouses have also been made, and at the time of our visits no fault could be found. The Workshops have been visited so far as their number could be ascertained, and a return forwarded to Her Majesty's Inspector of Factories. The dusting and Scavengers' duties have been performed tolerably well. Your continued kind assistance to me in the discharge of my duties, and the ready cooperation of my colleagues, demand my best thanks. Yours respectfully, SAMUEL TILLEY Rotherhithe, August, 1870. 28 TABLE OF THE MORTALITY IN ROTHERHITHE. First Quarter, from April 1st, 1869, to June 30th, 1869. Diseases.
