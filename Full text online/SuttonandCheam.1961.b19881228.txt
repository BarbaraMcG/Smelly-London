Analytical and Consulting Chemist (Part-time) 1 TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE BOROUGH OF SUTTON AND CHEAM Mr. Mayor. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the Annual Report on the Health of the Borough for the year 1961. It has been prepared in accordance with Ministry of Health Circular No 1/62. The estimated population showed a decrease of one thousand eight hundred and eighty The birth rate was again higher at 14.13 per thousand of population (14.7 adjusted), compared with 13.56 per thousand of population (13.97 adjusted) in 1960. The death rate increased to 12.48 per thousand of population (11.36 adjusted) from 11.27 per thousand of population (10.8 adjusted) in 1960. The main increases were in deaths from malignant disease, coronary thrombosis and bronchitis There was no maternal death for the third year running. There was a higher incidence of infectious disease, almost entirely due to 1961 being a Measles epidemic year. There was no case of Diphtheria, Meningococcal Infection, nor,, for the third year running, of Poliomyelitis. There was one case of Paratyphoid Fever There was an increase in new cases of pulmonary Tuberculosis notified in 1961 over the very low figure for 1960, but the number is still well below the figure for 1959. A mobile Mass Miniature Radiography Unit visited the Borough from 7th to 24th November, 1961 and was stationed at the Public Hall, Sutton. Housing remains the Borough's chief problem. No new houses or flats were provided during the year, but thirty-six were under construction as at 31st December, 1961 In addition, forty-five houses or flats were in an advanced stage of preparation and will be started in 1962. It is also hoped to start on a further scheme for approximately two hundred units during 1962.. A further approximately six hundred units are being planned for future development. During the year the relief surface water sewer in Sutton High Street between Benhill Avenue and Burnell Road, and the relief surface water sewer in Morden Way have been completed, and will help to overcome flooding in one or two areas of the Borough sometimes affected. In the latter part of the year work commenced on the construction of the Cuddington Way soil relief sewer. The water supply of the district was maintained at a high standard of chemical and bacteriological purity, and the excellent co-operation of the staff of the Sutton District Water Company continued The work of sanitary supervision of the district and of the protection of food was efficiently carried out during the year under the direction of the Chief Public Health Inspector. I thank him for his helpful collaboration and report, and also the inspectorial, clerical and outdoor staff of the Health Department for the work they have done during the year. 2 My work has again been facilitated by the continued co-operation from the County staff at all levels, from Hospital and Laboratory staffs, and particularly from the general practitioners of the district. This also remains true of the Council Chief Officers and their staffs. Finally, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I should like to express my thanks for the support you have given me during the year. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN C. BIRCHALL, Medical Officer of Health 3 SUMMARY OF VITAL STATISTICS FOR 1961 Area in acres 4338.15 Population: Registrar General's Estimate of the Resident Population (at 30th June, 1961) 77,980 Census, 1961 78,969 Number of inhabited houses (end of year) according to the Rate Book 25,571 Rateable Value £l,656,149 Product of a Penny Rate £6,807 Males Females Total Live Births 586 516 1102 Legitimate 560 499 1059 Illegitimate 26 17 43 Illegitimate Live Births per cent of total Live Births 3.90 Live Birth Rate per 1000 of the Estimated Resident Population: Crude: 14.13 As adjusted by comparability factor (1.04) 14.7 (England & Wales 17.4 ) Still Births 13 9 22 Legitimate 13 8 21 Illegitimate 0 1 1 Still Birth Rate per 1000 total (live and still births) 19.6 (England & Wales 18.7 ) Deaths 422 551 973 Death Rate per 1000 of the Estimated Resident Population: Crude: 12.48 As adjusted by comparability factor (0.91) 11.36 (England & Wales 12.0 ) Deaths from Sepsis 0 Other Maternal Causes 0 Death Rate from Maternal Causes per 1000 total (live and still births) 0.00 (England & Wales 0 33) Deaths of Infants under one year of age: All Infants per 1000 live births 15.4 (England & Wales 21.4 ) Legitimate Infants per 1000 legitimate live births 14.2 Illegitimate Infants per 1000 illegitimate live births 46.5 Neo-natal Mortality rate (under 4 weeks) 13.6 (England & Wales 15.5 ) Early Neo-natal Mortality rate (under 1 week) 12.7 Perinatal Mortality Rate (still birth deaths under 1 week) per 1000 total live and still births 32.0 4 CAUSES OF DEATH IN THE BOROUGH OF SUTTON AND CHEAM DURING 1961 M.

The infantile mortality rate was 15.4 per thousand live births, compared with, 21.4 per thousand live births for England and Wales. Of the seventeen deaths, fifteen occurred in the neo-natal period within one month of birth, fourteen being within the first week, as is shown in the following table of causes and age groups. AGE GROUPS Causes of Death 0-1 Week 1-4 Weeks 1-12 Months Prematurity 8 0 0 Congenital Abnormality 4 0 0 Other causes 2 1 2 TOTALS 14 1 2 NEW LEGISLATION (1) Public Health Act, 1961 This Act came into force on the 3rd October, 1961 and is an Act to amend the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1936, relating to building byelaws and makes such amendments of the law relating to public health matters as are commonly made in local Acts, and also amends the law relating to trade effluents. It also gives some additional powers in the control of Infectious Diseases and makes compensation for loss of work obligatory in certain circumstances connected with infectious diseases. 6 (2} Bousing Act, 1961 This Act came into force on the 24th November, 1961 and made further arrangements for the giving of financial assistance for the provision of housing accommodation, conferred further powers on local authorities as regards houses let in lodgings or in multiple occupation, and houses or other buildings affected by clearance and demolition orders. The Act also amends the law relating to improvement and standard grants made under the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958 etc. (3) Consumer Protection Act, 1961 This Act came into force on the 19th August 1961 and makes provision for the protection of consumers. It repeals the Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952, and the Oil Burners (Standards) Act, 1960. HEALTH EDUCATION Apart from the health education given by all members of the staff during their routine visits, the following subjects have been dealt with:- (i) One talk was given by the Medical Officer of Health to a Junior Red Cross group, on Home Safety. The Chief Public Health Inspector gave two talks to political organisations, on the work of the Public Health Inspectors. (ii) Posters on Food Hygiene were obtained in July for public Notice Boards and for distribution in food premises by the Public Health Inspectors. In June assistance was again given to the Divisional Medical Officer's drive for Home Helps, by a display of posters. Publicity in connection with the Mass Miniature Radiography Unit's visit to Sutton was given in November, (iii) Articles were written by the Medical Officer of Health in a ratepayers gazette on Chronic Bronchitis First Aid in the Home: Footwear and Care of the Feet, and Survival and Nuclear Warfare. (iv) A one day Conference run by the Central Council for Health Education, entitled The Road to Maturity, was attended by the Chairman of the Health Committee and the Medical Officer of Health in January. It was concerned with the problems of adolescence and health education of teenagers. (v) The Sutton and Cheam Home Safety Committee, which is a voluntary committee supported by a grant from the Council, under its President, Alderman Mrs. Sparks, and Chairman, Mr. Powers Wallis, did much valuable work on health education on Home Safety matters. Many thousands of interesting and instructive posters, leaflets, bookmarks and the like were distributed, and speakers were provided on Home Safety subjects to the British Red Cross Society, schools, and numerous local organisations. 7 Special efforts were made during World Health Week in April, which was on Safety in the Home, and National Fire Prevention Week in November. An exhibition was staged in connection with the latter. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS One hundred and one medical examinations of staff were undertaken during the year, consisting of eighty eight for superannuation purposes and thirteen sick pay cases for reports to the Establishment Committee. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACTS, 1948 and 1951 Section 47 (Removal of Persons in Heed of Care and Attention) Four persons were dealt with under this Section of the Act. All were old ladies. Two of them were sisters, aged 70 and 73, under observation from 1960, one of whom was nearly blind due to cataract, and the other was subnormal and also had poor vision. They were living in very insanitary conditions. A Court Order was obtained for their removal to hospital. Operations have been carried out on the almost blind sister, and her vision is now much better; and some improvement has been made in the other sister's vision, also by operation. They have settled down well, and it was not considered necessary to renew the Order. A third old lady, aged 76 or 77, who was living alone, was very confused, and a Court Order was obtained following representations by her son and her doctor for her admission to a private old people's home. She settled down extremely well and looked very much better after admission Again it was not considered necegsary to renew the Order. She died over six months after removal. The fourth old lady, aged about 84, was visited following a report that she had not been seen about. She was found lying on the bedroom floor, and although obviously in need of hospital attention, she refused to go. As she had no doctor, a local general practitioner kindly agreed to see her, and an emergency Order was obtained for her admission to hospital the same day. She died fourteen days after admission, from a malignant disease- Apart from the above, nine old people came to notice during the year, of whom four went into hospital, one went into an old people's home and four were able to manage at home. In addition, ten old people continued under observation from the previous year, of whom two died during 1961, two were admitted to hospital, one was admitted to an old people's home, one was transferred to an old person's flat and four were able to manage at home. Section 50 (Burial and Cremation of the Dead) One burial was arranged under the powers granted to the Council by this Section. 8 MORTUARY During 1961, two hundred and four bodies were admitted and underwent post mortem examination. Seventy three of the bodies were admitted from hospitals, and sixteen from houses in other local authority areas The year 1961 was the first year of operation of the New Mortuary and the working conditions proved an agreeable change from those of the old Mortuary. The mortuary trolley proved difficult to operate and the possibility of getting a hydraulic trolley was being considered at the end of the year, LABORATORIES The Public Health Laboratory, Epsom, served the Borough for bacteriological examinations. Dr. D.R. Gamble took over the control of this Laboratory during the year and has maintained an excellent service. This service is supplemented by the use of the laboratories at Sutton and Cheam Hospital and St. Helier Hospital. Approximately one hundred and seventeen specimens connected with infectious diseases were submitted to the laboratories during the year CLINICS Details of the clinics available in the district are given at the end of this report. (Pages 55 and 56) SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply. The water supply is mainly derived from the deep wells in the chalk of the Sutton District Water Company situated at Sutton, Cheam and Woodmansterne. A small area in the North Ward is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board. The water from all the wells of the Sutton District Water Company is softened to under nine degrees of hardness. A high dose of chlorine in the form of chloramine is administered to the water as a protective measure Most of it is removed later, leaving a small residual chloramine to pass out to public distribution. The water is not liable to be plumbo-solvent. Almost thirty-six gallons of water per person per day were supplied in 1961, of which just over seven gallons were supplied to trade, and almost twenty nine gallons were used domestically. The amount of water used during the year was a record, the previous highest consumption being in 1959. In 1961 the rainfall was 2½ per cent. below the standard average for the area 9 Samples of the raw and treated waters are examined daily by the laboratory at the Sutton Works Samples are also examined at monthly intervals by the Company's Consultant Analyst, and copies of his reports are received Twenty four bacteriological and twelve chemical samples are taken annually by five Distract Councils in the area of supply (two bacteriological and one chemical per month, in rotation) All samples were satisfactory. The supply from all sources has been satisfactory in quality and quantity. No action was necessary in respect of contamination during the year. All the dwelling houses have a direct supply from the public ntains, as follows (a) Twenty five thousand, seven hundred and forty nine houses, with a population of seventy seven thousand, nine hundred and seventy, are supplied to a tap directly into the house (b) Five houses, with a population of ten, are supplied by stand-pipes. The Sutton District Water Company supply twenty five thousand, three hundred and ten dwellings, and the remaining four hundred and forty four dwellings are supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board. The following is the average of monthly analyses :- Chemical Results in Parts per Million Average Appearance Bright with a slight white deposit of minute particles of calcium carbonate Turbidity Less than 3 Colour Nil Odour Nil PH 8.53 Free Carbon Dioxide Trace Electric Conductivity 279.16 Dissolved Solids dried at 180°C. 213.3 Chlorine present as Chloride 20.5 Alkalinity as Calcium Carbonate 39.16 Hardness (grains per gallon) - Carbonate 2.75 Non-carbonate 5.15 Total 7.90 Nitrate Nitrogen 10.7 Nitrite Nitrogen 0.0 Ammoniacal Nitrogen 0.14 Albuminoid Nitrogen 0.0 Oxygen Absorbed 0.10 Residual Chlorine 0.13 Metals - Iron, Zinc, Copper and Lead Absent Bacteriological Results No. of colonies developing on Agar per ml. for 3 days at 20 C. 1.0 No of colonies developing on Agar per ml. for 1 day at 37° C 0.0 Presence of Bacillus Coli in 100 ml 0.0 10 Swimming Baths There are two public swimming baths in Sutton and Cheam The Maiden Road Bath, Cheam, was opened in 1938, and so is reasonably modern. It is open between April and September, and in Winter it is converted into a fine public hall. The Throwley Road Bath, Sutton, is much older and has changing cubicles round the sides of the bath. It is open all the year round. Maiden Road Bath Throwley Road Bath Maximum Clothes Accommodation 312 250 Quantity of Water 150,000 gallons 70,000 gallons Treatment Cycle Time 3½ hours 3½ hours Both work on a continuous cycle of- pressure filtration and chlorination, the actual water being emptied out once a year and the Baths being refilled with mains water. Records are kept at both Baths showing the number of bathers, water temperature and residual chlorine levels at various times during the day and from these it was clear that an adequate degree of chlorination was being maintained. Three bacteriological and one chemical sample were taken from the Throwley Road Bath, and three bacteriological samples from Maiden Road Bath. All seven samples were reported as satisfactory. In addition, there is a learner swimming bath at Avenue Road County Primary School, Belmont Rise, Belmont. A small pressure filter and chlorinator was in use and a complete circulation of water was obtained every eight hours. Four samples of the water were taken for bacteriological examination, and were found to be satisfactory. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE Worcester Park Sewage Disposal Works. Emptying of the original sludge digestion tank proceeded during the year and preparations were made for the repair of the tank mechanisms. The design of the Stage III of the Reconstruction Scheme has proceeded and tenders have been invited for the supply of part of the equipment. The design of the first section of sludge beds is nearing completion and construction will commence in 1962. The effluent being discharged to the Beverley Brook is of reasonable quality. Sutton Sewage Disposal Works. During the year improvements have been made to the tertiary treatment unit. The effluent discharged to the Pyl Brook is normally of good quality. 11 Drainage. During the year the relief surface water sewer in Sutton High Street, between Benhill Avenue and Burnell Road, and the relief surface water sewer in Morden Way have been completed. Both of these schemes have been constructed to overcome flpoding which had been experienced at intervals. In the latter part of the year work commenced on the construction of the Cuddington Way soil relief sewer, and this will be completed by the Spring of 1962. Rivers and Streams. The streams within the Borough have been maintained in a satisfactory condition. Refuse Collection and Cleansing. The scheme which commenced in 1960 for the haulage of refuse from the areas of both Mitcham and Sutton and Cheam Councils to the controlled tip at Buckland has proceeded throughout the year. Closet Accommodation There is only one cesspool in use in the Borough, and one septic tank. Since 1928, one hundred and sixty two premises, originally with cesspool drainage, have been connected to sewers Only two pail closets and three chemical closets are in use, not including those in temporary use on new building sites. 12 SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA Report of the Chief Public Health Inspector under Regulation 25 (20) of the Public Health Officers Regulations, 1959.

(B) 25 - 43 (odd) Maiden Road, Cheam These properties were acquired as a 'Clearance Area' by the Council in 1959. They were still in occupation at the end of the year, except for Nos, 27 and 37 which had been vacated. New houses and flats are in course of construction by the Council on land at the rear of Pond Hill Parade and Nos. 25 to 43 Maiden Road. It is anticipated that the new buildings will be completed in 1962 and the occupants rehoused. 5- Housing Act, 1957 - Sections 16 and 17 (A) 16 to 26 (even) Benhill Avenue, Sutton Upon representation the Housing Committee decided in July, 1961 to accept an undertaking from the landlord not to relet these properties as they became vacant. (B) 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15 Park Road, Cheam The Ministry of Housing and Local Government had placed these cottages on the supplementary list (Grade 3) of buildings in the Borough whilst not regarded as possessing a sufficient degree of architectural or historic interest to merit inclusion in the statutory list, were regarded as possessing sufficient interest to justify their being borne in mind. The Surrey County Council has since decided not to make a Building Preservation Order in respect of the properties. Undertakings were accepted from the landlord in 1960 not to relet the houses when they became vacant. At the year end two of the cottages were empty. (C) 5, 7 and 9 Maiden Road, Cheam These cottages had also been placed by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government on the supplementary list (Grade 3), but it was decided later that a Building Preservation Order should not be made, The Borough Council had already accepted undertakings from the landlord not to relet as the. houses became vacant, and have now granted permission for the redevelopment of the area for the erection of houses and garages subject to certain conditions. 16 6. Housing Act, 1957 - Section 157 (A) 125, 127, 129, 131 and 131a, Cheam Common Road and Nos. 1,3,5 and 7 Woodbine Lane, Worcester Park The acquisition for housing purposes of the freehold interest in these properties has recently been completed and No. 7 Woodbine Lane acquired, subject to a leasehold interest expiring in October, 1964. As the housing development will necessitate the demolition of part of these leasehold premises the District Valuer is in negotiation for the acquisition of the leasehold interest. (B) 5, 7, 9 and 11 Wilcox Road, Sutton The Borough Council agreed in January, 1961 that this property be purchased in connection with the comprehensive redevelopment of the area in which they are situated and alternative accommodation to be offered to the occupants as and when available, and further that the site after purchase be used as a temporary public car park until required for redevelopment. 7 Housing Act, 1957 - Part IV Overcrowding (a) (1) Numbe r of dwellings overcrowded at the year-end. 56 (2) Number of families dwelling therein 122 (3) Number of persons dwelling therein (i.e. Equivalent number of adults) 322½ (b) Number of new cases of overcrowding reported during the year 35 (c) (1) Number of cases of overcrowding relieved 34 (2) Number of persons concerned in such cases (i.e. Equivalent number of adults) 119 (d) Particulars of any case in which dwelling houses had again become overcrowded after the local authority had taken steps for the abatement of overcrowding Nil These figures are based on the known cases of statutory overcrowding, and are obtained from cases discovered during routine inspections of dwellings, applications made for Council housing accommodation, and on information received in the Department, all of which have been checked by your Inspectorial Staff at the year-end. During the year 283 visits were made to dwelling-houses in respect of overcrowding enquiries and permitted number of occupants. 17 The 34 cases of overcrowding abated were relieved by the following means (a) Rehoused by the Borough Council 17 (b) Reduction in the number of occupants 5 (c) Other accommodation obtained on own initiative 11 (d) Rehoused by other Local Authorities 1 8 Grants for the Improvement or Conversion of Houses Section 20 of the Housing Act, 1949 empowered local authorities to make grants, at their discretion, for the improvement of dwellings by the provision of such amenities as a bath, hot water system, water closet, food storage facilities, etc. and for the conversion of houses into flats. The Borough Council decided to operate the scheme in October, 1954- The House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959 which came into force in May, 1959, added a new kind of grant (Standard Grant) to which an owner is entitled as of right provided certain preliminary conditions are complied with. The following is a summary of applications for grants received and dealt with by the Borough Council up to 31st December, 1961, as supplied by the Town Clerk:- Applications Received Discretionary Conversions Standard Total From inception of the scheme to 31st December, 1961 184 30 72 286 During 1961 24 2 20 46 Withdrawn, ineligible or not granted From inception 29 15 11 55 During 1961 6 0 3 9 Approved From inception 151 15 56 222 During 1961 16 2 15 33 Outstanding at 31st December, 1961 6 0 3 9 Total grants paid to 31st December, 1961, £28,892. 2s. 5d Grants paid during 1961 total £7,279. 12s. 9d. made up as follows.- Discretionary £4,256. 5s. 6d.

Standard £1,423. 7s. 3d. 18 RENT ACT, 1957 This Act came into operation on the 6th July, 1957 and applies primarily to privately owned property let unfurnished as separate dwellings, but it also affects furnished lettings. The main effect of the Act was to free from rent control houses and flats with rateable values exceeding £40 in the Metropolitan Police District, and the City of London, or over £30 elsewhere in England and Wales, and to allow limited increases in the rents of houses and flats still under rent control. The Act has the general objective of enabling rented properties to be put in repair, of increasing the total stock of rented accommodation, and of securing a better use of existing housing accommodation The following summary shews the number of applications received for 'Certificates of Disrepair', and for the cancellation thereof during the period 6th July, 1957 to 31st December, 1961. (A) Applications for Certificates of Disrepair From 6.7.1957 to end of 1961 1961 only Number of applications received 140 4 Number of decisions not to issue certificates - - Number of applications withdrawn 9 1 Number of decisions to issue certificates 131 3 (a) in respect of some, but not all defects 104 2 (b) in respect of all defects 27 1 Number of undertakings given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule (Form K) 75 2 Numher of undertakings refused by Local Authority under proviso to paragraph 5 of the First Schedule 1 - Number of certificates of disrepair issued (one application withdrawn after service of Form J) 56 1 (B) Applications for Cancellation of Certificates Number of applications received 32 5 Number of objections to cancellation received 6 - Number of certificates cancelled 27 5 Number of objections to cancellation upheld . 5 - Number cancelled in spite of tenant's objection 1 - PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1936 - WORKPLACES Inspections Number of written and verbal notices Occupiers prosecuted 45 2 - 19 CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 Smoke Abatement and Atmospheric Pollution There are but few industrial chimneys in the Borough. 8 complaints of smoke emission were received and dealt with during the year, 5 of these were in respect of bonfires, one in respect of an incinerator, and two from boiler stacks attached to hospital premises. Grit Deposit Measuring Gauges In conjunction and with the co-operation of the Department of Scientific & Industrial Research, the grit deposit measuring gauges have been maintained and samples collected monthly for analytical examination. The Borough is adequately covered by three grit deposit gauges which are sited roughly 1 Vi miles apart. The following is a summary of the results obtained during the year:- MONTH Gauge No. 2 Gauge No. 6 Gauge No. 7 Rainfall in inches Total Solids (Tons per sq.mile) Rainfall in inches Total Solids (Tons per sq.mile) Rainfall in inches Total Solids (Tons per sq.mile) January 2.59 9.48 2.90 8.57 0.82 7.79 February 2.36 10.38 *see below *see below 2.22 7.06 March 0.17 6.39 0.15 4.52 0.19 4.97 April 1.81 10.44 2.21 8.46 1.93 9.38 May 1.18 6.99 1.26 7.48 1.10 7.29 June 1.34 10.44 1.34 7.11 1.34 6.03 July 1.50 8.58 1.42 6.03 1.50 5.17 August 2.05 8.92 2.05 7.81 2.36 7 03 September 1.97 8.65 2.40 6.36 1.97 5.21 October 2 68 9.25 3.03 7.48 2.56 7.22 November 2.52 11.60 2.56 10.58 2.36 8.26 December 2.68 11.63 2.84 10.34 2.64 8.42 Yearly Totals 22.85 112.75 22.16 84.74 20.99 83.83 Monthly Average 1961 1.90 9.39 2.01 7.70 1.75 6.98 1960 2.59 10.62 2.79 10.77 2.44 8.97 *Gauge found to have been tampered with, therefore contents not submitted for analysis. The above table shows a definite reduction in the monthly average figure for total solids deposited (tons per square mile) during 1961 as compared with 1960 Some of the factors which appear to contribute to the reduction include (a) the ever increasing number of electrical, gas and oil fired appliances installed in domestic., commercial and industrial premises (b) the building of blocks of flats etc with controlled central heating appliances in areas of the Borough previously occupied by the larger type of residential dwelling and (c) the growing tendency for more of the selected smokeless fuels to be used in domestic grates. DAILY MEAN CONCENTRATION OF SMOKE AND SULPHUR DIOXIDE A daily record has been kept since the 1st November, 1958 of the amount of smoke or suspended matter and sulphur dioxide in the air by means of a smoke filter and volumetric sulphur dioxide apparatus installed in Manor Park House. It has long been recognised that a distinction must be drawn between relatively coarse particles of solid matter which are quickly deposited by their own weight, and which comprise most of the particulate matter collected in the deposit gauge and the very fine particles which settle slowly, if at all, These fine particles, commonly referred to as 'smoke', are less than about 20 microns (0.002 cm) in size and consist largely of carbonaceous matter, including tar, produced by the incomplete combustion of coal; some fine ash is also included. It is important to realise that little of this fine material is collected in the deposit gauge which in consequence gives no information about pollution by smoke. To obtain such information a smoke filter is necessary The following table gives a summary of the daily readings taken during the year 1961.

The replacement of the ordinary constituents of boiled sweets by dextrose monohydrate would tend to result in a lower calorific value and not a higher one, thus the claim for extra food value could not be accepted Cautioned The manufacturers were informed of the infringement, and arrangements made for new labels to be printed omitting any claim for extra food value of these confections. 3069 (Informal) Garlic Oil Labelling Infringement 'Garlic Oil' was found not to be a satisfactory description of this article as it contained only a very low proportion of garlic oil, and was, essentially maize all flavoured with garlic oil Cautioned The American Shippers were informed of the infringement, and they agreed to rectify the matter by having all future shipments of this article correctly labelled. 3025 (Informal) Ice Lolly Syrup (Pineapple Flavour) Labelling Infringement The ingredients of this article were not specified on the label contrary to the La belling of Food Order, 1953. Cautioned After taking up the matter with the Manufacturers amended labels were received and the new wording approved., 2981 & 2982 (Informal) Milk These samples taken from a local hospital were found to contain 3.5% and 3.51% milk fat and only 8,35% and 8.45% milk solids other than milk fat respectively. The minimum standard being 3% milk fat and 8.5% milk solids other than milk fat, under the Sale of Milk Regulations, 1939 However, the freezing point (Hortvet) test did not indicate the presence of added water. Cautioned Formal samples were immediately taken in course of delivery at the Hospital and found to be satisfactory The Dairy Company concerned were informed of the deficiency and they stated that such a deficiency was very common at that time of the year (March), but steps were being taken to rectify the position. 25 Sample No Article Sampled Type of Infringement Action taken and Remarks 1219 (Formal) Warm Milk On analysis this sample which had been taken at a local cafe was found to contain 15% added water Cautioned The matter was reported to the Public Health Committee, but owing to a time lapse legal proceedings could not be taken A warning letter was sent to the cafe proprietor 3003 (Informal) 1 Mixed Vegetables in wine vinegar Labelling Infringement This article contained ingredients which although specified correctly on the label, were not in the correct order Cautioned The importers were informed of the Infringement, and through their co-operation the Italian Manufacturers agreed to reprint the labels shewing the main ingredients in their correct order as requested 2999 (Informal) Whole Orange Drink Labelling Infringement The label on the container described, this article as "Whole orange drink made with whole oranges", but contained only 15% w/v of orange fruit Cautioned Upon informing the manufacturers of the misleading label they agreed to discontinue the use of the word 'whole' in the direct description of this drink on future labels 3060 (Informal) Whole Orange Drink Labelling Infringement This article contained only about 10% of potable fruit, although labelled "Whole Orange drink Dilute to taste Made from whole fresh oranges &c" Cautioned The Manufacturers on being informed of the infringement took immediate steps to have new labels printed describing the article as ''Orange Drink" 26 Sampling Observations It will be seen from the detailed classification that of two hundred and sixteen samples taken during the year 1.4% were found to be other than genuine and labelling infringements accounted for a further 2 ,77% making a total of 4.17% For comparative purposes the figures for 1960 were 0.91% and 2.74% respectively, making a total of 3.65%. The pattern of sampling has followed that of previous years in that a wide range of commodities has been covered. A satisfying result has emerged since the infringements revealed were generally of a minor character and with the willing co-operation of retailers, importers and/or manufacturers were usually readily adjusted. Public Analyst's Comments, 1961 One is struck these days by the amazing variety of foods coming on to the market, foods which at one time might have been sold by very high class stores in London's West End or, for Continental Delicacies, in Soho, but which now find their wqy into quite ordinary suburban shops and supermarkets. Foreign foods of a specialist character come from West Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, The Netherlands and from U.S.A. I have no doubt this is a tendency which will increase as time goes on, especially if we have the European Common Market, but I find that British Manufacturers are not slow to accept the challenge and are themselves introducing new varieties of foodstuffs often with ingeniously devised new names designed to tickle the fancy, the palate and the pocket of the purchaser. Who is this purchaser? Is it the traditional British Housewife catering for her family, or the hostess looking for something to delight her guests, or is it the single man or woman living in a small flat and experimenting with food as part of life's experience? No doubt market research has already given the answer, but I have not read of it. Very little additional legislation affecting, the work of the Public Analyst has been passed during 1961 There are now official limits for lead in food (coming into force in April, 1962) but limits of a similar order have been operated unofficially for so many years by Public Analysts that the new Regulations only serve to codify an existing practice. They are useful, however, in deciding in a few instances, between the somewhat high tolerances asked for by manufacturers or packers of a few special foods and the lower limits which it would appear to the analyst are capable of being reached by care in selection and processing. In one or two cases a limit is set in the Regulations for immediate adoption with a lower limit after an interval. One or two comments on the samples submitted by the Chief Public Health Inspector during 1961 are called for. One of them serves to illustrate the amazing sales value attributed to the word 'glucose'. A sample of boiled sweets described as Extra Glucose Confections was claimed to give "greatly increased food value", yet the only difference between this article and an ordinary boiled sweet was the inclusion in the formula of 10 per cent of glucose powder in the usual mixture of sugar and corn syrup. Since sugar and corn syrup are reduced with the greatest of ease on digestion to simple sugars having the same energy value as glucose there was no foundation for this claim 27 It is perhaps possible that in certain cases of illness the use of glucose instead of sugar is clinically desirable and where large quantities of soluble carbohydrates in the form of sugar might be cloying, but claims which suggest that glucose has some miraculous virtue not possessed by other forms of sugar are nonsense Amongst the samples which were reported as adulterated are two described as Whole Orange Drink This is a most unfortunate term which has arisen because such drinks are prepared from comminuted oranges What is not made clear, however, is that they often contain only 10 to 15 per cent of fruit and that a further five -fold dilution before consumption reduces the actual fruit content of the drank to 2 or 3 per cent. It is to be hoped that a future revision of the Soft Drinks Order will make it compulsory to specify the fruit content on the label of such articles Finally, a word or two as to the dangers of pesticides residues in foods. These could arise from the spraying of agricultural crops with one or more of the numerous pesticides now available to farmers and some of these are highly toxic to man In practice na danger is likely to arise if the rules for use recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are followed and, in particular, if the right concentration of pesticide is used and sufficient time is allowed to elapse between spraying and marketing From my own experience and that of other Public Analysts there is no evidence of any hazard to health, but this is something which, as in the case of the older insecticides and fungicides containing compound of lead, arsenic and copper requires constant vigilance on the part of Food and Drugs Authorities The samples submitted during 1961 included fresh mushrooms, tomatoes and apples which-were examined specifically for any toxic residues. None were detected MILK SUPPLY Food and Drugs Act, 1955 The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960 The Borough of Sutton and Cheam is a specified area for the purpose of the Milk (Special Designations) (Specified Areas) Order 1951, therefore all milk sold in the Borough is designated milk The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960 came into force on the 1st January, 1961 in respect to dealers' licences. These regulations consolidated and re enacted with amendments the Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations 1949 to 1954, and the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations 1949 to 1953 Theprincipal changes are:- (a) Dealers' licences (except for a few kinds granted by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) are granted by the food and drugs authority for the area within which are situated the premises at or from which the milk is pasteurised, sterilised, or sold, as the case may be dealers' licences permit sales outside as well as inside the area of the licensing authority, and supplementary licences are now discontinued 28 (b) A dealer's (pre-packed milk) licence has been introduced which permits the sale of all three kinds of specially designated milk, where the milk is obtained by the dealer in the container in which it is to be supplied to the consumer, or is pasteurised or sterilised by the dealer, (c) The period for which a dealer's licence will be granted has now been extended from one year to five years, All milk distributors in the Borough are licensed to use the special designation in relation to the milk retailed. Routine inspections of the milk pasteuriser's and distributors' premises reveal that the provisions of the regulations are generally well observed. The following licences authorising the use of special designations were issued during the year and expire on the,31st December, 1965:- Dealer's pre-packed Tuberculin Tested, Pasteurised and Sterilised 27 Tuberculin Tested, and Pasteurised 1 Tuberculin Tested 1 Pasteurised and Sterilised 2 Postearised 3 Sterilised 11 Dealer's Tuberculin Tested 1 Dealer's Pasteuriser's 1 Total 47 BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF MILK SAMPLES One hundred and fourteen samples of milk were examined as follows Class of Milk Number of samples examined Type of Test applied Passed Results Failed Void Pasteurised 71 Phosphatase 71 - - Methylene Blue 62 - 9 Sterilised 7 Turbidity 7 - - Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) 12 Phosphatase 12 - - Methylene Blue 9 - 3 Tuberculin Tested (Farm Bottled) 24 Methylene Blue 13 7 4 TOTALS 114 91 7 16 To comply with the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations 1960, samples of 'Pasteurised' and 'Tuberculin Tested' Milk on arrival at the testing laboratory shall at once be removed from the insulated container and stored as follows.- 29 (a) A sample taken at any time during the period from 1st May to 31st October inclusive, shall be kept at atmospheric shade temperature until 9.30 a.m on the following day (b) A sample taken at any time during the period from 1st November to 30th April, inclusive, shall be kept in its original container, or in a sterile 3 oz sample bottle at atmospheric shade temperature until 5.0 p.m on the day of sampling and thereafter at a constant temperature of 65°F+ 2°F until 9.30 a.m. on the following day The Methylene Blue test shall be begun between 9.30 a.m, and 10.0 a.m. on the day after the sample is taken, but the test shall not be applied if during the period of storage at atmospheric shade temperature this temperature at any time exceeds 70°F The test shall be deemed to be satisfied by milk which fails to decolourise methylene blue in thirty minutes. Seven samples of Tuberculin Tested (Farm Bottled) Milk failed the test. The dairy companies concerned were notified immediately of the failures in order that the matter could be taken up with the responsible producers as speedily as possible. The sixteen void samples of 'Pasteurised' and 'Tuberculin Tested' Milk were not subjected to the Methylene Blue Test because the atmospheric shade temperature had exceeded 70°F during the required storage period as mentioned above. The 'Phosphatase' test for Pasteurised Milk shall be deemed to be satisfied by milk which gives a reading of 10 ug or less of p-nitrophenol/ml of milk. Eighty-three samples were subjected to this test and found to be satisfactory. CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF MILK AND CREAM SAMPLES MILK Forty-two formal and twenty-nine informal samples of milk were taken for chemical analysis; all but three were found to be genuine Seventeen samples of 'Channel Island' milk contained satisfactory averpges of 4.39% milk fat and 8.95% milk soli4s other than milk fat; and fifty-four other samples pf milk contained satisfactory averages of 3 64% milk fat and 8.67% milk solids other than milk fat. The results were well above the minimum standard of 4% milk fat laid down in the Milk and Dairies (Channel Islands and South Devon Milk) Regulations 1956, and of 3% milk fat and 8.5% milk solids other than milk fat required under The Sale of Milk Regulations 1939. 30 CREAM Analysis of five informal samples of cream showed three double cream samples to contain an average of 49.26% milk fat and two single cream samples a satisfactory average of 21.4% milk fat The minimum standards in relation to cream are as follows:'double cream' not less than 48% by weight of milk fat; and 'other creams' described as single cream, pouring cream, coffee cream, fruit cream, or as any other description of cream - not less than 18% by weight of milk fat. ICE CREAM Food and Drugs Act, 1955 Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations, 1959 Food Standards (Ice Cream) Regulations, 1959 Registrations During the year sixteen applications for the registration of premises for the sale and storage of ice cream were received and granted. At the end of 1961 a total of one hundred and seventy-five premises had been registered for the sale of ice cream in accordance with Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, and on two of these premises ice cream could be manufactured, BACTERIOLOGICAL SAMPLING OF ICE CREAM During the year sixty-nine samples of ice cream were obtained for bacteriological examination and provisional grading. The following table shows the 1961 percentage results in each grade and for comparative purposes the results obtained in 1960.

The regulations prescribe amended standards for ice cream and for "Parev" (kosher) ice and introduce separate standards for dairy ice cream (or dairy cream ice or cream ice) and for milk ice The standards for dairy ice cream and for milk ice provide that they shall contain no fat other than milk fat except such as may be introduced by the use of any egg, any flavouring substance or any emulsifying or stabilising agent. The requirement in the 1953 Order that ice cream should contain not less than 10% of sugar is replaced by a provision that no type of ice cream shall contain any artificial sweetener. Alternative standards are prescribed for certain descriptions of ice cream containing fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree. The standard of composition for ice cream is as follows (a) Ice cream shall contain not less than 5% fat and 7/4% milk solids other than fat. (b) Ice cream containing any fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree shall either conform to (a) above or, alternatively the total content of fat and milk solids other than fat shall be not less than 12lA% of the whole including the fruit etc. and such total content of fat and milk solids other than fat shall include not legs than 7½% fat and 2% milk solids other than fat (c) Dairy Ice Cream, Dairy Cream Ice, or Cream Ice shall in each case contain not less than 5% milk fat and no other fat (except as mentioned in second paragraph above), and not less than 7½% milk solids other than fat. (d) Milk Ice or Milk Ice containing fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree shall contain not less than 2½%$ milk fat and no other fat (save as mentioned in second paragraph above), and not less than 7% milk solids other than fat 12 samples of locally produced ice cream were submitted to chemical examination during the year and found to contain constituent percentages above the prescribed standard, as under 32 Constituent Percentages Sample No Fat Milk Solids other than fat 2967 5.5 9.8 3005 12.2 15.0 3006 5.2 8.0 3022 11.5 12.5 3039 5.2 8.6 3053 5.3 9.6 3054 8.1 13.0 3066 5.2 10.0 3068 13.1 12.5 3095 5.7 9.2 3098 13.5 13.1 3108 10.4 13.7 Average 8 4 11.25 ICE LOLLIES BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION There is no prescribed standard for water ices or ice lollies sold as such, but as in former years ice lolly samples have been submitted to a test similar to the one applied to ice cream. Thirty-six lollies were examined and found to be satisfactory. FOOD & DRUGS ACT, 1955 FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, I960 These regulations which came into operation on the 1st October, 1960, amend and consolidate the Food Hygiene Regulations 1955 to 1957. A number of amendments have been embodied in the general provisions of the Regulations in the light of the experience gained since they first came into operation. The most important of these amendments are described below;- (a) The term "catering business" has been introduced into regulations 25(2) (temperature at which certain foods are to be kept) and 28(1) (supply of water to stalls), in order to indicate more clearly the type of business to which these requirements apply. (b) The definition of "meat" has been extended to include rabbits, game and poultry. (c) The scope of the expression "handling of food" is widened so that the obligation of food handlers will in future extend to persons who wash up or clean food equipntent (d) Herbal smoking mixture and snuff are now included with tobacco, which a person engaged in the handling of food shall refrain from using whilst he is handling open food or is in any food room in which there is open food. 33 (e) Regulation 26 as amended makes it clear that food transport and delivery vehicles have to be kept clean and in good condition, and suitably and sufficiently lighted when being cleaned. A proviso has been added to permit the driving compartment of a stall or vehicle to be used as a sleeping place if it is effectively separated from the food compartment. The following is a summary of the number of food premises in the Boroughr- Bakehouses 12 Butchers (including one horseflesh shop) 58 Confectioners (sugar and flour) 180 Fishmongers/Stalls/Fried Fish Shops 28 General Stores/Shops 12 Greengrocers/Stalls/Stores 87 Grocers 132 Ice Cream (Manufacture and sale of) 182 Licensed Public Houses 33 Milk Purveyors/Depots/Dairies 41 Restaurants/Cafes/Snack Bars/Dining Rooms 62 School and Industrial Canteens/Kitchens/ Service Rooms 45 Other Food Premises 15 TOTAL 887 During the year 1510 visits were made to food business premises, 58 notices were served in connection with the 83 infringements discovered as detailed in the following table;- Food Hygiene Regulations Number of Infringements found tin 1961 Number of Infringements rectified in 1961, (including infringements discovered in 1960, but rectified in 1961) Regulation No, 5 _ 1 " 6 2 4 " 8 4 3 " 9 10 8 " 10 _ _ " 12 _ _ " 14 16 29 " 15 _ 6 " 16 12 14 " 17 1 3 " 18 3 2 " 19 2 2 " 20 1 1 " 21 _ _ " 23 28 34 " 24 _ _ " 25 1 _ " 26 3 3 " 28 _ _ ,, 29/30 _ _ TOTAL 83 110 It is gratifying to record that the majority of the traders continue to show a willing co-operation to comply with the requirements of the Regulations. Mention must also be made that the standard of hygiene in the various food premises and the cleanliness of the persons engaged in the handling of food is much improved, but constant vigilance is necessary. 34 Prosecutions (a) Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955 to 1960 No proceedings were taken during the year under these Regulations. (b) Food and Drugs Act, 1955 Proceedings were taken under Section 2 of the Act for selling to the prejudice of the purchaser food not of the substance demanded as follows (a) Selling a bottle of milk containing a horse-chestnut - Case dismissed. (b) Selling a 'Steak and Kidney' pie in a mouldy condition Fine £10 with £5. 5s. 0d. costs. In addition two cases were pending at the year end - (a) Selling five unwrapped 'Hovis' loaves affected by>bird droppings, and (b) Selling mixed salad containing a piece of glass. Complaints Regarding Food Unfit for Human Consumption The following is a summary of various complaints received and investigated during the year. The general circumstances of these cases did not warrant legal proceedings being taken, but each case was considered on its merits and appropriate action taken where necessary. Barley sugar sweets - contained head of wasp Beef (English) Abnormal odour and taste in meat.

Slaughter of Animals Act, 1958 One licence to act as a slaughterman was granted in 1961 to the R.S.P.C.A. Inspector. Bakehouses There are twelve bakehouses in the Borough, with one exception, all are provided with mechanical power. The standard of cleanliness and sanitary conditions in the majority of cases were found to be satisfactory as revealed by the visits of inspection made during the year. Shops Act 470 visits were made to various premises under the Shops Act and revealed that the arrangements made for the health and comfort of the shop workers are in the majority of cases satisfactory. Schools The sanitary conditions and the water supply to the Schools in the area were found to be generally satisfactory. Hairdressers' and Barbers' Premises There are seventy establishments in the Borough. 65 inspections were made during the year. The premises generally were found to conform to the requirements of the Hairdressers and Barbers Bye-laws 1947. Merchandise Marks Act One hundred and fifty-eight visits were made to food premises under this Act. The infringements discovered wer(e principally in connection with the marking of imported apples, tomatoes and dead poultry. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 The intention of the Act is to secure the use of clean filling material in upholstered articles, and other articles which are stuffed or lined. The Act provides for the registration of certain premises by the Local Authority on payment of a registration fee and the licensing of certain other premises on payment of a statutory fee. 37 No applications to store rag flock were received during the year. Pet Animals Act, 1951 This Act came into operation on 1st April, 1952 and provides that no person shall keep a pet shop except under the authority of a licence granted by the Local Authority in accordance with the provisions of the Act and on payment of a fee not exceeding ten shillings. 13 visits of inspection were made during the year. Seven licence renewal applications were received and granted during 1961. Licensed Places of Public Entertainment There are seventeen licensed places of public entertainment in the Borough. They are used mainly for cinematograph shows, concerts, dancing and social functions. The general standard of cleanliness was found to be well maintained. Licensed Public Houses 21 visits of inspection were made to the 33 licensed public houses in the Borough As a result of inspections under the Food Hygiene Regulations a considerable number of improvements have been carried out at many public houses. These include the provision of additional or improved sanitary conveniences, washbasins, hot water supply, improved ventilation to kitchens, bars and cellars, and the more general use of detergents and sterilising agents for the washing of utensils, beer pipe lines and pumps. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952 Eight visits were made to premises from which heating appliances are sold. This involved the carrying out of numerous tests on the many types and designs of heaters offered for sale. No infringements of the Act were discovered. This Act was repealed in August 1961 by The Consumer Protection Act, 1961. Noise Abatement Act, I960 Under Section 1 of this Act which came into operation on the 27th November, 1960 noise or vibration which would amount to a nuisance at common law becomes a statutory nuisance which can be dealt with according to the procedure provided in Part III of the Public Health Act, 1936- 38 Local Authorities will under this procedure be able to require the abatement of a noise or vibration nuisance by the service of an abatement notice on the person causing the nuisance or on the owner or occupier of premises on which it arises and if the notice is not complied with it can be enforced by proceedings in a magistrates court. Apart from action by a local authority, three or more occupiers of land or premises who are aggrieved by a noise or vibration nuisance may make a complaint to a magistrate. Section 2 of the Act deals with the use of loudspeakers in streets. It prohibits their use for any purpose between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m. (except in special circumstances) and at any other time for advertising any trade, business or entertainment with the exception that between noon and 7 p.m. a loudspeaker fixed to a vehicle used for the sale of perishable foodstuffs may be operated to announce that the commodities are for sale. The loudspeaker is, however, not to be so operated as to give reasonable cause for annoyance to persons in the vicinity. Four complaints of noise were investigated and abated during the year. Disinfection and Disinfestation Council Houses Private Houses Other Premises Number of houses treated with insecticide for bugs and fleas 1 21 - Nineteen school canteen kitchens and ten hospital kitchens were sprayed for flies, ants and moths. The insecticides used were Pybuthrin, D.D.T. Residual and Municipal Spray, Gammexane Liquid Spray, Zaldecide M. Powder and Fumex Fumigators. RODENT CONTROL The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 A. Surface Treatments (1) 6071 visits were made during the year by the Rodent Operator and 851 by the Public Health Inspectors to premises infested or possibly harbouring rats or mice. 576 premises were cleared of rats or mice and no major infestations were recorded. (2) The work for the year is generally summarised as under:- Complaints received or cases discovered and investigated589 Number of premises found to be infested 568 Number of premises where no evidence of rodents found 21 Number of premises cleared of rats or mice (including 82 previous year's cases) 576 Number of premises still being treated at the year end 74 39 (3) The cause or site of infestation at the 568 infested premises was:- Keeping of poultry 7 Inside premises (under floors etc.) - rats 30 Inside premises (under floors etc.) - mice 56 Buries, scrapes etc.,in gardens, land etc 319 Under or inside sheds 154 Defective drains 2 Total 568 (4) Type of premises found to be infested:- With Rats With Mice Total Council Property 10 1 11 Dwellinghouses 448 25 473 Business Premises, etc. 23 25 48 Schools, Hospitals, Canteens etc. 6 19 25 Land 11 - 11 Total 498 70 568 (5) Summary of the type of premises and methods employed in clearing premises of rats and mice:- Type of Premises Cleared Dwellinghouses (mainly in gardens) 482 Food shops and food premises 26 Non-food shops 6 Waste land and building sites 12 Hospitals and Schools 18 Factories and Workplaces 10 Council Premises (other than dwellings) 12 Miscellaneous 10 Total 576 Methods employed in clearing 576 premises of rats and mice.

Anticoagulant poison - Warfarin 0.5% Master Mix was used with pinhead oatmeal, technical white oil, castor sugar, and para-nitrophenol (mould inhibitor) as a bait base. 40 Rebaiting of all infested manholes continued until no bait takes were recorded The following is a summary of the results obtained:- Number of Sections A B C D E Total Manholes baited - 1st visit 17 - 40 113 30 200 Complete takes - 2nd visit - - - 1 1 2 Partial takes 2nd visit 1 - 1 15 4 21 Complete takes - 3rd visit - - - - 1 1 Partial takes - 3rd visit - - 1 11 4 16 Complete takes - 4th visit - - - - - - Partial takes - 4th visit - - - - 4 4 Takes - 5th visit - - - - - Nil (2) Test Baiting (1961-62) The Borough was divided into five sections, as in previous tests, and a test baiting of 10% of the soil sewer manholes carried out from the 18th to 25th September, 1961. All the manholes baited were checked three days after the baits had been deposited, with the following results:- Number of Sections A B C D E Total Manholes baited 30 53 32 41 39 195 Complete takes 7 1 2 6 5 21 Partial takes 2 1 3 4 - 10 Baits not taken 21 49 27 29 33 159 Baits washed off - 2 - 2 1 5 (3) Treatment No. 29 - First Maintenance Treatment (1961-62) This treatment was confined to the sections known to have been infested during the previous maintenance treatment (No.28) together with those sections proved to be infested by the annual 10% test baiting, and operations were completed on the 6th November, 1961. Warfarin 0.5% Master Mix was again used, as this poison is harmless to the operators using it and a more positive result is anticipated by the complete eradication of rats in the sewers treated. Rebaiting and examination of the infested manholes continued until no bait takes were recorded. The following is a tabulated summary of the results achieved:- 41 Number of Sections Total A B C D E Manholes baited - 1st visit 78 54 20 71 25 248 Complete takes - 2nd " 3 - - 2 8 13 Partial takes - 2nd " 6 - 3 25 7 41 Complete takes - 3rd " 1 - - - 1 2 Partial takes - 3rd " 1 - 2 9 3 15 Complete takes - 4th " - - - - - - Partial takes - 4th " - - 1 2 - 3 Takes - 5th " - - - - Nil (U) Key to Sections Section A Sutton All roads south of the Sutton Station and east of Brighton Road.

Section D Cheam All roads between London Road and Stonecot Hill and west of the Wimbledon, St. Helier Branch Line. Section E Worcester Park 42 INCIDENCE OF AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS DISEASES One thousand, two hundred and sixty eight cases of notifiable diseases, other than Tuberculosis, were notified during 1961, compared with three hundred and sixty seven cases in 1960 and one thousand, seven hundred and thirty eight in 1959 Scarlet Fever Forty nine cases were notified in 1961 as against one hundred and sixty six in 1960 The incidence was highest in the first and second quarters of the year, there being seventeen cases in the first quarter, nineteen in the second quarter, seven in the third quarter and six in the fourth quarter The illness was generally mild and there were no deaths. The present less exacting control of Scarlet Fever, with its lesser interference with school attendance of cases and contacts, is probably justified whilst the illness remains so mild, although hindering prevention of spread Diphtheria No case was notified during the year. The last case in Sutton and Cheam occurred in 1951 Diphtheria Anatoxin The possibility of Diphtheria must always be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of infections of the throat. The early injection of antitoxin is the only effective treatment of Diphtheria. Swabs for diagnosis should be taken before any antibiotic is administered. Any suspected cases should be admitted to isolation hospital at once for diagnosis and treatment. Diphtheria Immunisation. Diphtheria Immunisation is still very necessary. Immunisation is safe, simple and effective. Every child should be immunised before the age of twelve months (and if triple antigen is used - and this is desirable - immunisation should be started as early as the third month), with reinforcing doses at appropriate intervals thereafter Immunisation is free of charge and can be arranged through the family doctor or at Child Welfare Clinics. During 1961, one thousand one hundred and seventy six children received a primary course of immunisation as follows - Children Born in. Years 1961 1960 1959 1958 1957 1952 1947 Total 1956 1951 Number Immunised 465 455 51 33 39 113 20 1176 In addition, one thousand eight hundred and eighty seven children received reinforcing injections. 13 Measles One thousand one hundred and forty eight cases were notified in 1961, compared with forty eight cases in 1960 There was no death Nine hundred and thirty of the cases were notified during the first quarter of the year. The monthly incidence of notified cases is shown in the following table January 68 July 11 February 506 August 1 March 356 September 2 April 125 October 2 May 40 November 4 June 31 December 2 Measles cases must be kept out of school for ten days after the appearance of the rash and may then return if the child is sufficiently well to do so. Contacts are not excluded except the under fives, who should be excluded for fourteen days from the date of appearance of the rash in the last case in the home. However, all contacts should be carefully scrutinised daily before being allowed to go to school, and should be excluded if suffering from a cough, cold, chill or redeyes. No child who is known for certain to have had the disease need be excluded. The illness can be prevented or modified by the injection of gamma globulin early in the incubation period. A small quantity is available to doctors for cases of special risk. Health visitors are informed of notified cases of children under five years of age so that they may give advice where necessary. Whooping Cough. Thirty four cases were notified in 1961, compared with eighty three cases in 1960. .There was no death. Three fifths of the cases were notified in the first half of the year. The monthly incidence of notified cases is shown in the following table:- January 2 July 5 February 3 August - March 7 September - April - October 4 May 4 November 2 J une 5 December 2 44 Whooping Cough is a serious infection in early infancy. The danger of mortality is highest in the first three months of life and diminishes with age. Every effort should be made to protect babies and weakly infants from contact with infection The vaccines give substantial protection Immunisation should commence not later than three months of age. Cases are excluded from school for twenty eight days from the beginning of the characteristic cough. Child contacts under seven years of age should be excluded for twenty one days from the date of onset of a case in their home if they have not had the disease Health Visitors are informed of notified cases of children under five years of age so that they may give advice where necessary. Immunisation against Whooping Cough. Immunisation against Whooping Cough is available free of charge for children under five years of age, either through the family doctor or at Child Welfare Clinics. In 1961, one thousand and fifty seven children received immunising injections. Three injections are given at monthly intervals. The injections are given either separately or combined with immunisation against Diphtheria, or preferably Diphtheria and Tetanus In addition, six hundred and seven children were given reinforcing injections during the year. Smallpox No case was notified. Vaccination against Smallpox The speed of travel has increased the risk of Smallpox being imported. Our protection depends on vaccination. There is no drug which.will cure the illness, although one is under trial Vaccination is safest in infancy and provides a basal immunity which can be reinforced later with reduced reaction Vaccination is voluntary and as regards infants and school children is free of charge and can be arranged through the family doctor or at the nearest Child Welfare Centre. Immunity should be reinforced by re-vaccination between the age of five and ten years and again about school leaving age. During the year, six hundred and sixty seven babies under the age of one year were vaccinated. The percentage of 61.0 compares with 45 1 in 1960 and 65.5 in 1959 The following table shows the number of vaccinations during 1961 r- Age Number Vaccinated Number Re-Vaccinated Under 1 667 - 1 74 - 2-4 36 9 5 - 14 43 41 Over 15 61 267 Totals 881 317 45 Puerperal Pyrexia Six cases were notified in 1961, compared with eight in 1960 No case occurred at home. Puerperal Pyrexia is "any febrile condition occurring in a woman, in whom a temperature of 100.4° Fahrenheit (38° Centigrade) or more has occurred within fourteen days after childbirth or miscarriage" Tetanus A scheme for the immunisation of children against Tetanus on request by parents is in operation The Tetanus bacillus is present in horse manure and in manured land. Infection enters the body through contaminated wounds and abrasions which may be so slight as to escape notice. The object of immunisation is to prepare the tissues in advance to resist the Tetanus bacillus Children are prone to abrasions and should be protected from the incidental risk of infection. At present it is a routine to inject anti-tetanic serum after wounds. This serum occasionally causes undesirable allergic reactions and its use can be avoided by precautionary immunisation with toxoid before injury. Immunisation against Tetanus can be given separately, or, in children, preferably combined with immunisation against Diphtheria and Whooping Cough, and must be sustained by reinforcing injections at appropriate intervals. A record of the dates of injection should always be carried on the person During 1961, one thousand one hundred and fifty three children received primary injections, and six hundred and forty nine children received reinforcing injections It is also very desirable that all who work in agriculture or in stables should be immunised. Food Poisoning Two cases were notified in 1961, compared with four cases in 1960. The cases were in one family and were caused by Staphylococcus Aureus infection in a home cooked ham which was stared for an excessive period under ideal conditions for the growth of germs. A third member of the family did not eat the ham and so escaped illness. The low incidence of infections due to Salmonellae and Staphylococci in food is satisfactory. Prevention of infection depends on scrupulous cleanliness in the production, storage, manufacture and distribution of food. The washing of hands after use of the W.C. is the most effective protective measure against intestinal carriers of infection. Early notification of cases of food poisoning is necessary so as to obtain the residue of suspected food for bacteriological examination. No food handler should ever be allowed to return to work without bacteriological clearance. Dysentery There were two cases of Dysentery in 1961, compared with forty seven cases in I960. Both were of the Sonne type, and both in women. One developed symptoms after admission to hospital for another condition, and the other worked in Kingston and had midday meals out. No source was found in either case. 46 Sonne Dysentery is a highly infectious form of gastro-enteritis. The infection is spread by faecal contamination of hands, objects, and in Particular, lavatory seats Prevention depends on the washing of hands after use of the W.C. and on the efficient cleansing of communal W.C.'s. in schools and public places. It is most desirable that all cases of diarrhoea should be checked bacteriologically. Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fevers. One case of Paratyphoid B. (Beccles Type) occurred in a woman of sixty six, who worked part time as a kitchen helper, and in a bar. Despite extensive checking of contacts, no other case or carrier was discovered. She was in hospital for seven weeks but made a good recovery. Meningococcal Infection. No case was notified. Poliomyelitis. The year 1961 was the third successive year the Borough has been free from this infection. In England and Wales in 1961 the number of cases of Poliomyelitis and deaths therefrom were about double the figures for 1960, but less than those for 1959. Towards the end of the year supplies of Salk Poliomyelitis Vaccine were in shorter supply and the introduction of oral vaccine early in the coming year seems likely. During the year approximately two thousand three hundred and ninety nine persons were vaccinated against Poliomyelitis in the following groups:- (1) Persons born 1943 - 1961 1241 (2) Persons bom 1933 - 1942 242 (3) Persons born 1921 - 1932 732 (4) Other priority groups 184 In addition, two thousand three hundred and twenty four persons received third injections. Fourth injections for children of primary school age were introduced during the year, and five thousand, four hundred and seventeen children received these injections. Acute Encephalitis. There were no cases in 1961. Pneumonia. There were forty four deaths from Pneumonia in 1961, compared with forty five in 1960. Twenty three cases of Pneumonia were notified in 1961, compared with nine in 1960. Ten were cases of Influenzal Pneumonia. Non-Notifiable Diseases. School teachers reported one hundred and thirty eight cases of Mumps, two hundred and forty eight cases of Chicken Pox and ninety nine cases of German Measles. School returns are a useful index of the prevalence of non-notifiable diseases and are a basis for consultation with the school medical officer. Infestations. One case, an elderly lady, was given one treatment for infestation by head lice before being readmitted to hospital. 47 International Certificates of Vaccination.

The death rate was 0.013 per thousand of population, as against 0.025 in 1960. There was no death from Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis, the same as in 1960 For England and Wales the death rate for Pulmonary Tuberculosis was 0.06 per thousand of population and for Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis 0.01 per thousand of population. The number of new cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis was twenty nine, compared with nineteen in 1960 and forty one in 1959. Residual foci of infection still persist, particularly among the middle aged and elderly, and intensive search will be necessary to eliminate the disease. The use of B.C.G. vaccine in adolescent children gives a high measure of protection. Five hundred and seventy eight children received injections in 1961, and twenty seven children were found to be Mantoux positive. The response rate in the thirteen year age group was 71.4 per cent. One new case of Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis was notified in 1961, compared with six in 1960. The Sutton and Cheam Tuberculosis and Chest Care Committee continued its valuable assistance to patients suffering from Tuberculosis and other chronic chest conditions and to their families throughout the year. Additional nourishment, clothing, bedding and fuel were provided where necessary. Grants were made to provide occupational therapy, and holidays were arranged for children, mothers, and convalescent patients. The Chairman is Mrs. F. Smyth, J.P., and the Hon. Secretary is County Alderman Mrs. Margaret Walken, O.B.E., J.P., 9, All Saints Road, Sutton.

General Public 1092 1601 2693 Industrial Groups 384 497 881 TOTAL 1476 2098 3574 Pulmonary Tuberculosis: Cases requiring treatment or close clinic supervision 4 - 4 Lung Cancer 1 1 2 The incidence of active Pulmonary Tuberculosis was 1.1 per thousand persons examined. The findings are an index of infection in a sample of the population. Although this Survey shows the value of Mass Radiography in securing the diagnosis and treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, it also shows that Mass Miniature Radiography is increasingly important in finding cases of Lung Cancer in the general population. 52 APPENDIX ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN RESPECT OF THE TEAR 1961 FOR THE BOROUGH.
