Flushing and Cleansing has been carried out as before, and t le Sewers, both covered and open, are in a fair state of cleanliness. Complaints of stoppage, flooding, and other defects have been promptly examined, and remedied as far as possible, where the duty of doing so has been with the Vestry. 1 he House Drainage has been somewhat more than last year, from the circumstance of several new sewers having been constructed. The applications for house drainage are for 756 houses, upon which about £1340 has been paid into the office. The estimated cost of private work done by the applicants is £L 1,000, which has been executed under the inspection and general supervision of the officers of the Vestry. New Buildings.—The Vestry have received notices for building 39G new houses, the drainage of which, and the level of the lowest floors in relation to the sewers have been considered and approved as directed by the Act. Twenty-eight applications, made to the Metropolitan Board of Works, for leave to bring out and alter frontages, have been referred to the Vestry, and reported upon by them. The approval of the Metropolitan Board has been given for the formation of thirteen new streets. The construction of the Main Low Level Sewer by the Metropolitan Board of Works has provided the means of draining a large district of this Parish, hitherto unprovided for, and the opportunity has been taken at the earliest moment by the Yestrv as the foregoing particulars show, in which, the Camberwell New Road, South Lambeth and Wandsworth Road, and adjacent streets arc mentioned as the places where works are about to be done. SANITARY MATTERS. In the year 1864 the births exceeded the deaths by more than one-third. There were 6,439 births registered: of which 1,720 were in the first quarter; 1,554 in the second quarter; 1,553 in the third quarter; and 1,612 in the last quarter of the year. The number of deaths registered during the year were 4,245 : viz., in the first quarter, 1,336 ; in the second quarter, 961; in the third quarter, 912 ; and in the last quarter, 1036. Table II. shows the births and deaths during each quarter of the year, in each of the eight Ecclesiastical Divisions of the Parish. In the Waterloo Road, 1st part district, there were 607 births and 343 deaths during the year; in the Waterloo Road, 2nd part, 893 births and 484 deaths; in the Lambeth Church, 1st part, 764 births and 556 deaths; in the Lambeth Church, 2nd part, 1,265 births and 1,051 deaths, — 334 of which occurred in the Workhouse; in the Kennington, first part district, 1,274 births and 767 deaths; in the Kennington, 2nd part, 627 births and 478 deaths; in the Brixton district, 697 births and 401 deaths; and in the Norwood, 312 births and 162 deaths—17 of which occurred in the Children's Workhouse. lable ill exhibits the different periods of life in which the deaths took place. lhus, 1,934 deaths were under the age 7 of 5 years; 290 between 5 and 20 years; 484 between 20 and 40 years; 613 between 40 and 60 years; 755 between 60 and 80 years; and 169 at 80 years and upwards. 1 he healthiness of the Parish may be ascertained by examining Table IV, which gives the death-rate of the entire 1 arish, and of cach of its sub-divisions, obtained from a comparison of the number of deaths with the estimated population, contrasted with the whole of the Metropolis and the South District, from which it will be seen that the general death-rate (although higher than in previous years) continues to bear a favourable comparison with the entire Metropolis, as well as with the South District, of which Lambeth forms a part. In six out of the eight divisions of the Parish, the death rate was higher than in 1863; in two, lower, viz., the Waterloo lioad, 1st part, and the Brixton District. The four most healthy Districts were the Norwood ; Brixton; Waterloo road, 1st part; and the Kennington, 2nd part, districts. The four least healthy, the, Lambeth Church, 1st and 2nd parts; the Waterloo Koad, 2nd part; and the Kenninjfton, 1st part, districts. 1 He average number of inmates of the Adult Workhouse was 889, and the deaths, 334; excluding the Workhouse, the death-rate of the Lambeth Church, 2nd pari, district would become 243*9 instead of 346.6 per 10,000. The average number of inmates of the Children's Workhouse was 371, and the deaths, 17; excluding the Children's Workhouse; the death-rate of the Norwood district would be 169 7, instead of 181.7 per 10,000 of the population. > Table V. shows the deaths from Epidemic diseases, which amounted to 939, being in the proportion of rather over 22 per cent, of the deaths from all causes. In the previous 8 year they formed nearly 23½ per cent, of the entire mortality. Scarlatina, Diarrhoea, Diptheria, Whooping Cough, and Small Pox were less fatal than in 1863, whilst the deaths from Typhus and Measles were more numerous. The Sanitary Improvements effected between the 25th March, 1864, and the 25th March, 1865, are shown in Table I, and have been regularly brought under the notice of the General Purposes Committee, in the fortnightly Reports of the Medical Officer. From this Table it will be seen that 2760 cases of Nuisances have received attention and been remedied, or removed, to effect which, in most cases, several visits from the Inspectors were necessary; (>84 notices were served, and 19 Summonses required to be taken out; 519 houses in a dirty state, or rendered unwholesome in consequence of Fever, have been cleansed ; 489 houses with bad drainage, drained ; £08 cesspools where drainage was not available, emptied; 127 drain obstructions, removed ; 388 accumulations of dung, garbage, dust, &c., removed; 57 offensive smells from trades, &c., abated; 11 foul urinals cleansed ; 37 lots of pigs, removed or nuisance therefrom abated ; 97 yards paved; 132 new ashpits constructed ; 159 houses supplied with water. SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. These have continued under inspection, and cleanliness enforced. Licenses were granted for 121 ; in two instances the places being unfit for the purpose, licenses were opposed on the recommendation of the Medical Officer, and refused by the Magistrates. 0 COW-HOUSES. These were all visited in the Autumn by the Medical Officer, and great improvements effected in many of them, by the removal of Lofts, thereby increasing the breathing space, and improving the means of ventilation; licenses were granted for 100; three in bad condition were opposed at the Quarter Sessions, on the recommendation of the Medical Officer, and the Magistrates refused to grant the licenses. BAKE-HOUSES. There arc 203 bake-houses in the Parish, and it having been represented that the Provisions of " The Bake-house Regulation Act," (26th Sc 27th Vic. cap. 40) were evaded, and that boys under the age of 18 years were employed in bake-houses at night, between the hours of 9 p.m. and 5 a m.; the Medical Oilicer of Health, accompanied by the Inspector of Nuisances visited during the night a number of bakehouses where night work was carried on, and at two places found boys at work. The masters were summoned, and fines were inflicted in each case. TABLE L PARISH OF ST. MARY, LAMBETH.

Cardigan Street.— New Aberdeen edge-kerb laid to foot-ways throughout the street; road-ways made up and gravelled, and foot-ways gravelled. Larkhall Lane.— New Granite kerb and 2½-inch York paving in front of shops near Jeffries' Road. Stockwell Green.—From Romsey Road, new 3-inch York paving. Brixton Hill.—From Brixton Church to Parish boundary, new 3-inch York paving, 6 feet in width, to foot-way, on one side. Effra Road.—From Brixton Road to George Channing Public House, new 3-inch York paving and Granite kerb to foot-way, on one side. Harleyford Street.—New 3-inch York paving to footway, on one side, from Clapham Road to the Oval. Stamford Street.—From Parish Boundary to Duke Street, carriage-way paved with 9*3 Aberdeen pitching on 12-inch Concrete; foot-ways on both sides relaid and made good with new 3-inch York and 12*8 inch Aberdeen kerb. 17 South Lambeth Road—From Vauxhall Cross to Clapham Road, new 3-inch York paving to foot-way, on one side. Thornton Street, Brixton Road.—Foot-ways kerbed with new 12*6 Granite flat kerb, paved their whole width with new 2½-inch York; roadway formed, made up with core and gravel. Camberwell New Road.—New 3-inch York paving to foot-way, upon one side of the road, so far as the Parish extends, from Brixton Road to Camberwell Green. Harleyford Road.—From Oval to Upper Kennington Lane, new 3-inch York paving to foot-way, on one side. willcox Road.—Foot-ways kerbed with new 12*6-inch Granite kerb, and paved with 2½-inch York; the road-way properly formed, made up with core, and gravelled. Of the foregoing works, those in Thornton Street and Willcox Road have been executed under the compulsory powers of the Metropolis Management Act, and the cost of the works have been charged upon the Owners, and paid to the Vestry. Proceedings under these powers have also been taken in respect to— £ Meadow Road, at an estimated cost of 460 Chancellor and Buccleugh Roads 420 Saint George's Place 354 Hamilton Road 2,332 Mawbey Estate 2,900 Burton Road 860 Lambeth Mews 345 Jeffries' Road 987 Hanover Square 449 Vaughan Road, and other streets, Cold Harbour Lane 1,590 Stockwell Crescent, Clapham Road 70 These proceedings are in various stages: in Hamilton Road, Chancellor Road, and Mawbey Estate, the money has been paid and the works are about to be commenced. The exercise of these powers, by the Vestry, are found to work B 18 beneficially in newly-formed neighbourhoods; and will, for the future, prevent the creation of uncared for and neglected streets, which have hitherto been a growing discredit to the Parish. Repairs and improvements have been made in Water Lane, Norwood Lane, Cornwall Road, Vauxhall Cross, China Walk, Waterloo Road, and Lower Marsh. The amount paid into the Office, for paving works to be done at the cost of individuals, during the year, is £2728 12s. 2d; by Gas and Water Companies, for the repair of roads and foot-ways. £434 6s. 10d. LIGHTING During the past year, 48 applications have been received, for increase of lighting in various parts of the parish. The Lighting has been improved by the erection of 38 additional Lamps, and the removal of 19 other3 to more eligible situations. The total number of Public Lamps now lighted by the Vestry are 2,325; the cost, including the removal of Lamps, new Columns, &c., for the year ending the 25th March, 1865, amounts to £10,318 16s. 8d.; being less than the preceding year, by £40 17s. 11d, although the number of Lights has been increased by 38; this is owing to a further reduction allowed by the South Metropolitan Gas Company. The Photometer in the Vestry Offices has proved of great service to the Chemical Examiner, in his experiments on the illuminating power, purity, and pressure of gas supplied to the Parish; these experiments have been carried on with great regularity, and a monthly report has been made, showing very satisfactory results.
