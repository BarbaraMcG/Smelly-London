Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Health of the Borough for 1960. This report has been compiled in the following five chapters, three with a statistical appendix, in which the figures relating to the functions of the Public Health Department have been collected together according to the relevant services. Chapter I VITAL STATISTICS, Page 6, Statistical Appendix A, Pages 7—13. II GENERAL HEALTH SERVICES, Pages 14—17. „ III INFECTIOUS DISEASES, Page 18, Statistical Appendix B, Pages 19—24. „ IV ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE, FOOD AND WATER, HOUSING, FACTORIES, ETC., Pages 25—35, Statistical Appendix C, Pages 36—51. V ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPARTMENT AND STAFF, Pages 52—53. 5 CHAPTER I. VITAL STATISTICS 1. The population of the Borough in mid-1960 was estimated by the Registrar-General to be 126,120 and whilst this is considerably below 131,384 the census figure for 1951 it probably represents the most accurate figure attainable. The census of April, 1961, will reveal a more accurate figure but this must await the report of next year. 2. In 1960 there were recorded 1,652 live births, giving a crude birth rate of 13.1 per thousand estimated population. The RegistrarGeneral has provided boroughs with a comparability factor for this calculation which takes into account the relative proportion of women of child bearing age in the total community. When this factor of 1.01 is applied the standardised birth rate becomes 13.2, a more realistic figure, the origin of which, however, must be remembered when comparing it with past years. 3. The infantile mortality rate of 13.3 compares very favourably with the national rate of 21.7 per thousand and this is often used as a pointer to the adequacy of the services provided. This figure would have seemed quite unattainable a few years ago and indicates the advances in obstetrics and paediatrics which have become available in the district in recent years. 4. The number of deaths totalled 1,125, giving a crude death rate of 8.01 per thousand. The comparability factor when applied produces a standardised death rate of 9.21, again well below the national rate. 6 STATISTICAL APPENDIX A.

GENERAL HEALTH SERVICES. 1. HOSPITALS. The whole of Wembley lies within the area of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board but hospitals accepting the sick are administered by two Hospital Management Committees, the Central Middlesex Group Hospital Management Committee and the Hendon Group Hospital Management Committee, the two major general hospitals being the Central Middlesex Hospital and the Edgware General Hospital. The Wembley Hospital is administered by the Mount Vernon Group, and the Kingsbury Maternity Hospital under the control of the Governors of Charing Cross. Infectious diseases are normally accepted at the Neasden Hospital or, in case of necessity, at the West Hendon Hospital. Cases of mental deficiency and mental disease are catered for at Shenley Hospital. Arrangements are made for the admission of tuberculous patients to a variety of hospitals through the three Chest Clinics serving the area. A list of hospitals is included:— Central Middlesex Hospital, Acton Lane, N.W.10. (ELGar 5733.) Edgware General Hospital, Edgware, Middlesex. (EDGware 2381.) Wembley Hospital, Fairview Avenue, Wembley, Middlesex. (WEMbley 3136.) Kingsbury Maternity Hospital, Honeypot Lane, Kingsbury, N.W.9. (COLindale 6309.) Neasden Hospital, Brentfield Road, Neasden, N.W.10. (WILlesden 2251.) West Hendon Hospital, Goldsmith Avenue, Hendon, N.W.9.

Edgware Chest Clinic, Edgware General Hospital, Edgware, Middlesex. (EDGware 3406.) The provision of a new hospital at Northwick Park is still under discussion between the Ministry and the Regional Hospital Board. 2. AMBULANCE SERVICE. A service of ambulances and sitting case cars is maintained by the Middlesex County Council as Local Health Authority at:— No. 4 Depot. (WORdsworth 7721) The accident service is obtained by dialling 999. The authority of a medical practitioner is required for service to be given, except in emergency and accident cases. 3. HEALTH SERVICES. Health Services under Part III of the National Health Service Act, 1946, are provided by the County Council and relevant details in so far as they apply to the Borough are included below:— County Medical Officer : A.

The response of the mothers to the advice given through the School Health Services is most gratifying. 5. MORTUARY. The Mortuary, situated at the rear of the Town Hall, accepted 173 bodies during the year. The Attendant appointed offers reciprocal arrangements with Harrow to cover absences due to holidays, sickness, etc. 17 CHAPTER III. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. FOOD POISONING. Despite the great amount of scientific and bacteriological investigation which has taken place in recent years, and the practical application of the conclusions reached, there is very little reduction in the incidence of Food Poisoning. The education of kitchen workers now appears to be the field where the greatest chance of improvement lies. Many of the kitchen premises where outbreaks have occurred have been almost ideal in construction and equipment, whilst the lapse has often been one of temporary relaxation in the normally high standard maintained by the staff. The total of cases notified during the year was 18, but none of these was from outbreaks. It is certain that many sporadic cases occur which arc not notified but equally probable that all major incidents are discovered and investigated. 2. INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATES OF IMMUNISATION. The Department continues to authenticate the International Certificates of Vaccination for travellers who have received inoculations from Wembley practitioners. During the year 916 certificates received attention in the Department. 18 Winter Respiratory Diseases (October—March). Notifications of primary pneumonia and acute influenzal-pnjumonia.

A dual obligation is imposed upon any person who installs a new furnace in industrial premises or a new furnace of an output greater than 55,000 British Thermal Units per hour in domestic premises, (a) to install only such a furnace which is, so far as practicable, capable of being operated continuously without emitting smoke when burning fuel of the type for which it was designed, and (b) to notify the local authority of his intention to install the furnace. During the year the Health Department became aware, by notification or otherwise, of the installation of furnaces, which appear to meet the requirements of the section, in existing buildings as follows:— Factories 8 Houses 39 Commercial premises 3 Section 10. When the deposited plans for the erection or extension of a building other than a dwelling, shop or office, include the provision of a chimney, the local authority must be satisfied that the height of the chimney will be sufficient to disperse adequately any smoke, grit, dust or gases emitted from it. In general, the most significant emissions are likely to be grit and dust from solid fuel furnaces (including incinerators), and sulphur dioxide from the combustion of fuel oil. For a new chimney serving an oil-fired furnace the Health Department recommends that its weight should be such as to disperse the flue gases sufficiently to result in an increase of the ground level concentration of SO2 by no more than 25 p.p.h.m. During the year the number of new chimneys at industrial buildings erected in accordance with this recommendation numbered eight. 25 Section 11. That the control exercised over new heating installations is not onerous and that Smoke Control Orders are merely accelerating a national trend towards the use of smokeless fuel is well shown by the facts produced during the house to house survey of Wembley No. 1 (Barn Hill) Smoke Control Area, for out of 1,403 buildings which will be subject to the first Order 799 are already using smokeless fuels. In later years 1960 may well be regarded as a memorable one in connection with the prevention of atmospheric pollution, for it marks, with the making of the first Smoke Control Order, the initiation of a programme which should, in time, produce notable benefits to the health of the community, comparable with, if not so spectacular as the introduction of piped water supplies and water carriage systems of sewerage.

At their meeting on the 3rd March, 1958, the Health Committee recommended "that the Borough Council agree in principle to the Barn Hill area being declared a Smoke Control Area." This recommendation was adopted by the Council on the 18th March, 1958, and by October, 1958, a pilot survey of the area had been completed and details were submitted to and approved by the Council. As a result of the 10% survey it was estimated that the total cost of adaptations to be carried out in the area would be £4,439 and that the actual cost to the Council would be £1,332 plus administration costs. The detailed survey of the area was carried out during the year and the following information has been collated. During the survey over 2,000 visits were made to premises in the area, two occupiers refused to supply information, four houses were vacant and thirty dwellings were found to be owned by the Crown. There are no premises which need to be specifically exempted on account of the type of fireplace or furnace installed in the premises. 26 Area— 298.8 acres. Premises: Dwellings 1,377 Privately owned 1,231 Council owned 116 Crown owned 30 Commercial 20 Industrial 2 Others 4 Estimated Cost of Replacement or Adaptation: No. of fireplaces to be replaced 651 Estimated cost of new appliances £2,559 Estimated cost of installation £1,687 No. of fireplaces to be adapted 1 Estimated cost of adaptation £1 No. of gas or electric points to be provided 375 Estimated cost of provision of gas and electric points £1,835 Total estimated cost of the whole area £6,082 Council refund 70% £4,258 Council claim 4/7ths of this from the Exchequer £2,433 Cost to the Council £1,825 Tonnage of bituminous coal to be replaced with solid smokeless fuel for open fires 732 p.a. Equivalent in coke 586 p.a. 27 Building Byelaw 115A, made under the Clean Air Act, 1956— Section 24. The heating of new buildings may be effected by either, (a) furnaces installed after notification to the local authority, and otherwise complying with Section 3 of the Clean Air Act, 1956, or (b) appliances, of the following classes, being those which arc exempted in Smoke Control Areas, (i) any "fireplace" specially designed or adapted for the combustion of liquid fuel, (ii) any "fireplace" equipped with a mechanical stoker, (iii) the Solid Fuel Ductair Unit, (iv) the Fulgora Slow Combustion Stove (designed to burn woodwaste), or, (c) appliances for heating or cooking which are suitably designed for burning gas, electricity, coke, or anthracite. Appliances in the last category should either be amongst those included in the Gas Council's List of Tested and Approved Domestic Gas Appliances, the List of Recommended Domestic Electrical Appliances compiled by the Electrical Development Association, or the List of Approved Domestic Solid Fuel Appliances prepared by the Coal Utilisation Council and the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation. Alternatively, stool-bottom grates for use with solid smokeless fuel should comply with British Standard 1251-1945 (amended 1949) which makes recommendations as to firebacks, fuel capacities, ash pits and ash pans, and what is of critical importance, as to the air space between firebars, the means of air control, and the provision for gas ignition. New buildings, erected during the year, in which the heating and cooking arrangements were fitted in accordance with this byelaw under the supervision of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department were as follows:— Privately built dwellings 171 Council built dwellings 24 2. THE PETROLEUM REGULATION ACTS. From the 1st January, 1960, all premises requiring to be licensed for the storage 28 of petroleum or petroleum mixtures, have had to meet conditions of greater stringency than were applied previously. As has been the practice for many years, all new underground tanks continue to be subjected to an air pressure test of ten pounds per square inch, held for twenty-four hours, before being brought into use. The additional requirement now is that existing tanks must be subjected to a test for soundness in their twentieth, twenty-fifth and thirtieth year and every second year thereafter. At the end of 1959 there were 125 underground tanks of a total capacity of 101,000 gallons which had been installed for twenty years or longer and all were tested under the supervision of the Public Health Inspectors prior to recommending the renewal of licences. A further five tanks of 5,000 gallons which were installed in 1940 were similarly tested during the year. It is encouraging to report that only one tank (which had been out of use but was hoped to be brought back into use) was found to be defective. Its proposed re-use was not allowed. Eight new tanks of a total capacity ot 15,000 gallons were installed in accordance with the Council's requirements and under the supervision of the Public Health Inspectors during 1960. Ten years ago the Home Office put forward recommendations designed to guard against danger to petroleum storage installations from the electrical equipment of pumps, and since that time all new pumps set up in Wembley have been required to comply with these recommendations. Electrically operated pumps over ten years old and already existing in premises for which a renewal of licence was sought from the 1st January, 1960, were required to be brought up to the standard of electrical equipment formerly applicable to new pumps only. This involved the checking of 57 old pumps by the Public Health Inspectors during 1959 resulting in 41 being renewed, rewired or otherwise adapted to bring them to a condition in which their licensing could properly be recommended. Number of premises licensed to store petroleum spirit or mixtures 150 Aggregate amount of petroleum spirit or mixtures licensed to be stored 323,550 galls. (Carbide of Calcium 20½ tons.) Number of visits of inspection made to premises 373 29 3. SLUM CLEARANCE. The Health Committee, in 1955, accepted a list prepared by the Medical Officer of Health under Section 1 of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, detailing some 43 properties requiring the attention of the Council, and resolved to deal with these properties under the live-year plan. Of the 43 houses originally included, 21 have been demolished, 10 were allowed to remain standing on an undertaking received from the owners to make the houses in all respects fit, 3 houses were vacated and the owner gave to the Council an undertaking not to re-let; 9 houses therefore remained at the end of the period under review; 6 of these premises are in the ownership of the County Council who will not re-let once the premises have become vacated; the 3 remaining houses have received certain structural attention during the period and remain to be finally dealt with. Overcrowding. The number of cases of overcrowding known to rhe Health Department has shown a steady decrease as the following figures indicate. Year. Number of Cases of overcrowding on Register. Total Number of Cases of overcrowding relieved during the year.

Nuisance Orders were obtained against the owners of two fiats, in respect of leaking roofs, requiring the work to be carried out within twenty-eight days. The owners were fined £5 0s. 0d. and the Council were awarded 3 guineas costs in each case. A hawker was fined £2 0s. 0d. with one guinea costs, for selling food from a vehicle not registered under Section 11 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950. In respect of offences under food legislation, legal proceedings were taken on four occasions. The manufacturers of a jar of Piccalilli containing a piece of glass were fined, and a dairy company was fined for selling milk in a dirty bottle. Two firms of bakers were prosecuted for selling loaves of bread, one containing a wood-louse and the second contaminated by grease. 5. INFORMATION BOOKLET. Details of the community services and the social services provided locally, both by statutory and voluntary authorities, were collected and compiled into a booklet which was duplicated in the Department and distributed to those individuals and organisations within the area who may have need of the information. The booklet must have been found of value as it was most cordially accepted and we received in the Department numerous letters of congratulation and expressions of thanks for copies. 6. WATER SUPPLY. The piped water supply of the Borough is accepted largely from the mains of the Colne Valley Water Company and has remained satisfactory both in quantity and quality. A very small part of the southern end of the Borough is supplied by the Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Company and this supply also has been of satisfactory quality and adequate quantity. In the Colne Valley area, occasionally, at the summit of various hills, a lack of pressure has been noted. It has been very rare for the supply to fail, but complaints have from time to time been received that the supply cisterns have failed to replenish in residences situated near the summit of Barn Hill, and similarly at times supply cisterns have become depleted where they are situated in the roof space of lofty flats on the slopes of the hill. This defect in supply has been for a matter of some hour or two during peak demand and has never occasioned more than inconvenience. 31 On very rare occasions complaints have been received of a sandy deposit in water collected from the taps of domestic premises. On investigation the Water Company have maintained that this originated from a sedimentary deposit in the pipes which is flushed away at times when great demand is made. It is harmless, and, whilst being aesthetically unacceptable, is none the less incapable of causing any injury. Bacteriological examinations of the water taken from delivery points in the Borough, both by the Colne Valley Water Company and by the Department, have invariably proved the supply to be of excellent quality. Little can be done to change the chemical quality of the water, which is satisfactory for a potable supply, but, for information, a typical analysis is included. Chemical Results in parts/million. Appearance Bright Colour (mm.) 0 Odour Normal Reaction pH 7.40 Total Solids dried at 180°C. 332 Chlorine in Chlorides 37.0 Nitrogen in Nitrates 4.5 Nitrogen in Nitrites Absent Hardness — Total 210 Permanent 88 Temporary 122 Metals — Lead Absent Zinc Absent Copper Absent Iron 0.03 Free Ammonia Absent Albuminoid Ammonia 0.036 Oxygen absorbed in 3 hrs. at 37°C. 0.35 Fluoride (F) Less than 0.1 In the last report comment was made on the success achieved by the Colne Valley Water Co. in reducing, over the years, the hardness of water supplied to the Borough. I have included in this year's report a table showing the mean hardness figure for the past two years. 32 Year January February March April May June July August September October November December 1959 212 186 194 187 202 163 165 183 170 164 153 156 1960 174 178 196 204 195 189 171 179 166 182 219 218 7. PUBLIC SWIMMING BATHS. Two open-air public swimming baths are provided in the area and serve the general public during the summer period, usually from May to September. The Vale Farm Pool is 55 yards long and 25 yards wide with a maximum depth of 9 feet and has a capacity of 400,000 gallons of water which is obtained from the Colne Valley water supply. The Pool is constructed of mass concrete and lined with glazed bricks. The water is filtered through Candy Pressure Filters and has a complete change every 4½ hours, the circulation being effected by 20 h.p. pump with a stand-by 15 h.p. pump. "Breakpoint" chlorination is effected and an average consumption of approximately 3 lbs. per hour of chlorine. The water is then neutralised by the addition of soda which gives an approximate pH factor of 7.5 which indicates slight alkalinity. The bathing load is approximately 1,500 and the basket room system of changing is in operation with cubicles surrounding the Pool. A Cafe is provided for refreshments and the catering let out to a Caterer on an annual basis. The Kingsbury Pool is situated in Roe Green Park in the Kingsbury Road and has a length of 55 yards and a width of 25 yards with a maximum depth of 10 feet. The capacity is 464,000 gallons but in this case there is a foot trough surrounding the Pool and also a Children's paddling pool. The water is supplied by the Colne Valley Water Company and is circulated through Permutit Pressure Filters and pumped by means of two 15 h.p. pumps and a complete change of water is effected every five hours. Chlorination is again on the "breakpoint" system and the same dosage and neutralisation arrangements. The Pool at Kingsbury is constructed of reinforced concrete and again is lined with glazed bricks. The capacity of this Pool for bathing is approximately 2,000, but there is a greater spectator area here than at Vale Farm. The basket room system is again in operation but in this case the changing accommodation 33 cubicles are under the terraced seating. A Cafe is also provided at this Pool and catering is carried out by outside Caterers. Samples of the water taken from the Pools and subjected to bacteriological examination, revealed the absence of B. Coli in all samples and proved the quality of the water to be beyond reproach. 8. SEWERAGE. The growth of the population in Wembley and the increase in domestic and other premises, was very considerable during the years 1930/1960, and the intervention of a period when few works could be undertaken on account of wartime conditions resulted in the Borough being behind-hand in the provision of adequate drainage, both for the surface water and for soil sewage. The Council were very conscious of this difficulty and an extensive programme of sewerage construction received their approval. During the year 1960 various relief and replacement and new schemes of drainage were undertaken involving a capital sum of £260,000. Details of the schemes are included and, at the completion of these, adequate drainage can be said to be provided throughout the Borough. Name. Type. Estimated Expenditure. Remarks. 1. North Kingsbury Scheme. Soil and Surface Water. £177,200 Commenced November, 1959. Estimated completion, June, 1961. 2. Shaftesbury Avenue to Wealdstone Brook.

The Rodent Control Service which is confined to dealing with infestations by rats and mice has continued to operate during the year under review. A staff of three "Ministry trained" assistants has performed the necessary work. No charge is made to householders in respect of treatment at private dwelling houses but in all other cases a charge is made on a time and materials basis. 792 premises were satisfactorily treated by the Council and 3 premises were known to have been treated privately. 10. PUBLIC CLEANSING. The Director of Public Cleansing has kindly supplied the following information:— Refuse Collection. House and Trade refuse is collected weekly, with the exception that refuse from certain blocks of flats is collected twice weekly. The amount of refuse collected during the year was 30,230 tons. The separate collection of waste paper from business premises free of charge has been maintained. The amount collected from this source during the year was 797 tons. Refuse Disposal. Refuse is disposed of by a Separation and Incineration Plant which has handled 31,653 tons. Salvage materials amounting to 3,565 tons were sold for £20,534. Street Cleansing. The system of street sweeping by the use of pedestrian controlled electric trucks, each with an operator and four street orderlies, continues to give a frequency of sweeping of at least once every seven days. Public Conveniences. The increase in use of the free washing facilities at the two staffed Conveniences in the Borough has been maintained during the year. 35 STATISTICAL APPENDIX C.

During the year your Medical Officers acted professionally for the Council in performing 49 clinical examinations of actual or prospective staff and have provided a number of special reports to the various Committees of the Council. This helps in securing a medically sound personnel for all the activities of the Council and enables special consideration to be given to any unusual incidence of sickness, thereby maintaining a standard of efficiency difficult without such a service. The establishment of the environmental hygiene section of the Public Health Department has remained static for a considerable number of years, but concurrent with the operation of the Clean Air Act, it was found necessary to increase the Inspectorate by one and to augment the Clerical staffing of the Department. A scheme of training for Public Health Inspectors suggested by the Royal Society for the Promotion of Health was approved by the Ministry, and ultimately recommended to local authorities by their associations. The Council at its meeting in June, 1960, authorised increase in the establishment of the Health Department by one Student Public Health Inspector, as from April, 1961. This sponsored pupillage will be of value to the Borough in securing the services of a keen, if inexperienced, young man who wishes ultimately to become a Public Health Inspector, and will be of value to the Department during the final years of his pupillage. The Council also may derive some satisfaction from knowing that they are helping to remedy the national shortage of Health Inspectors. A panel of members of the Administration Committee undertook a general review of establishment during the year, and recommendations were made in relation to the Public Health Department. For convenience a table is included which shows the establishment before these changes occurred and the recommended establishment at the end of the year under review. 52 Establishment. Previously.

An unusually heavy burden of work was imposed on the Inspectorate and the Clerical Officers of the Department and it affords me considerable satisfaction to express my gratitude for the conscientious, loyal and cheerful way in which every member of the staff has responded to this situation. In conclusion, I would express my thanks and appreciation to all members of the Council, especially those who serve on the Health Committee, and particularly the Chairman, for the admirable way in which they have directed the policy of the Department during the year. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen. Your obedient servant, E. GRUNDY, Medical Officer of Health. 53 Hart don Printing Works Limited 66, East Road, Burnt Oak Edgware, Middlesex Telephone: EDG. 6181
