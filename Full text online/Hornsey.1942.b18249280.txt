Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year ending December 151st. 1942. The chief vital statistics are set out in Table A, where it will be seen that the birth-rate at 16.37 per thousand of population is the highest since the rise which occurred immediately after the last war. The infant mortality rate of 49 8 is a great improvement on the figure of 63.2 for 1941, but is still far above the pre-war figure of 27.25. The general death-rate at 14.13 is considerably higher than that for England and Wales (11.6), and is largely explained by deaths of verv young infants and very aged men and Women. Infantile Mortality. Deaths of children under one year of age numbered 61, which is at the rate of 49.8 per 1,000 live births. More than half (33 out of 61) occurred in the first week of life. Tuberculosis. The deaths from all forms of tuberculosis numbered 60 in 1942. as compared with 49 and 48 in 1940 and 1941 respectively. This war-time rise has come later in Hornsey than in most other towns. Infectious Diseases. The most notable fact in the vital statistics of 1942 is the absence of any death at any age from any of the following infectious diseases: —Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, cerebro-spinal fever, scarlet fever, whooping-cough, diphtheria, measles, poliomyelitis and encephalitis. The causes of this unique absence of mortality in diseases which in the past have, at one time or another, taken serious toll of life, are various—e.g., good sanitation has practically eliminated the typhoid-paratyphoid group ot fevers; modern chemo-theraphv (the discovery of the sulphonamide group of drugs) has revolutionised the treatment of cerebro spinal fever and other infective processes; immunisation has reduced diphtheria to a very low incidence and practically eliminated the risk of death; in the remaining acute specific infectious diseases, like measles and whooping-cough no more definite explanation of the absence of any fatal cases can be offered than a generally higher standard of health and consequent increased resistance to these diseases and their complications. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor. Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obediant servant, R. P. GARROW. Medical Officer of Health. 6 STATISTICS FOR 1942. (Section A). SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STATISTICS.
