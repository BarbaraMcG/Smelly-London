ISL 29 REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OP SAINT MARY, ISLINGTON. FOR JANUARY, 1860. No. XXXIV. The general mortality of Islington, as registered during the month of January, has not been excessive, the number of deaths recorded being 243. Scarlatina has continued to decline, and, were it not for the spread of small-pox among the unprotected members of our population, the state of the public health might be regarded with tolerable satisfaction. In the last week of the month there was not a single death from scarlatina registered; the total number of deaths in the month was 14, the weekly numbers being 6, 3, 5, 0. Another sad illustration of the influence of the neglect of sanitary laws upon the progress and issue of this disease has come forcibly under my notice. At 7, George's Place, Upper Holloway, is situated one of the worst constructed and worst managed cow-houses in the parish, very dirty, badly drained, badly paved, badly ventilated, with a receptacle for storing dung for a week or more within the shed, the whole being in close proximity to the dwelling house, which is pervaded by the offensive odour. Its condition was reported to the Sanitary Committee when I made a general inspection of the cowsheds in 1857. On January 12th, two daughters of the dairyman died from malignant scarlet fever, after an illness of 5 and 11 days respectively, and on the 15th, a young man aged 16 years; others in the house also suffered, and among them a young woman, who only owes her recovery to immediate removal to the Fever Hospital. The Metropolitan cow-houses certainly require to be placed under the regular supervision of the sanitary authorities quite as much as the slaughter-houses, and it is 2 seriously be hoped that the legislature will, among the proposed amendments of the Metropolis Local Management Act, sanction the introduction of a similar system of annual licensing in respect of them. The following three deaths from small-pox have occurred : On January 11th, at Small-pox Hospital, from 28, Sidney Street, a Labourer, aged 29 years; duration of illness, 6 days. On January 12th, at 4, Netherland Place, wife of a Cab-driver, aged 38 years; duration of illness, 12 days. On January 20th, at 4, Netherland Place, daughter of a Cab-driver, aged 2 months; duration of illness, 6 days. I am happy to be able to say, that with the commencement of the present year it is proposed to furnish me with a return of the sickness noted at the Islington Dispensary, which will, therefore, henceforth take its place among the Institutions, &c., in Table 2. During the prevalence of small-pox also, I shall introduce the Small-pox Hospital into the Table. The weekly number of cases of scarlatina attended by the Parochial Medical Officers and the Islington Dispensary together, were 7, 4, 4, 6. The weekly number of cases of small-pox were 5, 7, 5, 10. In the parochial practice the number last month was 5, in the January just elapsed it rose to 23. Aided by the Parochial Medical Officers, I am at the present time engaged in visiting all the Charitable and Poor Schools in the Parish, with a view to ascertain how far the children are protected by Vaccination. The Trustees have also arranged to carry out, under my supervision, a plan for ascertaining whether the children whose births have been registered during the past twelvemonth have been Vaccinated in accordance with the Act of Parliament.

No. XXXV. The mortality for February (264) has been much above the average; the increase being attributable to acute pulmonary diseases, which have carried off 88 persons, of whom 60 were under five years of age. The number of deaths from scarlet fever was 15, nearly the same as in January, the weekly numbers being 3, 3, 3, 6. There were 11 deaths from small-pox, the largest number by far that I have hitherto recorded. Of these deaths, 6 were of persons who were attacked with the disease in January. The following are the particulars:— On January 27th, at 11, Cumming Street North, daughter of a Carpenter, aged 3 years; duration of illness, 9 days. Un-vaccinated. On January 31st, at 2, Brunswick Road, Ostler, aged 48 years; duration, 8 days. On January 31st, at Small-pox Hospital, from Islington Workhouse, Shoemaker, aged 31 years ; duration, 11 days. One scarcely perceptible vaccine scar. On February 1st, at 149, City Road, daughter of a Builder's Labourer, aged 1 year; duration, 2 months, sloughing sores, 5 weeks. On February 2nd, at Small-pox Hospital, from 7, Gordon Court, Upper Holloway, male, 9 months ; duration 27 days. Un-vaccinated. On February 9th, at 12, Sydney Street, York Road, daughter of a Coal Porter, aged 10 years; duration, 14 days. Un-vaccinated. On February 14th, at 18, Caledonian Crescent, son of an ostler, aged 22 months; duration, 8 days. Un-vaccinated. On February 15th, at Small-pox Hospital, from 13, Gordon Court, son of a Labourer, aged 4 years; duration, 13 days. Un-vaccinated. 2 On February 18th, at 2, Churchill Place, female, aged 2 years; convulsions following smallpox. On February 19th, at 32, Bemmerton Street, daughter of a Carpenter, aged 3 weeks; duration, 10 days. On February 25th, at Small-pox Hospital, from 49, Richmond Road, female, aged 14 years ; duration 13 days. One indifferent vaccine scar. Since the first week of the month the number of cases of small-pox, which have been returned to me, has greatly fallen off; a fact which is coincident with an almost universal anxiety manifested by the public to avail themselves of the protective influence of vaccination, and of re-vaccination, and with the energetic measures now adopted to search out unprotected children. The weekly number of cases noted by the Parochial Medical Officers, and at the Islington Dispensary, together, were 12, 3, 0, 2. Of the six cases also received from Islington into the Small-pox Hospital, only one entered subsequently to February 8th. The weekly cases of scarlet fever were 5, 8, 7, 7. The cases of pulmonary affections have been unusually numerous. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Offices, March 2nd, 1860. TABLE I.

No. XXXVI. The mortality during March has continued high: 309 deaths were registered. This gives, however, a mean of 62 weekly, which is less than the weekly mean of February, which was 66. Of the corresponding weeks of previous years it approaches nearest to that of 1858 (289), when pulmonary affections were equally fatal, and when the deaths from this cause, under 20 years, were almost precisely the same number (50). Comparing the mortality table with that of former years, we find that the only zymotic disease which has been fatal in excess of the mean is scarlatina, which occasioned 15 deaths against 4, 3, and 6 in former years. It is satisfactory, however, to observe that the deaths from this disease are undergoing a slow diminution. The weekly numbers were 3, 2, 4, 5, 1. The deaths from hooping cough have been more numerous than in February; but have not, even now, reached the average of March for the last 3 years. From small-pox only one death has been registered, viz. :— On March 29th, at Small-pox Hospital, from 14, Upper Bingfield Street, a Policeman on Great Northern Railway, aged 23 years; duration 20 days. Two indifferent vaccine scars. This corresponds with the lessened number of cases noted in my last report as having been observed towards the latter part of February. 2 The amount of general sickness among the recipients of charitable medical aid has been high, viz.: 3237 cases for 5 weeks in the total of Institutions, against 2234 for the 4 weeks of February. In the pauper practice alone the numbers stand 1248 against 869 in February, and against 886, 829, and 1110 in the March of previous years. Of these 3237 cases, 747 were of acute pulmonary disease. In the pauper practice the cases of pulmonary disease numbered 436, against a mean for March of 247. Thirty cases of small-pox were reported to me by the Parochial Surgeons and the two Dispensaries, and the disease is by no means un frequent among the patients of private practitioners. The weekly numbers as returned to me were 4, 4, 13, 4, 5. Nineteen patients entered the Small-pox Hospital from the Parish. That Hospital has already admitted, this year, 384 cases. The number of cases of scarlatina returned by the Parochial Surgeons and Dispensaries is 25 against 30 in the 4 weeks of February. The weekly numbers returned by the former and by the Islington Dispensary together were 9, 7, 1, 2, 4. There were only 2 cases in the Districts attended by the Holloway Dispensary.

No. XXXVII. April has been an unusually cold month. During each of the three latter weeks, the temperature has been below the average. The mean temperature of the second week was thus 4.5 degrees below the average of 43 years; the third week 4, and on some days 7 or 9 degrees below it, and the fourth week 6'6 degrees, and on some days 8 and 11 degrees below it. During the third and fourth weeks the wind was in the N.E. Associated with all this there has been a high mortality, 263 deaths having been registered, the average (uncorrected for population) of the previous four years being 188. The excess has taken place among infants and old persons : of the 263 deaths, 143 occurred in persons under 20 years of age, (68 under one year and 38 between one and two years of age) and 67 over 60 years of age. Of the latter, 11 were above 80 years, and one of them a female was aged 92 years. The diseases which have been more than usually fatal are pulmonary diseases, consumption and diseases of the nervous system. Of the zymotic diseases measles alone has exhibited a tendency to increase. There were only six deaths from Scarlet fever registered and two from Smallpox, viz.:— On April 4th, at 6, Britannia Row, daughter of a Carman, Small-pox, duration 3 weeks, unvaccinated. On April 17th, at 6, Henry Place, daughter of a Bricklayer's Labourer, Small-pox, duration 6 days. There were several other cases in this little house, 2 Judging by the returns of sickness I have received, cases both of scarlatina and small-pox appear to have been less frequent. There were only 9 cases of scarlet fever recorded by the District Medical Officers and the two Dispensaries. Nineteen cases of Small-pox were recorded by the former and only one by the latter. The weekly cases were 4, 5, 6, 5. Four of these cases occurred at 2, Baldwin's Cottages,—some miserable buildings only erected, I believe, to serve a temporary purpose, but which still continue in occupation,—and four in several parts of Elder Walk, where the disease is spreading among the unprotected. On visiting one of the Schools in Elder Walk I found six children absent from this cause. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Offices, May 8th, 1860. TABLE I.

No. XXXVIII. Two hundred and eight deaths of residents in Islington were registered during the four weeks ending May 26th, a considerable reduction upon the mortality of April, but still 41 above the uncorrected mean of the previous four years, viz. 167. Ninety-three deaths were registered under five years of age, and fifteen over eighty years. Measles and diseases of the respiratory organs are the chief of those which were fatal above the average. The deaths from the latter cause, however, have been abating under the influence of milder weather. There have been seven deaths from scarlet fever and three from small-pox, viz.: On April 30th, at 4, Elder Walk, the son of a Builder's Labourer, aged seven months, duration 14 days. Unvaccinated. On May 12th, at 11, Graham Terrace, the daughter of a Porter, aged one year, duration 14 days. Unvaccinated. On May 25th, at Small-pox Hospital, from 36, Linton Street, a married woman, aged 22 years, duration 6 days. Unvaccinated. The weekly deaths from measles have been 2, 2, 3, 8. There have been six deaths from diphtheria, four of which were registered in the first week of the month. One of them occurred at 6, Phoenix Cottages, a house in which three deaths have taken place within as many weeks, the other two being of children from measles and putrid sore-throat. The house has been visited. 2 The table of sickness presents the following as its more important features, viz: 1º. A diminution to one-half of the number of cases of small-pox in the charitable practice of this parish, as compared with those in April, and to the extent of two-thirds as compared with those in March.—2º. A steady increase in the number of cases of measles, 79 cases were recorded by the district Surgeons and Dispensaries against 57 last month and 36 in March : the weekly numbers were 19, 19, 24, 17.—3º. A marked reduction in the number of cases of pulmonary catarrh and bronchitis, viz.: from 426 in April to 215, a number which does not represent more than the amount of illness from this cause, customary in May.

No. XXXIX. The month which has just elapsed has been remarkable, meteorologically, for its comparatively low temperature, and for an almost daily fall of rain. The mean weekly temperatures varied from 3.2 to 5.3 degrees below the mean temperature of the corresponding weeks for 43 years, (Glaisher), and during the 35 days over which this report extends, there were only nine in which more or less rain-fall was not measured at Greenwich. With all this, the health of our population has been tolerably satisfactory. The number of deaths registered was 216, a number which represents a smaller weekly mortality than has occurred since June last year. The uncorrected mean of the four last years was 205. With respect to the diseases embraced in the zymotic class, it is gratifying to be able to announce that the month has passed away without the registration of a single death from small-pox. Measles, however, has occasioned 24 deaths, a very unusual proportion for the month of June. The weekly numbers were 4, 2, 7, 4, 7. There have been 11 deaths from scarlatina. Two of them occurred at 31, Buckingham Street; Mr. Selwood who attended these cases states, that " during the progress of this disease in the family, the Regent's Canal, near the banks of which is their residence, was cleared out, and it is probable that the miasma exhaled by this process caused the low secondary fever, and this materially contributed to the fatal result." The process referred to is always an offensive one, and ought not to be conducted without some sanitary 2 cautions. It has been shown by experiment that the cheap disinfectant, introduced by M. M. Corne and Demeaux, consisting of a mixture of coal-tar with sand or marl is most effectual for this purpose, causing the immediate disappearance of all fœtor and freely developing ozone. There have been only two deaths from diarrhea. The sickness generally among the poor has been very much less than in June of the two last years. The epidemic of small-pox is apparently dying out, only six cases have been returned to me during the month. The number of cases of measles returned by the parochial surgeons and dispensaries together has amounted to 134, the weekly numbers being 26, 21, 22, 40 and 25. There have been as few cases of diarrhoea as in June, 1856. EDAVARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Offices, July 5th, 1860. TABLE I.

The temperature has continued comparatively low throughout the month of July. According to the observations at Greenwich, the weekly mean temperature of the first week of the month was 3 degrees below the mean of 43 years, of the second, 4.3 degrees, of the third, 2.6 degrees, and of the fourth, 6 3 degrees below the mean. The number of deaths of residents registered was 170; the un-corrected mean of the previous four years being 209. The number of deaths from zymotic diseases was 43 against a mean of 74; amongst these there have been 9 deaths from measles, 6 from scarlet-fever, and 2 from small-pox. There have only been 6 fatal cases of diarrhoea, and 1 of dysentery. The injurious influence of the effluvia from animal excretions upon the course of disease, has again been illustrated in one of the best houses in the St. Paul's Road, where the nursery was situated over a filthy stable, (belonging to the landlord of the house,) the offensive smell from which was perceptible before entering the room. Of a family consisting of father, mother, and three children, the father is now alone living, one child having died from abscess, and the mother and two other children of scarlet fever. Fatal cases of typhoid fever also have originated in two adjoining houses in Albany Place, opposite to which was a very offensive gully, to which I have directed the attention of your Surveyor of Sewers. The numbers of cases of sickness admitted under charitable treatment during the month has been small: excluding the cases at the Islington Dispensary, (which were not last year enumerated), they amount to 1213, for comparison 2 with 1713 admitted in July last year. The cases of diarrhoea and dysentery only amounted to 84. Cases of measles have been of less frequent occurrence, especially during the latter half of the month. The following table, which I am in the habit of furnishing during the summer months, represents the progress of bowel complaints in connection with the mean weekly temperature.. July.

No. XLI. We have continued to experience a low mortality. The number of deaths of residents registered during the month being 177, viz.: 111 in the west and 66 in the east sub-district. The un-corrected mean of the previous four years is 184. The deaths from diseases of the zymotic class amounted to 49—the mean for August for the previous four years being 62. There were 24 deaths from diarrhoea and dysentery, 21 of which were of children under three years of age. This number is small for August. There have also been registered the deaths of two persons from cholera. One of these persons was the widow of a publican, and died at the age of 75 years from an attack of ordinary bilious cholera. The other person was a warehouseman, aged 46, engaged all day in the city, but residing at 68, Havelock Street ; he was suddenly seized shortly after midnight, and when visited about five a.m. by his medical attendant, the symptoms of collapse were becoming apparent, and he died on the 15th, after 47 hours illness. Prior to his seizure, when he came home, apparently in his usual health, he had complained to bis wife of a bad smell that "he could not get out of his nose all day," and which had emanated from the grating of a sewer in Goswell Street Road, over which he had unwittingly stood for several minutes on his way to business in the morning, while observing some occurrences in the street. I have been able to discover nothing about the house he occupied which could bear any relation of cause to his attack. 2 The small amount of general sickness prevalent during the month has been matter of universal remark among medical men. The total number of cases returned to me has been 1597 against 1780 in July and 2141 in June. Taking the returns of the Parochial Medical Officers alone, I find a total for the month of only 586 new cases of sickness, the mean of the previous four years being 918. There has been a slight increase in bowel complaints, but from all the returns only 120 cases could be counted up against 397 last year (exclusive of the Islington Dispensary).

No. XLII. The mean weekly mortality of the month just closed has been the same as in August. Two hundred and twenty deaths have been registered, the mean mortality for the previous four years, (un-corrected for increase of population), being 216. The most remarkable feature in the table is the unusual number of 21 young infants whose deaths were registered under the terms "atrophy," "marasmus," or" inanition," the highest number I have hitherto recorded in any month being 14. Two-thirds of these deaths occurred in the east sub-district, and only three were of illegitimate children. The mortality of diseases of the zymotic class amounts to 54, the un-corrected mean of four years being 67. Diarrhoea produced 15 deaths against a mean of about 23. Seven deaths were registered as from diphtheria. In September last year 11 deaths were registered from this affection, and only one in each of the succeeding months. 2 Looking at the table of sickness, we find only two cases of small-pox recorded. Diarrhoea has prevailed more than in August, 168 cases being counted up. Many of them have probably been the result of the use of unwholesome food, especially of the fruits which have ripened very badly this year and have been on sale in the streets in a half-ripened or decaying state. The following table continues that of last month. Sept. Mean Temperature. (Greenwich.) Parish cases of Diarrhoea, &c.

No. XLIII. The mortality which we have experienced during the month of October has been unusually high. The registered deaths were 215, the uncorrected mean of four years being 165. The excess is attributable mainly to diseases of the zymotic class, and to acute and chronic pulmonary maladies. The zymotic diseases occasioned altogether 72 deaths, against an un-corrected mean of 46; and the pulmonary diseases, exclusive of consumption, 38 deaths against an un-corrected mean of 21. During the first two weeks of the month the temperature was below the average, (in the second week 5.8 degrees below it,) and in the two latter it was warmer than usual, with a S.W. wind and much atmospheric moisture. In the fourth week the mean temperature was 5.2 degrees above the average. I regret to say that scarlet-fever, the prevalence of which I had to report last October, has again broken out and carried off 27 persons; the same number as died of it at the same time last year. The weekly deaths were 7, 5, 3, and 12, showing the effect of the warm moist weather towards the close of the month. I must repeat, that with a disease so very infectious as this is, nothing but isolation of the sick will suffice to prevent its spread. Of the 27 fatal cases, 8 occurred in families residing in the better streets of the parish, while 19 occurred in the families of labouring persons, or of those residing in streets or courts where several families crowd into a single house. That, under such circumstances, it should spread from member to member of such families, and from one family to another, and from house to house, as the poison from the multiplication of generating foci becomes more concentrated, is just what might be anticipated. Of the 27 fatal cases, 2 3 occurred in one house in the Sussex Road; 2 in one family at 11, Church Street; 2 in two families at 3, Alfred Place, Balls Pond; and 2 in two families at 10, Angler's Gardens. Thus, out of the whole number, 6 families in 4 houses supplied 9 fatal cases ; and, of the other 18 cases, 5 occurred in streets or houses where fatal cases had already occurred at an earlier period of the year. Few morbid poisons are more subtle, few more difficult to eradicate from a locality, than this. Where persons in crowded houses, suffering from scarlet-fever, are visited by the District Medical Officers, facilities are afforded them, which they are urged to accept, for removal to the Fever Hospital. I have placed myself in communication with the Committee of the Islington Dispensary, with a view to obtaining similar aid from them in the removal of patients attended by their officers. (For other necessary precautions, see my Report for October, 1859.) There have been 5 deaths from diphtheria registered. The amount of general sickness, as registered at the several institutions from which I receive returns, has been 2030 cases. Measles, scarlet fever, and whooping cough have all three been more prevalent than in August; the weekly numbers recorded by the parochial officers and Dispensaries being of Measles, 9, 15, 10, 11, and of scarlet fever, 7, 8, 3, 7. The cases of catarrh and pulmonary inflammation have, as usual at this period of the year, become more numerous, much more so than in October last year.

No. XLIV. The registered deaths for the month of November have been 226; and although less numerous than those of the two former Novembers, they exceed the un-corrected mean of four years by 13, no large number, when the rapid increase of our population is considered. The deaths by diseases of the zymotic class amounted to 44, less by one-fifth than the mean of four years: last month these deaths amounted to 72. The deaths from scarlet fever have fallen from 27 last month to 6. There has been only one death recorded from continued fever, and one from diphtheria. A great many old people have died during the month, 5 of whom were between 80 and 90 years of age; one an independent gentleman was aged 95, and another a widow aged 92 years. Two deaths upon which inquests were held demand some special remarks. One was of a fine little boy, the son of a gentleman residing at Beresford Lodge, Highbury New Park, whose death resulted from poisoning by arsenic, after an acute illness of 38 hours. Within the few days preceding he had been playing with toys in a cupboard of the breakfast-room, and had also while assisting in clearing it out, sucked a piece of lace which was lying there. Both the room and cupboard were papered with a green flock paper. After death arsenic was found in the stomach and liver; and the paper itself was shown to contain one-third of its whole weight of the highly poisonous arsenite of copper (Scheele's green), a piece six inches square, containing 2 no less than 8.44 grains of white arsenic. A little sister was also taken violently ill with convulsions and dysenteric diarrhoea. The fact,that rooms thus papered are unhealthy has been long established by unquestionable evidence, and in the absence of any law to prevent this guilty tampering with human life, surely, it behoves the head of every family to see, that no apartment in his house is thus dangerously ornamented. The arsenic readily separates from the paper, and is then inhaled as dust with every breath of air, and falling upon food, etc , is constantly liable to be taken into the stomach. The other was a case of suicidal poisoning by the essential oil of bitter almonds, and I merely mention it now by way of caution; for as small a quantity as half a teaspoonful (half a drachm) of the oil may be fatal to life. So far as I know it is never used or sold as a medicine— medical men never thus prescribe it. Its sole uses are to impart odour to pomades, etc.; and in food as a flavouring ingredient. The essence (essence of peach kernel, etc.) is merely the oil dissolved in spirit. As usually sold for this purpose both are virulent poisons, and are so by virtue of the large per centage of prussic acid which they contain. Against the sale of such oil, or essence, the public may now protect themselves by the adoption of the recent Act for preventing the adulteration of food. The oil may be readily obtained free from prussic acid, and uninjured as respeets its true flavour and odour; and such oil or essence should alone be purchased by confectioners or cooks, who may insist upon being supplied with it. The table of sickness differing little from that of last month, except in the smaller number of cases of scarlet fever, measles, and sore-throat recorded, calls for no special remark.

No. XLV. Three hundred and eight deaths were registered in the five weeks ending December 29th; a number which is but little in excess of the wn-corrected mean of the four previous years, viz.: 300, and would doubtless be considerably below the average if this were corrected for increased population. The deaths in December last year were 320, and in the previous year 364. The influence of the severe frost which set in on the 18th and continued to the end of the month will probably be perceived in the mortuary table for January.* Twelve deaths from scarlet fever, 15 from hooping cough, and 9 from fever, have been registered, all of which are considerably in excess of last month. The zymotic deaths, however, taken as a class, have not exceeded the uncorrected mean for December. *The mean temp. (Greenwich) of the 4th week of the month was 32.1° or 7.2 degrees below the average of 43 years, and of the 5th week 25.9° or 11 degrees below the average. On Christmas Day the thermometer fell to 8° and on the 29th to 10°. 2 The cases of small-pox referred to in table II. occurred principally in two houses in Denmark Grove. One of them, a child aged 10 weeks, unprotected by vaccination, died at No. 10. Five cases of typhoid fever have arisen in the family occupying the Lodge in Highbury Place, one has proved fatal. The house is unfit to be inhabited; it is wholly undrained and the walls everywhere reeking with moisture. The owner has been served with the necessary notices for improvement.

TO THE VESTRY OF ST. MART, ISLINGTON. Gentlemen, 1. While awaiting the result of the census just taken, it is my duty to present to you my Fifth Annual Report on the Sanitary condition of the Parish. Since it will be necessary when these results are in my possession, to travel again over the same ground, and to review our Sanitary position during 1860 and some previous years in the new light which will then be thrown upon it, I shall abstain now from drawing any general definite conclusions, limiting my remarks upon the Tables which form the basis of the Report within the boundaries that prudence under such circumstances appears to prescribe. MORTALITY. 2. The deaths of residents in Islington which actually occurred between the 1st of January and the 31st December, 1860, amounted to 2845. To these must be added, as fairly belonging to us, 147 of the deaths which took place in the various general and special hospitals, lying-in institutions, and lunatic asylums in London. This addition raises our mortality to 2992, an excess of 181 deaths above the mortality of 1859. 3. The mortality of the two Sub-districts similarly corrected is represented in the West Sub-district by 1511 deaths, and in the East by 1481. That of the West, therefore, is higher by 16 than the mortality of 1859, and that of the East higher by 165 deaths. 4. The births registered during the year amounted to 5184, viz. 2655 males and 2529 females; the total number being precisely equally distributed between the two Sub-districts thus:— 1860 West Sub-District. East Sub-District. Whole Parish. Males. Females Total. Males. Females Total. Males. Females Total. 1st Quarter 354 342 696 330 318 648 684 660 1344 2nd Quarter 286 304 590 319 316 635 605 620 1225 3rd Quarter 319 303 622 344 323 667 663 626 1289 4th Quarter 364 320 684 339 303 642 703 623 1326 Total 1323 1269 2592 1332 1260 2592 2655 2529 5184 4 5. The deaths which occurred in each week and quarter of the year are represented in Table II. There was one week, viz. that ending June 23, during which only 25 persons died in the Parish : the lowest mortality during any week in five years. The low mortality of the third or summer quarter was unquestionably associated as an effect with the comparatively low temperature which prevailed and the abundant rainfall, which effectually cleansed the surface and flushed the drains and sewers. 6. Of the 2845 persons of whose deaths I possess the record, 1410 were males and 1435 females. 1382 or 48.5 per cent. were children under 5 years of age. The Infant deaths in four previous years were 1066, 1108, 1238, and 1215. The infant mortality, then, exceeds that of 1859 by 167, a number which, within 14, represents the whole excess of mortality (181) over 1859. CAUSES OF DEATH. a. Zymotic Diseases. 7. Of the deaths recorded in Table I. 663 are attributed to maladies of the zymotic class. Under the classification now adopted, it will be observed that causes of death are now embraced under this class which were formerly excluded; nevertheless, the number of deaths recorded has been unusually small. The number tabulated in 1859 was 746. In the 'miasmatic' division, which pretty nearly corresponds with the former ' zymotic class,' the deaths amount to 632; viewed in this light the mortality thus represented amounts to 114 less than last year. It will be seen also by Table V. that the number of cases of disease of this class attended by the Parochial Surgeons fell short of the number of similar cases in the three previous years. This result is mainly due to the small amount of diarrhoea and other bowel affections, which the temperate summer brought out. 8. Small Pox. When the year 1859, to which my last Report referred, terminated, we were in the midst of an epidemic of small-pox. Since then the epidemic has in great measure died out, not, however, without leaving its impression on very numerous victims, 26 of whom, viz. 10 males and 16 females, it has consigned to the grave. We may now perhaps enter with advantage upon a brief retrospect of its course and progress. Thanks to the facilities afforded me by the Board of Trustees, the kind co-operation of the Parochial Medical Staff, of the Medical Officers of the Dispensaries and especially their Resident Officers, as well as of private practitioners, I am, I think, in a position to trace, although imperfectly, the outline of the course the epidemic pursued in Islington. I say imperfectly, for although I have been able to ascertain the occurrence and locality of 272 cases, yet there were very many others which I heard of by chance, the particulars of which I was debarred from obtaining. The places where these occurred appear in Table VII. The enumeration commences with the beginning of 1859, and proceeds month by month till December 1860. 5 The following is an abstract of the table:— Cases. Upper Holloway. Lower Holloway. Highbury. Thornhill, Barnsbury. St. Mary. Canonbury. St. Peter's.

The epidemic was now declining, 7 cases being the largest number returned to me from all sources during any succeeding month. The monthly mortality of the disease may be gathered from Table II. The largest number of deaths occurred in the months of January and February. In March, April, and May, although the disease still prevailed extensively, only 6 deaths occurred from it—its virulence was from some cause checked. This will appear more clearly on comparing the fatality of the cases prior and subsequently to the close of February 1860. Up to this time, according to the above table, 178 cases came under notice, of which 36 or 21 per cent. were fatal. From March to December 102 cases occurred, of which only 10 or 9'8 per cent. were fatal. This result is remarkable. The parts of the Parish which, so far as my information extends, suffered most, were the Wards of Upper Holloway, Thornhill, and St. Peter's. These also were the Wards, as appears from Table III. of the present and last year's Report, in which the mortality was greatest. The parts which were least affected were Highbury and St Mary's Wards. The streets, courts, &c., in which the disease appeared to spread most, were the following :— In Upper Holloway—Gordon Court, in which I ascertained the occurrence of 7 cases and 3 deaths; Brunswick Road, in which I found 7 cases and 5 deaths; 6 man's Place North and Bowman's Mews, in which together there were 9 cases and 2 deaths; Upper Whittington Place, 3 cases. In Lower Holloway—Blundell Street gave 4 cases and 1 death, and George Street 4 cases. In Thornhill Ward—I ascertained in Netherland Place 8 cases and 2 deaths; in Caledonia Street, 10 cases; in Sydney Street, 4 cases and 2 deaths ; in Bemerton Street, 4 cases and 1 death. In Barnsbury Ward—I ascertained in Denmark Grove, 7 cases and 1 death; in Henry Place, 5 cases and 1 death. In St. Mary's Ward—I ascertained in Albert Square, 4 cases. In Canonbury Ward—I ascertained in Frederick's Place, Balls Pond, 3 cases and 1 death. In St. Peter's Ward—I ascertained in Pickering Street, 4 cases; in Sidney Grove (where scarlet fever formerly prevailed to a frightful extent—see Report for 1859, p. 5), 9 cases; in Elder Walk, 8 cases and 1 death; in Britannia Row, 6 cases and 1 death. The names of most of these places are already familiar to you as those where the population is crowded, ignorant, and careless, and where other zymotic maladies flourish and extend. It is interesting, and perhaps may be instructive, to notice the order in which these several districts were attacked by the epidemic. Compared with the population of the districts, the Ward which earliest exhibited the greatest proportion of cases was Upper Holloway, the locality earliest and most severely attacked being the neighbourhood of the Small-Pox Hospital. Even in 1858 two deaths from small-pox had occurred in Gordon Court. From July 1859 to March 1860, 27 cases, 11 of which were fatal— between a half and a third of the whole number—occurred within my knowledge in this Ward and neighbourhood. It is difficult to divert one's mind of the idea that this high fatality might not only have been attributable to the period of the epidemic, but to the large doses of the atmospheric poison imbibed. From Upper Holloway the disease appears to have travelled in its greatest intensity into Thornhill Ward. Cases appeared to have become more numerous there during the summer months of 1859, 14 cases, only 2 of which, or one-seventh, were fatal, having been noticed between May and September. In December, just as the disease appeared to be subsiding somewhat in Upper Holloway, came the first warnings of the renewed outbreak in Thornhill Ward, and between this time and March 53 cases occurred, of which 10, or about one-fifth, were fatal. Lower Holloway and Highbury Wards about the same time felt to a more moderate extent the shock of the epidemic, 16 cases with only 1 death, however, occurring in the former Ward, and 9 cases, without any death, in the latter. In fact, it is well worthy of remark that, in Highbury and St. Mary's Wards, no single death from small-pox occurred throughout the two years. In St. Peter's Ward the violence of the epidemic appeared late. Cases had occurred throughout the epidemic, but had not exceeded 6 in the month (of November). As the disease, however, was subsiding in Thornhill, it began to spread more extensively in this part of the Eastern Sub-district, 31 cases having come to my knowledge during March, April, and May, 1860, of which 5 or one-sixth were fatal. Taking the entire number of cases in each Ward, the fatality of the disease was 7 as follows, placing the Wards in the order of greatest fatality or virulence of the epidemic:— Upper Holloway 30 per cent. of cases were fatal. St.Peter's 20 ditto ditto Canonbury 18 ditto ditto Thornhill 16 ditto ditto Lower Holloway 11 ditto ditto Barnsbury 11 ditto ditto St. Mary, Highbury None fatal. The measures which were taken to arrest the progress of the epidemic in this parish may now be briefly recalled. Having placed myself in communication with the Board of Trustees in the month of January, when the disease was assuming serious proportions, I undertook to examine personally the children attending all the charitable schools in the Parish, with a view to satisfying myself as to their vaccination. In this work I was accompanied in each instance by one of the vaccinators of the district. The Trustees also provided me with the necessary assistance for the delivery of handbills in such localities as the information I received each morning pointed out as new foci of infection. These handbills, and large posting bills also distributed over the Parish, were designed to call public attention to the necessity of immediate vaccination, and in certain instances of re-vaccination. And, lastly, another most valuable and efficient assistant was provided me by the appointment of Dr. J. Thompson as a Vaccine Inspector, to inquire into the vaccination of all uncertificated children born within the previous year, with power to vaccinate when he thought it desirable—a power which he exercised under certain restrictions, which, for professional reasons, I thought fit to impose. The operation of all this was what was most to be desired. The public generally were awakened to the presence of the pest among them, and to the adoption of the best means to arrest its progress. Not only were the public vaccinations greatly increased, but private practitioners, without exception, informed me that the applications for vaccination made to them on the part of individuals and families were also very numerous. Similar steps were taken in other Parishes. I firmly believe that in this Parish the energetic measures adopted during the early months of the year, and the stimulus given to protective vaccination must be regarded as one of the main causes of the remarkable check which the epidemic received, and especially of that diminution in virulence which (apart from the spread of the malady) was noticed subsequently to March. And now I am upon the. subject of vaccination, I should like to place on record my conviction that the great sub-division of the public vaccination in this Parish is not calculated to promote its efficiency, because it interposes difficulties which no considerations of convenience to the poor can counterbalance. For such a Parish as this, three, or at most four, well-chosen vaccine stations are as many as ought to be provided, and at these the vaccination, except where there is immediate danger of small-pox, should be performed only once or at most twice a-week. The difficulty to be met in this, that in order to produce good pocks, and thoroughly to protect, the lymph should be taken from selected children, and used fresh from arm to arm. In order to do this, the district assigned to each vaccinator must be large enough, and the days of operation limited enough to bring together on each day eight or ten children, at least, who had been vaccinated eight days previously. From these the best arm could be selected 8 for perpetuation of the supply of lymph. I fear I am not making a very popular suggestion here, but I do it in the interest of the public health, that interest, which, in my position, I am bound first to consider. It is for the Board of Trustees to reflect upon this. Their motive for multiplying the stations as they have done is doubtless most creditable, but founded upon a mistake. The only alternative to this restriction, consistently with the public benefit, appears to be to throw open the public vaccination to all practitioners who chose to work it, and to pay the fee prescribed by the Act for every vaccination certified as successful by some independent Inspector. Private interest on this arrangement would be enlisted in the public service, for young unoccupied medical men might be expected readily to enter upon this branch of practice. Still this is an arrangement which would be open to other and grave objections. Measles.—One hundred and thirteen deaths occurred from this disease, the average of the last four years being 77. The five Wards which constitute the southern half of the Parish were those which furnished the greatest number (see Table III). Judging from Table V. this malady has been more prevalent among the poor, as well as more fatal than in either of the other three former years. Scarlet Fever occasioned 135 deaths during the year; last year the deaths were 216. The first and fourth quarters were those in which it chiefly prevailed. The number of cases which were attended on behalf of the Parish and by the Holloway Dispensary were 193; last year the cases thus attended amounted to 472. There has, therefore, been a decline in the prevalence of this disease. I have frequently called attention to the highly infectious character of scarlatina; let me add another fact which may assist to impress upon the minds of the parishioners the important lesson in preventive medicine which I have been so anxious to teach. Of the 135 fatal cases, 68 occurred in 30 streets, and 37 in 17 houses in those streets. In other words, out of 97 streets where scarlatina deaths took place there were 30 in which from 2 to 4 deaths occurred, and there were 17 houses where from 2 to 3 deaths occurred. Measles is an infectious disease, but the difference in infection and in fatality appears from this, viz., that while there were 18 streets, &c., in which 42 deaths occurred, or from 2 to 4 in a street, there were but 4 houses in which 2 deaths occurred from measles in the year. Can I more strongly enforce my repeated warning that cases of scarlet fever should be immediately isolated, and, where a house is at all crowded, removed as soon as possible to the Fever Hospital? I cannot avoid expressing a belief that had these ordinary precautions been taken, some, at least, of these 37 lives sacrificed to scarlet fever might have been saved. Whooping Cough.—This is another disease, the prevalence of which, as well as the mortality occasioned by it, has been below the average. Of 92 deaths 35 took place in the course of the last quarter of the year. Fever.—The deaths attributed to continued and infantile fever, together, amounted to 76 ; the mean of the previous four years being 82. Bowel complaints, diarrhcea, dysentery, and cholera, together, occasioned only 80 deaths ; in former years the numbers were 120,147, 99, and 135. During the summer quarter they proved fatal to only 49 persons, the number in previous summer being 83, 104, 65, and 109. The number of cases attended by the Parochial Surgeons also shows the favourable influence of this remarkable season in relation to these disorders. They amounted altogether only to 509, the number in former years being 1086, 669, and 1058. 9 Diphtheria appears to hare become an established disease amongst us like measles or scarlet fever. Thirty-five deaths, 22 of children under 5 years of age, were referred to it. This, however, seems to be some improvement upon former years. b. Constitutional Diseases. 9. Five hundred and twenty-three deaths are referred in Table I. to this class of diseases. The most important and definite malady it embraces is pulmonary consumption. To this 313 deaths have been attributed; the mean of four previous years being 305. The total number, and that of the deaths in each Sub-district, is nearly the same as in 1858. c. Local Diseases. 10. To the so-called local diseases 1218 deaths were attributed. Diseases of the organs of respiration carried off 622, or more than half of these persons. So high a mortality from these maladies has not occurred during the previous four years, the numbers being 392, 422, 494, and 375. Stated, in periods of 13 weeks each, from January 1 to December 29, the deaths in each quarter were— 1st quarter 251, the mean of four years being 143 2nd ditto 127, ditto ditto 87 3rd ditto 60, ditto ditto 48 4th ditto 174, ditto ditto 141 Of these deaths 338 were under 5 years of age, giving an increase of infant deaths for this over the former years of 77 from these diseases. It is thus that the cold and wet weather we experienced made up to us the mortality which a hot summer would have brought about in another way. d. Developmental Diseases. 11. Among the 354 deaths tabulated thus, we find those of 128 infants (107 of whom were under 1 year of age), attributed to " atrophy and debility." The deaths of 62 are said to be due to their having been born prematurely. A glaring defect in our system of birth registration prevents us from either knowing or investigating the number of children said to be " still-born." e. Violent Deaths. 12. Of these there were 72. Forty-three are attributed to accidence or negligence, 10 to suicide, and 12 were held to be the result of premeditated violence—they were murdered persons. True, they were infants that were murdered, but the little insight even thus afforded us into the gulf of crime of which these murders are the last and deepest products, should induce reflection. While considering this class of deaths we stand with one foot upon the domain of the moralist, but only with one. Religious teaching, training in schools, churches, missionary efforts to reclaim the outcast and fallen are good enough and useful enough in their way, but what can religious teaching, what can moral training avail, when home influences and home surroundings are such as to forbid, I was about to say religious and moral practices, but the merest decencies of family life. What, think you, would be the verdict if the true history were known of the 67 deaths of illegitimate and deserted children included in the mortality tables for 1860? 20 of them—a most disproportionate number—were said to have died from "atrophy," "continual wasting," "congenital debility," &c.; how many of these were the victims of wilful neglect ? 4 of them were said to have died 10 from " want of breast milk"—three in Islington Workhouse between the 10th of October and the 2nd of November. The proportion of mothers who cannot suckle their infants, if they choose, is not 4 in 67. Ten, or more than one-sixth, of those under 2 years died in "convulsions!" Again a large proportion. Brain symptoms, which thus terminate, and may thus be registered, arise from other besides natural causes. Ten were downright murdered, one having had its throat cut; one was permitted to bleed to death from the navel; three died from venereal contamination. SANITARY WORK OF THE YEAR. 13. Table VI. is a summary of the house inspections made, and the amendments effected in dwelling-houses during the year ending March 25, 1861. It does not however, include all the work carried out under the superintendence of your Sanitary Officers, as the removal of offensive and injurious accumulations of various kinds, the discontinuance of the use of underground sleeping-rooms, and the lessening, after notice from the office, of the number of inhabitants in various overcrowded houses. Frequently during the year, and especially in the summer, fruit, fish, and meat, in a state unfit for food, has been seized and destroyed. The filthy and unwholesome state of many of the stable and cab yards in the Parish, to the effluvia from which on several occasions I have seen good reason to attribute fatal disease in their vicinity, has induced me to undertake a systematic inquiry in relation to them. In the West Sub-district 66 stables have been inspected, and in the East eighty. Two very unhealthy cow-sheds have been done away with, one situated in George's Place, which I referred to in my 34th Monthly Report, and another (after summoning the owner) in the Lower Road. Prior to the annual licencing in October 52 slaughter-houses were inspected in the West Sub-district, two of which were opposed ; the licences to those two were refused by the Magistrates. In the East Sub-district the number of slaughter-houses inspected and licensed was 59. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your very obedient Servant, EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., M.R.C.P., etc. Vestry Offices, Medical Officer of Health. May 10M, 1861. Postscript.— Since the above was written, the total population of the Parish, as ascertained by the recent census, has (subject to revision) been made known. It amounted to 155,291. The ten years just elapsed have consequently added to our numbers 59,962 persons. This is an increase at the rate of 5 per cent, each year, upon the population of the preceding one. Assuming this rate to have been uniform through the ten years, the population of each may be readily calculated in the same way as the accumulation of capital at compound interest. 11 The following Table exhibits the population of Islington thus estimated at the spring of each year from 1856 to 1860.

Islington stands in respect to the mode of increase of its population in a remarkable position. During the ten years from 1851 to 1861, the increase of population in London by immigration of strangers was l-4th less than the natural increase by excess of births over deaths. In Islington, during the five years of my official connexion with the parish, the increase by immigration was absolutely one and a third times greater than that by natural increase. Of course, whatever sanitary advantages the older residents in the parish have enjoyed, these new comers every year bring in themselves the results of those less sanitary conditions in which they have hitherto dwelt, and which render the general death-rate of England about 220 in the 10,000. No one can study the table I have given above without seeing three things—first, that notwithstanding our rapid growth by immigration, our average death-rate has been comparatively low, viz., 202 per 10,000 ; secondly, that wherever in the five years the death-rate has risen, it has been in connexion with the increased influx of strangers from without (see years 1858 and 1860); thirdly, that in the course of the year even these strangers, incorporated into our community, derive the benefit of the sanitary advantages afforded them in a diminished death-rate (comparing the death-rate of 1859 with that of 1858). Were our increase to be simply or mainly that by birth, it is probable that our death-rate would not exceed 190 in the 10,000. E. B. June 20th, 1861. TABLE I.
