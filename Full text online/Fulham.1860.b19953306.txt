Pursuant to Sec. 198 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, this Board present to their Constituents a Report of their proceedings during the past year. Numerons complaints having been made by the Market Gardeners and others of Fulham, relating to the unequal benefits received by land from lighting as compared with house and other property, and requesting the Board to serve orders on the Overseers to make differential rates, they, the Board, have anxiously considered all the circumstances of the case, and although resolved not to order the making of such differential rates, they considered it only just that the property of the complainants should be better lighted, and to secure this end they arranged with the London Gas Light Company for the erection of 64 additional lights in that parish. The number of lights in Fulham are now 211, and in Hammersmith 424. In the parish of Hammersmith there have been laid down during the past year 4473-ft. of 3-in. new Yorkshire pavement, and 476-ft. new Guernsey granite kerb. The gravel paths and the roads having been much injured by the excessive wet and frost of the past season, must, in order to put them now into a proper state of repair, necessarily occasion the estimates for material for the ensuing year to be considerably in excess of those of former years. By negociating with the owners of property in the King's Road, Fulham, a great improvement has resulted in considerably widening the road at Sand's End Lane, which previously was most inconvenient and dangerous. The Board refer with satisfaction to the completion of the Acton line of sewer, whereby a large and improving neighbourhood, heretofore only partially drained, is now provided with an outlet sufficient for the removal of the numerous nuisances arising from defective 4 drainage, and which nuisances spread over nearly the whole of the northern parts of the parish of Hammersmith. Great improvements under the direction of the Board, have re suited from the carrying out of a part of their scheme for the local drainage of the district. In Bradmore, where a constant nuisance existed from the overflowing of cesspools and privies, a sewer 680-ft. in length has been made, to which the owners of property contiguous thereto have liberally contributed, and gladly availed themselves of the benefit thereof. In the streets known as Warple Way and Bevor Lane, which were always flooded after showers of rain, there having been no means of escape for storm water, a sewer 720 feet in length has been constructed, towards which the owner of property adjacent contributed his proportion of the cost. The Board have had under lengthened consideration a plan for the Embankment of the River Thames from the Suspension Bridge to the Western end of the Upper Mall, Hammersmith, and in connection therewith the pulling down the small old houses situate on the South side of the Lower Mall, known as "Little Wapping;" and as this would effect a great public improvement, independent of the Embankment, and would also be necessary thereto, they have entered into an arrangement with the several owners to accomplish that object. Mr. Bird and Mr. Swail have consented to give up their cottages, and the Other parties to sell theirs for £420; the Metropolitan Board have resolved to contribute one third of the cost of effecting this public improvement. The Board have had deposited with them' schemes for the construction of railways in and through the district, and having had conferences with the promoters of the "Hammersmith, Paddington, and City Junction Railway," they have secured that bridges be constructed over the several parish and public roads of the full span thereof; and believing that such railway would, by opening a direct communication between Hammersmith and the City, thus affording facilities with most of the principal lines having stations in the Metropolis, be a great boon to the parish, they gave their concurrence to such promoters to obtain the passing of their Bill through Parliament. The Board are urging upon the Metropolitan Board the necessity of immediately carrying out their scheme for the Drainage of this District, and especially with reference to the New Road, Hammersmith, as by such means the open Stamford Brook Sewer, a serious nuisance to the inhabitants of that part, may be abandoned, and its sewerage diverted by the construction of a sewer along the said New Road to the High Road, and from thence along the High Road to the Albion Road, where its permanent outlet is already formed. 5 During the past year, 737 cases of nuisance have been investigated, and removed:— Privies and cesspools emptied 338 Drains and gulHes cleansed and repaired 149 Houses 85 Swine nuisances removed 56 Miscellaneous 109 737 Houses benefited in Fulham 402 ,, Hammersmith 380 782 With reference to the sanitary condition of this district the Board refer their constituents to the Report of the Medical Officer of Health, which, together with an abstract of contracts and accounts, they have directed to be published herewith. abstract of contracts entered into by the board during the year ending 25th march, 1861.

FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, 1860. presented to the sanitary committee, July 26th, 1861. Gentlemen, On a review of 1800 in its sanitary bearings, the most remarkable features are presented in its meteorological conditions, the influences of which are to be specially traced in the mortality and sickness of the year. The effect of the unusual cold of February (the mean low night temperature of which was more than 3 below the average), was visible in the death rate during the following month from diseases of the organs of respiration, tubercular diseases, (amongst which is consumption) and deaths in aged persons, together amounting to 47 out of a total of 87 deaths in the month ; whilst in April the consequences were still marked, by the termination of more chronic cases of the same diseases, causing 47 out of 80 deaths. Again in December, 59 deaths resulted from the same causes out of a total of 94, this month giving the highest mortality of the year. The temperature of November according to Mr. Glaisher was about 3 below the daily average, whilst the weather in December was remarkable in severity, particularly at its latter part; the mean temperature of the month was 4 below the average, and diseases of the organs of respiration alone cut off 29 persons in the two parishes in the latter month. Throughout the year there has been a most extraordinary absence of sunshine and bright weather, a mean of fully three-fourths of the surface of the sky having been noted as covered by cloud at 9 a.m. The rainfall also has been excessive, and has amounted to 31.41 inches, (having fallen on 216 days) a larger quantity than has been measured in this district since my appointment as Officer of Health. 7 The amount caught in the rain gauge at Greenwich has been 32 inches, which is greater than in any year since 1815, except 1821, 1824, and 1852. Passing to the periods ofleast mortality we find that they occurred in Fulham during the months of May, June, and August; whilst in Hammersmith fewer deaths were registered in June, August, and September. In May the day and night temperatures were somewhat warmer than usual, and in June both were cool, with rapid motion of the air. In August and September the temperature was considerably below the average throughout. The total number of deaths registered in the District has been 827, (or about 20 per thousand of the population, as ascertained by the recent census) 526 of which have been contributed by the working classes. In accordance with what our meteorological data would indicate, by far the largest mortality has been furnished by diseases of the organs of respiration, and those of the tubercular or consumptive class, amounting together to nearly 314, or nearly 38 per cent. of the total deaths, whilst diarrhoea, generally very productive, this year gives only 11. Consumption has cut off 106 persons; 84 have succumbed to the ordinary influence of age and infirmity, of these 51 had reached 80 years and upwards, amongst them being 8 nonagenarians, the oldest having attained 98 years. Infant mortality still retains a high rate. Of the 827 deaths in the District, 316, or 38 per cent. were of children under 5 years of age, 169 of which had not reached 1 year. Ten deaths have occurred in Almshouses, 54 in the Union "Workhouse, 31 in Roman Catholic Charitable Institutions, and 16 in Lunatic Asylums during the year; 33 Inquests have also been held. Amongst the cases of sickness coming under the care of the Union Medical Offieers, there have been only 57 of diarrhoea compared with 130 in 1859, and 14 of scarlatina compared with 59 in the same year, but fever cases somewhat increased in numbers, presenting 39 against 29 in 1859. Of the cases of diarrhoea North End gave 11; Walham Green and Fulham Fields, 7; the Rookery and Slater's Buildings, 14; and the Latymer Road, 6. Of fever cases North End gave 7; Walham Green, 10; Sands End 3; Crown Street, 3; and the Rookery 7. Of those of scarlatina, 6 occurred in North End; 3 in the Rookery; and 2 in the Latymer Road. Thirty-one cases of small pox have been also returned by the Union Officers, of which 6 arose in North End; 3 in Walham Green; 5 in Fulham Town; and 6 in Fulham Fields. In Hammersmith, 2 in Trafalgar Street; 1 in the Latymer Road; 8 1 in Queen Street; 2 in Gold Hawk Road; 3 in St. Peter's; and 1 each in Argyle Place and Garden Grove. Measles have considerably prevailed, and 02 pauper cases have been returned, of which Walham Green furnished 12; Sands End, 7; Fulham Fields, 11; the Rookery, 9; Latymer Road, 3; Queen Street, 7. One case of ague was reported in North End; 1 in Crown Street; 1 in the Rookery; 1 in Frog Island; and 1 in Starch Green. The largest number of pauper cases of sickness occurred in January, September, and December, and the smallest in May, June, and October. Upwards of 3000 cases of sickness and accidents have come under treatment at the West London Hospital, amongst which have been 33 of Rheumatic Fever; 341 of Bronchitis and Catarrh; 20 of Dysentery, 43 of Fever; 144 of Diarrhoea; 53 of Hooping Cough; 22 of Measles; 1G of Smallpox and; 1 of Scarlatina. In consequence of the prevalence of small pox in the early part of the year, I examined, by the permission of the several authorities, the whole of the children in the parochial and Charity Schools of the District, for the purpose of ascertaining the extent to which vaccination had been performed, and for taking the necessary steps to ensure the same where neglected, a labour much facilitated by the kind co-operation of the Board of Guardians, and their medical officers. The District of St. Peter's, Hammersmith, shows, as usual, its favourable position as regards mortality, 12 weeks out of the year having occurred in which no death was registered therein. The population of St. Peter's is now 5,413. The number of births registered in the District have been 1,176, shewing an excess of births over deaths of 349. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Yours Obediently, FREDERICK J. BURGE, Medical Officer of Health. 9 AUDITORS' CERTIFICATE. Board Room, Broadway House, Hammersmith, June 19, 1861. We hereby certify that we have carefully examined the Accounts and Books of Accounts of the Board of Works for the Fulham District, for the year ending 25th day of March, 1861, and have compared them with the vouchers, and find the several receipts and entries thereof to be correct, and, with one exception, that all the disbursements and payments are properly made and entered. The payment we refer to is one of £283 11s. 4d., made on the 19th day of February, 1861, for the plaintiff's costs in legal proceedings instituted by Ferdinand Scott, Esq., against the Board, and which proceedings, in our opinion, should not have been defended, as no possible right has been shewn to us for the measures adopted by the Board. Therefore, as far as we lawfully can or may, we disallow that payment, and do not admit the same to be a proper item of credit in the Cash Account, the balance of which will therefore be £606 10s. 2d., instead of £322 18s 10d. We find that amounts are due from Fulham and Hammersmith Parishes, which we hope the parochial authorities of both will take the earliest opportunity to discharge; and we would beg to impress on their minds the injustice that is really done to all parties, ratepayers as well as the Board, not only by the delay in payment of accounts, but by the losses arising through removals ere the rates are collected, and thus arrears becoming heavier than is fair towards the early ratepayers.
