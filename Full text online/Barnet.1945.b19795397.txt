To the Chairman and Members of the Barnet Urban District Council. Mrs. Hughes and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report giving particulars of the measures carried out in. my Department during the year 1945, in administering the Health Acts and Bye-Laws in force in the District. Owing to reduction in Staff, and to the large amount of work the Department is responsible for in connection with the Civil Defence Casualty Services, it has not been possible to do more than submit my report in a very condensed form, as compared with those of pre-war years. It is, therefore, in the main a statistical report. It is hoped that with the passing of the Civil Defence duties and the return of staff from the forces that a more informative report will be possible in future. INSPECTION OP DISTRICT. General Inspections of the District have been carried out from time to time and all complaints investigated. The course of serving a preliminary or intimation notice upon the person in default, specifying the works necessary to abate the nuisance, continues to be followed, and only if a person fails to comply with this preliminary notice, or strict legal procedure is necessary in the first instance, is the matter reported to the Council and a statutory notice asked for.

Two-hundred and sixty nine cases of burst pipes occurred during the year and repairs were carried out to same. In six cases the water was cut off owing to the non-payment of rates. This department was notified by the Barnet Gas and Water Company, and steps were taken which resulted in the early reconnection of the supply. FACTORIES ACT. 1957. Forty-two inspections of factories with mechanical power and twenty-one inspections of factories without mechanical power were made during the year, including bake-houses.

No certificates of adequate means of escape in case of fire were issued by the Council under section 54 of the Act, HOUSING ACT 1936 - OVERCROWDING. As a result of the war it has been impossible to administer the provisions of the above Act with regard to overcrowding. An effort has, however, been made to prevent any serious overcrowding. The files contain particulars of 3,632 surveys most of which were carried out prior to the war. They will, however, form a useful basis when a fresh start can be made with this important matter.
