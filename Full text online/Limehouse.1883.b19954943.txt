Upon surveying the six houses 1 reported that the defects in the premises could not be remedied by structural alterations and improvements, and that the whole of the houses ought to be demolished. A Committee consisting of the members of the Hoard having inspected the Court, recommended the Hoard to make an application to the Magistrate at the Thames Police Court for an order under the Nuisances Removal Act to close the houses. The application was made and the Magistrate ordered that the houses should be closed.

The matter having been referred to the Works Committee for consideration and report, and with power to confer with the promoters of the scheme, the representatives of the promoters of the East London Tramways Company and the North Metropolitan Tramways Company had an interview with the Committee, at which Mr. Ommanney, Solicitor, appeared for the East London Company, and Mr. Hopkins, C.E. for the North Metropolitan Company and explained the nature of the respective schemes. Subsequently I made a report upon the two schemes and the Committee inspected the West India Dock Road, and recommended the Board to consent to the scheme of the promoters of the East London Tramways Company, upon condition that the terminus in this district be opposite the centre of No. 4, West India Dock Road, instead of at the point shewn on the deposited plan, such consent not to prejudice the loots standi of the Board to appear Wfore the Parliamentary Committee, for procuring the insert ion of such clauses as the Board may think necessary for the protection of the district Petitions were presented to the Board in favour of the scheme, signed by employers of labour and others interested in the trade of the Isle of Dogs, and by owners, occupiers of premises in the West India Dock Road, and by workmen employed in the Isle of Dogs ; and also a petition signed by a large number of Ratepayers, in the parishes of Poplar and Linn-house.

The Dock Company were informed in reply, that the Board had given their consent to the Bill, only so far as it related to the Limehouso District. The Solicitors to the Bill wrote, asking the Board to appoint a Deputation to wait on the Metropolitan Board of Works to support the Bill, and a Deputation was appointed, but a further letter was received from Messrs. Sutton & Ominauney, stating that the Metropolitan Board had refused to give their consent to the Tramways, and asking this Board to refuse their consent to the North Metropolitan Company's Scheme. The Board declined to give their consent to the North Metropolitan Company's Scheme, and passed a resolution requesting the Poplar Board to join this Board in presenting a memorial to the Metropolitan Board, asking them to reconsider their decision with reference to the East London Tramways Company's Bill, and the Poplar Board replied, that the whole of their Board would attend as a Deputation in support of the Memorial.

Mr. Hopkins, C.E., the Engineer of the Company, attended before the Works Committee to whom the matter was referred, and explained the nature of the scheme, and the Committee requested me to make an official report thereon. The Committee subsequently inspected the West India Dock Road, and recommended the Board to defer giving their consent to the Scheme. A resolution to the following effect was unanimously carried:— " That the Board decline to give their consent to tho " Tramway proposed to be constructed in the West India " Dock Road by the North Metropolitan Tramways " Company." TOWER (DUPLEX) BRIDGE BILL. The Solicitors to the Tower (Duplex) Bridge Bill, addressed a letter to tho Board, asking to be furnished with tho views of tho Board, and, in the event of the Board's decision being favourable, requesting that they would support the Bill and present a petition in its favour.

The matter was referred to the Works Committee, and the Bill was subsequently abandoned. Thames Communications—Conference of Delegates re Nightingale Lane Scheme. On the 21st November, 1883, the Board having considered a letter from the Metropolitan Board of Works stating they could not accede to the request of this Board to be furnished with a copy of the Report of their Engineer, of the 15th October, 1883, and of the plan accompanying the same, relative to the proposed Tunnel from Nigliingale Lane to Bermondsey, passed .a Resolution to the effect that the Districts of Hackney, Betlinal Green, Shoreditch, Mile End old Town, Poplar, St. George-in-the-East, and Whitechapel should be invited to appoint Delegates to confer with those appointed by ths Board upon the subject of the proposed Tunnel. In response to such request, Delegates were appointed by the following District Boards and Vestries, viz. :—Hackney, Poplar, Bethnal Green, Whitechapel, St. George-in-the-East and Whitechapel. Meetings were held, and the following Resolutions were passed :— "That, in the opinion of this Conference, the Nightingale " Lane Tunnel Scheme of the Metropolitan Board of "Works, as now submitted to Parliament, is altogether "unsuitable for the purposes alleged as regards site, " approaches, and convenience of vehicular traffic; and 14 that the same ought to be abandoned." "That in the event of such Scheme not being abandoned, "the Conference is of opinion that it should be opposed "by the several Districts by every means in their power." Copies of such Resolutions were sent to the Vestries and District ^Boards of the Metropolis, the Metropolitan Board of Works, the City Corporation, and to the Metropolitan and Middlesex Members of Parliament, and on the 1st February, 1884, the Conference attended as a Deputation to the Metropolitan Board of Works in support of a Memorial embodying such Resolutions. Mr. John Abbott introduced the Deputation, and Mr. A. McAlister, the Chairman of the Conference, addressed the Board in support of the Memorial. After considerable discussion, the Metropolitan Board resolved to refer the Memorial to the Works and General Purposes, and the Parliamentary Committees. A summary of the proceedings of the Conference having been forwarded to the District Boards and Vestries represented thereat, the Limehousc, Hackney, and Poplar District Boards, and the Vestry of Bethnal Green re-appointed their Delegates, with instructions to consider and advise as to the best method of opposing the Nightingale Lane Tunnel Scheme in Parliament. Meetings were held, and as a result, letters were addressed to the Hackney District Board and to the Vestry of Bethnal Green, urging them to join with this Board in a combined opposition to the scheme, and also to the "Whitechapel and Poplar District Boards and the Vestries of Mile End Old Town, and St. George in-the-East, pointing out the advantages which would accrue from such combined opposition, and the expediency of their taking part in the same. The Poplar District Board, and the Vestry of Mile End Old Town, decided to be separately represented before the Committee of the House of Commons, to which the Bill, introduced by the Metropolitan Board for obtaining power to construct the Tunnel had been referred, and the Hackney District Board, and the Bethnal Green Vestry, postponed their decision until the settlement of the question of the legality of their incurring any expanse in connection with the opposition. This was the position of affairs at Lady-Day, 188-1, the time to which this Report extends. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, CHARLES DUNCH, Surveyor of the Board. 5338 BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. REPORT of the MEDIC A L OFFICER of HEALTH for the year 1883.

Of the births 1,301 were registered in Limehouse, 490 in Ratcliff, and 362 in Shadwell and tapping, giving an annual birth rate to these parishes of 40, 30 and 35 per 1,000 respectively. Of the deaths 727 were of males and 665 of females ; 670 were registered in Limehouse, 259 in Ratcliff, and 463 in Shadwell and Wapping, giving an annual death rate of 21, 16 and 44 per 1,000 to these parishes respectively, but, inasmuch, as the East London Children's Hospital wherein 161 deaths of persons resident outside the District, and 33 of persons resident in Limehouse and Ratcliff were registered, is situated in Shadwell, a deduction of these 194 deaths must be made. This will reduce the number of deaths in Shadwell and Wapping to 269, and give a 2 death rate to these parishes of 25 per 1,000. To estimate the deaths in the District we must deduct the 161 deaths, above alluded to, from the 1,392 deaths registered and add to the remainder our share of deaths which occurred in the I publice Institutions of London. That number this year amount to 147. Therefore we have 1,392 — 161 = 12 31 * 247 = 1,478, which represents the total mortality of your district for the year 1883. The Births and Marriages were below the average of the last ten years, while the deaths exactly coincided with that average. The Birth rate was 38 per 1,000, and the Death rate 25 per 1,000. The Birth rate of London was 33.9, and the Death rate 20 4 per 1,000. Twenty-five per cent, of the total deaths were those of children under 1 year, and 40 per cent, of the total deaths were those of children under 5 years of age. The Seven principal Zymotic Diseases caused a mortality of 254, a number equivalent to 4 3 per 1,000 of population. Pulmonary Diseases (other than Phthisis), caused 277 deaths which indicates a death rate of 17 per 1,000. Tubercular Diseases, such as Phthisis, Scrofula and Tabes, destroyed 152 lives and gave a death-rate of 2.6 per 1,000 population. Wasting Diseases of Infants, such as Marasmus, Atrophy and Debility, caused 117 deaths; a number which indicates a death rate of 2 per 1,000 population. Convulsive Diseases of Infants caused a mortality of 127, corresponding to a death rate of 2 1 per 1,000 population. 3 smallpox.—Six deaths occurred from this disease, all of them in Hospital. During the year only 22 cases caine to my knowledge against 8G in 1882. Measles,—Fifty-seven deaths were registered from this disease which caused a greater mortality than in any year since 1877, when the deaths numbered 71. Starlet Fever.—Eighty-four deaths were registered therefrom, 74 in the District and 10 in the Hospitals. One-hundred and eighty-two cases were reported to me against 190 in the preceding year. Diphtheria caused 18 deaths, a number considerably above any one of the last ten years. WHOOPING Cough contributed 30 deaths, a number considerably below the average of the last ten years. Fever caused 14 deaths. Thirty-eight cases came to my knowledge of which 36 were Enteric and 2 Typhus. DlARRHCEA.—To this cause 45 deaths were attributed, a number considerably below the average of the last ten years. Diseases of a Zymotic Character caused 279 deaths. Constitutional Diseases as Cancer, Tabes and Phthisis, caused 188 deaths. Local Diseases as Cephalitis, Apoplexy, Convulsions, Heart Disease, Bronchitis and Pneumonia caused 5132 deaths. Developmental Diseases caused 124 deaths. To Violence 78 deaths were attributed. 4 Sanitary Work, &c. For a detailed account of the routine Sanitary work performed during the year, see Table VI. The Manure Works of Messrs. Schofield and White, in St. Paul's Road, were again the subject of complaint on the part of the School Board Officers. The premises were frequently under inspection and it was found that a great deal of the nuisance complained of arose from the dust produced in the manipulation of the "sugar scum." It was therefore thought that if the premises were more efficiently enclosed and the roof pointed that the nuisance would be abated. I therefore suggested these alterations which Messrs. Schofield and White have carried into effect, and 1 have reason to believe that the nuisance has in consequence been abated. The Sewer Ventilators were a constant source of complaint in the District. The Surveyor of the Poplar Board of Works having paid much attention to the ventilation of the sewers and having devised a system for their more efficient ventilation, it was decided by the Board to permit the application of the system to three of the most offensive ventilators in the District. The localities chosen were The Triangle, Limehouse, Locksley Street, and Ratcliff Cross, and in these places the invention is now under trial. the Limehouse or Lea Cut was frequently the subject of observation. Sewage matter which was formerly discharged into the Cut lias tor some time been diverted, but the water way, notwithstanding, is at times very offensive. This arises, in my opinion, 5 principally from two causes, 1st, the impurity of the water admitted to the Cut, and 2nd, the pollution of the Cut by the dust yards on its banks. The condition of the supplying source should be improved, and no refuse matter from the dust yards or elsewhere should be permitted to find its way into the Cut, which should be periodically dredged, not as is the practice in the hot weather when the offensive effluvium compels the adoption of some steps for its alleviation, but in the cool seasons of the year. The sausage case factory in Rich Street, Limehouse, and the blood manure works on Bow Common, were subjects of complaint. These businesses were established before the passing of the Slaughter-houses Act of 1874, and are subject to the bye-laws made by the Metropolitan Board of Works for their c6nduct. Your Hoard have powers with regard to such businesses under the Nuisances Removal Act which were exercised in both cases. The outbreak of Cholera in Egypt caused great activity among the sanitary authorities of the Kingdom. It was recognized on all hands that the possibility of the importation of the disease into this country was by no means improbable and we proceeded to set our house in order. A general cleansing was instituted, our water receptacles, dust bins, courts and alleys were specially inspected and cleansed, and an Assistant Inspector was appointed to look after such matters. The contractors were especial objects of solicitude for it was felt that the accumulation of refuse in their yards was a menace to the public health and a source of danger, the magnitude of which, in the event of the introduction of Cholera, it was impossible to over estimate. Fortunately the disease did not appear, but the possibility of its advent produced its effect among the populace and the sanitary authorities for it served to direct attention where attention was needed, and to discover and remedy many sanitary evils. 1 am strongly of opinion that the Cholera in 6 Egypt last year did good work in this country by drawing such attention to sanitary matters as to give a great impetus to sanitation generally which will bear good fruit in the future. Elizabeth Court, Brook Street, is a locality which has often received consideration at your hands. It appeared to me, however, that it had arrived at a point past patching up, and I accordingly made my Report to your Board on the Court, under the provisions of Torrens's Acts, with a view to procuring the demolition of the property. The Surveyor, after inspection, confirmed my Report, but in consequence of the clause in the Act, which gives power to the owner to require the sanitary authority to purchase the condemned property, your Hoard decided to proceed under the Nuisances Removal Act, and ask the magistrate to close the houses. This was done. The magistrate's order was obtained and the houses were closed. In October I made a representation to the Metropolitan Hoard under the provisions of the Artisans and Labourers Dwelling' Acts, 1875, regarding an unsanitary area in Shadwell. The area in question is bounded on the north by the houses in Cable Street, on the south by houses in High Street, Shadwell, on the west by Victoria Street, and on the east by Albert Street. It comprises Baroda Place, Hastings Place, Chancery Court, Chancery Place, Angel Gardens, Angel Court, Fortunate Place, Chapel Place and V ictoria Place. Many of the houses are built back to back, most of them are in a bad structural state, and the death rate for the last three years averaged 44 per 1,000 per annum. The locality has been inspected and reported on more frequently than any other single locality in your District, and the work of patching up has been going on there, more or less constantly, for years past. It therefore appeared to me to be a fit area to proceed upon under the above named Act. 7 By the Factory and Workshop Act, 1883, the sanitary control of Bakehouses has been re-transferred to the local authorities. I have consequently made arrangements for the regular inspection of such premises, a list of which appears among the tables in the Appendix. The common lodging house, No. 3, Medland Street, came under ray notice in consequence of an outbreak of Smallpox among the inmates. Milder measures for dislodging the disease having failed, I was compelled to advise the closing of the house for one month. The premises and effects received a thorough disinfection and the disease was eradicated. The Metropolitan Board having passed a resolution not to deal with the Nightingale Lane area, I reported the locality to your Board under the provisions of Torrens's Acts, but for the same reason as operated in the case of Elizabeth Court, Brook Street, your Board ordered proceedings to be taken with regard to the area under the Nuisances Removal Act. Your instructions were carried out and the houses dealt with, a few at a time. At first this plan of dealing with the property promised well; the magistrate made an order to close the first houses proceeded against until rendered habitable, and they were ultimately pulled down, a fate deserved by the rest. In the case of the remaining houses, however, he merely made orders to remedy the various sanitary defects within a stated time, and with that, I suppose, we must be satisfied for the present. Cow and Slaughter Houses. These structures were again licensed after conforming with the requirements of your Board. A list of licensees, with addresses, is contained in the Appendix. 8 Sale of Food and Drugs' Act. Eighty-seven samples of Food and Drugs were examined at the Board's Laboratory. Of these 8 were Coffees, of which I was adulterated with 35 per cent. of chicory. Seventeen were Milks, of which 3 were adulterated with varying proportions of water. Eight were Butters, of which 1 consisted almost entirely of foreign fat. Twelve were Gins, of which 1 was watered beyond the extent allowed by law. Four were Cocoas, of which 2 were adulterated with starch and sugar. The remaining samples consisting of Bread, Pepper, Arrowroot, Tincture of Orange, Tincture of Ginger. Flour, Whisky, Tincture of Rhubarb, and Mustard, were genuine. I have much pleasure in stating that the Inspectors have carried out my instructions and performed their duties to my entire satisfaction. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, G. A. ROGERS, Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst. Board's Offices:— White Horse Street. July, 1884. 9 TABLE I.
