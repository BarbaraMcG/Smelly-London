Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year 1961, which is compiled in accordance with Ministry Circular No. 1/62. Among the vital statistics it will be noted that the birth rate has risen and is above the national average, while the death rate has fallen and is below that of the rest of the country. Unfortunately the stillbirth rate and the infantile mortality rate are both higher than the national average. The death rate from cancer compares favourably with other parts of the country, but nevertheless, twelve men died from cancer of the lung. It is fresh in everyone's mind that the Report of the Royal College of Physicians on Smoking and Lung Cancer proved very conclusively the connection between lung cancer and cigarette smoking. It is not going to be an easy task to educate people to adopt other forms of smoking if they are unprepared to give it up altogether. At least we can start by trying to teach the young of the risks to health from the cigarette habit and in this parents and teachers can co-operate while effective steps are taken by the various authorities to see that the law against supplying cigarettes to young people under 16 is strictly enforced. There was a fairly large outbreak of measles during the year, but the disease was a mild type on the whole. I am glad to report for the fourteenth year in succession no case of diphtheria occurred. Immunisation has been offered through the Kent County Council and general practitioners against Diphtheria, Whooping Cough and Tetanus, and vaccination against Smallpox and Poliomyelitis. These have been taken advantage of by a considerable number of parents for their children, but there are still too many who hold back for various reasons. The department has been very fully occupied with slum clearance and the Clean Air Act, and a considerable amount of time has been given by your inspectors at week-ends and in the evenings dealing with the various problems that have arisen. We are now beginning to see the results of our slum clearance programme in the Groves Development Area where the tower blocks are beginning to rise above the houses they will eventually replace. The first smokeless area comes into force in September. 4 Once again it gives me great pleasure in acknowledging the valuable work done by the various voluntary organisations in helping in many ways both the old, the sick and the needy of the district, and I am very glad that under recent legislation it should be possible for local authorities to assist them in this work. In conclusion, I would like to express my thanks to Mr. E. G. Thomas, Chief Public Health Inspector, and the members of the Staff of the department for their willing help and co-operation at all times. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (Acres) 770 Population (Census 1931) 27,771 Population (Census 1951) 25,012 Home Population, Mid-year 1961 (estimated by Registrar-General) 25,830 Rateable Value, 1st April, 1961 £358,811 Sum represented by 1d. rate £1,442 The district, situated on the north-west border of Kent, and immediately adjoining the Counties of London and Surrey, is on the slope of a hill, the highest point being 370 feet above sea level and the lowest 95 feet above sea level. The density of population per acre is 33, this being by far the highest in the County of Kent. This results in there being very few open spaces in the district, the largest one being the grounds of the Old Crystal Palace the majority of which are in this area. This density of building has caused a shortage of space for school playing fields for the schools of the district and pupils mainly have to go outside the area for games. The Manager of the Employment Exchange for the area informs me that there were 86 men and 16 women in the Penge area registered as unemployed at the end of the year. VITAL STATISTICS Live births 596 Live birth rate per 1,000 population 23.07 Stillbirths 12 Stillbirth rate per 1,000 live and still births 19.7 Total live and still births 608 Total infant deaths 14 Infant mortality rates (1) Total infant deaths per 1,000 live births 23.5 (2) Total infant deaths per 1,000 legitimate live births 25.4 (3) Total infant deaths per 1,000 illegitimate live births 28.0 Neo-natal mortality rate per 1,000 live births 20.0 Early neo-natal mortality rate per 1,000 live births 18.4 Peri-natal mortality rate per 1,000 live and still births 54.2 Illegitimate live births per cent of the total live births 8.4 Maternal deaths (including abortion) Nil 5 Births The live births registered during the year numbered 596 compared with 560 in 1960. This gives a crude birth rate of 23.07 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 21.7 for 1960. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar-General for the purpose of securing comparability between local births is 0.91. This makes the Adjusted Birth Rate 21.0 compared with 19.6 for 1960. Stillbirths The number of stillbirths registered was 12, equal to a rate of 19.7 of 1,000 total births, compared with 32.8 for 1960. Deaths The deaths registered totalled 281, equal to a crude death rate for the year of 10.8 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 11.4 for 1960. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar-General for the purpose of securing comparability between local death rates is 0.97. This makes the Adjusted Death Rate 10.5 compared with 11.3 for the year 1960. The death rate for England and Wales was 12.0 compared with 11.5 recorded for 1960. Deaths among the inmates of an institution for men numbered 8. A large proportion of deaths was of elderly people, and of the total deaths 196 or 69.7% were of persons 65 years of age and over compared with 69.5% the previous year. Those dying at 75 years of age and over accounted for 44.1% of the deaths compared with 40.3% for 1960. Cancer Deaths from cancer numbered 44 giving a death rate for Home Population of 1.7 compared with 2.2 for 1960. The rate for England and Wales was 2.16. Twelve males died of cancer of the lungs. Tuberculosis There were two deaths from tuberculosis in Penge, giving a death rate of .07. The rate for England and Wales was .072. Maternal Mortality There were no maternal deaths during the year. The rate for England and Wales was 0.33 compared with 0.39 for 1960. 6 Infantile Mortality The number of deaths under one year was 14, corresponding to a rate of 23.5 1,000 births, compared with rate of 16.07 for 1960. The infantile mortality rate for England and Wales was 21.4. Eleven of these infants died under one week and there were three deaths from congenital malformations. Comparative Vital Statistics The following table shows the comparative figures for 1961:— Rate per 1,000 Home Population Rate per 1,000 total births Death Rate per 1,000 Total Population Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 live Births Live Births Still Births Penge Urban District 23.07 19.7 10.8 23.5 England and Wales 17.4 18.7 12.0 21.4 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE AREA Water Supply The water supply of the area has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity, all the houses in the area being provided with a constant service of water by the Metropolitan Water Board.

CANAL, BETTS PARK As in previous years the water in this canal has, from time to time, caused anxiety, arising from decomposing vegetable matter, together with material thrown therein and also the breeding of insects. The water was twice subject to chemical treatment during the summer months to prevent the breeding of insects therein. 21 prevention of damage by pests act, 1949 Complaints numbering 182 regarding rats and 92 mice were received from all parts of the district and investigated. No major rat infestations were found. It was found that defective drains and sewers were frequently associated with rat infestations and also that the keeping of animals contributed to the number of rat infestations. As in previous years the foul water sewers were treated on two occasions. In April 137 manholes and side entrances were baited and takes recorded in 25. The figures for the October treatment were 156 manholes baited and takes recorded in 22. One full-time rodent operative is employed and the following is a summary of work carried out by him at premises in the district:— Inspections and re-inspections made 2,100 Premises treated for rats 357 Premises where rat poison bait taken 156 Premises treated for mice 107 Premises re-treated for mice 37 Number of "block controls" carried out 108 common lodging houses There are three Common Lodging Houses within the district which take in male lodgers. The management of these has been in the hands of the same family for very many years. The premises are well managed, but the properties are old, and suffer from structural defects. They are within a proposed clearance area, and it is anticipated that they will be subject to clearance within the next few years. movable dwellings The camping and caravan site of nearly three acres in the Crystal Palace Grounds, established in 1951 and run by the Caravan Club of Great Britain, continues to be occupied.
