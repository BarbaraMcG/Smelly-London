Your Board, pursuant to the provisions of the Act 18 & 19 Vict., cap. 120> sec. 198, report in brief their proceedings during the year ending 25 th of March, 1866. The number of nuisance cases removed during the year, is: Privies and Cesspools emptied 362 Drains and Gullies cleansed and repaired 513 Houses ditto ditto 439 Swine Nuisances removed 207 Miscellaneous 119 Total 1640 Houses benefited in Fulham 784 „ „ Hammersmith 944 Total 1728 Your Board report that they have effected a great public improvement at the Potteries, Fulham, at a cost of £450 for the land, towards which they have received a contribution from the Metropolitan Board of Works of £150, and a further contribution from certain inhabitants of that parish, amounting to £65. Theyhave also arranged for carrying out an important improvement in Broadway, Hammersmith, at a cost of £413 for the site; this being on a main line of Metropolitan thoroughfare, they hope to receive a contribution of the whole amount thereof from the Metropolitan Board. Since presenting their last report they have to record the completion of Sewers as follows, all of which are in active operation, viz:— Brook Green Sewer, from the ShepherdV Bush Road, to the High Road at Mr. Hurst's corner, and Masboro' Road, North Sewer; King Street East Sewer, from the Broadway to the point of junction with the Brook Green Sewer at Mr. Hurst's corner; Walham Green Sewer, from North End, to Walham Green; Sun Street Sewer; Parson's Green Lane, and Peterboro' Lane Sewers. They have also to state that they have taken up the balance of loan (£19,000) from the Royal Exchange Corporation. Copies of the mortgages thereon are presented herewith. 6 Your Board having frequently urged upon the Metropolitan Board c Works the necessity of completing their proposed Drainage Works for thi district, viz: the outlet at Sand's End, the construction of the Fulhar Town Sewer, the Stamford Brook Diversion, and the Grove Sewers fo Hammersmith—they are happy to state that that Board have now resolvei to do such works forthwith, and are actively progressing with the Stamfon Brook Diversion Sewer. The Sewers yet requiring (according to the Surveyor's schedule) to be constructed by your Board, are: King's Road Sewer, Fulham; New Road, Masboro' Road North, Waterloo Street, Beavo Lane, and the Sewer from Queen Street to Parr's Bridge. Your Board have had under most anxious consideration, the state or the open ditches and sewers abounding in the district, to remedy which they are preparing plans, which it is their intention to carry out or enforce so soon as the several outlets are provided. With respect to the nuisance so publicly complained of, viz., the open stagnant ditch, in the rear of Lord Ravensworth's property, they have already carried out works of a remedial character. They have in answer to a numerously signed memorial, laid down several pitched crossings at Walham Green, effecting a great improvement in that important line of thoroughfare. Through the breaking up of the most important roads of the district to carry out the foregoing works, much inconvenience and increased expense have been occasioned to the ratepayers, but your Board hope that as those roads become consolidated, the inconvenience will be done away with, and the cost of management diminished. Your Board have ordered to be published herewith an Abstract of Accounts, a Statement of Assets and Liabilities, together with the Auditors' Certificate; also a list of Contracts entered into during the year, and the 10th Annual Report of their Medical Officer of Health, on the Sanitary Condition of the District.

TENTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Board of Works, Fulham District. GENTLEMEN, of a census of the population of the Fulham District could be taken at moment, I believe we should find that a very large accession to our numaas taken place, of all, but especially of the working classes, and yet ire much to congratulate ourselves upon in taking a review of our lry condition. I have, however, in my previous reports dwelt on the or of lulling ourselves into an arrogant feeling of safety, for I believe at riod have we had more anxious reason to be watchfully vigilant and ml than now. Many are the social conditions actively disturbing the nation of large masses of the working people, and we know not what;ring influences may yet be developed from this circumstance. The tide of epidemic disease, occasionally also, as we too well know, is apt underflow its ordinary limits, and this too sometimes from causes over which ve no direct control. Neither do we know with certainty the exact laws * govern the course of such mysterious enemies as Asiatic Cholera, * is we do know, that wherever they may fix themselves, the laws which tr their developement are so plain and evident that those who run may atand that wherever those known conditions are neglected or carelessly fcnreted, there widespread mischief assuredly results. During the past year mtinent of Europe has been visited in many parts with Cholera, and cases sporadic character appeared in England. Its embers have scarcely yet Jout in many parts with which this country has constant communication dt behoves us ever to be on the alert to meet so dire a scourge. The it outbreak of undoubted Cholera at Liverpool, amongst the German Wants, is a portentous circumstance,and shows how, at any moment, now utile epidemic influence is setting Westward, we may have to contend with nrer home. The public themselves, apart from official interference, have to do with mitigating the blow. All classes should be warned of the qit necessity for personal cleanliness, for the avoidance of over crowding, for vee ventilation of their living and sleeping rooms, and above all the prompt toral of all excrementitious matter from them. I am firmly of opinion attention to this point is of most special importance, aud cannot be too ipmsly insisted on. The greatest activity should prevail also in the pubpartment through the ensuing summer. The work of the scavenger d be carried out with regularity and energy; the removal of domestic should take place more frequently than under ordinary circumstances, he cleansing of our streets and public thoroughlfares must be vigorously 12 executed. The free use of disinfectants should be had recourse to in the i lie sewers as well as in private drains, those most to be depended on Carbolic Acid and Condy's Fluid. The former is more applicable for the larger scale by public bodies, the latter more convenient for private The active operations of your Board have fortunately relieved the ham District to a large extent, from that pregnant source of mischief, w drainage, still there are large tracts of building land yet unprovided f much of which houses by dozens are being squatted without any regard the great essential by the builders, save the horrid cesspool system. It is en to have to counteract the evils of past imprudence without perpetuating by such wilful recklessness. Knowing that your Board have seriously resolved further to exterm sewerage of the district, it is almost needless to refer to it here, but it in possible to overrate the importance in a sanitary point of view, of the pr accomplishment of the intended works. In pointing out some places within district requiring further drainage my remarks apply to the sanitary neut ties, and must be received with proper deference to the Surveyor's vi whilst it is not within my province to enter on the financial difficulties well may attend the prosecution of the suggested sewers. In Hammersmith Bradmore, the seat of cholera in its former visitations, may not inappropriate be mentioned first. Here many houses yet depend on the cesspool system The Western side of St Peter's Square, Beavor Lane, and Hog Lane, have efficient sewerage, and the houses in Bridge Street, ranging on the Creek, pour their filthy sewage into that open receptacle, carrying the risk of pestiitf in its wake. Waterloo Street and South Street, with their contiguous thorci fares demand attention also on the score of drainage, for though not absolclt without, the present means are very inefficient, and the principal outlets gape upon the eastern bank of the pestiferous Creek. Shortlands again strong sanitary grounds for an improvement of its drainage. Nothing cesspools at present exist or the most inefficient pipe drainage into the ditch drain in King Street East, though probably this may now be conna with the new sewer; the pipes however from the houses where they e must still be on nearly a dead level. This locality is always a fruitful on sickness, as the books of the Union Officers show. From the Wooden Brfl eastward, along the Mall to the Chancellor's Estate, the sewage of the hoi south of the intercepting sewer continue to pour their contents into the rii The sewers and drains here, both public and private, require to be rever and connected with the intercepting line. The Fulham Road Sewer, thought I believe ordered, has not been begun. Brook Green Place, alias " Rookery," a frequent source of sickness, has very inefficient sewerage, who requires to be deepened. The open ditch in Wood Lane is generally in a most offensive condition and should be promptly deepened and covered in. The cesspools of some the new houses in Farm Lane are already overflowing; a deep public sever here, between the Gold Hawk and Albion Roads is becoming absolutely cessary. In Fulham much more extensive areas are as yet entirely unprovided for. The lines of sewers already executed run only through the lead thoroughfares, leaving many thickly populated localities to cesspool drainge and many of the parish roads in a state of swamp in heavy rains. 13 rotn Walham Green to Fulham Town by Percy Cross, no main exists. Between Crown Road and Dawe's Lane, and immediately in ighbourhood of St. Thomas' Church, a very large number of houses s, till remain undrained unless a public sewer of ample size be built between Kooints, forming a junction with the intercepting line in Dawe's Lane. ishop's Road, from the Mitre Tavern southward, is almost always in a of nuisance from want of drainage. The construction of a deep pipe vtinthis road, from the Mitre to Wheatsheaf Alley, would prove a public act, and at the same time give facility for enforcing an improvement in operty there, which has so long been a centre of abominations. arm Lane, at Walham Green, is lined with property on either side still divided for, and the public road is constantly in a state of nuisance inns to health in such a crowded neighbourhood. The construction of a here is a great and increasing public necessity. The public thoroughfare, Star Lane, is also a public opprobrium for want pper drainage, and immediate measures are required to drain it into tr End Sewer. The drainage in the rear of Vale Place, North End, both te thoroughfares and in the houses, is superficial and inefficient and Bids attention, whilst that of Vernon Street, Munden Street, &c., requires t reversed and entirely shut off from the Black Bull ditch. The Greytl ditch, though last to be referred to, is a nuisance at present of the test magnitude, so glaring indeed, and so pernicious to the public health, at almost any sacrifice, it should at once be obliterated from our map. The Sanitary Committee have been much engaged during the past year orcing house drainage into those deep sewers recently constructed, and e number of proceedings are still pending to the like purpose. The aton of your officers has been actively directed to the cleansing and improvei of the cottage property, but the dilapidated condition of some, the Verence of a few refractory landlords, the filthy habits of many of the ts, and the weakness of the law to enforce substantial repairs render it stantly recurring labour and anxiety. Still, amidst all the negligence disk arising from these causes, I am happy to report that no large amount kness has prevailed in the Fulham District during 1865. This is an imty however we have no right to calculate upon in future. A serious int of overcrowding will ensue within our limits unless the tide of imigation be diverted, or further house accommodation with proper sanitary ft reraents be provided. The demand for labour has been great, and thus:quent source of misery and sickness has been spared us. Amongst the otic diseases which have prevailed, Ilooping-cough and Diarrhoea have most prominent. Small Pox has also lingered amongst us, and although wncentration of the disease in any special spot occurred, still many cases ihave been reported to me. The prompt removal of infected persons from wiore crowded neighbourhoods has contributed largely to a prevention of read, still the recent progressive prevalence of this disease is a cause for i anxiety, and shows some radical defect with reference to Vaccination. are two points of view from which the subject may be considered. I.—lias the Vaccine Virus lost its influence ? II.—Is Vaccination efficiently conducted ? ** arc questions in which not only the medical profession but the public 14 also arc most seriously concerned,and the attention of the government sin be urgently drawn to them by local sanitary authorities, with a view to t solution. If the former be proved, then some special means should be ado for its general revival from the cow, for none can doubt the extended ben to mankind of the discovery of Jenner; if the latter, it should induce' adoption of a more perfect code of Vaccination laws, and the enforcement it more careful performance of the operation itself. The total mortality of the Fulham District in 1865 has been 1195. It first three months of the year were unusually cold, and following the geni death rate of London, the deaths in the Fulham District were according numerous, viz., 115, 104, & 116 respectively, whilst the influence of the it season was evident through the month of April, when 116 were also record. The temperature gradually rose to July, when it was excessive, and summer Diarrhoea began to tell upon the health of the people; 117 deaths occur this month, but notwithstanding the occasional recurrence of hot days September the number of deaths gradually declined until December, in which month the number rose again to 111; of these, the diseases of a Zymotic character only contributed 16. The mortality from this latter class throughout year has been of Small Pox 13, Measles 41, Scarlatina 38, Hooping-coi 46, Diarrhoea 79, Kever (Continued, Typhus and Typhoid) 27, Cholera 2,. Diptheritis, 8. Infant mortality again bears its usual lamentable proportion to general death rate, 544 (or upwards of 45 per ccnt.) were deaths recorded children who had not attained their 5th year of age, and 307 of these di before they were one. year old. In estimating the mortality of the Fulham District in reference to the general death rate through the kingdom, it be remembered that in the parish of Hammersmith several eleemosynary i stitutions, under Woman Catholic supervision exist, and out of the 722 deaths that parish, no less than 73, or nearly one-tenth part, occurred in them, these 73 deaths also, 63 took place in Nazareth House, and on further anal zing the returns from this institution we find that 32, or about 50 per cent. were of children not exceeding 2 years of age. It cannot be supposed the these inmates were the natural residents of Hammersmith, but it may be ferred that they have sought or found shelter here from various other part the fact however still remains that our mortality is swelled to that extended An examination of the Union house mortality shows a different result, for the 59 deaths occurring there only 6 were under 2 years of age, whilst were 60 years and upwards. A special feature also in the mortality often year has been an extraordinary fatality amongst parturient women, no to than 13 having succumbed to the various circumstances connected ft child-birth, the months of September and November each contributing There have been no apparent special conditions, atmospheric, or otherwise to account for it, but the fact is worth recording. 13 deaths have occurred the West London Hospital; 58 in the Union House; 14 in Lunatic Asyta and 11 in various Almshouses. 61 inquests have been recorded in the Registrars' returns. Phthisis has this year numbered 122 victims. The mortality of the year includes the deaths of 181 persons who has attained the age of 70 years and upwards; 55 of these had reached to 8 years and upwards, 10 to 90 years and upwards, and 2 had even passed 15 ry, both widows, dying in the Union House, the elder being 101 years. The number of births registered in the year have been 1GG3, showing an sos of births over deaths of 468. The question of water supply still anxiously engages my attention. No remains have been laid down by the water companies, neither has any action taken place in the sanitary law on the question of water supply for uistic purposes. During the drought of last summer many of the poorer ftloitants suffered much from want of water, and should Cholera or other iis epidemic visit us, it is fearful to contemplate how much it would be vated by this deficiency. As the deep sewers become further available Committee will, I have no doubt, continue to enforce house drainage them, with water supply to privies, but there are many places where both uage and water are altogether absent. The difficulty of getting a urable magisterial decision under the 67th section of the Metropolis Local oigement Act, has been a source of much embarrasment to your officers, it think it will be desirable in future that your Board shall carry out the oi yourselves where necessary, under the powers given you in that clause. The results of a noble act of philanthropy are now shewing themselves gh several parts of London. Can any share of this be made available le working classes of the Fulham District.? The admirable report of;-j Peabody Committee just published, gives fresh life to my hopes, msonie public effort may be yet made to ameliorate the condition e industrious poor around us. The tide of immigration conrns to fill our tenements with a dangerous overcrowding, and pestijn, sooner or later, will consequently take its hold among their iflpants. The remedy is available, will no body take the part of the irician ? The report referred to shows that many thousands of pounds lis munificent gift yet remain to be appropriated, and surely our Bet can with justice seek some of the heavenlike benefits to be conferred, it work of demolition has indeed begun amongst ourselves, and recently a p of cottage property, too bad for habitation, has been levelled to the Aid under order from the magistrate, whilst others must of necessity soon a similar fate. 1 know that your Board in their corporate capacity, A no power to use the funds at your disposal for purposes of this nature, re you charged with the duty of providing house accommodation for the Jon, but it is through my Annual Report to you, that this subject may be trtght before the public, and gain force by the measure of approbation acLd to it by your body. The London Labourers' Dwelling Society are also is moment seeking further sites for the extension of their admirable nations, but they require a certain amount of local assistance in carrying iheir scheme. The occurrence of the Cattle Plague in England is, unfortunately, too diar with all to require comment. The Fulham district was not exempted its ravages, but although some of the largest cow-keepers suffered frely by it, 1 am happy to say we enjoyed a greater immunity from the se than almost any other London district; this I believe to be attriiblo to a great extent, to the activc precautions taken by the cow-keepers i e matter on its outbreak, and by the vigilance and care in avoiding all cs ot infection. Many valuable cows have consequently been spared to ud the owners from an irreparable loss. 16 A largo amount of disease has also for a considerable time prevent amongst swine, and this has tended, together with the enforcement of sanitary requirements, greatly to reduco the number of pigs kept in the district; i consider a most desirable result for the inhabitants in general, who have, in i spots, suffered great annoyance from tho piggeries, and from the practic. boiling offensive ofTiil for their food. The time has indeed fully nrit when these offensive establishments within the Metropolitan area shoulu, entirely abolished. Thus then, Gentlemen, I have endeavoured briefly to lay before you Kanitury features of the year just past, respecting the Fulham District, i details of the works carried out under tho orders of your Sanitary Commit will be found in the two Inspectors'reports to your Hoard. Many diflicul have been overcome, and many yet will have to be surmounted. Tho rap with which our population increases will call for increased energy in j sanitary officers, but tho generous support of your Hoard will sweeten labour. METEOROLOGY.
