In accordance with my statutory duty as your Medical Officer of Health I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year 1961. This report is prepared according to the Ministry of Health circular 1/62 and preceding relevant circulars. VITAL STATISTICS: Population: The preliminary report on the Census 1961 shows that we had a population of 69,311 persons, a decrease of 680 persons or 1% since the Census of 1951 when the population was 69,991. In 1961 the population was housed in 21,320 houses, flats or other commercial properties with living accommodation, whereas in 1951 the number of dwellings was 19,664. It is therefore pleasing to note that the occupancy per dwelling has been reduced from 3.56 persons to 3.25 persons. This, of course, does not mean that statutory overcrowding has been eliminated. Death Rate: The death rate of 12.3 was higher than that of 1960 which was 10.7 or 847 deaths as against 738 deaths in 1960, an increase of 109; 82 of these additional deaths occurred in the age group 65 years and upwards. The major causes of death were first, diseases of the heart and blood vessels and second, cancer of various types. Cancer of the lung caused 39 deaths as compared to 38 deaths in 1960; 19 of these occurred in the middle age group, i.e., between the ages of 45 and 65 years. I would again draw attention to the dangers of cigarette smoking and its close relation to lung cancer. Many of us can recall the dread and fear engendered by Tuberculosis not so very long ago but a glance at the graph on page 25 should indicate that death from cancer of the lung is now more than three times more common than death from respiratory tuberculosis. I am pleased to report again that as in 1960 there were no maternal deaths; this is a tribute to our doctors, midwives and health visitors, both in hospitals and on the district. Birth Rate: A total of 989 babies were born in Finchley in 1961 compared to 1,052 last year. A birth rate of 13.8 compared to a national average of 17.4. Infant Mortality Rate : Twenty-three infants under the age of one year died giving a rate of 23.3, i.e., 5 23.3 deaths per thousand live births. Nineteen of these deaths occurred in the first week of life. Two children died from congenital deformities but it has not been possible to find out whether the drug thalidomide was involved. From conversations with consultant obstetricians and doctors in the area in and around Finchley I gather that thalidomide was little prescribed and I am hopeful that Finchley has escaped lightly. COMMUNICABLE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Apart from the expected epidemic of measles the year 1961 was generally quiet. The advent of smallpox in London in December resulted in the Department being extremely busy, a situation which continued well into the new year. I am pleased to report once more that there were no cases of poliomyelitis or diphtheria. Dysentery was again mild following the national trend which showed a reduction of more than 50% in notified cases. Food Poisoning showed an unwelcome increase resulting in 21 cases, compared to 8 cases last year. Nevertheless our knowledge in regard to the spread of this condition is increasing, and strengthening the view that the major source of infection is raw meat and poultry which carries the organisms into our homes. Person to person spread did not appear to be a factor of any of the cases which occurred. This Department in conjunction with the Public Health Department of Hendon and the Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale produced some evidence in an investigation carried out over the past two years concerning pet animal foods and artificial fertilizers, a short summary of which appears on page 27. Details of the various illnesses met with during the year can be read under the appropriate headings in the body of the report. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES: Perhaps the outstanding feature of the year has to be the advent of Clean Air Areas in the southern part of the Borough. Smoke Control Orders governing these Areas came into operation in September, 1961. Visually the effect of these Areas is remarkable. The roof of the eleven storey block at Prospect Ring, East Finchley, forms a useful vantage point for observation and I can only state that the difference between looking north and looking south over the Clean Air Areas is most striking, the only spoiling factor being the odd garden bonfire. Details of these Smoke Control Areas and future plans are to be found later in this report. GENERAL: Over the past few years I have commented on the services for the elderly in the Borough and I had hoped to be able to include accurate figures concerning the aged from the 1961 Census for this report but alas they are not yet available. Nevertheless it is obvious that despite the vast amount of effort put in by statutory workers and 6 voluntary bodies (here Finchley is twice blessed) in this field, consummation of these efforts is handicapped by the shortage of both geriatric hospital beds and places in Welfare Homes. CONCLUSION: This report could not be compiled without the help of the family doctors and my fellow Chief Officers in Finchley and I would also like to acknowledge the help of all those who have contributed to the information in the Report, both individuals and organisations. I would again draw attention to the loyalty and fidelity of the staff of this Department and finally my thanks to the Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee for their support and encouragement. I am, Your obedient servant, J. G. HAGAN, Medical Officer of Health. 7 Acknowledgments to:— The Chief Officers of the Council— The Town Clerk—R. M. Franklin, Esq. The Borough Engineer and Surveyor—P.

More manual workers are now settling in the district but again most of the skilled workers travel to the more industrialised areas of Wembley, Colindale, Wood Green, etc. The percentage of unemployed workers to the employed population is not known, but it is believed to be well below the national percentage. Unemployment usually reaches its lowest point in June of each year, normally rising again after Christmas and then starting to decrease in March. Figures for Finchley are not available, but the following table shows the number of unemployed adult persons, i.e., aged 18 and over, for the Finchley and Friern Barnet areas:- 1959 1960 1961 June December June December June December Men 176 173 142 151 102 182 Women 44 44 22 19 5 23 Total 220 217 164 170 107 205 On dates nearest to the end of the year on which a count was made of young persons under 18 years of age, there were 23 boys and 3 girls registered as unemployed, 143 unfilled vacancies for boys and 89 for girls. At Christmas 115 boys and 122 girls left school to enter employment. The year was notable for the large number of school leavers and the relative ease with which they obtained employment. In general they were absorbed into employment more easily than had been anticipated. Indeed the long-standing shortage of suitable juvenile labour in some occupations remained throughout the year. Once again, a large number of young people went outside the area for their jobs—either to neighbouring suburban areas or to Central London. Engineering attracted boys of a wide range of ability and of all age groups from 15 to 18 years. Building, electrical contracting, motor repair and servicing and the distributive trades appealed mainly to the 15-year-old leavers, and clerical work mainly to those leaving at 16 years or over. The distributive trades and hairdressing mainly attracted the 15-year-old girl leaver. Clerical work appealed particularly to girls leaving school at 16 and 17. ROAD SAFETY The following tables show the number of road traffic accidents and casualties within the Borough during 1961 and comparative figures for the past five years. The figures supplied by the Registrar-General, shown in the list of causes of 19 death on page 14, refer to Finchley residents only regardless of place of death, and therefore may not agree with the number of fatalities shown below.

During the year, the following immunisations were carried out:- By General Practitioners By Medical Officers of the Local Authority Number of Children Diphtheria only 18 10 Tetanus only 12 60 Diphtheria and Tetanus Primary 17 45 Diptheria and Tetanus Booster 52 2 Triple Primary 438 362 Triple Booster 124 3 In addition, 45 children were immunised by General Practitioners and 8 by Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority, with a combined diphtheria and whooping cough prophylactic. One thousand one hundred and six children were given "booster" doses of diphtheria prophylactic alone and 59 were given "booster" doses of combined diphtheria and whooping cough prophylactic. Scarlet Fever There were 18 cases of Scarlet Fever, one less than in the previous year. The known cases were mild in character and there is little doubt that in a number of others the illness was so slight as to escape detection altogether. There were no deaths. Poliomyelitis No case of Poliomyelitis occurred during the year. Early in 1960 it was decided to extend poliomyelitis vaccination to persons under the age of 40. Hitherto vaccination could only be obtained by persons under the age of 26 and certain special groups such as Health Visitors and Public Health Inspectors. In 1961 arrangements for poliomyelitis vaccination were extended to include a reinforcing fourth dose; Ministry of Health Circular No. 15/61 asked specifically for arrangements to be made to offer such a dose to children when they enter school (normally at the age of 5), to children of 5 and over already at school who have not reached the age of 12 and to all children of similar ages who are not attending school. 22 The number of persons vaccinated in Finchley during 1961 is shown as follows:- By General Practitioners By Middlesex County Council 1. with 3 injections:- (a) Born 1943-1961 549 336 (b) Born 1933-1942 286 125 (c) Born before 1933 and under 40 years 907 322 (d) Others 9 14 2. With 4 injections:- Children aged 5-12 years 1814 2037 Measles The number of notifications was 1,173 compared with 74 in 1960. This is the highest number of notifications recorded since the disease was made notifiable by the Regulations of 1939. There were no deaths. Whooping Cough The notifications numbered 11 in 1961 and there were no deaths. During the year, 8 children were immunised by General Practitioners and Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority. Pneumonia Only two forms of pneumonia, namely, acute primary and influenzal, are notifiable. Eight such cases were reported to me during the year. In the table of deaths, all forms of pneumonia are included in the classification (No. 23). It will be seen that 52 deaths occurred and of these 46 were persons of 65 years of age and over. Puerperal Pyrexia The total number of cases notified during the year was 25, all of which occurred at the North Middlesex Hospital Annexe in The Bishop's Avenue. Food Poisoning Seventeen persons were notified as suffering from food poisoning during the year, and in addition 4 cases were otherwise ascertained. The causative organism identified in ten of the cases was salmonella typhimurium and in one case cl. welchii. Dysentery Thirteen cases of dysentery were notified and all of these cases were visited, investigated and the persons concerned advised on how to prevent the spread of this infection. All cases were due to shigella sonnei. This bacillus one might say is rampant throughout the country and caused some 20,412 cases nationally in 1961. Fortunately it is a mild infection as a rule, although the illness can be severe in infants and in the aged. It tends to become epidemic in schools, hospitals, nurseries or camps. Its prevention is simple, i.e., the teaching of hand washing in schools and an improvement in the general standard of hygiene in the home. 23 Typhoid and Paratyphoid There were no cases of Typhoid or Paratyphoid during the year. VACCINATION AGAINST SMALLPOX The number of persons vaccinated for the first time by General Practitioners and Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority was nine hundred and nine. Three hundred and twelve were re-vaccinated. INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATES OF VACCINATION Persons travelling to certain foreign parts have to provide themselves with certificates of vaccination or inoculation which must have been completed by their own medical practitioners before proceeding. In several parts of the world certificates are not accepted unless they are endorsed by a medical officer in the Government or local authority of the country of issue. A form of authentication which has been accepted by the health authorities abroad is that given by public health authorities and identified by a rubber stamp impression placed by them on the certificate. The rubber stamp in this office bears the words "Finchley Corporation—Signature of doctor authenticated." The purpose of the authentication is to provide proof to those health authorities abroad who desire it that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. During the year 548 certificates were authenticated. TUBERCULOSIS One person died from tuberculosis during 1961, giving a death rate of 0.01 per 1,000 population. Thirty-three new cases were notified, seven more than in the previous year. The case rate per 1,000 population was 0.48. Two children under school age were found to be suffering from tuberculosis of the lungs. The following table shows the number of notifications and the number of deaths during the past 10 years:— Year New Cases Deaths Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M. F. M. F. M. F. m.

A joint report prepared during the latter half of the year was published in the "Lancet" on the 17th February, 1962, and I give below a brief summary of its contents. "In recent years many materials which are sold for pet foods or garden fertilizers have been shown to be contaminated with salmonella organisms. Galton et al. (1955) found that over 26 per cent. of samples of dehydrated dog meals contained salmonellae 27 and suggested that these might be a source of human infection. In 1957, Walker showed that 40 per cent. of samples of garden fertilizers were contaminated. Subsequently various fertilizers and animal feeding stuffs were found also to contain similar organisms (Reports 1959a and 1961). These included bone meal, hoof and horn meal, dried blood, meat meal and fish meal, all of which can be purchased in retail shops in this country. "A study of pet foods and garden fertilizers on sale in the boroughs of Finchley and Hendon is described in this paper and an attempt is made to assess the importance of these materials as sources of human salmonellosis. "Twenty-seven per cent. of samples of raw horse meat, 16 per cent. of other raw meat, 11 per cent. of prepared pet meat and 13 per cent. of garden fertilizers were found to be contaminated with salmonellae. Two new types were isolated, one of which has been named Salm. finchley.' "Persons in two of 46 human incidents in the boroughs may have been infected by pet meats. It is suggested that pet foods are probably a more important source of human salmonellosis than the pets themselves. "Garden fertilizers are a potential source of human infection but the risk is probably small. It is suggested that they should not be sold in shops selling food for human consumption." The survey has now been enlarged to cover raw meat for human consumption and cloacal swabs from poultry. HEALTH EDUCATION Health Education comes more and more into the activities of the Public Health Department and in certain subjects it really is the province of the specialist in Health Education. It is my sincere wish that in the near future I shall be able to appoint such a specialist to my staff, even if only in a part-time capacity. Considering the amount spent on material education, the investment in health education is microscopical. A number of talks on this subject were given by myself and other members of the staff to local organisations. MASS RADIOGRAPHY During August/September the Mass Radiography Unit 5B visited Finchley by arrangement with the North-West Regional Hospital Board and sessions were held at five points in the Borough for the general public and industrial groups and at four sites for industrial groups, small firms, etc., only. The importance of the early detection of chest disease was brought to the attention of the public by means of posters, pamphlets, the local press and by direct approach to industrial groups and small firms and as a result, 4,991 persons were X-rayed (3,597 members of the public and 1,394 from industrial groups, etc.). The survey brought to light 3 cases (0.6) of pulmonary tuberculosis and 5 cases (1.0) of lung cancer. The figures in brackets show the rate per 1,000 persons X-rayed. 28 LAUNDRY SERVICE FOR THE INCONTINENT The laundry service, introduced in 1957 to assist in the problems concerning incontinent persons, operates in accordance with the provisions of Section 42 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1956. The washing machine is installed at the Disinfecting Station and arrangements are made for articles to be collected and delivered twice weekly. The practice is for collections and deliveries to be made on Tuesdays and Fridays. The cost of the service is borne by the local authority. The only stipulation made is that the garments or bedding involved must not be of a type which could be accepted by a commercial laundry. The number of persons receiving assistance at the beginning of the year 6 The number of persons for whom the service was recommended and subsequently authorised by the Medical Officer of Health or by the Public Health Inspectors during the year 9 The number of persons receiving assistance at the end of the year 3 During 1961, 363 collections of articles were made. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948—SECTION 47 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951 Removal to Suitable Premises of Persons in need of care and attention Provision is made under Section 47 for securing the necessary care and attention for persons who— (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions, and (b) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. A number of cases, mainly elderly persons living in poor conditions, were brought to my notice but with the help of the social and visiting services and voluntary admission to hospital or home, each case resolved itself and I am pleased to report that it was not necessary to invoke the provisions of the Section. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948—SECTION 50 Burial or Cremation of the Dead It is the duty of the Local Authority to cause to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died or been found dead in the area, in any case where it appears to the Authority that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have "been or are being otherwise made. The expenses incurred may be recovered from the estate of the deceased person, by death grant subject to the contribution conditions being satisfied or from any 29 person who for the purposes of the Act was liable to maintain the deceased person immediately before his death. Any person who has died or been found dead in these circumstances in Finchley is buried in the St. Pancras Cemetery. No burials were carried out by the Council during the year. BURIAL ACT, 1857 Licences for the removal of human remains under the above Act state, inter alia, "It is considered advisable that the Medical Officer of Health should be notified whenever such a licence is granted in order that he may be in a position to take (under his general powers) any action that may appear to him to be necessary in the interests of public health." Seven copies of licences for such removals were received from the Home Office during the year. The exhumations were carried out in the early hours of the morning and were visited when necessary by one of the public health inspectors, to ensure compliance with the conditions of the licences. MORTUARY The Council provide a mortuary under the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1936, and from time to time the Coroner, whose district includes Finchley, uses his power in Section 24 of the Coroner's Amendment Act, 1926, to direct that bodies from the Potters Bar and Friern Barnet Urban Districts, which are also within his district, shall be taken to the Finchley mortuary. One hundred and seventy-one bodies were received into the mortuary during 1961 and of these, 36 were from Friern Barnet and 20 from Potters Bar. Post Mortem examinations were carried out in all cases. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS Twenty-seven persons were examined on appointment to the Council's staff and 2 workmen were examined with a view to their admission to the Council's Sickness Pay Scheme. In addition, 10 employees were examined for the purpose of extending sick pay, and, in the case of elderly employees, for proposed extension of service. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply The bulk of the water is supplied to the Borough by the Lee Valley Water Company and the supply, during the year, has been satisfactory in quality and quantity. Reports on 430 bacteriological and 14 chemical samples taken by the Company were forwarded to me. In all cases the water conformed to standards of purity considered suitable for public supply. 30 The water supply to all dwellings in the Borough is direct from the public water mains. Sewerage and Sewage Disposal Finchley has been completely sewered for many years, and, where necessary, works of enlargement have been carried out. So far as sewage disposal is concerned, it should be pointed out that the Sewage Works situated in the East of the Borough are seriously overloaded and considerable effort has to be made to maintain a satisfactory effluent. However, work on the East Middlesex main drainage scheme is proceeding, and it is hoped that Finchley will be joined to this scheme in 1963. Periodic tests are carried out on the effluent from the Sewage Disposal Works. I am grateful to Mr. P. M. Spencer, the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, for this information. Housing I refer again to the housing of elderly persons and with the kind assistance of the Borough Housing Officer I give details of the Council's activities in this connection during 1961:- Number of purpose-built elderly persons' units, excluding one caretaker's flat, completed 20 Number of elderly persons' units made available by conversion 20 A number of the occupants of these units are suffering from disabilities and are, to some extent, "handicapped persons." It should be remembered that the Council have done quite a lot in this direction for many years, as numbers of ordinary one-bedroom units which were built before the term "elderly persons' dwellings "became" fashionable "have, in fact, provided homes for old people. Approximately 60 of the Council's ordinary one-bedroom dwellings are so used at the moment in addition to the purpose-built elderly persons' dwellings erected prior to January, 1960, which number twenty-nine, plus similar units provided by conversions amounting to twenty-eight. The Public Health Department continued to be actively concerned with housing applications, in some cases supported by medical certificates, referred by the Borough Housing Officer for consideration of additional points on medical grounds. Additional points awarded:- Points Award Number of Applicants 1 3 2 5 3 6 4 7 5 (maximum) 3 In addition, observations were requested on a number of applications in respect of the sanitary circumstances and state of overcrowding. In special cases where the 31 medical conditions merited urgent rehousing but the award of "additional points" did not give immediate help the matter was submitted to the Housing Committee, the medical report being considered in each case. Housins Act, 1957—Overcrowding Persons Involved Dwellings Families Adults Children Number at 1st January, 1961 29 31 113 27 New cases reported 8 8 31 14 Number of cases relieved 12 12 37 14 Number outstanding at 31st ber, 1961 25 27 107 27 No further overcrowding has occurred in those dwellings dealt with by the Council.

Clearance Area No. 16 Nos. 4-14 (even), Church Lane, N.2 (6 houses). Slum Clearance Programme, 1961-1965 (inclusive) The Minister of Housing and Local Government in Circular 2/60 requested a further survey of the district and upon inspection it was found that there were approximately 30 houses requiring action within the next five years. It was proposed to deal with six of the houses as a Clearance Area and the remainder as individual unfit houses. In this connection the following premises were dealt with during the year:- Clearance Area No. 17 Nos. 137-147 (odd). East End Road, N.2 (6 houses). This area was represented to the Council and it was declared a Clearance Area under Part III of the Housing Act, 1957. An Order was made and submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government and was subsequently confirmed. At the end of the year four of the houses were vacant, two remaining occupied. No. 9, Lodge Lane, N.12 A Closing Order was made and confirmed by the Council. No. 1 & 2, Fleming Cottages, Great North Road, N.2 and No. 38, Lichfield Grove, N.12 These houses were dealt with informally and demolition was secured by consultation with the owners. 33 Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958—Section 43 This Section deals with the power of local authorities to make advances to any person for the purpose of:— (a) acquiring houses; (b) constructing houses; (c) converting into houses buildings which have been acquired by those persons or acquiring buildings and converting them into houses; (d) altering, enlarging, repairing or improving houses; whether the houses or buildings are within or without the district of the authority or council. Two hundred and thirty-one enquiries were dealt with regarding premises which were the subject of applications for advances under this Section. Rent Act, 1957 This Act came into operation on the 6th July, 1957, since which date the number of applications for certificates of disrepair has continued to decrease, as will be seen below. From 6th July, 1957, to 31st December, 1957 (approximate 6 months) 60 applications From 1st January, 1958 to 31st December, 1958 50 applications From 1st January, 1959, to 31st December, 1959 14 applications From 1st January, 1960, to 31st December, 1960 8 applications From 1st January, 1961, to 31st December, 1961 3 applications Three Certificates of Disrepair were issued in respect of the applications received during 1961. No further applications were received for other Certificates under the Act. Inspections The total number of inspections made during the year was 16,541. At 277 of the houses and other premises visited, defects or nuisances to the number of 825 were discovered. At the end of the year 756 had been remedied or abated and the work in connection with 31 was in hand. In order to ascertain that the sanitary defects were being properly remedied, 242 visits were paid to the respective premises while the work was in progress. The total number of inspections made in regard to each section of work is recorded below, together with a summary of the sanitary improvements carried out:- Inspections under Housing Acts 69 Other Inspections including Inspections under Public Health Acts 2,826 Re-Inspections 2,053 Inspections under Rent Act, 1957 12 Inspection of Works in Progress 242 Inspections of Factories and Workplaces (including Bakehouses and Restaurant Kitchens) 494 34 Visits to Slaughterhouse 28 Inspections of Cowsheds, Dairies and Milkshops 6 Inspections of Ice Cream Premises 55 Inspections of Meat, Fish and Other Food Shops 806 Inspections of Shops (Shops Act) 157 Visits re Infectious Disease 208 Visits re Rodent Control 2,233 Visits re Overcrowding 64 Visits re Hawkers 34 Visits to Hairdressers' Premises 41 Visits re Pet Animals Act, 1951 16 Visits re Heating Appliances 2 Visits re Clean Air Act, 1956 (including Smoke Control Survey)6,470 Miscellaneous 725 16,541 Complaints One thousand four hundred and seven complaints were received with reference to the following matters, viz.:— Absence of, or defective condition of, dustbins 2 Accumulations of refuse and manure 39 Blocked or defective drains 354 Defective roofs 37 Defective W.C.s 19 Dirty milk bottle 3 Flooding 11 Foreign matter in food 6 Insanitary or defective condition of houses 68 Noise 14 Non-removal of refuse 7 Nuisances from dampness 33 Nuisances from the burning of refuse 37 Nuisances from the keeping of animals or poultry 10 Pollution 1 Pigeons 2 Smoke nuisances 11 Unsatisfactory Housing Conditions, including Overcrowding 26 Unsound Food 15 Verminous condition of houses 15 Premises infested with other insects 41 Wasps' nests 130 35 Bees 13 Premises infested with rats or mice 423 Foxes 3 Squirrels 1 Other complaints 86 The complaints were investigated promptly and in those cases in which the Council had power to intervene the necessary steps were taken to remove the cause of complaint.

It has been found that the home conditions are quite satisfactory. The following table shows, by trades, the number of outworkers residing in the district, and who were notified to me in the August lists as required by Section 110(i) (c) of the Factories Act, 1937 :— Wearing apparel 23 Curtains and furniture hanging 1 Lampshades 10 Making of brushes 1 Making of boxes 3 Fancy Goods 1 There were no cases of default in sending lists to the Council (Section 110) and no instances of work in unwholesome premises (Section 111). 40 Sanitary Conveniences There are 32 conveniences attached to public houses within the Borough. These premises are inspected periodically. There are 14 public conveniences in the Borough, including those in recreation grounds. Thirteen of these conveniences provide accommodation for both sexes and one for males only. Places of Public Entertainment The cinema, dance halls and other places of public entertainment have been inspected, special attention being given to the condition and adequacy of the sanitary accommodation. Five defects were discovered as a result of these inspections and were remedied after notice had been given to the person responsible. Twenty-four premises were inspected and a report was submitted to the Middlesex County Council which is the licensing authority. Swimming Pools Finchley has two Swimming Pools, Squires Lane Baths and the Open Air Pools in the High Road, N.12. The latter comprises Adult and Children's Pools and is said to be one of the finest examples in the London Area. I am grateful to Mr. P. M. Spencer, the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, under whose control the baths are operated, for the following report:— "Both establishments are equipped with modern filtration and chlorination plants. The water is drawn from the public water supply and is continuously filtered on a six-hour cycle, make-up water being added as necessary to cover losses by evaporation, filter washing and other causes. The chlorination is controlled in accordance with the latest practice in this important subject. "Samples of the water are taken regularly for bacteriological examination and the results are consistently satisfactory. This reflects greatly to the credit of the staff directly concerned with the operation of the purification plants, for the bathing load is frequently heavy. In the 1961 season, 192,170 people visited the pools." One hundred and eighteen samples of the water were taken by the Public Health Inspectors during the year. 41 RODENT CONTROL The form in which the statistics in this Section is reported has been amended so as to bring it into line with the data in the Report to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food. Summary of work carried out Type of Property (1) Local Authority (2) Dwelling Houses (inc. Council Houses) (3) All Other (including Business Premises) (4) Total of Cols. (1), (2) & (3) 1.

Number of properties inspected which were found to be infested by (a) Rats 21 176 57 254 (b) Mice 7 83 20 110 4. Number of infested properties (in 3 above) treated by Local Authority 22 241 68 331 Following visits to 223 premises, in addition to those from which notification had been received, 58 instances of rat infestation were found. Of the 364 premises at which evidence of infestation by rats or mice was found 59 were food premises and poultry was kept at 4 addresses only. In 7 cases smoke tests were applied to rat runs and as a result defects in drains or sewers were revealed in 5 cases. The necessary remedial works were carried out. Treatment of Sewers The 29 th and 30th maintenance treatments of sewers were carried out in May and October respectively when baits of oiled warfarin incorporating a mould inhibitor were used. Of 38 manholes in which there was evidence of rate infestation in May all but one were cleared of infestation when rechecked with test baits in October, having been baited to extinction in the earlier treatment. 42 In order to undertake the treatment of sewers it is necessary to have the temporary use of men and equipment from the Department of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, to whom I am grateful for co-operation. The amount of work involved is shown below:— May, 1961 October, 1961 Total number of manholes baited 785 530 Number of poison " takes" 38 36 It is important to keep the rat population in the sewers at as low a level as possible so as to limit the possibility of surface infestation. When buildings are demolished prior to new development, rats may escape from a sewer by way of severed drains, and though every effort is made to have connections sealed off at the time of demolition, works of excavation may subsequendy open up the drain and leave a possible source of future surface infestation. 43 CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 The above Act deals with the control of dark smoke, smoke from furnaces, smoke control areas and special cases of smoke emission, which include special processes to be dealt with under the Alkali Act, colliery spoil-banks, railway engines, vessels and Crown premises. It also makes provision for the establishment of a Clean Air Council for England and Wales. Certain sections of the Act came into operation on the 31st December, 1956, including those relating to the height of chimneys and to smoke control areas. The remaining provisions came into operation on the 1st June, 1958, and included those relating to the prohibition of dark smoke from chimneys, measures for dealing with grit and dust from furnaces, abatement of smoke nuisances and the application of the Act to railway engines, vessels and Crown premises. With regard to the making of smoke control areas, any local authority may make an Order, which must be confirmed by the Minister declaring the whole or any part of its district as a smoke control area. Subject to any stated exceptions and limitations, the emission of chimney smoke in such an area, on any day, is an offence unless the emission was caused only by the burning of an authorised fuel. If the owner or occupier of a private dwelling which is in, or will be in, a smoke control area, has to incur expenditure for adapting his heating arrangements the local authority shall repay him seven-tenths of the cost, four-tenths of which is recoverable from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. In 1958, the Council passed a resolution to make the whole of the Borough a smoke control area within 10 years. At the request of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, local authorities had to submit to the Minister their proposals with regard to the making of smoke control areas for the next five years. The Council decided that all that portion of the Borough, lying to the south of the railway line from the Borough boundary in the west to the North Circular Road, and thence south of the North Circular Road to the Borough boundary in the east should be included in this programme. A survey of the following 5 areas was completed during 1960 and the Orders came into operation on 1st September, 1961:— Area. No. of Premises Acreage (i) Basing Estate, N.3 200 12.6 (2) Red Lion Hill, N.2 291 10.3 (3) Elmshurst Estate, N.2 171 10.1 (4) Part of Hampstead Garden Suburb, N.2 and N.W.11 1,546 446.0 (5) Part of Hampstead Garden Suburb, N.2, and East Finchley, N.2 932 110.4 Total 3,140 589.4 44 C AvtNUC. ivrri The survey of Area No. 6 was completed during the year. This area, comprising 2,414 premises (332.1 acres), is to the north of Area No. 4 and to the west of Area No. 5, and is bounded by the railway line in the north and by the North Circular Road in the west. The Order made by the Council in respect of this area was subsequently confirmed by the Minister and will come into operation on 1st October, 1962. Area No. 7 (1,934 premises—207 acres) is bounded on the north by the London Transport Executive railway, on the west by Regents Park Road to Henly's Corner and on the south and east by the North Circular Road from Henly's Corner to the London Transport Executive railway. The survey of this area was commenced in September, 1961. In addition to the publicity required by statute, the Council's policy with regard to Clean Air and Smoke Control programme has been widely circulated and also, during the year, lectures were given by members of the staff to organisations in the district. Further information was made available to the public by the Mobile Exhibition Unit of the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation which was stationed at various sites. Smoke Abatement The factory chimneys in the area have been kept under observation and generally iittle nuisance from smoke or grit has occurred. Eleven complaints were received during the year concerning industrial and domestic chimneys. In addition, 37 complaints were received with regard to the burning of garden and other refuse and action was taken in a number of cases where it was considered that burning was habitual and causing a nuisance. A considerable number of installations, both industrial and domestic, are still being converted or installed for oil burning. Many enquiries are received by the Petroleum Inspector from persons desirous of installing oil fired plant and for the safe storage of the oil and whilst advice is freely given it is sometimes refused in the absence of the necessary legislation to control this matter. Atmospheric Pollution Continuing the Council's policy of replacing deposit gauges by volumetric apparatus for the determination of smoke and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere a further apparatus was installed during 1961. The equipment in operation is sited as follows:— (1) Public Health Department, 308, Regents Park Road, N.3 (July, 1960). (2) Public Library, High Road, East Finchley, N.2 (March, 1961). 47 Arrangements were also made for an additional site at the Public Library, Ravensdale Avenue, North Finchley, N.12; the apparatus was installed but was not in operation at the end of the year. The following table and graphs show the measurements of pollution recorded during 1961 at the Public Health Department.

These food hygiene regulations lay down requirements in respect of the cleanliness of food premises and stalls, and of apparatus and equipment, the hygienic handling of food, the cleanliness of persons engaged in the handling of food and of their clothing, and the action to be taken where they suffer from or are carriers of certain infections; the construction of food premises, their repair and maintenance and the facilities including sinks and wash basins to be provided; and the temperature at which certain foods are to be kept. 1. Number of Inspections: The Public Health Inspectors continued a survey of food premises and during the year, 1,145 visits were made to shops and other premises in order to ascertain compliance with the Regulations, and arising therefrom 185 contraventions were found, and 59 letters sent and 56 verbal notices given in connection therewith.

All these premises have been visited and the provision of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations which provide for the cleanliness of the premises, apparatus, utensils and vehicles, the precautions to be taken against the contamination of meat, the storage and removal of refuse, etc., have generally been well observed. Bakehouses The number of bakehouses in the Borough was 17. At 16 bakehouses motive power is used. The bakehouses have been visited by the Public Health Inspectors and steps have been taken to cause them to be maintained in a proper sanitary condition. The periodical cleansing of these premises, as required by statute, has generally been carried out. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops At the beginning of the year there were 8 dairies in the district registered under the Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959. One dairy closed during the year. All premises were inspected from time to time. The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960, came into operation on 1st January, 1961, in so far as they relate to dealers’ licences and provide, inter alia, that dealers’ licences will be granted by the food and drugs authority and the period for which these licences will be granted is extended from one year to five years. Dealers’ licences now permit sales outside as well as inside the area of the licensing authority and supplementary licences are discontinued. Details of the issue of licences are contained in the Middlesex County Council Public Control Department's report (page 60). Ice Cream Premises The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1959, control the method by which ice cream should be manufactured. Most of the ice cream sold is manufactured outside the Borough. There were 166 premises registered for the sale of ice cream. Fish Friers At the end of 1961 there were eight premises in the district where the business of fish frying is carried out. Game Licences Fourteen applications were received under Section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1894, from tradesmen in the Borough for licences to deal in game. A licence was granted in each instance. 54 Display of Dog Notices in Food Shops Notices for exhibition have been supplied to all food shops in the district, pointing out that the presence of dogs is a danger to the health of the public. School Kitchens A number of visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to school kitchens and the staffs are to be commended on the high standard of cleanliness which has been maintained. Hawkers There were 22 hawkers registered under the requirements of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944, of which 6 were barrow boys operating in the district; two more than the previous year. SLAUGHTERHOUSES ACT, 1958 SLAUGHTER OF ANIMALS, 1958 Report on Slaughterhouse Facilities There is one private slaughterhouse operating in the district from which the owner obtains part of his supplies of home-killed meat for sale in his own shops in Finchley and adjoining districts, including Hornsey, Hendon, Barnet and Friern Barnet. In addition this facility is used by local pig keepers who need occasional and seasonal accommodation. An undertaking was given by the occupier of the slaughterhouse to carry out the works necessary to comply with the Act. The Alinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food accepted the Report of the Recommendations but postponed the date of operation until April, 1961. Humane Slaughter of Animals In accordance with the provisions of the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1958, all animals slaughtered in a slaughterhouse within the district must be stunned by means of a mechanically operated instrument kept in good repair. This method of slaughter continues to prove satisfactory. Licensed Slaughtermen The Act also provides that no animal shall be slaughtered or stunned by any person who is not the holder of a licence granted by the local authority. The licences granted by the Council have to be renewed annually. Two persons were licensed during 1961. 55 Carcases and Offal Inspected and Condemned in Whole or in Part Cattle excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Horses Number killed (if known) — — 1 — 201 — Number inspected — — 1 — 201 — All Diseases except Tuberculosis and Cysticerci: Whole carcases condemned — — — — 1 Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned — — — — 19 — Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than tuberculosis and cysticerci - - -- - 9.95 - Tuberculosis only: Whole carcases condemned - - - - - - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - — - — 1 — Percentage of the number inspected affected with tuberculosis — — - — 0.50 — Cysticercosis: Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - - - - - - Carcases submitted to treatment by refrigeration - - - - - - Generalised and totally condemned - - - - - - Unsound Food Condemned (1) In Slaughterhouses Tuberculosis Pigs Head 1 Other Diseases Pigs Hearts 7 (Pericarditis) Livers 2 (Cirrhosis) Lungs (pairs) 10 (Pneumonia) Whole Carcase 1 (Casualty) Spleen 1 (Haemorrhage) 56 (2) In Shops Cattle Beef 259 lbs.

Another greengrocer was prosecuted for labelling “ Golden Delicious” apples and “ Lavine” apples as “ Newtowns” and for selling “ Lavine” apples as “ Newtowns.” He was fined £3 0s. 0d. on each of three summonses and ordered to pay £6 6s. 0d. towards the costs. Soft Drinks: A sample of lemon juice was found to contain some small particles which on analysis were found to be charcoal derived from one of the manufacturing processes. In the circumstances no action was taken against the manufacturer. A sample of imported canned vitaminised apple juice was found to be deficient in vitamin “ C.” A second sample of the same product procured a short while afterwards was found to be correct and no further action was taken in respect of the deficient sample. Spirits: A sample of cognac which was submitted by a member of the public was found to be adulterated with 8% of methylated spirit. It transpired that the sale took place in a foreign capital and no action was therefore possible. Vinegar: Two samples of vinegar, both procured from the same supplier, were deficient in acetic acid. Investigation showed that the deficiency was due to loss of strength in storage. An official caution was issued. 59 The Public Control Department also reported upon the following matters:— Merchandise Marks Act, 1887-1953: Inspections are carried out under the above Acts to ensure that the requirements of the various Marking Orders relating to the indication of origin of imported foodstuffs are applied. Inspections were made at 158 premises and a total of 570 displays were examined. Minor breaches of the Orders were dealt with by verbal warnings. A more serious infringement, in which “ Cyprus” grape fruit were described and sold as “ Jaffas,” was dealt with by prosecution. The greengrocer concerned was fined £5 0s. 0d. on each of two summonses and ordered to pay £3 3s. 0d. towards the costs. Safe Milk: Eighty-four samples of raw milk were procured in the Borough and tested for the presence of tubercle bacilli. All were satisfactory. From the 1st January, 1961, the County Council became the licensing authority for the issue of licences to dealers with premises within its area and 33 such licences were issued in lespect of the sale of milk to which the special designations “ pasteurised,” “ sterilized ” and “ tuberculin tested ” could be applied. The period for which these licences were granted has been extended from one year to five years. Thirty-nine samples of milk were obtained to test for proper heat treatment and subsequent storage. All were satisfactory. The County Council continue to license those premises at which milk is processed, two being issued for plants in the Borough. Forty-six inspections of premises were made to ensure proper compliance with the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960. The Labelling of Food Order, 1953: The Labelling of Food Order requires prepacked food to be marked with the name and address of the packer or labeller or to bear a registered trade mark; to be marked with its common or usual name and to bear a statement of ingredients if the food consists of more than one ingredient. It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed. In the Borough of Finchley a total of 202 premises were visited and 800 items of food were examined for compliance with the Order. No infringements were disclosed. Labelling and Advertising Infringements: In addition to the detail given above, a considerable volume of work was done the period under review, which did not arise from samples procured in the area of Finchley, but which had the effect of protecting the residents in each county district. The matters dealt with were in respect of nationally retailed articles of food. Several manufacturers were required to designate the ingredients on labels of ..nstant Coffee. As a result of a complaint of the taste of a soft drink, investigations jiade in the Public Control Department showed that there was phenolic contamination 60 which arose from a chemical reaction between chlorinated water and the phenol formaldehyde stopper. The manufacturer has modified the ingredients of this product to prevent the chemical reaction. The manufacturer of a non-alcoholic wine was challenged on the ground that the description was a contradiction in terms, and the label was amended to “ non-alcoholic beverage.” The importer of a slimming food was challenged on claims made in advertising literature as to the Vitamin concentration, and the literature was corrected. A manufacturer's claim of slimming properties for “ reducing perles” was challenged and the product withdrawn. The claim relied on the presence of purgatives and bladderwrack. The slimming claims made for a lemon juice in a television advertisement were modified after the manufacturer had been challenged as to the efficiency of the product as a slimming agent. Modifications to the labels of several brands of canned chicken were secured, where it was not apparent from the label that the contents of the cans were not solely chicken, but chicken in jelly or broth. Legal Proceedings No legal proceedings were instituted by the Borough Council during the year under this section of the report. 61 SHOPS ACT, 1950 Inspection of shops in the Borough has been carried out and complaints and contraventions dealt with. Particulars in regard to shops on the Register are as follows:— Number on Register at beginning of 1961 947 Number closed 20 New shops 4 Number on Register at end of 1961 931 Changes of Occupancy 20 The number of persons observing the Jewish Sabbath and registered in accordance with the provisions of Section 53 of the Act was thirteen. CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 1961 HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) REGULATIONS, 1953 The Consumer Protection Act, 1961, which came into operation on 19th August, 1961, repealed the Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952. The Regulations of 1953, however, remain in force and inspections were made of new fires on sale at premises within the Borough. There were no contraventions of the requirements of the Regulations. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 Two traders whose premises come within the definition of the Act are registered. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 The number of persons licensed at the end of the year was 6. All premises have been inspected. LAND CHARGES ACT, 1925 Outstanding Notices One thousand, seven hundred and fifty memoranda were received during the year from the Town Clerk enquiring whether or not there were any outstanding notices with respect to certain properties in the district. The necessary searches were made and the required information furnished. 62 GENERAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE STATUTORY AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES AVAILABLE IN THE BOROUGH STATUTORY SERVICES PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES Health Services under Part III of the National Health Service Act, 1946, are provided by the Middlesex County Council.

MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES The Borough of Finchley forms part of the EAST CENTRAL DIVISION for Mental Health Services in the Middlesex County Council. Divisional Office: 2, Maryland Road, Wood Green, N.22. (Tel.: BOWes Park 4281). Senior Medical Officer: Dr. R. C. Greenberg. Divisional Mental Welfare Officer: Mr. W. J. Ward. Mental Welfare Officers: Mr. E. Inglis; Miss M. Lay; Mr. C. Carr; Miss J. E. Maclean. Mental Health Social Worker: Miss C. M. Coups. Psychiatric Social Workers: Mrs. J. I. Jansen; Miss E. Arkinstall. The mental health social worker makes regular visits to the homes of all the sub-normal and severely sub-normal females and males up to the age of ten years and advises on all aspects of the patient's well being and employment in appropriate cases. She submits written reports on her visits so that where necessary the County Medical Officer may take appropriate action such as arranging admission to psychiatric hospitals either on a temporary or permanent basis. Such temporary admissions, of up to eight weeks, are arranged to meet acute domestic difficulties or ill health of mother. The mental welfare officers deal similarly with the sub-normal and severely sub-normal males over the age of ten years. The main duty of the mental welfare officers is the care and in part the after-care of those persons suffering from mental illness including dealing with those requiring compulsory detention in psychiatric hospitals under the Mental Health Act, 1959. Both the mental welfare officers and the mental health social workers transport patients in their cars to and from the psychiatric hospitals. The psychiatric social workers are largely concerned with the after-care and rehabilitation of persons discharged after undergoing treatment either in hospitals or at out-patient clinics but also deal with a similar type of case who may not have had to enter a psychiatric hospital and in cases referred from the National Assistance Board because of chronic unemployment. As regards the general practitioners, they receive via the Middlesex Executive Council, a schedule setting out the information given above and also the procedure under which they may obtain the services of a mental welfare officer outside normal office hours. 65 In addition to the home visiting service, there are junior training schools for the young severely sub-normal and adult training centres for those of sixteen years of age and over. Although at present there are none of these establishments actually sited within the Borough, some Finchley children are transported daily by coach to the newly opened purpose-built Friern Barnet Junior Training School and Finchley youths and girls are taken by coach to the newly built Edmonton Adult Training Centre. A therapeutic social club is run under the direction of Miss Arkinstall, Psychiatric Social Worker, for incipient mental cases and for those discharged from psychiatric hospitals who are in need of after-care, at York Park Day Nursery, York Road, Hendon, N.W.9, at 7 p.m. every Tuesday evening. It is the County Council's intention to increase the above facilities and to provide, in addition, hostel accommodation for the mentally disordered living in the community.
