In last year's Report it was stated that the paving of the tramway margins in the Camberwell Road, between Boundary Lane and Camberwell Green was in hand. This work has been satisfactorily completed by the contractors (Messrs. Mowlem & Co.). Following on in this description of work, the Vestry determined to similarly pave the margins in the Old Kent Road, between Mina Road and the Parish boundary at White Post Lane, and for this purpose a loan of £17,000 has been obtained from the Metropolitan Board of Works. The contract for the work has been entered into with Messrs. Mowlem & Co., and at the date of this report the work is well in hand. Also the Vestry determined to pave the margins 10 in Queen's Road, Peckham Road and Camberwell Green, excluding those portions which will be affected by the intended Street widenings by the Metropolitan Board of Works. A loan for which work has been obtained from the Metropolitan Board of Works for £12,500. The above contract at this date has been let to Mr. G. G. Rutty, who will in due course proceed with the work. ROAD WATERING. All Roads under the charge of the Vestry were watered during the past season. Length 68^- miles. Number of Water Vans employed for this purpose 44 Ditto Water Carts ,, ,, 9 53 The charges for water supplied for road watering were as follows:—That by the Southwark and Vauxhall Company and the Kent Company at the rate of £40 per mile, and the Lambeth Company, £35 per mile, per annum. 11 •The total charge for road watering purposes for the season amounted to £1285 13s. 2d., as follows:— Length of Road watered. Charge for water. £ s. d. 20 Miles Water supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company 800 0 0 7£ Miles Water supplied by the Lambeth Water (Company, including Standposts, &c.) 294 3 2 4 Miles Water supplied by the Kent Water Works Company 160 0 0 87 Miles Water procured from 29 Wells, sunk in the lower parts of the Parish by the Yestry, and also by water from the Grand Surrey Canal 31 10 0 68½ Miles. £1,285 13 2 The number of Hydrants and Waterposts, the property of the Vestry, on the Southwark and Vauxliall, and Kent Companies' supply, is 28; in addition to these there are 14 Waterposts on the Lambeth supply, for which the Vestry pay a yearly rental of £1 10s. each post. SLOPPING AND WATERING. This work has in the past year been carried out with the Plant provided for the purpose by the Vestry with the same satisfactory result as in the previous three years. The Depot and Stabling Premises rented of the 12 London Brighton & South Coast Railway Company, which consists of six arches, situate between Lyndhurst and Victoria Roads, Peckham, and also one arch on the east side of Victoria Road, afford stabling accommodation for 70 horses (including loose boxes for isolating the sick horses), also for the hay, straw and fodder stores, and further provides accommodation for carrying out the general repairs to the Plant, the repainting and repairing carts, water vans, &c., and for executing the Smiths' work in shoeing the horses (including those of the Dust Department) repairing tools, &c., &c. The quantity of slop removed from the Roads under charge of the Vestry during the past year was 32,086 loads. This will in future be considerably lessened, on the Main Thoroughfares, which are now being paved with Granite Setts. The Plant in use by the Vestry for this Department during the year 1879-80 was as follows:— Horses 62 Water Vans 44 Water Carts 9 Material Carts 38 Slop Carts 40 Road (Horse) Brooms 3 13 This has been supplemented for the increased work to be performed in 1880-1 and the Plant as now provided is:— Horses 65 Water Vans 46 Water Carts 9 Material Carts 33 Slop Carts 40 Road (Horse) Brooms 4 The horses during the past year have kept in excellent health, little illness has occurred amongst them, and the loss of two only has taken place. This your Committee suggest may be accepted as satisfactory proof of efficient management. The cost of fodder for the above has been £3383 12s. 9d., being equal to about £1 Is. Od. per week per horse. The amount of fodder, etc., consumed and its cost by the above 62 horses during the year 1879-80, was as follows:— Clover. Mixture. Hay. Straw. Oats. Beans. Bran. Loads. Trusses. Loads. Trusses. Loads. Trusses. Loads. Trusses. Qrtrs. Qrtrs. Cwts. 60 22 67 35 61 13 154 12 1303 91 219 14 Equal per horse. Clover, Mixture and Hay 2¼ Trusses. Straw (including bedding) 1¾ „ Oats 31/3 Bushels. = £1 Is. 0d. per horse per week. The total working cost of "Slopping arid Watering" for the past year, including keep of Horses, Wages, Wheelwrights, Superintendent, Horse-keeper, Slop Shoot expenses, Smith's Work, Repairs to Tools, Farrier's Work, Repairing and Painting Plant, &c., amounted to £11,246; but as this sum includes the expense of Cartage of Materials on to the Roads, Road Rolling, and incidental Cartage Works and expenses, which under the contracting system would have entailed an additional payment to the contractors, of about £2634 beyond the amount for Slopping and Watering, this sum has to be deducted from the total as above, viz. :—£11,246, which gives as the actual cost of Watering and Slopping, the amount of £8612 equal to about £125 per mile. This cost per mile agrees very nearly with that which resulted under the contracting system before alluded to, on the supposition that the same rate of charge would have been maintained, but which in all 15 probability would have been much exceeded at the present current charges. This is a matter of much solicitude for the Slop Shoots. future, during the past year several available means of Slop deposit have become closed. In order to counteract this, arrangement has been made with the owner of the Gravel Pit at Maismore Square, Peckham, for the use of that site, at an annual rent of £200. Nevertheless, this is a question of increasing anxiety to your Committee, and one which requires to be seriously entertained in the early future. Your Committee confidently repeat the observations made in their Report for the year 1876-7, that the Vestry system now in operation, has this special advantage "that the work is more efficiently done, "and whether the cost be more or less no payment "has to be made except for work actually executed."

The negociations for the purchase of the property in the lines of these improvements are being carried out by the Metropolitan Board of Works. Up to the present time, no actual progress has been made with the works, but it is reported they will shortly be put in hand. FORMATION OF NEW STREETS. The Metropolitan Board of Works has consulted the Vestry upon 21 applications for sanction to the formation of 33 New Streets within this b 18 Parish.

In all these cases the Metropolitan Board of Works adopted the Vestry's recommendation. LINES OF FRONTAGE, PROJECTIONS, &c., &c., The Metropolitan Board of Works also submitted for the opinion of the Vestry 66 applications for Lines of Frontage, Projections, &c. Each case having been examined and reported upon by the Surveyor, the Vestry recommended the Board to approve of 36, and disapprove 30 of these cases. The Metropolitan Board of Works subsequently notified its approval in 30 cases, and disapproval in 36 cases. In all approved cases, upon the Works being carried out, supervision has been given thereto by the Vestry Officers. 19 STREET NOMENCLATURE.

NEW GULLIES. 298 New Gullies for Road Drainage have been constructed in connection with these Public and Private Sewers. 59 HOUSE DRAINAGE. The number of Houses drained into Sewers under the direction, of the Vestry, during the past year is as follows, viz. :— Houses permanently drained 2340 Do. temporarily drained 3 Total Number of Houses drained 2343 DUST REMOVAL. This work is carried on under the direction of the Sewers Committee and its Dust Sub-Committee, by the staff, which is now thoroughly organized, and with the plant, horses, &c., belonging to the Vestry, resulting in efficiency and economy, as was anticipated at the commencement of the new system of Dust Collection; one of its especial features (and which proves so satisfactory to the Rate-payers), being the regularity of the house-to-house collection at stated days of the week in each respective district. The number of horses and carts employed during the year was 15, being 3 in excess of the previous year; this addition was found to be necessary by 60 reason of the increased work of dusting the Parish, as follows:— 1878-9 No. of Loads removed 15,114 1879-80 „ 16,216 Increase, 1879-80 1,102 Loads Loads of Dust removed. Sale of Dust. As shewn above, the quantity of dust collected was 16,216 loads, of which 12,131 loads were profitably disposed of, and realised the sum of £718 8s. 8d.; the remaining 4,085 loads were conveyed to such available shoots as could be obtained at easy distances from the district of collection. In the last year's Report the Vestry was informed that "at no distant period additional facilities for the disposal of the dust will become absolutely necessary." Your Committee now report that it has been found expedient to make arrangements with barge owners for the removal by water of a part of the dust. This arrangement is economical in those districts situate near to the Canal, where, if disposed of otherwise, from their distance from the Shoots, a long cartage would have been required. Barging away Dust. 61 The expenditure of the dust department during the year, which includes the wages of collectors of the dust, drivers, superintendent, shoot clerk, and stable keeper, also the cost of fodder, veterinary attendances, and all other incidental expenses, Amounted to £2,779 4 11 Less Sale of Dust 718 8 8 Nett Cost £2,060 16 3 Cost of Dust Collection. The above statement shews that the nett cost of the dust removal for the year 1879-80, comprising 16,216 loads, was £2,060 16s. 3d., or about 2s. 6d. per load. This, contrasted with the former cost of 5s. 6d. per load, (being the price previous to the alteration of the system), shews a saving of upwards £2,000 per annum. Saving as compared with former system of Collection. GULLY CLEANSING. The number of Gullies cleansed by the Vestry workmen within the Parish during the past year was ... ... ... ... . . . . 4557 Loads of Soil removed therefrom . . 1519 62 SEWERS- The Sewers under the control of the Vestry are in a satisfactory condition; such of the Main Local Sewers as required cleansing and the soil removed therefrom, have been so dealt with, and the quantity of deposit, &c., removed has been 70 loads. DILAPIDATED AND UNHEALTHY DWELLINGS. With regard to unhealthy and dilapidated dwellings. In all cases where it was found necessary, in the interests of the public health, to take steps to remedy the evils complained of, they have been reported by your officers, and the necessary Notices served, under "Torrens' Act." In every instance so dealt with, the Vestry orders have been complied with, and the property repaired and rendered habitable. PUBLIC URINALS. The nine Urinals as below under the charge of 63 the Vestry have been regularly cleansed and repaired. The cost of the water supply is £6 per annum each. 1 Camberwell Green. 2 Wyndham Road. 3 Addington Square. 4 Old Kent Road. 5 Wells Street. 6 Southampton Street. 7 Sumner Road. 8 Peckham High Street. 9 Peckham Rye. INSPECTION OF HOUSES, &c.

The particulars of the above work will appear in detail in the Report of the Medical Officer. 64 FOOD ADULTERATION, &c. The Quarterly Reports of the Public Analyst will show the duties imposed on the Vestry under the Adulteration Act; these are appended to the Committee's Report.

BRISTOWE, M.D., Lond, Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians; Senior Physician to and Lecturer on Medicine at St. Thomas's Hospital; Examiner in Medicine to the Royal College of Surgeons ; and President of the Society of Medical Officers of Health. Gentlemen, According to the Registrar-General's Annual Report for 1879, the population of London estimated for the middle of that year was 3,620,868, the births were 134,096, and the deaths 85,540. The birth-rate was 36.5 per each 1000 of the population, the deathrate was 23.3 ; the birth-rate in the previous year having been 36.1, the death-rate 23.5. There is consequently a decided, though not a large, improvement 68 in the health of the metropolis in 1879 as compared with 1878. Among the more important facts in regard to the mortuary returns of the year are the following:— Small pox, which in 1877 caused 2544 deaths, and in 1878 1416, in 1879 caused only 458, of which 221 occurred in the first quarter, 140 in the second, 63 in the third, and 34 in the last. Measles, to which 1510 deaths were attributed in 1878, was fatal to 2488 persons in 1879. Scarlet Fever was fatal in 1792 cases in 1878, and in 2706 cases in 1879. Diphtheria caused 558 deaths in 1878, and 522 in 1879. Whooping Cough, which was fatal to 4446 persons in 1878 was fatal to 3000 in 1879. And Continued Fever, which destroyed 1361 lives in the former year, destroyed 1099 in the latter. Probably the most remarkable sanitary fact of the year was the extraordinarily low rate of mortality from Autumnal Diarrhoea. This is, doubtless, attributable to the unusually low temperature of the summer months. The deaths from this cause, which were 3651 in 1878, fell to 1913 in 1879. It will be observed, therefore, that while there was a considerable increase in deaths for Measles and Scarlet Fever, there was a large diminution in the case of Whooping Cough, and a 69 still more remarkable diminution as regards Diarrhoea and Small-pox, which latter had been prevailing as an epidemic for the previous two years. Of the five groups of districts into which London is divided for registration purposes, the mortuary rates for 1879 were as follows:—Western, 21.1 ; Northern, 22.0; Central, 26; Eastern, 25.7; and Southern, 23.3. The death-rate of the Southern districts in 1878 was 24.2. I will now proceed to the sanitary statistics of our own Parish. The births registered in 1879 amounted to 6386, a number larger by 505 than that registered in the previous year. Of these 1610 were registered in the first quarter, 1498 in the second, 1564 in the third, and 1714 in the fourth. In Dulwich the births were 82, or three more than in 1878 ; in Camberwell 1733, or 174 more than in 1878 ; in Peckham 2617, or 150 more than in 1878; and in St. George's 1954, or 178 more than in the previous year. The deaths registered in 1879 were 3511, or 163 more than in 1878. Of these 1004 were due to the first 70 quarter of the year, 882 to the second, 610 to the third, and 1015 to the fourth. 39 of the total number were returned for Dulwich, 16 less than in 1878; 1206 for Camberwell, or 149 more than in 1878; 1300 for Peckham, or 22 less than in 1878; and 966 for St. George's, or 52 less than in 1878. 1746 of the deaths occurred in males, 1765 in females. It is my duty now to determine, so far as I am able, from the amount and character of the mortuary returns, the sanitary state of the Parish during the year to which these returns relate. The subject is, unfortunately, as I have shewn over and over again, by no means so simple of investigation or so trustworthy in its results as might at first sight be supposed; for the determination of the mortuary rate depends on the determination of the mean population for the year, and also as regards the districts on a re-arrangement of the mortuary returns, which is to a large extent guess-work. The population of the Parish of Camberwell is a varying, though on the whole a rapidly increasing, population. And hence, if we take it to be now exactly what it was ascertained to be at the Census of 71 1871, a number far below what it certainly is at the present time, we shall find, on comparing the actual number of deaths occurring in the year with it, that the mortuary rate is exceedingly high, and one which would seemingly imply extreme unhealthiness. But how can we determine what the increase of population has been in Camberwell and in each of its sub-districts during the 8 years which have elapsed from the Census-taking of 1871 to the middle of the year 1879 ? The most obvious and simplest plan, and that usually adopted, is to assume, for an augmenting population, that the population has been increasing uniformly since the last Census at the same annual rate at which it was ascertained to have increased during the ten years which intervened between the last two Census-takings. Now between 1861 and 1871 the population of Camberwell increased at the annual rate of 45 per 1000 ; but this increase was made up of an annual increase : for Dulwich of 89 per 1000; for Camberwell proper of 39 per 1000; for Peckham of 41 per 1000; and for St. George's of 52 per 1000. And if these several rates of increase have been maintained down to the middle of 1879 the population of the entire Parish would have amounted at that time to about 161,463, including a population of 8,168 in Dulwich, one of 42,885 in Camberwell, 72 one of ,58,853 in Peckham, and one of 51,557 in St. George's. Now, as I shall presently explain, these estimates are certainly fallacious. But I will accept them for the present, and proceed to determine the death-rate in accordance with them. But before the deaths can be fairly utilized for ascertaining the death-rate of the sub-districts of Camberwell, it is necessary, as before stated, to make some re-arrangement of them. The sub-district of Camberwell includes the Workhouse and two Lunatic Asylums, in which, collectively, no less than 433 deaths occurred in the course of the year. But these deaths belong (in estimating the death-rate) not more to the sub-district in which they are included than to the other sub-districts of the Parish ; and hence it becomes necessary to distribute them proportionately among the several districts. For this purpose I have deducted them from the returns for the Camberwell sub-district, and have then distributed them among all the districts, in proportion to the number of deaths (exclusive of them) returned for each. The result is shewn in the accompanying table. 73 Actual Returns of Death. Deaths in Workhouse and Lunatic Asylums redistributed. Estimates of Death. Dulwich 99 + 5 = 44 Camberwell 1206—433 + 109 = 802 Peckham 1300 + 183 = 1483 St. George's 966 + 136 = 1102 Total 3511—433 + 433 = 3511 On these estimates of population and of deaths, the death-rate for 1879 was, for Dulwich, 5.39 per 1000; for Camberwell sub-district, 20.57; for Peckham, 25.2; for St. George's, 21.37 ; and for the whole Parish, 21.74. The discrepancies here are so obvious that on the face of them no one could well accept them as even approximative estimates of the mortuary rates. It is almost absurd to suppose that the deathrate of Dulwich was as low as 5.39 per 1000 ; and equally absurd to believe that the death-rate of Peckham exceeded that of St. George's by nearly 4 in the 1000; for though Dulwich is no doubt healthy, the residents there are not so long lived as a mortality of 5 in the 1000 implies; and though Peckham contains 74 some of the poorest parts of the parish, and on that account is likely to have a comparatively high deathrate, it is not inferior to St.George's in these respects, and little, if at all, below the Camberwell sub-district. The errors on which these discrepancies depend are no doubt contained in the estimates of population. That they are wrong is rendered almost absolutely certain by the results of deducing the amount of the population from the birth-rate. No doubt the birth-rate, like the death-rate, is liable to fluctuation yet on the whole the birth-rate is more constant than the death-rate, and there is reason to believe that it does not vary largely from year to year for the different districts of the Parish, and for the Parish as a whole. At the Census of 1871 the birth-rate of Dulwich was 22 per 1000; that of Camberwell, 35 per 1000; and that of Peckham and St. George's 36.5 per 1000. On the assumption that these figures still represent the respective birth-rates of the different sub-districts, we may estimate that the 82 births in Dulwich in 1879 occurred in a population of 3727; that the 1733 births in Camberwell occurred in a population of 49,514; that the 2617 births in Peckham occurred in a population of 71,698 ; that the 75 1714 births in St. George's occurred in a population of 53,534; and that the population of the entire Parish amounted to no less than 178,473. On these estimates of the population the death-rate of Dulwich becomes 11.8 instead of 5.39, that of Camberwell, 17.8 instead of 20.57 ; that of Peckham, 20.5 instead 25.2 ; that of St. George's, 20.6 instead of 21.37 ; and that of the whole Parish, 19.7 instead of 21.74. It will be observed that the returns are in many respects strikingly different from those first obtained ; that according to them the population of Dulwich is not more than half the former estimate, while the death-rate is doubled ; that the population of Camberwell becomes increased by between 6000 and 7000 persons; that of Peckham by more than 12,000; that of St. George's by about 2000; and that of the entire Parish by about 17,000; and that the deathrates of these sub-districts, and of the Parish as a whole, undergo a corresponding diminution and present a more natural uniformity. Under any circumstances, however, the death-rate of Dulwich appears to be remarkably low, and to point to extraordinary healthiness of the population, and the death-rates of Camberwell, St. George's, and the entire Parish, are. highly satisfactory. As regards Peckham there is no 76 doubt that the mortuary rate of 25.2 per 1000, obtained by the first method of calculation, is altogether erroneous. There is nothing to shew (apart from this) that Peckham is more unhealthy than St. George's; there is much to render it absolutely certain that its population is largely in excess of 58,852, on the basis of which this high mortality was obtained; and, in fact, there is no reasonable doubt that the larger estimate of population, and the lower estimate of the death-rate are approximately true. I have made the above calculations and the above suggestions as I have made them for several years past, with a gradually increasing sense of insecurity and doubt. For as year by year has elapsed since the last Census was taken, disturbing influences have been at work in the Parish to interfere more and more with the trustworthiness of my calculations. Next year the Census will again be taken, and it will be interesting in my next Annual Report to compare the estimates which I have ventured upon with the result of the actual enumeration which will then be made. If we look at the ages at which deaths took place in 1879, compared with the corresponding statistics of C AMBER WELL — Return of Births and Deaths for the Fifty-Three Weeks ending Saturday, January 3rd, 1880.

The Deaths returned for the Sub-District of Camberwell include 315 occurring in the Workhouse and 118 in the Lunatic Asylums, making a total of 433, 77 the previous year, we observe some remarkable differences. We always find that the heaviest mortality prevails among children under 5 years of age, and that as we approach the other end of the scale the mortality again rises, so that not only is the mortality above 60 years of age increasingly heavy in proportion to persons living at that age, but it is actually heavy. In the year 1879, 928 children were cut off in their first year, and 658 between 1 and 5, altogether 1586 under 5 years of age. Again, 331 deaths occurred between 60 and 70; 324 between 70 and 80 ; 162 between 80 and 90; and 18 over 90; in all 835 above 60. Now in the year 1878, notwithstanding that a smaller total number of deaths was recorded, the mortality under 5 was 81 in excess of that during 1879; on the other hand, the mortality above 60 for the last year exceeded by 145 that registered in the previous year. An advance in the number of deaths at all ages was, of course, to be expected with an increasing population. But the advance here above 60 is larger than might naturally have been expected, while the diminution in the mortality of young children is even more observable. The explanation, however, is not far to seek. The excessive mortality among the aged occurred during the first and last quarters of the year, and was due to the prevalence of 78 pulmonary affections at those periods, to which the old are especially liable to succumb. The diminution in infantile mortality was due entirely to the remarkable absence of diarrhoea during the latter summer months, a phenomenon depending, as already observed, on the exceptionally low temperature which prevailed at that time. I proceed to consider the more important causes of death. To accidental and other violence 44 deaths were attributed, as compared with 59 in 1878. To premature birth, and defective vitality continuing from birth, 250 deaths were assigned, and to childbirth 17 ; 232 deaths from the former cause occurred in 1878, and 19 in the latter. 725 persons died from inflammatory affections of the lungs, against 577 in 1878, a difference of no less than 148. 68 of this excess was due to children under 5 years of age, and 80 to persons above that age. To tubercular diseases no less than 495 deaths were attributed. In 1878 the deaths from, these affections were less by 71. One of the most remarkable sanitary features of the year was the low death-rate due to Diarrhoea. This, as is well, known, is the chief cause of death in young children during the third quarter of the year, and its prevalence at that time is connected with the high tempera- 79 ture that then prevails. The summer of 1879 however, was exceptional in its coldness and inclemancy, which conditions, though they brought much discomfort, and large failure of crops, brought also an improvement in the health of the population, and especially an improvement as regards the prevalence and mortality of diarrhœal affections. In 1878, 176 deaths were referred to diarrhœa, of which 159 occurred in children under 5, and 17 in persons above 5. In 1879 the total diarrhoea mortality sank to 75, of which 66 occurred in children, and 9 in persons of more advanced age. Of the diarrhoea cases which occurred in 1878, 138 were recorded in the summer quarter : of those which occurred in 1879, only 46 were registered during the corresponding period. The particulars and progress of Zymotic Diseases are exhibited in Tables II. and III. In the former of these Tables is shewn the actual mortality due to these several affections year by year, from the year that the Vestry came into existence. In the latter are displayed the fluctuation of these same affections quarterly ever since the year 1871, in which the Census was taken. In examining these Tables, however, it must be borne in mind that no allowance has been made for increase of population; that in 1856 Table II. Hooping Cough. Measles.

Hooping Cough caused 122 deaths in 1879 against 206 in 1878; the deaths were 33 in the first quarter, 30 in the second, 18 in the third, and 51 in the fourth. The deaths from Measles rose from 88 in 1878 to 123 in 1879; of these, 30 occurred in the first quarter, 58 in the second, 18 in the third, and 17 in the last Diphtheria, which had caused 29 deaths in 1878, caused 31 in 1879; 5 cases occurred in the first quarter, 13 in the second, 3 in the third, and 10 in the fourth. Scarlet Fever caused 76 deaths or 17 more than in the previous year. Of these, 17 occurred in the first quarter, 7 in the second, 16 in the third, and 36 in the fourth. Fever was less fatal in 1879 than in 1878 by 6 cases. The deaths due to this cause were 35 only, of which 6 occurred in the first quarter, 8 in the second, 9 in the third, and 12 in the last. Small-pox caused 79 deaths in place of 87 recorded in the previous year. The majority of 83 these deaths occurred during the first half of the year; during the last half there was a very rapid diminution. There is a discrepancy between the deaths from this cause in Table II. on the one hand, and Tables I., and III. on the other. This is due to the circumstance that 41 cases died at Deptford Hospital, which number has been included in Table III., but is omitted from the others. This omission is explained by the difficulty there is in apportioning the hospital cases between the several districts of the Parish. Most of them, however, occurred iu Peckham. It is important to add that the mortuary statistics for the year 1879 are made to include 53 weeks instead of 52, and that on this account the figures are a little more unfavourable in appearance than they should be. On the whole, whether regarded from the point of view of the rates of death to population, or from that of the prevalence of Zymotic Diseases, the year must be regarded as, on the whole, a healthy one. Its chief sanitary characteristic, however, is, as before stated, the remarkably low death-rate for diarrhoea during the summer months. 84 The sanitary duties have, I think, been very diligently and satisfactorily performed by the inspectors during the year, from March 26th, 1879, to March 25th, 1880, inclusive. A reference to Table IV. will shew that during this period 11,164 houses have been inspected, most of them in the systematic house to house inspection, which has been zealously carried on ever since the commencement of the Vestry's operations in the year 1856. In connection with this visitation 3,712 Notices were served relating to works requiring to be done. Of these notices only 91 were uncomplied with at the end of the year; and again, in 45 cases only were summonses taken out in order to compel compliance with the Vestry's orders. This result is satisfactory, while shewing, on the one hand that those on whom notices have been served have been considerately dealt with, and on the other hand that they have been, for the most part, reasonably ready to carry out the work required of them. It is important also to observe that a large proportion of the summonses related to the disinfection of houses after Small-pox and Scarlet Fever, a duty which, for its effectual performance, requires to be carried out promptly. 1 do not know that it is necessary to call special Table IV.— RETURN OF WORKS CARRIED OUT FROM THE 26th MARCH, 1879, TO THE 25th MARCH, 1880, (inclusive).

It is important, however, to observe that 245 cases of Small-pox, 339 of Scarlet Fever, 25 of Fever, and 39 of Diphtheria were looked after by the inspectors during the course of the year; and that in 375 cases houses were disinfected under their superintendence. Table V. shews the number of articles disinfected in the parochial disinfecting machine. The lots amounted to 379, and these comprised 376 beds, 522 blankets, 149 sheets, 527 pillows, 148 mattresses, 35 palliasses, 272 bolsters, 225 counterpanes, and 99 articles of wearing apparel, in all 2,353 articles of various kinds. Besides these, 25 different articles of bedding were destroyed, at a cost to the Vestry of £4 6s. 6d. The amount of disinfection done, although considerable, is not equal to that of last year. This, however, depends on the diminished prevalence of Small-pox. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. S. BRISTOWE, 88 Measures to be adopted against the spread of Scarlet Fever and other Infectious Disorders. Precautionary Measures. 1.—All areas, basements, cellars, kitchens, and yards should be kept dry and clean, and if necessary, well lime-whited. 2.—All water-closets, sinks, and drains should be kept scrupulously clean, be regularly flushed with water, and have their traps in good order; they should also, if at all offensive, be kept flushed with solution of Sulphate of Iron or Carbolic Acid. 8.—All dust-bins should be emptied at least once a week, and no unnecessary or undue accumulations of offensive matters should be permitted anywhere. Such accumulation should (pending their removal) be disinfected by the free use of Chloride of Lime. 4.—All water-butts and cisterns should be kept clean and well covered. 5.—All houses, and especially the sleeping apartments, should be kept clean and well ventilated. G.—Overcrowding should be avoided as much as possible. 89 Measures to be taken when Fever of any kind is present. 1.—Every person suffering from Fever should be placed as early as possible under the care of a qualified Medical Practitioner. 2.—The patient should be at once separated, as efficiently as circumstances will permit, from the other inmates of the house, and if possible, should be placed in a top room. A sheet kept wet with a solution made by thoroughly mixing a quarter of a pint of Carbolic Acid, No. 4, with a gallon of water, should bo hung up outside the door. 8.—All bed-curtains and other hangings, and carpets, and all articles of dress, &c., in wardrobes and cupboards, should be removed from the room. 4.—The patient's room should be well ventilated, but not needlessly draughty: windows should be kept partially open, and the communication with the chimney free. A fire generally aids ventilation. 5.—Pieces of rag, being inexpensive, should be used for wiping discharges from the mouth and nose, and should be immediately burnt after use. 6.—A basin, containing Chloride of Lime or Condy's Fluid, or some of a solution made by dissolving a pound of Green Copperas in a gallon of water, should be kept at hand to receive the patient's spit or vomit. 7.—The discharges from the bowels and kidneys should bo received into vessels charged with the same disinfectants. 90 8.—A pail, also containing solution of Chloride of Lime, or of Condy's Fluid, or of Carbolic Acid, should stand in the room for the reception of all bed and body linen after removal from the person of the patient. 9.—All glasses, cups, and other utensils should be scrupulously cleaned before being used by others. 10.—The hands of the nurse should be washed with Carbolic Acid Soap, and rinsed in water containing Condy's Fluid; her dress should be of cotton. 11.—All articles of dress in use by the nurse or patient, and all articles of a like kind liable to be infected, should, before they are removed from the room in which the patient lies, be put into a solution of Chloride of Lime or Condy's Fluid, or Carbolic Acid, and should afterwards be washed and boiled, or burnt. 12.—The room should be thoroughly disinfected after it has been emptied. A good plan is to burn from a quarter to half a pound of brimstone in an iron dish, supported over a pail of water in the middle of the room, the door, windows, and other outlets having been previously closed. The room should remain closed for twenty-four hours. CAUTIONS. 1.—If any person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder, shall enter any public conveyance without previously notifying to the owner or driver thereof that he is so suffering, he shall be liablo to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. 91 2.—Any person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder who wilfully exposes himself, without proper precaution against spreading the said disorder, in any street, public place, or public conveyance, and any person in charge of one so suffering, who so exposes the sufferer, shall bo liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. 4 3.—Any owner or driver of a public conveyance who does not immediately provide for the disinfection of his conveyance after it has conveyed any such sufferer, shall be liable to a penalty not exceed Five Pounds. 4.—Any person who, without previous disinfection, gives, lends, sells, transmits, or exposes any bedding, clothing, rags, or other things that have been exposed to infection from such disorder, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. 5.—If any person knowingly lots any house, room, or part of a house in which a person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder has been, to any other person, without having such house, room, or part of a house, and all articles therein liable to retain infection, disinfected to the satisfaction of a qualified Medical Practitioner, as testified by a certificate given by him, such person shall be liable to a penalty not exceoding Twenty Pounds. 6.—When any dead body of one who has died of any infectious disease is retained in a room in which persons live or sleep, any Justico may, on a certificate signed by a legally qualified Medical Practitioner, order the body to be removed to a mortuary at the cost of the Nuisance authority. 92 NOTICES. 1.—If any Infectious Fever appears in any place, information should be at once given at the Vestry Hall to the Medical Officer, or to the Inspectors of Nuisances. 2.—Complaints as to Nuisances should be made personally or by letter to the Inspectors of Nuisances, and as to the Non-Removal of Dust to the Dust Superintendent at the Vestry Hall. 8.—Disinfectants may be had gratis on application to the Inspectors of Nuisances. 4.—A Disinfecting Apparatus has been provided by the Vestry at the Parish Stone Yard, Peckham Park Road, at which bedding and articles of apparel may be disinfected gratis, on application to the Inspectors of Nuisances. 5.—A Mortuary has been provided at Forest Hill Cemetery, whither dead bodies may be at once removed, and where they may remain until the time of burial, on application to the Inspectors of Nuisances. G.—An Ambulance, provided by the Board of Guardians, is kept at the Workhouse, and may bo had on application to the Relieving Officer, or, in his absence, to the Master at the Workhouse.

BERNAYS, Analyst under the Foods Adulteration Act, 1872. 95 VESTRY OF ST. GILES, CAMBERWELL. Quarterly Reports received from Dr. Bernays as Public Analyst, under the "adulteration of foods act," for the year ending Lady-day, 1880. Chemical Laboratory, St. Thomas's Hospital Medical and Surgical College. Midsummer, 1879. To the Vestry of St. Giles, Camberwell. Gentlemen, At the commencement of the present Quarter, the subject of Violet Powder was before the Lambeth Police Court. In spite of an able defence, we lost the case. But to shew that there was justification for my contention that Violet Powder is a drug, I may mention that Pereira states that starch is used as a dusting-powder, to absorb acrid secretions and to prevent excoriations. Mr. Squire, also, in his 96 panion to the British Pharmacopœia, 11th Edition, mentions, under the head of Amylum or Starch, as its medicinal property, "a good application to the face and hands when affected by cutaneous eruptions." In the form of Violet Powder, which is merely scented starch, it is useful to prevent the low inflammation that may be caused by the chafing of the skin. The argument I adduced was, that only under the head of Starch would Violet Powder be regarded as a drug. Dr. Redwood, however, proved to the satisfaction of the Magistrate that Violet Powder might be any drying powder, and so the case was dismissed, but without costs. As all first-class chemists sell scented starch under the head of Violet Powder, I would venture to advise that this article should only be purchased of such, and of the quality suggested. Sulphate of lime is but a poor substitute, on account of its defective absorbant properties. In the present Quarter, including two Violet 97 Powders which were analyzed expressly to meet a case, I have analyzed fifty-six articles. Of drugs I have examined three specimens. In my last Report I had to mention a very defective Tartar Emetic, containing only 28 per cent. of antimony. The two specimens taken by onr Inspectors this Quarter were fully up to the mark, and contained the proper quantity. But another Drug, No. 54, called Dilute Sulphuric Acid, does not contain the correct amount of sulphuric Acid. It contains too much, viz.:—16.85 per cent., instead of 12.42 per cent. I have recommended that the vendor should be informed that no further action should be taken. The sample is quite free from antimony and arsenic. Next to drugs, I may mention two Vinegars, both of which are perfectly free from sulphuric acid. Four samples of Ketchups have been analyzed. These have been found to vary greatly, as it is obvious that ketchup is now a generic name applicable to many condiments. Thus we may have a Mushroom Ketchup or a Walnut Ketchup. As long as a 98 Ketchup is free from animal ingredients, no notice can be taken of such an article, but it is quite proper to know something more of its nature. Common saltplays a most important part in all of them, amounting to as much as 7 per cent. None of them contained any metallic or animal impurities. Four Butters and four Lards were found free from adulteration. One of the Butters (51) bad evidently been exposed to alternations of temperature, as some portions were crystalline and bleached. Nevertheless the density brought it well into the class of Butters. The same fact, viz., freedom from adulteration, applies to eight Breads. But I must say that a practised eye would not have been satisfied with the appearance of Nos. 45 and 46, especially of the latter. The Milks analyzed were 21 in number. Four of these were adulterated with water, and one was skimmed. Several were more than suspicious. Partly owing to the weather and the fodder, many of the Milks were poor in cream, but no amount of rain will account for the diminution of solids notfat. All the most recent information upon the subject of Milk, makes it clear that the standard agreed upon amongst Analysts, is entirely in favour of the Vendor. If we 99 could only do away with the long interregnums in the taking of samples, we should soon succeed in raising the general sub-standard to our Milk standard. The children have been further remembered as to Sweets. Four varieties were found free from all adulteration. Two Porters and two Ales are the only remaining items upon which to report. As regards alcohol, they vary from 8¼ to ll3/5 per cent. I have nothing unfavourable to report against one, and the quantity I found insufficient to make sure of my strong suspicion. Michaelmas, 1879. Of twenty-one Milks analyzed by me during the present Quarter, eight were adulterated, and none with less than 10 per cent, of water. The other samples have proved to be of very high quality, both as regards cream and the solids not fat 100 According to the "Sale of Food and Drugs Act Amendment Act" of 1879, any street, or open place of public resort, shall be held to come within the meaning of Section XVII. of the principal Act, so that a difficulty is removed as to obtaining certain samples. The three samples of Condensed Milk answered to the general description, and their analysis and consequent respective value may be judged from the Certificates. To the poor these condensed milks are of much value, on account of the great evenness of composition. Four Fermented Liquors, in the shape of a Beer and three Porters have been brought under my notice. The beer was remarkably free from acidity; the porters are more full-bodied than usual. Under the Amendment Act, in determining whether an offence has been committed under Section VI. of the said Act, by selling, to the prejudice of the purchaser, Spirits not adulterated otherwise than by the admixture of water, it shall be a good defence to prove that such admixture has not reduced the spirit more than 25 degrees under proof for brandy, whisky, or rum, or 35 degrees under proof for gin. I 101 presume that spirits will again be subjected to investigation, and I hope so in the cause of temperance as diluted spirits lead to an increase of drinking and to the injury of the Revenue. The matter of chief interest this Quarter is the subject of Butter. I have analysed four samples, and I gave a Certificate as to the character of No. 74, which has proved to be of public interest. Certainly as regards appearance, taste, and smell, this butter was of first-rate quality. Considering, too, the perfect uniformity of the mixture and comparison with other samples, I ought not to have hesitated about passing it But then I should have judged without chemical analysis. When I reflect upon the melting point, the density, and the amount of fatty acids, I do not see how I could have acted differently. Amongst the charges made against me of carelessness, how unsubstantial these are, I can affirm with confidence when I remind you that the density was taken three times, and the melting point, in all, seven times. But, as the case is practically decided by Somerset House, I shall be obliged, in future, to alter the standard which I had adopted on the authority of Messrs. Hehner and Angell. Only one thing I wish to place distinctly upon record. It is a manifest injustice to chemists exercising the office of Public Analysts, that they g 102 should be thrown without reason. The mere statement that the Somerset House Chemists, without giving the results of analysis, should pronounce an article genuine, is an unheard-of feature of English justice. I therefore trust that the Vestry will support me in any future case, and will ask of the Magistrate an adjournment for further information. One of the butters only just came within the limits of the allowed quantity of salt. The Lards, four in number, were of good quality. They were totally free from metallic contamination. I have only examined two Breads, but both were of very good quality. The methods of analysis have been very much improved, and although they are more costly, they are more satisfactory in every way. Of Sweetmeats I have analyzed two specimens; a Mixture and Gum Pastilles. Both were of fair quality, coloured with harmless pigments and quite free from injurious characteristics. A crystalline powder, Sherbet, scarcely calls for remark. The effervescing part was somewhat under the usual proportion, but this is a matter of no importance. 103 Among condiments I may mention three Ketchups. They present extraordinary variety. One variety, No. 84, contains 22½ per cent. of salt; another, No. 95, only 4 per cent. The first would greatly promote thirst, but will keep; the second will not keep when once opened, and was soon filled with vibrios. From experience I should say that 10 per cent. of salt is about the necessary quantity. All the ketchups were free from animal matters and from metallic contaminations. As Lime Juice Cordials. are very much used, it was thought advisable to submit the varieties to analysis. Two of these have been examined and found of the character indicated. From the name, it must, however, not be inferred that they are cordials by reason of their alcoholic contents. They are wholesome and recommendable. With the mention of three kinds of drugs, Tartar Emetic (2), Epsom Salts, and Sulphate of Quinine, I bring my Report to a close. The Crystalline Tartar Emetic, No. 82, was perfect in composition ; No. 88, which was in powder, was not saturated as regards antimony. I may repeat reformer experience that there is no certainty of obtaining the genuine article unless well crystallized. 104 Christmas, 1879. By some mistake the unusual number of sixty-seven articles of consumption have been supplied during the last quarter, and I trust that a diminution will be made in The coming Quarter. I have analysed thirty-one samples of Milk, and of these no fewer than seven have been examined in duplicate. All of these seven were more or less adulterated with water. But, owing to the larger percentage of butter, no legal notice could with wisdom be taken of several of them. Besides these seven, one of them contained 18 per cent. of cream, doubtless a top-skimming. And yet another was skimmed so as almost to constitute a case for prosecution. Many of the milks were of excellent quality, and the same may be said of all the Breads, sixteen in number. Not one of the breads gave any indication of the presence of alum, nor did the microscope exhibit any admixtures. Besides milk and bread, I have examined one specimen of ground Coffee (123) which contained nearly 50 per cent. of chicory. Of Cocoas, three have been analysed. They were admixtures of the usual character, with added 105 sugar and starch. If the Public were well advised they would add these articles themselves. Four Lards, four Mustards, and eight Peppers conclude the list. The Lards were good. The mustards were not adulterated, but, in three cases, feeble from the absence of black mustard. One of the Peppers (136) contained 6½ per cent, of sand. It was very strong. I could not recommend a prosecution, as it was probably accidental. The certificates are all in the hands of the V Inspectors. Lady-day, 1880. During the Spring Quarter just passed, I have analyzed thirty-five samples of Milk, and I am sorry to say that there is a considerable amount of adulteration. It should be mentioned that many of these were afternoon-milks, and they consequently represent a branch of work that has not been hitherto, to any extent, undertaken No fewer than seventeen were more or less admixed with water, or say 48 per cent. One of these milks contained 50 per cent, of water, and was taken from a customer in order to ascertain the character of the article sold, inasmuch 106 as the Vendor would not supply one of our Inspectors. Thirteen of these milks have been analyzed in duplicate, so that really forty-eight analyses have been made of milk alone. Even when the chief constituents are only estimated, it is sometimes necessary to examine into the cause of the high specific gravity, and this involves additional work beyond that which was first expected. Two samples of Cacao have exhibited the extent to which a mixture can be brought. One of them did not contain more than 20 per cent, of Cacao; and the other differed very little. Cheapness does not make up for quality, as Arrowroot and Sugar cannot compensate for the nutritive part of genuine Cacao. Two samples of Coffee were both good, and left nothing to be desired. Six Breads and Three Lards were, as far as the Act is concerned, of the nature and quality demanded. One of the Breads was, however, very insufficiently fermented. A point, to which I called attention more than five years since, viz., deficiency of salt, is now no longer observable. Peppers, four in number, were of very good 107 quality. The same remark applies to three Mustards. Besides these fifty-five articles, I have analyzed a Water, and two Butters for inhabitants of the district. The two Butters were forwarded to me by a grocer who did not believe in their purity. On analysis they were shewn to consist almost entirely of butterine. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, ALBERT J. BERNAYS. The above Reports are submitted to the Vestry. (Signed) W R KEMP, Chairman to the Sewers and Sanitary Committee, 1879-80. T. L.

Dated this 19th day of July, 1880, and continued by adjournment until the 19th day of August, 1880. Wm. Taylor Poole, Charles Smith, Auditors of the James Russell, Parish of st. Giles, Camberwell. James Lawson, Thomas Youle. 157 Vestry Hall, Camberwell, August 19th, 1880. Gentlemen, Having audited the Vestry Rates and Accounts for the year ending 25th March, 1880, we duly sign and thereby certify their correctness, subject to the following observations. 1st.—The expenditure connected with the works of the Parish, consisting of minute details which could not be altogether satisfactorily checked by us, leaves a responsibility still existing upon those who have previously examined the accounts, which the audit does not relieve. 2nd.—We assume that the Overseers have only after due consideration, such as the various cases may have required, excused, either wholly4 or in part, the Vestry Rates in these many cases under our notice. 3rd.—We have observed instances where cheques have been drawn, payable to an Officer of the Vestry, for the payment of certain accounts that have not been examined and passed by the Finance Committee. We consider this irregular, and would in future prefer (Petty Cash excepted) that cheques 158 should be drawn for the exact amount of the accounts, and payable to the parties themselves. 4th.—We have surcharged accounts amounting to about £200, in consequence of their not being verified by the Committee. It has also come under our notice that one of the Clerks employed in the Accountant's Office has absconded, leaving defalcations to the amount of £98 0s. 6d. A bond covering the full amount has been produced to us, and we are informed that proceedings are pending for the recovery of the same. The movement for adopting the "Free Libraries Act" in this Parish has created an expenditure of £102 12s. 7d. out of the year's rates. We may add that the Clerks in the several Departments of the Vestry have rendered us every assistance during the audit. Wm.
