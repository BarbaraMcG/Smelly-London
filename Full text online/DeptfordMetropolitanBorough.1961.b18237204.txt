TIDeway 1360. June, 1962. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in reporting on the health and environmental circumstances of Deptford for 1961. A broad survey of vital statistics indicates continued general improvement throughout the Borough, although there is one aspect in relation to housing which deserves particular mention. Once again the population has declined although the Birth Rate has increased from 18.78 to 20.2. Infant deaths are reduced and the new Infantile Mortality Rate is 22.69. As a balance to the larger number of births it must be observed that the Death Rate also increased from 11.11 to 11.64. The main causes of death continue to be heart disease, especially coronary thrombosis, and malignancy with particular reference to neoplasm of lung and bronchus. It should also be noted that bronchitis accounted for a not inconsiderable number of deaths especially among the elderly. A study of mortality statistics over the last decade indicates that while diseases due to infection have been almost eliminated, the degenerative diseases and malignancy continue to increase. This is partly due to the larger numbers of the population reaching the age where these ailments are prevalent but there may be other genetic or environmental factors, as yet unexplained, to account for this undoubted trend. Notifications of Infectious Diseases increased from 388 to 1,553 of which figure Measles accounted for 1,400. There was little dysentery in the Borough but one case of diphtheria concerning a child attending a Deptford school was notified and I have included in the body of the report a full account of the action which this Department took in conjunction with the London County Council. Pulmonary Tuberculosis increased from 80 to 97. There were 13 new cases and 21 transferred cases at Carrington House and it is of some significance that one in seven of new cases emanated from this Common Lodging House. The Chest Physician, Dr. Rigby, has kindly contributed a brief outline of the work of the Chest Clinic. He mentions chronic bronchitis as a particular problem in Britain. No precise statistics are available since chronic bronchitis is not, of course, notifiable but a study of National Health claims indicates clearly the seriousness of this disabling condition. What are the underlying causes and how can the position be improved ? Nothing can be done about the climate but something could be done about improving the warmth and comfort of housing. Secondly, a drastic reduction in cigarette smoking would not only reduce bronchitis but reduce greatly the incidence of lung cancer. Thirdly, the removal of smoke and noxious irritants from the atmosphere would effect material improvement. These are measures which are within our immediate competence to apply. As far as atmospheric pollution is concerned, this Borough, in conjunction with other local authorities, is pressing ahead with a planned programme of smoke control areas and it is hoped that the whole Borough will be covered by smoke control areas by 1970. During the year, the No. 2 Order was confirmed and became operative on the 1st October. A word must now be said about housing. A dispassionate assessment of housing needs in this country shows a disquieting picture. Deptford, in comparison with other areas, has not a serious slum problem although a large proportion of our houses fall far short of modern standards. Housing is the hub around which all other branches of welfare services revolve. A decent house is the indispensable base from which a family can build a healthy and satisfying life. I understand it will take some cities 75 years to complete slum clearance at present progress and this takes no account of continuing deterioration of other properties. A high proportion of Deptford houses are obsolescent rather than actually slum and a good deal more could be done than is being done at present by some owners to improve properties by availing themselves of standard and discretionary improvement grants to provide such amenities as internal sanitation and a bath and hot water system. In a report of this nature, which is concerned with an impartial review of all known factors impinging on the health of all citizens of this Borough, the problem of houses in multiple occupation, or let in lodgings, must be discussed frankly and without any overt or hidden prejudices. Large houses are being bought in some areas and in some cases are being occupied greatly in excess of legal limits. In such houses amenities such as cooking and personal washing facilities are inadequate and, at times, primitive. Fortunately legislation is about to be enacted to enable local authorities to demand decent standards in most properties. It would be a tragedy if standards of hygiene and living conditions, built up laboriously over several decades and which, as yet, are not sufficiently high, were to be eroded or undermined by an insidious increase in unsatisfactory houses in multiple occupation. It is the business of the Health Department to demand the highest possible standards of conduct consistent with the law and the health of the community. No individual or section who maintain decent standards will receive anything but the help, encouragement and co-operation of the Health Department. The population continues to age and citizens over 65 years now constitute between 12 and 13% of the citizens of Deptford. The Council, accordingly, have extended the services provided for the old people. The number of visits paid to elderly persons increased from 3,677 in 1960 to 5,196 and collections of laundry from 3,838 to 4,058. It is of interest to note that the number of articles laundered was over 34,000 and baths at the Bathing Station and in the homes totalled 918. Once again it is a pleasant duty to record my thanks to the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Public Health Committee for their support, and to the staff of the Department I record my grateful thanks for their loyalty and diligence throughout the year. I remain, Your obedient Servant, John Kerr Brown, Medical Officer of Health. STAFF Medical Officer of Health J. Kerr Brown, B.Sc., M.B., ch.B., D.P.H. Public Analyst (part time) H.

The proportions of old or young vary in different areas and the Registrar-General gives Area Comparability factors which take these variations into account. The factor for births is 0.98 and for deaths 1.01 and the birth rate and death rate should be multiplied by the appropriate factor when making comparisons with rates in other towns. The figure for population is the estimated mid-year home population. The estimated decrease in the population is 1,110, whereas the number of births exceed the number of deaths by 572. The table setting out the causes of deaths will be found in the Appendix Table. I The deaths are classified under 36 headings based on the Abbreviated List of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death, 1948. Area of Borough 1,564 acres. Estimated mid-year home population 68,220 Live Births —Legitimate 1,212 Illegitimate 154 1,366 Live Birth Rate per 1,000 living population 20.02 Illegitimate live births per cent of total live births 11.27% Still Births—Legitimate 22 Illegitimate 4 26 Still Birth Rate per 1,000 (live and still births.) 18.68 Total Live and Still Births 1,392 Infant Deaths —Legitimate 26 Illegitimate 5 31 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births — total 22.69 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births — legitimate 21.45 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births — illegitimate 32.47 Neo-natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births (first four weeks) 17.57 Early Neo-natal Mortality Rate (Deaths under one week per 1,000 live births) 16.10 Perinatal Mortality Rate (Still births and deaths under one week combined 1,000 live and still births) 34.48 Maternal Deaths (including abortion) Maternal mortality rate per 1,000 live and still births — Total Deaths 794 Death Rate (per 1,000 living) 11.64 Section "B" INFECTIOUS DISEASES INFECTIOUS DISEASES General The total number of notifiable infectious diseases showed an increase of 1,165. This increase is more than accounted for by the fact that it was a "Measles year", 1,400 cases being notified as against 94 in the previous year. No cases of Poliomyelitis were actually notified in this Borough although two copies of notifications to the Medical Officer of Health for Lewisham were sent to me in relation to patients in the Hither Green Hospital whose home addresses were in Deptford. Similarly, four copies of hospital notifications in respect of cases of puerperal pyrexia were also received although only one case was notified directly to me. Infectious Diseases.

No cases of anthrax, cerebrospinal meningitis, diphtheria, meningococcal infection, smallpox or typhoid fever were notified during the year. Diphtheria—Edmund Waller School On the 11 th July notification was received of a case of Diphtheria (Mitis strain of moderate virulence) living in the Borough of Camberwell, who attended the Edmund Waller School, Waller Road, New Cross, S.E.14. She had been removed to Hither Green Hospital, S.E.13, and it was understood from the London County Council that she had not been immunised. The girl attended the Junior Mixed School which had approximately 600 children, including 170 in the Infants' School (which included the patient) to which the infection was confined. After consultation with the London County Council Divisional Medical Officer (Dr. Waldron) it was decided that the whole school should be swabbed (Nose and Throat). As a result of this swabbing, 13 carriers were found (11 living in Deptford and 2in Camberwell). The 11 Deptford carriers were removed to the Brook Hospital and the 2 Camberwell carriers to Hither Green Hospital. All the children present in the school at the time were given either a " booster " dose or a primary dose of Diphtheria Antigen (over 8 years T.A.F. 1 c.c., under 8 years F.T. 0.5) and the Public Health Department were given a list of absentees from the school. Parents and brothers and sisters of the positive carriers were given two Nose and Throat swabs. Parents under 30 years of age and children not immunised or given a " booster " dose in 1961 were immunised in accordance with the above antigens and dosage. Brothers and sisters of those children in the class where the actual clinical case was found were dealt with similarly. Absentee children were swabbed and immunised later in their own homes or by the family doctor. Further absentees from school were notified to us day by day by the London County Council and these were also visited, swabbed on two occasions and immunised in accordance with the above procedure. Special immunisation clinics were arranged in consultation with the London County Council on Thursdays, 20th and 27th July (afternoons and evenings) for those parents under 30 years of age and all brothers and sisters of absentee children in the school, both junior and infants, who had been notified to us. A circular letter was sent by this Department to households concerned and arrangements were made to follow up those absentees who were away from home owing to holidays or other reasons. We were given all the help that we required by the London County Council Divisional Health Department, and for two full days we had the services of at least two Health Visitors to assist us in the swabbing of the absentees. The rest of the work was undertaken with our own departmental resources. It was known that about 80 per cent of the school had been immunised previously and diphtheria anti-toxin was not used because of the possible danger of serum reaction in susceptible cases. It will be appreciated that only one clinical case had occurred and it was felt that in the absence of further cases developing it was safe to rely on the eventual efficacy of the active immunisation procedure adopted. It was also decided because of our limited resources —and the time factor—to dispense with the Schick testing of those parents to whom immunisation was offered. The age of 30 for parents to qualify for immunisation was chosen rather arbitrarily and has no special merit or significance. As a result of a second swabbing at the school, two further carriers were discovered and removed to the Brook Hospital. The very extensive swabbing of parents and contacts at home revealed negative results with the exception of a single case to which reference will be made subsequently. 10 A third round of swabbing was undertaken at the school on Monday, the 24th July, with negative results and the London County Council decided to postpone a fourth comprehensive swabbing until the school resumed after the summer vacation. No absentees were allowed back to school unless cleared by this Public Health Department but before issuing clearance certificates we had to be satisfied that two consecutive Nose and Throat swabs had been found negative, and that the child had had a recent primary or "booster" dose of Diphtheria Antigen. Special mention must be made of the parent who was found, on swabbing, to have Diphtheroid-like organism in her nose. It was reported as Non-toxigenic C. Diphtheriae Mitis and after consultation with the Bacteriologist at the Hither Green Hospital (Dr. Whelan) exhaustive virulence tests were applied to the culture. These confirmed the nonvirulence of the organism. Nasal swabbing was repeated three days later and the lady was referred to her own doctor for treatment with appropriate nasal antiseptic drops. This second nasal swabbing revealed the same organism which was subjected to the same rigorous virulence tests with negative results and we deemed it safe to allow her to remain at home. Nevertheless, she was given advice regarding elementary principles of hygiene and the case was visited regularly until the minor infection had cleared up. It was decided to disinfect the Infants' School and this was carried out by Formaldehyde spraying. Disinfection of houses and effects was available if required. We asked the Brook Hospital to advise us when the carriers were fit to be discharged in order that they could be kept under further surveillance for about another month. In these cases Nose and Throat swabs were taken at intervals of about one week until we obtained three consecutive negatives. As a result of the swabbing of the carriers after discharge from hospital, two subsequently gave positive swabs, and following school swabbing after the holidays, three further children were found to be positive. Three of these children were removed to hospital for treatment (one for the second time) and the other two were isolated at home and treated by their own doctors in consultation with the medical authorities at the Brook Hospital. All were eventually cleared and returned to school. I should like to stress the ready co-operation that I received from parents and the national and local press. Apart from a few inadvertent errors in reporting, I am satisfied that the press co-operated with us admirably and helped to create a climate of justifiable anxiety amongst responsible parents which made them all the more ready to accept and to seek protection for their children. It is also necessary in this report to acknowledge the magnificent help which we received from the Public Health Laboratory at Hither Green Hospital, S.E.13. They were receiving swabs at all hours and in large numbers and provisional results were always available within 18-24 hours and confirmed later. This service helped greatly in co-ordinating and planning the daily routine. 11 The lessons learned from this outbreak were first of all, that the large number of children already protected in the school undoubtedly prevented many clinical cases developing. Secondly, it emphasised the necessity for a painstaking and thorough search for potential sources of infection. Positive carriers were removed to isolation hospitals literally within an hour of receiving the laboratory report, and I am satisfied that this early removal of potential sources of infection from the community contributed materially to the damping down of the outbreak. Tuberculosis All new cases in the Borough, whether or not they are transferred from other areas, are visited by the Public Health Inspectors in order to ascertain the housing condition and to see if any improvements can, or should, be effected.

P. V. Rigby, for the following report concerning the Chest Clinic at Harton Street, which is of great interest:— Cases on Chest Clinic Register at 31.12.61:— Definite 1,058 Observation 36 Number of new contacts examined 346 Total attendance at the Chest Clinic 5,951 TUBERCULOSIS CARE COMMITTEE Interviews by Secretary 706 Cases assisted by Care Committee 20 Sums raised by Christmas Seal Sale, 1961 £68 13s. 7d. " It will be noticed that the total number of attendances at the Deptford Chest Clinic remains relatively high. A decline may have been expected owing to the known greater efficacy of treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis these days. The greater availability of out-patient treatment however, does itself tend to make for increased attendances. In other words, the 12 morbidity from tuberculosis remains relatively high, though the mortality is lowered. A fair number of people are being treated locally by antituberculous drugs at work or at home. Another major cause of continued activity at the Deptford Chest Clinic lies in the relatively large number of new patients referred to the department by General Practitioners for an opinion on the chest condition. At one time, the main request was to exclude pulmonary tuberculosis in a patient, but now a wide variety of general chest problems are referred to the Chest Clinic for investigation and treatment. It is important nowadays to exclude pulmonary new growths as there has been a national increase in this disease. Chronic bronchitis is also a local problem. This is sometimes referred to abroad as 'English Disease'. Despite modern drug treatment this remains a killing disease in all large cities, London especially, and the Deptford area is no exception. The tuberculosis figures do, in fact, remain relatively high in this area, possibly due to the presence of a large common lodging house in the vicinity with tuberculous males in it, but there have also been a number of cases of tuberculosis in immigrants. Deptford is not yet a smokeless zone and many of its inhabitants are also tobacco smokers. These factors undoubtedly aggravate chest diseases in the area, as elsewhere. In the beginning of 1962, there are signs that the recent medical reports on smoking are having at least a local effect, in that hardened cigarette smokers are reducing the total amount smoked." Mass Miniature Radiography I append below a report I have received from the Director of the Mass Radiography Unit: " I enclose analyses of results of surveys carried out during 1961 as promised. As you will see, out of a total of 4,972, 3,083 were X-rayed at New Cross Hospital during our regular Friday surveys. Out of this total of 3,083, 12 cases were found and of these 12 cases, 7 were found amongst people not previously X-rayed. The other surveys during the year were carried out at Deptford (Car Park) and Brockley Station (General Public); and at Goldsmiths, Tucker and Richardson and Carrington House." 13 Analysis of Results of Survey carried out at Deptford during the Year 1961 (including general public, factories and colleges) Women General Analysis Men Total Part I 1,987 (a) Total X-rayed 2,985 4,972 (b) Total previously mass X-rayed within five years 2,132 1,033 3,165 (c) Total reviewed (considered possibly abnormal at first reading 80 177 257 (d) Considered abnormal after review 47 130 177 (e) Failed to attend for large film 1 - 1 Part II (1) Cases considered tuberculous and referred for further investigation: (a) No further action required - - - (b) Occasional supervision 8 5 13 (c) Requiring close supervision or treatment 5 9 14 2 2 (d) Still under investigation - (e) Refused further investigation - - - (2) Previously known tubercular cases 10 8 18 (3) Non-tuberculous cases: 9 (a) Investigated 30 39 (b) Still under investigation 4 2 6 (4) Cardio vascular lesions 6 7 13 (5) Abnormalities requiring no action 61 11 72 Section "C" SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES ETC., AND FACTORIES ACT 16 SANITARY INSPECTION General The total number of primary inspections carried out by the district public health inspectors fell from 4,941 in 1960 to 4,256. Complaints were fewer than the year before, 1,178 as against 1,230. Responsibility for factory inspection now rests with the Clean Air Officer and consequently only 22 factory visits were made by district inspectors compared with 64 in the previous year. Also, owing to the detachment of Mr. Waring to Clean Air duties and Mr. Allen to whole-time Food and Drugs work, the districts had to be enlarged. Fortunately, we were able to engage an additional inspector (Mr. Iggulden) in August, and this eased matters to some extent. At the end of the year, however, we were still one Inspector short of the normal establishment. Two student inspectors are employed and, together with a member of the clerical staff, are under training for the Public Health Inspectors' examination but it will be some time before any of them become qualified. Defects found were dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, the London County Council (General Powers) Acts and the London County Council Bye-Laws. Rodent Control Two rodent operators were employed throughout the year under the general direction of the Chief Public Health Inspector, and the following tables summarise the work carried out: — 17 PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Report for the Year ended 31st December, 1961 Type of Property Non-Agricultural (4) Total of Cols.

Number of patients 80 Number of collections and deliveries 4,058 Number of articles cleansed 34,609 These figures show an increase in the number of collections and deliveries of 720 and in the number of articles cleansed 13,161. Water Supply The water supply for domestic purposes for the whole of the Borough is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. Routine bacteriological examination is not normally carried out by the Council but the Water Board have supplied information on the bacteriological purity when requested. 21 The water supply has been fully satisfactory throughout the year. Certificates in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, that dwelling houses had a proper and sufficient water supply were issued in respect of 355 new premises. All dwelling houses in the Borough have water supply direct to the house and none are supplied from standpipes. Clean Air Act, 1956 On the Ist October, 1961, the second Smoke Control Area in the Borough came into operation. This is a large area covering 267 acres and including 3,955 dwellings, 19 industrial premises, 63 commercial undertakings and 12 others. All the conversions in this area were under the supervision of Mr. Waring, the Council's Clean Air Officer. During the early part of the year the Clean Air staff were also engaged in the inspection of houses in the proposed No. 3 Smoke Control Area which was confirmed by the Minister early in 1962. This area covers 200 acres and includes 2,907 dwellings, 40 industrial premises, 215 commercial premises and 17 others. Mr. Waring's inspections and visits during 1961 are summarised as follows:— Smoke Control Order Inspections 2,903 Smoke observations Factory visits 864 633 4,400 A station for measuring atmospheric pollution is set up in the Public Health Department buildings and results and details are sent to the Warren Spring Laboratory of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Sewerage and Sewage Disposal Sewage disposal is by means of Borough Council and County Council sewers and is perfectly adequate. 22 Factories Act, 1937 1.

Section "E" HOUSING 28 HOUSING At the end of 1961 the Council had 1,470 permanent houses, maisonettes and flats, and 170 temporary houses of various types. Included in the total of 1,470 are 146 properties which have been acquired by the Council and which house 223 family units. During the year, 130 flats and maisonettes were completed for the Council. Also, 1,813 improvements were carried out in 641 houses, rather less than last year, and outstanding works at the end of the year totalled 59. Apart from the flats completed by the Council, 197 flats were completed by the London County Council, and 28 houses by private builders. In the maintenance of existing property the following is a summary of the work done in 1960: — Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Total number of houses inspected for housing defects 1,178 Number of Statutory Notices served 215 Number of houses repaired or nuisances remedied 641 HOUSING ACT, 1957 Closing Orders on basements of 18 houses were made by the Council but two were subsequently determined, the owners having made the rooms fit. Closing Orders were also determined in the case of a house with two attic rooms which were closed in 1937. The rooms had been made fit. Closing Orders were made in respect of three houses which are included in an area which is to be cleared by the L.C.C. towards the end of 1962. Underground Rooms Regulations In October the Council made Regulations under Section 18 of the Housing Act, 1957, for securing the proper ventilation and lighting of underground rooms and for the protection thereof against dampness, effluvia or exhalation. The consent of the Minister of Housing and Local Government was given to the Regulations on the 20th December, 1961. 29 RENT ACT, 1957.

Waldron) are at St. Paul's House, Deptford High Street, S.E.8, and the services which are provided by the London County Council at the various clinics are as follows: — Health Centre, Amersham Road, S.E. 14. Infant Welfare, Toddlers, and Ante-Natal Clinics. Artificial Sunlight, Simple Massage and Exercises Clinic. Special Investigation (Children Only) Clinic. Foot Clinic. Day Nursery. Mothercraft (Educational Sessions). Domestic Help Service, Vaccination and Immunisation. St. Luke's Hall, Gosterwood Street, S.E.8. Infant Welfare Clinic.

Welfare Foods Service National Welfare Food items are available for issue at the Health Centre, Amersham Road; Princess Louise Institute Clinic and St. Luke's Hall Clinic at certain times. These items are also available at 74 Deptford High Street, S.E.8 and the Women's Voluntary Services, 302 New Cross Road, S.E. 14. Section "G" MISCELLANEOUS 34 MISCELLANEOUS Canal Boats Act The section of the Grand Surrey Canal passing through the Borough was kept under observation by the District Inspector but no canal boats were found of a type requiring inspection. Common Lodging Houses There is only one Common Lodging House in the Borough. This is Carrington House which is maintained by the London County Council. This building was erected in 1903 and it contains 814 separate cubicles, for use by men only. In addition to the usual facilities for washing and bathing, there is a reading room and a smoking room. The dining room is provided with a large stove on which the men can cook their own meals, and in addition, there is a canteen which provides excellent meals at a low price. A sick bay is provided on the ground floor for cases awaiting admission to hospital. No nursing of any sort is provided but sick persons are not so isolated as they would be in cubicles on an upper floor, and serious or dangerous illness is less likely to be overlooked. The standard of accommodation is high and it compares favourably with many of the rooms occupied by single elderly men throughout the district. Laboratory Service Food samples are usually sent to the Medical Research Laboratory at County Hall, but clinical items, e.g., faeces specimens, continue to be sent to the Park Hospital Laboratories. The facilities at the Devonport Laboratory, Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, are occasionally used by general practitioners for the examination of swabs and other specimens. Mortuary The mortuary at Watson Street, Deptford, serves parts of Greenwich and Woolwich, in addition to Deptford. The number of bodies received at the mortuary is, as a result of this arrangement, greatly increased. The total number of bodies received during 1961 was 557, of which 237 were received from Greenwich, and 234 from Woolwich. A fee of £1 1s. Od. per body is paid by the Greenwich and Woolwich Borough Councils in respect of these admissions. National Assistance Act, 1948 Burial of the Dead Under Section 50 of the above Act it is the duty of the Council to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who dies or is found dead within the Borough, and where no private arrangements are made for the disposal of the remains. 35 Seven persons were buried under the provisions of this Act during 1961. Removal of Aged and Infirm Persons to Institutions Section 47 of this Act provides for procuring the necessary care and attention for the aged and chronic sick by means of an order of the Court. Several cases were removed either to hospital or County Council homes for the aged after persuasion, but it was not necessary to invoke Section 47 during the year. Services for Old People During the year two lady visitors were engaged in visiting the old people and dealing with their health and welfare problems. Six hundred and twelve old people were visited and these are mainly old folk to whom the attention of the Department has been drawn in one way or another, e.g. medical practitioners, district nurses, home help organisations, etc. Close co-operation is maintained with the Deptford Old People's Welfare Association in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of visits. A total number of 5,196 visits were paid during the year (Miss Ellison 2,881, Miss Smith 2,315), an increase of 1,519 over the previous year. This increase was partially due to the fact that Miss Smith was engaged for a full year for the first time. Home baths were started and an additional bathing station attendant engaged, and during the year 613 old people were bathed in their homes and 305 at the Bathing Station. Ninety-nine old people on our register died during the year and a further 60 were admitted to hospitals or homes. Thirteen removed from the Borough and 12 were deleted from the list on transfer to other organisations' visiting lists. At the end of the year 428 people were on the active list of our visitors. The laundry service for the aged and incontinent was greatly improved during the year and details of the service are shewn in the Laundry section of Section " C " of this Report. The Voluntary Services in the district provide some assistance and recreation for old people. The W.V.S. have organised five " Darby and Joan Clubs in various parts of the Borough so that one or more is within reasonable reach of persons living in any part of the district. In addition, the Albany Institute Old People's Club, although situated just beyond the Borough boundary, is patronised mainly be Deptford people. A " Meals on Wheels " service is carried out in co-operation with the Women's Voluntary Services Organisation. Meals are provided to over 300 old people each week. The meals are obtained from a local restaurant at a cost of 2s. per meal, for which the individuals pay Is. and the London County Council pay a subsidy of Is. per meal. 24,365 meals were provided during the year. 36 The Deptford Borough Council maintains three vehicles and provides two part-time drivers to deliver meals to house-bound old folk and the remainder of the meals to " Darby and Joan " clubs. The W.V.S. provide the helpers for the delivery of meals. Shops Act, 1950 In the course of their routine inspection the Public Health Inspectors paid attention to the ventilation and temperature of shops and the provision of washing accommodation and sanitary conveniences. Baths and Wash-Houses The Council maintains three swimming baths at Laurie Grove adjoining the Town Hall. A plant giving continuous filtration and sterilisation maintains the purity of the water at all times. The plant is capable of filtering the whole of the water in the baths within four hours and the system of " break-point" chlorination ensures the purity and safety of the water even during periods of maximum use. Two of the swimming baths are open all the year, but the large bath is closed from October until April, during which time a sprung floor is put in place and the building is used as a hall. In addition to the swimming baths there are 60 slipper baths for public use at Laurie Grove. At the Evelyn Baths, Clyde Street, there are 60 slipper baths and facilities for Russian Vapour Baths and Foam Baths, and in addition a public wash-house is provided. At the baths at Ilderton Road 18 slipper baths are provided. Pet Animals Act Eight applications for licences were received, and all were approved by the Council and granted. Medical Examinations During the year 37 examinations were carried out to ascertain if people appointed to the Council's Permanent Staff were fit for admission to the Superannuation Scheme. Forty-two examinations of sick employees were also made during the year and reports submitted thereon. Registration of Hairdressers' Premises Fifty-eight premises are registered under Section 18(1) of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954. Occasional inspections are made to ensure that the bye-laws are observed. Vaccination Certificates Two hundred and fifteen certificates by Medical Practitioners in respect of people travelling abroad were authenticated. 37 Conferences The Council was represented at Conferences during the year as follows: Royal Society for Promotion of Health —Blackpool The Chairman of the Public Health Committee (Councillor R. S. Marriott, J.P.). National Society for Clean Air—Brighton Councillor Mrs. A. M. Ott; Mr. J. E. Waring, Public Health Inspector (Clean Air Officer). Public Health Inspectors' Association—Bournemouth The Chairman of the Public Health Committee; Mr. H. E. Green, Chief Public Health Inspector.
