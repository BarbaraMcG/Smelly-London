LONDON; The Avenue Press, Ltd., Stratford, E., and and 8, bouverie street, e.c. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, TOWN HALL, WEST HAM. To the Council of the County Borough of West Ham. Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, "Every Medical Officer of Health appointed under the Public Health Act is required by order of the Local Government Board to make an annual report with regard to the sanitary district which is under his superintendence. The report is to be for the year ending 31st December. It should be chiefly concerned with the conditions affecting health in the district, and of any improvement or deterioration which may have occurred during the year in those circumstances." In accordance with the above requirement, I beg to submit my annual report for the year 1910, and in doing so, desire to point out that such report must necessarily consist very largely of a summary of my periodical reports and other matters which have been under discussion by the Council during the year, and which, therefore, are more or less within the immediate recollection of the members, The collated returns, however, and the statement of local circumstances which may appear superfluous to members fully conversant with them, serve not only as valuable statistical records for future reference, but are needed by the Local Government Board and other authorities, to whom the Medical Officer of Health is required to forward copies. I am, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, CHARLES SANDERS, Medical Officer of Health. a 2 4 Physical Features and General Character of the District.—West Ham is situate in latitude 51° 30' to 51° 33' N., and longitude 0° to 1' W., to 0° 3' E., on the extreme west of the County of Essex, and on the eastern side of the administrative County of London, from which it is separated by the windings of the River Lee and Bow Creek for 3½ miles. In shape it is an irregular rhomboid, some 2 miles from west to east and 4 miles from north to south, comprising within its boundaries 4,706 acres. The northern and eastern sides of the Borough are contiguous to the populated districts of Leyton and East Ham. The southern boundary is formed by the River Thames for 2 1/8 miles. In elevation it is almost flat, varying from less than 5ft. to 45ft. above ordnance datum, about half of the area being not more than 10ft. above that level. Chalk may be reached at depths varying from 100ft. to 150ft., overlaid by green Thanet sands and Woolwich beds, on which rests 5ft. to 50ft. of London clay. In the north-eastern half of the Borough 16ft. to 20ft. of river drift gravel overlays the London clay, sloping down towards the River Lee and River Thames into marshy clay and alluvium, a large part of the immediate surface being made ground. 5 METEOROLOGY. The observations given below are extracted from the weekly reports of observations taken at Greenwich Observatory, a course justified by the geographical position of the Borough immediately to the North of Greenwich. They show that the registered sunshine of the year was 1,379.3 hours, being 2614 hours less than in 1909. The hottest day was 20th June, when the temperature reached 82.2 degrees, and the coldest day was 27th January, when it sank to 20.3 degrees. The number of rainy days was 191, the total rainfall of the year being 28.06 inches. The greatest daily fall occurred on 16th April, when 1.50 inches fell. Meteorology during 1910.

Milk Supply.—Under the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Orders, 316 premises were on the Register for the sale of Milk at the commencement of the year, the majority of these being small general shops retailing very small quantities of milk, the storage of which is frequently of a doubtful character. On inspection, 64 were found to require cleansing or to exhibit defects remediable under the Public Health Acts. 17 milkshops were struck off the Register and 36 placed thereon during the year. In addition to the above, the Register contained the names of 18 persons registered as cowkeepers. 105 visits were paid to the cowsheds of these persons, and in several cases notices to cleanse or remedy structural defects were served upon the cowkeepers. Most of the cowsheds were kept in a fairly clean state, but there is still much room for improvement in some, both in the character of the buildings and in the care exercised in the collection and distribution of the milk. With a view to the detection of Tuberculosis of the Udder, prior to the year 1908, an annual inspection of all cows in the Borough was made by the Council's Veterinary Surgeon, but in that year the Council, on the advice of the Medical Officer of Health, decided that a quarterly inspection should be made. 8 I append below Mr. Glover's reports for the year 1910 :— Examination of Cows for Tuberculosis of the Udder Veterinary Surgeon's Report.

The cows were generally healthy, and no 9 one required a second visit. Of about 50 new cows there were a few cases of udder congestion, clearly due to chili. A large number had skin trouble, the result of severe winter conditions and non-parasitic. June Report.—The cows were generally in good health. There were no instances of emaciation and very little coughing. Those belonging to Anne Street, Thomas Street, Blind Lane and Camel Road were at pasture. About 50 new cows had come in during the three months. Two of these had ordinary mastitis. Cases of indu rated quarters previously noted remained dr}-. Beyond the twoabove mentioned, there were no cases calling for the withholding of the milk from sale. September Report.—There are now no cows at Warmington Street, Mr. Willis having given up cow-keeping entirely. The cows belonging to Camel Road, Anne Street, Thomas Street and Blind Lane were out at pasture. The animals were, in nearly all cases, in good health and condition. There were a very few instances of simple acute mastitis, and in these the little milk given could not be mixed with the other milk without spoiling it. Wherever there was a "dead" quarter the other sections of the udder were free from any symptom of tubercle. December Report.—The cows were generally in excellent health— a few coughing, but these with no clinical indications, local or general, of tuberculosis. Cows which carried little flesh were in all cases heavy milkers with sound udders. Three cases in new cows of inflamed quarters were clearly due to chills, and satisfactory assurances were given that the small quantity of milk yielded was not mixed with the bulk. RICHARD GLOVER, F.R.C.V.S. Chief Occupations of Inhabitants.—West Ham is a typical industrial Borough. Large factories abound on the river frontages west and south, railway works employing thousands of regular hands are located in the north, and large docks—the staple 10 support of casual labour—intersect the south. The 'rest of the area may be said to form the dormitory of artizans, clerks, and others> whose daily work is carried on in London, together with the local shops and retail businesses necessary for the welfare of their families. There is no particular industry calculated to specially affect the public health. Housing Accommodation.—The dedicated roads of the Borough extend to 123¾ miles, some four-fifths of which are at least 40ft. wide, and are bordered by houses of two storeys. Originally constructed as self-contained houses, they have, in a large measure, been adapted by alterations and additions for the accommodation of two families, while in recent years the flat system has been generally adopted in developing the newer estates. Very few blocks of dwellings of three or more storeys exist, and the unsatisfactory character of these give rise to the need for constant supervision and action by the Sanitary Staff. The erection of all new buildings are supervised by Building Inspectors of the Borough Engineer's Department. At the census in 1901 there were 41,368 inhabited houses in the Borough, and a house-to house visitation of these is regularly carried out. During the year 1910 the number of dwelling-houses inspected was 13,895, while, in addition, 2,891 were visited on account of infectious disease. The following 27 houses, viz.:—15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 18, 20, 22, 24, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, Marten Road, Victoria Docks, were visited under the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act during the year. They had been reported under the Housing of the W orking Classes Act, 1890, on the 25th November, 1909, but in view of the passing of the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act they were officially represented to the Public Health Committee as being in a state so dangerous to health as to be unfit for human 11 habitation, on the 8th June, 1910. The whole of the houses were at that time empty, and became dilapidated through the action of trespassers and others who obtained access by reason of want of proper protection. On the 22nd June, notice having been given to the owners to attend, the Public Health Committee considered the desirability of recommending the Council to make a Closing Order in respect of the houses in question. The owners did not attend, and on the 28th June on the recommendation of the Public Health Committee the Council made a Closing Order in respect of each of the houses. During the course of these proceedings the houses became in such a dangerous condition that the Borough Engineer on the instructions of the Committee boarded the whole of them in. On the 20th July the Town Clerk reported that notice of appeal against the Closing Order had been made to the Local Government Board, but this appeal was not proceeded with. On the 19th October the Medical Officer of Health reported that the Closing Order had been operative for three months and that the houses had not been rendered fit, whereupon notices were served upon the owners of the intention of the Council to consider the making of a Demolition Order in respect of the premises in question and to hear the owners thereof at their first meeting in December. On the 7th December the Public Health Committee reported that a letter had been received from the owner of the houses stating that he had sold the property, and also that a letter had been received from the new owner stating that he would proceed with the work of carrying out the requisite repairs to the property, and the matter was adjourned until 4th January, 1911. 12 Local Government Board Orders.—During the year the Local Government Board issued the following Orders and Memoranda:— In May a memorandum under the Sale of Food and DrugsAct relating to the sale of lard substitutes, of the presence of water in lard substitutes, and of the presence of paraffin in lard, lard substitutes, and lard margarine. On the 15th August.—Diphtheria Anti-toxin (Outside London) Order, 1910, as to the keeping, distribution, and use of anti-toxin. Housing, Town Planning, &c.. Act.—On the 11th January.— Rules with reference to appeals. On the 11th January. — Order prescribing the forms of notices, &c. On the 3rd May.—Procedure regulations. On the 2nd September.—Regulations under Section 17 (1). On the 10th November.—An Order as to the destruction of rats and Regulations as to plague. On the 29th November.—Port of London Authority published in "London Gazette" bye-laws for the prevention of plague amongst rats at the docks, prescribing measures to prevent the access of rats from vessels to the shore. On the 13th December.—The Sanitary Officers (Outside London) Order, 1910, relating to the appointment, &c., of Medical Officers of Health and Inspectors of Nuisances. On the 23rd December.—Circular letter to Medical Officers of Health, under the General Order, relating to the weekly return of notifications of infectious disease. 13 Food Inspection.—Each of the twelve Inspectors is required to inspect the food shops and slaughter-houses in his district. In addition to these, the Food Inspector, who devotes the greater part of his time to the administration of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, is charged equally with the other Inspectors with the duty of safeguarding the sale of food in market streets and other premises where dietary articles are exposed for sale. In the appendix to this report will be found a list of unsound food seized as unfit and unwholesome at its time of exposure for sale or condemned without formal seizure under Section 117, Public Health Act, 1875. During the year 1910 legal proceedings were instituted in three cases under the above section. In the first case the defendant was charged with depositing for the purpose of preparation for sale two pieces of unsound bacon, but the summons was dismissed. In the second case the defendant was charged with exposing for sale in his shop 22 tins of unsound condensed milk, and was fined £5. In the third case the defendant was charged with depositing for sale nine pints of unsound shrimps, and the Magistrate imposed a penalty of £2. Inspection of Bakehouses and Fishshops.—This is also carried out by the Inspectors, particular attention being directed to the regular refnoval of offal and trade refuse, which in all cases (except that of greengrocers) is carried out by private contractors. An application for sanction to a new bakehouse at 48, Upton Lane, was not entertained. Slaughter-houses.—There are now upon the Register 16 old registered slaughter-houses and one registered knacker's yard, together with 15 annually licensed slaughter-houses and one annually licensed knacker's yard. Owing to the proximity to the London market the amount of slaughtering carried out locally forms a small 14 percentage of the meat sold, but the infrequency of use and scattered location of the private slaughter-house render efficient inspection extremely difficult and very unsatisfactory. The difficulties and possibilities in this connection are peculiarly emphasized by a full statement of the facts in connection with the death of a cow in a cowshed in Whitechapel. It appears that on Saturday, October 15th, at about 12 o'clock noon, a telephonic message was sent by Mr. Harrison, L.C.C. Inspector of Cowsheds, to the Medical Officer of Health for Stepney, to the effect that a cow had died in a cowshed occupied by David Galinsky, of 64, Pelham Street, Whitechapel, and that one—King—a butcher, of Burdett Road, was taking the carcase. Mr. H. Abson, the Inspector of Nuisances for Stepney, was instructed to take the matter in hand, and his statement on the matter is as follows:— I arrived at the cowshed about 12.30 p.m., and found that Mr. Galinsky was out, but Mrs. Galinsky was there. After telling her who I was I asked her if they had had a cow die there that morning, and that I wished to see it. She replied, "That they had had a cow which had been taken away." I I asked her where it had been taken and by whom. She said, "I do not know anything about it, it has upset me so, it was all over in about two minutes. It was dead before I could get the rod down to clear the mangel out of its throat. Mr. Galinsky will be back soon, he has just gone out with a friend, but will not be long." I went into the cowshed and found blood over the gully there. I was told by Mrs. Galinsky that it was there that it was bled. She went on to say that Mr. Harrison came soon after it was over, but it had upset her so that I had better see Mr. Galinsky. I waited in vain about fifteen minutes for Mr. Galinsky to return, and then told Mrs. Galinsky that I must go, and that when Mr. Galinsky came in would she ask him to wait in for me. This she agreed to do. I then went, arriving about 1.20 at the butcher's shop, 97,. Burdett Road, occupied by Richard King, and asked for King. I was informed by a lady behind the counter and the shopman 15 that Mr. King was out, they did not know where he was, but they expected him back any time now. I asked the shopman where they slaughtered. He said, "At Plaistow," and on further questioning him, he said, "At Chadwin Road, at the back of the Abbey Arms." I then proceeded to Plaistow, and arrived at the slaughterhouse about 2.30, and found in the slaughter-house a man named Albert Knightbridge and Richard King. There was also a carcase of a cow lying on the floor. I first asked Knightbridge if he had had anything to do with the dressing of the carcase. He replied, "No, sir, I have only just come in." I then asked King what he was doing with the carcase there. He said, "It is not for food." I said, "That remains to be found out." I asked him where he got it from. He said," It came from Whitechapel that morning." I said, " Is this the one from Galinsky's?" He said "Yes." I then made an examination of the carcase and organs, and found the carcase was that of a cow about seven or eight years old. It had not been cut down into sides as in the usual way but had been divided across the vertebrae, and between the eleventh and twelfth ribs. The lungs and heart were still in the thoracic cavity. I found that it was extensively diseased with tuberculosis of the lungs and the parietal pleura. The whole of the mesenteric glands were greatly enlarged and full of tubercular material. The liver contained flukes. Apart from these conditions, and clear evidence of choking in the form of watery, swollen and broken down condition of the lymphathic glands, paleness and friability of the kidneys, friability of liver, and distension of the muscle cells, and the general paleness of the carcase some parts might have been passed, as it was a case of localised tuberculosis. That is, if it had be slaughtered in the ordinary way. King informed me that be had sent to Harrison & Barber's to take it away. 16 I ordered him to leave it where it was and said "I am going to the West Ham Town Hall, and it will be advisable for you to accompany me." He did so. At the Town Hall I asked the Caretaker for any of the Inspectors, but was informed that they were all away and the office closed. King now said to me, "Do you want the Inspector?" I said "Yes." He said, "I think I know where he lives." I replied " Then come along and show me." We arrived at Inspector Bannington's, and in his house I briefly gave him the history of the case, afterwards we all three proceeded to the slaughter-house in Chadwin Road. Mr. Bannington seized the carcase and had it removed to the Town Hall. Before the carcase was seized, Mr. Bannington and I questioned King as to the price he paid for it. He said he had not paid anything, but had brought it away on the understanding with Galinsky that he would do the best he could for him. He said he was sent for by Galinsky, and on his arrival at the cowshed he found the cow dead, and he at once cut its throat. He said it had been dead ten minutes. On being asked by Mr. Bannington why he did not come and inform him of the carcase (seeing that he had previously had asked him to do so in all cases), he replied, "If Mr. Abson had not come so soon I should have come across to your place." On Monday, October 17th, I interviewed Mr. King at his shop in Burdett Road, and asked him if he had dealt with Galinsky before. He said, "Yes, many times, the last was about three months ago, when I bought one for £14 or £15 10s." I said to him, "How did you arrange and settle the transaction." He replied, "I paid for it at once, I wrote him a cheque at the time of seeing the cow." He also said that when he cut the cow in the cowshed she flinched. (Previously he said she had been dead ten minutes.) During my visit to No 64, Pelham Street, on Saturday, October 15th, Mrs. Galinsky informed me that when Mr. Harrison was there he said that the cow was a good fat one, and she would be fit for food. On the following day, at the same premises, Mr. Galinsky made a similar statement. 17 On Monday, the day following, I met Mr. Harrison and he denied having made such a statement, or having made any expression of approval or permission for the carcase to be used for human food, adding that when Mrs. Galinsky told him that it had been dead only ten minutes he did not believe her statement, basing his opinion on the facts that the whole of the blood was coagulated and cold. On the same day, Monday, October 17th, 1 interviewed Richard King at his shop in Burdett Road, and asked him whether anything was said to him (when he was called in by Galinsky to deal with the carcase) about any Inspector having seen the carcase (before him) and saying that it would be fit for food. His answer was, "No." I then asked him very plainly if, when he arrived at Galinsky's did "Mr. or Mrs. Galinsky say anything to you about Mr. Harrison, the L.C.G. Inspector, having been there and saying that the carcase was fit for food." His reply was, "Not a word was said to me about any Inspector having been there." The action taken by the Inspector of Nuisances for West Ham is given in the following statement:— In consequence of information received from Meat Inspector Herbert Abson, of Stepney, I visited, in his company, the slaughter-house in Chadwin Road, occupied by Mr. Richard King, of 97, Burdett Road, at 3.30 on Saturday afternoon last. There I found the carcase of a cow, with skin, head, udders, runners, and liver removed, but lying, in slaughterhouse opened and divided in two parts just below the diaphragm. The carcase was thin and watery and badly infected with tubercle. I found Albert Knightsbridge, 11, Egham Road, employed by Mr. King (who had accompanied Mr. Abson to my house) on the premises. Mr. King informed me that he got the cow from Galinsky's, cowkeeper, 64, Pelham Street, Whitechapel, where he had been called in during the morning on account of the cow choking itself with a large piece of turnip. He informed me that he bled the carcase, and promised Galinsky that he would do what he could for him. b 18 He brought thecal case to the slaughter-house (about noon) and himself dressed it, as found by Mr. Abson, who, acting on information received, had followed the carcase up. Mr. King informs me that when he cut the carcase down and found the condition of it, he skinned it and sent a message to Harrison & Barber's. A man from this place came with float about 3.55. I seized the whole of the carcase, leaving the hide, and brought it to the Town Hall. Proceedings were instituted for depositing the carcase for the purpose of preparation for sale as food, with the result that a fine of £20 was imposed. The whole of the above facts were reported to the Council as shewing one of the evils of the private slaughter-house system, and as also exhibiting the value of three Local Authorities acting in concert with the result that the Public Health Committees of both the London County Council and the Stepney Borough Council were thanked for their co-operation in the matter. During the year Messrs. Harrison, Barber & Co., Ltd, applied for a license to slaughter horses, for exportation, at premises, 35, Normandy Street, originally occupied by them, and this application was granted. Mr. Benjamin Waddington, of 32, Stuart Road, Peckham, also applied to use the slaughter-house previously used by Messrs. A. Towers & Co., in Barbers Road. This was granted, subject to some necessary work being carried out to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.—Although each Inspector of Nuisances is required by the terms of his appointment to take samples if necessary under the above Acts, a special Inspector is appointed ad hoc to devote the greater part of his time to carrying out the duties imposed by their provisions on the Council. 19 Under these Acts 1,258 samples were purchased for analysis, and 119 were returned by the Public Analyst as adulterated, the number of samples taken being at the rate of 4'7 per 1,000 of the census population. In London the samples taken during the year 1909 were at the rate of 5.4 per 1,000, and in the rest of England at the rate of 2.7 per 1,000. I applied for summonses in 62 cases, at the hearing of which fines and costs amounting to £137 8s. 6d. were imposed. The particulars of these will be found in the appendix. Article. Adulterated.

With few exceptions all houses are provided with properlyflushed modern water closets, discharging through appropriate pipes into brick sewers, which also convey the surface water and most of the rainfall. The Southern portion of the Borough, being isolated by the Victoria and Albert Dock, is drained into a main sewer running from West to East, through a narrow strip of the Southern portion of the Borough of East Ham, whence it discharges into the London County Council Sewer in North Woolwich. The North-western corner of the Borough—an area of roughly 120 acres containing two terraces of houses and some isolated houses and factories—remains unsewered, the excrement disposal consisting of cesspools, while scattered cesspools are to be found here and there in a few places remote from the general system of sewerage. The sewers draining the main portion of the district (five-sixths of the whole area) converge by means of specially constructed intercepting sewers to the Corporation's Pumping Station, situate near the middle of the Western border of the Borough. Here the sewerage is pumped into the Northern Metropolitan Outfall Sewer which crosses the Borough obliquely, whence it gravitates to the London Outfall at Barking. Collection of House Refuse.—By the West Ham Corporation Act, 1888, the Corporation is empowered to require owners of houses to provide movable receptacles for house refuse instead of ashpits, and by special bye-law the occupiers of houses are required to place them outside their houses on such days as the Council fix. Under these provisions the house refuse is collected twice each week by the Council's own vehicles. Thirty-six carts and vans are used, 24 and the staff employed numbers 56 men, besides the Dust Inspector and two foremen. The total amount collected during the 306 working days in the year was 28,699 loads, an increase of 308 loads on the previous year. The shoots on which the above house refuse was deposited, together with the number of loads in each case, are set out below :— Out of the Borough. .

Acting on this instruction the Public Health Committee went very carefully into the matter during the year 1910, visiting Dust Destructors in various parts of the Metropolis. They also considered the question of removing both by barge and rail, and eventually recommended to the Council that no alteration should be made in the method of disposal as far as the northern part of the Borough was concerned, but that the principle of " barging" be adopted for the southern portion of the Borough. This recommendation was adopted by the Council, and negotiations were entered into with the Gas Light and Coke Company for the lease of a Wharf by the Iron Bridge, Canning Town. The subsequent result and developments of these negotiations entered into the current year (1911), and will be dealt with accordingly. I have reproduced some photographs taken for me by Messrs. •J. A. Cheatle and E. S. Burrough, showing the Beckton Road Dust /Shoot and the surrounding district from the top of the Shoot. BYE LAWS RELATING TO OFFENSIVE TRADES, COMMON LODGING HOUSES, &c. Offensive Trades.— Upwards of thirty premises where statutory offensive businesses are carried on are located in the Borough and include soap manufacturers, 9; fat melters and bone boilers, 14; gut scrapers, 2; fish and offal contractors, 2 ; organic manure manufacturers, 2; other trades, 3. These are subject to constant inspection and may be said to be carried on with comparatively little nuisance to the general public. Side of Shoot showing Fires. View from Shoot looking South-East.

A. Towers & Co., in Barbers Road, was granted subject to the necessary work being carried out to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health. An application from Mr. Lawson S. Wright, of Bethnal Green, to establish the trade of tallow-melting and bone-boiling at premises formerly in the occupation of Messrs. Morris & Bolton, Barbers Road, was deferred for the submission of detailed plans of premises and plant proposed to be used. This plan was eventually submitted and permission was granted subject to the necessary work being carried out to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health. An application from Messrs. Hornett, Foster & Co., Ltd., to take over the business of Mr. W. H. Hornett, in Barbers Road, was granted. Common Lodging Houses.—There are 13 Common Lodging Houses in the Borough, seven in the Stratford district and six in the Tidal Basin district, all of which, with one exception, were originally constructed and used for other purposes such as private dwellings or warehouses, and have been adapted more or less successfully to meet the requirements of the Common Lodging House Bye-laws. The accommodation in these amount to 652 beds. During the year Mr. Thomas Charles Felton was registered as the Keeper of the Common Lodging House Nos. 4 and 6, Crawford Street, and Mr. Thomas Foster was registered as the Keeper of No. 72, Great Eastern Road. 28 Schools.—The Public Elementary Schools consist of 48 Council Schools and 14 Non-Provided Schools, together with four Council Special Schools, and two Higher Elementary Schools, affording in the aggregate accommodation for 67,122 scholars. The Schools are for the most part modern substantially built buildings, adequately supplied with water and provided with sufficient surrounding air space, while their general cleanliness appears to be well looked after. With a view to checking the spread of epidemic disease it has been the practice for many years past for the Medical Officer of Health on receiving information of the occurrence of infectious disease in the family of a scholar to send a red-coloured notice to the Head Teacher of the School (Day School and Sunday School) recommending the exclusion of children coming from the infected home, subsequently followed by a white notice freeing the family from quarantine on the completion of the necessary isolation and the official disinfection of the premises. Each School is provided with a supply of disinfectants for general or special use. The particular action taken with regard to Schools during the year will be found under the heading " Chief Zymotic Diseases." Methods of Dealing with Infectious Disease.—Prior to the Infectious Disease Notification Act, 1899, the notification of these diseases in West Ham had been compulsory for 11 years, under special powers obtained by the West Ham Corporation Act, 1888, which provided for the notification of all the diseases specified in the general Act, with the exception of Erysipelas and Membranous Croup. 29 The Hospital accommodation of the Borough for the isolation of infectious disease consists of— (1) The Plaistow Fever Hospital (opened as to two wards in 1896 and as to the completed Hospital in 1901) now contains 210 beds, allocated to the following purposes: 110 beds for Scarlet Fever, 63 for Diphtheria, 22 for Enteric Fever, and 15 isolation beds for Mixed or Staff cases. (2) Dagenham Small-pox Hospital, situate about 9 miles from the Borough, occupying a site of 6½ acres, enclosed within a farm of 119 acres, owned and cultivated by the Council, was opened in 1899. It consists of permanent buildings capable of accommodating 50 patients with the administrative staff required for their care, together with temporary iron buildings sufficient to treat 300 cases. Under agreement, eight other Sanitary Authorities contribute to the establishment and maintenance of this Hospital, in consideration of West Ham undertaking to receive and treat all the Small-pox cases sent to the Hospital by those Authorities. {3) The Grange Convalescent Home is situate about 9½ miles from the Borough at Harold Wood, Essex, in which the accommodation is ample for 40 children. This Home consists of a residential mansion with outbuildings and 7 acre3 of ground, together with 61½ acres of pasture land, and has required considerable alterations and additions to render it fit for its present use. The Home was opened for the reception of patients on 22nd February, 1909. 30 In connection with the Dagenham Hospital is a building containing an Equifex steam disinfector for Hospital use, while attached to the Plaistow Fever Hospital is a large Washington-Lyons disinfector, so arranged as to serve the purposes of a public disinfecting station for the treatment of bedding, &c., of infectious cases occurring in the Borough on removal to hospital or on recovery at home. Methods of Control of Tuberculosis.—Down to the end of 1908 no system, voluntary or compulsory, of notification of Pulmonary Tuberculosis pertained in West Ham, and consequently very few cases of living consumptives were brought to the knowledge of the Public Health Department. Since 1st January, 1909, The Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908, issued by the Local Government Board, have been in operation, by which the notification of Phthisis occurring in Poor Law Institutions or under the care of District Medical Officers became compulsory. In all cases notified a member of the Sanitary Staff visits the home, with a view to the remedying of any existing defects in the structural surroundings of the patient, of advising him as to the necessity of properly using the means at his disposal, of aiding him by verbal converse and printed literature to appreciate the value to himself and his family of the proper treatment and disposal of his expectoration, and of teaching him the right use of disinfectants. In every case of a recorded death from Phthisis a similar visit is paid, disinfection of the premises advised and, in most cases, carried out. During the year 1910, 312 notifications of Phthisis in Poor Law cases were received. The total number of deaths from Phthisis in the whole Borough was 337, equal to a death-rate of 11.7 per 1,000, while the deaths from other tubercular diseases numbered 117, equal to a death-rate of 040 per 1,000. During the previous 10 years the 31 average death rate from Phthisis was 1.29 per 1,000, and that of other tubercular diseases was 0.59 per 1,000. During the week ended the 5th March, 1910, the "Tuberculosis Exhibition" of the National Association for the Prevention of Consumption paid a visit to the Borough. The object of this Exhibition is to direct attention to the ravages of the disease, to show how the disease is caused and spread, and to point out the methods to be adopted for its cure and the best steps to be taken for its prevention. In June, 1909, the Canning Town Health Society suggested to the Public Health Committee the advisability of inviting the National Association to bring their exhibition to West Ham, and the Town Council, on the recommendation of the Committee, cordially agreed to the proposal by voting £20 towards the expenses and granting the free use of the Public Hali, Canning Town, for the purpose, the arrangements being left to the Public Health Committee. A large and influential general committee, consisting of Ministers of religion, medical men, and prominent citizens of both sexes, was convened, and an Executive Committee appointed, over which the Chairman of the Public Health Committee (Alderman J. R. MooreSmith) presided. At the request of the Committee upwards of 200 ladies and gentlemen volunteered to act as demonstrators at the various stands during periods of two hours each morning, afternoon, and evening, and the organisation of this voluntary force, kindly undertaken by Mr. W. G. Martley and Mr. Wolseley Lewis, added materially to the success of the exhibition. The opening ceremony, conducted by t\e Mayor (Alderman Geo. Hosking) on the afternoon of Saturday, February 26th, was well attended, as also were each day of the subsequent week, while on each evening the Hall was continuously crowded. 32 Special Popular Lectures, illustrated by lantern slides, were given by prominent medical men and others in the minor hall as under:— Date. Chairman. Lecturer. Subject. Feb. 26, 8 p.m. Dr P. J. S. Nicoll Dr. Tos. D. Lister A Working Man's Sanatorium. Mar. 1, 3 p. m. Miss Cheetham Dr Lilian Simpson Address to Women. Mar. 1, 8 p.m. Dr. A. Graham Dr. J. J. Perkins The Conquest of Consumption. Mar. 2, 8 p.m. - The Medical Officer of Health. Healthy Living. Mar. 3, 8 p.m. Dr. J. Biernacki Dr. C. Theodore Williams. The Nature of Consumption and the Best Methods of Dealing with it Mar. 4, 8p.m. W. G. Martley, Esq. Stanley Bates, Esq. Home Treatment of Consumption. Mar. 5, 8 p.m. A. Watkins, Esq. Peter M. Short, Esq. The White Plague of Civilization. These lectures proved to be so popular that after the first day each address had to be delivered twice over, and even then many seekers after knowledge turned away from the crowded hall disappointed. At the request of the Public Health Committee, the Education Committee permitted the elder boys and girls in the Elementary Schools to visit the Exhibition during School hours and the Rota prepared for this purpose by Mr. Madden and Miss Ware enabled a large number of senior scholars to attend. The total number of persons who visited the Hall was 28,945, Tuesday being the heaviest day:— Saturday, February 26 1,593 Sunday, „ 27 2,051 Monday, ,, 28 2,891 Tuesday, March 1 5,157 Wednesday, „ 2 4,265 Thursday, „ 3 4,949 Friday, „ 4 4,278 Saturday, „ 5 3,761 28,945 33 The amounts expended directly in connection with the Tuberculosis Exhibition are set out in detail below:— £ s. d.

The Council at its meeting subsequent to the close of the Exhibition voted the donation of £5 5s. to the funds of the National Association for the Prevention of Consumption. C 34 VITAL STATISTICS. The population of the Borough at the Census in 1901 was 267,358. The number of inhabited houses was 41,433, giving 6.4 persons to each house. The Registrar-General's estimate of the population at the middle of 1910 was 328,585, but at the time of writing this Report the provisional census population for the County Borough as on the 1st of April, 1911, has been announced at 289,102, therefore the revised estimated population to the middle of 1910 has been calculated to be 287,471. The area of the Borough is 4,706 acres, so that at the Census in 1901 there were 56'8 persons to the acre. Below is given the areas of the wards of the Borough (excluding water) and the population per acre in each ward at Census 1901:— Ward. Area in Acres. Persons per Acre. New Town 404.6 45.3 Forest Gate 256.6 77.7 High Street 550.4 34.5 Broadway 171.6 91.6 Park 262.0 58.3 Upton 270.8 65.1 West Ham 301.0 105.1 Plaistow 355.8 75.1 Hudsons 448.8 52.8 Canning Town 474.4 50.9 Tidal Basin 274.2 106.2 Custom House 684.2 38.5 35 Births.—The number of births registered daring the year was 8,646 (4,428 males and 4,218 females), being 84 less than the previous year and 508 less than the average number during the last 10 years. The birth-rate for the year was 30 0 per 1,000, while the average birth-rate during the 10 years 1900-1909 was 33 2 per 1,000. Distributed to the various wards of the Borough the births were as follows :— Ward. Males. Females. Total births. New Town 223 231 454 Forest Gate 195 211 406 High Street 341 264 605 Broadway 215 160 375 Park 171 160 331 Upton 174 139 313 West Ham 519 525 1,044 Plaistow 571 548 1,119 Hudsons 492 456 948 Canning Town 488 466 954 Tidal Basin 587 594 1,181 Custom House 452 464 916 Illegitimate Births.—162, or 19 per cent. of the above, were illegitimate births. C 2 36 Deaths.—The number of deaths registered in the Borough during the year was 2,837, including the following deaths in public institutions within the district:— Under 1 year. One year and upwards. Plaistow Hospital 4 71 West Ham Hospital 7 67 St. Mary's Hospital 22 30 Seamen's Branch Hospital — 42 Plaistow Maternity Charity 11 2 Medical Mission Hospital 5 13 Poplar Branch Workhouse — 23 Other Institutions — 14 Non-residents registered in the district 10 94 The 2,837 deaths do not include the under-mentioned deaths in public institutions outside the district:— Under 1 year. One year and upwards. Workhouse and Infirmary 30 599 Borough Asylum — 76 Dagenham Small-pox Hospital — — Residents dying in London Institutions. 41 254 37 After the suitable adjustments rendered necessary by the foregoing tables have been made, the net deaths of the Borough numbered 3,773 (1,983 males and 1,790 females), being 662 less than the previous year and 881 below the average for the last ten years. This makes an annual death-rate for the year of 13.1 per 1,000, or 3.8 below the average death-rate during the ten years 1900-1909, which was 16.9 per 1,000. Corrected for age and sex distribution, the annual death-rate becomes 14.0 per 1,000, the factor for correction being 1.0693. Both the foregoing birth-rate and death-rate, as well as the subsequent rates, have been calculated from a population estimated at the middle of the year at 287,471, being the corrected estimate based on the Census figure for 1911. During the year the number of houses completed and passed for habitation by the Borough Engineer's Staff were as follows:— New Town — West Ham 7 Forest Gate 9 Plaistow 12 High Street — Hudsons 11 Broadway — Canning Town — Park 5 Tidal Basin — Upton — Custom House 25 38 The net deaths mentioned above distributed to Wards were as follows:— Under 1 year.

In the following tables I append particulars as far as possible relating to each disease separately—both notifiable and non-notifiable epidemic diseases. In 39 the case of the latter, however, the reported cases are necessarily inexact, as the numbers are chiefly obtained from the School Attendance Officers, who are unable in many cases to verify by medical certificate the nature of the illness alleged to be the cause of absence from School.

The contributing Authorities who signed the new Agreement are the Romford Joint Hospital Board, East Ham Borough Council, the Urban District Councils of Walthamstow, Woodford, Ilford, Wanstead, and Barking, and the Ongar Rural District Council. During the year applications were received from the Urban Districts of Waltham, Loughton, and Brentwood, and the Rural District of Billericay, for those Sanitary Authorities to be contributing Authorities under the Agreement, but the Council were unable to accede to their requests. Scarlet Fever.—There was a very considerable reduction in the number of cases from this disease; 990 cases were notified, being 628 less than in 1909, equivalent to an attack-rate of 3.4 per 1,000, the average attack-rate for the preceding ten years 1900-1909 being 4.5 per 1,000. Nineteen deaths occurred, making an annual deathrate of 0.06 per 1,000, the average death-rate for the preceding ten years 1900-1909 being 0.13 per 1,000. Of the notified cases, 703, or 71 per cent., were removed to Hospital, an increase of 9 per cent. on the previous year. The number of cases transferred from Plaistow Hospital to the Convalescent Home, Harold Wood, during the year was 260, where the average duration of stay amounted to 40 days. Diphtheria.—The number of cases of this disease notified during 1910 was 354, being the smallest number notified in any one year since 1891. The attack-rate was 1.12 per 1,000, the average attack-rate during the past 10 years being 2.7 per 1,000. 41 Fifty deaths occurred from Diphtheria, equal to an annual death-rate of 017 per 1,000, the average death-rate during the past 10 years being 0.34 per 1,000. The fatality or ratio of deaths to attacks was 14 per cent., while in the year 1891 it was 30 per cent. Of the 354 cases notified, 264, or 74 per cent., were removed to Hospital. Enteric Fever.—The number of cases of this disease has been diminishing during recent years in West Ham, as in the rest of the country, although the year under review shews an increase in the number of cases over that of 1909. Altogether 114 cases were notified, equivalent to an annual attack-rate of 0.31 per 1,000, the average attack-rate during the preceding 10 years being 1.01 per 1,000. 17 deaths occurred, making an annual death-rate of 0.05 per 1,000, the average death-rate during the previous 10 years being 0.16 per 1,000. Of the 114 notified cases, 103, or 90 per cent., were removed to Hospital. Besides the admission into Plaistow Hospital of cases of the preceding three diseases, the mixed and other cases received there during the year were as follows:— Re-admitted cases 6 Measles 6 Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria 4 ,, „ Chicken Pox 2 „ ,, Whooping Cough 1 „ „ Measles 1 Diphtheria and Enteric Fever 1 ,, „ Whooping Cough 2 ,, „ Measles 2 „ „ Croup 1 Carried forward 26 42 Brought forward 26 Enteric Fever and Pneumonia 1 Croup and Pneumonia 1 Croup 0 Erysipelas 1 Suspected Typhus Fever 3 Making a total of 34 Typhus Fever.—During the first quarter of 1910 a small outbreak of this disease occurred in Tidal Basin Ward, the first group of cases which have occurred in West Ham since the incorporation of the Borough. One death from typhus fever was recorded in 1899, but since then the Borough has been free from it. Typhus, known also as Gaol Fever and Ship Fever from its frequency of attack upon prisons and vessels in the past, and as Spotted Fever from its petechial rash, although severely epidemic in the temperate climates of Europe and especially in Ireland during the seventeenth and eighteenth •centuries, so that in 1780 Haslar Hospital received 5,539 cases of fever in the year from the Channel Fleet alone, has been rapidly diminishing in extent and virulence of recent years owing to modern sanitation. While there is little doubt that the disease is caused by a microorganism, and several have been described as associated with it, the specific organism has not yet been established. The predisposing causes however are clear, as almost all recorded epidemics have been traced to long-continued overcrowding in association with destitution, defective ventilation, and personal filth. When once established the disease is highly infectious, but the range of infection does not extend to any great distance from the sufferer, though it may be conveyed by clothing and possibly by fleas and flies. The period of greatest 43 prevalence comprises the earlier months of the year. Liability to attack appears to be equal in the two sexes. With regard to age adolescents seem to be most vulnerable, but in respect of fatality the risks to life increase with age. Authorities have held the period of incubation to last from five to twelve days. The outbreak began in the middle of February and ended with the last week in March, no case, even of a suspicious character, being brought to light after that date. Eight cases in all were reported, of which one proved fatal, giving a case mortality of 12.5 per cent. These eight cases involved four families, three persons being attacked in two families and a single sufferer in each of the other two. The particulars of the cases are given below:— Case 1. C. I., aged 22, a nurse attached to the Plaistow Maternity Charity and District Nurses' Home, was admitted to the Plaistow Fever Hospital on 11th February as a suspected case of Typhus. She appears to have been attacked on 9th February. The diagnosis was confirmed on 15th February, the patient exhibited well marked crisis on 23rd February, and subsequently made an uninterrupted recovery. In the meantime her cubicle and clothing at the Home had been thoroughly disinfected. A list of all the cases which this nurse had attended during the previous month was carefully gone through, but with the single exception of one case of recovery from Pneumonia in a boy, whom she had left more than three weeks before her attack, no patient likely to have caused her illness could be found. No other case occurred in connection with the Home. Case 2. D. B., a girl aged 13 years, of 2, Poplar Street was admitted to the West Ham Union Infirmary on 17th 44 January and discharged on 12th March. Her condition was such as to cause the Medical Superintendent to suspect Typhus, hut not sufficient to justify notification. In view of subsequent events, however, it is very possible that her illness may have been due to that disease. Case 3. J. H., boy, aged 7, of 2, Poplar Street, halfbrother of Case 2, was admitted to the Infirmary on 11th February with symptoms also suggestive of Typhus but very indefinite in character. See Case 5. Case 4. N. A., female, aged 35 years, of 8, Sabberton Street, was taken ill on 17th February, was seen by the District Medical Officer on 20th February and admitted to the Infirmary on 22nd February. On 27th February she was notified to be suffering from Typhus. The family (husband, wife, and five children), occupying three rooms, use two and sleep in one room. Husband has had no regular work for five years and is now out of work, the wife earns a little by pawning for neighbours, but appears to indulge in drink and neglect home and children. Scarcely any furniture and bedding filthy. After the subsequent removal of the family the bedding was destroyed, and the whole premises disinfected. A family consisting of husband and wife and three children occupying the ground floor, although extremely poor owing to want of work, exhibited clean rooms and clothing and were not attacked. Case 5. J. W. H., aged 58, of 10, Smith Street, father of Case 3, a general labourer out of work, removed to above address from 2, Poplar Street. He was taken ill on 12th March, removed to the Infirmary on 15th March, notified on 16th and died on 23rd March. D.B. (Case 2), returned to 10, Smith Street, on 12th March, but her step-father was taken ill before her arrival. It appears, however, that Mrs. H. 45 had visited both Gases 2 and 3 at the Infirmary and had subsequently suffered from illness associated with pains in the limbs which she considered rheumatic, but which may have been anomalous typhus. The two rooms occupied by the family are damp, and their circumstances extremely precarious, the only income for some time being 6s. per week earned by Mrs. H., in sewing for neighbours. The family occupying the first floor, consisting of three adults and seven children, were not attacked. Sanitary Notices to execute repairs at both Smith Street and Poplar Street were served after disinfection. Case 6. G. D., boy aged 11 years, of 30, Sidney Street, was attacked on 21st March, admitted to Plaistow Fever Hospital on 2.5th March and notified on the following day. The only defect found in these premises was a foul W.C. pan. The house and contents were clean, the employment of the family good, food plentiful, no overcrowding existed, and the patient's movements prior to his illness offered no explanation to his attack. Case 7. S. A., aged 37 years, of 8, Sabberton Street, husband of Case 4, was admitted, with his children, to the Infirmary on 28th March and notified on 1st April. His date of attack is given as 22nd March, but he appears to have been ailing before this. Case 8. C. A., boy aged 4, son of Case 7, admitted to the Infirmary with his father. Measles.—This disease was dealt with very freely in the Annual Report for 1908. The number of cases reported by the School Attendance Officers was normal during 1910 until nearly the end of the year, when the disease assumed epidemic prevalence; 799 cases were reported more than half of which occurred during the last two 46 months of the year. The deaths numbered 100, making an annual death-rate of 0.34 per 1,000, the average death-rate during the previousten years being 0.57 per 1,000 Whooping Cough.—This disease frequently becomes epidemic when Measles is prevalent, and also occurs as a sequelæ of that affection, as is evidenced by the fact that of the 140 cases brought to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health 86 were reported during the last two months of the year. The number of deaths during the year was 83, equivalent to an annual death-rateof 0.28 per 1,000, the average death-rate for the preceding ten years being 1.41 per 1,000. Diarrhœa.—Epidemic Diarrhoea, which is always responsible for the greater part of the zymotic death-rate, and generally accounts for a considerable share in the death-roll in young children, showed an increase in the number of deaths over last year of 29. In West Ham 201 deaths occurred, equal to an annual death-rate of 0.69 per 1,000, the average death-rate for the past ten years 1900-1909 being 1.41 per 1,000. Bronchitis (acute and chronic) caused 386 deaths, or a deathrate of 1.34 per 1,000, the average rate for the past ten years being 1.6 per 1,000, while the deaths from Pneumonia numbered 322, equal to a death-rate of 1.12 per 1,000 as compared with an average rate of 1.41 for the preceding ten years. Heart Diseases were responsible for 267 deaths, giving a death-rate of 0.92 per 1,000, the ten years' average rate being 0.99 per 1,000. Cancer, in which term is included all forms of malignant growth, showed an increase in fatality, 232 deaths being recorded as 47 against 225 last year. The death-rate is equal to 0.80 per 1,000 as compared with a ten years' average rate of 0.74 per 1,000. Tubercular Diseases.—The deaths from Phthisis, or tubercular disease of the lung, have already been reported as numbering 337. In addition to these 117 deaths occurred from tubercular diseases other than Phthisis, equal to a death-rate of 0.40 per 1,000, the ten years' average being 0.59 per 1,000. Puerperal Fever.—Fourteen cases of this disease were notified during the year, and four proved fatal, giving a case mortality of 28 per cent. The attack rate (0.04 per 1,000) was below the average rate for the previous ten years (0.05 per 1,000), while the death-rate (0.01 per 1,000) was considerably below the average for ten years (0.03 per 1,000). Midwives Act, 1902.—The Midwives' Roll for 1910 contained the names of 374 Certified Midwives residing in West Ham, being an increase of 16 on the names on the Roll for the previous year, which numbered 358. Onty 58 midwives sent in notice of their intention to practise during the year in accordance with Section 10 of the Act. 148 records of sending for medical aid were received from 41 midwives, and the causes which induced them to require assistance are detailed as under:— Patient unsatisfactory, first stage 4 „ „ second stage 36 „ „ third stage 5 Transverse presentation 6 Mal „ 4 Brecch „ 2 Face „ 3 48 Ante-partum haemorrhage 10 Post-partum haemorrhage 10 Retained placenta 9 Rise of temperature 14 Ruptured perinæum 14 Feeble infant 8 Asphyxiated lady 1 „ baby 3 Congenital malformation 1 Ophthalmia 1 Œdema 1 Prolapse of cord 5 Death of infant 5 Premature infant 3 Convulsion in infant 1 Of the total 8,646 births registered in the Borough, 3,865 were attended by Certified Midwives attached to the Institutions of the Plaistow Maternity Charity— 2,482 were attended from Howard's Road. 1,383 „ „ Lansdowne Road. The following circulars have been drawn up and circulated by the Central Midwives Board:— CANCER OF THE WOMB. This disease is probably the greatest dread of women. Unless treated early by removal it always ends in death. At first it is only in the part attacked, and is not "in the system." If removed early it can frequently be cured. 49 Every day, and even every minute, is of importance, and no time at all should be lost. The earliest symptom is generally a red discharge, which does not occur at the proper time for the monthly period. This may be quite slight. If the womb bleeds on touch this generally means Cancer. The discharge does not generally smell bad, nor is there pain, at first. A bad-smelling discharge should always be attended to at once. Any discharge, either red or offensive, in a woman in whom the monthly periods have ceased for some time should be attended to at once. It is not true that "the Change of Life" is properly marked by floodings, or by irregular bleedings, or by special discharge of any kind. It often happens that a woman who has floodings or irregular bleedings or marked discharge about the time of "the Change of Life" is told by her friends that it means no harm and is "only the Change of Life." Instead of going to a doctor she does nothing until the disease is so far advanced that no operation will save her, and she throws away her life. All women who have floodings, or irregular bleedings, or marked discharge of any kind (especially if offensive, but also even if not offensive) should go at once to a properly qualified D 50 medical practitioner, and ask to be examined thoroughly. If women did this main' lives could be saved. All women (such as nurses and midwives, but not only they) who are especially liable to be consulted on these matters, should avoid expressing any opinion of their own, but should advise the enquirer to go at once to a properly qualified medical practitioner and insist on being examined. F. H. Champneys, M.D., F.R.C.P., Chairman of the Central Midwives Board. INFLAMMATION OF THE EYES IN NEWBORN CHILDREN. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. This is a very common cause of hopeless blindness, which is one of the greatest misfortunes that can happen to a child. A very large number of children will be saved from blindness if the following directions of the Central Midwives Board are observed. The disease generally arises from purulent discharges from the mother getting into the baby's eyes at birth. It is therefore of the greatest importance that this should be prevented:— 1. By curing such discharges if possible before Labour. This requires medical treatment (Rule E 19 (2) & (3)). 2. By taking the greatest care that such discharges shall not be carried into the baby's eyes when it opens them for the first time soon after its head is born. 51 The discharges may be carried into the baby's eyes in the following ways:— (a) The discharges collect round its eyes, especially the eyelashes, and easily get into its eyes. This can be generally prevented if the midwife observes Rule E 14: "As soon as the child's head is born, and if possible before the eyes are opened, its eyelids must be carefully cleansed." They should be thoroughly wiped with clean material such as cotton-wool, lint, or rag, using separate pieces for each eye. The reason for this is that the piece used for wiping the first eye will be polluted by the discharges, and should not be used for the other eye. (b) Newborn babies sometimes rub their eyes with their hands. This may rub the discharges into their eyes. When Rule E 14 has been complied with the baby's hands must be carefully cleansed. (c) When the baby is bathed the discharges with which its body is covered during Labour are washed off into the bath-water. If its face is washed in this water, matter may get into the eyes. N.B.—The above directions are to be observed in all cases whether purulent discharges are known to be present or not. The Central Midwives Board is determined, so far as lies in its power, to secure the strict observance of its rules and directions, and to punish any failure to comply with them, even d 2 52 in cases where no harm can be proved to have followed from their neglect. F. H. Champneys, M.D., F. R.C.P., Chairman of the Central Midwives Board. Infant Mortality.—Much has been done of recent years to inspire interest in the question of providing the best means of combating with the great waste of infant life, and although the recent summers have been very favourable to the newly born, there is little doubt some of the improvement which has taken place in the infant mortality rate has been the result of painstaking visitation and the steady infusion of knowledge. Infant mortality is usually recorded in comparison with the number of births. The total number of infants who died before they reached the age of one year during 1910 was 86G, being 212 fewer than in 1909. This is equivalent to an infant death-rate of 100 per 1,000 births. The average rate during the past ten years 1900-1909 was 151 per 1,000 births. Nearly one-fifth of these infants died within a week of birth, and one-third within a month. Notification of Births Act, 1907.—The adoption of this Act by the Council on 14th January, 1908, received the sanction of the Local Government Board and came into operation in the Borough on 9th March, 1908. The Act provides for the notification in writing of every birth, whether still-born or otherwise, to the Medical Officer of Health within 36 horns of its occurrence by the father if he is actually residing in the house or by any person in attendance upon the mother at the time of or within six hours after the birth. The Act also provides for the inspection by the Registrars of Births and 53 Deaths of the register kept or notifications received, and has been of much assistance to the Registrars in enabling them to check false information and false addresses. Every medical practitioner and midwife is supplied with prepaid post-cards as required by the Act, and the following are the figures for the year:— Actual number of births received 7,467 Duplicate notifications 22 Still births 213 Notifications of births which belonged to other districts 140 375 Net West Ham births notified 7,092 Of the total 8,646 births registered in the year 162 were illegitimate, and of the total infant deaths 44 were illegitimate, so that the infantile mortality among the illegitimate children was 271 per 1,000 births, while that among the legitimate children was only 97 per 1,000 births. Factory and Workshops Act, 1901.—Section 132 provides that the Medical Officer of Health of every District Council, shall, in his annual report to them, report specifically on the administration of this Act in workshops and workplaces, and he shall send a copy of his annual report, or so much of it as deals with this subject, to the Secretary of State. 54 The following Tables are intended to cover the preceding provision:— 1.—INSPECTION.
