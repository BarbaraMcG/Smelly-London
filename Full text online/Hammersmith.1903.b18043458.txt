HAM 7 125 Annual Report OF THE Medical Officer of Health OF THE BOROUGH OF HAMMERSMITH For the Year 1903. 127 ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH OF THE BOROUGH OF HAMMERSMITH, For the year 1003. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Hammersmith. March 15th, 1904. Gentlemen—I beg to present to you my Annual Report for last year. The Report will deal with the vital statistics, and with the Sanitary work carried out under the direction of your Council during the 52 weeks ending on January 2nd, of the present year. Owing to a combination of favourable circumstances the statistics of the public health of last year are the most satisfactory on record. This is due to the low temperature of last summer, the large amount of rain, and the improved condition of the sanitation and sanitary administration of the Borough. The deaths of non.Burgesses have been deducted, and the deaths of Burgesses occurring in other parts of London have been added, in accordance with the Local Government Boards direction. Deaths of persons occurring in institutions receiving sick and infirm persons alone have been regarded for the purpose of correction. 128 BIRTHS. During last year 2,989 births were registered in this Borough against 3,192 in the previous year. Making due allowance for the increase of the population, the number of births registered last year was 253 below the average number registered during the previous 10 years. On the population estimated up to the middle of the year, i.e., 115,803 inhabitants, the number of births registered was equal to an annual rate of 25.8 births per 1,000 persons living. The birth.rate in London on the estimated population of London up to the middle of the year, i.e., 4,613,812 inhabitants, was equal to an annual rate of 29.7 births per 1,000 persons living. DEATHS. During last year 1,323 deaths were registered in this Borough, against 1,597 in the previous year. Making due allowance for the increase of the population, the number of deaths registered in this Borough last year was 434 below the average number registered during the previous 10 years. Adding 434 deaths of Burgesses of this Borough, which took place in general hospitals and other public institutions in other Boroughs of London, in London County Lunatic Asylums and Metropolitan Imbecile Asylums, and deducting 150 deaths of non.Burgesses which occurred, 108 at West London Hospital, 40 at Nazareth House, and 2 at the Hammersmith Infirmary, the corrected number of deaths of Burgesses registered last year was 1607. On the before mentioned estimated population, the corrected number of deaths of Burgesses registered last year was equal to an annual rate of 13.9 deaths per 1,000 persons living. The death rate in London on the estimated population of London up to the middle of the year was equal to an annual rate of 15.2 deaths per 1,000 persons living. 129 DEATHS OF INFANTS. The corrected number of deaths of Burgesses under one year of age registered was 418 against 441 in the previous year. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age registered last year was equal to 260 per 1,000 of the total deaths of Burgesses registered, and to 140 per 1.000 of the total registered births. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age in London last year was equal to 239 per 1,000 of the total deaths registered, and 131 per 1,000 of the total registered births. The mortality rate of infants under one year of age was, as compared with the total deaths of parishioners registered, 21 per 1,000, and, as compared with the total births registered, 9 per 1,000 greater in this Borough than in London. The fact that the infant mortality in this Borough is greater than in London, is owing to the population being chiefly confined to the artizan class. DEATHS OF AGED PERSONS. The corrected number of deaths of Burgesses at 60 years of age and upwards that were registered during last year was 468 against 565 in the previous year. These deaths last year were equal to 4.0 per 1,000 of the total persons living, and 291 per thousand of the total deaths of Burgesses registered. The deaths of persons registered at 60 years of age and upwards in London last year was equal to 4.2 per 1,000 of the total persons living, and 269 per 1,000 of the total deaths in London registered. This death.rate was, therefore, 2 per 1,000 less in this Borough than in London as compared with the total persons living, and 22 per 1,000 more in this Borough than in London as compared with the total deaths registered. These figures are indicative of a very favourable condition as regards longevity in this borough. J 130 TABLE I. Vital Statistics of Whole Districts during 1903 and previous Years. Year.

In small districts without recognised divisions of known population this Table need not be filled up. (4) Deaths of residents occurring in public institutions beyond the district are to be included in sub-columns c of this Table, and those of non-residents registered in public institutions in the district excluded. (Sec note on Tuble I. as to meaning of terms " resident "and" non-resident.'') (c) Deaths of residents occuriing in public icstitutions, whether within or without the district, are to be allotted to the respective localities according to the addresses of the deceased. (d) Care should be taken that the gross totals of the several columns in this Table respectively equal the corresponding totals for the whole districts in Tables I. and IV.: thus, the totals of sub-columns a, b, and c, should agree with the figures for the year in the columns 2, 3, and 12, respectively, of Table I.: the gross total of the sub-columns c should agree with the total of column 2 in Table IV., and the gross total of sub-columns d with the total of column 3 in Table IV. 132 TABLE III.

Notes.—(a) In this Table all deaths of "Residents" occurring in public institutions, whether within or wituout the district, are to be included with the other deaths in the columns for the several age groups (columns 2-8). They are also, in columns 9-15, to be included among the deaths in their respective "Localities" according to the previous addresses of the deceased as given by the Registrars. Deaths of " Non-residents "ccurring in public institutions in the district are in like manner to be excluded from columns 2-8 and 9-15 of this Table. 133 b) See notes on Table I. as to the meaning of "Residents" and "Nonresidents," and as to the "Public Institutions "to be taken into account for the purposes of these Tables. The "Localities" should be the same as those in Tables II. and III. (c) All deaths occurring in public institutions situated within the district, whether of "Residents" or of "Non.residents," are, in addition to being dealt with as in note (a), to be entered in the last column of this Table. The total number in this column should equal the figures for the year in column 9, Table I. (d) The total deaths in the several " Localities " in columns 9-15 of this Table should equal those for the year in the same localities in in Table II., sub.columns c. The total deaths at all ages in column 2 of this Table should equal the gross total of columns 9-15, and the figures for the year in column 12 of Table I. (e) Under the heading of " Diarrhœa " are to be included deaths certified as from diarrhœa, alone or in combination with some other cause of ill-defined nature ; and also deaths certified as from Epidemic enteritis; Zymotic enteritis; Epidemic diarrhœa. Summer diarrhœa; Dysentery and dysenteric diarrhœa; Choleraic diarrhœa, cholera, cholera nostras (in the absence of Asiatic cholera). Under the heading of "Enteritis" are to be included those certified as from Gastro.enteritis, Muco-enteritis, and Gastric catarrh, uuless from information obtained by enquiry from the certifying practitioner or otherwise, the Medical Officer of Health should have reason for including such deaths, especially those of infants, under the specific term "Diarrhœa." Under the headings of "Cancer," "Phthisis" and "Puerperal fever" should be included all registered deaths from causes comprised within these general terms. Deaths from diarrhoea secondary to some other well-defined disease should be included under the latter. In recording the facts under the various headings of Tables I.,II.,III. and IV., attention has been given to the notes on the Tables. N. C. COLLIER, Medical Officer of Health. March 25th, 1904. DEATHS FROM THE 9 PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The total number of deaths of Burgesses that were registered from the nine principal zymotic diseases was 182 against 236 in the previous year. The deaths of Burgesses last year from these diseases were equal to 113 per 1,000 of the total deaths of Burgesses registered, and were at the rate of 1.6 deaths per 1,000 134 persons living. The deaths from the 9 principal zymotic diseases in the whole of London were equal to 113 per 1,000 of the total deaths registered, and were at the rate of 1.8 deaths per 1,000 persons living. These deaths were, therefore, as compared with the total deaths of Burgesses registered, the same in this Borough as in London, and as compared with the population 0.2 per 1,000 less in this Borough than in London. TABLE IV. The following table shows the deaths of Burgesses registered from the 9 principal zymotic diseases which occurred in the 10 years 1894 to 1903. YEAR. Smallpox. Measles. Scarlet Fever.

The deaths from diphtheria show a marked decrease. This I have no doubt, is to a considerable extent due to the systematic house to house inspection of the Borough. 135 CASES OF ILLNESS REPORTED AS DUE TO INFECTIOUS DISEASE. There were, omitting chicken-pox and phthisis, 653 cases reported as due to notifiable infectious diseases in this Borough against 779 in the previous year. There were also 5 cases of chicken.pox, and 143 cases of phthisis notified, which diseases were not notifiable until in the previous year. Chicken.pox was made notifiable on February 7th, 1902, to January 7th, 1903, and phthisis, voluntary notifiable from April 7th, 1902. There were also reported 368 cases of infectious diseases that were not notifiable, against 328 in the previous year, 99 of these were chicken.pox, 137 measles, and 132 whooping cough. SMALL.POX. Six cases were reported as due to small.pox, against 92 cases iu the previous year. The 6 cases reported last year occurred in 6 streets in 6 houses. No death was registered. In no case did the disease spread from the moment that information was obtained in your Public Health Department. The following is the information obtained in reference to the cases. They were all specially reported on by me to the Public Health Committee:— No. 1.—The case of A— W— G—, aged 45, a potman employed and residing at a public.house in King Street. It appears that he was first taken ill on Thursday, May 7th, when he complained of back.ache and feverishness. On the same day he noticed a rash upon himself. He kept at his work until Monday, 11th May, when he applied at the West London Hospital for advice. He was detained there, and the illness was diagnosed as variola, and he was at once removed by the Metropolitan Asylums Board to Rotherhithe. He had resided at the house for nine weeks. There had been no case of illness lately at the house. It also appears that the patient had visited Kingston on Thursday, April 23rd, but although several cases of small.pox had previously occurred there, he was not aware that he had been exposed to infection. He had been vaccinated when a child, but not since. 136 No. 2.—The case of W— G, age 22, a carman employed at Creek Wharf, and residing in Somerset Place. It appears that he was first taken ill on Thursday, May 21st. He complained of back.ache and shivering. He continued at his work till Friday, May 22nd. On Saturday, May 23rd, he was too ill to go to work. He complained of headache, pains in the back and limbs, sore throat, vomiting. The same day a rash appeared on his wrists. On Sunday, 24th May, the rash had increased; a doctor was called in, he diagnosed the disease as variola, and the patient was at once removed by the Metropolitan Asylums Board to Rotherhithe. He had resided at the house for one month. There had been no case of illness lately at the house, and he was not aware as to how he had contracted the disease. He had been vaccinated when a child, but not since. No. 3.—The case of J— S—, age 76, no occupation, residing at No. —, Studland Street. It appears that he was first taken ill on June 11th, when he complained of pain in the back, headache and feverishness. A rash appeared on June 13th. On June 16th I was asked by Dr. Faw. cett to see the patient with him. I diagnosed the disease as variola, and he was at once removed by the Metropolitan Asylums Board to Rotherhithe. He had resided at the house since June 10th. He had previously resided at Albert Cottages, Stanley Road, Harrow. I afterwards ascertained that a case of small-pox had lately occurred at this house. It is therefore most probable that he contracted the disease while residing there. There had been no case of illness lately at No. —, Studland Street. He had been vaccinated when a child, but not since. No. 4.—The case of P— H—, age 29, a shop assistant employed by Messrs. M—, and residing at No. —, Ormiston Road. It appears that he was first taken ill on June 7th, when he complained of back.ache and was feverish. A rash appeared on June 11th. His private medical attendant diagnosed the disease as variola, and the patient was at onoe removed by the Metropolitan Asylums Board to Rotherhithe. He had resided at the house for some months. There had been no case of illness lately at the house, and he was not aware as to how he had contracted the disease. He had been vaccinated when a child, but not since. 137 No. 5.—.The case of L— G— P—, age 20, no occupation, residing at No. —, Cromwell Avenue. It appears that it was first known that she was ill on August 27th, when she noticed that she had a rash upon her. The case was diagnosed as variola by the patient's private medical attendant on August 28th, and removed the same day by the Metropolitan Asylums Board to Rotherhithe. She had resided at the flat for four months. There had been no previous case of illness lately at the flat, or any case of small.pox notified as having occurred at other flats in the same block. The patient was away from home for 14 days previous to August 27th. She had been staying at Dunmow, in Essex. No evidence could be obtained that there had been any case of illness at the house at which she had been staying. No. 6.—The case of J— R— B—, age 41, a Police Constable of the Notting Dale Station, residing at No. —, Tad. more Street. He was first taken ill on November 6th. A rash appeared on November 8th. The case was brought to my notice by a communication from the Notting Dale Station on November 10th, and the patient was removed the same day by the Metropolitan Asylums Board to Rotherhithe. I received the formal notification certificate on November 11th. He had resided at the house for two years. There had been no case of illness lately at the house. No evidence could be obtained as to how he had contracted the disease. The patient had been vaccinated when joining the police force 20 years ago, but it was not known whether he had been vaccinated in infancy. CHICKEN POX. One hundred and four cases of chicken.pox were reported, against 659 cases in the previous year. Of these 5 were notified before January 7th, the disease having been made notifiable by order of the London County Council up to that date. The 104 cases reported last year were treated at the homes of the patients. All adult cases of chicken.pox notified were at once visited and examined by myself, but no case last year was found to be one of varola. No death was registered. 138 MEASLES. One hundred and thirty seven cases were reported as due to measles, against 293 cases in the previous year. Twenty seven cases were not reported until after death, and in 110 cases the patients were suffering from the disease at the time when the information was received. Twenty seven deaths were registered. As this is not a notifiable disease it is of no use my giving the mortality rate on the cases reported as, no doubt, only a very small proportion of the cases which occurred were known of by me. NOTIFICATION OF MEASLES. The London County Council had under consideration the question of the notification of measles, but did not decide to bring the disease under the Notification Clause of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. It was decided, however, that the whole of the other provisions of the Act appertaining to a dangerous infectious disease should be made to apply to measles. It is clear that if it is necessary that the law appertaining to a dangerous infectious disease should be applied to measles it is of the first importance that the disease should be made notifiable, so that the law can be put into force.As it at present stands, notwithstanding the action of the London County Council, the law on the subject is practically inoperative. From the whole of the notifiable infectious diseases that occurred to the Burgesses in the Borough there were only a total of 48 deaths, whereas from measles alone there were 27 deaths. Judging from the total results, measles was the most dangerous infectious disease affecting the public health of the Borough. I have no hesitation in repeating my opinion that it is highly important that this disease be made notifiable. The disease is sure to be made notifiable eventually. The delay is due to the fact that the preconceived notions 139 on the subject prevent even Medical Officers of Health from looking at the question in an unprejudiced light. The seriousness of the evil to be grappled with must eventually demand that the question will be looked at in an unprejudiced light. There was a time, not so far back, when it was not realised that the facts in reference to small.pox demanded that the disease should be properly dealth with. I can remember a medical man making a formal complaint against me to the magistrate at the Hammersmith Police Court because I had removed a patient of his suffering from small.pox and had disinfected the premises. SCARLET FEVER. Three hundred and fourteen cases were reported as due to scarlet fever, against 349 in the previous year. Two hundred and fifty six cases reported last year were isolated at Isolation Hospitals, and 58 cases were treated at the homes of the patients. Eight deaths were registered. The mortality rate on the cases reported in the Borough was only 2.5 per cent. DIPHTHERIA AND DIPHTHERITIC MEMBRANOUS CROUP. One hundred and ninety cases were reported as due to diphtheria or diphtheritic membranous croup, against 172 cases in the previous year. One hundred and nineteen reported last year were treated at the Isolation Hospitals, and 41 at the homes of the patients. Nineteen deaths were registered. The mortality rate on the cases reported in the Borough was 11.9 per cent. WHOOPING COUGH. One hundred and thirty two cases were reported as due to whooping cough, against 78 cases in the previous year. All of the cases reported last year were treated 140 at home.Thirty one were not reported until after death. Thirty one deaths were registered. As this is not a notifiable disease it is of no use my giving the mortality rate on the cases reported, as doubtless a very large number of cases occurred which were not known of in your Public Health Department. ENTERIC FEVER. Fifty eight cases were reported as due to enteric fever, against 49 in the previous year. Thirty two of the cases reported last year were treated at the Isolation Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Ten deaths were registered The mortality rate on the cases reported was 17'2 per cent. TYPHUS FEVER. No case was reported as due to typhus fever, against no case in the previous year. SIMPLE CONTINUED FEVER. One case was reported as due to simple continued fever, against no case in the previous year. The case reported last year was treated at the home of the patient and recovered. RELAPSING FEVER. No case was reported as due to relapsing fever, against no case in the previous year. PUERPERAL FEVER. Six cases were reported as due to puerperal fever, against 7 cases in the previous year. Five of the cases reported last year were treated at the homes of the patients. One case was treated at the Fulham Infirmary. Five deaths were registered. The mortality on the cases reported was 83.3 per cent. 141 CHOLERA. No case was reported as due to cholera, against no case in the previous year. ERYSIPELAS. One hundred and eight cases were reported last year as due to erysipelas, against 110 cases in the previous year. Six deaths were registered. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 5.6 per cent. PLAGUE. No case was reported on due to plague, against no case in the previous year. TABLE V.

Eight deaths were registered as due to influenza, against 32 deaths in the previous year. No official action was taken in reference to this complaint, as no application was made for the disinfection of any of the houses in which death had occurred. PHTHISIS. The voluntary notification of phthisis, which your Council decided upon on the 7th April in the previous year, was continued last year. Altogether 143 cases were notified to me. These, no doubt, represent only a small proportion of the cases that occurred, as 175 deaths were registered, against 167 deaths in the previous year. In all cases notified or in which death occurred, the premises were at once inspected, and after death in all cases occurring in dwelling houses an offer was made to disinfect the premises at the expense of your Council. In every case a printed instruction as to the course that should be adopted for the prevention of consumption was left at the premises. In several instances advantage was taken of the offer of your Council to disinfect the premises. COUNCIL'S DUST SHOOT AT THE WHARF CHANCELLORS. During last year no complaint was made of a nuisance from the depositing of the refuse at your Council's wharf. LICENSED SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The whole of the 12 licensed slaughter houses in the Borough were under regular fortnightly inspection by the Inspector for offensive trades. At the annual inspection of slaughter houses in October, 1903, I had received notices that 12 licenses were to be applied for. 145 All of them were found to be, as far as your Council's requirements were concerned, in a satisfactory condition. Your Council decided to inform the London County Council that you offered no opposition to the renewal of any of the licenses, and at the Special Sessions, at the London County Council, held in October, the 12 licenses were granted.

The whole of the 63 bakehouses in the Borough were under a regular half.yearly inspection by the Factory Inspector. In 52 instances it was reported that the premises were not in a proper sanitary condition. Notices were at once served upon the bakers calling upon them to comply with the regulations of your Council. In each case the notice was complied with. It was not decided to apply for any summonses against bakers whose bakehouses were found not to be in conformity with the Act, as they readily complied with the requirements of your Council when called upon by notice to do so The following is a list of the bakehouses at present in the Borough :— NORTH DISTRICT.

Your Public Health Committee had under consideration the question as to the alterations and amendments that should be required before certificates of fitness were granted for the existing underground bakehouses. Acting upon the instruction of the Public Health Committee, I presented the following report on the subject. Special Report of the Medical Officer of Health in reference to the Underground Bakehouses in the Borough of Hammersmith. To the Public Health Committee.. Gentlemen, I beg to report to you that, in accordance with your instructions, I have visited and inspected the whole of the underground bakehouses, known at present to be in use in the Borough. 149 Under section 26 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the duties under sections 34, 35, and 81 of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1878, and sections 15 and 16 of the Factory and Workshops' Act Amendment Act, 1883, which relate to the cleanliness, ventilation, and other sanitary conditions of bakehouses which are workshops, were transferred for enforcement by the Sanitary Authority of the district in which the bakehouse is situated. Under the Factory and Workshops' Act, 1901, section 101— (1) An underground bakehouse shall not be used as a bakehouse, unless it was so used at the passing of this Act. (2) Subject to the foregoing provision, after the first of January, one thousand nine hundred and four, an underground bakehouse shall not be used unless certified by the District Council to be suitable for the purpose. (3) For the purpose of this section an underground bakehouse shall mean a bakehouse, any baking room of which is so situate that the surface of the floor is more than three feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street or ground adjoining or nearest to the room. The expression bakehouse means any room used for baking or for any process incidental thereto. (4) An underground bakehouse shall not be certified as suitable unless the District Council is satisfied that it is suitable as regards construction, light, ventilation, and in all other respects. (5) This section shall have effect as if it were included among the provisions relating to bakehouses which are referred to in section twenty.six of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. (6) If any place is used in contravention of this section, it shall be deemed to be a workshop not kept in con formity with this Act. (7) In the event of a refusal of a certificate by the District Council, the occupier of the bakehouse may within twenty.one days from the refusal by complaint apply to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction, and if it appears to the satisfaction of the Court that the bakehouse is suitable for use as regards construction, light, ventilation, and in all 150 other respects, the Court shall thereupon grant a certificate of suitability of the bakehouse, which shall have effect as if granted by the District Council. (8) Where any place has been let as a bakehouse and the certificate required by this section cannot be obtained unless structural alterations are made, and the occupier alleges that the whole or part of the expense of the alterations ought to be borne by the owner, he may by complaint apply to the Court of Summary Jurisdiction, and that Court may make such order concerning the expenses or their apportionment as appears to the Court to be just and equitable under the circumstances of the case, regard being had to the terms of any contract between the parties, or in the alternative the Court may at the request of the occupier determine the lease. There are altogether 42 underground bakehouses at present in use in the Borough; 17 of these are in the North District, 23 in the Centre District, and two in the South District. The following table gives the underground bakehouses in the Borough, with the names of the present occupiers: — NORTH DISTRICT. Address.

Light:— (A) The underground bakehouse shall be supplied with one or more windows, so as to be efficiently lighted in every part by daylight by means which shall exclude the entrance of street dsut. 189 Ventilation:— (i) The bakehouse shall be properly and effectually ventilated to the satisfaction of the Sanitary Authority by permanent inlets and outlets, other than the windows, communicating directly with the open air, one of the outlets to be over oven door, in such a way, and at such a height above the street level as to prevent the entrance of street dust and dirt. If necessray, artificial means of ventilation must be provided. All other respects:— 0) Dough-troughs, and all other furniture or fittings (if any), shall be mounted on strong castors, or wheels, so as to be readily moveable for cleaning purposes. (k) Proper provision shall be made for the storage of flour elsewhere than in the underground bakehouse itself, unless the bakehouse is sufficiently large so as not to be reduced below the minimum of 1,500 feet. (I) Properly covered receptacles shall be provided for the storage of all refuse matters, and such receptacles shall be emptied and cleansed at least once in every 24 hours. (m) No animal shall be kept in or allowed access to an underground bakehouse. (n) There shall not be in direct communication with the bakehouse any sanitary convenience, coal or other cellar, room, unpaved yard, or area, which may be a nuisance or cause contamination by foul air, dust or dirt. (o) The water supply for the bakehouse shall be drawn from the rising main and not from a storage cistern. (p) Plans, sections, and all other necessary drawings (to scale), together with specifications, shall be submitted for approval before any alterations of a structural character are commenced. (q) Where no structural alterations are necessary in order to comply with the above requirements, but where alterations other than structural are required, specifications of the nature of the work proposed to be done, must be submitted to the Borough Council. (Compliance with the above requirements shall not necessarily mean that the Sanitary Authority will grant a certificate, as each underground bakehouse must be dealt with on its individual merits.) 190 Your Council decided to serve a notice upon each of the bakers informing them as to the alterations and amendments that were necessary before certificates of fitness would be granted. I subsequently reported from time to time as to those bakers who had complied. Altogether 38 bakers strictly complied with your requirements and were granted certificates of fitness under the Seal of your Council. Four bakers did not apply for certificates. Two of these decided to construct new bakehouses above ground. In no case was it found to be necessary to take legal proceedings against a baker for using a bakehouse without a certificate of fitness from your Council. In order to deal as leniently as possible where necessary an extension of time was granted to enable the applicant to comply with the requirements and obtain the necessary certificate. SEIZURE OF UNWHOLESOME FOOD. During last year one seizure was made of food which was unsound, unwholesome and unfit for the food of man. Several rabbits were removed from a stall in King Street, Hammersmith and taken before the magistrate at the West London Police Court. The magistrate condemned the rabbits and granted two summonses against the owner. At the hearing, fines to the amount of 15s. with 4s. costs were ordered. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. During last year the Public Health Committee gave directions for the registration of 697 "houses let in lodgings or occupied by the members of more than one family," making a total with those previously ordered to 191 be registered of 2,056 premises. Upon the registration a copy of the Bye-laws of your Council under which such houses are registered, was forwarded to the landlord (within the meaning of the Bye-laws), for his guidance. From various causes 238 bouses have been removed from the list, leaving a total number now on the Register of 1,818. During the year 261 notices were served and 258 had been complied with. Your Council having now appointed a special Inspector to supervise this work, this important branch of the administration is on the road to have the consideration it deserves. There can be no doubt, however, that as the number of premises upon the register increases, it will be found that one Inspector will not be able to efficiently supervise the work. SANITARY NOTICES AND ADMINISTRATION. During last year 3,314 notices were reported as having been served by your Sanitary Inspectors, having for their object the removal or prevention of nuisances or insanitary conditions, against 3,129 in the previous year, and during last year 3,058 notices were reported as having been complied with, against 2,916 in the previous year. The House-to-House Inspection has been continued during the year. This Inspector reports that during the year he has inspected 3,844 houses and other premises in the Borough, against 3,418 houses in the previous year. The defects in premises discovered, as the result of his inspection, were as usual dealt with by the four District Sanitary Inspectors. Your Factory Inspector has during the year served 226 notices under the Factory and Workshop Act, and during the same period 225 notices have been complied with. During the previous year there were 247 notices served and 245 complied with. 192 The following is a list of the Factories and Workshops upon the Register:— Restaurants, Hotels, &c 72 Bakehouses 63 Bootmakers 55 Motor and Cycle Makers and Engineers 26 Dressmakers and Milliners 215 Laundries 321 Letterpress Printers and Bookbinders 26 Electrical and Mechanical Engineers 43 Smiths, Wheelwrights, and Coachbuilders 34 Tailors 42 Bottle Washing Works 12 Dry Cleaning, Dyeing, and Carpet Beating Works 16 Firewood Cutters 12 Builders and Joiners (Machine) 30 Outworkers 177 Miscellaneous 75 Total 1,219 It is obvious that without a special inspector for the duties, it would not be practicable to at all efficiently carry out the work imposed upon your Council under the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901. ICE CREAM DEALERS. The London County Council (General Powers') Act. 1902, which came into operation on the 1st November, 1902, by Part VIII. made provision for the regulation, manufacture, and sale of ice cream or other similar commodities, as follows:— Any person being a manufacturer of or merchant or dealer in ice creams or other similar commodity who within the County— (a) Causes or permits ice creams or any similar commodity to be manufactured sold or stored in any cellar 193 shed or room in which there is any inlet or opening to a drain or which is used as a living room or sleeping room; (b) In the manufacture sale or storage of any such commodity does any act or thing likely to expose such commodity to infection or contamination or omits to take any proper precaution for the due protection of such commodity from infection or contamination; or (c) Omits on the outbreak of any infectious disease amongst the persons employed in his business or living or working in on or about the premises in or on any part of which any such commodity as aforesaid is manufactured sold or stored to give notice thereof forthwith to the Medical Officer of the Sanitary District in which such business is carried on or such premises are situate; shall be liable for every such offence on conviction in a Court of Summary Jurisdiction to a penalty not exceeding Forty Shillings. Every itinerant vendor of any such commodity as aforesaid shall if not himself the manufacturer thereof exhibit in a legible manner on a conspicuous part of his barrow a notice stating the name and address of the person from whom he obtains such commodity and if such vendor is himself the manufacturer of such commodity he shall in the same manner exhibit his own name and address. Every such itinerant vendor who shall fail to comply with the provisions of this Section shall be liable for each offence on conviction as aforesaid to a penalty not exceeding Forty Shillings. Proceedings for the recovery of the penalties shall be instituted by the Sanitary Authority for the District in which the offence was committed or of the District to the Medical Officer of which such notification as aforesaid ought to have been made or in which such itinerant vendor as aforesaid shall offer any such commodity as aforesaid for sale as the case may be. The duty of obtaining the necessary information for the registration of premises upon which ice creams are made has been carried out by Sanitary Inspector S. Huggons Brown. At the present time there are 141 premises upon the register and 67 notices have been served, all of which have been complied with. N 194 DAIRIES, COWSHEDS, AND MILKSHOPS ORDER, Etc. The total number of persons registrable under the above Order, carrying on the business of dairymen or purveyors of milk 269 During the year new premises have been registered to the number of 26 During the same period the number of new occupiers applying for registration has been 19 All the premises above referred to are under regular periodical inspection. During the year three cases of infectious disease occurred upon premises where milk was sold; the regulations under the above Order appertaining to the stoppage of sale of milk, disinfection, and the granting of certificates thereafter were strictly enforced under my supervision by the Officer carrying out the transferred duties. SUMMONSES ORDERED. During last year your Council and the Public Health Committee gave authority for 45 summonses to be taken out against persons for having failed to comply with the requirements of notices which had been served. In most cases before summonses were issued a letter was written to the person in default, informing him that the Public Health Committee had ordered the summons, and asking him if he was willing to give an undertaking in writing that he would forthwith comply with the notice which had been served. In many instances the undertaking was at once given, and it was not found to be necessary to apply for a summons. It has been the object of the department, as heretofore, to take out as few summonses as possible, but at the same time in no instance to allow anyone to defy the authority of your Council. During last year 25 summonses were taken out through the Public Health Department. The following HAM7 195 is a list of the premises in reference to which summonses were issued, with a statement as to the nature of the complaint and the result of the proceedings:— SUMMONSES. Situation of Premises. Nature of offence. Result of Proceedings. Glen Laundry, Starch Green, 4 Summonses Nuisance from black smoke Summonses dismissed on technical grounds, but without costs.

N2 196 PUBLIC MORTUARY. During last year 182 bodies were removed to the mortuary at Fulham Palace Road. Four of these were of persons who had died of infectious disease, and were removed by your Council. There were also 144 bodies brought to the mortuary by order of the Coroner or the Police; 40 of these were taken from the West London Hospital and 34 bodies were received for accommodation. PUBLIC NUISANCES. During last year I had occasion to bring before your Public Health Committee a complaint in reference to an alleged Public Nuisance, viz.: an accumulation of stagnant water on the vacant land at the end of Cobbold Road and abutting on the Warple Way leading from Uxbridge Road to Bedford Park. The complaint had the usual careful consideration of your Public Health Committee. METEOROLOGY. The average mean temperature registered in London during last year was 50°1 Fahrenheit. The highest temperature registered was 87°5 in July. The lowest temperature was 23°6 in January. Rain fell on 179 days. The total amount of rainfall was 35·54 inches. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, N. C. COLLIER, l.r.c.p., l.s.a., Medical Officer of Health.
