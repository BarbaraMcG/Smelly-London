Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Health and Sanitary Condition of the Borough for the year 1931. This is a census year, and information gleaned from the Census Reports as published has been used, especially in the housing section of the report. The change in density (room occupation) is largely a consequence of the reductions in the size of families. The death-rate for the year was 12.0 per 1,000 inhabitants, as against 12.1 in the previous year. The infantile mortality rate was 04, the rate for the previous year being 70. Smallpox, although it continued during the year, did not reach the same height of 1930, there being 66 cases, as against 244 in 1930. I desire to thank the Chairmen and the Members of the Council and Committees for the keen interest taken in the work of the department; and the Superintendent and members of my staff generally for their ready help in all the work. Your obedient servant, Medical Officer of Health, REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health FOR THE YEAR 1931.

During the year ending December 31st, 1931, the attendances at this Day Nursery were :— Whole Day 11,885 Half Day 584 INVALID CHILDREN'S AID ASSOCIATION. The Borough Council contributes £25 per annum to the Local Branch of this Association. During the year ended 31st December, 1931, 65 Islington children under five years were given periods of convalescence either in the country or by the sea, and 21 children of like ages, crippled, were provided with surgical appliances, splints, special boots, etc. REPORT OF THE WORK OF VOLUNTARY CENTRES. North Centre.—This Centre issues a general review of the work, but does not include a special medical report. The activities of the various Departments are summarised thus :—1. Three (sometimes four) Ante-natal Clinics weekly ; 2. One Post-natal Clinic weekly for mothers; 3. Ten Children's Clinics weekly (Consultations for children up to five years of age); 4. Visiting (professional and voluntary) daily in the homes; 5. Morning Callers daily (mothers that come for advice) ; 6. Eleven Dental Sessions weekly. Two, sometimes three, Centre Dental Sessions weekly. A Dental Club ; 7. Three Massage Clinics weekly; 8. Sewing Classes weekly; 9. Many Health Talks weekly; 10. The training of Infant Welfare Students; 11 ; The training of thirteen Infant Welfare Pupils (L.C.C. and M.C.C. Scholarship holders); 12. Five Home Helps and a Home Helps' Club; 13. A Thrift Club and branch of National Savings Association; 14. A Convalescent Fund; 15. Mothers' Committee and Fathers' Committee ; 16. " Light " Clinics daily ; 17. Four Wards (three wards for ailing children under two years of age, and one for three mothers with their babies); 18. Statistical Records. The possession of Wards at this Centre is of special value, not only on account of the work done there, but because of its educational influence on the mothers, as well as for the training of Students and pupils. The Centre gives a course of training in infant care, lasting from three to six months. The Infant Welfare Students attending this course are given a certificate at the conclusion of their attendance and work has been satisfactory. 18 1931] It is noted that arrangements have been made wtih the London County Council by which six new Scholarships will be awarded each year (two in each of the three terms) irrespective as to whether the present total of twelve will be exceeded or not. Five Home Helps, specially trained at the Centre, are employed to go into homes and do the work of the mothers during their confinements, etc. The mothers pay weekly sums into the Club for the use of a Home Help when needed. The midwives in North Islington are in close co-operation with the work of the Centre and especially its Ante-natal Department. For many years this Centre has lent scales to mothers for seven or more consecutive days in order that they might weigh their babies at home before and after each feed. This has been done to supplement the Medical Officer's enquiry as to the mother's capacity to feed her child, the one test feed given at the Centre not being in itself a sufficient guide. In connection with the Ante-natal Clinics, if a mother is in real want, a good mid-day meal is given at the Centre. 1,509 dinners were provided during the Centre year, as against 151 in 1930-31. The increasing number has been due to the general lack of employment. It has been decided by the Committee of this Centre to retain the " Light " work. This decision has been come to largely on the medical reports of the excellent results which have been obtained. South Centre.—In the medical report of the year's work for this Centre for the year ending 31st March, 1932, it is noted that there has been a falling off in the incidence of minor ailments. This has been in progress for some little time, as it has been noticed for two or three years back. As an instance of the improved standard in the home care of infants, cases with rashes and septic spots have been much reduced in number. It has also been noticed that there has been a marked improvement in the clothing of children, fewer garments are used, which are changed oftener. While formerly it was the exception to have a separate garment for the child at night, this is now provided by the mother. The proper washing of garments is now noticed as the result of the influence of the Centre's teaching, and the provision of soft knitted vests and knickers is now common. Skin conditions generally, as also the rashes and septic spots already mentioned, have diminished; there are fewer sore ears and cases of chilblains, which is ascribed to the improved clothing and better care of the children. It is noted that this Centre also ascribes some of the improvement to the extensive use of cod liver oil, etc., during the winter months. That the educational work of the Centre has been shown to have been effective is proved by the facts observed on the attendance of the mothers after the second baby. The hygienic advice given is reflected in them, and it is well seen on their second attendance that the trouble spent with them on the first occasion has been fruitful. The " Rose " Branch of this Centre is stated to have attracted a number of new mothers from the tenements which surround it, and one of the weekly antenatal consultations is now held at this Branch. During the winter the Centre distributed to the mothers, at cost price, good nourishing broth, which had been prepared by the Islington Branch of the Invalid Kitchens' Association, for the toddlers' dinners. 19 [1931 78 mothers and 85 children were sent for convalescence to Flamstead, being 10 more mothers and 11 more children than that in the previous year, and in addition 9 mothers and 65 children were sent to the seaside, while 16 children were enabled to obtain convalescence elsewhere. East Centre.—The medical report of the East Centre states that there has been a diminution in the number of cases of rickets and marasmus and other diseases of malnutrition among those attending and the Centre realises the importance of keeping in touch with the toddler until school age is reached. Special mention is made of the importance of breast-feeding and the test-feeding carried out at the Centre to enable the best advice to be given to mothers. The attendance of the mothers is good and they make considerable efforts, in the great majority of cases, to carry out the advice and instruction given. In the autumn Dr. Evelyn Lucas, from the Child Guidance Clinic, gave lectures on the following:—"The Jealous Child," "The Nervous Child," "Disobedience," and " Promises." In addition, the Milk Publicity Council gave a lecture on " Food Values " and two cooking demonstrations. The provision of material for research in the special investigation of the Board of Education in regard to Tonsils and Adenoids was continued. Special funds were raised to deal with the acute poverty which was so much in evidence in the winter months, and a number of the poorest cases were relieved. At this Centre early symptoms of squint have been sent for special treatment to Ophthalmic Hospitals, so that every effort may be made to avoid development, and thus obviate the necessity for glasses or after treatment of the established disability. West Centre.— The medical report of this Centre draws attention to the depressed state of industry and industrial conditions generally with the consequent hardship. The number of babies treated in the Ward was 82, one more than last year. There were two cases which ended fatally as against 4 in the previous year. The total number of attendances has increased. The " Light " Clinic was continued during the year. 20 1931] The various Departments of the Four Voluntary Centres, with the attendances for 1931, may be summarised thus :— North. South. East. West.

(Exclusive of Tuberculosis and Influenza.) These diseases, which include Chronic and Acute Bronchitis, Pneumonia, Pleurisy and Asthma, caused 738 deaths, or 90 more than in 1930. They were equal to a death.rate of 2.3 per 1,000 of the civil population, and represented 18.0 per cent, of the total deaths registered in the Borough. Acute Bronchitis..— There were 207 deaths as compared with 118 in the previous year, 85 occurred among males, and 122 among females. The deaths of 14 infants under 12 months were registered. Chronic Bronchitis.— 109 deaths were ascribed to it, 69 being males and 40 females. This return is 29 above that for 1930. Pneumonia (All forms).— 387 deaths were registered, of which 21(3 were males and 171 females, and were 19 above the year 1930. 71 infants under a year old cliecl from this disease, while between the ages of 1 and 5 years 36 died from it. Above 5 years of age the deaths numbered 280. 182 deaths occurred in Public Institutions, chiefly the Islington Hospitals Pleurisy.— There were 14 deaths registered from this disease, 9 deaths occurred in Public Institutions. Asthma and Emphysema— 9 deaths were recorded from these diseases, all were adults. Other Diseases of the Respiratory System.— 12 deaths were registered, as contrasted with 14 in 1930. VENEREAL DISEASES. Twelve deaths were ascribed to these diseases, as compared with 11 in 1930. Of these, 9 were males and 3 females. They were 2 below the mean deaths (14) of the preceding ten years 1921.30. The three groups of ages at death were as follows:— Under 1 year, 5 deaths; 1.5 years, no death ; and over 5 years, 7 deaths. The nearest treatment centres of these diseases are the Royal Northern Hospital, Holloway Road, N., and the Royal Free Hospital, Gray's Inn Road, W.C.I. A complete list is exhibited in the public conveniences under the control of the Council. Information and leaflets are distributed on application by letter or otherwise by the Medical Officer of Health, and if desired, he personally advises applicants as to what they should do to secure the necessary confidential treatment. Applicants of both sexes have taken advantage of these facilities for information. Mr. George Jewsbury, 39, Kelvin Road, N.5, the Secretary of the local branch of the British Social Hygiene Council, has supplied me with the following list of activities during the year. 1931] 28 Meeting held at Caledonian Road Baths was well attended by both men and women. Address given by Dr. Feldman. Open Air Meetings with good results were held at Highbury Corner on May 28th, June 25th, July 16th and August 7th. Dr. Feldman addressed "The Rotarians " on the work and purpose of the British Social Hygiene Council during the year. DEATHS FROM COAL.GAS POISONING. During the year 19 deaths were registered from asphyxia caused by the inhalation of carbon.monoxide gas. Thirteen deaths from the same cause occurred in 1930. Eighteen of these deaths were attributable to suicide, while the cause of the remaining death was accidental, which was investigated at the request of the Ministry of Health. Of the 19 deaths, 13 were males and (6 females, the ages ranging from 25 to 75 years. ACCIDENTAL DEATHS. The deaths due to accident numbered 132. Of this number 50 deaths were ascribed to vehicular traffic and 45 to accidental falls, including 42 aged people. The 50 deaths due to accidents in vehicular traffic may be summarised as follows:— Motor Car Other or Lorry. Bus or Tram. Taxi.cab. Vehicles. Total. 32 5 — 13 50 Of this number, 2 deaths occurred to Islington residents when in outlying districts. In addition to these, 18 non.residents were also killed by vehicles within the borough. INQUESTS AND MORTUARY. During the year 230 bodies were received into the Mortuary, as compared with an average of 296 in the preceding 10 years. Only two infectious bodies were received during the year. The daily average number of bodies received was 0.6, whilst in 1930 the average was 0.7. In 65 cases inquests were held, as contrasted with an average of 268 in the ten years 1921.30.

PREVENTION OF INFECTION. Notification, Isolation, Fatality, or Specified Diseases under the Provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The Principal Diseases Include:— Small Pox, Diphtheria, Scarlet Fever, Enteric Fever, Typhus Fever, Puerperal Fever and Erysipelas. 2,111 cases of the principal diseases which are notifiable under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, came to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health. This number does not include other communicable ailments, which are also notifiable. The complete list of infectious diseases which are notifiable in Islington will be found on page 35. The total cases notified are 946 less than those of the previous year (3,057), and 335 below the average (2,446) of the preceding ten years. The decreases when contrasted with the decennial averages are to be found in the returns from Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria, which were respectively 205 and 2(54 below the average, while Erysipelas, Puerperal Fever and Membraneous Croup showed increases of 52, 15 and 1 respectively on the ten years' average. The 2,111 cases were equal to an attack.rate of (i.50 per 1,000 of the civil population. The returns for the preceding ten years are given in the following ments:— Attack-rates per 1,000 civil population. Year.

In March, summonses were issued by the Islington Borough Council against a restaurant keeper, and a doctor practising in the Borough. The restaurant Keeper was summoned as the head of the family on the charge that " being aware that his boy was suffering from an infectious disease, Diphtheria, he failed to send notice to the Medical Officer of Health under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891." The doctor was summoned as a medical practitioner attending a patient suffering from an infectious disease, for failing to send forthwith to the Medical Officer of Health the certificate required under section 55 of the same Act. The circumstances were that the doctor, being called in to see the child, took a swab from the throat and sent it to the Medical Officer of Health. On receiving the report, he saw the parent at the home and informed him that the child was suffering from Diphtheria. He gave him a certificate addressed to the Medical Officer of Health and told him to take it to the Town Hall. Four days later the child was seen in the streets, and the Medical Officer of Health received a complaint, and an investigation was made. The Sanitary Inspector called at the parent's house, and finding no one at home, went to the restaurant, where the child was found playing with other children. The parent admitted having received a certificate from the doctor and to having failed to forward it to the Medical Officer of Health, as directed. He appears to have consulted another doctor, and omitted to tell him that the child had already been medically seen or that a swab had been taken and a cerificate already issued. The second doctor thus in ignorance of the facts said the child had tonsillitis. The Islington Borough Council considered that it was not their function to apportion the blame, but simply to lay the facts before the Court for the Msgistrate's decision. It was admitted that certificates were sometimes sent to the Public Health Department by the parents and that this procedure had the advantage of getting the department in personal contact with the parents, thus preventing delay. The parent pleaded guilty to the charge and was fined 40/. and costs. The Magistrate expressed surprise that this was the maximum penalty he might inflict. The doctor pleaded not guilty on the ground that the words in the Act were " send a certificate to the Medical Officer of Health." No method of sending the certificate was laid down, and he submitted it was sufficient to send by the parent. The Magistrate ruled that the handing to the parent was not sufficient sending of the notice within the terms of section 55 of the Act. There was a definite responsibility laid upon the practitioner. He dismissed the practitioner from the case under the Probation of Offenders Act, remarking that the case had been properly and fairly put forward and public attention called to the matter, 31 [1931 SMALL.POX. Of the confirmed cases, numbering 64, five had been vaccinated in infancy, but at least 20 years had elapsed in every case since vaccination. The unvaccinated cases numbered 59. (In addition to these Islington cases, five residents of the Borough of Finsbury were notified from Archway Hospital, four of which proved to be Smallpox. The disease in these cases showed itself after the admission of the patients). Over half the infection was caused by an outbreak in Thornhill Road L.C.C. School, where 23 children were infected, and 11 other cases were traced directly to cont.act with these children. With the consent of the Medical Officer of Health the Public Vaccinator for the district attended by arrangement with the school authorities at Thornhill Road School to enable vaccination to be more expeditiously carried out when the consent of the parents had been obtained. While probably more vaccinations were done owing to the convenience afforded, the response of the parents to this offer of free vaccination of their children was, on the whole, a poor one in view of the proportions this outbreak attained. One would have thought more than 28 would have come forward. As regards the other cases apart from the school infection, there were 30 verified cases, four infected by contact with cases in other Boroughs, two infections in the hop.fields, one in the workplace, and in the others the primary infection was not definitely traced. A Table is given of classification as to the source of infection in the cases. Classification as to source of infection. Infection from previous cases 24 Infection from common lodging.houses — Infection from school 24 Smallpox in neighbourhood — Infection from workplace 1 Infection not traced 7 Contact with cases in other Boroughs 4 Infection in Hop Fields 2 Infection from hospital — Infection possibly from "missed" case 2 Unverified cases 2 Total 66 The type of Smallpox has continued as before to be of the extremely mild type known as Variola minor, and in common with other boroughs the procedure of surveillance which was adopted in former years for the severe Asiatic form of the disease has been modified in accordance with modern opinion and the continued mildness of the cases. Close contacts are kept under observation by periodic visitation at their homes and enquiries from the responsible persons as to their health. Should anything be amiss, the matter is reported to the Medical Officer of Health for his personal consideration. Unless circumstances are exceptional, visits to the homes of contacts are confined to the usual office hours. The surveillance of contacts at workplaces has been discontinued. Information that an individul has developed Smallpox is still given to the employer if he works in Islington, but if he works outside the Borough, the Medical Officer of Health of 32 1931] that district is communicated with. The result of this procedure is to avoid as far as possible loss of employment amongst presumed Smallpox contacts, and to enahle the stair of the Public Health Department, apart from special and exceptional cases, to limit their duties to the usual office hours.

DIPHTHERIA ANTI-TOXIN; IMMUNISATION. Under the Special Order of 15th August, 1910, the then Local Government Board sanctioned the provision by the Sanitary Authority, in pursuance of section 77 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, of a temporary supply of Diphtheria Anti-toxin "for the poorer inhabitants of the district, subject to the following conditions, that is to say, the arrangements with respect to the keeping, distribution and use of the Diphtheria Anti-toxin shall be made in accordance with the advice of the Medical Officer of Health." The section of the Public Health Act referred to is that which enables the authority with the sanction of the Local Government Board to provide a temporary supply of medicine, etc., for the poorer inhabitants of their district. (See also page 37. Applications in respect of 4 children were received for Diphtheria immunisation (Schick Test) during the year. 33 [1931 ANTI-TOXIN TREATMENT. During the year 68,000 units of Diphtheria Anti-toxin serum were issued to Medical Practitioners in the Borough. Of this quantity 18,000 units were sold, the total amount received by the Council being 17s. 2d. The remaining 50,000 units were given free, owing to the patients' limited means. Scarlet Fever.— 1.093 cases were notified, and they showed a decrease of 205 on the average (1,298) of the ten years 1921.30. The attack-rate was equal to 3.37 per 1,000 of the civil population annually, which is a decrease of 0.54 per 1,000 of the mean rate (3.91) of the preceding ten years. In London the attack. rate was 2.8 per 1,000 of the civil population. Enteric Fever.— 16 cases were notified which were equal to the average that obtained during the ten years 1921.30. The attack.rate was 0.05 per 1,000 annually, equal to the mean rate of the last ten years. In London the rate was 0.04. Typhus Fever.— No case was notified. Puerperal Fever.— See page 13. Erysipelas,— 177 cases were notified, and were 52 above the average of the preceding ten years, the attack.rate being 0.54 per 1,000 of the civil population. FATALITY FROM THE PRINCIPAL NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. By "Fatality" is meant the percentage proportion of deaths to attacks of sickness. During the year it was found that of the 2,111 cases notified, 43 deaths occurred, or 2.04 per cent., which contrasts with an average percentage of 2.8 in the preceding ten years 1921.30.

Under Section 77 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, a temporary supply of medicine, etc., for the poorer inhabitants of a district may with the sanction of the Minister of Health, be made. Under this section, the Minister on the 9th December, 1929, granted authority to the Islington Borough Council to make such provision for the poorer inhabitants. The sanction was given provisionally for a period of twelve months, and was extended for a further period of 12 months. It is laid down by the Minister that practitioners applying for supplies of Insulin should state:— (a) the name and address, age and sex of each patient for whom it is wanted, and (b) to furnish a quarterly report in respect of each patient treated, giving the following information:— (1) The number of doses of Insulin administered; (2) Whether any tests were made of the urine or of the blood of the patient, and, if so, by whom and with what results. 38 1931] The Minister of Health has to be furnished with a quarterly report by the Medical Officer of Health giving an abstract of the reports forwarded by the medical practitioners, the cost of the Insulin supplied by the Borough Council, and any general remarks as to the working of the arrangements. So far the demand for such assistance for patients comes through the Almoners of two of the largest hospitals. During the year under review 8 cases have received this assistance from the Borough Council, the cost of the Insulin supplied being £18 19s. 0d. BLIND PERSONS ACT, 1920. In October a copy of the Revised Scheme, dated 21st July, 1931, for the Welfare of Blind Persons in the County of London, which had been approved by the Ministry of Health, was received from the London County Council. Under this Scheme it is now necessary also to report cases of " Partial " blindness in children under five years of age coming to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health. Subsequently a communication was received from the London County Council stating that the Metropolitan Society for the Blind, 296, Vauxhall Bridge Road, S.W.I, was acting on their behalf in this matter. 2 children "totally" blind and 5 children "partially" blind, making 7 cases in all, have been under supervision this year. (See also Annual Report, 1930, page 42). TUBERCULOSIS. 588 cases of Tuberculosis in its different forms were notified during the year. The attack-rate was equal to 1.81 per 1,000 of the civil population. This number was a decrease of 2 on the return of the previous year, and of 0.03 per 1,000 on the attack-rate. Respiratory (Pulmonary) Tuberculosis— 497 notifications were received, of which 236 referred to males and 261 to females, and represented an attack-rate of 1.53 per 1,000 inhabitants.

PUBLIC HEALTH (TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS, 1925. These Regulations provide that no person suffering from respiratory tuberculosis who is in an infective condition shall be engaged in any form of dairy work involving the milking of cows, the treatment of milk, or the handling of containers. No case has come to the notice of the Medical Officer of Health during the year which calls for action. ISLINGTON INTERIM TUBERCULOSIS CARE COMMITTEE. The character of the work of this Committee was fully exemplified in the Medical Officer of Health's Annual Report for 1929, page 39, when individual cases and methods of help were given. See also Report 1930, page 44. Handicraft Classes.— This class, which started in 1930, still continues very successful, and the year 1931 has seen an increase in membership and a marked improvement in the standard of the work. 40 1931] It is satisfactory to note that Islington was allocated a place in the Handicraft Exhibition at the Carpenter's Hall in April. Practically all the exhibits were sold, and £3 10s. 0d. was realised and orders taken. Allotment Scheme.— In August of this year a start was made with an allotment scheme to give the patients occupation in the open air and at the same time grow vegetables for themselves and their families. The allotment plots are at Banowell Green. Two ten pole plots were leased. The National Association for the Prevention of Consumption made a donation of £10, and other assistance came from members of the Committee. 1931. 1930.

The provisions of these Regulations continue to be systematically carried out with regard to the Register of Notified Cases of Tuberculosis. A quarterly revision of the Register is made by the removal of the names of patients who have died, left the district, and those, who in the opinion of the Tuberculosis Officer, confirmed by the L.C.C. Medical Officer, should be denotified. The following is a statistical statement showing the number of cases of Notified Tuberculosis on the register at the commencement of the year, the numbers, removed during that period, and the actual number remaining the close of the year, 1931 (i.e., ending 2nd January, 1932):— Lungs.

The number is a decrease of 753 on that of the preceding year. It was, however, 230 above the decennial average. Of the total examinations, 413, or 14.7 per cent, gave positive results. Diphtheria.—1,943 specimens were examined for Diphtheria, of which 280, or 14.4 per cent., were found to contain Diphtheria bacilli. Enteric Fever. —10 specimens of blood were examined, 2 of which gave positive results. Tuberculosis.—858 specimens of sputum were examined, 131, or 15.3 per cent., of which showed that the patients were suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis.

During the year 1931, six samples of milk were taken in various parts of the Borough, as supplied to the consumer. In addition to the bacterial count to see whether the specimen complied with the Grade, if any, under which it was sold, the specimens were examined for tubercule bacilli by animal inoculation. All the samples fulfilled the standard bacteriological requirements. Two samples, however, seemed only to have been made suitable by pasteurisation. No evidence of tubercle bacilli was found in any of these specimens. VACCINATION. During the year Dr. Hynes resigned his position as Public Vaccinator for Tufnell, and Dr. D. W. Latham, 18, Mercers Road, N.19, was appointed. Dr. H. E. Whitehead, the Public Vaccinator for very many years for East Lower Holloway, and a much esteemed practitioner in the borough, died on the 1st September, 1930. Dr. F. E. Clay, who succeeded him in his practice, was appointed his successor as Public Vaccinator. No vaccinations were performed by the Medical Officer of Health under the Public Health (Smallpox Prevention) Regulations, 1917, as it was possible to refer each case immediately to the Public Vaccinator of the district or institution. Vaccinations.—Of the 4,465 births registered in 1930, the returns of vaccination shows that only 2,181 infants were successfully vaccinated, while 18 were found to be insusceptible. There were also 205 who died unvaccinated, and 1,584 statutory declarations of conscientious objection to vaccination were obtained by the parents or guardians; 39 vaccinations were postponed under medical authority; 372 were removed to other districts or places unknown, thus leaving 66 unaccounted for. The return of certificates of exemption, therefore, represents 35 per cent, of the registered births. Vaccination per 100 Years. births, less infants who died unvaccinated. 1921 44.9 1922 46.3 1923 54.8 1924 540 1925 50.4 1926 51 .5 1927 49. 9 1928 46.5 1929 49 .5 1930 51.2 Certificates of Exemption.—The following tabular statement shows the decrease in number of these certificates in recent years :— 1921 2,506 1922 2,347 1923 1,751 1924 1,755 1925 1,973 1926 1,896 1927 1,845 1928 1,755 1929 1,642 1930 1,584 1931] 48 Return furnished by the Vaccination Officers respecting the Vaccination of Children in the Sub-Registration Districts during the previous year 1930.

Disinfection of Rooms.—3,323 rooms were disinfected, as contrasted with 4,897 in 1930. For this purpose formaldehyde in solution was employed, although it was sometimes augmented by sulphur fumigation, when it was necessary to kill vermin, for which purpose sulphur has been found effective. For the extermination of bugs, in addition all the architrave mouldings and skirting boards behind which they breed are removed, and the walls washed with hot lime, and in certain cases special insecticide fluids were employed. The above figures also include the disinfection of houses and rooms after Tuberculosis, vide p. 41.

Disinfestation of School Children (Cleansing from lice and other vermin) —During the year 5,408 (including 577 for Scabies) baths were given to children from the London County Council Schools, who attended the Disinfecting Station, and were cleansed by the nurse whom the Borough Council appointed for the work, while their clothing was undergoing disinfestation. j 51 [1931 The amount paid during the year by the London County Council for the baths given to the children was £511 19s. 0d. Proceedings were instituted by the London County Council under Section 122 of the Children Act, 1908, in 90 instances during the year.

Particulars are required in the Annual Report of any extension or improvement during the year of methods of scavenging or refuse disposal, and a statement as to the character and efficiency of the arrangements for the removal and disposal of house refuse. Mr. H. F. Wigfield, the Borough Cleansing Superintendent, has kindly supplied me with the following statement :— (1) Street Sweeping.—No material alteration has taken place with regard to the mileage of the streets swept during 1931 as compared with the previous year. (2) Two “ Karrier” petrol Motor Sweepers and Sprinklers were purchased and put into commission during the year to take the place of two “Laffly” sweeping brooms which had been in service since the middle of 1921. (3) Two “Shelvoke and Drewry” totally-enclosed low-loading 3-ton refuse collection vehicles were purchased and put into commission during the year. (4) The method of refuse collection is on the same principle as for the past few years. During 1931 81% was collected by mechanical vehicles and 19% by horses and vans, the same percentage as for 1930. (5) In November, 1931, a new 5 years' contract was entered into for the disposal of house and trade refuse. The material is, as formerly, sent to the contractor's dumps at Blackridge and Holwell, Hyde, Hertfordshire, where it is deposited in layers of approximately 6 feet in depth, each layer being covered with 9 inches of soil, and otherwise treated in accordance with the Ministry of Health's recommendations. (6) The arrangements for both collection and disposal of refuse are, I think, generally satisfactory, and compare favourably with those which exist in other Boroughs. During the year the Medical Officer of Health visited the contractor's dumps in Hertfordshire to obtain first-hand information as to the conditions under which the disposal of refuse was being carried out. REMOVAL OF DUST. 36 applications were received during the year by the Public Health Department for the removal of dust. The applications received for the previous ten years were as follows :— 1921 21 1926 20 1922 15 1927 25 1923 16 1928 25 1924 33 1929 21 1925 21 1930 40 Dust Receptacles Provided.—During the year 1,402 dust receptacles were provided by owners of property under notice. 55 [1931 DISTRICT INSPECTORS' WORK. During- the year the fourteen district inspectors made a total of 50,700 inspections and calls, a decrease of 3,303 inspections on the corresponding period of 1930; while 12,815 improvements were effected in 5,299 premises; as against 12,069 improvements in 5,474 premises for the preceding year. Synopsis of Inspectors' Work.—The following statement gives a brief synopsis of the district inspectors' work in 1931 :— House to house inspections 3,329 Other inspections of dwelling houses 4,284 Re-inspections and calls made 40,802 Visits of inquiry re notifiable infectious diseases 2,111 Butchers' shops, stalls, etc. (Saturday nights) 61 Ice cream shops and factories 168 Dairies and Milkshops 853 Stables and yards 588 Urinals attached to Public Houses 217 Smoke observations 118 Notices Served—There were 4,693 intimation notices served by the inspectors with respect to nuisances. In 536 instances it became necessary, as the intimations to owners or occupiers of the properties had been ignored, to report the nuisances to the Public Health Committee, who ordered statutory notices to be served. Verminous Premises—Bedding and Clothing.—96 rooms which were found to be in a verminous condition were fumigated. In 22 instances it was necessary to remove the bedding and clothing to the Disinfecting Station for purification or destruction. Rag Flock Acts, 1911 and 1928.—In the routine inspections, the Sanitary Inspectors found no cause for action to be taken. Smoke Nuisances.—154 complaints of smoke issuing from factory chimneys in the Borough were investigated, and as a result 118 observations were made by the District Inspectors, and 86 notices served upon the owners of the businesses requiring the abatement of the nuisance. In one case it was, however, found necessary to institute legal proceedings, when a conviction was obtained and a penalty of £5 5s. Od. imposed. Water Certificates.—Eight water certificates were granted in accordance with the provisions of sec. 48 (2) Public Health (London) Act, 1921, in respect of 11 separate tenements newly erected or rebuilt during the year. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE (GRADING AND MARKING) ACT, 1928. MERCHANDISE MARKS ACT, 1926. All the Sanitary Inspectors are officially appointed for this work. The special inspections for this particular duty under, the Merchandise Marks Act and under the Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marking) Act, numbered 240. 1931] 56 15 prosecutions were taken under the Merchandise Marks Act, 1926, two of these being in respect of separate offences by one person, in which instance the Magistrate dismissed the second summons, and apother case was dismissed under the Probation of Offenders Act. For full list see page 92, and summary, page 79. No premises have been registered for the cold storage or chemical storage of eggs. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE (GRADING AND MARKING) ACT, 1928. During the year some additions were made to the list, and at the end of the year Regulations were in force applicable to:—apples and pears, beef, broccoli, canned fruits and vegetables, cherries, cider, eggs, glasshouse grown tomatoes and cucumbers, malt flour and malt extract, potatoes, poultry (dressed), strawberries, wheat flour. MERCHANDISE MARKS ACT, 1926. At the end of 1931 Orders were in force relating to apples (fresh), currants, sultanas and raisins, eggs in shell and dried eggs, honey, malt produce, oat products, salmon and sea trout, tomatoes (raw). WIDOWS', ORPHANS' AND OLD AGE (CONTRIBUTORY) PENSIONS ACT, 1925. Since these powers were delegated by the London County Council, no case has arisen so far under Section 6, so none falls to be reported on in 1931. The Section deals with the special provisions as to additional allowances and Orphans' Pensions, and in certain cases the Orphan's Pension payable in respect of a child would in the interest of the child be administered by the local authority or some other person for the benefit of the child, where a representation is made to the Minister by the local authority, or otherwise. 57 [1931 Summary of Sanitary Work from Inspectors' Reports for the year 1931.

The houses which come under the operation of the bye-laws received 986 inspections during the year, followed by 5,363 subsequent re-inspections and calls, so that the total visits amounted to 6,349. These inspections resulted in 590 intimations being served on the persons responsible, which were followed by 113 statutory notices to demand the abatement of the nuisances discovered by the Inspectors especially engaged upon this work. 13 summonses were issued for non-compliance with Statutory Notices. In 7 cases Orders were made for the work to be done in specified periods. In 5 cases fines were inflicted and in one case the summons was withdrawn as the nuisance had been abated. The amount of fines and costs in these cases totalled:—Fines, £28 2s. 0d., and costs, £20 9s. 0d. One summons was issued for illegally letting an underground room as a dwelling and the defendant was fined £1 1s. 0d. Altogether 2,743 improvements were effected in 567 premises.

See page 60, Medical Officer of Health's Report for 1929, and page 70, Report for 1930. During 1931 the London County Council were still conducting experiments. RATS AND MICE (DESTRUCTION) ACT, 1919. (9 and 10 Geo. 5. Ch. 72.) This Act came into operation on the 1st January, 1920, to make further provision for the destruction of rats and mice. Sanction was given by the Public Health Committee for expenditure on posters and rat poison. Transpariencies were exhibited in the lower basement and upper floors of the Town Hall, where the Public Health Department has offices. As last year, 300 large posters were ordered and these were exhibited throughout the Borough, but in addition to public bill posting, health publicity boards belonging to the department throughout the Borough were utilised. On these posters attention is drawn that disease is spread by rats and mice and that it is economical to commence their destruction before there is a large increase in their numbers when, not only is it more difficult to eradicate them, but also the cost of the damage done is much increased. The poster also deals with the removal of waste matters, which prove a harbour and a feeding ground for rats and mice, the safeguarding of food, and advises attention to ratproofing. The public are invited to call at the Public Health Department for further information or to write. 1931] 60 As regards poisons, it had been found in the past that while people reading the literature that we circulated regarding rats were willing enough to accept poison free, they demurred to give as much as Is. 6d. for the poison that was being distributed. An opportunity was taken of introducing tubes of rat poison to sell at 6d., and it was found—to use a hackneyed phrase—that this met a “felt want”; a number of these, in the case of poorer persons were distributed free. The demand for the smaller, and proportionately cheaper, variety of rat poison has well justified its introduction, and we had to order a further supply. It has naturally decreased the demand for the dearer quality, of which less was disposed of. The Ministry's leaflet was also distributed to enquirers. Tne Sanitary Inspectors investigated, as a result of the enquiries, an increased number of cases of rat infestation and advice was given; this year, as in the previous year, we found that the number of enquirers has increased, as indicated. The demand for poison also showed an increase.

Under this Order proceedings were taken against 15 individuals or firms, in one case there being two summonses. Most of the summonses were for the despicable practice of filling milk bottles, and as often as not, uncleansed milk bottles, with milk in the streets. In spite of frequent warnings the habit of doing this, which is contrary to the law, persists, the individuals taking the risk when they think they are safe, presuming no Inspector is about. It is obvious such craftiness in avoiding the law is difficult to detect, and from the number of cases discovered one must presume that only a very small proportion are found out. One company (previously convicted in 1929) was fined £20 and ordered to pay £5 5s. Od. costs for failing to cause a churn to be thoroughly cleansed. The summon; of course was only taken in respect of one churn. The other summonses were mainly for carrying on the trade of dairyman or purveyor of milk without being registered. The complete list of prosecutions will be found on pages 90, 91. HOUSING. REPORT BY THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH ON THE INSPECTION OF CERTAIN PROPERTIES IN THE BOROUGH. The following properties have been individually examined, and detailed schedules made of the premises giving the exact particulars of the conditions and surroundings at the time of inspection. 61 [1931 Ellenborough Road, Nos. 8 to 32.—13 houses, accommodating 152 persons, approximate area, 13,992 sq. feet. This series of houses is recommended for reconditioning, and that necessary steps be taken in accordance with the schedules submitted to compel the owners to make effective repairs necessary under the Housing Acts. Fairbridge Road, Nos. 169-191.—12 houses, accommodating 155 persons, approximate area, 15,360 sq. feet. These properties are similarly recommended to be dealt with in the same manner, reconditioning under the Housing Acts, the necessary notices to be served on the owners. Queensland Road. — This area comprises the streets in Queensland Road, Queen's Square, Victoria Place, Victoria Mews, Instow Place, Emily Place and Albany Place. There are 158 houses, chiefly let out in working-class tenements of one, two and three rooms, with a population of 926 adults and 469 children, 1,395 persons in all. One site is vacant, for a house was blown down in September, 1929. The area is approached directly from Benwell Road, and is an island site bounded on the north by the Islington Borough Council's refuse wharf, and on the east by the London and North-Eastern Railway. The houses are all aged, badly planned, poorly fitted up, many having long outlasted their term of useful service. In Queensland Road are a number of basement dwellings with dark and damp lower rooms. The roofs call for constant attention and repair, are of the valley type, tiled, with zinc-lined gutters. From other causes also dampness is largely prevalent. In a few, oil lamps are still used, no gas fittings having been provided. The staircases are generally dark, narrow and worn to a dangerous extent. Repairs are invariably done in the lowest, cheapest way possible, and are not lasting. The area contains three commercial premises, namely, Garage of Westerns Laundries, Factory of W. Barnes and Son, and the Scott Insulated Wire Co., and a Mission, the Swainson Memorial Hall. At present the approach is via Queensland Road, but by development alternative access could be found. It seems to form a place where the extension of the Borough Cleansing Depot would for future requirements be provided for. This^ therefore, would preclude its being considered with regard to the actual building of houses. 95, 97 and 99, Georges Road.—Three houses, accommodating 29 persons. These three houses stand upon a very small site, are old, and are very close to the public footpath. They are in proximity to the area represented some time ago to the London County Council, the date being 5th April, 1929, when a representation was made in respect of Georges Road, Hope Street, Eden Grove, and part of Eden Grove, formerly known as Grove Street (Hope Street area). It would not, in my opinion, be expedient to deal with this small isolated detail, for it usually happens when a housing scheme is carried out so near, there is an incentive for the adjacent portion to be brought up to approximately the standard of the new buildings, because the extra population brings more trade and other requirements, so that adjacent sites are readily taken up and improved by private enterprise. 20-54, Chalfont Road.—There are 18 houses here in one terrace, accommodating 85 adults and 27 children, 112 persons in all. The houses are in a fair state of repair, and at the back there is an area of vacant land. The number of houses here is larger than would be dealt with in a Borough Council scheme, and as stated, the condition of the houses is fair, the ground landlord having recently served schedules of dilapidations, and the leaseholds have only about two years to run. 1931] 62 8 to 40 and 50 to 56a, Hurlock Street, and Fort Cottages.—This site comprises 52 houses, one factory and one public hall, with a population of 199 persons. The area of the site is approximately 32,000 sq. feet. The site would appear to be a suitable one for the erection of block flats, but with the exception of Fort Cottages, the houses are in a very fair condition which does not preclude their being reconditioned. The vacant ground forms the tempting nature of the site. The number of the houses brings the area within the London County Council category. 9, 11, 13, 15 17 and 19, Dorset Street.—These houses, three of which are unoccupied, being in a condition which prevents their being let, form a site which is certainly small enough to bring it within a Borough Council Scheme. The population is 17 adults and 4 children at present. There is a contractor's yard adjacent, which if obtained would make the area one in which possibly more people could be accommodated in block dwellings. The site is not an island one, and in a reconstruction scheme of course the houses would possibly require to be set back. Still, the matter appears to be worth the serious consideration of the Committee if the vacant land could be reasonably obtained. 1 to 9, Dibden Street, and 1 to 20, Pickering Street.—The number of houses in this site is 29, accommodating 282 persons. The houses are recommended for reconditioning, and that the necessary steps be taken in accordance with the schedules submitted to compel the owners to make effective repairs under the Housing Acts. Vittoria Street, Henry Place, Payne Street, Vittoria Place, Half Moon Crescent and Maygood Street.—These streets total 94 houses, with a population of 751 persons, 185 of these being children. The property generally is damp, old and in a poor state of repair; the brickwork is poor, many walls bulging, and the pointing is bad. The water supply of 39 of the houses is situated in the yard of the house. The yards of Henry Place, and 29a, 29b, and la, Vittoria Street are small. The light and ventilation of the houses is fair, although some of the houses are dark. Nos. 12 and 14, Maygood Street do not admit of proper through ventilation. This area would, from its extent as regards the number of houses, come within a London County Council scheme. North Avenue.—This Avenue is shortly reported on as some mention has been made of it at a previous meeting. I would not, however, recommend this for reconstruction owing to the lay-out of the site as at present. Some of the lower rooms ground floor back are very dark owing to the small yards having been covered over. 13, 15, 17, 19, St. Clement's Street, 18-32, Cornelia Street, and 33, Barnsbury Grove.—In this area are 13 houses, accommodating 76 adults and 13 children. The houses in St. Clement's Street and Barnsbury Grove are in a very fair condition, but the Cornelia Street property is in a bad condition structurally, and each house has an underground kitchen. The Cornelia Street portion could be dealt with by application of the Housing Acts as before mentioned. Rolhery Street and Rothery Place, Church Lane and Church Grove.—There are 44 houses and 12 houses and shops in this area, with a population of 384, of whom 128 are children. Church Lane.— The whole of these premises with the exception of Church Cottage (which might be omitted from any scheme) are in a generally worn condition and many are very dilapidated. In six houses the only water supply is in the yard. Four houses have basement rooms. 63 [1931 Rothery Street, Nos. 2 to 13.—Only Nos. 8 and 10 are in a fair state of repair, the others are very old and dilapidated. Rothery Place.—The whole of these houses are very old and most are dilapidated. Church Grove.—The whole of these houses are in a dilapidated and worn condition, two of the houses being back to back with stables. G. CLARK TROTTER, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. 4th June, 1931. The Joint Meeting of the Housing and Public Health Committees on the 15th June, 1931, viewed the undermentioned premises :— (a) 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19, Dorset Street. (b) Rothery Street, Rothery Place, Church Lane and Church Grove. (c) Vittoria Street, Henry Place, Payne Street, Vittoria Place, Half Moon Crescent, and Maygood Street. (d) North Avenue and Northdown Street, and on the 17th June, 1931, viewed the following property :— (a) 8 to 40 and 50 to 56a, Hurlock Street. (b) Victoria Place, Instow Place, Emily Place and Queensland Road. (c) 13, 15, 17 and 19, St. Clement Street. (d) 18 and 32, Cornelia Street and 33, Barnsbury Grove. Representations were made by the Medical Officer of Health on the 5th April, 1929, under the Housing Act of 1925 in reference to a portion of the South side of Georges Road and an area adjacent thereto. (See Annual Report, 1929). Before the L.C.C. took definite action, however, the Housing Act of 1930 became law. It should be noted that the Medical Officer of Islington made the representation under the 1925 Act, and the technical difficulties afterwards encountered could have been avoided if action had been taken at the time. On the 18th June information was received from the London County Council in reference to the Hope Street Area that the Council, owing to a decision of the Ministry of Health, had been obliged to defer consideration of the question of dealing with the area as a clearance area under the Housing Act of 1930 until a way had been found of surmounting the legal difficulty which had arisen by the decision that a clearance of isolated blocks of insanitary houses, physically separated by houses or other buildings which are not insanitary cannot be regarded as one clearance area, but that although near to one another, they constitute several clearance areas, the test being whether the insanitary property can be encircled by a continuous and unbroken line. UNDERGROUND ROOMS AND BASEMENTS. On the 16th October the Council issued a Closing Order in respect of an underground room at No. 15, Douglas Road, Canonbury, occupied for the purpose of a sleeping place contrary to the provisions of Section 18 of the Housing Act, 1925, and Section 20 of the Housing Act, 1930. Notice as required by Section 19 of the Housing Act, 1930, had been served on the person who let the room, the lesses of the house, and the freeholder. Where applications were received for a recommendation for other accommodation on account of bad housing conditions (overcrowding, etc.), and the room or rooms were found to come within the legal category of “Underground Rooms,” 1931] 64 both the occupier and the person letting were warned by letter that when these rooms which had been illegally occupied were vacated, should they be re-let, the facts would be brought before the appropriate Committee with a view to legal proceedings being taken. ESTIMATED NUMBER OF BASEMENT ROOMS. In 1924 the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council asked from each Metropolitan Borough an estimate of the number of basement rooms. The method of estimating was as follows:—Such a return as could be made by the Sanitary Inspector walking along a street enumerating the occupied basement and making a record of the details asked. It was not to matter whether the rooms were occupied for sleeping purposes or not, and no special note was taken of basement rooms at the rear of the premises. The returns thus estimated, received from the Metropolitan Boroughs, constituted apparently the basis of the figures of the London County Council of the number of basements in London which were recently published. It was estimated by us that in Islington there were 1,460 basement dwellings with ceilings at or below the street level. In the survey referred to the character of the rooms was indicated under the following headings:— (a) Number of basements used for dwelling purposes. (b) Number of basement dwellings with ceilings at or below street level. (c) Number of basement dwellings in which the width of area in street does not exceed 3 feet. (d) Number of basement dwellings in which the width of area in street exceeds 3 feet, but does not exceed 4 feet. In the various districts in Islington the numbers were as follows :— In the various districts in Islington the numbers were as follows:— 1. Tufnell. 2. Upper Holloway. 3. Tollington. 4.

Notices were served under section 17 of the Housing Act of 1930 in respect of 2 dwelling houses. As the Council was satisfied that the houses mentioned were occupied or were of a type suitable for occupation by persons of the working classes and were unfit for human habitation, notices were served on the owners of the properties in respect of the particulars, which were set out in separate schedules. Summary of Housing from 1919 to 1931 (inclusive):— The number of houses or flats provided by the Islington Borough Council, the London County Council and by private enterprise in the Borough, was as follows:— 1919 to 1930. 1931 Total since 1919.

HOUSING RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. During the year 1931, recommendations were made to the London County Council regarding housing accommodation for "special hardship" cases. In all, 76 were recommended for special consideration. The basis on which these recommendations were made consisted of families living under overcrowded conditions, but in a number of cases ill-health of members of the family was the main reason for the support given to enable them to receive favourable consideration of their efforts to secure better housing conditions. Of the 76 cases recommended by the Medical Officer of Health, 38 of which were given on account of overcrowding, during the year:— 31 were provided with accommodation by the London County Council. 12 removed to an unknown address. 10 secured better accommodation in Islington. 23 still remained in their Islington occupation. In addtion to these 76 cases in which a "special hardship" recommendation was given, several investigations were made into cases brought to the notice of the Medical Officer of Health which called for much sympathy, but which fell short of the standard of "hardship" laid down, namely, gross overcrowding, ill-health of members of the family, and the difficulty of the separation of the sexes. In some of these cases a recommendation was given for consideration should there be any spare accommodation apart from that allocated for "special hardship" cases. Since the scheme was inaugurated in January, 1929, the total number of "special hardship" recommendations given is 216. WATER SUPPLY.

(1) Private families, classified by 'size of family, rooms occupied, and density of occupation, and (2) Table of Dwellings, Rooms and Families. In respect of room accommodation, Islington had a general average of C.41 rooms per dwelling. Housing pressure as measured by the proportion of families to dwellings, was greatest in St. Pancras, where the average was 2.28 families to each dwelling, and where only 18.4 per cent, of the families were in undivided occupation of separate dwellings. Islington and Paddington were the only Boroughs with averages of more than 2 families per dwelling. In these two Boroughs, however, houses are larger and the families smaller than in the country generally, the combination of these factors improving their relative positions as expressed by the persons per room ratio. In each Borough without exception the family is smaller than it was ten years ago. As compared with 1911 the density figure with the exception of one Borough shows an improvement, but this applies to the country as a w hole; the change is largely a consequence of the reduction in the size of families and is incomplete as a general index to housing conditions.

Inspector Wilkinson reports that during the year the number of animals slaughtered in the 13 private slaughter-houses within the Borough, including one slaughter-house where horses are slaughtered for export for human consumption, is decreasing annually. The number of visits paid to these during 1931 was 540, and it has been ascertained that 292 oxen, 2 calves, 4,007 sheep and lambs, and 2 pigs were slaughtered; also 2,694 horses for export. No carcase or "part of a carcase" was seized or surrendered on account of disease, and only quite a small number of diseased organs were found. (Vide Table on page 73.) There is a high standard of quality in the animals slaughtered, as has also been shown in previous years. SALE OF FOOD ORDER, 1921. One prosecution was taken for exposing for sale imported meat not properly labelled. The defendant was fined £5 0s. Od. and ordered to pay £3 3s. Od. costs. PUBLIC HEALTH (MEAT) REGULATIONS, 1924. A prosecution was taken for exposing meat for sale from a stall not suitably Covered over and screened at the sides and back, and the defendant was fined £1 1s.

To these 25,095 visits were paid, apportioned as follows : Butchers, Provision Dealers, etc., Shops 8,546 visits Butcher, Provision, etc., Stalls 2,703 Meat, etc., Preparation Factories 141 ,, Fish Shops 1,587 ,, Fish Stalls 1,067 ,, Fruit Shops 2,656 ,, Fruit Stalls 8,395 ,, Total 25,095 „ It is only by regular and constant supervision, considering the large number of street traders and itinerent vendors in the Borough, that the quality and soundness of the food stuffs can be maintained. On a few occasions even with this supervision costermongers have been found exposing for sale bad or doubtful [1931 foods One provision dealer having a stall in the Metropolitan Cattle Market was summoned under the Public Health (Meat) Regulations for undue exposure of his goods to dust and filth. Two summonses were issued for offences at different periods of the same day. Quite evidently the offender, having been caught once, did not expect the Inspector to return shortly afterwards. This shows the need of fairly constant supervision. A tinned food, etc., dealer who had been previously warned against bringing doubtful job stocks to the market not properly sorted to eliminate the unsound tins, was prosecuted and fined £20 and £5 costs for depositing at the Cattle Market unsound tins of fruit. Offensive Trades include 4 tripe dressers, 4 gut scrapers, 4 fur skin dressers, and Knackers' Yard, which received a total of 50 visits. There was no cause for complaint in the conduct of the business carried on in them. Tabulation of meat and organs diseased as found in slaughter-houses during the year 1931:— No. of Cases.

During the year 1,250 samples of foods and drugs, including C15 informal samples, were submitted for analysis by Mr. Green, the Food and Drugs Inspector, who purchased the samples for submission to our Analyst, Dr. Alan W. Stewart. Of the total samples 1,200 were reported to be genuine and 50 adulterated, or 4.0 per cent. This percentage is 0.2 above the previous year, and 3.4 below the average rate during the preceding 10 years. (In addition to this work, the Inspector paid 980 visits to premises, under Merchandise Marks Act.) It is interesting to record that action in two special misdescriptions in which the articles received were not what the public would expect, "Cheese Sandwiches.'' A firm was summoned for having sold " Cheese Sandwiches" which contained 85 per cent, of fat other than milk fat. The Court eventually held that the warranty, although granted through a third party, was good, and a case was taken against the wholesaler as these " cheese sandwiches "had been falsely described, it being actually proved they had been made of margarine "cheese." It transpired at the final hearing of this case that " Biscuit Sandwiches "made entirely with real cheese are not feasible, as they go mouldy in a very short time, and it was pleaded that they were made with margarine in order that they might be kept fit for sale in all parts of the world. The wholesale firm undertook to alter the name of the commodity. Black Currant Pastilles.—A sample of black currant pastilles was bought at a cut price confectionery shop, and on analysis no trace of real black currant was found. It was stated in evidence that people expected to get something at a cut price shop which they would attain elsewhere at a higher price, that was t:> say, that the lowness of the price did not warn people that they might not be getting the genuine article. Expert evidence was given to prove that a black currant pastille was understood in the trade to mean a pastille made with black currant juice. It was stated that it was not known what the flavouring matter in black currant was, and therefore it was not possible to prepare a synthetic essence which was identical with the genuine juice. The Magistrate said he felt obliged to rule that if a person asked for a black currant pastille he expected to get an article which contained some identifiable ingredient which originated from the black currant. During the year 1931 in addition to the samples taken and submitted to the Public Analyst there was a total of 191 informal samples which were examined by the Food and Drugs Inspector. These informal samples comprised a number of varied articles. The greatest amount of detected adulteration occurred in the fourth quarter of the year, as shown by the figures given in the statement below, when it was 5.6 per cent, and contrasted with 4.0, 4.8 and l.G per cent., respectively, in the first, second and third quarters.
