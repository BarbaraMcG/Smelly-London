Edwards ii METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF STEPNEY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, 43, White Horse Road, Stepney, E.l. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, ^ I have the honour to submit to you my Annual Report on the health and sanitary conditions of the Borough of Stepney for the year 1952. The population as estimated by the Registrar-General shows a slight increase, and is now 99,000 compared with the 1951 estimate of 98,850 and the census figure of 98,581. The total number of live births registered was 1,894 and the live birth rate is 19.13. Stepney's infantile mortality rate* has again reached a record low figure of 18.47 which compares favourably with 27.6 for England & Wales. The maternal mortality rate‡ is 3.08, the total number of maternal deaths being six, whilst last year there were no maternal deaths (see page 5). The general death rate for the Borough is 13.8, about the same as last year. The incidence of infectious disease continues to be low with the exception of measles and whooping-cough, of which there were 1,284 and 156 notifications respectively (1,459 and 226 in 1951). * Infant Mortality Rate - the number of deaths per annum of infants under one year of age, per 1000 children born. ‡ Maternal Mortality Rate - the number of deaths per annum of women ascribed to pregnancy, childbearing, abortion, etc., per 1000 live and stillbirths. iii There were no cases of smallpox or typhoid but two paratyphoid cases. No deaths occurred from any infectious disease except one from Infantile paralysis, one from pneumococcal meningitis and two from meningococcal infection. There were 50 deaths from tuberculosis and 241 from cancer. The figures for 1951 wore 49 and 232 respectively. Perhaps the most serious happening this year was the great increase in the number of deaths related to a period of dense smoke-fog which occurred in London between the 5th and 8th December. The first indication of abnormality was the reported deaths of cattle at the Smithfield Show. Later it was assessed that 4,000 human deaths in Greater London could be attributed to the fog. For week ended 13th December the number of deaths recorded in the administrative County of London had been exceeded only four times during the past century. The effect in Stepney was indicated by the following figures: • Deaths in Stepney from bronchitis, pneumonia, influenza, other diseases of the respiratory system and cardiac diseases during the week of the fog and the week after (viz. weeks ended 13th and 20th December) were 115. During the corresponding two weeks in 1951 the figure was 37. Similar weather conditions bringing fog (high barometric pressure, low ground temperature and high relative humidity) may recur, and the obvious danger to health caused by smoke in fog has focussed attention on the need for further measures to achieve smoke abatement in London. Byelaws for the clean handling of food came into force on" 3rd November 1952. These byelaws cover not only shops and cafes but also the sale of food in the open air. In the latter case they are difficult to apply. It is quite Impossible to equip food-barrOws with hot and cold water and proper sanitary conditions and no amount of care can keep dust and flies from food sold under such primitive conditions. With the multiplicity of well-equipped food shops in 1952, barrows and snack shacks would seem unnecessary, but ancient customs die hard. Stepney is a centre of the food trade. Much food is imported and there are important wholesale markets and foodfactories in the Borough. Hie pictures facing page 27 show the Council's food inspectors examining food on the -wharves under the Imported Food Regulations of 1937' and sampling in a food-factory under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. iv The Housing progress of the Borough Council and the London County Council continues apace, and evidence of the progress made will be found on pages 53 and 54. Although certain diseases such as cancer tend to increase there is no doubt that the general health of Stepney has vastly improved during the last half century. The table on page 47 indicates the extent of the. improvement. I would like to express my gratitude to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their support and to the Staff of the Department my appreciation of the interest they have shown in their work throughout the year. I have the honour to be , Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F.

SATISTICS & SOCIAL CONDITION OF THE AREA. General Information. Stepney is situated on the North bank of the Thames, having a river frontage of 2.39 miles. It is roughly rectangular in shape, its length being 2.3 miles and breadth varying from 1 to miles, with 90 miles of streets. The acreage is 1,902 of which the river accounts for 136 acres and the inland Water, consisting of docks and canals, 75 acres. The height above sea level varies from 8ft. at the dockside to 45ft. in the northern part of the Borough. Under the whole of the Borough is the dark blue London clay at a depth of between 20 and 30 feet from the surface. Above this level are layers and patches of gravel and sand, and nearer the surface brown and yellow clays. In some parts of the Borough are layers of „made„ ground, the result of earlier habitation. As is to be expected, the flow of sub-soil water is towards the river. The area is to a large extent industrial in character, factory premises being spread throughout the Borough, but concentrated somewhat towards the western end, apart from the docks and wharves on the river frontage. The chief industries carried on, besides those associated with docks and wharves, are the manufacture of clothing of all kinds, brewing, cigarette making, furniture and upholstery manufacture, and motor vehicle repairs. Open Spaces. The first portion of the King George's Picking Fields was opened during the year by H.R.H.The Duke of Edinburgh. The part opened comprises 10 acres, and the ultimate area is to be 65~2 acres, which will more than double the existing acreage of open spaces in the Borough. A list of open spaces is given on page 43. Population. The Registrar-General's mid-year estimate for 1952 is 99,000, which is 150 more than the mid-year estimate for 1951 ana 419 more than the census figure of that year. The density of population is now 56.05 persons per acre. 3 Births. The total number of live births registered in the Borough during the year was 3,607, of which 1,906 belonged to other areas. „ In addition, 193 births belonging to Stepney occurred outside the Borough, making a total of 1,894 births (1,007 male and 887 females) to Stepney residents. 3,247 births occurred in hospitals in the Borough, of which 1,383 were to Stepney residents. The live birth rate is 19.13 per thousand of the population, the highest since 1948. The rate when adjusted by the comparability factor is 18.55,compared with the County of London rate of 17.6 and the rate for England & Wales of 15.3. Illegitimate live births numbered 166, representing 8.7 per cent of the total live births. Stillbirths numbered 51, representing a rate of 26.2 per 1,000 total births, Comparative vital statistics for the year as between England and Wales, the Administrative County of London, and Stepney, are shown in Table 2 on page 44. Marriages. The number of marriages registered during the year was 907, being 76 more than last year and 149 less than in 1950. The rate of marriages per 1,000 population-wes 18.3 and in 1951 it was 16,8. Deaths, The net number of deaths registered during the year was 1,371, of which 797 were males and 574 females, as compared with 1,364 for last year. The Rate of 13.84 compares with 13.83 for 1951. The principal causes of death were from heart disease, which accounted for 29 per cent of the total deaths, cancer 17 per cent, and diseases of the respiratory system 19 per cent. A Table on page 45 shows deaths by cause and age. Road Accidents. The Table 'on page 46 summarises road accidents vhich have occurred in the Borough over „the past five years, for which information I arc indebted to Mr.A.S.Monckton, the Council's Road Safety Organiser, 4 Infant Mortality. Bie deaths of infants under one year of age numbered 35, giving a rate of 18.47 per thousand live births, the lowest rate ever recorded in Stepney, as compared with 21.12 last year. The rate for England and Wales is 27.6 and that for London 23.8. There were 23 deaths of infants under four weeks old, representing a rate of 12.13 per thousand live births. The main causes of death among infants under one year of age were prematurity and congenital malfoimations. Maternal Mortality. Six maternal deaths occurred during the year, giving a rate of 3.08 per 1,000 total births. Of these 6 deaths, 3 were due to puerperal sepsis and 3 to other causes, including haemorrhage. The three due to puerperal sepsis were: 1. Uraemia due to septic abortion. 2. Multiple pyaemic abscesses due to septic abortion. 3. Intestinal obstruction. Gangrene of small intestine. Septic dissolution of wall of uterus after breech labour. Those due to other causes were: 4. Post partum haemorrhage due to uterine atony. 5. Internal haemorrhage due to ectopic pregnancy. 6. Inhalation of stomach contents during anaesthesia for Caesarean section. Comparative Statistics. A table showing vital statistics for the Borough for various years from 1901 is given on page 47. Unemployment. The Ministry of Labour has kindly supplied me with the following information as to the estimated number of persons residing in the Borough registered as unemployed at the end of the year :- Men Boys Women Girls 2,024 7 234 6 TOTAL 2,271. The total unemployed at the end of 1951 was 2,321. 5 II General Provision Of Health Services WELFARE OF AGED PERSONS. The Council is empowered by Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, as amended by the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, to make application to the Courts for orders for the removal to hospitals or institutions of aged, infirm or physically incapacitated persons who are living in insanitary conditions and who are in need of care and attention. During the year, it was necessary to apply for ten Removal Orders and one Extension Order, details of which are given below. The orders operate for 3 months in each case. In addition to living in Insanitary conditions and being unable to devote to themselves, and not receiving from other persons proper care and attention, the persons removed were also either- * (a) suffering from a grave chronic disease; or (b ) aged and/or infirm, or (c) physically incapacitated. Person. Age * Reason for Action Removed to - Remarks Mrs. M.N. 74 b.c. Institution. Mr.F.P. 82 b.c. Hospital. - Miss B.L. 70 a .b.c. Institution.

Institution. - In addition to the above persons removed under Court Orders, admission was gained to hospitals or institutions for fourteen other persons. The majority of visits to aged persons made by officers of this Department are carried out by the Cornell's woman sanitary inspector and woman hygiene assistant, and over 2,200 visits were made by these officers during the year. 6 Unfortunately there are still far from sufficient voluntary workers to visit aged persons in Stepney, many of whom live alone and have no relatives and who very much appreciate occasional friendly visits. This is social work which is well worth doing, and if any resident of the Borough feels that he or she could help in this respect, the Secretary of the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association, The Royal Foundation of St„Katharine Butcher Row, Ratcliffe, E.14, would appreciate their assistance. A register of old people visited is kept in the Department, a summary of which is as follows:- Number on register at 1st January 237 Additions to the register during the year 370 Removals from register during the year 127 Number on register at 31st December 480 The Council provides a service for disinfesting and Cleansing bed linen and personal clothing, under Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. This service although not provided solely for old folk affords most benefit to such people. Aged persons »ho have not the facilities in their homes for a bath, or vho are not capable of bathing themselves, are assisted in this respect by the Department's cleansing attendants with the aid of portable bath equipment. By this means during the year 122 old persons were bathed and 263 baths given. There are fourteen old people's clubs in the Borough, whose activities are co-ordinated by the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association. The Council is represented on this body by members of the Council and the Medical Officer of Health, and applications to the Council by old persons' clubs for grants under Section 31 of the National Assistance Act, 1948. are referred to the Association for investigation. Grants made to clubs by the Council during the year amounted to £1,844. A Meals on Wheels service is provided for the old folk, run jointly by the Old People's Welfare Association and the W.V.S., some 13>000 meals being delivered during the year, and four of the clubs have Luncheon Clubs which.provided over 15,000 meals in 1952. Chiropody Clinics are provided at five of the clubs. 7 DECEASED PERSONS. Mortuary. Ten bodies were received in the Council's Mortuary during the year. Inquests. Inquests were held on 49 residents of the Borough, 3 of whom were children under five years of age: 9 deaths were due to suicide, 22 were accidental, and 18 due to other causes (2 natural causes, 10 misadventure, 2 open verdict, 1 manslaughter and 3 murder). Burials. Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, placed a duty on the Council to arrange for the burial of any persons found dead within the borough, where no private arrangements have been made. Twenty-six such burials took place during the year at a cost of £240. Of this amount £160 was recovered from the estates of the deceased persons, leaving £80 falling to the cost of the Council. FREE WASHING FACILITIES. The public availed themselves in increasing numbers of the Council's provision for free washing facilities in public conveniences, some 40,000 free washes being taken during the year. This service was established last year to promote food and personal hygiene and cleanliness. HOSPITAL FACILITIES. The undermentioned hospitals are situated in Borough: the No. of Beds The London Hospital, Whitechapel Road 689 Mile End Hospital, Bancroft Road 475 St.George-in-the-East Hospital, Raine Street 215 The London Jewish Hospital, Stepney Green 125 Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children, Glamis Road 50 East End Maternity Hospital, Commercial Road 60 8 LEGISLATION.

Die -work of the Information Service, situated at 6?la Commercial Road, E.14, has been well -maintain ed throughout the past year and the total number of enquiries dealt with during the period shows a slight incease over the preceding twelve months, A total of 12,641 enquiries were received from personal callers, by telephone and letters, this number being an increase of 345 over the previous year. The value of the Service to the residents of Stepney has once again been demonstrated by the number of calls made upon the Sorvice and. It has bocono the usud thins to „take your problem, ot dircct your enquiry to the Information Centre„. The enquiries received can be broadly classified under two which In headings - (a) General and Local Information and (b) Personal Problems. Thn lattor covers numerous matters and it is the attention given to these which forms the most socially important activity of the Information Service. The enquiries themselves have remained as varied as ever although those on Local and Civic information again head the list, closely followed by enquiries arising out of Landlord and Tenant and Marital problems. The greatest care is taken at the Centre to provide the highest possible standard of accuracy in all answers given and to ensure that people with problems to solve, some of them of an embarrassing kind, are dealt with sympathetically and tactfully. The fact that so many who have used the Service on a previous occasion return for advice on other matters is perhaps the surest measure of the success which the Information Service enjoys and is also a matter of great satisfaction to the staff. I am indebted for this information to the Information Officer, Mr, J, Mordsley, -who administers the Service under the direction of the Borough Librarian. 14 SWIMMING AND SLIPPER BATHS. The three swimming baths in the Borough are Council Baths. During the year the number of swims amounted to 100,948 comprising 23,417 adults and 77,531 children. The water is subjected to continuous chlorination and filtration and samples are taken periodically for analysis. The number of slipper baths taken during the year, at the four Council establishments, was 344,179 which included 5,392 attendances of Old Age Pensioners who were admitted free of charge. HEALTH PROPAGANDA. Distribution of leaflets and display of posters on various health subjects was carried out in the Borough during the year. A Diphtheria Immunisation Campaign was carried out in accordance with the request of the Ministry of Health. Combined advertisements giving particulars of facilities for immunisation appeared in the local press during March, April and May. At five local cinemas, slides were shown for periods of one week at intervals during the campaign. Five-thousand leaflets and 100 posters were distributed through Schools, Day Nurseries, Infant Welfare Centres, the W.V.S., Gas and ELectricity Showrooms, Libraries, Factories, Public Conveniences, Public Baths and Hospitals etc In addition with the co-operation of the Borough Librarian 500 book-marks were distributed with library books. 1,200 leaflets „The Customer's Health is in Your Hands„ and „A Message to Housewives„ were distributed through the usual channels, a large quantity also being distributed through Youth Clubs. Six-thousand leaflets on various Health Education subjects including Diphtheria Immunisation, Measles, Whooping Cough, Vaccination, Tuberculosis, Bugs, Food Hygiene etc., were distributed from the exhibition stand at Mile End Library. The main topics of this exhibition stand dealt with Food Hygiene, the Work of the Sanitary Inspector, and Burning and Scalding Accidents in the Home. 15 Notices on the Council's bye-law regarding depositing of rubbish wore posted in various blocks of tenements and on many vacant sites where nuisances had arisen. „The Public Health Service as a Career„ was the feature of a stand exhibited by the Department during the exhibition on „Careers for School Leavers„ which was organised in the Borough by the local Rotary Club, with the co-operation of the L.C.C, and local Borough Councils. This Public Health stall was staffed by members of the Department and much interest was shown by the children of school leaving age who visited it. STAFF CHANGES.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES Most of the work of the District Sanitary Inspectors has been concerned with sanitary defects in dwelling houses. Summaries of inspections and sanitary work effected during the year are given on Pages 48 and 49. Complaints. 5,029 complaints were recorded in the register, but in addition numerous complaints were made direct to the district sanitary inspectors.

Further Housing Statistics are given on pages 55 and 56. Among the interesting statistics recorded in the Registrar-General's One Per Cent Sample Tables of the 1951 Census, are those relating to the presence or absence of ordinary amenities in the housing of Great Britain to-day. It transpires that 24 per cent of the households in the Greater London area have to share water closet accommodation (23% in Great Britain). 22 per cent in the London area have to share piped water supply (17% in Great Britain). Households in the Greater London area which have no bath of their own, or who have to share baths amount to 46 per cent (45% in Great Britain). Bad as these figures may appear they are a great improvement on the situation 50 years ago. 25 V. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISE ON OF FOOD Since June, 1949, when the Mills (Special Designations) Regulations 1949 came into operation, there has been a steady improvement in the method of distribution of milk, and in all shops milk is now sold in closed bottles and cartons prepacked by the large wholesalers. This has, to a large extent, removed the probability of contamination and adulteration in the shops. There has since 1949 been an increase of approximately 11 per cent in the number of premises where milk is sold. Towards the end of the year, the London County Council Byelaws for the Protection of Food became operative. These byelaws which contain provisions for the better handling, wrapping and delivery of food are an advance on previous legislation and should bring about a general improvement in the standard of. food hygiene. At the beginning of the century there were 93, basement bakehouses in Stepney, only 69 of which were granted certificates of suitability under the Factory & Workshops Act of 1901. At the. commencement of the operation of the Factories Act, 1937, there were still 33 basement bakehouses in the Borough. By 1946 this number had been reduced to .20, partly by bombing and other disturbances during the war. In 1949, action, deferred during the war, was taken under section 54 of the Factories Act 1937 to close 11 of the remaining basement bakehouses. These were given 3 years notice to close by May 1952. Before the and of the year all eleven basement bakehouses were successfully closed and only nine of the original 93 now remain. The closing of basement bakehouses is in the interest both of the bakehouse staff and the customer, and under the Act of 1937 all new bakehouses must be at or above ground floor level. The Borough Council's authority to operate the Food and Drugs Act covers also that portion of the Borough which is within the confines of the Port Health Authority. The duties include the supervision of the many dock canteens of the Port of London Authority. 26 During the. year the Borough Council successfully opposed a representation to the Ministry of Food by the Port Health Authority to have these and other Food and Drugs Act powers transferred to the latter authority. The canteens are largely patronised by dockers who are resident in Stepney and the Borough Council considered that continued supervision by the Council's Food Inspectors would be most adequate and appropriate. Milk Supply. There are 265 distributors in the Borough, including 21 with dairies and 30 itinerants. During the year 264 inspections were made and 13 Notices served. Fourteen samples of milk, 10 for chemical and 4 for bacteriological examination were taken in the course of delivery to hospitals and schools in the Borough. All the samples were satisfactory. Milk (Special Designations ) (Pasteurised & Sterilised Milk) & (Raw Milk) Regulations. 1949. 463 licences were. issued during the year, including 189 for "Pasteurised" milk, 217 for "Sterilised" milk, 56 for "Tuberculin Tested" milk and one Pasteuriser's licence.

Dysentery. 73 notifications were received during the year as compared with 222 the previous year. The diagnosis was not confirmed in two of the notifications. Food Poisoning. Fourteen individual cases of suspected food poisoning were notified. In 8 cases a salmonella organism was isolated from the patients' stools and in no case was the source of infection traced to any particular article of food. In addition to the notified cases mentioned above, information reached the Department of an outbreak of food poisoning in an industrial canteen situated in the Borough. On 3rd January, 1952, a number of employees of a business establishment suffered from vomiting and diarrhoea after a meal at 1 p.m. the previous day in the firm's canteen. Investigation of the canteen was carried out the same day, and the following information was obtained. The meal consisted of beef sausages purchased on 1st January 32 from a grocery store In the neighbourhood, and cooked in fat in the oven, These were served as sandwiches in bread rolls. About 15 employees partook of the meal, and 6 or 7 felt ill about 9 p.m. and later. Other foods eaten were tomato soup, blue vein cheese, cream cakes, bread and butter, tea or coffee. Some had their own sandwiches, and 4 of these were also taken ill. Jan.l. Cook vomited in morning. Served above type of lunch and went home at 2.30 p.m. Jan.2. Same type of meal eaten by employees, 1 p.m. Several ill, 9 p.m. Jan.3. Similar meal eaten. No ill effects. On 3rd January, the day of investigation, no samples remained of the sausages eaten on the 2nd, but samples were taken of those eaten on the 3rd, and of the fat in which they were cooked. Samples were also taken of synthetic cream cakes. On 4th January the cook was interviewed. She had quite recovered, and had not seen her doctor. No evidence was seen of septic sores. On 7th January all the affected staff had recovered from their illness. Bacteriological Reports. Sausages - no food poisoning or pathogenic germs. Unused Cooking Fat - light growth of staphylococcus albus. Used Cooking Fat - mixed growth of staphylococcus aureus (coagulese negative) and B.Subtilis present. Synthetic Cream - culture negative. From the above bacteriological report it is possible that the used fat was the cause of the outbreak. Measles. Notifications for the year numbered 1,284, and there were no deaths. There were 1,459 cases in 1951. One measles epidemic reached its peak in March 1951 and the 33. next in December 1952, which follows the expected incidence.

No cases of smallpox were notified during the year and it was not necessary for me to take action under the Public Health (Smallpox) Regulations, 1917. The number of children successfully vaccinated or revaccinated at L.C.C. clinics during the year was 656. A supply of vaccine is kept in the Department for emergency use. Tuberculosis. The number of primary notifications of pulmonary tuberculosis received was 137 as compared with 173 last year, and the number of non-pulmonary cases was 12 as compared with 16 in 1951. The mortality rate for the year of pulmonary tuberculosis is 49 and of non-pulmonary 1 per 100,000 population, as compared with 46 and 3 respectively in 1951. (See details of register on p.59 ). The Tuberculosis Regulations, 1952, which revoked the 1930 Regulations, came into operation on 1st May and modified the 1930 Regulations to bring them into line with the requirements of the National Health Services. Public Health (Prevention of Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1925. These regulations provide that persons suffering from tuberculosis of the respiratory tract shall not be employed in the handling of milk or milk receptacles. Power is given to the Council to cause such persons to discontinue their employment. It was not found necessary to take action under the regulations during the year. Tuberculosis Care Committee. The Tuberculosis Care Committee on which are represented voluntary and official bodies, and whose meetings are attended by the Medical Officer of Health, continues to supply help to tuberculous persons and their relatives who require assistance which cannot be obtained from official sources, or where urgency or special circumstances indicate that the voluntary sources of the Care Committee are preferable. 35 Help was given during the year to 84 persons by way of clothing, extra nourishment, provision of convalescence and holiday expenses, beds, bedding, rent, insurance, coal, wireless licences, and home helps. The annual Christmas Seal Sale Fund amounted to £295. Whooping Cough. 156 cases were notified during the year, the figure for 1951 being 226. There were no deaths from the disease. Infectious Disease Contacts. Where a person is precluded from continuing at work by reason of being a carrier, or having been in contact with infectious disease, benefits under the National Insurance Act, 1946, are only paid on production of a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health. It was not found necessary to issue any such certificate during the year. Authentication of International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation. A person proceeding abroad is required in certain countries to produce a certificate of recent successful vaccination and inoculation. The medical signatures of 202 such certificates were authenticated by me during the year. Disinfection. 448 premises were disinfected because of infectious disease, of which 17 were for pulmonary tuberculosis. 110,335 articles of clothing and bedding were steam disinfected, including 90,650 articles for export for which 223 certificates were issued. Formaldehyde disinfection of 253,029 articles of clothing for export was also carried out during the year, for which 191 certificates were issued. Charges for the export disinfecting -service amounted to £726. Disinfestation. (Bod bugs and other insect pests). The following is a summary of work carried out by the specialist inspectors 36 General inspections for vermin 1,519 Attempted visits 443 No. of premises found verminous 431 No. of re-visits 405 No. of miscellaneous visits 698 No. of premises sprayed 872 No. of rooms sprayed 1,759 + (+) Including 329 rooms dealt with at the request of Sanitary Inspectors. As a precautionary measure the furniture and effects of all families transferred to Borough Council dwellings are treated, prior to removal, with hydrogen cyanide at the Council's Disinfestation Station, 42 Narrow Street. The furniture and effects of 262 such families were treated during the year. In addition, disinfestation by steam and formaldehyde was carried out on twenty-two occasions during the year of the furniture and effects of families rehoused by the London County Council. Many treatments were also carried out for infestations of cockroaches, beetles, ants, silverfish and the like. Charges for miscellaneous disinfestations carried out during the year amounted to £186. The specialist inspector is unable in many cases to gain entry during normal hours into dwellings for the purpose of inspection, because so many wives of tenants are out at work. Accordingly arrangements are made for evening inspections, when the occupants of the dwellings return home from work. 38 such inspections were carried out during the year. Verminous Persons. The number of lice infested persons bathed and whose clothing was disinfested at Branch Road Cleansing Station was as follows:- Males Females Children 421 48 18 = Total 487. The number of baths and treatments given amounted to 536. 37 Summary of Borough Analyst's Quarterly Reports for the year 1952. During the year, 1,173 samples were submitted for analysis.
