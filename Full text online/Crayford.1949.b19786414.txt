To the Chairman and Members of the Urban Distiict Council and Health Committee. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1949. As a result of the transfer of the Part III services under the National Health Service Act 1946, to the Kent County Council and the consequent reduction in the field of health administration under the jurisdiction of the County District Authorities, the Urban District of Crayford and the Boroughs of Bexley and Erith decided to appoint a joint Medical Officer of Health as from the 1st April, 1949. Arrangements were also made with the Borough of Bexley for the joint use of the Cleansing and Disinfection Station maintained by the latter. A comprehensive Clean Food Campaign was also embarked upon jointly with the Boroughs of Bexley and Erith, not only because a joint Medical Officer of Health facilitated such an arrangement but because it was felt that the nature of the area was such that the problem transcended mere considerations of geographical boundaries. The Campaign includes the setting up of a Food Traders Guild, the formulation of Codes of Practice and the adoption of a wide programme of Health Education, included an Exhibition, public lectures, film shows, and talks to food handlers at their places., of Work. In accordance with the decision of the Housing Committee to give all possible priority to families in which there was a case or cas|es of tuberculosis, a number of recommendations were made and a number of such families have been rehoused. 2 The number of new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis notified during the year, 1949, is, 46 as compared with 31 in 1948, and the Death Rate increased from 0.29 per 1,000 of the population in 1948 to 0.62 per 1,000 in 1949. I have no doubt that this increase is directly related to the inadequacy of hospital accommodation foi chronic cases and the inability to provide for early admission to hospital of newly discovered cases. No improvement can be expected until proper isolation (inter alia) can be provided for all open cases, especially where there are small children and overcrowding is rife. The tendency of acute anterior poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis) to assume epidemic form in the Country is a disturbing feature of present day public health administration and it is recorded that six cases occurred in Crayford during 1949 ; happily however, there were no deaths. One case only of diphtheria was notified during the year, which is a matter for satisfaction when one bears in mind the severe epidemics of not so many years ago. During the year, following a report to the Council that the result of bacteriological examinations of swimming bath water at their Martens Grove Pool wore generally speaking unsatisfactory, action was taken to review the existing arrangements for sterilization. It was found that although the existing ozonization plant was adequate for a normal use of the swimming pool it became to some extent, ineffective when its use was greatly extended as it was during the hot summer months. It was accordingly decided to instal break-point chlorination as well and results) have since been eminently satisfactory. The care of old people has exercised the Health Department considerably during the year. Although no statutory action had to be taken under section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1946, many cases occurred of old people who depended for the necessities of life on the good will of neighbours and friends. Some of these old people urgently required removal to hospital and, as is 4 well known, there is a shortage of beds or, more accurately, of nursing staff for this purpose. The Woolwich Group Hospital Management Committee has been very co-operative, however, and it has been possible to help a number of old people whose circumstances had become very serious. The Vital Statistics for the year were again satisfactory, although the Birth Rate fell slightly from 18.4 in 1948 to 17.9 in 1949, and the Death Rate increased from 7.5 to 8.03. The Infantile Mortality Rate increased from l9.9 per 1,000 live births in 1948 to 26.4 per 1,000 in 1949) but this rate is Still well below that for England and Wales as a whole. Generally speaking the health of the district has been well maintained. The occurrence of such incidents as the outbreak of Smallpox in the S.S. "Mooltan" 'is a proof that even to-day the price of safety is eternal vigilance. My thanks are due to the Council for their help and encouragement at all times and to the Senior Sanitary Inspector and all members of the staff for their devoted service on all occasions. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JOHN LANDON, Medical Officer of Health. 5 STATISTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA.

On a recommendation from the Health Committee that special consideration be given to cases but forward by the Medical Officer of Health involving Tuberculosis in the applicants' family, the Council agreed to consider such cases outside the normal points scheme. Venereal Disease Clinic. This was held at the County Hospital, West Hill, Dartford. PUBLIC CLEANSING. During the year the Council entered into a new agreement with the Borough of Bexley for the joint use of their Cleansing Station, and the existing wartime arrangement ceased from the date on which the new arrangement took effect. Facilities were available for the disinfection of bedding following cases of Tuberculosis and Cancer, and for the disinfestation of bedding of verminous persons and those who had had scabies. 18 INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD. Food. The following samples of food were submitted for examination and analysis during the year :— New Zealand Spray Process Milk Powder—reported to contain 2.4 acidity as Lactic Acid: The acidity was too high and on this account likely to have been unsatisfactory in use. Complaint was received regarding gravy cubes. The Analyst reported that they contained small white living maggots and were unfit for food. The stock was eventually withdrawn from sale. One sample of powdered potato was submitted for analysis. The packet Was old and discoloured, stained on the base and appeared to have been wet and dried out. The contents had a yellowish colour and' although the contents of the packet could not be condemned, it was obviously from very old stock. One sample of a preparation sold as salad cream was found to be unfit for food. The product was not a salad cream and should not have been so labelled. The oil in the preparation was rancid and the acid from the vinegar had acted upon the metal cover o;f the jar. All the stock in the district was surrendered. One sample of Macaroni with Tomato Sauce was found to be free from poisonous metal^. Complaint was received that a cake containing cake and bun mixture had an unpleasant taste. The Analyst suggested that insufficient flour had been added thus giving too high a proportion of the cake and bun mixture which was equivalent to the use of a large excess of baking powder and as a consequence caused high alkalinity and nauseating taste. One sample of Sandwich Spread was found to be free from arsenic and injurious metals and their compounds, and fit for food. 19 Meat. A specimen from chump end of loin of lamb submitted for confirmation of diagnosis proved Caseous Lymphadenitis. Poplit eal and Prescapular glands from two English beasts also forwarded for confirmation of diagnosis—were reported to be affected by Tuberculosis. Complaint was received that a joint of meat appeared to be horse-flesh. The Analyst's report showed no evidence of horse-flesh. Milk. Licences granted by the Council under the Milk (Special Designation) Order, 1936, are as follows :— Principal Licences.:— Pasteurised milk 4. Supplementary Licences :— Pasteurised milk 6. Tuberculin tested milk 6. In accordance with the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, which came into force on the 1st October, 1949, the following Licences were issued by the Council: Supplementary Licences :— Pasteurised milk 1. Sterilized milk 6. 'Dealers Licences :— Sterilized milk 6. Meat and Other Foods.

SECTION 17, FOOD & DRUGS ACT, 1938. NOTIFICATION OF FOOD POISONING. It came to our notice that cases of suspected food poisoning had occurred over a wide area including the Urban District of Crayford as a result of eating shell fish particularly cockles, obtained at resortsl on the Thames Estuary. Steps were taken to warn the public and posters to that effect were widely displayed in the district.

Water. The Metropolitan Water Board is the supplying authority. The supply to the Crayford District isk a mixture of water from Crayford, Dartford, Darenth, Wansunt and Wilmington wells. All the water was chlorinated on the works, but any chlorine remaining after a period of contact was removed completely. Bacteriological analyses were made five times, per week for all supplies both before and after chlorination and 10U per cent, first class, results were obtained during the year. All new and repaired mains were chlorinated before being restored to use and samples of water from them were tested bacteriologically. None of the supplies was plumbo-solvent. All the houses in the district except one were suppled direct from the mains. There have been no new extensions during 1949. Water Sampling. (a) Wells (drinking water) Bacteriological 4. Shallow well (Industrial suppUy only) Bacteriological 2 ; Chemical 1. (b) New Pipe Sup-ply, Bacteriological 2. (c) Swimming Pool, Bacteriological 74. As a result of the high bacterial count reported by the Analyst on samples taken from the Swimming Pool, a period of testing daily was adopted with a view to ascertaining the best methods of procurring a rereduction in the bacterial count. 24 Following the scries of samples taken, a breakpoint chlorinator plant was installed, and it is hoped that during the coming season better results will bo obtained. Drainage and Sewerage. A small foul sewer 63 yards was laid to obviate the use of a cesspool.
