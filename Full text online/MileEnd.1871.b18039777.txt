Dated this 24th day of May, 1871. JOHN HAIGH, REGINALD MILLS, HENRY MORRISON, WALTER CLARKE, REPORT OF THE SURVEYOR TO THE VESTRY OF THE Hamlet of mile end old town REPORT. JUNE, 1871. Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in laying before you a short summary of the work performed under my supervision during the year ending March 25th, 1871. Carriageway Paving. During the year the first portion of the Mile End Road has been paved. The Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London having for sale a quantity of 3-in. by 9-in. pitching, which they had taken up from Cheapside, the Vestry purchased it at 13s 6d per ton. The following extract from my report to the Highway Committee, upon the subject, will show how advantageous this purchase has been to the Vestry. "The cost of stone £599 6 6 Cartage of same from City Wharf 109 12 6 Labour for laying 203 9 0 Total cost £912 8 0 The area covered is 2060 superficial yards, and the cost therefore 8s 10¼d per yard. The expense of new stone, of the same size, would have been 15s 6d per yard superficial, and would therefore have cost £1596 10s. There has consequently been a saving of £684 2s." The old pitching removed from the 9-feet ways, at the western portion of the road, has been re-dressed and re-laid at the eastern end ; the space covered was 1100 yards superficial, and the cost 3s. per yard. The loss in area, consequent upon re-dressing, was 39 per cent. Much attention has been given by the Paving Committee to the question of paving the whole of the Mile End Road ; and it may not be uninteresting to examine the following table of the cost of performing this work with various sizes of stone applicable for the purpose. Aberdeen Granite. Cost of paving the space between the Tramway Company's work and the kreb. The iike, but using the present old stone, re-dressed and re-land. 4-ins. x 9-ins. £18,596 £9,613 4-ins. x 7. ins. £11,969 £8,785 3-ins, x 9ins. £14,534 £10,206 New Lines of Railways and Tramways. Two Bills for Railways affecting the Hamlet have 1 before Parliament during the session : Ist, the Eastern Metropolitan Railway Bill; and, 2nd, the East London Railway Bill. The Eastern Metropolitan Railway was to start from Meeting-house Yard, Aldgate, and enter the Whitechapel Road with a curve, then traverse Whitechapel Road, Whitechapel High Street, Mile End Road and Row Road, until it reached the North London Railway, at Bow. This Dill was however abandoned. By the East London Railway Bill power was asked to abandon the up-junction with and all lines north of the Great Eastern Railway, which were sanctioned by the Act of 1865, also to authorize an alteration in the levels sanctioned by such Act, between the point where the Railway is authorized to be constructed under the main line of the Great Eastern Railway, and the point where the intended Railway will join the portion already constructed a! Wapping. The object of this alteration is to run on to the Great Eastern Railway, at Mape Street, instead of running under that Railway, as proposed by the Act of 1865. The proposed Railway enters our parish at a depth of 50 ft. and leaves it at 37 ft. 6 in. below the ground. The houses scheduled under the previous Act are again scheduled, and embrace 122 different properties. Tramways. By three different bills powers were sought to lay tramways affecting this District: — The North-Eastern Metropolitan Tramways Bill; The Commercial Road East Tramways Bill; and The North Metropolitan Tramways Bill. The two first bills were thrown out by the Committee of the House of Commons, and the North Metropolitan Tramways Bill is still pending in Parliament. There are four lines of tramways proposed in this lastmentioned Bill, which will affect this Hamlet, viz., the Commercial Road line, the Cambridge-heath Road line, the Burdett Road line, and the Grove Road line. Unpaved Carriageways. The following is a list of the principal unpaved carriageways in the Hamlet, and shews the amount of material used in each for repairs during the year :— Gravel Granite Gravel Granite 1 Lincoln-street Albert-street 4 10 Arbour-street, E. 31 Lincoln-street 34 Alfred-street 18 5 Montague-street . 6 2 Burdett-road 26 26 Morgan-street. 9 2 Bow Common-lane 1 127 Mile End-road 4 644 Bedford-square 22 Nicholas-street 6 Bedford-street 29 Nelson-street 59 9 Bancroft-road 2 18 New-street 42 Bridge-street, E 70 1 Norfolk-street 3 60 Beaumont-square 10 New York-street 6 Bromehead-street 52 Oxford-street 6 22 Canal-road 27 26 Old Church-road 5 Charles-street 27 23 Philpot-street 11 Coborn-road 10 Paterson-street 10 Carlton-road 25 Regent's-road 130 Carr-street 18 Rhodeswell-road . 12 Copley-street 13 Rutland-street 95 6 Regent-street 2 Colmar-street 38 Devonshire-street. 16 91 Redman's-row 4 10 Ernest-street 2 Russell-street 6 1 Epping-place 2 Richardson-street 4 Edward- street 5 21 Railway-place 6 Frederick-place 5 St. Peter's-road 36 7 Frimley-st. & place 2 South-grove 65 Grove-street 13 2 Stepney-green 10 204 Gloucester-street 15 Sidney-street 5 Globe-road 34 7 St. Paul's-road 2 15 Grafton-street 2 Smith-street 8 Grove-road 2 21 Suffolk-street 56 Gainsborough- road 3 Sidney-square 5 5 St. Dunstan's-road 38 Greenfield-street.. 2 Tredegar-square 43 Greenwood-street.

During the year 10,000 superficial feet of new 2£- inch paving have been used in repairing the present footways of the Hamlet. Scavenging. During the year the Great Eastern Railway Company have received nearly all the sweepings from the roads, and removed them by rail to counties where such material is valuable as manure. The cost of cartage has been . £1087 15 0 That of loading into carts . . 261 8 2 That of loading into the Com . pany's trucks 108 14 0 The quantity removed from the roads during the year has been 10,439 cubic yards. Watering. During the year, the water-carts have been employed on 121 days, at a cost of £582 6s 3d for horses and drivers, and of £415 17s Od for 10,250,000 gallons of water supplied by the East London Water Works Company. The following Table will shew the cost of Horse Hire and Labour during the past four years: — HORSE HIRE AND LABOUR. 1869. 1870. 1868. 1871. £ d. £ d. £ d. £ d. s. s. s. s.

The lighting of the Hamlet is performed by the Commercial Gas Company, who light 771 lamps. The cost during the year has been £3349 4s 5d. There has been no complaint during the year of the amount of supply to private consumers, or the quality of the gas. From Midsummer-day the rate of gas to private consumers will be reduced from 4s to 3s 9d per 1000 cubic feet. Sewers. For some time past the old sewer in the footway of the Mile End Road, on the north side, has been an annoyance to the inhabitants near thereto; and, in consequence of its having given way in several places, the length from Bancroft Road to Globe Road has been abolished. The Cost of this work, the importance of which cannot be over-rated, is £160 6s. 110½d There is still a considerable portion to be demolished, the cost of which I estimate at £000; and so soon as the Vestry's funds will permit, I strongly recommend that the work be completed. New sewers have been laid down in Regent's Road, John's Place, Robert Street, Turner's Road, and Bow Common Lane, the cost of which has been £1066 19s. 2d. The following Table will shew the length of each description of sewer and drain constructed in the Hamlet during the year. SIZE OF SEWER.

REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION & PUBLIC HEALTH OF Mile en d old town, For the YEAR ENDING MARCH, 1871- BY MATTHEW CORNER, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: Printed by THOS. PENNY & Co., LEMAN STREET, WHITECIHAPEL, 1871. REPORT. Gentlemen, I have to submit the Fifteenth Annual Report upon the Public Health in the Hamlet for the year ending March 25th, 1871, as required by the Metropolis Local Government Act. I have in the first place to explain the reason for the late appearance of this report ; and this is the more necessary because the delay has probably retarded the delivery of the combined reports of my colleagues and myself. At the period when my Annual Report is usually presented there was a considerable accession of work caused by the presence of the small-pox epidemic, and before this had subsided the rumours of the approach of cholera still further added to this work, and thus I was prevented from proceeding with my report at the usual period. Ido not regret this as I believe much benefit has accrued therefrom; still I have thought it my duty to make this explanation to the Vestry. If the number of births and deaths proportionate to population may be taken —the former as an indication of material prosperity and the latter of good health, we may feel assured that both these satisfactory conditions, in spite of an exceptional epidemic, have prevailed among the inhabitants, and that this Hamlet maintains its reputation for salubrity. The number of births for the year was 3724 or about 40.7 to every 1000 of the present population ; the corresponding rate for the whole Metropolis was 35 per 1000 population. The births exceeded the average for the previous five years by 333. Mile End has generally maintained an exceptionally high birth-rate. If we estimate the average population during the previous five years at 85,000, the average number of births during that period being 3461, would still show a birth-rate of over 40 per 1000 population. The total deaths] for the year were 2000, against 2346 for the previous year, the average for five years, was 2096, although occurring in a less population. The annual death-rate in the Hamlet was 21.5 per 1000 population living, that for the whole Metropolis was 24 per 1000 population. Had the same rate of mortality prevailed in Mile End as in the whole Metropolis, the deaths in Mile End would have been 235 more than the present return, or .25 per cent, upon the population. Zymotic Diseases. It is this class of diseases which affords the best evidence of the value and results of sanitary measures upon the public health. The total number of deaths from all diseases in this class, during the twelve months, was 424 against 702 in the previous year, and 458 the average of five previous years. By the same Table, it will be seen that of the four principal diseases in this class, there were 236 fatal cases during the year, whereas in the previous year there were 400, and the average for the five previous years was 250, and for ten previous years 251: thus, commencing from a period when the population of the Hamlet was 20,000 less than at present, we have, with a much larger population, during the last five years, had a less number of deaths from these four principal epidemic diseases than in the previous five years of the decennial period, the aggregate for each quinquennial period being 1264 and 1251 respectively; taking into consideration that the population would increase in a progressively increasing ratio each successive year, and estimating the increase of population during the two five yearly periods at 8,000 and 12,000 respectively, and the average population during each such period at 78,000 and 88,000, the deaths from these four diseases would be in the proportion of 16 per 1000 population during the former and 14 during the latter five years. It is true that these diseases showed an excessive mortality in the year 1869-70, but this result was almost entirely attributable to the scarlet fever epidemic, a disease which once originated, might spread unlimitedly among a population possessing the best sanitary conditions, unless arrested by the most rigid measures. I attribute the satisfactory results, as stated above, to the constant and effective promotion of sanitary work in this Hamlet, the disregard and neglect of which, in former times, has entailed upon us exceptional disease and death. The opinion is entertained, and has been recently proclaimed, by some authorities, that these infectious diseases come and go, are intensified and modified, rise and fall, in obedience to some natural and unalterable laws, and that, therefore, their permanent presence, in varying degrees, is inevitable. From this doctrine I entirely dissent, and its reception, as even being possible or probable, would have a most prejudicial effect upon sanitary progress in relation to the public health. I can here only repeat what I have over and over again stated, upon former occasions, that nothing can be more clearly attributable to material cause and effect than these epidemic diseases, and that they are, therefore, amenable to, and under the control of, human powers. Upon this subject I will only further state that, when some years since I reported to you my conviction in the existence of innumerable old and forgotten drains and cesspools (not only in this Hamlet but universally), impregnating earth and air with poisonous gases therefrom, I did so in the belief that they were, by their contents, the absolute causes of the generic origin of most of these diseases, and my subsequent experience has completely confirmed this opinion; it is, therefore, a matter of great satisfaction to me that you have caused, and are still causing, although at considerable temporary cost, the discovery and abolition of these foci of disease, and to which your Surveyor will doubtless refer in his Report, as they have been mostly brought under your notice through his department. I trust that similar means are being, or will be, adopted in other Districts for this and other practical work of a like kind, combined with measures for the prevention of spreading, such as isolation of patients, disinfection of infected bedding and clothing, inspection of schools, &c., are the practical means, if effectually carried out, whereby alone an immediate and decided effect can be produced, towards suppressing these diseases, otherwise in defiance of all sanitary laws enacted and to be enacted, and by which great improvements in the direction of the public health will be doubtless effected, we shall still be continually surprised and puzzled by the spontaneous outbreak of such diseases as scarlet fever, and, probnbly, where cause for its origin was least suspected. The kind of work which I have indicated has been, as far as possible, carried out in this District during the twelve months, and it is to its effects we may fairly attribute the diminished mortality from these diseases. There are many other diseases not usually recognised as belonging to the zymotic class, but which I have no doubt whatever have their origin in a similar manner, and are often modifications of the more positive diseases in this class. Of these, are many pulmonary affections usually ascribed to inflammation, the result of cold, rheumatic fever, strumous diseases, and probably consumption itself; many others of a more or less formidable character might be included as having their probable cause in specific blood poisoning, leaving comparatively few diseases which may not be included in this class, and therefore amenable to human control and prevention; but this is a subject which cannot be pursued within the limits of a Report. Smalt, Pox and Scarlet Fever. The Table subjoined contains a return of the number of deaths from small pox and scarlet fever in Mile End Old Town and the whole Metropolis, separately, during seven quarters ending September, 1871. The interesting feature of this return is the alternation in the severity of the two diseases, as indicated by the number of deaths in each quarter. Thus, in the first quarter of 1870, the small pox epidemic may be said to have first definitively asserted itself, although it did not begin to assume very large proportions until the last quarter of 1870. It was in this quarter also that the scarlet fever epidemic of 1869-70, attained its maximum of severity. By the Table, it will be seen that both in the whole Metropolis and in this Hamlet small pox caused the fewest number of deaths in the first or October month of that quarter, and scarlet fever the greatest number of deaths during precisely the same period. During the second month of the quarter (November) there was conversely an increase in the number of deaths from small pox, and an equivalent decrease in the number of deaths from scarlet 3 22 284 March 8 Total 1st Quarter. 15 42 91 1218 April 3 2 31 364 May 2 4 45 321 June 1 6 38 389 Total 2nd Quarter. 1074 6 12 114 July 2 6 62 499 5 47 466 August 2 47 September 10 24 618 Total 3rd Quarter. 14 35 156 1583 7 91 920 23 October 14 11 149 November 608 December. 1871. 18 3 357 595 Total 4th Quarter 37 39 597 2122 13 January 9 555 322 February 10 4 852 190 March 9 176 2 797 Total 1st Quarter. 32 688 15 2204 5 April 19 26 18 1208 166 0 1044 120 May 6 946 100 June Total 2nd Quarter. 63 11 3198 386 789 July 123 26 0 August 11 0 345 99 September 8 0 356 145 Total 3rd Quarter. 45 0 1490 367 fever; the same relative mortality is observed in the third month (December) of the quarter. During this quarter scarlet fever attained its maximum of destruction, but during each successive week gave way before the advancing force of small pox, which now began to assert its supremacy in power for destroying human life, and scarlet fever was at this critical period apparently worsted in the contest, and rapidly retired before its apparently stronger and more virulent foe; this is sharply and forcibly proved by reference to the figures in the Table. The relative mortality of the two diseases was now reversed, and so continued during the two following quarters, when small pox attained its maximum and scarlet fever its minimum of fatality. During the next quarter small pox considerably declined, while scarlet fever remained stationary at its reduced mortality. During this last quarter, it will be seen that the scarlet fever poison in the Metropolis was in its feeblest phase, and in our own Hamlet was absolutely exhausted, not a single death having occurred during the quarter. A closer analysis of the figures would further support these points : for instance, in May, 1871, when the greatest number of deaths from small pox occurred in Mile End, there was not, for the first time, a single death from small pox. These facts cannot fail to be at lease interesting and even suggestive of some conditions or laws by which the elements of the two diseases are modified, controlled, or neutralized, or to an antithesis in the nature and constitution of the disease germs, so that under varied propitious conditions, one is destructive and inimical to the existence of the other; on the other hand, these remarkable results may be accounted for by an identity in the nature of the materies morbi of the two diseases, which may be distinctive only by their external signs. In any case, the subject involved in the comparison of the extent and mortality of the two diseases dining special periods, is of sufficient interest in the study of preventive medicine, to merit some consideration, and possibly its further pursuit may be productive of some good, but a question of such indefinite proportions cannot be further prosecuted in this Report. The Census of 1871. During the past two years I have estimated the population of the Hamlet for the purposes of my Reports to the Health Committee at 90,000, and two years previous to that at 85,000 ; the population in 1861 being 73,064; hence the weekly rates of mortality given in my Reports have been closely in proportion to the average population during these periods. There are some interesting details to be observed by an analysis of the returns of the last census, as issued by the Board of Guardians, in relation to the public health, and to which I will briefly allude. In the North Ward, the increase of population during the ten years, was 3,849, or 25 per cent, upon the population of 1861. In 1861, there were 6.53 persons to each inhabited house; in 1871, 7 persons to each house; so that the population increased in a greater ratio than the new houses to accommodate them in the same numbers as in 1861. The increased population would have required to live to the number of 9.5 persons in each new house, but diffusing them through the entire Ward, reduces this to 7 persons, or half a person more than in 1861 to each house; but the distribution would of course not be equal, hence there is probably considerable overcrowding somewhere in this Ward. In the East Ward, during the same period, the increase has been 10,170, being 106 per cent, upon the population of 1861. Eight per cent, of the houses in this Ward, in 1871, were uninhabited; for 1861, I have estimated the same at 3 per cent. In 1861, the number of persons to each inhabited house was 6.45, and in 1871, 7.203 persons ; the increase being .753 to each house. In th 6 West Ward, the increase in the population was 614, or 4 per cent, upon the population of 1861, 2 per cent, of the houses were uninhabited. In 1861, there were 7.54 persons to each inhabited house ; in 1871, 7.73 persons. In the Centre Ward, the increase in population was 3,755 or 20.5 per cent, upon the population of 1861. In 1861, there were 6.32 persons to each inhabited house; and in 1871, 6.94 persons, nearly ¾ of a person more to each house. In the South Ward, the increase in population was 1694, or 11.25 per cent, upon the population of 1861. In 1861, there were 6.71 persons to each inhabited house; and in 1871, 7 persons, or about one-third of a person more. In the whole Hamlet, the number of persons to each house in 1861, was 6.71; and in 1871, 7,174, or not quite a person more to each house. There was an increase of 2,132 inhabited houses to accommodate 20,082 increase of population, or one house for every 9.41 persons. There was one inhabited house to every 1¾ separate families. The following is a tabular summary of the above: Analysis of Census in the five Wards. POPULATION. Increase No. of Persons to each House 1861. No,of persons to each house, 1871. Increase per cent. WARDS. 1861 1871. NORTH WARD 15412 3849 25 7 19261 6.53 EAST WARD 9573 10170 106 6.45 7.203 19743 WEST WARD 14806 15420 614 4 7.54 7.73 CENTRE WARD 18390 22145 3775 20.5 6.32 6.94 16577 SOUTH WARD 14883 1694 11.25 6.71 7 It will be seen by the Table, that the greatest increase in population over that of 1861, was in the Bast Ward, where the numbers have more than doubled. In the North and Centre Wards, the respective populations have increased about one-fourth; the South Ward, about one-eighth; and the West, about one twenty-fifth of the population of 1861. It will be further seen that the highest rate of mortality during the year in the West Ward, corresponds with the greatest number of persons to each house, although the increase of number of persons to each house over that of 1861, is the least in this Ward, presumably for the reason that all available space had been preoccupied ; but the density of population would not be the only or indeed the principal cause of this high rate of mortality, the houses themselves are more closely packed, there are more narrow courts and streets than in the other Wards, and the population of a large portion of the Ward being of the poorest in the Hamlet, the sanitary standard of the houses and their surroundings is proportionately low and defective. The next in density of population to each house is the East Ward, where also the increase of numbers of persons to each house, over 1861, is greater than in any other Ward; yet there has been a remarkably low death rate; there can be no question that this favorable circumstance is attributable to the better observance of sanitary principles in forming the streets and roads which are invariably wide, the houses modern and well drained, better ventilated and more wholesome, and not contaminated by old infection, decay, and dirt. Water Supply. So much has been said and written upon this subject, and I have, from time to time, reported upon various circumstances connected therewith, that I will now only summarize the analytical Reports referring to the East London Company's water, published by the Registrar General, as follows : — 1870, April Good, and compared favourably with the other river waters supplying the Metropolis. „ May.. Contained brownish particles and living organ-ism, other Metropolitan waters clear and transparent. „ June Good. „ July bad, the same as in May. „ Aug Ditto ditto „ Sept Good, exceptionally free from sewage contamination, as compared with the other river waters. „ Oct Ditto ditto „ Nov Ditto ditto 1871, Jan Bad, in comparison with other waters, contained living organisms. „ Feb... ...Good. „ March Turbid, and contained living organisms early in the month; was subsequently better and transparent. With the purest possible water the present system of storage which generally prevails, renders it continually liable to contamination, and to become a source of danger to health. Cisterns containing the water for drinking and other domestic purposes are placed in direct communication with the sewers through the medium of the water-closets, the water in the cistern may thus become aerated by the absorption of sewer air, and this might happen to contain emanations from the excretions of a typhoid, cholera, or other patient; a ready means for dissemination of disease is thus constantly in existence and in operation. Separate storage for domestic and closet purposes would almost entirely remove this source of danger. For the same reasons, there is here also a possible source of contamination of the water in the Company's mains, especially in the case of a cistern without water, and from defective fittings, allowing gases to pass from the closet into the cistern, and thence into the Company's pipes, this might easily occur with the small cisterns placed directly over water-closets, as part of the apparatus for giving constant service. Everybody knows that pure water is one of the first necessaries of life, but it is only one of many allied questions implicating injury to health and destruction of human life, which must await the time and convenience of the Government to cause to be legislated upon. Gas. The illuminating power of the gas supplied to the Hamlet by the Commercial Gas Company has never been below the standard required by the Act of Parliament, affecting this Company, viz., that the lighting power of the gas from an argand burner with 16 holes, shall be equal to that of 12 sperm candles. The average illuminating power, for the 12 months ending March last, was equal to 14.23 candles, or 2.23 above the standard required by the act in question, so that practically the Company supplies gas approaching in illuminating power to that which would be required from them under the recent Acts affecting the City Companies. Impurities.—Sulphuretted hydrogen was never present upon any occasion. Sulphur. —This impurity was present in varying quantities, and nearly always in excess of the quantity allowed by the Act of Parliament, viz., 20 grains of sulphur to 100 cubic feet of gas. The average quantity present at 26 testings was 30.61 grains to 100 feet of gas, or 10.61 grains in excess of the quantity allowed by the Act. It has been, however, proved that the requirements of the Act of 1860, with regard to sulphur, are quite impracticable, so much so, that in the more recent Acts affecting other Companies, no maximum amount of this impurity is fixed upon, and the gas referees have not yet been able to decide upon such quantity. Ammonia. —The average quantity of this impurity was 2.4 grains per 100 cubic feet of gas, or 2.6 grains less than the maximum allowed by the Act affecting this Company. I have the honor to remain, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant. M. CORNER. Sanitary Inpector's Retort of Works Executed during the year 1870- 71.

It is worthy of notice, according to my calculation, that the mortality per cent, of the population from Small Pox, in the whole Metropolis, for the same period, is relatively precisely the same as that for Mile End Old Town.
