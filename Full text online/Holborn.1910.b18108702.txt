PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, 197, HIGH HOLBORN, W.C. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Holborn. Gentlemen, In this Annual Report for the year 1910, the various statistics for the year refer to the fifty-two weeks ended Saturday, December 31st, 1910, as adopted by the Registrar-General, and known as the Registration year. The various birth and death rates have been corrected as far as possible by the exclusion of births and deaths of "non-residents" occurring in the Borough and the inclusion of those of "residents" occurring in institutions outside the Borough. The Holborn birth-rate was 19.1 per 1,000, in comparison with 18.3 for the preceding year. The London rate was 23.6 in comparison with 24.2 for the preceding year, and was the lowest rate recorded. The Holborn death-rate was 14.5 per 1,000, the lowest reported, in comparison with 15.0 for the preceding year. The London death-rate was 12.7 per 1,000 in comparison with 14.0 for 1909. The lowest death-rates in previous years in Holborn were 15.7 in 1908 and 16.6 in 1907. The average death-rate for the preceding decennium was 18.1 per 1,000, and for London 15.7 per 1,000. 6 I may point out that in Holborn there is a very much larger proportion of Common Lodging House accommodation than in any other Metropolitan Borough. 116 of the total of 768 deaths were of persons removed from those houses to Infirmaries, &c, The corrected infantile mortality (deaths of infants under 1 year of age) was 100 per 1,000 births, compared with 103 for London, which are both the lowest recorded. Last year these rates were 101 and 108 respectively. For both years the Holborn rates were lower than those for London. The death-rate from epidemic diseases in Holborn was again very low, and for the eighth year in succession, below that for London, viz.: 0.81 in comparison with 1.14 for London. The corrected death-rate from phthisis was 1.62 per 1,000 in comparison with 176 for 1909 and 2.24 for the preceding decennium. More than 30 percent. of the deaths were of persons who had been removed to Infirmaries from common lodging houses. The London rate was 1/14, the lowest recorded and 1.51 for the preceding decennium. The number of notifications of infectious diseases (excluding phthisis) was again small, having been only 181 in comparison with a decennial average of 384. The notification rate for Holborn was again lower than for London generally, being 3.4 per 1,000 in comparison with 4.5 for London. For each of the past eight years the Holborn notification rate has been lower than the London rate. The London County Council, with the approval of the Local Government Board, made an order for the extension of the notification of cases of cerebrospitial fever (epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis) for a further period of 12 months, and a further order has since been issued extending the notification for 12 months from March 13th, 1911. Ophthalmia Neonatorum (infectious inflammation of the eyes of newly born infants) was added to the list of notifiable diseases from and after the 13th March, 1911. Some details are given respecting the action taken in connection with the destruction of rats in the Borough. On account of the occurrence of some cases of Plague in East Suffolk the Local Government Board, in November, 1910, issued Regulations as to Plague and respecting the destruction of rats. 7 Questions respecting the housing of the working classes have received much attention during the year, and details of the action taken under the Housing Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, and the Regulations of the Local Government Board of September, 1910, dealing with the requirements respecting inspections and records to be kept are given on pages 26 to 29. The removal of house refuse was again satisfactorily carried out during the year, and very few complaints were received. Only one complaint was received respecting the non-removal of manure. I give an abstract of a detailed investigation and report respecting the poisoning of eleven persons in certain houses in Neal Street by fumes due to the fusing of an electric light cable. On pages 37-41 I give some details which indicate the superior food value of "standard" bread and flour. Evidence has been accumulating that the inner layer all cereals such as wheat, oats, rye, rice and maize contains an important substance or substances which are essential to the nutritive value of the grain, and that if these are eliminated in the milling or preparation of the grain a staple diet composed of cereals thus peeled not only fails adequately to nourish the consumers, but tends to set up active disease. I also give some abstracts from recent reports to the Local Government Board on the subject of the Bleaching of Flour and the addition of so-called "Improvers" to flour and the presence of Calcium Sulphate in Baking Powder and Self-raising Flour. Of 70 samples of imported flour, 57 or more than 80 per cent. were bleached, and of 157 samples purchased in different parts of England 117 or about 75 per cent. I give suggestions for a method that might be adopted for the "standardisation" of flour and bread. During the year 23,347 inspections were made, 1,299 Intimation Notices, and 194 Statutory Notices for sanitary defects were served; 628 notices for the cleansing of lodging houses and 202 notices for breaches of by-laws. The market streets were inspected daily, including Saturday nights and Sunday mornings. For further details see the various headings of the Report. I desire to express my appreciation of the excellent assistance and hearty co-operation that I have received from the staff of the Public Health Department during the year. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. A. BOND. 8 AREA, HOUSES AND POPULATION. Area. From the report of the Census, 1901, the area of the Borough is 405.l acres. Houses.

The corrected number of deaths of children under five years of age was:— St. Giles and Bloomsbury 52 Holborn Sub-District 109 Holborn Borough 161 The number of deaths of children under one year of age, and the number of deaths of children under one year of ago per 1,000 total registered births and per 1,000 corrected births, were the following for:— Deaths under 1 year of age. Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 registered births. Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 corrected legitimate births. Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 corrected illegitimate births. Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 corrected births.

It will be seen from the above Table that the deaths under one year of age per 1,000 corrected births were only 100 per 1,000, which is again the lowest recorded infantile mortality in the Borough, the preceding year being 101 per 1,000. Of the 102 deaths of infants during the year the Lady Sanitary Inspector was able to obtain further details respecting 94. In some cases, especially in the cases of illegitimate births, the mothers could not be found owing to changes of address, or incorrect addresses having been given. Of the 94 deaths respecting which further details were obtained, 28, principally cases of premature birth, died before taking food; only 37 were breast fed, 4 were partly, and 25 artificially fed. In 9 of these the mothers worked in factory or workshop, 6 were engaged in charing or other work outside the home, 10 were engaged in home work (tailoring), and 5 were in domestic service. There were only 9 deaths of infants from diarrhceal diseases, 6 being artificially fed. Of the 102 deaths 45 were from prenatal causes and 52 from postnatal causes, the remaining 5 being unascertained or doubtful. The principal causes of death of these 102 children under one year of age are given in Table V. of the Appendix. PREVENTION OF INFANTILE MORTALITY. (1) Care and Feeding of Infants. In previous Annual Reports I have given details respecting visits and inquiries made by the Lady Sanitary Inspector, with a view to improving the health of infants and diminishing the infantile mortality in the Borough. If thought desirable, instructions are given respecting the care and feeding of the child and a leaflet left. Notices are also served for any sanitary defects found. During the year 743 first visits were made. In 59 cases the mothers could not be traced, most of these being Workhouse cases. In the remaining 684 cases, 11 children did not live long enough to take any food, 63 were partly or entirely artificially fed, and 610 were breast fed at the time of the first visit, about a fortnight after birth. A large number of revisits were made, particularly in the cases of children who were not breast fed, and especially those who were feeding on modified milk. (2) Notification of Births Act, 1907, The total number of births notified in the Borough during the registration year 1910, was as follows:— 13 Notified once only (a) By Doctors 1041 (b) „ Midwives 197 (c) „ Parents and others 59 Notified twice (a) By Doctors and Parents 9 (b) „ Midwives and Parents – Total 1,306 During the same period 1,352 births were registered, During the year, Miss Orange made 743 primary visits respecting newlyborn children. She found that in 701 cases the births had been notified and in 42 cases not notified. Of the 42 cases not notified, 24 were attended by doctors, 5 by midwives, 10 by students, and in 3 cases the person in attendance on the mother at the time of the birth could not be ascertained. I wrote in most cases requesting the reasons for non-notification, from the doctors I had replies giving reasonable grounds for their not having done so. In the cases of midwives and students of hospitals, the reasons generally given were that the students, or midwives, had only been recently appointed, and were not aware of the Act, or that the notification had accidently been omitted. In all cases where the births had not been notified, Miss Orange informed the mothers that it was the duty of the father, and of any person in attendance on the mother at the time of, or within six hours after the birth, to notify the same. The mothers always replied that their husbands were ignorant of the Act. (3) Modified Milk for Infants. In my Annual Report for 1906 I gave a detailed report respecting this matter and the arrangements made with the Express Dairy Company, who have various depots in and near the Borough to supply modified milk for infants of the working classes at the reduced rate of 4d. per day on production of a certificate form me. During the year 44 new certificates were issued, of which 2 were not used. Including 17 children who were taking the milk at the beginning of the year 1910, the milk was used by 59 children during the year, in comparison with 56 during the previous year. In the majority of cases the mothers were very well satisfied and the infants thrived well on the milk, in 2 cases however the milk was not suitable. In a number of cases the use of the milk was after various periods and for various reasons discontinued; in eleven cases on account of the mothers leaving the Borough. 14 There were two deaths of infants who became ill while taking prepared milk. One was a healthy child that had taken the milk for six months, and died, age 9 months, from measles; the other a very small and delicate infant that took the milk from a fortnight old for about a month, and died in Hospital from abscess and broncho-pneumonia. SENILE MORTALITY. The number of deaths of persons 65 years of age and upwards was in:— St. Giles and Bloomsbury 110 Holborn Sub-District 105 Holborn Borough 215  St. Giles and Bloomsbury.

The following tables give details respecting the number of deaths, and the deathrates, from the seven principal epidemic diseases, viz.:—Small-pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria (including Membranous Croup), Whooping Cough, Fever (including Enteric or Typhoid, Typhus and Continued), and Diarrhoea. It will be seen that the number is only 43 in comparison with a decennial average of 89. The death-rate for the Borough was only 081 in comparison with 114 for London. Number. Epidemic Dcath-Rate.

Measles, although more prevalent than in the year 1909 was less fatal, and was again much less prevalent than in the year 1906. We received information of 234 cases in comparison with 139 in 1909, 86 in 1908, and 370 in 1906. All the schools were more or less affected. Of the 234 cases notified, a few were found not to be suffering from measles. Of 172 cases in which inquiries were made, it was found that 150 were attending school, 22 were under school age, and 11 of these contracted measles from other children in the family attending school. In 32 cases there was no doctor in attendance. 113 cases occurred in tenements of only one or two rooms. There were only 13 deaths in comparison with a decennial average of 22. Of these 4 belonged to St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 9 to the Holborn District. During the year the Education Department of the London County Council excluded all the unprotected children from certain classes, in the Infants' Department, of the undermentioned schools from and up to the dates specified:— Macklin Street (E.C.), Infant Class—1st to 15th May. St. John-the-Evangelist, Class C—4th to 20th July. Rosebery Avenue, Classes A & B—14th to 20th July. St. Albans, Class C—18th to 20th July. Christ Church, Class B—5th to 9th September. St. Giles in the Fields, Infant Class—12tli to 23rd September. Saffron Hill, Class A—18th to 25th November. Princeton Street, Class A—23rd November to 9th December. Tower Street, Class B—24th to 30th November. St. Albans, Class B—2nd to 23rd December. 17 WHOOPING COUGH. Whooping cough was returned as the cause of 16 deaths during the year, in comparison with 15 in the preceding year and a decennial average of 15.7. Five of the deaths were in St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 11 in the Holborn District. All were children under 5 years of age. DIARRHEA. The number of deaths from diarrhœa was only 6, in comparison with a decennial average of 27. Two belonged to St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 4 to the Holborn District. Four were children under 5 years of age, 2 being under 1 year of age. PHTHISIS. For details see pages 22-24. INFLUENZA. During the year there were 10 deaths registered as due to influenza, all in the Holborn District. ALCOHOLISM. Only 17 deaths were assigned to alcoholism or cirrhosis of liver, 6 in St. Giles and Bloomsbury. and 11 in the Holborn District. These represent only a portion of the deaths really caused by alcoholism, as they are frequently registered under the headings of other secondary causes. CANCER.

NOTIFICATIONS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. The number of notifications of infectious diseases in the Borough during 1910 was again small, having been only 181 in comparison with a decennial average of 384. During the past eight years the notifications per 1,000 of the population have been less than for London, and last year were 3.4 per 1,000 in comparison with 4.5 for London. This rate of 3.4 is again the lowest recorded for the Borough, and less than the lowest rate recorded for London. 19 NOTIFICATIONS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN THE BOROUGH DURING 1910, AND DURING THE PRECEDING TEN YEARS.

There was no notification of small pox in the Borough during the year. SCARLET FEVER. During the 52 weeks ended January 1st, 1910, the number of scarlet fever notifications, excluding duplicates was only 68, 29 belonging to St Giles and Bloomsbury and 39 to the Holborn District. In St. Giles District 27 cases were removed to hospital, and in the Holborn District all the whole 39. The number of notifications was only 1.3 per 1,000 in comparison with 2.2 for London. Errors in Diagnosis. During the year 14 patients were returned home from the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board reported as not suffering from scarlet fever, or 20.6 per cent. of the notifications, a very much larger percentage than in previous years. 21 Secondary Cases of Scarlet Fever. Excluding the above 14 eases, and 3 nurses at a Hospital, of the remaining 51 notifications, 43 occurred in houses in which there was no secondary case. In two houses there were 3 cases, in one of which two of the cases occurred in December of the previous year ; and in 2 houses 2 cases occurred. Return Cases of Scarlet Fever. There were no "return" cases, i.e., cases which occurred in a house soon after the return home of a patient from hospital. During the year only two cases were isolated at home, and one contracted the disease from the other who was then supposed to be free from infection. DIPHTHERIA. The number of cases of diphtheria notified was 45, of which 12 belonged to St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 33 to the Holborn District. All but one were removed to hospital. The average number of notifications for the preceding decennium was 77, 30 for St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 47 for the Holborn District. Errors in Diagnosis. Five patients were returned from the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board not suffering from diphtheria, or 11.1 per cent. of the patients notified. Secondary and return Cases of Diphtheria. In eight houses, including a hospital, two cases occurred. There was only one doubtful return case, and this occurred seven weeks after the return home of the primary case. ENTERIC FEVER. There were, excluding duplicates, 25 notifications in comparison with only 16 for the preceding year, and a decennial average of 32. Eight belonged to St. Giles and Bloomsbury, and 17 to the Holborn District. All but four of the cases were removed to hospital. All but three were notified in the latter half of the year, Of the 25 cases six were afterwards found to be not suffering from enteric fever. Of the remainder one was certainly, and two were probably, not contracted 22 in the Borough. Eight cases were apparently contracted from the eating of infected shellfish, principally mussels. In one case the cause was probably the handling of infected linen. CEREBRO SPINAL FEVER. (Epidemic Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis) and Post-Basic Meningitis. Only one case was notified during the year. The patient was an infant, and died about a month after admission to hospital. There were also two deaths attributed to this disease amongst " non-residents " who had been admitted to the Hospital for Sick Children. PHTHISIS OR CONSUMPTION. The number of deaths from phthisis during the year was 98, or a death-rate of l-84 per 1000, or l-62 if corrected for sex and age distribution. Of these 46 belonged to St. Giles and Bloomsbury, a death-rate of 1'64, and 52 to the Holborn District or a death-rate of 2'07 per 1000. Although the death-rate from phthisis is still high in the Borough there has been a satisfactory reduction in the death-rates during the past ten years as is shown in the table given below, and last year was the lowest recorded. It must also be remembered that in Holborn there is a much larger proportion of persons living in common lodging houses than in any other London Borough. In Holborn the rate is as many as 355 beds per 10,000 of the population; whereas in Hampstead there are no common lodging houses, and 12 Boroughs have less than one-tenth the proportion of Holborn. During the seven years 1904-1910 the average death-rate in common lodging houses in Holborn per 1000 beds was about 20. Also during the past seven years more than 30 per cent, of the deaths from phthisis in Holborn had been residents in common lodging houses in the Borough. During the past year of the 98 deaths, 33 had been removed to infirmaries from common lodging houses in the Borough, 24 from St. Giles and Bloomsbury, and 9 from the Holborn District. The corrected number of deaths in London was 5,555 equal to a rate of 1*14 per 1000, being the lowest recorded. The following table gives the number of deaths in the Holborn Borough and the death-rates per 1000 (crude and corrected for sex and age distribution of the Holborn population in comparison with London) and the corresponding rates for London, for the 11 years 1900-1910. 23 Year.

PUBLIC HEALTH (TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS, 1908. The Voluntary Notification of Consumption was in the first instance put into force for a period of 12 months from the 1st January, 1904, the fees to be paid being the same as for the notifiable diseases; it has been extended from time to time, on the last occasion for three years 1909-11 inclusive. As a large proportion of the voluntary notifications formerly received were Poor Law cases, the great majority are now compulsory notifications under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908. Excluding many duplicate notifications, there were 170 cases notified; 61 belonging to St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 109 to the Holborn District. The corresponding numbers for the year 1909 were respectively 342, 116 and 226. Of the total number 170 notifications received, 94, or 52 per cent.were residents of common lodging houses, and were all at once or soon afterwards removed to workhouse infirmaries. With few exceptions the remaining 76 lived in tenement houses. 41 of these were soon removed to infirmaries or hospitals so that only 18 remained at home, and some of these had previously been in sanatoria or infirmaries. In previous Annual Reports I gave details as to the action that is taken and the various results that were obtained from the enquiries made. I may however, remind the Council that a printed leaflet on the Prevention of Consumption, giving instructions for measures to be taken to prevent the spread of the disease, is left in all cases occurring in tenement houses. After death, or removal to infirmary or hospital, disinfection is advised Consent for this was obtained in 76 cases. 24 PUBLIC HEALTH (TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS, 1911. The Local Government Board recently issued an Order, which comes into operation on the 1st May, 1911, embodying further Regulations to provide for the notification of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis occurring amongst the in-patients or out-patients at hospitals, or other similar institutions for the treatment of the sick, which are supported wholly or partially otherwise than by the contributions of the patients (or of their relatives or guardians) and otherwise than from rates and taxes. REGULATIONS AS TO PLAGUE. Destruction of Rats. On account of complaints respecting the prevalence of rats in some parts of the Borough I was requested to report on the matter. In this report I pointed out not only are rats the chief agents in the spread of bubonic plague by means of rat fleas and also of other diseases such as trichinosis, but they also do an enormous amount of damage to property. The following recommendations were adopted:— (1.) That inquiries be made at all premises in the Borough, beginning with those likely to harbour rats, and notices served under The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, where necessary. (2.) That notices be served for all defective receptacles for food refuse, and the importance emphasised of their being properly covered. (3.) That notices be issued emphasising the importance of having all food stuffs kept covered and inaccessible to rats as far as practicable. In November, 1910, the Local Government Board issued regulations providing that in any district in which a representation is made to the Local Authority that rats in the district are infected or threatened with plague, or that there is an unusual mortality among rats in the district, the Local Authority shall report the matter to the Local Government Board, and shall take measures for the destruction of the rats and for preventing their entrance into buildings and other premises in the district. The Memorandum prepared by the Medical Officer of the Local Government Board dealing with the subject was also considered. Although there had been a somewhat extensive infection of rats in parts of East Suffolk accompanied by a few human cases, and a few infected rats had been discovered in the London Docks, it was felt there was no reason for any alarm or for believing that there was any infection among the rats in the Borough, and no further action was therefore considered necessary, at least for the present. 25 A large number of premises were inspected, and in many cases where rats were present, action was already being taken or at once promised by the occupiers, and notices were served where necessary. GLANDERS, ANTHRAX AND HYDROPHOBIA IN MAN. No notifications were received. BACTERIOLOGY. The following table gives details of the examinations made by the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine and the Royal Institute of Public Health during the year. District. Diphtheria.

As the Council's Shelter for the accommodation of persons during the disinfection of their houses at No. 191, High Holborn, was demolished in July, 1906, the Council made arrangements with the adjoining Borough of Finsbury for D 26 the use of their shelter. As the disinfectors work very early and very late, if required, it was only necessary to use the shelter during the year for the accommodation of 16 persons. CLEANSING OF PERSONS ACT. During the year 168 persons (157 men and 11 women) infested with vermin, had their bodies and clothing disinfected free of charge. All had their bodies cleansed in the baths of the St. Giles and Bloomsbury Casual Wards in Goldsmith Street, and 1,176 articles were disinfected in the Council's steam apparatus. Under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, powers are given to that Council for the compulsory cleansing of verminous children attending any of the Council's schools, and verminous inmates of any common lodging house. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACTS, 1890-1909. Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909. Sections 17 to 21 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, deals with amendment of procedure for closing orders and demolition orders for houses unfit for human habitation. In accordance with Section 17 (1) of the Act, it is the duty of the Council to cause to be made from time to time inspection of their district with a view to ascertaining whether any dwelling house therein is in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, and for that purpose to comply with such regulations and keep such records as may be prescribed by the Local Government Board. A communication was received from the Local Government Board, dated 3rd September, 1910, forwarding copy of an order making regulations with respect to the manner in which such inspection of the district shall be carried out, and with respect to the records to be kept. Article 1 of the Order requires the Authority to determine their procedure. which is to provide for thorough inspection of the dwelling houses or localities in the district, and also to cause to be prepared, from time to time a list of dwelling houses of which such inspection is desirable. Article 2 enumerates the matters in relation to which inspection should be made, and in addition to details respecting the sanitary condition of houses, includes the condition of dwelling houses with regard to light and the free circulation of air. 27 Article 3 proscribes the records to be kept. Under Article 4 the Local Authority is to take these records into consideration at each meeting, and give such directions, and take such action, as may be desirable in each case, and a note of such directions is to be added to the records. Article 5 requires the Medical Officer of Health to include in his Annual Report certain information and particulars as to inspections made; and Article 6 makes it the duty of the Medical Officer of Health and other Officers of the Local Authority to observe and execute orders and directions of the Authority under Section 17 and under the Regulations. The Local Government Board pointed out in their letter that it is open to the Local Authority, if they think fit, to delegate the duty of considering the records to a Committee. The various matters were carefully considered by the Housing of the Working Classes Committee who agreed that a "card" system should be adopted for keeping the records required, and the Council adopted the following recommendations:— (a.) "That it be referred to the Medical Officer of Health to pre"pare from time to time, and submit to the Housing of the Working "Classes Committee, a list or lists of dwelling houses, the early inspec" tion of which is, in his opinion, desirable." (b.) "That the male Sanitary Inspectors be designated officers "under the direction and supervision of the Medical Officers of Health, "to make inspections under Section 17 (1) of the Housing, Town Plan"ning, etc., Act, 1909, in accordance with the regulations of the Local "Government Board." (c.) "That it be referred to the Housing of the Working Classes "Committee to consider the records of inspections made under Section "17 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, to take such "action as they may consider necessary, and to report thereon, from "time to time, to the Council." Houses unfit for Human Habitation. I made a detailed report respecting Nos. 17 and 19, Short's Gardens, and represented No. 17 as being in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. This was a tenement house of 18 rooms, very high, consisting of six floors and a basement, and was occupied by 26 adults and 15 children. There d 2 28 was absence of proper light and ventilation to a number of the rooms, the greater part of the staircase, and some of the landings, sinks and dustbins. The premises were inspected by the Committee on two occasions, and on the recommendation of the Committee, the Council, in accordance with Section 17 (2) of the Act, made a "Closing Order" prohibiting the use of the dwelling house for human habitation until in the judgment of the Council the dwelling house is rendered fit for that purpose. The premises are jointly owned, and one of the owners appeared on two occasions before the Committee and after making various proposals finally submitted plans and specification which included the demolition of the four upper stories of the back addition. This demolition and works required are now in progress. It was not necessary to serve "Closing Orders" on the tenants. Underground Rooms habitually used as Sleeping Places. In accordance with Sub-Section 7 of the same Section (17) of the Act, "A room habitually used as a sleeping place, the surface of the floor of which "is more than three feet below the surface of the part of the street adjoining "or nearest to the room, shall for the purpose of this section be deemed to be ''a dwelling house so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human "habitation, if the room either— (a.) is not on an average at least seven feet in height from floor to ceiling; or (b.) "Does not comply with such regulations as the Local "Authority with the consent of the Local Government Board may "prescribe for securing the proper ventilation and lighting of such "rooms, and the protection thereof against dampness, effluvia, or ex"halation: Provided that if the Local Authority, after being required "to do so by the Local Government Board, fail to make such regula"tions, or such regulations as the Board approve, the Board may "themselves make them, and the regulations so made shall have effect "as if they had been made by the Local Authority with the consent "of the Board. ''Provided that a Closing Order made in respect of a room to which this ''sub-section applies shall not prevent the room being used for purposes ''other than those of a sleeping place; and that, if the occupier of the room "after notice of an order has been served upon him fails to comply with the "order, an order to comply therewith may, on summary conviction, be made "against him. A Closing Order made in respect of any room to which this 29 "sub-section applies shall not be treated as a Closing Order in respect of a "dwelling house for the purposes of Section 18 of the Act which deals with "Demolition Orders." I prepared suggested regulations in accordance with the above, and after careful consideration by the Committee the matter was adjourned for the present. Section 35 exempts from inhabited house duty lodging houses for the working classes; upon production of a certificate that the house is solely constructed and used to afford suitable accommodation for the lodgers, and that due provision is made for their sanitary requirements. I inspected and gave certificates for the following premises, all of which are common lodging houses : Municipal Lodging House, Parker Street. 28, Orde Hall Street. 39, Queen Square. 4, Greville Street. 40, Eagle Street. 25, Charles Street. Shaftesbury Chambers, 1 to 7, Macklin Street. Ashley Chambers, 6 and 7, Wild Court. 12 and 13, Tooks Court. 6, Betterton Street. I was also asked to give certificates for 19 and 21, Macklin Street, and 1 to 8, Kennedy Court, but the Act did not apply to those as a charge exceeding 6d. per night for each person is made.

During the year I inspected and gave certificates for the following premises:— 45, Bedford Eow. 33 WATER SUPPLY TO TENEMENT HOUSES. In accordance with Section 78 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, 80 notices were served for the provision of additional water supply in tenement houses, and in the majority of cases the work required was completed during the year. In cases where the lease of the premises expired within twelve months the notices were allowed to stand over. In the year 1908, when the above section first came into operation 403 such notices were served. BY-LAWS AS TO HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. At the end of the year, 641 houses were registered under these By-laws, of these, 339 are in St. Giles and Bloomsbury, and 302 in the Holborn District, 23 such houses were removed from the Register principally on account of the closing or demolition of the houses, and in some cases because the houses are now occupied only by members of one family, and 27 were added to the Register. Daring the year, there were 1,083 inspections of these premises, excluding a very large number of periodical inspections and re-inspections. 21 notices were served for 29 overcrowded rooms, and 181 notices for other breaches of the By-laws, exclusive of 628 notices that were served for annual cleansing as required by the By-laws. During the year, it was necessary to take legal proceedings in only three cases for breaches of the By-laws respecting cleansing. On the breaches being abated, and costs paid, the summonses were withdrawn. REVENUE ACTS. No applications were received during the year for Certificates from me under. the above Acts, except as applied to the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909. (See p. 29.) OVERCROWDING. The number of dwelling rooms found to be overcrowded was 49, in comparison with 56 in the previous year. 29 of these were dealt with as breaches of the By-laws as to houses let in lodgings. REMOVAL OF HOUSE REFUSE. In accordance with the Contract, all house refuse has to be removed at least twice a week, and oftener if required by the Medical Officer of Health. In the main thoroughfares there is a daily collection before 10 a.m. E 34 The new Contract commencing April, 1911, provides for the removal of all house refuse at least twice weekly throughout the year. During the year 22,892 loads of house refuse were removed. As usual, much attention was given to securing the regular removal of house refuse. A large number of inspections were made by me, and the inspectors, including early morning inspections, of the streets in which there is a daily removal. Only 23 genuine complaints respecting non-removal of house refuse were received from householders. 128 notices were served for the provision of proper dust receptacles. During the year a number of applications) were received for the removal of trade refuse for which the Contractor is paid by the owners in accordance with Section 33 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. I presented a Report suggesting an early daily removal of house refuse from all the houses in Russell Square, Bedford Place, Upper Bedford Place, Montague Street and Upper Montague Street, which the Contractor had agreed to undertake without any extra charge. This suggestion was approved by the Public Health Committee, but the Council did not adopt the recommendation. Arrangements were subsequently made for the ordinary collection of refuse from the houses in these thoroughfares to be increased to three times weekly. REMOVAL OF MANURE. The removal of manure was again carried out satisfactorily. Only one complaint was received, and that was during the August Bank Holiday week. Posters requiring the periodical removal of manure and other refuse matter from all stables, cowhouses, or other premises in the Borough not less frequently than every 48 hours were again posted in the various mews in the various mews in the Borough. COMMON LODGING HOUSES ACTS, 1851 and 1853 The Secretary of State by a Provisional Order, which came into operation on the 1st November, 1894, transferred to the London County Council the powers of the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police in respect of common lodging houses. The following is a list of the Common Lodging Houses registered in this Borough at the end of the year 1910:— Of these 14 are in St. Giles and Bloomsbury for 1,060 lodgers. „ 7 „ Holborn District for 622 „ Total 21 in the Borough for 1,682 „ 35 The Common Lodging houses at 25, Great Queen Street, and 28, Eed Lion Square were closed during the year.

BAKEHOUSES. At the end of the year 1910, there were 31 bakehouses in the Borough, of which 13 were in St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 18 in the Holborn District. The Bakehouses at 166, Drury Lane, 24, 26 & 28, New Oxford Street, and 88, Southampton Bow, were closed, and new ones occupied at 164, Drury Lane and 51, Farringdon Road.

During the year, in addition to my inspections, there were 188 inspections of bakehouses, including 12 inspections of the factory bakehouses. Ten notices were served for various sanitary defects. HOME WORK. All the out-workers' premises were inspected at least once during the year by the Lady Sanitary Inspector, details of which are given in the table. Many inspections of home-workers' premises are also made during house to house and periodical inspections of lodging houses and dwelling houses in which homeworkers reside. Further details respecting factories, workshops, laundries, workplaces and home work are given in Table TX. (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) of the Appendix. STANDARD BREAD AND FLOUR. Bleached and so-called "Improved" Bread and Flour. Although different kinds of wheat vary in composition, as the germ and inner layer of the husk each contains a higher percentage of proteid, fat and mineral matter, including phosphoric acid and iron, "standard" flour, i.e., 38 flour containing at least 80% of the whole wheat, including the germ and semolina, made from any kind of wheat or mixture of wheats, contains a larger percentage of each of the above constituents than fine white flour made from the corresponding wheat or mixture of wheats. There are also similar higher percentages in ''standard'' unpolished rice in comparison with those of white polished rice made from corresponding rice. Eijkman in 1896 showed that fowls fed on white polished rice (peeled rice) developed a polyneuritis similar to beri-beri, which was not the case when they were fed on unpeeled rice. Since then evidence has been accumulating that the inner layer of all cereals such as wheat, oats, rye, rice and maize contains an important substance or substances which are essential to the nutritive value of the grain, and that if these are eliminated in the milling or preparation of the grain, a staple diet composed of cereals thus peeled not only fails adequately to nourish the consumers but tends to set up active disease. The sturdy physique of Scotch peasants is well known. Their staple food is prepared from "unpeeled" oats and not "groats" which are peeled oats. In a large number of instances as reported by various observers in the East, beri-beri has been practically exterminated by the use of unpeeled rice. Respecting the etiology of beri-beri numerous researches have for years been carried out by many observers, and Schaumann in December, 1910, published a monograph giving a summary of these in addition to his own researches. Other researches have for some years been carried out by Drs. Fraser and Stanton at the Institute of Medical Research, Kuala Lumpur, Federated Malay States. They have proved that the substances contained in sifted rice polishings, which are effective in preventing polyneuritis, are contained in about 1½%of the weight of the original unpolished rice grain, and have given details of the method of obtaining this 1½%extract. Therefore ''standard'' rice might be taken to mean rice which contains at least 1½% of the substances obtained by this method from the rice. In the course of their researches they have also proved that the fats, which are contained in rice polishings in comparative abundance, are of no importance in preventing polyneuritis, and the same applies also to phytin, the calcium magnesium salt of an organic acid containing phosphorus. This phytin is precipitated on the addition of alcohol and contains 73% of the total amount of phosphorus pentoxide contained in the siftings. Recent researches in England by Dr. Hopkins, of Cambridge, Dr. Leonard Hill, of the London Hospital, and Drs. Edie and Simpson, of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, have also indicated the superior food value of "standard" bread. 39 It may be inferred from the similar microscopical structure of the inner layer of wheat and rice, each containing a layer or layers of aleurone cells, and from the similar chemical composition of the phytin obtained from the bran of wheat, rice and other cereals and the analogous composition of wheat and rice, that the substances contained in the inner layer of the husk and the germ of wheat will also be extracted by the same or similar means. A "standard" flour might therefore provisionally be taken as a flour which contains at least a definite percentage of substances thus extracted. The Bread and Food Reform League has for years been doing excellent pioneer work. It inaugurated its campaign by a meeting at the Mansion House in June, 1907, which I attended, and issued a manifesto which was signed by many eminent physicians, surgeons, analysts and scientists, and also signed by me, emphasising the importance of a standard being fixed for the nutritive value of what is sold as bread. This has been established for milk, and the standardisation of bread is even more important, as bread and flour form about two-fifths of the weight of food consumed by the working classes, and constitutes almost the sole diet of many poor children. Most people are aware that this campaign has this year been also taken up by the "Daily Mail." The President of the Local Government Board informed the House of Commons that the matter would have consideration; and three very valuable scientific reports have already been issued, viz:— (1.) On the Bleaching of Flour and the addition of so-called "Improvers" to Flour, by Dr. J. M. Hamill. (2.) On the Chemical Changes produced in Flour by Bleaching, by Dr. G. W. Monier-Williams. (3.) On the presence of Calcium Sulphate in Baking Powder and Self-raising Flour, by Dr. J. M. Hamill. A very large proportion of the flour now consumed in England has been bleached by nitrogen peroxide, which is the method now generally adopted. Of 70 samples of imported flour 57, or more than 80%, were bleached, and of 157 samples purchased in different parts of England 117 or about 75%. Bleached flour is not allowed to be made or sold for consumption in the United States of America, although inferior bleached flour is allowed to be exported. Bleaching is also prohibited in Australia, and in Switzerland bleaching is applied only to roller-milled flour. Space permits only a brief reference to some of the conclusions of the above reports. The alterations in, and the additions to, flour, which result from a high degree of bleaching by nitrogen peroxide, cannot be regarded as free from 40 risk to the consumer, especially when regard is had to the inhibitory effect of the bleaching agent on digestive processes and enzymes. Even in the case of flour which is bleached to the small extent which is at present ordinarily practised, it would in present knowledge be unwise to conclude that the process is attended by absolute freedom from risk. The fact that bleached flour has been shown to be something more than natural flour, the colour of which has been modified, is also of importance in considering whether bleached flour may properly be represented as geniune flour. Apart from any dietetic considerations, a large number of people desire bread of exceptional whiteness, and it is reasonable to suppose that what is demanded by those who prefer such bread is an article made from flour, the whiteness of which is due to its being prepared from specially selected wheats by the elaborate mechanical separation and "purification" of modern milling methods. Few people would carry their approval of whiteness to the extent of requiring naturally dark flour to be chemically treated. The above considerations apply also to the addition of "improvers" to flour. These articles can hardly be regarded as proper constituents of what is represented to be genuine flour. By the use of "improvers," flour from weak wheat is made to simulate flower from a stronger wheat, although as regards proteid content it is inferior to the flour which it imitates. Moreover, they permit more loaves to be made from a given quantity of flour, which means a diminution in the nutritive value of each loaf. The indiscriminate addition of powerful chemical substances, such as hydrofluoric acid, phosphorus pentachloride, and the oxides and sulphides of phosphorus to flour is most dangerous. At the present time, many millers are unaware of the nature and composition of the "improvers" which they add to flour, and are content with the assurance of chemical manufacturers that the preparations offered to them constitute in all respects desirable additions to flour. It must also be remembered that the addition of foreign substances may not be limited to the miller. The increasing activity which is now being displayed in the use of different articles as additions to flour must be regarded with considerable apprehension. It does not appear desirable that such an indispensable foodstuff as flour, the purity and wholesomeness of which are of first importance to the community, should be manipulated and treated with foreign substances, the utility of which, from the point of view of the consumer, is more than questionable. 41 Dr. J. M. Hamill in his Report on the presence of calcium sulphate in baking powder and in self-raising flour, states that some of the samples contained 50% or even more of calcium sulphate and an appreciable amount of arsenic, and that administrative action ought to be taken to prevent this. PLACES WHERE FOOD IS PREPARED FOR SALE. Under this head are included kitchens of hotels, restaurants and eatinghouses of all sorts, slaughter-houses, tripe, offal and other meat shops, fried fish, eel and other fish shops, premises where ice cream is made, and other places where food is prepared for sale, excluding bakehouses which are given on previous page. The number of these places on the register at the end of 1910 was 387; 2,216 inspections were made, and 93 notices were served during the year for sanitary defects found. In addition to the above inspections of places where food is prepared for sale, there were also 908 inspections of market streets, each of which includes a number of stalls at which meat, fish, fruit and vegetables are sold. These streets are also regularly inspected on Saturday evenings and Sunday mornings. SLAUGHTER HOUSE. There is now only one slaughter-house in the Borough, viz., No. 29, Red Lion Street, which, in addition to my inspections, was inspected on 11 occasions during the year. Only sheep are killed, and there was but little slaughtering during the year. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS AND MILKSHOPS. The number of registered dairies and milkshops in the Borough at the end of the year was 172, of which 72 were in St. Giles and Bloomsbury, and 100 in the Holborn District. Under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section 5, any Sanitary Authority may remove from, or refuse to enter on the Register, the name of any person carrying on, or proposing to carry on, the trade of a dairyman or purveyor of milk, upon premises which are in the opinion of such Sanitary Authority, for any reason unsuitable for the sale of milk therein. Details of the action taken were given in the last Annual Report. F 42 In all 21 dairies and milk shops were newly registered, 6 belonging to St. Giles and Bloomsbury, and 15 to the Holborn District. In 3 cases, alterations had to be carried out before the premises were suitable. In addition to my inspections the Sanitary Inspectors made 613 inspections of these premises, and 2 notices were served for sanitary defects or breaches of regulations, and in some cases alterations were carried out without the service of notices. The only cowshed in the Borough was closed in the early part of the year. ICE CREAM. During the year there were 40 premises in the Borough where ice cream was manufactured or sold, and in addition to my inspections, 120 inspections of these premises were made. One notice was served for sanitary defects. As ice cream is often made in the early morning, inspections between 6 and 9 a.m. were also occasionally made in order to ascertain whether there were any infringements of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902. No such infringement was found. UNSOUND FOOD. Applications were received for removal and destruction as trade refuse of the following articles of food, all of which were unsound and unfit for the food of man:— 597 crates Bananas. 13 Tins Liquid Eggs. 106 bundles Tomatoes. 1 Lemon Soles. 352 tins Preserved Fruits (assorted). 1 box Mackerel. 50 bottles Do. 75 tins Tinned Fish. 128 bottles Do. Vegetables, etc. OFFENSIVE FUMES FROM FACTORIES. During the year 1909 four new oil engines were provided by an Electric Supply Company; much nuisance was caused by offensive fumes emitted from the chimney shaft receiving the exhaust pipes from these engines, and many complaints were received. The matter received much careful consideration, and various alterations were carried out by the Company, and the exhaust pipes were carried up more than 20 feet above the top of the chimney shaft. As further complaints were received, the Company in 1910, carried up these exhaust pipes an additional 15 feet. Notwithstanding this, the nuisance continued from time to time. 43 Plans for the construction of a high chimney stack have been submitted to the London County Council. Complaints are occasionally received of nuisances from offensive fumes from other premises which have been dealt with in former years. These are now only due to some accident or temporary defect, and the nuisances are soon abated. POISONING BY FUMES DUE TO FUSING OF ELECTRIC LIGHT CABLE. Early on the morning of the 10th June the Police gave notice to the Borough Surveyor, of an escape of gas in several of the houses in Neal Street, and that a number of the occupiers had been poisoned by the "gas" and removed to hospital. The Borough Surveyor at once communicated with the Gas Light and Coke Company, Limited. No escape of coal gas however was found, but on opening up the public way in front of some of the houses the ground was found to be very hot, and the bitumen around the cables of the Charing Cross, West End and City Electricity Supply Company in a molten condition. The Borough Surveyor at once communicated with that Company, who found about 150 feet of their cables opposite the houses Nos. 48 to 68 had been fused. I made a careful investigation, and, at the request of the Local Government Board presented a detailed report respecting the matter. Eleven persons, viz., 6 from No. 56, 3 from No. 60, and 2 from No. 62, were taken to Charing Cross Hospital; those who were unconscious in ambulances. In addition, some other occupants of the houses informed me that although they did not go to hospital they suffered more or less. Dr. Mott kindly sent me full details respecting the cases, and expressed the opinion that the symptoms were due to carbon monoxide poisoning. In the houses where the cases occurred the front walls of the basements were defective, and the front areas and stall boards were quite enclosed so that the "gas" could easily enter the houses. At the other houses there were either open gratings over the front areas, or in the stall boards, or the front walls were well concreted, or a combination of these conditions, so that the "gas" could not enter those houses in any quantity. The Public Health Committee expressed the hope that the Local Government Board would see its way to advise as to the steps it might think desirable with a view to preventing as far as possible any recurrence of similar dangers. f 2 44 SMOKE ABATEMENT. The smoke shafts in the Borough were frequently kept under observation, and in 157 cases the inspections were recorded. 10 intimation notices and 2 statutory notices were served. For further details of Sanitary Work and Legal Proceedings see Tables VI., VII., VIII., IX., X. and XI. METEOROLOGY. The mean temperature of the year was 50.2 degrees, which is 0.1 degrees above the average for the preceding sixty-five years as taken by the Astronomer Royal. The rainfall was 28.06 inches, and was 3.93 inches above the average for the preceding sixty-five years. The total amount of bright sunshine recorded was 1,380 hours out of a total possible 4,458 hours, or 31 per cent., and it was 123 hours below the average for the preceding ten years.

Block 1 may, if desired, be used for the whole district; and blocks 2, 3, &c., for the several localities. In small districts without recognised divisions of known population this Table need not be filled up. (4) Deaths of residents occurring in public institutions beyond the district are to be included in sub-columns c of this Table, and those of non-residents registered in public institutions in the district excluded. (See note on Table I. as to meaning of terms "resident" and "non-resident.") (c) Deaths of residents occurring in public institutions, whether within or without the district, are to be allotted to the respective localities according to the addresses of the deceased. N.B.–The year 1900 refers to the old areas of the St. Giles and Holborn District Boards of Works. 47 TABLE III. Cases of Infectious Disease notified during the year 1910. Notifiable Disease.

A footnote should be added to show that this has been done. t The figures required in columns 2, 3 and 4 are the total number of lists received from those employers who comply strictlj with the statutory duty of sending two lists each year and of the entries of names of outworkers iti those lists. The entries in column 2 must necessarily be even numbers, as there will be two lists for each employer—in some previous returns odd numbers have been inserted. The figures in columns 3 and 4 will usually be (approximately) double of the number of individual outworkers whose names are given, since in the February and August lists of the same employer the same outworker's name will often be repeated. § In view of the wide discrepancies found to exist between the totals in the two columns when the returns are added together, it is desired that care may be taken to give exact figures. Only those addresses should be counted which have actually been received from or forwarded to other Councils during the year covered by the report. 56 TABLE IX—continued. 4.—Registered Workshops.
