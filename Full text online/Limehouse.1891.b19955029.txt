After lengthy negotiations with the Vestry of Mile Knd Old Town, a joint memorial was presented to the London County Council by the Board and that Vestry, asking the Council to contribute one-half of the expense of widening the Western end of Ben Jonson Road, and stating that in the event of the Council acceding to such request the Board would contribute one-fourth of such expense, not exceeding £1,000, the remaining fourth being borne by the Vestry of Mile Knd. In reply thereto a letter was received from the Clerk of the Council to the effect that upon the Board and the Vestry of Mile Knd Old Town, agreeing to carry out the Improvement, the Improvements Committee would be prepared to recommend the Council to contribute one-half of the net cost, not exceeding £3,070, the Council's estimate for the work being £6,140 This letter was referred to the Works Committee for consideration and report, and ultimately upon their recommendation the Board asked the Council to reconsider their decision, attention being called to a clause in the joint memorial—which had evidently been overlooked by the Council—to the effect that an Act of Parliament was necessary to enable the Board to contribute to an improvement outside the District. Up to the time of closing this Report the reply of the Council had not been received. 47 COMMERCIAL ROAD, LIMEHOUSE In my last Annual Report, I stated with regard to the proposed widening of Commercial Road at Limchousc, as shown on a plan submitted to the Council by the Hoard, that the Council had enquired (i) whether a scheme for throwing part of the land on the South side of the road into the public way at an estimated cost of £2,000, as shewn upon a plan accompanying the letter from the Council, would meet the necessities of the case ; (2) whether the Hoard would be prepared to contribute towards the cost of the improvement, and if so to what extent; and (3) whether the Hoard had ascertained if the North Metropolitan Tramways' Company would be willing to contribute to the cost. The matter was considered by the Works Committee, and upon their recommendation the Council were informed (1) That the Hoard approved the suggested widening on the South side of the Commercial Road as shewn on the Council's plan ; (2) That the Board objected to contribute towards the cost thereof, as they considered the work should be carried out as a County Improvement; and (3) That a letter should be addressed to the Tramways' Company asking whether the Company would be disposed to bear a part of the expense of the proposed improvement I thereupon communicated with the Company, and received a reply from the General Manager to the effect that the recent duplication of the tramway lines at the place in question fulfilled all the Company's requirements, and that while the proposed widening would undoubtedly be of great advantage to the general traffic it would not be of any pecuniary advantage to the Company, and the Directors therefore did not see their way to contribute to the cost A copy of such letter was sent to the London County Council, who afterwards wrote stating that they were not at present prepared to carry out the suggested improvement BROAD STREET. As stated in my last Report, a memorial was presented to the London County Council asking them to carry out as a County Improvement the proposed extension of Dorset Street to Brook Street, and the formation of a thoroughfare in con- 48 tinuation thereof from Crainford Street to Broad Street, and also the widening of Broad Street from Schoolhousc Lane as far as No, 83. Broad Street On the 1st July a deputation frond the Board attended the Improvements Committee of the Council in support of the memorial, and in October a letter was received stating that the Council was not prepared to undertake] the suggested improvement. This subject will be found further referred to in my Report on the Queen Catherine Court scheme under the; Housing of the Working Classes Act (Sec below). NEW GRAVEL LANE &c. The letter, mentioned in my last Annual Report, from the London County Council stating that the Council was not prepared to entertain the suggested widening of New Gravel Lane and Wapping Wall, and the formation of a new street from Wagner's Place to Monza Street, was considered by the Works Committee, who reported to the Board that they were of opinion that the Board should not contribute towards such improvements. BIRCHFIELD STREET Under an arrangement made some years ago with the Poplar District Board for the widening of Birchfield Street, it was agreed that when the leases of the houses on the east side at the North end of the street expired that Board would set back the railings to the improved line of the street. As the leases in question expired on the 29th September 1892, I wrote to the Clerk of the Poplar Board on the subject who informed me that directions had been given for the completion of the improvement without delay. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT. QUEEN CATHERINE COURT AREA On the 4th May I reported to the Works Committee, with reference to the preparation of a scheme for the improvement 49 of the above area, that I had carefully inspected the houses with the Medical Officer, and I submitted a plan of a scheme from which it appeared that to deal with the site in the most complete manner the following premises would have to be Acquired, viz.: Nos 109 111, 113, 115 and 117, Brook Street; Nos. 1 to 8, Queen Catherine Court; Nos. 1 to 8. Little Queen Catherine Court; Nos. 36, 36a and 38, Caroline Street; Nos. 1 to 5, Susannah Row and No. 31, Dorset Street, the total area of which was nearly 12,000 feet super ; my estimate of the cost of acquiring the property being £7,270. I also submitted a plan of an alternative scheme, which would lessen the cost by diminishing the area, comprising the houses in Queen Catherine Court, Little queen Catherine Court, Susannah Row, and Nos. 36, 36a and 38, Caroline Street, the cost of acquiring which I estimated at £3.787, the area being nearly 8,350 feet. In view of the importance of the matter the Committee adjourned the consideration thereof until their first meeting in June. The Committee subsequently considered the scheme and inspected the area, and on the 8th July the Board on their recommendation postponed the further consideration thereof until the decision of the London County Council was given with regard to the proposed new road from Dorset Street to Broad Street. In October the Council informed the Board that they were not prepared to undertake the improvement in question, and the question of dealing with the area was therepon re-opened by the Sanitary Committee, who before taking any further steps directed that the C ouncil should be asked whether there was any probablility of the site cleared by the late Metropolitan Board of Works—within a few yards of the area—being utilised for artiznas' dwellings and, if so, the probable time when the works Would be carried out. The reply of the Council, read at the meeting of the Board on the 2nd December, was to the effect that the site referred to would be put up to auction in January, and would be subject to the condition that cottage dwellings should be erected thereon. At the same time another letter from the Council was read stating that unless schemes for the improvement of the Queen Catherine Court and other areas were prepared by the Board, and the necessary notices to the owners 50 and occupiers of the houses served within two months, the Housing of the Working Classes Committee would be under the necessity of recommending the Council to prepare schcmcs in pursuance of its powers under Section 46 (5) (6) of the Housing of the Working Classes Act. On the 16th December the Hoard resolved to inform the Council with respect to the preparation of schemes for dealing with unhealthy areas in general, and the Queen Catherine Court area in particular, that they hesitated to take any steps which would deprive the inhabitants of their homes until suitable cottage dwellings—of which there was great dearth—were erected on the Hrook Street site. To this the Council replied that there was every probability that suitable buildings would have been erected on the Hrook Street site by the time the schemes were carried out and the persons displaced, and the Council expressed the hope that the Hoard would at once prepare schcmcs and serve the necessary notices. On the 13th January last I submitted to the Sanitary Committee plans which I had prepared for the development of the Queen Catherine Court area, including the extension of Dorset Street to Hrook Street, and the formation of a new passage from Dorset Street to Caroline Street, and also the construction of five blocks of artizans' dwellings. These plans were approved by the Hoard and subsequently sent to the London County Conncil with a request that the Council would contribute one half of the cost of carrying the scheme into effect. The Council having considered the same, suggested the adoption of an alternative scheme in accordance with a plan accompanying their letter, and the same was under discussion by the Sanitary Committee at the time of closing this Report. KING JOHN'S COURT AREA On the 22nd June I submitted to the Works Committee a plan of the unhealthy area in King John's Court and Limehouse Causeway, comprising Nos. 115 & 117, Three Colt Street, No. So, Gill Street, Nos. 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85. 91, 93 and 95, Limehouse Causeway, the cottages in King John's Court, the 51 sites of No. 87 and 89, Limehouse Causeway (recently pulled down), and vacant land in King John's Court, the total area being 8,500 superficial feet. The Committee subsequently inspected the area, and I was requested to prepare a scheme shewing how the area could be developed for the erection of cottage dwellings. On the 20th July 1 accordingly submitted plans to the Committee and reported as follows:— "The area dealt with comprises the whole of the premises "and vacant land shewn by the pink tint upon the accompanying "tracing No. 11. 13, having frontages to Limchousc Causeway "on the North, Three Colt Street on the West, King John's "Court on the South, and Gill Street on the East. "Tracing No. 11. 16 shews a scheme for developing this "area for residential purposes by the construction of two 2-storcy "cottages to front Gill Street, two to front Three Colt Street, "and seven to front Limehouse Causeway. "Drawing No. 11. 18 shews in detail the ground plan and "section of the cottages proposed to be erected, from which it "will be seen that each cottage comprises a complete tenement "of three or two rooms on each floor, those on the upper floors "being reached by external stone stairs direct from the street "The accommodation thus provided comprises on the "ground floor nine 3-roomed houses and two 2-roomed houses, "and on the first floor also nine 3-roomcd and two 2-roomed "houses, giving a total of 62 rooms, which at the usual calcula"tion of two persons per room allows for 124 persons. "Each two-roomed house has a living room and bed room; "and each three-roomed house has a living room and 2 bed "rooms, all of the area and height recommended by the London "County Council. "Every tenement has separate W.C., and joint use with the "tenement above or below it of the wash-house and yard in the 52 "rear, the first floor tenements having external stairs as shewn "to give access to the yards. " I have not included King John's Court in the scheme, as I "am of opinion that it would be illegal to stop up same and that "the frontagers could successfully resist the stoppage. "The scheme includes the rectification of the frontages "afiectcd thereby." The consideration of the scheme was deferred by the Committee and I was requested to communicate with the parties interested in King John's Court as to the purchase of any rights they might have of access to the Court This I did, and on the 25th November I submitted amended plans, providing for stopping up King John's Court which was to form part of the new building site. The Hoard approved these plans, which were on the 7th December sent to the london County Council with an intimation that the Board was prepared to preced w ith the scheme forthwith if the Council would contribute one-half of the cost. In reply the board was informed that the Housing of the Working Classes Committee were unable to recommend the Council to approve the scheme as it then stood, but that if certain alterations were made the Council would be prepared to contribute one-half the cost. I had an interview with thcSupcrintcnding Architect of the Council upon the subject, and the matter is still under consideration. CHUSAN PLACE AREA On the 22nd June I submitted to the Works Committee a plan of the unhealthy area in Chusan Place and Ann's Place, Limehouse, comprising Nos. 1, 3, 5 and 7, on the West side, and a cottage partly dismantled (No. 1½) on the East side of Chusan Place, seven houses (closed) on the West side of Chusan Place, and seven houses (also closed) on the East side of Ann's Place, the total area being 4,225 superficial feet. The Committee subsequently inspected the area and on the 53 20th July, I laid before the Committee a schcme for the improvement thereof and reported as follows:— M The area dealt with comprises the whole of the premises "in Chusan Place and Ann's Row, Limchousc, shewn by the "pink tint upon the accompanying tracing No. II. 14. "Tracing No II. 17 shews a scheme for developing this "area for residential purposes by the construction of eleven "2-storey cottages. "The scheme provides for the removal of the cottage "No. Chusan Place, and of the range of W.C.'s adjoining on "the East side of Chusan Place, the site of which will be thrown "into the public way. "Drawing No. II. 18 shows in detail the ground plan and "section of the cottages proposed to be erected, from which it "will be seen that each cottage contains a living room and small "wash-house on the ground floor, and a bed room over the "living room, all of the area and height recommended by the "County Council. "Kach cottage has a yard in the rear and a separate W.C. "The accommodation thus provided comprises eleven 2"roomed houses, or 22 rooms, which at the usual allowance of "two persons to a room gives accommodation for 44 persons." The Committee recommended the Board to approve and adopt the scheme, but the Hoard decided to refer the matter back to the Committee for further consideration, and up to the end of the period dealt with in this report no conclusion had been arrived at. DUSTING, &.c., ARRANGEMENTS. The Special Committee appointed by the Board to formulate and submit to the Board a scheme for the efficient removal of dust, slopping and watering, held several meetings, the result 54 of which will best be shewn by the following Reports presented by them to the Board, viz.:- "Your Committee have approached the consideration of "the subject referred to them with a deep sense of its importance "to the health, comfort, and convenience of the ratepayers. The "matter has been very fully discussed at three meetings, and a "quantity of information and statistics furnished by the "neighbouring Local Authorities of Bcthnal Green, St. Gcorge"in-thc-East, Shorcditch, Whitechapcl, Hackney, and Poplar, vhas been laid before the Committee, and as a result of their "deliberations your Committee beg to state as follows: "I.—With regard to the removal of Dust your Committee "are of opinion: "(a) That the pail system should be adopted throughout "the District, and that one pail should be supplied to each "family living in a house ; "(b) That the District should be divided into 3 sections "corresponding to the Districts at present under the control of "the Sanitary Inspectors, and that a Dust Inspector, under the "immediate supervision of the Sanitary Inspectors, should be "appointed by the Board for each of such sections respectively "to superintend and assist in the removal of dust ; "(c) That the Dust Inspectors should be paid 25/. per week "each and be furnished by the Board with uniform caps, and "that they should be forbidden to accept gratuities , "(d) That the Ccntractors should be required to call at "each house in the District twice at least in every week, asfar as "practicable between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., to remove "the dust; (e) 1 hat handbills should be circulated amongst the housc"holders throughout the District setting forth the arrangements "for the removal of dust and the days and hours of collection. 55 "2.—With regard to the slopping and watering of the "District your Committee having carefully considered the "question arc of opinion that the present system should be "continued." The foregoing Report was received and adopted, and the Committee was authorised to take the necessary steps to carry out the scheme set out therein for the removal of house refuse. A further Report was presented on the 23rd September as follows:- "It will be within the recollection of the Board that on the "24th June last your Committee presented a Report embodying "a scheme for the more efficient removal of house refuse in the "District, and that the Board approved such Report and "authorised your Committee to take the necessary steps to "carry out the scheme. "Your Committee now beg to report as follows:— "1.—That in pursuance of the authority vested in them as "aforesaid they have appointed James Archer, Robert Wooland, "and Walter Morgan, who have been employed by the Board "as sweepers, to act as Dust Collectors, and have given an order "for them to be supplied with caps. "2.—That the Dust Collectors commenced their duties on "the 14th September instant, and have been engaged in "delivering pails, and in assisting the Inspectors in getting the "dust removed under the existing contracts. "3.—That your Committee have directed that books be "prepared in accorJance with a pattern approved by them, "giving the dates and particulars of the dust collection from "every house. "4.—That they have directed that cards be printed and left "at every house in the District setting forth the arrangements "for the removal of dust, and the days of collection. " "5.—That they have approved a plan prepared by the "Surveyor for the division of the District into blocks so as to "ensure the prompt removal of dust from every house twice a "week." The Report was received and adopted. The Committee was dissolved by the Hoard on the 23rd September, the subject then being allocated to the aewly appointed Sanitary Committee. '1 he new system of removal of house refuse continues to work satisfactorily. ENCLOSURE OF A PORTION OF PAINTER S RENTS, RATCLIFF. In April Messrs. Batger 8c Co., of Broad Street, Ratclitf, wrote to the Hoard stating that for some time past they had suffered from robberies and attempts to break into their premises from Painter's Rents, and that damage was caused by the throwing of stones and other missiles; and asking; with a view to the prevention thereof that the Hoard would allow a wall to be built to part off a portion of the north end of l iintir's Rents as shewn upon the plan accompanying the letter. Messrs. Batger also stated that in the event of the Hoard acceding to the application they would be willing to erect at their own expense a brick dustbin in lieu of the existing one in Painter's Rents if required by the Hoard. The Hoard granted the permission asked upon the following conditions, viz.: That possession of the land enclosed should be given up to the Hoard at any time when required upon one month's notice in writing being given to Messrs. Hatter to that effect, in which case the said wall should be removed by Mcsms. Batger, in default thereof the Board being authorised to remove the same at Messrs. Batgcr's expense, and to appropriate the materials as the Board might think fit; and that a rent of 5s. per annum in advance be paid by Messrs. Batger. Application was subsequently made by Messrs. Batger for permission to construct a fire-proof bridge across the North end 57 of Painter's Rents, for the purpose of connccting the main factory with a new building facing Butcher Row. The Board granted the application upon the usual terms. EMANATIONS FROM SEWERS. On the 6th July I reported as follows upon the question of the noxious effluvia arising from the main drainage system in the locality of St. Paul s Road. Limehousc. "Report upon the question of the Noxious Effluvia arising "from the Main Drainage System in the locality of St. Paul's "Road, Limchouse:— "The Engineer of the London County Council states that:— "In order that sewer ventilation in any particular district may be "effective, it is neccssary that not only the main or intercepting "sewers should be fullvvenlilatcd.butth.it the local sewers should "also be properly ventilated, otherwise that the foul air generated "'these latter sewers is driven into the main sewers, thus causing "'a concentration of foul air, the escape of which, at the street "'level, is often a cause of complaint.' The Engineer "further states that:—'Upon an examination of about "'2o miles of local sewers within the area complained "'of, i.e, through the districts of Limchouseand Bromley to the '"Abbey Mills Pumping Station, it was found that the ventilators "'were entirely insufficient in number and size, there being on an "'average, only four per mile, or one-fifth of the number "'which is considered necessary.' The Engineer also 'expresses the opinion in which the Main Drainage "Committee of the Council concur, 'that until the local "'sewers are fully ventilated either by the construction of a large "'number of additional ventilators at the street level, or by other ''means.it will be useless to hope that the Council will be enabled "'effectively to deal with the ventilation of the main lines. "Upon these statements I wish to make the following "observations, viz.:— "That no noxious smell proceeded from the district sewers 58 1 "until they were conncctcd with the main drainage, since which "time the nuisance has been steadily increasing. 'I he allegation "that the foul air from the district sewers is driven into the main "sewers is evidently incorrect "The foul air generated in the main sewers forces its way "into the district sewers, and thus causes the emission of noxious "effluvia. The district sewers are kept perfectly clean, and no "sewer gas, to a sufficient extent to cause a nuisancers generated " therein ; but the foul gas is forced from the main sewer into the "local sewers,and when the main drainage system is overcharged "the evil is greatly increased. "The multiplication of ventilators to the district sewers "would only spread the nuisance over a greater area, and affect "prejudicially a much larger number of the occupiers of houses " in the locality. "It is evident that the proper course to be pursued is at once "to efficiently ventilate the main drainage system,independently "of the district sewers. This has never been done, and the "temporary stopping of the ventilators of the main sewer only "adds to the evil by increasing the pressure of noxious gas in the "district sewers, and thus causing the intolerable nuisancc which "has been complained of for so many years. "A letter has been received from the Chief Engineer of "the Council, dated the 3rd inst, respecting the complaint of "Mr. Scouler, of 234, Burdctt Road, to the following effect:— "'The Main Drainage Committee of the Council have had before them a letter, dated the 5th ulto, from Mr. H. Scouler, "'as to offensive smells proceeding from two sewer ventilators "'near his house,No. 234, Hurdett Road, Limchouse. One of these "'ventilators belongs to the Council, and I have had it "'temporarily closed, but the other is vested in the Liinehouse "'District Board, and I am directed by the Committee to request "'you attention thereto." "This communication strengthens me in the opinions I "have before stated. 59 "The temporary closing of the ventilator belonging to the "Council, has forced the gas in greater volume through the dis"trictsewer ventilators, and if the same were closed, the follow* ing evils would arise:— "The sewer gas would be forced through the house drains "and traps into the houses, instead of being discharged in the "street. If, as I suggest, the main drainage sewer is sufficiently "ventilated, then the nuisance will be to a great extent removed, "but I am of opinion that the better plan would be to deodorize vthe sewage, and thus prevent the generation of foul gas. "I would suggest that the London County Council be "requested to give their immediate attention to the matter, with "the view of at once efficiently and effectively ventilating the "main sewers in the district, or by deodorizing the sewage before "it reaches the outfall at Barking. A copy of such Report was sent to the London County Council with a request that their serious attention might be given thereto, and copies were also sent to the representatives of the Division on the Council. Deodorizing operations were commenced in the District on the 24th June, and subsequently a letter was received from the Council stating that with a view to prevent sewer air passing into the local sewers from the Northern low level line, directions had been given for the placing of flaps on the three connections between the Limekiln Dock or Upper Sewer on the Northern low level line. CONSTRUCTION OF SEWERS. A letter dated 22nd April, 1891, was received from the London County Council, asking that new sewers should be constructed in accordance with plans and sections approved by the Council, and that the Council should have an accurate record of the particulars of all sewers constructed in the District. In reply, the Council was informed that it was the practice to construct all sewers in accordance with the plans and sections approved by the Council, and that the Board had no objection to the suggestion of the Council that within thirteen months alter 60 the approval by the Council of plans and sections of any local sewer the Hoard should deposit with the Chief Engineer of the Council a copy of each plan and section so approved, with a certificate thereon signed by the Surveyor of the Board, that the sewer and works connected therewith had been constructed in accordance with such approved plan and section. A letter was also received from the Council, dated luh May, 1891, suggesting that Vestries and District Hoards should, previously to sanctioning the construction of any new sewers, make a provision to the following effect That the |»crson or persons constructing such sewers should undertake to form in connection therewith a proper number of road ventilators, as well as a sufficient number of ventilating pipes or shafts, to be carried up the buildings, when erected, abutting upon the streets. In reply the Council were informed that the Board had always formed, in connection with new sewers, such a number of road ventilators as they thought sufficient, but that with respect to constructing ventilating pipes or shafts to be carried up the fronts of premises abutting on the streets, the Board was of opinion that it would be found impracticable to carry this into effect. The Board in October last gave directions for a plan to be prepared shewing the house drains, local sewers, main sewcrs, sewer ventilators, &c., in the District, and the same is being proceeded with. BLACKWALL RAILWAY WIDENING. In the month of June I received from the Engineer of the Great Eastern Railway plans of the details of bridges crossing the roads in the District, and required for the widening of the London and Hlackwall Railway. Also a letter from the Engineer of the London County ( ouncil stating that if I had any suggestions to inake with reference to such plans he would embody them in his requirements. I examined the drawings carefully as to the details, &c., and the Act of Parliament, and informed the Engineer of the Railway Company that I saw no objection to the plans being carried out subject to certain stipulations and conditions, a copy of which I sent to the Engineer of the County Council. 61 On the 9th September I reported that the Contractors for the Blackball Railway widening had given notice to permanently stop up Little John Street and James Street, Ratcliff, under the powers of the London and Black wall Railway Acts 1885 and 1888, and such streets had been permanently stopped up accordingly. Also that by the stoppage of Little John Street the arch next Dorset Street, the property of the Board, would be prejudicially affected, the frontage to Little John Street would be taken away, and by the construction of the widened portion of the Railway the light and air of the disinfecting chamber and the mortuary would \x seriously affected. The Board authorised me to communicate with the Railway Company ujx>n the subject and report the result to the Works Committee who could then consider the matter fully and report to the Board what steps in their opinion should be taken to protect the interests of the District Ultimately 1 made a claim on behalf of the Board and after consultation with the Company's Solicitors and Surveyor it was [arranged that the Company should |>ay to the Board the sum of £100. The Board approved the terms and the matter was left In my hands with the object of, if possible, making some Eurranginent for the acquisition by the Board of the two adjoining arches and the land South thereof, and negotiations arc still Bending On the 23rd September I reported that the Blackwall Rail way Company under the powers of their Act authorising the widening of the Railway had permanently stopped up Little John Street Also that the Act provided that in such case the Company should pay the value of the paving and other works, matters, and things belonging to the Board, and that I had acordingy taken the necessary particulars and made out an count shewing the value of the paving, &c., amounting to £ 38 5s. 9d., which the Great Eastern Railway Company have paid. On the 6th January I made a similar report with regard to James Street, the amount paid by the Company for paving, &c., being £92 15s. 0d. 62 MAINTENANCE OF DISTURNPIKED ROADS. In my last Annual Report I stated that the Board hid concurred in the suggestion of the London County Council that when the award of the arbitrator with regard to the maintenance of the Finchley and Edgware Roads became known, it might be found unnecessary to incur the expense of arbitration in reference to the amount to be paid by the Council in respect to the maintenance of the Disturnpiked Roads in this District. Considerable delay took place in the issue of the award referred to, and on the 2nd Dcccmber the Board resolved:—"That application be made to "the London County Council for a contribution on account of all "works,not being paving, carried out by the Board in respect of the "Disturnpiked Roads in the District during the years 1889 and "1890, without prejudice to the general question of the payment "by the Council for the repairs and maintenance of such roads, "and that the sum of £ t,000 for each of the years mentioned be "suggested to the Council." In reply to the application made in accordance with surh resolution the Solicitor of the Council wrote that if the Board would accept without prejudice and on account of the cost of maintenance and repairs, &c, of main roads the sum of £450 for the year ending Lady-day 1890, and £450 for the year ending Lady-day 1891, the Highways Committee would recommend the Council to draw a cheque for those amounts on account. The Board agreed thereto, and the sum of £900 was received from the Council in due course. LONDON BUILDING LAW (CONSOLIDATION) BILL. In September a letter was received from the Local Government Board, with draft of a Bill for the purpose of consolidating the enactments relating to the construction and use of buildings in London, and requesting to be furnished with any observations or suggestions which the Board desired to offer thereon. The draft Bill was considered by the Works Committee, and the Board was represented at a Conference upon the subject convened by the Vestry of St. Mary Abbott's, Kensington, at which certain resolutions were passed, copies thereof being forwarded to the Local Government Board. Ultimately the Local Government Board was informed as follows:— 63 That the Hoard did not agree with the resolution passed by the Conference as to the office and functions of District Surveyors and in favor of the same being transferred to the local authorities. That the Board agreed with the suggestion that appeals should be made in the first instance to the London County Council, with a further appeal to the Tribunal of Arbitration mentioned in clause 85 of the Consolidation Bill. That the Board did not support the recommendation that in future no street, whether intended for vehicular or pedestrian traffic, should be laid out of a less width than 40 feet. That the Board did not acquiesce in the suggestion that provision should be made in an Amendment Bill for placing a further restricted limitation on the height of buildings to be erected in old thoroughfares. STREET NOMENCLATURE. Upon the application of the Board an order was made by the London County Council for re-numbering Hilton Street, Katcliff. Orders were also made as follows Ann's Place. Jamaica Place, re-named "Arno Place." North Street, re-named "Elsa Street." Union Place, Gill Street, re-named "Gill Place." Providence Place, Hallcy Street, re-named " Lufton Place." Providcncc Place, Limchousc Causeway, re-named "Holker Place," and the houses rc-numbcrcd. The new names were painted up, and in the cases of Hilton Street and Holker Place, notices were served upon the respective owners requiring them to paint or affix the new numbers. UNION STAIRS, WAPPING. In consequence of a letter received from the London County Council, notice boards were put up, one at the North end and one at the South end of the passage leading to Union Stairs, VVapping, calling attention to the regulations with regard to the Tide Gate, and the penalties for interfering therewith. 64 310/13476 In January last I submitted a plan of a suggested permanent Ji flood work at Union Stairs, in lieu of the Tide Gate, the estimated h cost being L I 50. The Board approved the same, and the work ^ will be proceeded with when the necessary consents of the e Thames Conservancy and the London County Council have been obtained. SNOW STORMS. Heavy falls of snow took place on the 9th and JOth March 1892, and in order to clear the streets it was nece s.iry for the Board's regular men to work overtime, and for extra labor to be employed, the expense incurred being £169s. id. STREET AMBULANCES. The Hospitals Association has placed a street ambulance under the railway arch in York Street East. In March, 1892, the Hon. Sec. of the Association wrote asking the Board to intimate the situations in the District where accidents were of such frequency that ambulance would be of service, and stating that the Association would, on receipt of the information, take early steps to supply additional ambulances. The Board informed the Association that they were of opinion that if another ambulance were provided in the Distric t, it should be placed at the junction of the East and West India Dock Roads. FIRE ALARMS AND FIRE ESCAPES. In February a letter was received from the London County Council with a list of the j>ositions of Eire Alarmsand Eire Escapes in the District, and pointing out the advantage of the information being made public by means of tablets in or upon the street lamps or otherwise. In reply the Council was informed that the Board did not object to tablets being affixed as suggested, provided the work was carried out by and at the expense of the Council. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, CHARLES DUNCH, Surveyor of the Board. Medical officer Report for 1891 Meaning
