At the meeting of the Council on the 9th November, 1906, an election was held to fill three vacancies in the office of Alderman, caused by Aldermen retiring 23 by effluxion of time. Ten gentlemen were nominated for the positions, and the following were appointed for the term of six years:—Mr. William Pettingell Hunter, Mr. John Brennan Mulholland, and Major Raymond Henry Raymond Smythies. NUMBER OF MEETINGS HELD. The total number of meetings held during the year was as follows:- Council 25 Assessment Committee 16 Baths and Washhouses Committee 23 Cartage, Cemetery and Town Hall Committee 19 Electricity and Lighting Committee 24 Finance Committee 19 Joint and Special Committees 4 Law and Parliamentary Committee 21 Public Libraries Committee 20 Public Health Committee 20 Rating and Valuation Committee 24 Employes Sick Benefit Fund 4 Special Purposes Committee 19 Special Committee (Whole Council) 5 Works Committee 23 Sub-Committees 45 311 OFFICIAL STAFF. (a) Appointment of Solicitors. After mature consideration the Council, on 20th March, 1907, appointed Messrs. Watson, Sons & Room the Solicitors of the Council at the fixed remuneration of £500 per annum, to include all the legal and parliamentary work of the Council, with the exception of Parliamentary Agent's charges for the promotion of Bills, and of appeals to the House of Lords. An agreement was subsequently entered into for giving effect to this arrangement, which is subject to determination upon six months' notice being given 24 on either side. This work had previously been carried out by the firm named on the ordinary solicitor and client scale, and it is anticipated that by the new arrangement a considerable saving will be effected in the legal and parliamentary costs of the Council. (b) Town Clerk's Department. It is with regret that the Council records the death on the 6th December, 1906, of Mr. J. H. Boarder, a Senior Assistant in the Town Clerk's (general) office, who had completed six years in the service of the Council. The Council did not fill up this vacancy, but on the 20th February, 1907, appointed a junior Clerk in the person of Mr. Thomas Henry Beavins, at a salary of £50 per annum. On the 23rd January, 1907, the Council accepted the resignation of Mr. J. K. Ward, third assistant clerk in the Rating branch of the Town Clerk's office, who had been continuously employed since July, 1886, and who resigned his appointment by reason of old age and failing health; and on the 20th February granted him a superannuation. The vacancy created by Mr. Ward's resignation was filled by the appointment, on the 6th March, of Mr. Edward William Francis at a salary of £90, rising by £5 per annum to £130 per annum. (b) Public Health Department. The Council having decided to increase the number of samples of foods and drugs to be analysed under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, from 400 to 600 per annum, arranged with the Public Analyst to undertake this extra work at an increased remuneration of £100 per annum, thereby making his salary £300 Per annum. 25 The collection of the additional number of samples for analysis added considerably to the duties of Sanitary Inspector Oatley, and it was found necessary to provide him with assistance in the supervision of the collection of dust. His salary was at the same time, with the sanction of the Local Government Board, re-allocated as follows:—£110 to his duties under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, instead of £70; and £90 to his duties connected with the removal of house and trade refuse. By this arrangement the London County Council's contribution towards his salary will be increased from £35 to £55 per annum. (c) Borough Surveyor's Department. On the 12th March, 1907, Mr. E. W. Ludford, after 7½ years service, resigned his position as draughtsman in the Borough Surveyor's office, he having obtained another appointment. The appointment has not been filled up. (d) Electricity Department. On the 4th April, 1906, the salary of Mr. Frank Hill, Chief Assistant Engineer, was increased from £325 to £350, and that of Mr. R. H. Patterson, Station Superintendent, from £250 to £300 per annum, and small increases have been made in the salaries of the electricians, clerks, and other employees of the Electricity Department. SUPERANNUATION OF EMPLOYEES. Superannuation allowances have, during the year, been granted under the Superannuation (Metropolis) Act to the following officers and employees of the Council, who, by reason of old age, have become incapable of discharging their duties with efficiency: 26 Date Allowance Made.

There were 150 claims on the fund in respect of sickness; and claims for death allowances were made and paid in respect of the death of eight contributors and three contributors' wives. The receipts and payments were as follow: RECEIPTS. £ s. d.

These amendments include the reduction in the weekly sick pay from 12s. to 10s. during the first 13 weeks, and from 8s. to 7s. during the second 13 weeks, and the abolition of the payment of visiting stewards' fees. HIGHWAYS. a Street Improvements. I. King Street.—In addition to the properties mentioned in the last Annual Report as having been acquired for the widening of King Street, between Cambridge Road and Studland Street, the following further properties have been acquired for the same purpose:— Owner. Premises. Description of Interest. Price Paid. Mrs. Catherine Vine 98, King Street (Part required) Freehold £350 Messrs. Thompson and Jackson Ditto Leasehold £1500 Mr .Thomas Jenkins 116, King Street Ditto £1740 Ditto 120, ditto Ditto £1683 Mrs. Jane Fishbein 140 and part of 138 ditto Sub-leasehold £225 (Nos. 96 and 98, King Street.) Only so much of these properties as was actually required for the improvement having been purchased, the frontages of the premises have been set back and rebuilt, and the necessary widening of the street at that point has been effected. The alterations agreed upon at No. 96 have also been carried out, at the cost of the Council. 28 (Nos. 116 and 120, King Street.) These two premises were acquired subject to a rental of £125 at No. 116, and of £250 on No. 120. The Council not being in possession of the freehold, decided to let the premises until such time as they were in a position to set back the frontages. No. 116 has therefore been let on a yearly tenancy at a rental of £200 per annum for the first year, £225 per annum for the second year, and for the third and subsequent years, £250 per annum. The front portion of No. 120 has been let for one year certain at a rental of £250 per annum, but a tenant for the back portion of No. 120 has not yet been found. No. 140, King Street is subject to a rental, payable by the Council, of £85 per annum, at which rental the Council have let the premises on a quarterly tenancy. The Council has renewed its application to the London County Council for a contribution towards the cost of the improvement, but no definite reply to this has been received. 2. Broadway.—Reference was made in the last report to the negotiations pending for the acquisition of properties required for the Broadway improvement. Since then the purchase of Mr. Evan Crawfurd Piatt's freehold interest in Nos. 18 and 20, has been completed for the sum of £5750, and the leasehold interest in the former has been acquired for £150. In the case of No. 20, three quarters' rent, equivalent to £105, has been allowed as compensation to the fate tenant, the lease on which the premises were held having expired. No. 18 has been relet to the former tenant on a quarterly tenancy, at a rent of £100, and No. 20 has been let on a weekly tenancy at a rent after the rate of £160 per annum, the rates and taxes in both cases being paid by the Council. 3. Brook Green Road.—All the properties in Brook Green Road required for this improvement have been acquired, and the houses have been demolished and the site cleared, and the frontage line has been set back for the widening. The Council is now negotiating with the London County Council as to the amount to be paid by the latter for the strip of land required for the improvement. 29 The Council has let to Messrs. Pascalls, Limited, for one year the right to erect advertising hoarding on the frontage of the land at a rental of £160. 4. Fulham Palace Road.— The Council has agreed to contribute one third of the net cost, estimated at £1,470, towards the expense which the London County Council propose to incur in acquiring about 1,180 superficial feet of ground in Fulham Palace Road, at and near the buildings of the Guinness' Trust, for the purpose of widening the road at that point. In connection with this improvement the Council has agreed to give up 74 square feet of the frontage to the private road leading to the Coroner's Court, in consideration of the payment by the County Council of the sum of £50 to include the cost of re-erecting the entrance gates at the new frontage line. 5. Scrubs Lane.— The London County Council has, on the request of the Borough Council, agreed to increase its promised contribution towards the cost of the reconstruction and widening of the bridge, carrying Scrubs Lane over the Great Western Railway loop line, from £200 to two thirds of the net cost of the improvement, on the understanding that if such cost exceeds £681 95. od. its total contribution will be limited to £455. In connection with the general widening of Scrubs Lane, which the London County Council is undertaking under the London County Council (Tramways and Improvements) Act, 1903, the County Council had up to the 31st March expended the sum of £14.487 17s. od., of which the Borough Council has to contribute one third. 6. Proposed Road to connect Wood Lane and Latimer Road.—The London County Council has given its statutory consent to the formation by the Borough Council of the proposed road from Wood Lane to Latimer Road at the point agreed upon with the Great Western Railway Company. Before deciding to proceed with the improvement, which is estimated to cost £22,500, the Borough Council is endeavouring to secure substantial contributions to the cost thereof from the London County Council and the Kensington Borough Council. (b) Street Nomenclature. Orders have been made by the London County Council for the alteration in the naming of streets and numbering of premises as follow, viz.:— 30 Date of Order. Particulars of Alterations. 1906. 13 th March Uxbridge Road (North side), subsidiary names abolished and houses re-numbered. 3rd July Queen's Road re-named Crisp Road. 31st July Henry Place and Beaumont Street re-named Boxmoor Street, and houses re-numbered. 1907. 12th February Richford Street (in part) re-named Astrop Terrace. Ditto Wharton Road re-named Rayleigh Road. (c) Tramways from Queen Street to Putney. Reference was made in the last report to the action taken by the Council in endeavouring to obtain an alteration of the decision of the London County Council to use granite sets as the material for paving between the rails of the proposed tramway between Queen Street and Putney. In furtherance of this object a joint deputation from the Fulham Borough Council and this Council attended before the Highways Committee of the London County Council on 12th July, 1906, and strongly urged the objections to the proposal, but were unsuccessful in inducing that Committee to alter its decision. On the 29th January, 1907, the Highways Committee submitted to the London County Council proposals for carrying out the construction of this tramway and of that between the Broadway and Harlesden. and, after a meeting of representatives of the two Borough Councils on the subject, strong letters of protest were again addressed to the County Council, which referred the matter back to the Highways Committee, and the matter since then has remained in abeyance. PARLIAMENTARY. The following Acts and Parliamentary Bills have received consideration during the year:— 1. Hammersmith City and North East London Railway Bill, 1906. Mention was made in the last report of the proposals contained in this Bill for constructing an underground railway, commencing in Chiswick and proceeding via King 31 Street, the Broadway, and Hammersmith Road to the City and North-East London, and for acquiring lands in Hammersmith for a generating station. The House of Commons on the 4th July suspended for that Session the proceedings upon the Bill, with liberty to the promotors to proceed with the Bill in the next Session at the stage at which it was suspended. The promotors gave notice to the Council on the 30th January, 1907, that they had decided not to avail themselves of this suspension, but to drop the Bill for the time being. 2. Electric Power Bills. The several Electricity Bills introduced in the Session of 1906, referred to in the last report, came before a Select Committee of the House of Commons which, after hearing the evidence for and against the London County Council Bill, issued a special report, in which it expressed the opinion that the best means of providing for the supply of electrical energy, in bulk, and for power and motive purposes, was by one large and comprehensive scheme extending not only over the entire county of London, but also to adjoining boroughs and districts, and that the authority for carrying out such scheme should be the London County Council; and that, pending the introduction of a satisfactory Bill in the next Session by the London County Council, or, in default of that body, then by some competent body of promoters, it was not advisable that any further progress should be made with any of the Bills. Four Bills have been introduced into Parliament in the Session of 1907, for powers to supply electrical energy in London, viz.:— (a) London County Council (Electric Supply) Bill.—Proposal to enable the Council to supply electrical energy in London and certain surrounding districts, and to empower the Council to acquire the undertakings of local authorities in the County of London, and the undertakings of companies within the proposed area of supply. (b) Administrative County of London and District Electric Power Bill.— Proposal to enable the undertakers and the London County Council to enter into an agreement for the purpose of generating and supplying electrical energy within the area of supply above referred to. 32 (c) London and District Electric Power Bill.— Proposal to enable the undertakers to supply energy to authorised undertakers and for providing power to any person within the limits of supply, including the County of London and certain boroughs and districts in Middlesex, Surrey, Essex and Kent. (d) London Electric Supply Bill.— Promoted by the fourteen Electric Light Companies having power for the supply of electrical energy in the County of London and adjoining districts, for the purpose of enabling them to establish a joint Committee to take over and arrange any generating stations of the London Companies, and to supply energy to all or any of the Companies or to any authorised distributor, including any local authority. The London and District Electric Power Bill was withdrawn by the promoters, and the Borough Council presented petitions to the House of Commons in opposition to the London County Council (Electric Supply) Bill, and the London Electric Supply Bill. The Bills were under consideration at the close of the year. 3. Burials Act, 1906. Arising out of an important decision affecting burial grounds (Godden v. Hythe Burial Board) in which the Burial Authority was restrained from using for any burial or burials, any part of its new burial ground, within the distance of 100 yards from any of the plaintiffs dwellinghouses at Hythe, a conference of Burial Authorities was held, at which the Council was represented, when a resolution was passed, expressing the opinion that the state of the law, as decided in the above case, was most unsatisfactory, and against the public interest, and that it was expedient to immediately amend Section 9 of the Burials Act, 1855. This resolution was conveyed by deputation to the Home Secretary and the President of the Local Government Board, and as the result of the representations made, the latter introduced a Bill to give effect to the desired amendment, which duly passed and received the Royal Assent on 21st December, 1906. The amending provisions of the new Act are to the effect that the consent of the owner, lessee and occupier of a dwelling house to the use for burials of any ground used or appropriated for a Cemetery, mentioned in Section 9 of the Burials Act, 1855, shall not be and shall be deemed never to have been required in any case where the dwelling house is or was begun to be erected after any part of that ground was or had been so used or appropriated. 33 4. Prevention of Corruption Act, 1906. A Bill to provide for the punishment of corrupt transactions with agents, which includes a person serving under the crown, or under any corporation, or any municipal borough, county or district council, or any board of guardians, was introduced in the session of 1906, and duly passed, obtaining the Royal Assent on 4th August, 1906. 5. Central London Railway Bill, 1907. This Bill was promoted by the Central London Railway Company, to obtain power to construct a short length of railway, formed by a junction with the existing railway eastward of Caxton Road, and passing along Uxbridge Road, as far as Wood Lane, and terminating about 100 yards north of Uxbridge Road in the Company's land adjacent to Wood Lane. The promoters having agreed to insert a clause in the Bill for the protection of the interests of the Borough Council, it was decided to offer no opposition to the Bill. The terms of the clause have been agreed between the Council and the Company. 6. London and North Western Railway Bill, 1907. This Bill included a proposal to construct a double line of railway between Euston and Watford, adjoining the Company's main line, involving the taking of additional lands, etc.. between the points named, including certain premises in Harrow Road, Waldo Road, and Scrubs Lane, in the Borough. The promoters having agreed to insert in the Bill a clause for the protection of the interests of the Borough Council, the Council decided not to offer any opposition to the Bill. The terms of the clause have been agreed between the Council and the Company. 7. London United Tramways Bill, 1907. This Bill included a proposal to make a subway for foot passengers, commencing in the approach to the Hammersmith and City Railway Station in Beadon Road, and terminating at the northern end of the up platform of the Metropolitan District Railway Company's Station at Hammersmith. A petition was lodged by the Council in opposition to the proposal, and the Company was approached with a view to clauses being agreed for the protection of the Borough Council's interests. Owing however, to the oppositions to the proposal, the Company ultimately withdrew the provisions relating to that part of the Bill. 34 8. Metropolitan Water Board (Charges) Bill. This Bill was promoted by the Metropolitan Water Board in pursuance of the requirement of the Metropolis Water Act, 1902, that the Board shall, within three years after the appointed day, viz. : 24th June, 1904, introduce into Parliament a Bill providing for uniform scales of charges, applicable throughout their limits of supply. The rates which the Water Board is now entitled to charge for domestic purposes vary in the several water areas under its control, from as high as 7½ per cent. to as low as 3 per cent. on the annual value of houses, so that the consumers in certain districts would reap a considerable advantage by the proposed equalisation of the charge, whereas those in other districts where the present rate is low would suffer by having their rates materially increased. The Hammersmith Borough comes within the latter category. Here the present rate of charge is 4 per cent. on houses of an annual value of not exceeding £200, and 3 per cent. on houses above that value. In addition there are certain extra charges for high service and closets and baths. The Bill proposes to abolish these additional charges, which will to some extent compensate for the increase in the rate, but as, generally speaking, the proposed alteration would cause a substantial increase in the amount of water rate to be paid by the ratepayers of the Borough, the Council presented a petition in opposition to the Bill, which is also being opposed by other Councils whose districts are similarly affected. The Bill was referred to a Joint Committee of the two Houses of Parliament for consideration. 9. Workmen's Compensation Act, 1906. A Bill was introduced in the Session of 1906 to consolidate and amend the law with respect to compensation to workmen for injuries sustained in the course of their employment. The Bill duly passed and obtained the Royal Assent on the 21st December, 1906, under the title of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1906. Under this Act the liability of the Council in respect to accidents to its employees is increased, so as to include persons not hitherto entitled to compensation whose employment (for the purposes of the Council's business) is of a casual nature, and persons employed otherwise than by way of manual labour (i.e., clerical staff, etc.) and whose remuneration does not exceed £250 per annum. The Act comes into operation on the 1st July, 1907, and the Council is arranging to increase its insurance against liability for accident to its employees under the Act. 35 OPPOSITION TO NEW LICENCES. Notices of intended application to the Kensington Bench of Justices for new licences for the sale of intoxicating liquors at the undermentioned places in the borough, having been received, the Council decided to offer no objection to Mr. Gilbert's application, and to oppose the applications of Mr. H. F. Fuller, and Mr. W. D. Prince. In the case of Mr. Klempner's application, it was decided to request the Justices, in the event of their granting the application, to require Mr. Klempner to give an undertaking not to have a bar, and to confine the sale of intoxicating liquors to persons who at the same time were being supplied with food. The Justices refused both the applications opposed by the Council, and granted the other applications, Mr. Klempner giving the required undertaking: Premises. Nature of Licence. Proposed Licensee. Premises and grounds connected therewith to be known as thelndian Court of the Franco- British Exhibition and Entertainment Buildings about to be erected on a site between Uxbridge Road on the south, Ducane road on the north, Old Oak Road on the west, and the West London Extension Railway and Wood Lane on the east. *Premises about to be constructed on a site at the corner of Larden Road and Mandel road, and intended to be known as "The Three Tuns."

The Council has been approached by the Justices acting for the Kensington Division, as to whether in the opinion of the Council, there were any licensed premises in the Borough which were unnecessary for the needs of the neighbourhood, with a view to their being referred to the Quarter Sessions for refusal, subject to compensation. The Justices stated that they considered that there were many facts which must come to the notice of the Council in the. assessment and rating of premises, tending to bear out the contention that certain licenses were unnecessary. The matter was most carefully considered, and ultimately the Justices were informed (a) that the Council did not feel at liberty to use any facts which came to its notice in the assessment and rating of licensed premises, in support of any contention that certain licenses were unnecessary, as such facts were given in confidence; and (b) that the Council was of opinion that there were too many licensed houses in certain areas in the Borough, and considered that the Licensed Victuallers should be consulted as to which of such licenses should be discontinued under the provisions of the Licensing Act, 1904. 37 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. During the year 51 summonses have been taken out under the various Acts administered by the Council as follows:- Enactment. Summonses heard. Decided in Council's favour. Fines and costs inflicted. Amount recovered. Remarks. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. £ s. d. £ S. d. One case dismissed on ground that the wrong person was summoned. Adulteration of Butter 9 8 17 17 6 17 17 6 Do.

Metropolis Local Management Acts: Recovery of Paving Charges 3 3 0 3 0 0 3 0 Electric Lighting Order: Recovery of charges for Electricity consumed 2 2 0 3 0 0 3 0 In each case the charges were recovered. Larceny Act: Stealing ribbons from graves 2 1 0 10 0 — Fines payable to Police. One case dismissed on account of the defendant's youth Criminal Law Amendment Act. 12 11 103 10 0 6 0 0 Fines payable to Police Four of the defendants were sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine, and in five cases the fines not being forthcoming, defendants went to prison for terms varying from two to three months. Total 51 40 149 18 0 51 18 0 38 The attention of the Local Government Board, and the Board of Agriculture, has been directed to the abortive proceedings in the four cases of milk adulteration owing to the written warranty defence, and they have been urged to promote legislation for the amendment of the present unsatisfactory state of the law with regard to milk warranties. PUBLIC HEALTH. (a) By-laws for the regulation of Offensive Businesses. The Borough Council on the 20th February, 1907, approved of the proposal of the London County Council to make by-laws to regulate certain offensive businesses, comprising those of Knacker; Manure manfacturer, and Tallow Melter; Bone Boiler; Soap Boiler; Cat-gut maker; Fat Melter; Glue and Size manufacturer; Tripe Boiler; Dresser of Fish Skins; and Fellmonger. The London County Council duly made the by-laws on the 26th February, 1907. (b) Tinned and Preserved Foods. The Council has, in conjunction with other authorities, communicated with the Local Government Board, in favour of the introduction of legislation to secure better protection for the public in regard to tinned and preserved foods, with power to the Sanitary authorities to enter and institute legal proceedings in respect of factories and other places where food is prepared, similar to the powers now possessed by the Home Office Inspectors. (c) Adulteration of Butter. The President of the Board of Agriculture having announced his intention of appointing a Committee to investigate the question of the Adulteration of Butter, the Borough Council has, in conjunction with other Authorities, represented to him that the scope of the inquiry might with advantage be enlarged so as to comprehend the questions of the limits of Warranties, the use of Preservatives, and the result of the use by traders of notices to the effect that no guarantee of purity is given, and the ways in which the intention of the Food and Drugs Act is, in many cases, defeated. 39 FINANCE. (a) Audit of Accounts. The accounts of the Borough Council for the year ended 31st March, 1907, have been audited by Mr. A. Carson Roberts, the District Auditor, and are published separately. The Auditor's report thereon is as follows:— Metropolitan Boroughs Audit District. District Auditor's Report. The Grove, Dulwich, S.E. 7th August, 1907. To the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith. Gentlemen, I beg to report that 1 have closed the Audit of the Accounts of the Council for the year ended at the 31st day of March last, Expenditure. The following items have been covered for this occasion by sanctions under the Local Authorities (Expenses) Act, 1887:— £ s. d. Salary of Public Health Visitor (maternity cases) 85 10 8 Printing, etc., re cases of infant life 11 6 0 Post Mortem Instruments (a County not a Borough charge) 1 9 6 Subscriptions to the Metropolitan Borough Council's Association 10 10 0 Gratuities to widows of employees 17 8 4 In giving their sanction to the last item the Local Government Board state that they could not undertake to sanction future payments of the kind. Electricity Accounts. Excepting in regard to the two matters which are mentioned below, the accounts present a correct and reliable basis for considering the financial position and the results of the working of the undertaking, i. There has been some delay in the raising of Loans to meet the capital outlay, and as a result the incidence of the loan redemption charges proper to the years had been 40 to some extent deferred. It has been arranged that, if any unavoidable delays do arise in regard to future borrowings, provision shall be made by setting aside a special reserve sufficient to compensate or prevent any postponement of the redemption contributions. ii. The share of general salary and establishment charges apportioned to the Electric Revenue Account is in my opinion too small, and should be subjected to review by the Council, or by the Finance Committee. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) A. CARSON ROBERTS, District Auditor. (b) Estimates, 1907-8. The following is a summary of the estimates, prepared by the Finance Committee and adopted by the Council, of the sums required for the various purposes of the Council during the year ending 31st March, 1908:- Expenditure.

This resolution was communicated to the Presidents of the Local Government Hoard and the Hoard of Trade, the Chairman of the London County Council, and to the Metropolitan City and Horough Councils. Fares on the Metropolitan District Railway. The attention of the Borough Council having been directed to the action of the Metropolitan District Railway Company in increasing the fares charged to workmen and other passengers 011 that railway, a representation was made to the Board of Trade thereon, who replied 011 the 13th October, 1906, to the effect that they had been informed by the London County Council, that that Council had written to the Company urging a reduction in the workmen's fares,and that failing a satisfactory settlement, the Committee of the Council dealing with the question, proposed to recommend the Council to make representations to the Board in the matter, in order that it might be dealt with under the provisions of the Cheap Trains Act, 1883. Cab Fares. The Council and its predecessors have on several occasions made representations to the Home Secretary in favour of the Cab Radius being extended, but without success. In the Session of 1906, a Bill was introduced into the House of Commons, entitled the Cabs and Omnibuses (Metropolis) Bill, and referred to a Select Committee to inquire into, amongst other questions, the scale of fares, and particularly the question of the extension of the four-mile radius. The Select Committee, having gone very fully into the matter, submitted a report to the House on 4th August, 1906, in which they reported adversely upon the proposal, and suggested as a remedy for the dissatisfaction now felt, a simple re-adjustment of fares. Labour for Unemployed. A deputation of unemployed workmen attended before the Council on 28th January, 1907, and submitted suggestions for providing work for the unemployed. The suggestions were referred to the Works Committee, who reported thereon as follows :— 56 Suggestions. Committee's Observations.

To erert dwellings for the The L.C.C hav e acquired a site in Old Oak Road, working classes in the borough, for the erection thereon of men's dwellings on an extensive scale. Having regard to that fact, and to the fact that there is a large number of unoccupied houses in the borough, we do not consider that there is anv need for the Council to undertake the erection of working-clas^ dwellings at the present time. To provide shelter for We have referred this matter to the Public Health use of persons while Committee for consideration, their premises are being disinfected. To reduce hours of labour At the pre» nt time the hours per week of the road of road sweepers to 48 sweepers an : Summer 56½, Winter 53; to hours per week so as to reduce the hours as suggested without a corresprovide employment for ponding reduction in wages would involve eman additional number plowing ten additional men per week at an of men. estimated extra annual cost in wages of about £550. We see no good reason for making the proposed alteration To insert a clause in all We consider that the insertion of a clause, as contracts requiring consuggested, in the Council's contracts would be tractors to employ men prejudicial to tin interests of Hammersmith resident in the borough working men. Where possible arrangements are made with the contractors for Rorough Council works to employ local men as far as possible, and recently the contractors for the construction of Larden Road and Eynham Road have consented to adopt this course. Unemployed (Workmen) Act, 1906. The Distress Committee appointed by the Borough Council, under the Unemployed (Workmen) Act, has continued its 57 operations during the past year, a report of its proceedings being appended. Upon the application of the Central (Unemployed) Body, the Council on the nth July, 1906, transferred to that body under the provisions of the Act, the labour bureau which the Council had established under the Labour Bureau (London) Act. Mr. James Hampson, the Superintendent thereof, was, at the same time, taken over by the Central Body. The bureau is now known as the Employment Exchange. Subsequently the Council, on the request of the Central Body, nominated five members to serve on the local Advisory Committee of the Exchange. Nuisances from Motor Vehicles. The attention of the Borough Council having been directed to the serious nuisances occasioned to residents in the Borough, more particularly to those whose premises front the main thoroughfares, by the noise, smoke, smell and oil emitted from motor vehicles, the Council made urgent representations to the Commissioner of Police thereon; and was represented at a conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils, at which a series of resolutions was passed which were submitted to the Home Secretary, the President of the Local Government Board, and the Commissioner of Police, urging the desirability of early effect being given to such resolutions, by legislation or otherwise. It is understood that these Authorities are giving the matter careful consideration. Combined Drainage. The Council, on 30th May, 1907, concurred in a resolution passed at a conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils, convened by the Fulham Borough Council, upon the subject of combined drainage, urging the President of the Local Government Board to give the subject of the unsatisfactory state of the law relating to combined drainage in London his serious consideration, with the view of a Bill to amend the law being introduced into Parliament at an early date. This resolution was embodied in the form of a joint memorial to the President of the Local Government Board, to which the seals of the Borough Councils represented at the conference were affixed, and the memorial was duly presented by a deputation. The Local Government Board wrote to the Town Clerk of Fulham on 20th November, 1906, stating that they were not in a position to promise to introduce legislation on the subject, at present. Further efforts are, however, being made to induce the Board to take the matter up. 58 Population.

Plans, specifications, estimates and apportionments have been prepared and presented to the Council for making up and taking over the following private roads, viz.:— Plan No. Road. 105 Aldbourne Road (Sect. I) 106 Askham Road 107 Flanchford Road 108 Larden Road 109 Dunraven Road (Sect. I.) 111 Eynham Road (Sect. I.) 112 Thorpebank Road 113 Dunraven Road (Sect. II.) 113 Adelaide Road (Sect. III.) "4 Halsbury Road (Sect. III.) "5 Nascot Street US Glenroy Street 1 r5 Caverswell Street 116 Wilton Road (west footpath) The road making and paving works having been completed in the following roads at the cost of the owners of property abutting on them, they are now repairable by the Council:— Plan No. Road. Cost. £ s. d. 103 Collingbourne Road 733 19 0 103 Halsbury Road (Sect. II.) 252 8 2 104 Osman Road (Sect. II.) 113 16 9 105 Aldbourne Road (Sect. I.) 459 17 0 106 Askham Road 253 7 4 107 Flanchford Road 751 13 2 78 PAVING WEST SIDE WILTON ROAD. This matter has received the attention of the Borough Council. Some years ago, the late Vestry paved and made up the footpath on the east side of Wilton Road, and also the carriageway. Of the cost of this work £149 remained outstanding. This amount was chargeable to the owners of the property abutting on the west side, but it could not be apportioned on them, as their frontage was outside the Borough boundary. As it was desirable that the west footpath should be made up and paved, the Urban District Council of Acton approached the Borough Council, and offered to pay the above outstanding sum of £149, and also to collect the amounts apportioned on the frontagers for paving the west side, if the Borough Council would then carry out the work. This course has been adopted, and the work will be shortly put in hand. SWEEPING OF ROADS. In accordance with a reference from the Borough Council as to whether the roads swept weekly could be done so more frequently, the Borough Surveyor prepared a report upon the matter, in which it was stated that the Borough is divided into twelve districts, radiating from the main wood-paved roads. The wood-paved roads are swept daily, 31 men being individually allotted to certain sections of the roadway, footpath and crossings of such roads. Sixtyseven men are engaged on the twelve cleansing districts in separate gangs of five or six men under a ganger, the size of gang being regulated by the length of roadway allotted. The more important roads other than wood-paved, are, under ordinary conditions, swept two or three times each week, and the roads with the least traffic are swept once a week, the horse brooms being used on all side streets when the weather makes this necessary. 79 The Council came to the conclusion, that they would not be justified in incurring the additional expense that would be involved, in sweeping the roads more often than under the present system. STREET IMPROVEMENTS. (1) King Street. No. 96.—In compliance with the leaseholder's terms upon which the portion of the above premises required for widening the street were acquired, the Borough Surveyor prepared drawings shewing the alterations and additions necessitated by setting back the front of the premises, and which were approved of by the Borough Council. Tenders were invited for carrying out the work, and that of Messrs. A. E. Denby & Co., of Bristol, in the sum of £395 was accepted. This work has been completed. No. 98.—After the Borough Council had decided to appeal against the decision of Mr. Justice Buckley in the action brought by Messrs. Thompson & Jackson, the leaseholders of the premises, to restrain the Borough Council from acting upon its notice to acquire a portion only of the premises for widening King Street, Messrs. Thompson & Jackson intimated that taking into consideration that the Council had bought the front portion of the adjoing premises and for other reasons, they would be prepared to waive their right to demand the whole of the premises being taken. Acting upon this, negotiations were opened and terms were eventually settled for the purchase of the leasehold interest in the strip required for widening the street. Following upon the acquisition of the leasehold interest, negotiations were entered into with the representatives of the freeholder for the purchase of that interest. Terms have been settled and the matter completed. The front part of the premises has been pulled down and a new front erected to the improved line. No. 116.—After considerable negotiations, terms were arranged for the purchase of Mr. T. G. Jenkin's leasehold, of which 14 years were unexpired, and also his trade interest in this property. An offer was received from Messrs. Overton & Goudie, the managers of Mr. Jenkin's business, offering to become the tenants of these premises. The Council decided to let the premises to them for one year certain, and afterwards, should the tenancy be extended, as quarterly tenants. 80 No. 120.—The leasehold interest of about 16 years unexpired in this property with the buildings at the rear have been acquired with vacant possession. The Council has let the shop part of these premises on a quarterly tenancy to Messrs. Hill & Co., for the purpose of an auctioneer's and furniture dealer's business. No. 140.—The occupier and sub-lessee, Mrs. Fishbien, having intimated her willingness to dispose of her interest in these premises, the Borough Surveyor entered into negotiation with her, and terms were eventually agreed upon for the purchase of the unexpired portion of her lease, which amounted to about 6 years. The premises were re-let to Mrs. Fishbien on a quarterly tenancy, which was subsequently terminated, and the premises let on a similar agreement to Mr. H. Cope. (2) The Broadway. Nos. 18 and 20.—The freehold of these premises required for widening the Broadway for the proposed tramway to Harlesden, has been acquired, after extended negotiation with the representative of the owner. The leasehold interest in No. 18 has also been acquired and the premises have been let to the late leaseholder on a monthly tenancy. (3) Jeddo Road. Negotiations have been in progress for the acquisition of the land required for continuing this road into a new road to be constructed, to be called Willoughby Road. The proposal as reported last year necessitated the purchase of four building plots, two in Hammersmith and two in Acton. It was eventually agreed that the cost of the land required should be borne equally by the two Councils, and each should defray the cost of the roadmaking, paving and drainage works of the portion of the road within its district. The work of making up and paving the Hammersmith portion has been put in hand. (4) Brook Green Road. Notices to quit were served upon all the tenants of the premises acquired by the Council in this road, vacant possession being obtained of the property with the exception of No. 22a. 81 Owing to a difficulty with the tenant who subsequently showed he had a sub-lease, the original leaseholder was called upon by the Council to give vacant possession in accordance with the agreement entered into. It is hoped that the matter will be shortly settled by the Council obtaining possession. Tenders were invited for clearing the site situated between the Town Hall and the Carnegie Library, with the exception of No. 22a, and that of Messrs. W. A. Sabey & Co., was accepted who have carried out the work of pulling down the buildings and removing the materials. (5) Fulham Palace Road. The Borough Council has agreed to sell for £50 a part of the private road leading to the Coroner's Court, to widen Fulham Palace Road, for the proposed London County Council tramway to Putney. The above sum to include the cost of all reinstatement work, and which is to be undertaken by the Borough Council. (6) Communication between Halsbury Road and Bloemfontein Road. The trustees of the freeholder of the land on which Halsbury Road was formed, have arranged with the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for the purchase of the strip of land required for forming a means of communication between Halsbury Road and Bloemfontein Road. DEPÔT — SCRUBS LANE. A piece of land situated in Scrubs Lane, near the end of North Pole Road, has been purchased for the purpose of forming a depôt for storing material, and also a sub-station for the electricity undertaking. The plot has a frontage to Scrubs Lane of 140 feet, and a mean depth of about 300 feet. DISINFECTING APPARATUS. The disinfector at the Wharf, which was laid down in 1896, shewed signs of defect in May, and on further examination it was found that the casing had bulged externally at the part which comes over the firegrate, to about 1" in height, and 3"x5" on the 82 surface, upsetting the plates to the extent of about 18" and there was also a corresponding bulge in the interior of the machine, and some of the plates at the side of the apparatus had become eaten away. It was decided by the Council to accept the offer of Messrs. Goddard, Massey & Warner of Nottingham, the makers, to make a new steel casing, with new end frames, which practically amounted to a new machine for the sum of £94. In setting the new machine, it was considered advisable to dispense with the overtop flues, and to arrange for the gases of combustion to pass direct to the chimney, instead of as in the old machine, where the gases passed over the back side and over the top part of the disinfector. This arrangement would prevent the gases coming in contact with any of the disinfector plates above the normal water level. Hand-holes have been provided so that the unexposed parts of the apparatus may be examined at any time. The work has been completed and the machine is now in good order. TRAMWAY TERMINUS, UXBRIDGE ROAD. The Borough Council has had the question of regulating admission to the tramcars at this terminus under consideration, and a number of schemes to meet the difficulty were prepared by the Borough Surveyor, but it has not been found possible to carry out any of the schemes. TRAMWAY TRACKS. In consequence of complaints of the bad state of the tramway tracks, they were inspected by the Borough Surveyor, who submitted a report upon the condition of the same, with a schedule of defective places in the wood paving, maintainable by the Tramway Company. It was found on inspection, that many of the joints of the rails were defective, apparently caused by the giving way of the fish plates, and consequently when the cars pass over these places, the ends of the rails deflect and cause the noise which is a source of complaint. 83 The matter was laid before the Council, who directed that a notice should be served upon the Tramway Company, requiring them to put their tracks into a proper state of repair. ADDISON GARDENS BRIDGE. Part of the steelwork on the underside of this bridge, over the rails of the London and North Western Railway and London and South Western Railway, has been re-painted at a cost of £26. The bridge was last re-painted throughout in 1902. COAL PLATES. Observation is kept upon the condition of the coalplates on the public footpaths, and when any appear to be in a defective condition, a notice is served upon the owner thereof, requiring him to put the coalplate in a safe condition, together with which is forwarded a list of the charges for which the Borough Council will carry out the work. During the year twenty 12 inch and one 14 inch coalplates have been supplied and fixed for the owners. The following are the charges:— Price with Rim. Cutting hole in stone. Total. s. d. s. d. s. d. a. 12-in. plain or perforated plate 4 6 2 6 7 0 b. 14-in. plain or perforated plate 5 8 2 6 8 2 SEWERS. The length of main trunk sewers under the control of the London County Council, in the Borough, is 9 miles 7 furlongs 91 yards. The length of brick sewers under the jurisdiction of the Council is 11 miles 86 yards, and 25 miles 2 furlongs 41 yards of pipe sewers, the total being:— Miles. 20 Brick Fur. 7 Yds. 177 Miles. 25 Pipe. Fur. 2 Yds. 41 Miles. 45 Total. Fur. 9 Yds. 218 84 The sewers in the following roads have been re-laid, or partly re-laid, during the year, at the cost shewn:— £ s. d. Astrop Mews 11 2 4 Askew Road 19 2 3 Brackenbury Road 18 12 2 Benbow Road 8 4 5 Scotts Road 73 7 5 SEWER—MARDALE STREET. It has been necessary to consider the question of providing a new sewer to receive the drainage of the Baths and Wash-houses in Lime Grove. The Borough Surveyor submitted the following report upon the question:— "I have considered the question of the sewer outlet from the new Baths and Wash-houses, and have prepared plan and section shewing the levels. The level of the inverts of the sewers above Ordnance datum are:—Lime Grove 11.72; Mardale Street 9.28; the water level of the Baths 18.50, the bottom of the Baths 12.25, and the level of the lowest basement in Mardale Street is 13.08. It would therefore be possible to connect the outlets from the Baths with the sewer in Mardale Street, but for the liability to flood the basements of the houses during the emptying of the Baths. In addition, the sewers in Mardale Street and Lime Grove are both 12in. in diameter, and a larger outlet sewer is required to allow of the proper emptying of the Baths. It has therefore been found necessary to construct a new 18 in. stone-ware pipe sewer down Mardale Street and connect it direct into the main sewer in Goldhawk Road, and to continue it westwards along Scotts Road for a distance of about 100 feet in order to drain the second-class bath. The outlet from the baths is connected to the sewer by means of tumbling bays, to reduce the pressure of the water as much as possible. The gradient of the sewer is 1 in 350. The connection to the Goldhawk Road sewer is by means of a bell mouth and manhole. The total estimated cost is £850." The work is now in progress. 85 SEWER—SCOTTS ROAD. The question of providing an outlet for the drainage of part of the Technical Institute in Lime Grove has been considered, and the following report was submitted:— "I have been in communication with the London County Council with respect to the provision of an outlet for the drainage of the Technical Institute. Owing to the level of the sewers in Lime Grove and Devonport Road, it is not possible to drain the whole of the premises into one sewer, and as there is not a sewer in Scotts Road, it will be necessary to lay one from the entrance to the Technical Institute in Scotts Road into the sewer in Devonport Road. This will provide the necessary outlet for the drainage of the western end of the Institute and also provide accommodation for the surface drainage of Scotts Road on behalf of the Borough Council. The estimated cost of constructing the sewer is £72, and a letter has been received from the London County Council, stating that they are prepared to defray a moiety (£36) of the cost, on the Borough Council undertaking to contribute a similar moiety of £36. I therefore suggest that the Committee agree to the terms proposed." The Council decided that the sewer should be constructed as proposed, the cost to be borne equally by the London County Council and the Borough Council. SEWER—DEVONPORT ROAD. The Borough Surveyor submitted the following report upon this matter:— "The London County Council in constructing the new relief sewer in Devonport Road, have found that their sewer cuts through the house drains from Nos. 75 to 93, and they suggest that a new 12in. pipe sewer should be laid alongside their relief sewer on the west side of the road to take the drainage of these houses. The new 12in. sewer would then be connected to the relief sewer. "The level of this new proposed 12in. sewer would be practically the same as the existing sewer which, at the present time, takes the drainage of these houses, and therefore the gradients of the house connections would not be altered to any extent (the gradient would, really, be somewhat improved). There are only four of the houses, viz., 75, 77, 87 and 89, which have basements, and the lowest of these is 14.70 above ordnance datum, whilst the level of the proposed 4ft. brick sewer, 86 belonging to the London County Council, is 7.78. The level of the sewage in the brick sewer would therefore have to rise 7 feet above the invert before any of these basements could be flooded, but the London County Council do not anticipate that this new sewer will ever be surcharged to anything like this extent. The new 4ft. 0in. brick relief sewer in the Devonport Road is connected flush with the invert of the sewer in Uxbridge Road, and will take the sewage from the Uxbridge Road west of Devonport Road, so that the possibility of these basements being flooded should be somewhat lessened. The whole cost of the proposal will be borne by the London County Council." The work has been carried out and completed by the London County Council. SEWER VENTILATORS. The following is a list of sewer ventilators with their positions. In these cases they are connected to the sewer in the road, carried up and attached to the wall of a building adjoining. position type of shaft.

Six additional stoneware gullies have been fixed and the connections made to the sewers in the various private streets taken over by the Council. Twentyfour have been fixed by the Council in several roads where new channel has been laid, and also where it has been found difficult to drain the water when relaying the channelling. The gullies are cleansed regularly in the summer once every month and flushed with water, and in winter, once every six weeks. Three horses and carts with men, have been employed 304 days removing 2,682 loads of soil. In dry weather during the summer, two water carts are employed filling the gullies with water mixed with disinfectant. MANHOLES. Seven new manholes have been built, and one new one has been built in one of the new streets taken over by the Council. Thirty-six sheet-iron plates have been fixed under manhole covers, where complaints have been received as to sewer emanations. FLUSHING. Two men have been out on nineteen days with the flushing van, and during that time discharged 175 loads of water into the sewer. The van contains 1,000 gallons of water when full. PRIVATE DRAINS. In accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Management Act, 18 and 19 Vict., cap. 120, sec. 76, and with the Council's regulations, 197 applications and plans have been submitted, and approved by the Works Committee, and subsequently sanctioned by 88 the Council for the drainage of 331 houses and shops, 9 factories, 7 schools, 6 stables, 2 churches, 2 blocks of flats, 1 railway station, 1 exhibition ground, and 1 disinfecting station. The drains are laid in accordance with the deposited plan, and in every case the Drainage Inspector tests the pipes before they are covered in. During the year, the Council's workmen have laid and connected 97 drains to the sewers and unstopped 10 drains, at the expense of the owners of the premises to which the drain belongs. The amount deposited to meet the cost of same was £816 5s. 0d., paid in from time to time to the Borough Accountant, and with the balance left in hand on the 31st March, 1906, viz., £127 0s. 3d., amounted to £943 5s. 3d. The actual cost of the work carried out was £759 19s. 5d., the surplus amounting to £126 17s. 10d., which, after being reported to the Finance Committee, was returned to the respective depositors, leaving a balance of £56 8s. 0d., being mostly in respect of uncompleted works. ROAD WATERING. The amount of water used for this purpose was 27,163,000 gallons, and cost £784 1s. 6d., this quantity was distributed by 62,069 separate van loads in 184 days. The average quantity held by each van is 412 gallons when full. The water is measured by meter at the standposts, of which there are 50 within the Borough. The meters and standposts are rented from the Water Board at an annual charge of £2 2s. 0d. each. Owing to the dry summer, 4,515,000 more gallons of water were used than in the same period of 1905-6. 89 SANITARY CONVENIENCES.

ARRANGEMENTS IN THE EVENT OF A FALL OF SNOW. In the early part of the winter, application was made to the Thames Conservancy for permission, in the event of a downfall, to shoot clean snow in the River Thames at certain points, such permission being granted upon certain conditions. For the purpose of quickly and effectually clearing the streets after a snowstorm, the Borough is divided into 40 sub-districts, with a competent man selected from the ordinary staff of the Council in charge of a gang for 109 each sub-district, each ganger is furnished at the beginning of the winter with a list of instructions, and a schedule of the streets and parts of streets within the sub-districts under his control. Preparation is therefore made for carrying out the work simultaneously in all parts of the Borough. Heavy falls of snow occurred on the 26th and 29th December. All the men who applied for work were employed in clearing away the snow, these men being drafted into the sub-districts. Altogether 1,316 extra men were employed, and 2,044 loads of snow removed, the snowfall costing the Borough £374 12s. 7d. GAS. WATER. &c„ TRENCHES.

Annual Report of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH of the BOROUGH OF HAMMERSMITH For the Year 1906. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Hammersmith. March 25th, 1907. Gentlemen—I beg to present to you my Annual Report for last year. The Report will deal with the vital statistics, and with the Sanitary work carried out under the direction of your Council during the 52 weeks ending on December 29th, 1906. The statistical tables prescribed by the Local Government Board are added, as well as the several other tables that have been heretofore appended. The deaths of non-Residents have been deducted, and the deaths of Residents occurring in other parts of London have been added as heretofore. Deaths of persons occurring in institutions, receiving sick and infirm persons, have alone been regarded for the purpose of correction. 116 BIRTHS. During last year 3,020 births were registered in this Borough against 3,110 in the previous year. Making due allowance for the increase of the population, the number of births registered last year was 298 below the average number registered during the previous 10 years. On the population estimated up to the middle of the year, i.e., 120,679 inhabitants, the number of births registered was equal to an annual rate of 25.0 births per 1,000 persons living. The birthrate in London on the estimated population of London up to the middle of the year, i.e., 4,721,217 inhabitants, was equal to an annual rate of 26.6 births per 1,000 persons living. These figures are calculated upon the actual number of births registered in the Borough and in London. No distribution of the births of children whose parents lately resided elsewhere has been made. Last year, for the first time, the Registrar General has corrected the births by allotting them to the districts to which the mothers were said to belong. He gives the corrected births of Hammersmith as 3,112. I have no data at my disposal for so correcting the births in this Borough. DEATHS. During last year 1,591 deaths were registered in this Borough, against 1,419 in the previous year. Making due allowance for the increase of the population, the number of deaths registered in this Borough last year was 121 below the average number registered during the previous 10 years. Adding 355 deaths of Residents of this Borough, which took place in general hospitals and other public institutions in other Boroughs of London, in London County Lunatic Asylums and Metropolitan Imbecile Asylums, and deducting 173 deaths of non-Residents which occurred, 146 at the West London Hospital, 21 at Nazareth 117 House, and 6 at the Hammersmith Infirmary, the corrected number of deaths of Residents registered last year was 1,773. On the before-mentioned estimated population, the corrected number of deaths of Residents, registered last year was equal to an annual rate of 14.7 deaths per 1,000 persons living. The death-rate in London on the estimated population of London up to the middle of the year was equal to an annual rate of 15.1 deaths per 1,000 persons living. DEATHS OF INFANTS. The corrected number of deaths of Residents under one year of age registered last year was 433, against 414 in the previous year. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age registered last year was equal to 244 per 1,000 of the total deaths of Residents registered, and to 143 per 1,000 of the total registered births. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age in London last year was equal to 229 per 1,000 of the total deaths registered, and 130 per 1,000 of the total registered births. The mortality rate of infants under one year of age was, as compared with the total deaths of Residents registered, 15 per 1,000, and, as compared with the total births registered, 13 per 1,000 greater in this Borough than in London. The difference between the deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 births registered and the same deaths in London was due to the large number of deaths of infants that occurred from Summer diarrhœa. In the previous year the infantile mortality rate in this Borough was only 2 per 1,000 more than in London as compared with the total births registered. It is interesting to note that, notwithstanding the fact that your Council appointed a Lady Health Visitor with the object of lessening the infantile mortality, it has actually gone up 11 per 1,000 as compared with London. These facts rather tend to prove, as I advised you, that the 118 causes of infantile mortality are, to a very considerable extent, due to social conditions and are beyond the power of Sanitary Authorities to prevent. I am not of opinion that any practical good is achieved by the appointment of Lady Health Visitors. The following table on infantile mortality has been prepared by me in accordance with the direction of the Local Government Board. iig TABLE V. Infantile Mortality during the year 1906.

The corrected number of deaths of Residents at 60 years of age and upwards that were registered during last year was 542 against 497 in the previous year. These deaths last year were equal to 4.5 per 1,000 of total persons living, and 306 per 1,000 of the total deaths of Residents registered. The deaths registered of persons at 60 years of age and upwards in London last vear was equal to 4.5 per 1,000 of the total persons living, and 297 per 1,000 of the total deaths of London Residents registered. This death rate was, therefore, the same in this Borough as in London as compared with the total persons living, and 9 per 1,000 greater in this Borough than in London as compared with the total deaths registered. 122 TABLE I.

The deaths to be included in Column 12 are the number in Column 7, corrected by the subtraction of the number in Column 10 and the addition of the number in Column 11. By the term "Non-residents" is meant persons brought into the district on account of sickness or infirmity, and dying in public institutions there; and by the term "Residents" is meant persons who have been taken out of the district on account of sickness or infirmity, and have died in public institutions elsewhere. The "Public Institutions" to be taken into account for the purposes of these Tables are those into which persons are habitually received on account of sickness or infirmity, such as hospitals, workhouses and lunatic asylums. A list of the Institutions in respect of the deaths in which corrections have been made should be given on the back of this Table.

Block i may. if desired.be used for tha whole district; and blocks 2, 3, &c., for the several localities. In small districts without l^cognised divisions of known population this Table need not be filled up. (6) Deaths of residents occurring in public institutions beyond the district are to be included in sub-columns c of this Table, and those of nonresidents registered in public institutions in the district excluded. (See note on Table I. as to meaning of terms "resident" and "nonresident.") (c) Deaths of residents occurring in public institutions whether within or without the district, are to be allotted to the respective localities according to the addresses of the deceased. (d) Care should be taken that the gross totals of the several columns in this Table respectively equal the corresponding totals for the whole districts in Tables I. and IV thus, the totals of sub-columns a. 0, and c should agree with the figures for the year in the columns 2, 3, and 12, respectively, of Table I.: the gross total of the sub-columns c should agree with the total of column 2 in Table IV., and the gross total of sub-columns d with the total of column 3 in Table IV. 125 Table showing the Death-Rates from all Causes in the County of London, the City of London, and the Metropolitan Boroughs during the 52 Weeks of 1906, as calculated by the Registrar General.

They are also, in columns 9-11, to be included among the deaths in their respective "Localities" according to the previous addresses of deceased as given by the Registrars. Deaths of "Non-Residents" occurring in public institutions in the district are in like manner to be excluded from columns 2-8 and 9-11 of this Table. (b) See notes on Table I. as to the meaning of "Residents" and "Non-Residents," and as to the "Public Institutions" to be taken into account for the purposes of these Tables. The" Localities" in Table IV. should be the same as those in Tables II. and III. (c) All deaths occurring in public institutions situated within the district, whether of "Residents" or of "Non-Residents," are, in addition to be dealt with as in note (a), to be entered in the last column of Table IV. The total number in this column should equal the figures for the year in column 9, Table I. (d) The total deaths in the several "Localities" in columns 9-11 of Table IV. should equal those for the year in the same localities in Table II., sub-columns c. The total deaths at all ages in column 2 of Table IV. should equal the gross total of columns 9-11, and the figures for the year in column 12 of Table I. (e) Under the heading of " Diarrhœa" are to be included deaths certi- fied as due to epidemic diarrhœa, alone or in combination with some other cause of ill-defined nature; and also deaths certified as from Epidemic enteritis; Zymotic enteritis; Epidemic diarrhœa; Summer diarrhœa; Dysentery and dysenteric diarrhœa; Choleraic diarrhoea, cholera, cholera nostras (in the absence of Asiatic cholera). Under the heading of "Enteritis" are to be included those certified as from Gastro-enteritis, Muco-enteritis, and Gastric catarrh unless from information obtained by enquiry from the certifying practitioner or otherwise, the Medical Officer of Health should have reason for including such deaths, especially those of infants, under the specific term "Diarrhoea." Deaths from Diarrhoea secondary to some other well-defined disease should be included under the latter. Under the headings of "Cancer" and "Puerperual fever" should be included all registered deaths from causes comprised within these general terms. In recording the facts under the various headings of Tables I., II., III., and IV. attention has been given to the notes on the Tables. N. C. COLLIER, Medical Officer of Health. March 25th, 1907. 128 DEATHS FROM THE NINE PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The total number of deaths of Residents that were registered from the nine principal zymotic diseases was 271 against 210 in the previous year. The deaths of Residents last year from these diseases were equal to 153 per 1,000 of the total deaths of Residents registered, and were at the rate of 2.2 deaths per 1,000 persons living. The deaths from the nine principal zymotic diseases in the whole of London were equal to 127 per 1,000 of the total deaths registered, and were at the rate of 1.9 deaths per 1,000 persons living. These deaths were, therefore, as compared with the total deaths of Residents registered, 26 greater per 1,000 deaths registered in this Borough than in London, and as compared with the population o-3 per 1,000 greater in this Borough than in London. The large number of deaths from diarrhoea, 144 last year against only 89 in the previous year, was the cause of the deaths from zymotic diseases being in excess of the average for London. The following table shews the deaths of Residents registered from the nine principal zymotic diseases which occurred in the 10 years 1897 to 1906. YEAR. Small-Pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever.

There were, omitting phthisis, 882 cases reported as due to notifiable infectious diseases in this Borough against 776 in the previous year. The number of cases of phthisis voluntarily notified was 105. There were also reported 751 cases of infectious diseases that were not notifiable, against 922 in the previous year, 68 of these were chicken-pox, 627 measles, and 56 whooping cough. SMALL-POX. No case of small-pox was notified in the Borough last year, against no case in the previous year. CHICKEN-POX. Sixty eight cases of chicken-pox were reported, against 219 cases in the previous year. The 68 cases reported last year were treated at the homes of the patients. No death was registered. MEASLES. Six Hundred and Twentv Seven cases were reported as due to measles, against 417 cases in the previous year. Fifty six deaths were registered. As this is not a notifiable disease it is of no use my giving the mortality rate on the cases reported, as no doubt only a proportion of the cases which occurred were known of by me. Owing to the stringent instructions of the Educational Department of the London County Council most of the cases occurring among pupils at the schools of the London County Council were reported to me. A strict system of disinfection was carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1901. The disinfection of premises and fomites after cases of measles threw a large amount of extra work upon the 130 disinfection staff, but I am of opinion that taking into consideration the large mortality that arises from measles the extra labour and expense is quite called for. From the whole of the notifiable infectious diseases there were only 58 deaths, whereas from measles alone there were 56 deaths. Judging from the total results, measles was, as usual, the most dangerous infectious disease affecting the public health of the. Borough. In each of the cases that was reported the premises were at once inspected as to the sanitary condition. It would be a great step in the right direction and considerably assist the object in view, if the London County Council would make the disease notifiable. SCARLET FEVER. Four hundred and thirty nine cases were reported as due to scarlet fever, against 360 in the previous year. Three hundred and fifty eight cases reported last year were isolated at Isolation Hospitals, and 81 cases were treated at the homes of the patients. Sixteen deaths were registered. The mortality rate on the cases reported was only 3.6 per cent. DIPHTHERIA AND DIPHTHERITIC MEMBRANOUS CROUP. Two hundred and seventy cases were reported as due to diphtheria or diphtheritic membranous croup, against 237 cases in the previous year. Two hundred and forty five cases reported last year were treated at the Isolation Hospitals, and 25 at the homes of the patients. Twenty six deaths were registered. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 9.6 per cent. 131 WHOOPING COUGH. Fifty six cases were reported as due to whooping cough, against 286 cases in the previous year. All of the cases reported last year were treated at the homes of the patients. Twenty deaths were registered. As this is not a notifiable disease it is of no use my giving the mortality rate on the cases reported, as doubtless a very large number of cases occurred which were not known of in the Public Health Department. I continued to receive as heretofore information as to cases from the Head Teachers of the Schools in the London County Council. ENTERIC FEVER. Thirty three cases were reported as due to enteric fever, against 41 in the previous year. Seventeen of the cases reported last year were treated at the Isolation Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Eight deaths were registered. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 24.2 per cent. TYPHUS FEVER. No case was reported as due to typhus fever, against no case in the previous year. SIMPLE CONTINUED FEVER. One case was reported as due to simple continued fever, against no case in the previous year. The case reported last year was isolated in a hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums Board and recovered. RELAPSING FEVER. No case was reported as due to relapsing fever, against no case in the previous year. 132 PUERPERAL FEVER. Ten cases were reported as due to puerperal fever, against 13 cases in the previous year. Five of the cases reported last year were treated at the homes of the patients, and 5 of the cases were treated at the Fulham Infirmary. Three deaths were registered. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 30 per cent. CHOLERA. No case was reported as due to cholera, against no case in the previous year. ERYSIPELAS. One hundred and twenty five cases were reported last year as due to erysipelas, against 125 cases in the previous year. Seven deaths were registered. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 5.6 per cent. PLAGUE. No case was reported as due to plague, against no case in the previous year. The following table shews the number of cases that were reported as due to the undermentioned 14 zymotic diseases during the years 1897 to 1906. Year. Small-pox. Scarlet Fever.

No official action was taken in reference to this complaint, as no application was made for the disinfection of any of the houses in which death occurred. PHTHISIS The voluntary notification of phthisis, which your Council decided upon on 7th April, 1902, was continued during last year. Altogether, 105 cases were notified to me against 109 cases in the previous year. These, no doubt, represent only a small proportion of the cases that actually occurred, as 158 deaths were registered, against 172 deaths in the previous year. In all cases notified or in which death occurred, the premises were at once inspected, and after death in all cases occurring in private dwelling houses, an offer was made to disinfect the premises at the expense of your Council. In every case a printed instruction as to the course that should be adopted for the prevention of consumption was left at the premises. In very few instances was advantage taken of the offer of your Council to disinfect. Of the 105 cases notified last year, 96 were reported by the Medical Superintendents of the Infirmaries of Fulhain and Hammersmith. Only 9 were reported by private Medical Practitioners. Very little or any practical good is done by the voluntary notification of this disease. COUNCIL'S DUST SHOOT AT THE WHARF CHANCELLORS. During the last year no complaint was made of a nuisance from the depositing of the refuse at your Council's wharf. 137 LICENSED SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The whole of the 12 licensed slaughter houses in the Borough were under regular fortnightly inspection by the Inspector for offensive trades. At the annual inspection of slaughter houses in October, 1906, I had received notices that 12 licenses were to be applied for. All of them were found to be, as far as your Council's requirements were concerned, in a satisfactory condition. Your Council decided to inform the London County Council that you offered no opposition to the renewal of any of the licences, and at the Special Sessions at the London County Council, held in October, the eleven licences were granted. The license of the slaughter house at Sheep House Farm, Old Oak Lane, in the occupation of Mr. James Wiggins, was opposed by the inspector of the London County Council. It was eventually granted on the understanding that it should not again be renewed. The following is a list of the licensed slaughter houses in the Borough NORTH DISTRICT.

The whole of the 59 bakehouses in the Borough were under a regular half-yearly inspection by the Factory Inspector. One hundred and five defects were discovered upon the premises during the year. Notices were at once served upon the bakers calling upon them to comply with the regulations of your Council. In each case the notice was complied with. It was not decided to apply for any summonses against bakers whose bakehouses were found not to be in conformity with the Act, as they readily complied with the requirements of your Council when called upon by notice to do so. 139 The following is a list of the bakehouses at present in the Borough:— NORTH DISTRICT.

During last year no seizure was made of food which was unsound, unwholesome and unfit for the food of man. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. During the last year the Public Health Committee gave directions for the registrations of 275 "houses let in lodgings or occupied by the members of more than one family," making a total with those previously ordered to be registered of 2,852 premises. Upon the registration a copy of the Bye-laws of your Council under which such houses are registered, was forwarded to the landlord (within the meaning of the By-laws) for his guidance. From various causes 329 houses have been removed from the list, leaving a total number now on the Register of 2,523. During the year 231 notices were served and 219 were complied with. The registered premises were visited as often as time would allow by the special Inspector appointed 146 for that purpose. There can be no doubt that the official influence obtained by the registration oj premises has a very good effect in improving the sanitary condition of the dwellings and preventing overcrowding. SANITARY NOTICES AND ADMINISTRATION. During last year 1,984 notices were reported as having been served by your four District Sanitary Inspectors and by your house-to-house Inspector, having for their object the removal or prevention of nuisances or insanitary conditions, against 2,134 in the previous year, and during last year 1,850 notices were reported as having been complied with, against 2,018 in the previous year. The House-to-House Inspection has been continued during the year. This Inspector reports that during the year he has inspected 3,376 houses and other premises in the borough, against 3,723 houses in the previous year. As the result of his inspection defects were discovered in 698 houses, and 698 Intimation Notices were served by the House-to-House Inspector. These cases were subsequently dealt with by the four District Inspectors. Two hundred and forty-four houses coming under the provisions of the By-laws as to "Houses let in lodgings or occupied by the members of more than one family" were discovered by this Inspector, and were subsequently dealt with by the Inspector in charge of the work under the By-laws. Your Factory Inspector has during the year served 252 notices under the Factory and Workshop Act, and during the same period 244 notices have been complied with. During the previous year there were 245 notices served and 241 complied with. 147 The following is a list of the Factories and Workshops upon the Register.:— Restaurants, Hotels, &c. 90 Bakehouses 59 Bootmakers 62 Motor and Cycle Makers and Engineers 37 Dressmakers and Milliners 326 Laundries 324 Letterpress Printers and Bookbinders 27 Electrical and Mechanical Engineers 48 Smiths, Wheelwrights and Coachbuilders 34 Tailors 46 Bottle Washing Works 14 Dry Cleaning, Dyeing, aud Carpet Beating Works 16 Firewood Cutters 15 Builders and Joiners (Machine) 30 Outworkers 386 Miscellaneous 88 Total 1,512 The whole of these premises have been under a systematic inspection by your special Inspector appointed for that purpose, and numerous improvements in the sanitary condition of these premises have been carried out under his supervision. 148 Factories, Workshops, Laundries, Workplaces and Homework.

The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902, which came into operation on the 1st November, 1902, by Part VIII. made provision for the regulation, manufacture, and sale of ice cream or other similar commodities. The duty of obtaining the necessary information for the registration of premises upon which ice creams are made has been carried out as heretofore by Sanitary Inspector S. Huggons Brown. At the present time there are 205 premises upon the register and 26 notices have been served, all of which have been complied with. Sanitary Inspector S. Huggons Brown, besides having charge of the work appertaining to ice cream dealers, supervises the duties which were transferred from the London County Council in reference to the registration of premises where milk is stored or sold; also slaughter-houses and offensive trades. The following is a table in reference to the abovenamed premises. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS, and MILKSHOPS ORDER, &c. proceedings during 1905. premises. NUMBER OF PLACES. Number of inspections, 1906.

During the year two cases of infectious disease occurred upon premises where milk was sold. The regulations under the above Order appertaining to the stoppage of sale of milk, disinfection, and the granting of certificates thereafter were strictly enforced under my directions by the Officer carrying out the transferred duties. There were 69 applications made during the year for Registration of Premises for sale of Milk, and after inspection certificates were granted. SUMMONSES ORDERED. During last year your Council and the Public Health Committee gave authority for 9 summonses to be taken out against persons for having failed to comply with the requirements of notices which had been served. In most cases before summonses were issued a letter was written to the perscn in default, informing him that the Public Health Committee had ordered the summons, and asking him if he was willing to give an undertaking in writing that he would forthwith comply with the notice which had been served. In all cases the undertaking was at once given, and it was not found to be necessary to apply for a summons. It has been the object of the department, as heretofore, to take out as few summonses as possible, but at the same time in no instance to allow anyone to defy the authority of your Council. During last year no summonses were taken out through the Public Health Department. PUBLIC MORTUARY. During last year 216 bodies were removed to the mortuary at Fulham Palace Road. There were 160 bodies brought to the mortuary by order of the Coroner or the Police; 42 of these were taken from the West London Hospital and 56 bodies were received for accommodation. 153 PUBLIC NUISANCES. During last year I had occasion to bring before your Public Health Committee a complaint in reference to the following alleged Public Nuisance in the Borough. The complaint of a Public Nuisance from the Kensington Borough Council's Dust Destructor, situated at Wood Lane. The case was reported upon by me, and had the careful consideration of your Public Health Committee. SMOKE ABATEMENT. During last year observations were made in reference to the amount of black smoke emitted from the undermentioned premises, and during the same period 12 statutory notices were issued.

The percentage of adulterated samples was therefore 26-66%, and of inferior samples 11.66% All of the adulterated butters, except one which contained 2•3% excess water, were adulterated with margarine, the percentages being as follows:— 80 to 90 per cent.

COFFEE AND COCOA. Two samples of Cocoa were received and both were found to be genuine. Of the five samples of Coffee examined three were found to be genuine, one inferior, one adulterated. The adulterated sample was reported as containing 31 per cent. of Chicory. Eight samples of Coffee and Chicory were 'purchased and submitted to analysis. The percentage of Chicory was found to vary from 37 to 80. PRESERVED VEGETABLES. Three samples in all were examined, including one sample of preserved beans and two of preserved peas. All the samples were adulterated with Sulphate of Copper, but the amounts present were very small, and in no case exceeded the equivalent of 1•8 grain of crystallised Sulphate of Copper per pound. DRUGS. Twelve samples in all were examined. Six samples of Castor Oil and five samples of Glycerine were reported as genuine, and one sample of Glycerine as of inferior quality. 164 TINNED AND POTTED MEATS AND FISH. In accordance with a special request of the Local Government Board a number of samples of tinned meats and fish were obtained from the local vendors. In all, 82 samples were examined including, amongst others, specimens of Brawn, Rabbit, Corned Beef, Ham and Tongue, Boiled Mutton, Chicken and Ham, Potted Ham, Ox Tongue, Veal and Ham. They were all examined for preservatives, colouring matters, &c. A preparation of Boric Acid was found to be the usual preservaive and this was detected and estimated in 39 samples. Results are given below : TABLE V. Samples. Free from preservative. Containing Boric Acid.

In the articles enumerated above the amount of preservative found calculated in terms of crystallised Boric Acid varied from a maximum of 41 grains to a minimum of three grains per pound. The average amount found was about 176 per cent., i.e., 12 grains per pound. In cases where very small quantities were present the samples were usually mixtures such as Chicken and Ham, Veal and Ham, &c., and in all probability only one of the constituents had been originally treated with the preservative. It is evident that the addition of Boric Acid is not really necessary as so many of the preparations examined were in good condition and quite free from this substance. The percentage of adulteration for the year in the case of Milk is I4.06 compared with 8'8 for the preceeding year. Butter shows an adulteration percentage of 26.6 as compared with 24 5 for last year. The percentage of adulteration calculated from the Local Government Board Returns for the whole Metropolis for the year 1905 was Io.9 per cent. in the case of Milk and 9.3 in the case of Butter. In addition to the articles taken under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, I have examined two samples of Carbolic Powder, submitted by the Borough Surveyor, and one sample of deposit from turbine steam chest and one of pipe scale from the Borough Engineer. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, P. A. ELLIS RICHARDS, Public Analyst. Chemical Laboratory, Charing Cross Hospital, W.C. 167 ANNUAL REPORT of the BOROUGH ELECTRICAL ENGINEER, Year ended 31st March, 1907. 169 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BOROUGH ELECTRICAL ENGINEER. Electricity Department, 85, Fulham Palace Road, Hammersmith, W. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, of the Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith. Gentlemen, I have pleasure in reporting upon the working of the Electricity Department during the year ending 3Ist March, 1907:— UNITS SOLD. The quantity of current sold continues to show a very steady increase, as 579,862 more units were sold than during the previous twelve months, the current being used for lighting, power, heating, and cooking as follows :— I,8I6,8I4 units or 43 per cent. for private lighting 1,840,796 units or 43' per cent. for power, heating, cooking 563,126 units or 135 per cent. for public lighting 4,220,736 zoo per cent. It is interesting to note that the percentage of current used for power purposes was nearly 2,000,000 units which were supplied at the lower rates and cannot of course be affected by the use of high efficiency lamps. MAXIMUM DEMAND. The maximum demand upon the Generating Station increased by 413 k.w. to 3710 k.w., and occurred on 23rd November, 1906, during the period of the Motor Car Show at Olympia. The total capacity of the Generating Plant installed is 5,000 k.w. exclusive of the original Generators erected in 1896. 170 PRICE. This is the first year in which the reduced price of 3d. per unit for lighting has been in operation the whole twelve months, consequently the average price received from all our private consumers shows the large reduction of .32d. per unit, the average now being 2.oId. per unit. It is as well to explain that this figure is arrived at by taking the whole of the revenue received from private consumers for both lighting and power, and dividing by the total number of units delivered to these consumers. The average price is consequently lower than the maximum price of 3d. per unit on account of 43 per cent. of the output being sold at power rates. POWER SUPPLY. That the use of electricity for power purposes continues to make satisfactory progress in Hammersmith is proved by the fact that we have connected 3I additional motors of 307 H.P. during the year. According to a schedule prepared some six months ago, the total power required in Hammersmith is 2,300 H.P. of which I,727 H.P. is obtained through Electric Motors. Since then, however, several new factories have been decided upon, so the power will be considerably increased in the future. MAINS EXTENSIONS. Various extensions to the distributing system have been rendered necessary during the year, owing to the increase in the demand for electricity. The following is the principal work carried out:— Sedgeford Road [extension] Down Place Wormholt Road [extension] Blythe Road [extension] Palgrave Street New Feeders, Grove and Broadway Oaklands Grove Bolingbroke Road Wood Lane Caithness Road Wood Lane Sub. Shepherd's Bush Green,Pillar PUBLIC LIGHTING. There are now 264 Arc and 65 Incandescent Electric Lamps in the public streets of the Borough. During the year the lighting of Goldhawk Road and Uxbridge Road has been reorganised, 8 additional lamps being erected in Goldhawk Road, and 3 additional lamps in Uxbridge Road. 171 New lamps have also been erected in, the following positions:— Leysfield Road Emlyn Road [2] Wormholt Road Wells Road Ingersoll Road Brook Green [W. side] Flora Gardens Becklow Road COSTS. The Works costs for this year have been reduced .052d. per unit, and the total costs .017d. per unit sold. The progress in this direction continues to be very favourable, but I am afraid the great increase in the price of coal will tend to neutralize the effect of still more economical working during the present year. 1905-6. 1906-7.

On the Capital Account the position of the undertaking is as follows: At the end of March last £275,444 18s. 5d. had actually been spent upon the whole scheme, and for this machinery has been installed capable of supplying (without any reserve), a maximum demand of 5,000 units per hour, and did actually supply during the past winter a maximum of 3710 units per hour. This is equivalent to a Capital expenditure of £275,444= £75 per unit of maximum demand. 3.710 172 COMPARISON WITH OTHER UNDERTAKINGS. Is this an extravagant outlay ? The only way to ascertain is to compare the cost with other Undertakings, and the following Schedule (taken from the London County Council Electric Supply Returns, 1906), will show that the Hammersmith Undertaking has been laid down on more economical lines than any other included in the Return, so the Capital has evidently been expended to the best advantage.

How has this Capital been raised? Mr. Ebbs, the then Chairman of the Electricity and Lighting Committee, •explained this very clearly in his report, dated 8th May, I899, as follows:— "All our Capital has been raised by Mortgage loans "the equivalent of a Company's Debentures. We have " therefore first to pay interest on these loans, which this "'year (25th March, 1899) amounts to £1370 I2s. 7d. leaving " a nett profit of £2369 is. od. to the credit of our hypothetical " Shareholders. Under our special circumstances " however, because we are a Local Authority and not a " Company, we are bound to pay off an instalment of our " Mortgage Debentures, i.e. redeem some of our Debentures. "The amount paid off this year has been £919, which " leaves us with £1420 is. od. nett profit for the year." REPAYMENT OF CAPITAL. Very heavy repayments have therefore to be made for the borrowed Capital (or Debentures) employed in the business before any surplus is left over for the ordinary Shareholders (i.e. the Ratepayers), whose Shares have cost them nothing up to the present, but who have already received handsome dividends in the shape of our contributions in aid of the general rates. The following Schedule shows the aggregate Capital expended (or Debentures raised), the amount liquidated, and the interest paid during each financial year. SCHEDULE No. 2. Year ending. Total.

Not only has the amount of Capital as shown in Schedule No. 2, and the interest thereon, been paid, bu't each year large sums have been expended out of current revenue on the repair and maintenance of the Plant so as to keep it in first class working order, as unless all the Plant is maintained in this condition it is useless for electric supply purposes. New machinery and apparatus have also been purchased out of revenue instead of borrowed money, and this expenditurs is set out in the Annual Accounts under the heading of "Special Charges," being the amounts shown on column "B" of the following Schedule. SCHEDULE No. 3. Year ending. A B Amounts spent annually on repairs and maintenance of plant, buildings, &c. Amounts spent out of revenue for new plant, apparatus, &c.

This expenditure has however been left out of these calculations altogether. But not only has the £39,034 shown in Schedule No. 2 been repaid, £i6,i36 expended on repairs, and £5,070 spent on new plant, as Schedule No. 3 all been provided out of current revenue, but there has also been an annual surplus after paying all the above charges as follows: 175 SCHEDULE No. 4.

Adding this surplus to the repayment set out in Schedule No. 2 gives the following— £ Schedule No. 2 39,034 Schedule No. 4 13,250 £52,284 Less payment to Rates 4,000 Balance £48,284 as the amount allocated to, or available for liquidation of, Capital expenditure, being 17½ per cent. of the total Capital expended. ULTIMATE OBJECT. What is the ultimate object of the Undertaking? It is (a) so to arrange the repayment of the loans that they will be liquidated at the same time that the physical deterioration of the Plant renders it necessary for it to be replaced and fresh 176 loans obtained for the new machinery, or (b) to achieve the gradual purchase of the Undertaking, and after a certain length of time provide for further expenditure of a Capital nature out of current revenue instead of burdening the department with further loans ? Schedule No. 2 shows what has been done in this respect during the past ten years. In my report dated Ist May, I903, I pointed out that I did not consider the then rate of repayment, made sufficient provision for the physical deterioration of the Plant, and advocated the formation of a Depreciation Account, as well as the repayment of Capital from the annual surplus. At that time the bulk of the loans were on a 42 years basis, and the annual repayment was only 2½ per cent. Owing to the fact that most of the recent loans are for very short periods, the rate of repayment is now much increased, and an amount equivalent to the present balance, viz. £229,497 will be repaid in about 29 years if the present rate is maintained. I would specially draw attention to the fact that although a further loan of £11,145 is t0 be taken up this year, we have, according to the Annual Estimates, to repay £10,383, so the nett Capital liability at March, I908, will only be increased about £762 It appears to me that this will more than provide for the physical deterioration of the Plant, and will ultimately achieve the gradual purchase of the Undertaking for the Ratepayers if this policy is gradually extended, as the amounts now paid annually in interest will be automatically reduced, and may be used to provide fresh Capital. ORIGINAL PLANT IN GOOD WORKING ORDER. An amount equivalent to the Capital spent upon the original Plant has already been repaid, and we still have the land, and the residual value of the buildings and machinery purchased with that money as a valuable asset. The whole of the machinery is still in good working order, the only part which is not now in regular commission being the first Engines and Dynamos which cost some £6,000. They, however, act as standby and run on special occasions when it is convenient to use them in place of or to assist the larger and more economical sets. To this also must be added the goodwill of the business, which is now a very valuable asset. LOAN CURVE. The attached diagram No. I shows the yearly loans,the total liability at any period on the present Capital expenditure, the aggregate Capital expenditure to date, and the actual annual and total repayments. 177 HIGH RATE OF INTEREST. The high rate of interest now charged is a matter of special importance, and it is interesting to compare the rate of 4 per cent. for the last loan with only 2 per cent. for the first large loan. This makes a very great difference to the Department, as it must be remembered that the nett profit, or surplus simply consists of the difference between the interest earned and the interest we have to pay to the Mortgagees. At the present high rate, on the loan of £I8,985 taken up on the I5th January, I907, we pay £5,895 as interest during the I5 years, but if the loan were repayable in 42 years, £I6,380 would be paid as interest. There is, therefore, a clear saving of £I0,485 to be profitably invested in the Department instead of going into the hands of the London County Council. The more rapidly the loans are redeemed the less interest paid to outside sources, and the greater the residual value of the Plant and system. CAPITAL REPAID DURING YEAR. Dealing specifically with the present year; after paying all outgoings of manufacture and management there remains a gross profit of £I5,509 Is. 3d. earned by our outstanding Debentures, equivalent to 6.54 per cent. on the outstanding Capital. The interest which must be paid to the owners of this Capital (or Debentures) has absorbed £7,56I 2s. 2d., being at the average rate of 3.23 per cent. on the nett. liability of £229,497 plus £7,°36 =£236,535. It would be as well to explain this figure of £236,535 which is arrived at by taking the nett Capital liability of £229,497 and adding to this the overdrawn balance on Capital Account for which a loan application is now being made. This does not of course agree with the aggregate Capital expended (£275,444) but it must be remembered that the machinery, &c., purchased with this Capital has depreciated, and now stands in our bcoks at a much lower figure. When comparing the Returns of Capital invested in a Municipal trading concern with the dividends paid by Companies on their paid up Capital, it is the depreciated Capital of the Municipalities which I think should be taken and not the aggregate amount expended. The difference between the Accountant's Return of 5.6 per cent. and my figure of 6.54 per cent, is made up as follows :— Depreciated Capital £236,535. Aggregate Capital £275,444. Interest £7,65I=3.23 per cent. £7,65I=2.78 per cent. Repayment£7,829=3.31 percent. £7,829=2.84 per cent. Total £I5,480=6.54 per cent. £I5,480=5.62 per cent. 178 OVERDRAFT. Interest on overdraft £304 7s. 3d. is a very heavy item, caused by delay in obtaining the last loan of £18,985 during the time the Bank Rate was abnormally high. This abnormal rate increased the payment by about £100. Repayment of Capital absorbed a further £7,829 equivalent to 3.2 per cent. upon the outstanding Capital liability. HEAVY RECENT LOANS. From the attached diagram No. 1, it will be noticed that very heavy Capital commitments have been made during the last three years. This is on account of recent extensions to the Plant, and entails a very heavy charge the first year or so without any corresponding increase in the revenue due to the time lagg before the extra demand for electric energy profitably occupies this Plant. WORKING AND PRODUCING COSTS. Turning now to the general manufacturing expenses, being the actual cost of producing the current. This includes the cost in the Generating Station such as coal, water, oil, and wages for working the machinery, and repair and maintenance of the Plant in first class condition, distribution of the current to the consumers, and the attendance on the Public Lamps, all of which are more or less directly under the control of the staff. The cost of administration, rates and taxes, law and parliamentary, and insurance are also unfortunately necessary, but all these items are more or less beyond the control of the department. The total of these expenses is £21,753, or 58.3 per cent. of the receipts. COST PER UNIT SOLD. In order to compare these costs with other undertakings, it is necessary to take into consideration the amount of work done in each case, i.e. the number of units delivered to consumers for this expenditure. If the cost of each item is divided by the number of units sold, an approximate comparison will be obtained. This is set out in diagram No. 2 for all the London Municipal undertakings, the year ending March, 1906, being taken as a basis, these being the latest complete returns available, but this last years costs of the Hammersmith Undertaking are also given for comparison. 179 1MPROVEMENT IN COSTS. It will be seen that, notwithstanding .that our costs per unit were low the previous year, we have been able to improve upon them for the year under review. It is interesting to note the almost Continual reduction in the Cost from the commencement of supply, so now the total cost is very little more than the coal cost in the early days, as shown oil diagr&m No. 3. RATES AND TAXES. The only item which shows an increase this year when compared with the extra output is one over which we have no control, viz. Rates and Taxes. The actual money disbursed under this heading has increased from £1,508 to £2,851, or £1,343 in excess of last year. Had this item only remained the same our profit would have been £1,357. INCREASE IN PRICE OF COAL. Another cause of extra expense was the higher price we were compelled to pay for coal, being 7d. per ton increase on one Contract, and 3d. per ton on another, representing an extra payment of £193 16s. 3d. on this heading alone. I am sorry to say that this item will be still higher this year, as coal does not yet show any tendency to come down in price. ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURE. There are two items which were absent from last years account, viz. two gatekeepers and watchmen at the Electricity Works entrance, and the establishment of a Publicity Department. representing an additional expense of £324 6s. gd. These three items represent a total of £518 3s. 0d., quite independent of the extra expense on account of the larger number of units manufactured. If these items are deducted:— £ s. d. 518 3 0 Plus extra rates and taxes 1342 13 4 There is a total amount of 1860 16 4 to be taken from the figure of £21,753 0s. 5d., leaving the total manufacturing cost £19,892 4s. 1d. compared with £21,034 14s. 10d. less £516 1s. 2d. for special items=£20,518 13s. 8d. last year on the same basis. 1905-6 £20,518 1906-7 £19,892 £626 or an actual reduction of £626, in spite of the actual increase of 570.000 units sold to consumers. £343 of this has been saved on the general attendance on the Public Lamps. 180 DUST DESTRUCTOR STATIONS. Have our manufacturing costs been excessive when compared with similar undertakings? An examination of diagram No. 2 shows that while Hammersmith is not the lowest of any Undertaking in London, those which are lower have special circumstances to assist them. Hackney, Stepney, and Bermondsey have the assistance of Dust Destructors, and it is interesting to note that the actual saving effected by these concerns is very slight, and does not go to prove the existance of a "gold mine in the dust bin" talked about some time ago (and incidentally confirms the contentions of the Borough Surveyor and myself when reporting upon this question some three years ago). PUBLIC LIGHTING. It is admitted that the current required for Public Lighting is cheaper to produce on account of the better load factor, therefore the greater the percentage for this purpose the lower the cost should be. Diagram No. 4, shows the percentage of supply for private purposes and Public Lighting, and each of the Municipal Undertakings which have lower working costs have a great advantage in this respect, their percentage under this heading being in some cases double ours, thus giving them a much better load factor. Only one Undertaking has a lower coal cost, viz., Hackney, and this has a Destructor TOTAL UNITS SOLD. Turning now from the spending to the earning side of the Department, the total output, including public and private supply, is 4,220,736 units, the relative outpnts of other concerns being shown on the attached Diagram No. 5. From this it will be seen that the Hammersmith Station has the largest output for power purposes of any Municipal Undertaking in London, in spite of the fact that this is not considered an industrial area and is served by single phase alternating current. Only the small percentage of 13% of our output is used for public street lighting, whereas in some, districts as much as 37% is supplied for this purpose. This is an increase of 576,590 units compared with last year, in spite of the fact that last year's figures were largely augmented on account of the Electrical Exhibition at Olympia, and for which there was no corresponding output this year. This is also the first complete year in which the reduced price of 3d. per unit has been in force, and on account of this the revenue during the two summer quarters was actually decreased by £1,646, but the total for current sold during the year shows an increase of £335. 181 PRICES. The price charged for public supply is also the lowest of any, being only 1.33d. per unit as against 3.5d. per unit in some places, more than we now charge for the commercial or private supply. The average price obtained for the commercial supply has this year dropped to 2d. per unit, the lowest recorded at the present time. Last year the average price at Stepney was slightly lower than ours, but higher than the prices now paid in Hammersmith. It will thus be seen that the consumer in Hammersmith is now reaping a substantial advantage from his own Municipal Plant, and those who also have business premises in other districts well know the meaning of this in £ s. d. The question is whether too much has been given to him and not enough to the Ratepayer in general. It must be remembered that electricity is not a necessity like water, drainage, roads, &c., but there are possible makeshifts. The great stumbling block against the more extended use of electricity is the heavy expense thrown on the would be consumer in providing the necessary consuming devices. The Council has expended £275,440 in providing the means of supply, but this expenditure is absolutely useless unless there is a further expenditure by the Ratepayers themselves in providing the necessary wires, fittings, motors, radiators, &c. It is these people who have expended their own capital, estimated at Lamps, &c. £53,000 Motors, &c. 12,000 £65,000 who make it possible for you to earn this year's revenue of £30,597 for current sold. COMPARISON OF HEAVY AND LIGHT OUTPUT. Diagram No. 6 shows the difference between our heaviest day's output and a light summer day. It will be seen that we are compelled to spend money on consumers who take a supply just in the winter, when everyone is requiring current, and we are unable to earn any revenue from this capital during the summer. This proves the wisdom of increasing the output during the daytime for power and industrial purposes in order to provide work for the plant even if it gives a very small nett profit, as "half a loaf is better than no bread." The adoption of the powers recently obtained through the L.C.C. for hiring motors and other apparatus to consumers would greatly assist in this respect. 182 CONCLUSION. Diagram No. 7 gives the Capital liability of each London Undertaking at March, 1906. and the return upon this Capital by the gross revenue earned, from which it will be seen that, in spite of the low price obtained for both public and private supply and the relatively small output of the former, the return upon the Hammersmith Capital liability was only exceeded by two Undertakings at that date. Diagram No. 8 shows the quarterly and yearly revenues from commercial supply since the commencement. With reference to my query in the first paragraph of this Report; is this result likely to be repeated or improved upon during the coming year? The following schedule shows the progress made during the present year compared with last year:— Units supplied Advance, to Mains. 31st March to end of May, 1905 1,573,644 Do. do. 1906 1,841,563 267,919 Do. do. 1907 2,312,055 480,492 If this improvement is maintained the final result will be an increase of more than double our largest increase in any year, and there is no reason why the extra expense should be anything like the same proportion. I consider the future outlook is extremely promising. There is only one cloud on the horizon, and that is the question of fuel, but I think there is no need to be unduly pessimestic on this account. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, G. G. BELL, Borough Electrical Engineer. 183 ANNUAL REPORT of the CHIEF LIBRARIAN Year ended 31st March, 1907. 185 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CHIEF LIBRARIAN. To the Libraries Committee of the Borough of Hammersmith. Gentlemen, The Report I have the honour to present to you records the first complete year's work since the opening of the Carnegie (Central) Library, and on this account should be interesting. In the previous report allusion was made to the increase in the Reference issues owing to the larger accommodation afforded by the new building, and I am pleased to say a still further increase in this useful department of Library work has been maintained during the past year. The number of volumes in the Central Reference Library is now 6,346, an addition of 322 on last year's stock. There have been issued to readers 29,134 vols, which is an average of 95 for the 305 days the Library was open. The Reference Departments at Ravenscourt Park and Shepherd's Bush contain 57 and 691 vols respectively, and the issues number at the former 1,992, and at the latter 10,979, making a total for the three Libraries of 42,097 vols. LENDING DEPARTMENTS. The stock in the Lending Departments of the four Libraries numbers 34,896 volumes which are distributed us under: Central, 11,396; Ravenscourt Park, 11,486; Shepherd's Bush, 11,196; College Park, 818. At the Stocktaking it was found necessary to withdraw 1,189 worn out volumes from the Ravenscourt Park Library, and 322 from Shepherd's Bush. Of this number 896 have been replaced, so that notwithstanding an addition of 360 new books, the stock is not so large as last year by 290 volumes. 186 The issue at each Library was, Central, 120,824; Ravenscourt Park, 60,465; Shepherd's Bush, 86,332; College Park, 3,107; total, 270,728; daily average, 1,084. Tickets were issued to 5,039 new borrowers, Central, 2,630; Ravenscourt Park, 1,034; Shepherd's Bush, 1,338; College Park, 37; 3,671 tickets were renewed and 328 cancelled, the approximate number of borrowers being 8,382. In addition 954 Student's Tickets were issued to new borrowers. Borrowers from every ward excepting College Park have taken tickets at the Central Library, but the large number from the adjacent wards of Brook Green, the Grove, St. Paul's and St. Matthew's is ample testimony that a Library in this part of the Borough was necessary. The usual tables accompany this report, from which full particulars of the work of the various departments may be obtained. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, S. MARTIN, April 23rd, 1907.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, the Assessment Committee begs to submit its report for the year ended 6th April, 1907:— Appointment of Committee. 1. The Committee was appointed at a meeting of the Borough Council held on 25th April, 1906. The first meeting was held on the 28th June, 1906, when Alderman Chamberlen was elected Chairman, and Councillor Marsh, Vice-Chairman. Subsequent to the triennial election of Borough Councillors, Aldermen Hunter and Mulholland, and Councillors Lt.-Col. Davies, Ebbs, Lewis and J. White were, on the 14th November, 1906, appointed members of the Committee in place of Councillor Tomes and Messrs. Bendon, Boarder, Cramp, Marsh and Watkins, of whom the five latter, having ceased to be members of the Council, were no longer eligible. At a meeting held on the 23rd November, 1906, Councillor Lt.-Col. Davies was elected Vice-Chairman of the Committee. Number of Meetings. The number of meetings held was ten, and the attendances of the members were as under:— Possible Attendances. Actual Attendances. Possible Attendances, Actual Attendances.

During the year a supplemental list has been deposited with and considered by the Committee. The List contained 799 assessments made up as follows:— New assessments 523 Old assessments increased 87 Old assessments reduced 172 Assessments taken out of rating 17 799 200 The number of objections thereto was 11, of which 8 were allowed. The list came into force on the 6th April, 1907, and the net additions made thereby in the total gross and rateable values of the Borough are as follows:— Gross value £14,578 Rateable value £11,911 The total gross and rateable values of the Quinquennial Valuation list as altered by the supplemental list are:— Gross value £1,004,499 Rateable value £809,221 No appeals against the Supplemental List were made to either Special or Quarter Sessions. Provisional Lists. Seven Provisional Lists have been deposited with and considered by the Committee. The total number of assessments contained in these lists is 1,467, of which 450 represent new properties. There were 164 objections lodged against the lists, and 105 thereof were allowed, and the remainder disallowed. The totals of the Valuation List above given are further • increased by these lists as follows:— Gross value £18,341 Rateable value £14,986 Of this increase £4,272 represents the rateable value of the new Workhouse and Infirmary. Appeal to Quarter Sessions. (The Imperial Tobacco Company's Factory, 81, Fulham Palace Road).

The Register of Unemployed was re-opened on the 1st November, 1906; posters announcing same having previously been placed in various parts of the Borough. Applications were received at the Committee's Offices, 15, Great Church Lane, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. daily, except Saturday. The women were seen separately. A waiting room was provided. The Investigation Officer visited the home of each applicant for registration and made other necessary enquiries, both in and outside the Borough, particulars of which were entered on the Record papers and reported to the Committee, to guide them in their duty of classilication, in which, and in their general procedure, the Committee strictly followed the General Instructions of the Central Body. The selection of persons recommended for work and emigration was made by the Sub-Committee, each applicant appeared before them and was informed of the conditions attached to his employment or emigration, in the latter case a guarantee for repayment of part cost being necessary. 208 The payment of wages of men employed on L.C.C. Parks was made at the office, on Saturday mornings between 12 o'clock and 1 p.m. Allowances due to the wives of men who had been sent to Labour Colonies were paid by one or two members of the Committee and the office staff, at the homes of the men, each Wednesday afternoon. The only Voluntary Assistance was that rendered by members of the Committee as above, and in registration. The selection of persons recommended for emigration by the Sub-Committee was made after very exhaustive questions had been put to the applicants by the Chairman and other members, to discover their fitness and also the willingness of the wives to accompany them, in the cases of married men.

Battersea Park 18th „ „ Hyde Park 2nd „ „ Tambridge 20th July „ (12) Number of Applicants who refused work offered:— (а) On Colony Work 7 (b) Non-Colony Work 69 Total 76 (13) The reasons for the refusal of the work offered were as follows:— Obtained work in the meantime. Desire to remain with family. Ill-health of wife. Objection to leaving neighbourhood, in case work in usual occupation offered. Considered allowance too small. Preferred own trade. (14) Number of Applicants emigrated :— (a) Heads of Families 36 (b) Number of persons (including 21 single men applicants) 52 Total 88 Some applicants withdrew after all preparations were made for their sailing. 15 (a) Number and proportion of men given work in 1905-6 who re-applied 1906-7= 79 12.93 (b) Number and proportion of men applying in 1905-6 who re-applied in 1906-7= 207 14.36 The effect of the provision of work through the medium of the Distress Committee has been that it has enabled applicants to keep their homes together and redeem many articles they had to pledge in time of need, and helped them over a period of depression until they obtained work on their own account. It has benefitted them considerably in health by their being able to obtain sufficient food, and in the case of the Labour Colonies by their living in the country air. In some instances it has put hope and energy into those who were downcast and depressed when without work. 214 Men who had obtained a good report from the foreman of the Works on which they were employed, have thereby been helped to obtain other employment on their return. One applicant and his. family have been permanently settled on the land at Hollesley Ray, and another man, G. Bretherick, is selected for similar treatment, the Superintendent, Mr. Bolton Smart, speaking very highly of him. In other cases there appears to be no improvement in the position or well-being of applicants, some having done nothing but a few days' harvesting since their return from the Colony, or work provided by the Central Body, and have again registered their names at the Distress Committee's office. The advantage of the colony over the non-colony work is that it is available during the whole of the year, and offers the possibility of a more extended period of employment, with the additional advantage of living in the country air. On the other hand the non-colony work has the advantage of enabling the men to return to their homes each day, and gives them a better opportunity of finding other employment. The majority preferred the noncolony work. The special difficulty with which the Committee had to contend was the inability of many deserving applicants to remember the addresses of employers and the date of their employment. The method of payment of wages at the Committee's Office, and the allowances at the homes of applicants appears to be the best. The uses to which the opportunities of visiting the homes of colonists have been put are that of observing if the home was being properly conducted in the absence of the husband, and of giving advice as to migration or emigration. The Committee consider that Conferences of Distress Committees would serve a useful purpose in discussing the various methods of procedure. The "Reserve" system of filling vacancies has been of decided advantage in having men already selected when a vacancy unexpectedly occurs. The permission of the Central Body to Distress Committees to avail themselves of voluntary sasistance has been taken advantage of, valuable assistance at a time of pressure having been rendered by members of the Committee in registration and payment of allowances. The instructions of the Central Body, that a preliminary investigation of applications be made, with a view of ascertaining whether applicant had received Poor Law Relief and was a resident of the Borough, before filling in the record, were followed, with the result that in a number of instances it effected a saving of time by revealing the fact that applicant was disqualified under the Act. The investigation was not limited, but nearly the whole of the records taken were investigated, as it was feared that if only a limited number were investigated they might prove to be the very cases that had obtained work when they were wanted for filling vacancies, a 215 large proportion of the applicants being able to obtain only casual employment. Enquiries were made in the Borough, in November, with a view of ascertaining the probable extent of distress in the ensuing winter, with the result that it was found that the distress would be as great or worse than the previous winter. It was hoped that the building of the Franco-British Exhibition would provide work for a large number of local men, but unfortunately only a few have been engaged through the Committee for about 14 weeks. These were employed by Messrs. Wimpey & Son. One man has found permanent employment through the medium of the Committee. Letters have been received from two men sent to Canada last March, stating that they were doing well, and expressing their thanks to the Committee for the assistance rendered. The following are extracts:— From J. Self, (20) Hamilton, "I feel quite at home in Canada. I am working at The Canadian Westinghouse Co. My wages is S6.20 a week. I am expecting a rise shortly. I go to church every Sunday, and I have been confirmed. I thank you for what you have done on my behalf." From T. Favell (20), Springfield, Ontario. "I arrived 29th February, and started work on a farm 1st March, I am getting on alright. I am getting $100 a year and my board. The people I work for are very nice to me." The Resolution of the Committee, that the Canadian Government should be asked to bear part of the cost of emigration, was approved by the Central Body, who placed a similar resolution before the Conference of Colonial Premiers held in London. MIGRATION. One family has been sent to Derby, where the man was offered work, through the medium of the Committee. J. M. LEVY, Chairman. J. M. HARTLEY, Clerk to the Committee. 2l6 CASH STATEMENT—1ST APRIL, 1906, TO 30th JUNE, 1907. Receipts. Payments. £ s. d.
