I desire to present my Annual Report for the year 1964. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (acres) 770 Population (Census 1931) 25,012 Population (Census 1961) 25,743 Home Population, Mid-year 1963 (estimated by Registrar General) 26,230 Rateable Value, 1st April, 1964 Sum represented by 1d rate The district, situated on the north-west border of Kent, and immediately adjoining the Counties of London and Surrey, is on the slope of a hill, the highest point being 370 feet above sea level and the lowest 95 foot above sea level. The density of population per acre is 33.8, this being by far the highest in the County of Kent. This results in there being very few open spaces in the district, the largest one being the grounds of the Old Crystal Palace,the greater part of which is in this area. This density of building has caused a shortage of space for school playing fields for the schools in the district and pupils mainly have to go outside the area for games. The Manager of the Employment Exchange for the area informs me that he is unable at the moment to separate the Penge figures from Beckenham, but that the total figures are 219 males and 20 females.
