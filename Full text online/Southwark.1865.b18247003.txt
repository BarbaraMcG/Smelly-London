ANNUAL REPORT MADE TO THE VESTRY BY THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, FOR THE YEAR ENDING LADY-PAY, 1865. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, The period has again come round when I am required by the Metropolis Local Management Act, to place before you all the events which have happened in connexion with the health of the people of the district of St. George the Martyr, during the year ending April 1865. This duty has to be performed under various emotions. It is one of gratitude, when I am enabled to tell you of a death rate which is slowly, yet uninterruptedly decreasing; and, that the comforts and health of the people are increasing. On the other hand, it is one of sorrow when facts point contrariwise ; when called to say that the death rate is stationary, or increasing, and that misery, want, and disease, still haunt and crush down the people. In the years 1840 to 1849, the death rate in London was 25.1, in 1000 persons living. From that time until the year 1860, it gradually fell down to 22.6, in 1000 persons living. This period includes four years of earnest sanitary labour on the part of the various Vestries established in the Metropolis: hence, there was much cause for gratulation. Those who sneered at sanitary science, coupling it with the visionary schemes of the day, were silenced: those who had doubts, held them no longer: and the many who had hoped and worked, were greatly encouraged. Disease and death were looked upon as under control; and confidence was felt that man should at last measure out the length of his days, and fall only like "a shock of corn fully ripe." Seventeen deaths in 1000 persons living, were placed as the mark at which we were to aim; perhaps, to a scale lower still, inasmuch, as there were places in England where the death rate had only been 15; whilst even here, all the requirements of sanitary science had not been carried out. A most unlooked for, and most unwelcome change has, however, since 1860 come to pass. The ebb in the death rate had in that year reached its lowest; ever since, it has been on the flow 12 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. until it has washed over the old tide mark, and gone beyond; for, in 1864 the death rate had reached 26.45 in 1000 persons living. The causes which have been in operation, and which have produced these calamitous results, have not been confined to London. They have spread over nearly all the divisions in England and Wales; and Scotland also. The countryman has suffered alike with the citizen: the village with the town. If asked what change there has taken place upon the earth; or, what deleterious agent there has been infused into, or formed in the atmosphere, rendering what was productive of health alone, now productive of disease: and which has affected both the animal and vegetable kingdom? I answer, that I cannot tell. The epidemic which fell upon the potato, which it well nigh destroyed, and the dread results that followed, are still fresh in our remembrance. But what error had this plant committed ? It had neither breathed impure air, nor been intemperate, nor starved, nor overcrowded, nor in any way transgressed those sanitary laws which humanity is daily transgressing. Yet, it became terribly diseased. Our ignorance should make us tolerant, whilst at the same time it should urge us onwards in the carrying out those duties required of us. Progress is slow and laborious; and there will be many a fall and backward slide on the way. But, suppose our sanitary conditions had been less favourable during the last few years; who can tell what fatal epidemic might have ravaged the land, and to what extent the mortality might have been raised ? I place before you the following Table, shewing the number of deaths in each subdistrict, for every week in the year; with the mean temperature as determined by Mr. Glashier at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.

Kent Road 469 19652 Borough Road 707 16668 London Road 470 19190 Total 1646 65510 It will be seen that the Borough Road sub-district with the smallest population has the largest number of deaths. Part of this excess is owing to the workhouse being placed within it, to which the sick and dying poor are taken from the other sub-districts. Much, however, is due to its overcrowded condition. The subject of over crowding has been so repeatedly brought before you, that I will only slightly dwell upon it. Its prevalence is only too obvious, as also are the moral and physical results which follow. The question is,—how is it to be got rid of? This Vestry has the power to abate overcrowding; but, from the nature of the circumstances, it is useloss. We cannot turn the people out into the streets : by sending them from one place to another, comes no good; there remain the same number of persons, and the same limited income; hence, a room similar to the one left is obtained; to which must be added the 14 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. inconveniences and losses incidental to removal. Before we eject the industrious poor, it is but reasonable that we have better houses for them to go into. They are not to be harried about from a mere desire of doing something. Overcrowding seems to be a permanent evil, both as regards time and place. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, warning was given against the inhabitants "being heaped together and in a sort smothered with many families of children and tenants in one house, or small tenement." Whilst in villages and the cottages of the agriculturers it is met with, in its worst form; and in New Zealand we are told that men, women, and children for ten hours out of twenty-four hours "respire an atmosphere which is as unwholesome as the most crowded and worst ventilated houses in some of the poor parts of London." But this evil of overcrowding is not viewed alike by all. There are men of undoubted experience, and of as undoubted benevolence, who think we are partial and narrow in our aims, and that we attribute far too much to overcrowding, forgetting that there are other causes in operation quite as powerful, in producing the results we are endeavouring to do away with. That great preacher and theologian, Dr. Guthrie, says, "much nonsense is talked and written about the diseases and deaths caused by overcrowding. Some staticians, for example, take a respectable district of a town, and find a certain percentage of death-rate occurring there: then, they take another but disreputable district with the same number of inhabitants, and find that it has, say, double the number of deaths; and ascertaining the inhabitants in the latter are crowded into half the space occupied by the other quarter, they leap at once to the conclusion, that the main, if not the sole cause of this terrible mortality in the disreputable district lies in overcrowding, and the want of a sufficient supply of pure air. We admit the importance of a supply of pure air; and yet believe that the gentlemen referred to, by overlooking other elements of disease and death besides overcrowding, offer illustrations of the famous saying, 'That there is nothing so false as figures, but facts.' Transfer the people amongst whom there is such a dreadful mortality to the lofty and spacious chambers of a palace, and unless you change their habits with their houses, the bills of mortality will shew little improvement. It is drunkenness with its attendant train of evils, insufficient nourishment, inadequate clothing, cold, hunger, cruel usage, and broken hearts, with want and misery in a hundred forms to which the high mortality of these districts is chiefly owing. Knowing what we say, and whereof we affirm, we say if foul air kills its thousands, drunkenness kills its ten thousands." Statements of this kind are worthy of grave consideration, if only to shew why fuller and plainer evidence of the good results of sanitary work are not more manifest. Still, I think Dr. Guthrie does not give sufficient weight to the evils which must necessarily follow, from the poor being compelled to pass their lives in the wretched dwellings now only open to them. These dull and squalid homes too often drive their unhappy occupants to the noisy glaring gin shop, where they waste away those means they possess—their time, money, and health. Gin shops do not make thirsty or drunken people: thirsty or drunken people make the gin shop. There is a demand, and that is supplied. Suitable homes for the working classes are a necessity, a grave necessity. Houses built for the purpose of subletting, with all necessary conveniences on every floor, and with rents which would meet that class whose earnings range from 12/ to 20/ per week. It is no use talking about benefitting the poor until this is done. There are streets, and courts, and alleys which are not fit for habitation, and never can be made so; and as long as these remain, so long 15 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1864. will remain room for complaint. That the evil of drunkenness would be cured thereby, I do not for one moment wish to infer; its origin lies far deeper, deep as the heart of man; but it would, I believe, be greatly diminished. I have no sympathy with that advocacy of sanitary reform which gives rise to expectations which cannot be realised, and to hopes destined only to be disappointed. The births registered in the year were 2068; and the birth rate was 37 per 1000. 1,646 deaths were registered; this number exceeds that cf 1859-60 by 262; but, is less than that of 1863-4 by 43. The annual rate of mortality was 29½ per 1000; or, one death in 34 of the population.

Of all the diseases of this class, except fever, scarlatina has been most fatal; 78 persons died of that disease. Diarrhoea was fatal to 44; and typhus to 128. This disease destroyed in all London during the year 1864, 3,689 persons. Of small pox 8 died. The small pox epidemic is now extinct. It commenced in 1860, and has added considerably to the death rate. What that cause is, which gives rise to these epidemics, we are profoundly ignorant; as we are of their sudden outbreaks at certain times and places. We are not so ignorant, however, of those causes which aid their progress, and increase their fatal power. It may he that there is a specific for each lying close at hand, and which only awaits a second Jenner. But having a specific by no means implies the use of it. For that hideous disease which defaces, blinds, and destroys, might have been extinguished half a century ago: yet, from the years 1859-60 to 1863-4 it has killed 183 persons within the limits of this district; besides the many it has physically injured, as well as sown the seeds of diseases to spring up at some future time. It was found at the small pox hospital that the 16 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. death, rate of 1,273 persons who had been vaccinated, but who had taken the small pox, reached a little over 9 per cent.; whilst that of 247 persons afflicted with small pox, and who had not been vaccinated, was 47 per cent., nearly four times as great. Vaccination when carefully, efficiently, and universally performed, will render small pox historical—a thing of the past. 197 persons died of diseases of the brain and nerves; still an increase in the affections of these important organs. Deaths of disease of the heart are the same in number as in the year, 1863-4. TABLE 5.

Fifty deaths were referred to violence. Fifteen of these were children, their ages ranging from 10 days to 9 months, and were found suffocated in bed. A child aged 1 year, died from exhaustion, the result of a blister: another, newly born, was found dead in King Edward Street. A male, 3 years old, was scalded to death, by falling into a tub of hot water; and 1, aged 4 years, died from upsetting over herself a cup of boiling cocoa. Four persons were burnt to death from their clothes taking fire; 2 of them were children, and 2 were elderly people : one of the latter fell into the fire whilst in a fit. A male, aged 32 years, died from the effects of a pail falling on his head. A male, 28 years, was carried off by inflammation of the lungs, the result of falling from a barge into the Thames. A child, aged 2 years, was suffocated from a piece of fat sticking in his throat. A male, 66 years old, fell from a window and was killed; another, aged 20 years, died from a bag of coffee falling upon him, and rupturing his bowels. Three persons died from internal injuries, having been run over, aged respectively 7, 29, and 67 years. A male, aged 7, was poisoned by drinking muriatic acid in a mistake. A female and 2 males hung themselves. Two persons poisoned themselves, 1 aged 47, by taking prussic acid; and the other, aged 49, by taking nux vomica. Two males cut their throats. A new born infant was found wilfully murdered. The oldest age registered was that of a man who died 97 years old; ho lived in Westminster Road. We have as usual visited the bake-houses, cow-houses, and slaughter-houses, and have seen the requirements of the various "Acts" carried out. I cannot give you the analyses of the waters of the Southwark and Lambeth Companies, owing to the death of Dr. Robert Dundas Thomson, F.E.S. Professor Hoffman, F.R.S., has now undertaken to perform the duty, so they will be continued as heretofore. The necessity and value of pure water is hardly held at its true importance. A number of diseases destructive to life, or, anyhow rendering life miserable, may be conveyed by its means into the system; varying from the sudden and fatal attack of cholera, to the nameless wretched sensations and nervous affections dependent on indigestion. Water forms more than half the weight of the body, and is the medium by which the most important of its functions are carried on. The steps taken against the Corporation of Kingston were 17 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health.—1864. deserving of all praise; thereby, preventing a discharge of the sewage of that town into the Thames, between Teddington and Staines. If this had been permitted, or similar proceedings, what would have availed the people here spending millions of money, in constructing drains for the purpose of purifying that portion of the river which flows through the Metropolis? This Vestry has also wisely and opportunely petitioned the Legislature, to prevent the polluting of the rivers and streams of the kingdom, especially of the river Thames, by the introduction of sewage above the Metropolis. " The sparkling rivulet," says a recent writer, "the crystal stream, the majestic river—pure sources of health, plenty, and refreshment, have been, of late especially, used unscrupulously for the vilest purposes." The unutterable compound we did drink, and, to some extent do still, could scarce be credited. It is marvellous how patient and apathetic we are under the most serious evils, just because they have grown upon us; and it is only when they have become intolerable, that measures are taken for their removal. We want pure water, not diluted sewage. We want more of it—a constant supply; so that those standing nuisances, water butts, next in mischief to cess-pools, may be abolished. These butts are almost always improperly situated, owing to want of room: no one considers it his duty to clean them; consequently they are always dirty. The Registrar General attributes the great increase of deaths during the last autumn, partly to the water of the wells and streams, which were scanty, as well as impure, from the deficiency of the rain fall. I had intended to have made some observations respecting the expediency either of sending fever patients to the hospital, or, of having them treated in their own homes; this intention, however, I must defer until another time.

R. ... ... ... ... ... 1 ... 3 I finally, give you a table in which the streets are named where deaths from zymotic diseases have taken place, as well as those from dentition and convulsions. In the main, the majority of the deaths have occurred in those streets where the houses are of the lowest description, and where poverty is met with in its extremest form; whilst there are others Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1864. 19 where the deaths of this class have been numerous, without the causes mentioned being to any great extent in operation. Surrey Street shews the largest number; yet this street was less than two years ago, sewered and drained from end to end; and the houses upon the whole are of a better kind. Next follow as regards this special mortality, Southwark Bridge Road, "Westminster Eoad, and Old Kent Road; all good open roads, and well sewered, with, perhaps, the exception of Southwark Bridge Eoad, Elliott's Eow, from its largo yards behind on the west side, and its equally large gardens in front on the east side, and from its general good sanitary condition, I should have expected would have escaped more lightly than the record tells. St. George's New Town has drawn to itself latterly a great share of attention, from the fever having there been so persistent and wide spread. Contrast this place as it is now, with what it was three years ago. Then, the roads were in the filthiest condition possible; full of holes, with neither drain nor gulley : the houses with cess-pools attached, imperfectly drained, and in a dilapidated condition. Now, the former have been picked up, raised, and channelled; gullies placed where needed; the curbstones also raised and made good; whilst the latter have all been drained, water-closets substituted for cess-pools, and constant repairs been carried on. For, not only will the squalid and wretched dwelling sap the virtue of the tenant, but in like manner will the careless, dirty, and vicious habits of the tenant bring down the dwelling to his own level. Our forefathers knew nothing about the public health, and cared less; they added house to house, and street to street according to their own will and apparent benefit, and so have left us this mingled heritage. Towns were the result, and from them comes civilization. Without them, commerce with its ships on every sea, and its markets in every land, would have had no place. Arts, literature, science, and whatever tends to exalt and adorn a people, have had in them their origin. They are the hearts which throb out into the nation, its life blood. A nation of scattered people could not exist as such. "At present above a sixth part of the nation is crowded into principal towns of more than thirty thousand inhabitants: "yet towns have proved fatal to man. There is that within them which undermines his constitution, and which is ever pushing him down into a lower degree of manhood. "I believe," says the late Sir A. Carlisle, "that no person town bred in both the male and female lines ever extended their children to the fourth generation." This degeneracy, the result of what has been called the "great town system," has its origin from some or all of the following causes:—unhealthy locality, a noxious local and general atmosphere, insufficient air, insufficient and improper food, unhealthy occupations, social misery, wretchedness, and crime (Aitkin.) To the getting rid of these, must our earnest and never ceasing labour be given. As. is the moral state of a city, so will be its social condition ; and its moral state will depend, to a large extent, upon the obedience paid to sanitary laws. But when all is done, much will still remain outside all sanitary influence. We "cannot control the overtasked brain of the scholar; or restrain the appetite of the glutton; or give peace of mind, or exercise of body to the careworn man of business." Neither can we repress the unruly passions, nor the restless ambition, nor the vanity, nor the intense selfishness of man ; nor can we enable him to resist the temptations which lie in wait for him on every side; nor make the "battle of life" less a struggle ; nor the means of subsistence more sure and certain. But any evil which comes within the power of this Yestry to mitigate or destroy, will not be permitted to range uncontrolled within the district of St. George the Martyr. May 23rd, 1865.
