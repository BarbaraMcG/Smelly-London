Borough of Wimbledon Public Health Department ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the YEAR ENDED 31st DECEMBER, 1962 ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Wimbledon, S.W.19. (WIMbledon 6262) August, 1963. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Wimbledon. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the work of the Public Health Department for the year 1962. This Report is compiled in accordance with the instructions contained in Circular 1/63 of the Ministry of Health, and is on similar lines to previous years. I am pleased to report that the health of the Borough during 1962 was good and there were no special outbreaks of infectious disease. Live births in Wimbledon in 1962 numbered 930, giving a birth rate, per thousand of the population of 15.85 which compares with 892 births and a rate of 15.18 in 1961. There has been a steady increase in the birth rate for the past five years and the rate for 1962 was the highest recorded in the Borough since 1948. Of the 930 live births 66 or % were illegitimate. The live birth rate for England and Wales for the year was 18.0. Deaths numbered 756 as against 706 in 1961. This gives a death rate of 11.03 per thousand population compared with 10.39 in 1961. The excess of births over deaths was 174 compared with 217 in the previous year. The death rate for England and Wales for the year was 11.9. The number of infant deaths (under 1 year of age) was 13 out of 930 live births which gives an infantile mortality rate of 13.97 per thousand live births, one of the lowest rates on record. The infant mortality rate for England and Wales for 1962 was 21.6 the same rate as in 1961 when the lovrest figure ever was recorded. Stillbirths numbered only 13 as against 17 in 1961, despite the increase in the birth rate. There were no maternal deaths. (i) Heart disease, in one form or another was, as usual, the principal cause of mortality, 293 deaths being attributable to this group of diseases. Of the total, which was an increase of 39 on last year's figure, 161 were due to coronary disease of the heart. Cancer was the second greatest cause of death although the total deaths (131) were less than in the preceding year. Deaths from cancer of the lung showed a welcome decrease following the big rise in 1961 but the proportion of male deaths due to lung cancer was again relatively high. In December arrangements were made for a mobile Health Education Unit provided by the Central Council for Health Education in co-operation with the Ministry of Health to visit a number of Secondary Schools and Youth Organisations in Wimbledon in connection with the campaign to discourage smoking among children and young adults and to prevent the smoking habit. The mobile unit was staffed by two University Graduates who had been specially trained and briefed to deliver talks on the subject of smoking and health and were expert in the use of visual aids. The Unit's programme was very well presented and was fully employed during its' stay in Wimbledon but there is no way at present of assessing the results of the campaign. Eight deaths were reported from motor vehicle accidents, this being two less than last year. All other accidents accounted for fourteen deaths which was two more than in the previous year. Suicides accounted for nine deaths, the same number as in 1961. It is most gratifying to be able to report a substantial fall in the number of new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis notified during the year. Only 22 cases were notified compared with 34 in 1961. This is a most encouraging sign and it is hoped that this downward trend will continue. The treatment of tuberculosis by modern drugs has completely altered the aspects of this disease and the mortality rate has been vastly reduced. Only 4 deaths were attributable to tuberculosis in 1962 compared with 37 deaths a quarter of a century ago. The disease, however, retains its' high infectivity and intensive search for early cases must continue. The Mass Radiography Service has been of the greatest help in this respect. The Year 1962, as a whole, was not a particularly notable one as regards infectious disease but it commenced in a sensational manner due to a number of cases of Smallpox being imported into this country by the arrival by air of infected immigrants from Pakistan. This created many problems and a considerable amount of additional work. Although no cases of Snallpox occurred in Wimbledon there were a number of persons who had been in contact with cases, or believed that they may have been, in addition to travellers from Pakistan who were staying in Wimbledon, all of whom had to be kept under regular surveillance. Another problem which had to be dealt with was the overwhelming demand from the public for vaccination. (ii) Mass vaccination of the population in Wimbledon was never considered necessary, but in view of the insistent demand from a section of the public the situation had to be dealt with, and arrangements were made for exterded clinics to be held. Although mass vaccination was discouraged, anyone who was at special risk was strongly advised to be vaccinated, and anyone who was frightened about the situation, and there seemed to be many, and who really felt he should be vaccinated, was vaccinated, either at a Surrey County Council Clinic or by his General Practitioner. The public morale in this way was sustained but in dealing with the situation a tremendous burden was placed upon the staff until the "scare" had subsided. Overall, there was a big increase in the number of persons vaccinated in 1962, but as the Surrey County Council did not ask for records of adults vaccinated by General Practitioners the total number of persons vaccinated during the year is not known. Some guide to the increased number of persons vaccinated was, however, reflected in the big increase in the number of International Certificates of Vaccination which were received from the public for authentication. These certificates are required for the purpose of travel to certain foreign countries but during the Smallpox outbreak most continental countries insisted upon these certificates although they are not normally required. During 1962, 4,343 certificates were brought to the Public Health Department for authentication compared with 688 in 1961 which was the previous highest figure. Notifications of infectious disease amounted to only 163 compared with 1064 in 1961. The decrease was largely due to the low incidence of measles with only 122 cases being notified compared with 980 in 1961. There were no deaths from infectious disease. No cases of Poliomyelitis were notified. Once more, for the thirteenth year in succession Wimbledon was completely free from Diphtheria. There were, however, outbreaks of the disease in unimmunised children in some parts of the country which serves to emphasise to parents the importance of keeping their children as highly immune as possible and for the initial protection to be given in the first year of life. As I have stressed in previous reports it is only by maintaining a high level of immunity that the population will be safeguarded from the return of this dreaded disease. Poliomyelitis vaccination continued to be offered throughout the year to all persons up to the age of 40 years and certain other priority classes. In the early part of the year oral vaccine (Sabin Vaccine) became available in this country and was first used in Clinics in Wimbledon in March and was increasingly used throughout the year. Further good progress was made during the year towards the establishment of Smoke Control Areas throughout the Borough under the Clean Air Act 1956. In conclusion, I should like to take this opportunity of expressing to the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee my appreciation for the consideration and courtesy which they have shewn to me during the year. (iii) My thanks are also due to all members of the staff of the Health Department for the loyal and efficient way in which they have carried out their duties. I would like to thank Mr. Cockell, the Chief Public Health Inspector, and Mr. Richardson, my Chief Clerk, for their contribution in connection with the preparation of this Report. I am also indebted to my colleagues in other Departments for their ready help on all occasions. I have the honour to be Your obedient Servant, P.J. DOODY Medical Officer of Health.

All rates used in this report are based on the Registrar-General's figures. BIRTHS The statistics supplied by the Registrar-General show that during the year 1962, the total number of registered live births belonging to Wimbledon was 930. Of this number 492 were males and 438 females. This gives a birthrate of 16.35 per thousand of the population as compared with a rate of 15.65 per thousand in 1961, and an average of 15.18 in the last five years. A comparability factor has been supplied by the Registrar-General which enables the birth-rate for Wimbledon to be compared with that for England and Wales. The corrected birth-rate for Wimbledon in 1962 was 15.85 per thousand of the population, whilst the rate for England and Wales was 18.0 and has averaged 17.0 over the past five years. STILLBIRTHS - The number of stillbirths registered during the year was 13 (5 males and 8 females), this being 4 fewer than last year. The stillbirth rate for Wimbledon was 0.22 per thousand of the population, whilst that for England and Wales was 0.33. ILLEGITIMACY - Of the live births registered in 1962, 66 (23 males and 43 females) were illegitimate, this being 3 more than in the preceding year. One of the 13 stillbirths registered was illegitimate. DEATHS The total number of Wimbledon residents who died during 1962 was 756 (367 males and 389 females), giving a death-rate of 13.29 per thousand of the population as compared with 12.38 per thousand for 1961. The corrected deathrate for 1962 was 11.03 per thousand as compared with a rate of 11.9 per thousand for England and Wales. The number of Wimbledon residents who died outside the Borough was 305, whilst 399 persons not normally resident in Wimbledon died in institutions, etc. in the Borough. - 7 - The four principal causes of death were as follows Number of deaths Percentage of total deaths Disease of the heart and circulatory system 293 38% Cancer 131 11% Vascular lesions of nervous system 103 13% Diseases of the respiratory system 120 15% 647 83% The following is an analysis of the causes of death:- Males Females Total 1.

The maternal mortality rate for England and Wales per thousand live and still births was 0.35. The following table sets out the number of deaths and death rates per thousand total live and stillbirths for 1962:- Number of Deaths Rate ENGLAND AND WALES Maternal causes, excluding abortion 243 0.28 Due to abortion 57 0.07 Total maternal mortality 300 0.35 The estimated mid-1962 female population for England and Wales age 15-44 was 9,235,000. As stated there were no maternal deaths in Wimbledon during 1962. INFANTILE MORTALITY During 1962 there were 13 deaths among infants under one year of age, the same number as in 1961. This compares with an average of 16 in the last five years. Two of the deaths were in respect of illegitimate children. The resultant infant mortality rate for Wimbledon per thousand live births was 13.97 compared with 14.57, 19.20, 23.64 and 18.89 in the previous four year8. The infant mortality rate for England and Wales in 1962 was 21.6 the same rate as in 1961 when the lowest figure ever was recorded. Seven of the 13 deaths were due to prematurity and atelectasis, 3 were due to congenital defects or birth injuries and 2 deaths were due to pneumonia One child died as the result of a collapse of a lung secondary to an operation for removal of lymposarcoma. The number of neo-natal deaths (i.e. those occurring during the first four weeks of life) was 10, giving a neo-natal death rate of 10.7 per thousand live births, as compared with a rate of 15.1 for England and Wales. The perinatal death rate (i.e. stillbirths and deaths of infants under 1 week) was 23.3 per thousand live and stillbirths, while that for England and Wales was 30.8. 9 The perinatal death rate is now looked upon with increasing importance as perinatal deaths account for eighty per cent of the total loss of infant life from the twenty eighth week of pregnancy to the end of the first year of life. It will be noted that of the 13 infant deaths in Wimbledon 9 occurred in the first week of life. The most promising way to reduce infant mortality is by concentrating on the prevention of perinatal deaths. The following table shows the cause of the 13 infant deaths which occurred during 1962, together with the age at death.

Consequently, it is not strictly possible to compare the death-rate for Wimbledon with that for England and Wales for those years. SECTION B. - GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA LABORATORY FACILITIES The Ministry of Health Public Health Laboratory at Epsom is available for the examination of samples of milk, ice cream and water and of any pathological specimens. Considerable use is made of these facilities by the Public Health Department. In addition, the staff is always available to assist the Medical Oficer of Health in field investigations in the case of epidemics or outbreaks of food poisoning.

The Wimbledon Borough Council la responsible for the registration and supervision of Nursing Homes in the Borough. Nine visits of inspection were made during 1962. No new Nursing Homes were registered during the year but one Home closed down. One Maternity Hospital and one Home for unmarried mothers were exempted, on an annual basis, from registration under Section 192 of the Public Health Act 1936. The position at the end of 1962 was as follows:- Number of Homes Number of beds provided for:- Maternity Others Totals Homes first registered during the year Nil Nil Nil Nil Homes whose registrations were withdrawn during the year 1 Nil 14 14 Homes on the register at the end of the year 4 Nil 62 62 Homes exempt from registration at end of year 2 62 14 76 The Nursing Homes in Wimbledon were again found to be maintained and run in a satisfactory manner. Close supervision was paid during the visits to the way in which the records of the Homes were kept, that proper attention was being paid to fire precautions, and the Council's byelawe were being complied with. - 14 - NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT 1948 - CARE OF THE AGED Under Section 47 of the above Act, power is given to the Councils of County Boroughs and County Districts to apply to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction for an Order for removal and detention, in a suitable hospital or other place, of persons who (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease, or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions; and (b) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. The 1951 National Assistance (Amendment) Act enables Local Authorities to deal more expeditiously with very urgent cases by initial removal, for a period not exceeding three weeks. A number of border line cases were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department for investigation during 1962 but fortunately it was not found necessary for the Council to make application to the Court for any Orders for compulsory removal. All necessary help and advice was given in each individual case investigated, and every effort made to improve the conditions found upon inspection. Although the care of the aged still presents a considerable problem an increasing amount continues to be done for them but in many cases the old people create their own problems by refusing to co-operate. The District Nurses and Home Helps play an important part in the care of elderly persons in their own homes and the voluntary services such as the Guild of Social Welfare do excellent work with their many services such as "Meals on Wheels", Old Peoples Clubs etc. A laundry service for incontinent patients is another service recently provided for the elderly which considerably reduces the burden on relatives and makes it possible for patients to be nursed at home who would otherwise be admitted to hospital. The close liaison which has been established between the Geriatric Department of St. Helier Hospital, the Guild of Social Welfare, the General Practitioners and your Medical Officer of Health continued and strengthened throughout the year. - 15 - MASS RADIOGRAPHY The South West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board provides this service for the whole of Wimbledon and from time to time one of their units visits the Borough and carries out surveys of groups of workers and residents in the area. These surveys are usually of one or two weeks duration. In addition to these concentrated surveys the Mobile Chest Radiography Unit visits Wimbledon and Raynes Park each week throughout the year. This Service which was set up in 1956 primarily for the use of general practitioners' patients, is now available to all members of the public, as follows:- WIMBLEDON - Car Park, Grove Hotel (opposite South Wimbledon Tube Station) Mondays 7.30 - 8.30 p.m. RAYNES PARK - Raynes Park Station, Grand Drive Entrance. Thursdays 7.30 - 8.30 p.m. I am indebted to the Medical Director of the Mass Radiography Service for the following particulars of Persons examined and abnormalities found in the Wimbledon area. As these facilities are available to all, the figures do not necessarily relate to Wimbledon residents only.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. WATER SUPPLY. The Metropolitan Water Board is responsible for the supply of water to the Borough and regular periodic examinations are made by that Authority. The supply of water has been satisfactory in both quantity and auality. With five exceptions all the dwelling houses in Wimbledon are supplied from public water mains direct to the houses. During the year 1962, samples of water were taken for bacteriological and/or chemical analysis, as follows:- Bacteriological. Public Swimming Baths 58 Dwelling houses:- Metropolitan Water Board supply 5 Well water 7 12 Other Premises:- Metropolitan Water Board supply 1 71 Eight of the reports upon samples of Swimming Bath Water indicated that chlorination appeared to be inadequate. Action was taken, and subsequent samples proved satisfactory. All other samples of water proved bacteriologically satisfactory. Chemical. Dwelling Houses:- Metropolitan Water Board 1 This sample of water proved chemically satisfactory. One well water supply is known to be liable to have plumbo-solvent action, and the galvanized service pipe line to a dwelling house was replaced by Alkathene tubing in 1958. Subsequent samples have been free of metallic content. - 21 - Other information required by Ministry of Health Circular 1/63 is as follows:- Number of dwelling houses supplied from public water mains:- (a) Direct to the houses No record kept. Population supplied Est.1962 - 56,850 (b) By means of stand-pipes Nil Population supplied Nil SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL. The arrangements for sewerage and sewage disposal in the Borough are adequate. The Corporation's Sewage Disposal Works is capable of taking the whole flow of it, but a scheme for the completion of the modernisation of the Works has not yet reached finality. REGISTERED COMMON LODGING HOUSES. These are no registered common lodging houses within the Borough. INSPECTION OF THE DISTRICT.

These figures relate to the position at 31st December, 1962s- Number of prefabricated bungalows provided since the end of the war 71 (At the end of 1962, 11 had been demolished). - 28 - Number of families rehoused by the Council or by private owners at the Council's instigation since the beginning of the war 2,506 Number of live applications on the housing list for:- (a) Accommodation in Wimbledon 547 (b) Accommodation in Frimley and Camberley 164 New houses erected etc. I am indebted to the Borough Engineer and Surveyor for the following information:- Number of new houses and flats erected in Wimbledon in 1962:- Private enterprise 120 Local Authority 11 Number of flats created by conversion in 1962:- Private enterprise 47 Local Authority NIL RENT ACT 1957. This Act came into force on the 6th July, 1957, and in certain respects modified the powers and duties of Local Authorities under the Rent Acts and other enactments. Those Sections of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act 1954 relating to Certificates of Disrepair were repealed by the new Act which provided for an entirely new procedure in connection with applications by tenants for Certificates of Disrepair. The following is a summary of the position on the 31st December, 1962:- Applications for Certificates of Disrepair (Form I) 254 Applications withdrawn by applicants 14 Forms J sent to landlords 234 Undertakings given by landlords (Form K) 131 Certificates of Disrepair issued (Form L) 100 â€¢Applications for Cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair (Form M)95 Certificates of Disrepair cancelled 67 Number of visits made during 1962 in connection with the Rent Act 1957 - 40. SECTION E. - INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF POOD MILK In accordance with the provisions of the Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations 1959, the handling, distribution and sale of milk continued to receive the necessary attention. The number of Distributors of milk in the Borough, as shown by the register kept in accordance with the Regulations, is 4.2..

There are no slaughterhouses within the Borough, and no slaughtermen's licences were issued under the provisions of the Slaughter of Animals Act 1958, during the year 1962. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT 1955. The inspection of food premises has formed an important part of the work of the Public Health Inspectors during the past year. 1,785 visits were made to premises in which foodstuffs, intended for human consumption, were prepared, stored or sold. All food premises must comply with the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations 1960, and a considerable amount of work has been done under the Regulations during the year. In general, it has been found that food traders within the Borough are co-operative and I have reason to believe that the assistance and advice given by the Department is appreciated. The register of food premises includes the following Greengrocers 67 Confectioners 137 Ice-cream premises 196 Bakers 34 Grocers 124 Provision dealers 89 Butchers 42 Fishmongers 21 Milk distributors 42 Chemists 22 Licensed premises 74 Clubs 32 Restaurants and Cafes 79 Works canteens 15 School canteens 52 Kitchens (Hospital and Central Kitchens) 5 Food stalls/vehicles 17 Places of public entertainment 18 1,066 The number of food premises registered in accordance with Section 16 of the Act is as follows Registered for the storage and sale of ice-cream 150 Registered for the manufacture and sale of icecream 1 Registered for the preparation or manufacture of sausages 35 Registered for the preparation or manufacture of potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food 37 - 31 - The number of inspections of registered food premises during 1962 was 207. unsound food. Following the closing down of the Corporation's refuse disposal works at the end of 1955, arrangements were made with Merton and Morden U.D.C. for the reception of unsound food surrendered to the Health Department.

The Public Analyst reported that these samples contained an added preservative and no notices to this effect were exhibited in the retail shops at the time of purchase of the samples. The Health Committee instructed the Town Clerk to send warning letters to the retailers concerned. BLUE CHEESE DRESSING. Two labels were affixed to the bottle containing this formal sample of Blue Cheese Dressing which had been imported from the U.S.A. The wording on each of the labels was not identical and in neither case did it conform to the requirements of the Labelling of Food Order 1953. Correspondence with the distributors resulted in stocks being withdrawn and en undertaking was given that subsequent stocks would be correctly labelled. 36 beef puree. Two complaints were received from residents of Wimbledon regarding Beef Puree Baby Food which had been purchased locally. Sample tins were examined and found to be in a "blown" condition. Shops in the Borough were visited and a quantity of tins of Beef Puree were surrendered for destruction. Samples were submitted to the Public Analyst. Legal proceedings were instituted against the manufacturers of this article. The defendant company pleaded guilty and was fined Â£5.0.0. on each of two charges together with a total of Â£7.7.0. costs. bread and cheese rolls. A purchaser complained that the cheese in bread rolls was in a mouldy condition at the time of purchase. The report by the Public Analyst confirmed that the cheese was, in fact, mouldy, and the matter was resolved informally after an interview with the cafe proprietor who prepared the cheese rolls. CHOCOLATE LIQEUR NOVELTY. A label said to have been affixed to a chocolate novelty, in the form of a bottle, described the contents as being 1/lOth pint and 80Â° proof liqueur. The complainant alleged that the novelty did not in fact contain any liqueur. This was confirmed by the Public Analyst upon his examination of part of the novelty. Upon investigation it was discovered by the Importer that supplies had now been discontinued. The Health Committee instructed the Town Clerk to send a warning letter in this case. cottage cheese with chives. A partly used carton of cottage cheese with chives was submitted to the Public Analyst who reported that the article was unfit for consumption. Investigation revealed that the carton had been exposed for sale for a period of time in excess of normal shelf life. The Health Committee instructed the Town Clerk to send a warning letter to the person concerned. creamed rice pudding. A can of creamed rice pudding was the subject of a complaint of an acid metallic taste. Examination by the Public Analyst showed that the contents were adversely affected by bacteria gaining admission to the can through a defective seam and that the metallic taste was due to the by-products of bacterial growth. Informal action was taken to ensure that there would be no repetition of this incident. 37 lemon curd. A jar of lemon curd was the subject of a complaint when it was alleged that the curd was unfit for consumption. The sample was submitted to the Public Analyst who confirmed that the article had a nasty taste and a peculiar smell. The manufacturers were interviewed and the matter had not been resolved at the time of writing this report. MINCE PIE. A fragment of metal was found in a mince pie alleged to have been purchased from a bakers shop in Wimbledon. Legal proceedings were instituted against the baker who pleaded guilty and he was fined Â£10.10.0. with Â£3.3.0. costs. PORK PIE. An individual pork pie containing some foreign matter was the subject of a complaint. Upon examination by the Public Analyst the foreign matter was found to be siliceous earthy matter and animal tissue. Fibres of hemp or jute were also present. Legal proceedings were instituted against the manufacturers of the pie. The defendants pleaded guilty and were fined Â£10.0.0. with Â£5.5.0. costs. OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. (1) Four pieces of string were found embedded in a bread roll purchased from a local bakers shop. Legal proceedings were instituted and the firm was fined Â£5.0.0. with Â£3.4.0. costs. (2) Proceedings were instituted under the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations 1960 against a person in charge of a meat delivery vehicle for not wearing a clean and washable head covering whilst carrying meat from the van to a shop. The defendant was fined Â£2.0.0. with Â£2.2.0. costs. 38 SECTION F - RODENT CONTROL. PETROLEUM STORAGE. ETC. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT 1949. The table below summarises surface rodent control work which was carried out during 1962. The inspection and treatment of sewers, and of the Corporation's Depots, etc. was undertaken in collaboration with the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department. Each year 10% of the total manholes in the whole sewer system are test baited, and maintenance treatment is carried out on these, and other manholes known to be infested, twice in each year. During 1962, 124 manholes were baited and 29 showed evidence of rodent infestation. The Department continued to deal with rodent treatment and disinfestation work in Surrey County Council owned property within the Borough including schools and river banks, on a contract basis. Type of Property Number of Properties inspected as a result of:- Number of Properties found to be infested by:- Number of treatments carried out including retreatments. Number of inspections made including reinspections. Notifica tion Survey under Act.

During the year 1962, 138 complaints were received concerning insect pests, and the following is a list of the infestations dealt with:- Ants 20 Bed bugs 21 Bees 3 Beetles 14 Cockroaches 2 Fleas 2 Flies 3 Maggots 1 Mosquitoes 1 Wasps 66 Woodworm 5 The incidence of wasps was again generalised during 1962, and it is considered that the service provided by the Department in the destruction of wasps nests plays a great part in the Council's Food Hygiene Policy. In addition, 22 complaints were received regarding squirrels, pigeons and rabbits, and these were referred to the Pests Officer of the Ministry Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at Guildford. PETROLEUM (REGULATION) ACTS 1928 & 1936. 57 licences were issued by the Department to store petroleum spirit during 1962, and the total quantity of petroleum spirit stored was 114,945 gallons. In addition, 28 licences were issued to store petroleum mixtures involving a total of 12,974 gallons, and 3 licences were issued in respect of the storage of a total of 4,628 lbs of calcium carbide. 113 visits were made to premises under the provisions of Petroleum legislation. legal proceedings. Two offences relating to the storage of petroleum mixtures in excess of the permitted quantity without a licence was the subject of legal proceedings. In each case the defendants pleaded guilty and fines of Â£3.0.0. and Â£5.0.0. together with costs of Â£2.2.0. and Â£1.1.0. respectively were imposed. PET ANIMALS ACT 1951. 7 licences to keep pet shops were issued by the Department during 1962. 13 visits were made to these premises and any infringements of the conditions of licence were rectified. 40 CLEAN AIR ACT 1956 During the year 1962, 51 complaints were received with regard to smoke or grit emission, and the necessary observations were made and remedial action taken. 19 notices of proposal to instal a furnace to which Section 3(1) of the Act applied were received, and the installations were inspected and recorded. "Prior approval" under Section 3(2) of the Act was given to the installation of 2 new oil-fired furnaces during the year. In 2 instances plans which were deposited for Building Bye-law approval showed in each case the proposed construction of a chimney. After examination of the plans, followed by discussions with the applicants, opinions upon the heights of the chimneys in relation to Section 10 of the Clean Air Act 1956, were sent to the Borough Engineer and Surveyor. National Survey of Atmospheric Pollution. 5 daily smoke filter and sulphur dioxide (volumetric) instruments were sited in approved positions in the Borough during 1961 and recordings were commenced in January, 1962. These instruments, which record smoke density and sulphur dioxide content, are visited daily throughout the year, and after standardisation the recordings are sent to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and are eventually recorded in the Department's Atmospheric Pollution Bulletin, together with the results of measurements by other Local Authorities. The Council appointed the Chairman of the Health Committee and the Chief Public Health Inspector as their representatives to the Standing Conference convened by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and comprising all co-operating bodies. This conference met twice during the year. Smoke Control Areas. Progress was made during 1962 to implement the scheme which the Council approved in 1959 to enable the making of Smoke Control Orders covering the whole of the Borough. Wimbledon Smoke Control Order 1962 (No.l) was made by the Council in February, 1962, and this Order was the subject of a public enquiry. The Minister of Housing and Local Government had not published the result of the enquiry by the end of the year. (This Order was, in fact, confirmed in February, 1963). The Wimbledon Smoke Control Order 1962 (No. 2) was confirmed by the Minister in November, 1962 and this Order becomes operative on the 1st June, 1964. At the end of 1962 Smoke Control Area No. 3 was in process of survey. 41 The Council submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government a revised programme in accordance with Circular 4/1962. This new programme provides for 9 Smoke Control Areas, covering 2,479 acres to be dealt with by the end of 1966. It also provides for the target year for completion of the whole programme to be 1975 instead of 1980 as previously notified. The total number of visits made during 1962 in connection with the Clean Air Act 1956, for all purposes, was 7,315. SHOPS ACT 1950. The total number of Shops Act inspections during 1962 was 263. Sanitary accommodation and heating and ventilation of shops has been kept under observation, and any necessary action has been taken in respect of general closing hours, half-day closing and Sunday Trading. DISEASES OF ANIMALS ACTS. No outbreaks of disease occurred within the Borough during 1962. Copies of Orders made by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in respect of other outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, anthrax, swine fever and fowl pest were received. Visits were made during the year to a piggery which is licensed by the Council under the Diseases of Animals (Waste Foods) Order 1957 for the boiling of foodstuffs for the feeding of animals. NOISE ABATEMENT ACT 1960. This Act came into operation on the 27th November, 1960, and was added to the Powers and Duties of the Health Committee. During 1962, 22 complaints were received and 81 visits were made under the Act. An infringement of the Noise Abatement Act 1960 by the operation after 7 p.m. of loud-speaker chimes attached to an ice-cream vehicle was the subject of legal proceedings. The Defendant pleaded guilty and was fined Â£2.0.0. with Â£3.3.0. costs. 42 SECTION G. - PREVALENCE OF. AND CONTROL OVER. INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES During the year there were 163 cases of infectious disease notified compared with 1,064 in 1961, and 148 in 1960. The decrease was due mainly to a drop in the number of notifications of measles. The following infectious diseases are notifiable to the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough:- Smallpox Cholera Diphtheria (including Membranous Group) Erysipelas Scarlet Fever Typhus Enteric or Typhoid Fever Relapsing Fever Tuberculosis (all forms) Ophthalmia Neonatorum Malaria Dysentery Acute Primary Pneumonia Acute Influenzal Pneumonia Puerperal Pyrexia Measles Whooping Cough Meningococcal Infection Acute Poliomyelitis - Paralytic Acute Poliomyelitis - Non-Paralytic Acute Encephalitis - Infective Acute Encephalitis - Post Infectious Food Poisoning Plague Para-typhoid Fevers Anthrax. SMALLPOX No case of smallpox was notified in the Borough during the year, but tcwards the end of December, 1961 and the early part of January, 1962 a number of Pakistan immigrants who entered this country through London Airport later developed smallpox. Arising from these importations outbreaks of anallpox occurred in various parts of England and Wales on a scale unknown in this country in recent years. 43 There were some suspected contacts in Wimbledon, and these were kept under daily surveillance until the possibility of developing the disease disappeared. To meet the increased demand from the public for vaccination, existing clinic facilities were expanded to cater particularly for (a) children under the age of 5 years who had not been previously vaccinated (b) persons who believed they may have been in contact with a case of smallpox, and (c) persons who considered they were at special risk or going abroad. The supply of vaccine was adequate and general practitioners were supplied by the Public Health Department if they were experiencing difficulties in getting vaccine through their normal method of supply. Health staffs, such as Medical Officers, Health Visitors, Public Health Inspectors and Hospital Staff whose work might lead to exposure to infection, were advised of the necessity of being re-vaccinated. These outbreaks which caused the deaths of 26 persons in England and Wales drew public attention to the fact that smallpox is still prevalent in many parts of the world and constant vigilance on the part of the Public Health and Medical services is always necessary. SCARLET FEVER There were 17 cases of scarlet fever notified during 1962 compared with 30 in 1961, 45 in 1960 and 74 in 1959. None of the cases was treated in hospital. The infection continued to be of a mild type. There were no deaths from the disease. PUERPERAL PYREXIA The Puerperal Pyrexia Regulations 1951 define this illness as any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100.4ÂºF. or more has occurred within fourteen days after childbirth or miscarriage. During the year 5 notifications were received, 4 of the cases occurring in hospital and I at home. The 4 hospital notifications had addresses outside the Borough. In 1961 8 cases were notified. 44 PNEUMONIA Nino cases of acute primary or influenzal pneumonia were notified during the year, compared with 13 in 1961 and 7 in 1960. The total number of deaths from all forms of the disease during the year was 40 compared with 46 in 1961. MEASLES There were 122 cases notified during the year compared with 980 in 1961. Generally speaking the measles was mild in type with little by way of complications and no deaths. All the cases notified were treated at home. WHOOPING COUGH Only 7 cases of whooping cough were notified in 1962 compared with 27, 55, 5, 10 and 108 in the last five years. This is the second lowest number of notifications received since whooping cough became notifiable in 1940. It is most gratifying to see a fall in the number of cases of whooping cough as this is one of the most serious of childhood illnesses and immunisation of all infants against the disease is strongly recommended. Most babies are now immunised against whooping cough with a triple antigen combining whooping cough, diphtheria and tetanus and this treatment should be commenced by the third or fourth month. FOOD POISONING There was one confirmed case in a child of 22 months who was admitted to hospital following temperature and diarrhoea over a period of three weeks. Stool examination revealed that the child was infected with salmonella-typhi-murium. Specimens examined from other members of the fanily were negative. The source of the infection in this case was not discovered. DIPHTHERIA There were no cases. The present level of imnunisation is still below what is aimed at, and every effort is made through propaganda and other means to remind the public of the need for imnunisation. Throughout the country as a whole in recent years, Diphtheria has become more conmon, and it is, therefore, more important than ever that parents should have their children inmunised, and that the initial protection should be given in the first year of life. 45 MENINGOCOCCAL INFECTION One case occurred in a child of seventeen months who was admitted to hospital with initial symptoms of lassitude, high temperature and fretfulness. This was considered to be a case of meningococcal meningitis and was notified as such although this diagnosis was not confirmed by bacteriological investigation. The child made a good recovery. DYSENTERY For the second year running only one case of dysentery was notified compared with 17 in 1960, 11 in 1959 and 24 in 1958. This case was a young married woman who became ill with diarrhoea after returning from holiday in Spain. Bacteriological investigation revealed that she was infected with shigella sonnei but faeces specimens examined from other hone contacts proved negative. Every case of dysentery, and suspected case, is followed up systematically, and the importance of personal hygiene in preventing the spread of infection stressed at all times. Dysentery is generally a mild illness but will spread rapidly in nurseries and schools unless quickly checked. POLIOMYELITIS No case of poliomyelitis occurred. In the past five years there have been only 3 confirmed cases of poliomyelitis all of which occurred in unvaccinated persons. This most satisfactory state of affairs indicates how effective vaccination has proved in the control of this disease. Routine vaccination against poliomyelitis is now undertaken almost entirely with oral vaccine. A high proportion of Wimbledon children have been vaccinated against poliomyelitis. WINTER EPIDEMICS In the first week of January information was received from the local office of the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance that the percentage of new sickness benefit claims of the insured population was 225% of the average weekly figure. This figure increased to 385% of the average weekly figure for the week ending 9th January, 1962 but from the week ending 16th January there was a steady decline in new sickness benefit claims and by the end of January the position had returned to normal. 46 This heavy outbreak of illness was due to bronchitis, influenza and colds undoubtedly associated with the cold spell which occurred during January. The Schools in Wimbledon were unaffected by this outbreak of illness among the working population, in fact School attendance figures during the period in question were extremely good. CERTIFICATES OF VACCINATION AND INOCULATION In order to prevent the spread of infectious disease, certain countries require that visitors should be vaccinated or inoculated against specified diseases. International certificates have been prescribed for smallpox, yellow fever and cholera. When completed by the medical practitioner, his signature must be authenticated by the Medical Officer of Health. During the year 4343 requests were received for certificates of vaccination or inoculation to be authenticated for the purpose of travel abroad. SMALLPOX VACCINATION Every effort is made to maintain a high level of immunity to smallpox by vaccination of infants during their first two years, preferably during the second year. Smallpox vaccination is voluntary and is carried out by general practitioners or at Surrey County Council Clinics. The following shews the number of vaccinations carried out during the year:- Primary vaccinations 1405 Re-vaccinations 1448 47 WHOOPING COUGH IMMUNISATION As in the case of smallpox vaccination, immunisation against whooping cough, diphtheria, tetanus and poliomyelitis is carried out either by general practitioners or at Surrey County Council Clinics. The following figures show the number of children immunised against whooping cough and those who received reinforcing doses during the year (this includes those children who received protection with combined antigens). Number of children inmunised 810 Number of children boosted 212 DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION The following table gives details of the number of children under the age of 15, who were inmunised for the first time during the year 1962, together with those who received reinforcing doses during the years- Under 5 years 816 Between 5 and 15 years 55 Number of children given reinforcing doses during 1962 930 TETANUS IMMUNISATION Active immunisation against tetanus is available for those who desire it in the same way as other immunising procedures. Although not a conmon disease, the mortality rate is high, and immunisation is recommended. During the year 885 children received protection. 48 POLIOMYELITIS VACCINATION In February, 1962 live attenuated Poliovirus vaccine (Sabin vaccine) became available in this country for routine vaccination against Poliomyelitis. It has the advantage of being given by mouth and was first used In the clinics in Wimbledon on 31st March, 1962. The recommended course of this oral vaccine consists of three doses each of three drops, given at intervals of four to eight weeks, and a reinforcing dose is offered to all immunised children joining school. The vaccine can be administered on a lump of sugar or in syrup. Oral vaccine is available to all persons aged between six months and forty years and persons at special risk (including medical and nursing staff and pregnant women). Open clinics, where vaccination can be carried out without prior appointment, continued to be held at Amity Grove Clinic, Raynes Park and at Russell Road Clinic, Wimbledon on Saturday mornings throughout the year. The weekly Poliomyelitis clinic held on Thursday evenings at Russell Road Clinic was curtailed to a monthly clinic in September, the clinic being held on the first Thursday evening in the month until the end of the year. The following table shews the position with regard to poliomyelitis vaccination at 31.12.62:- Class Number who have received a primary course of vaccination. Children born in the years 1943 to 1962 13,060 Young persons born in the years 1933 to 1942 4,830 Others 4,388 Total 22,278 Number of persons who have received a re-inforcing injection/dose of vaccine 19,827 4,151 children between the ages of 5 and 12 years have received a fourth injection/dose. 49 NOTIFIABLE DISEASES DURING 1962 DISEASE Number of cases Notified in Various Age Groups Total Cases Notified Total Cases removed to Hospital Total Deaths.

Of the 49 additions 24 were primary notifications, 24 were transferred from other areas, and I was an un-notified death. An analysis of the notifications received is given overleaf. One hundred and fifty-nine cases were removed from the register for the following reasons:- Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M. F. M. F. Deaths from tuberculosis 2 2 - - Deaths of patients suffering from tuberculosis through other causes 8 2 1 - Recovered cases 16 13 1 2 Removals from district 47 42 13 10 73 59 15 12 New notifications of pulmonary tuberculosis amounted to 22 cases, the lowest figure recorded for Wimbledon and compares with 34 cases in 1961 and an average of 27 in the last five years. The notification rate was 0.38 per thousand of the population, the same as for England and Wales. Deaths from all forms of tuberculosis amounted to 4 compared with 3 last year giving a death rate per thousand population of 0.07 the same as for England and Wales. While fluctuations are bound to occur in dealing with relatively small numbers, on the average the local death rate tuberculosis has steadily declined, as it has nationally. The Council is responsible for rehousing, one of the most important measures in the prevention of this disease, and also for disinfection. Treatment for cases of tuberculosis is the responsibility of the Regional Hospital Board, who provide both sanatorium and dispensary treatment. Vaccination against tuberculosis with B.C.G. is offered to all school children between the ages of 13 and 14 years, and to students attending further education establishments. The object of the scheme is to provide resistance to tuberculosis during the adolescent period when children are most susceptible to the infection. The scheme is operated through the County School Health Service. 52 PUBLIC HEALTH (PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS 1925 PUBLIC HEALTH ACT 1936 (Section 172) During 1962 it did not become necessary to use the powers given under the above legislation. These powers prohibit persons suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis from entering upon employment involving the handling of milk, and the compulsory removal and detention in hospital, in certain circumstances, of persons suffering from tuberculosis. 53 TUBERCULOSIS 1962 AGE GROUPS CASES ADDED TO THE REGISTER DEATHS Primary Notifications (Form A) Cases Discovered otherwise than by Notification Total Cases added to the Register Pulmonary NonPulmon ary Pulmonary NonPulmon ary Pulmonary NonPulmon- Pulmonary NonPulmon ary Males Females Males Females Males Females Males Females Males Females Males Females Males Females Males Females Under 1 Year - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1-4 Years - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 5-9" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 10-14 " 2 - - - - - - - 2 - - - - - - - 15 - 19 " - â€” â€” â€” - 1 - - - 1 - - - 2 - - 20 - 24 " 2 â€” 1 â€” 2 â€” - - 4 - - 1 - - - - 25-29 " 1 - - - 1 2 2 - 2 2 2 - - - - - 30 - 34 " â€” â€” â€” - 3 1 â€” â€” 3 1 â€” - - - - - 35 - 44 " 1 2 - - 3 4 - - 4 6 - - 1 - - - 45-54 " 4 2 â€” â€” 3 - - - 7 2 - - 2 - - - 55 - 64 " 3 - - - 1 1 - - 4 1 - 2 - - - 65 and Over 3 2 - 1 - - - - 3 2 - 1 5 2 1 - Age not known - - - - 1 - - - 1 - - - - - - - 16 6 1 1 14 9 2 - 30 15 2 2 10 4 1 - 22 2 23 2 / 45 4 14 1 24 25 49 15 54 TUBERCULOSIS: The following table shows the number and types of cases on the register at December 31st for the last 10 years.
