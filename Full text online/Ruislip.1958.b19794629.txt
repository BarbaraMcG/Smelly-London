The vital statistics set out in the following pages need little comment, and may be regarded as satisfactory. 1958 was not a 'measles' year - 327 notified cases compared with 887 the previous year - and there were no deaths from any of the comnon infectious diseases. 1958, although unremarkable as far as the infectious disease incidence is concerned, is noteworthy in ahother respects During this year, widespread inoculation against poliomyelitis was begun, confined at first to a young age group, but later extended to include older children and young adults. If the results of this inoculation campaign reach expectations, leading to the virtual elimination of poliomyelitis, then 1958 will become one of the landmarks of public health progress, comparable with the action taken against diphtheria almost 20 years ago. This addition to the range of infectious diseases controllable by inoculation complicates still further the problem of getting parents to accept these procedures, especially when the diseases against which they are aimed appear to be non-existent. Fortunately, there is some prospect that in the foreseeable future, combined vaccines will be developed which will cut down t.he number of injections to be given, while at the same time providing enhanced protection. The low infant mortality rate is gratifying, although it should be remembered that the figures involved are comparatively small, and the local rate, therefore, is liable to wide fluctuations from year to year. In general, however, the trend is slowly downwards, reaching towards the hard core of those cases the cause of which is not yet fully known - the malformations, the congenital diseases and cases of prematurity. These conditions are the very ones which provide most of the cases of still birth, and early infantile mortality and still birth may conveniently be investigated together, as it is often just a matter of chance whether an infant, suffering from one of these conditions, dies before, during, or soon after birth. Much research is still needed into these conditions before it will be possible to reduce the infant mortality rate and the still birth rate much lower. 2 It is encouraging to notice the increasing interest being, taken into the question of preventing accidents in the home. Home accidents are now a major cause of disability and indeed of death, especially in the very young and the very old,, and anything that can be done to reduce this hazard is more than welcome. Manufacturers are at last realising that 'safety' is a selling point, and home appliances now being placed, on the market show a great improvement over those formerly offered. The development of non inflammable fabrics is proceeding, and this is a most encouraging feature, especially now that some of the larger manufacturers are becoming interested. In the matter of food hygiene also, it is encouraging to find an ever increasing interest. The food traders themselves are now very well aware of the legal requirements, and there is increasing interest among consumers, although many of the latter do not take sufficient care after the food purchase has been made. To be really effective, this business of food hygiene must be continuous right up to the time the food is actually consumed and neither manufacturer, retailer nor consumer can depend on the other but each must play his part. It is a pleasure to record how much support and co-operation I have had from the Public Health Department as a whole and from Mr. E. H. Jenkins, the Chief Public Health Inspector, in particular. The willing assistance and encouragement of the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee also has been most valuable, and has led in no small way to the smooth manner in which the year's work has been accomplished. I am, Your obedient Servant, 0. C. DOBSON, Medical Officer of Health. 3 STATISTICS TOTAL AREA OF DISTRICT 6,583 acres.

Proceedings were instituted against each trader; one was fined Â£3, the other was fined Â£5, and each was ordered to pay 1 guinea costs. Sugar Confectionery: A sample of Coffee Fudge was found to be labelled with misleading statements as to the presence of vitamins. Fudge Rum was found to contain no proof spirit. A letter of caution was sent to each of the manufacturers concerned. Another trader supplied a sponge cake filled with imitation cream in response to a request for Cream Sponge; this request was prompted by the manner in which these cakes were labelled when exposed for sale. Proceedings were instituted and the trader was fined Â£5 and ordered to pay 4 guinea costs. Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887 - 1953 The majority of the inspection work carried out under the provisions of the above Acts relates to ensuring that the requirements of the various Marking Orders made under the provisions of the Act of 1926, and which relate to the marking with an indication of origin of certain imported foodstuffs when exposed for sale or sold, are complied with. Inspections were made at 195 separate premises of 798 displays of meat, apples, tomatoes, poultry, dried fruit, and butter. One trader was prosecuted for exposing for sale imported fresh apples not marked with an indication of origin; a fine of Â£1 was imposed. Labelling of Food Order, 1953: This Order requires pre-packed food to be marked with the name and address, or with the registered trade mark, of the packer or labeller. It also requires such food to be labelled with its common or usual name (if any) and with the names of the ingredients of a compounded food. It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed and prescribes specific labelling of certain foods. A total of 213 articles of pre-packed food was examined at 55 premises to ascertain whether the above requirements were complied with; no serious infringements of this Order were detected. False or Misleading Descriptions: As in previous years food advertisements and labels have been scrutinised for false or misleading statements and descriptions. Much of this scrutiny of food labels can be combined with inspection work under the Labelling of Food Order. No serious infringements were disclosed. Corrective action was secured in relation to descriptions applied to "Milk Block", "Double Tea", an imitation cream powder, cakes filled with a mixture of butter and sugar, canned mixed vegetables raspberry syrup, powdered soup mixes, medium red salmon, gorgonzola cheese spread and cheese spread.
