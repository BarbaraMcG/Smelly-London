To the Chairman and Members of the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Apart from the expected increase in the incidence of measles the year has been comparatively uneventful, and there has been no happening worthy of special note. Once again, there has been no case of diphtheria, and once again no case of poliomyelitis. This is a great encouragement to those working in Public Health and Preventive Medicine as the absence of these diseases is a measure of the success achieved. In this work, no news is good news, but the success achieved in itself causes more difficulty, as it becomes more and more difficult to get people to accept measures to protect them against diseases which to them are apparently non-existent. It is usual for infants to be offered protection against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, poliomyelitis and smallpox. The present tendency is to combine as many of these as possible, so that the number of injections required is cut down to the minimum. The development of a poliomyelitis vaccine which can be taken by the mouth is a great step forward and this material has now an appropriate place in the schedule of immunisation procedures. The continued success of the immunisation programme depends not only on the giving of theinitial series of immunisations, but also on the proper spacing of the boost procedures. The closure of infectious diseases hospitals and wards up and down the country over the last few years is perhaps the greatest single tribute to the work that has been done in the control of infectious diseases. The infant mortality rate (17. 56) is slightly down on that for the previous year, and is below the national figure (21.4) which is itself the lowest national rate ever recorded. The causes of the infant deaths are set out in the body of the report, and it will be seen that they represent a hard core of conditions which are, as yet, not fully understood, and therefore not preventable. Much research work is still being carried out all over the world into this aspect of infant mortality, but it is a very difficult subject and the results are slow to develop. Heart and arterial diseases and cancer are the conditions responsible for the majority of adult deaths - infections are no longer a problem in this connection, as they are comparatively easily controlled by the modern antibiotic drugs. Here, again, intensive research work is 2 proceeding, and it may be that in the future - whether near or distant no one can tell the causes of both heart and arterial disease and cancer will be discovered and then the appropriate preventive measures can be applied. Cancer of the lung continues to increase in incidence, and the connection between this and heavy cigarette smoking has been so thoroughly demonstrated that the remedial measure is obvious - this can only be applied by the individual himself. Mr. Jenkins, the Chief Public Health Inspector and his colleagues have carried out their many tasks with their usual efficiency throughout the year and to them I express my gratitude for their willing co-operation at all times. Their work is summarised in the body of the report, and some idea will be gained of the immense variety and scope of the duties of a Public Health Inspector today. As indicated above, the almost complete lack of noteworthy incident is itself the measure of the success achieved - public health is only news when the various procedures normally used fail in some degree or other. As always, the work of the Department has been made much easier and more interesting because of the help and understanding of the Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee; it is encouraging to feel that this support is there, and that the proper measures to safeguard the Public Health will be taken. I am, Your obedient Servant, O. C. DOBSON, Medical Officer of Health. 3 STATISTICS TOTAL AREA OF DISTRICT 6, 583 acres.

O'Keefe, Chief Officer, Public Control Department, Middlesex County Council. ARTICLE TOTAL SAMPLES PROCURED UNSATISFACTORY Milk (various) 90 1 Butter 20 _ Cream 10 _ Cheese 5 - Drugs 17 - Fish and Fish Products 4 - Fruit (fresh) 3 - 27 ARTICLE TOTAL SAMPLES PROCURED UNSATISFACTORY Fruit (dried) 4 - Ice Cream 20 - Liver 10 - Margarine 11 - Meat and meat products 39 - Sausages and sausage meat 6 - Sweets 5 - Vinegar 22 - Miscellaneous 11 - TOTALS 277 1 The following information is given with reference to the unsatisfactory samples: - "The only unsatisfactory sample procured in the Ruislip-Northwood area during the year under consideration was one of milk in a third of a pint bottle which was delivered to a school for cunsumption by a pupil. After drinking part of the milk through a straw the pupil complained to the teacher that he had sucked glass into his mouth through the straw. On examination of the remains of the milk by one of the officers of my Department it was found that there were about 30 small pieces of glass in the bottle. The seller was prosecuted and fined £20 and was ordered to pay 5 guineas towards the costs. Many of the samples procured in the county of Middlesex have the effect of protecting the residents of Ruislip-Northwood although the samples may not necessarily have originated within the district. Such an instance was a case where a sample of pumpernickel and a sample of sliced smoked saithe were both found to contain a preservative not permitted in this country although allowed in Germany where both the samples were packed. The importer was aware of the position and was prosecuted and fined £20 and ordered to pay 12 guineas towards the cost. In all 60 samples of fruit and vegetables were procured in the county and tested for the presence of toxic metals. All were within the accepted limit for copper and all were free from arsenic. MERCHANDISE MARKS ACTS, 1887 to 1953 Inspections are carried out under the above Acts to ensure that the requirements of the various Marking Orders relating to the indication of origin on imported foodstuffs are applied. Inspections were made at 102 premises and a total of 295 displays were examined. 5 infringments were reported. Four traders were cautioned and one was prosecuted, the prosecution being for labelling and selling Dutch tomatoes as English, The retailer wa6 fined £5 on each of 3 summonses and ordered to pay 3 guineas costs. THE LABELLING OF FOOD ORDER, 1953 The Labelling of Food Order requires a pre-packed food to be marked with the name and address of the packer or labeller, or to bear a registered trade mark; to be marked with 28 its common or usual name, and to bear a statement of ingredients if the food consists of more than one ingredient. It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed.; In Ruislip-Northwood, a total of 57 premises were visited and 323 items of food were examined for compliance with the Order. No infringements were reported as a result of these inspections. SAFE MILK Three samples of raw milk were procured in Ruislip-Northwood and were tested for the presence of tubercle baccilli. None was found to be contaminated. 46 samples of milk were procured and tested to ascertain whether pasteurisation or sterilisation had been properly carried out. None of the samples failed the tests. 8 inspections of a milk pasteurising plant in Ruislip-Northwood were made to ensure the proper handling and processing of the milk. LABELLING AND ADVERTISING INFRINGEMENTS In addition to the detail given above, a considerable volume of work was done in the period under review, which did not arise from samples procured in the area of RuislipNorthwood, but which had the effect of protecting the residents in each county district. The matters dealt with were in respect of nationally retailed articles of food. Several manufacturers were required to designate the ingredients on labels of Instant Coffee. As a result of a complaint of the taste of a soft drink, investigations made in my Department showed that there was phenolic contamination which arose from a chemical reaction between chlorinated water and the phenol formaldehyde stopper. The manufacturer has modified the ingredients of this product to prevent the chemical reaction. The manufacturer of a non-alcoholic wine was challenged on the ground that the description was a contradiction in terms, and the label was amended to 'non-alcoholic beverage'. The importer of a slimming food was challenged on claims made in advertising literature as to the Vitamin concentration, and the literature was corrected. A manufacturer's claim of slimming properties for "reducing perles" was challenged and the product withdrawn. The claim relied on the presence of purgatives and bladderwrack. The slimming claims made for a lemon juice in a television advertisement were modified after the manufacturer had been challenged as to the efficiency of the product as a slimming agent. Modification to the labels of several brands of canned chicken were secured, where it was not apparent from the label that the contents of the cans were not solely chicken, but chicken in jelly or broth. " 29 ICE CREAM There are in the District one hundred and eleven premises registered for the sale of ice cream and one for the manufacture of ice cream. Sixty samples were taken during the year for examination by the Methylene Blue Test, These were placed in the following grades:- Grade 1 30 Grade III 4 Grade II 18 Grade IV 8 Samples of ice cream for Chemical Analysis are taken by the sampling officers of the Middlesex County Council. PET SHOPS There are 5 premises licensed under the Pet Animals Act, 1951. They were visited and inspected during the year and found to be maintained in a satisfactory condition. FOOD POISONING There was no serious outbreak of food poisoning in this District during 1961.
