General Report of Works executed by THE VESTRY OF ST. JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER, IN THE YEAR 1861-62. b To the Vestry of St. James's, Westminster. June 1862. Gentlemen, In presenting a short Annual Report of the Works executed in the departments with which I have the honour to be connected, I begin to find a difficulty presents itself in the shape of a gradual diminution of what may be called Special Works, and a more than corresponding increase of what may be termed Routine Work; to attempt to report the latter would be almost absurd, as a moderately sized volume might be filled without any difficulty. The short lists that accompany this will shew that very little has apparently been done with regard to paving matters, though my fortnightly reports sometimes give a very long list of repairs and trenches made good, which in reality constitute the chief duty of the Vestry with regard to paving operations as I understand it, being more to maintain the various carriage and footways than to construct Xll new ones; and although the openings made by Gas and Water Companies are in themselves one great cause of dilapidation in roadways, it is astonishing how long some apparently defective work may be made to last with care and tolerably constant attendance, and it is to this preservation of existing paved surfaces that I direct my attention as far as possible, never suggesting even a re-lay, let alone re-paving with new stone, until it is evident that that previously existing is no longer trustworthy; and I am induced, as far as practicable to adopt and recommend this course, though more troublesome to myself, from the great cost of paving works generally, especially where new material is required. It will be seen that the Vestry have executed no works of magnitude with the exception of substituting McAdam for pitched paving in Tichborne Street, and re-laying a portion of the upper part of the Haymarket, where the existing granite cubes were replaced by some in store in the Stone Yard, at a trifling expense. The time of the small number of men permanently employed by the Vestry (and in my opinion the fewer the better,) has been absorbed in repairs and in making good the paving where disturbed by the Gas or Water Companies, or private individuals from any cause, a considerable portion of the money so expended by the Vestry being in various ways reimbursed. xiii SEWERS. Under the item of Sewers Works I have no new works to record; of course it would hardly be allowable to report that the condition of the local sewers is perfect, but I think the Vestry may on the whole congratulate themselves on the fact that the state of the sewerage in St. James's, Westminster, is in a tolerably complete state, and very little has been required to be expended during the last twelve months under this head, in fact one dilapidated sewer in New Burlington Street forms almost the only definite item; a great deal has been done in cleansing both gullies and sewers, in fact at least two men are always employed in this duty and rendering such assistance in cleansing and freeing private drains from obstructions as they can; this latter duty is a great boon to the ratepayers, not to be appreciated except by an individual who experiences the annoyance of living in a house where the drain is stopped. These two men are also useful in letting off the water from street gullies and urinals when they happen from any cause to become choked. The main difficulty with regard to sewerage works still exists, that is the ventilation, not only is air requisite for men to be enabled to work, but the most important part, namely, the generating of various foul gases still remains to be satisfactorily dealt with. These gases will generate and will find their wav somewhere; if confined in the sewer they xiv will force their way into private houses through the drains or even brickwork, and prove more disastrous in their results than the openings in the street or even through gullies. I trust,—hoping almost against hope,—that before this time next year some individual more ingenious than myself (and I have exhausted my invention in futile schemes), will contrive some means of obviating this unfortunately increasing evil; but I am afraid that it will only be overcome by the aid of chemistry; I am not at all sure that the plan of increasing the number of ventilating gratings would not lessen it, but as the result is doubtful and the experiment itself attended with difficulty and considerable expense, I do not find myself justified in advising the Vestry to adopt this course. As last year and previously it will be seen that the subject of Public Urinals has received considerable attention at the hands of the Vestry, but more especially of the Works Committee, who have done their utmost to face and deal with this most delicate subject, but as important as it is, necessarily kept rather in the background; the main difficulty in the St. James's District is the selection of sites which shall combine apparent impossibilities, namely, conspicuousness and invisibility, they should be unmistakeable and unobjectionable, and there is no doubt that fifty new ones might have been constructed with less trouble and care than has been bestowed by the Works Committee in attempting to XV render those that still exist as little annoyance to the neighbourhood as is consistent with their usefulness. As in the case of sewer ventilation, there is a wide field for ingenuity and invention in this branch of the duties of the Vestry, but I am afraid that the inventive powers of any individual will be taxed to the utmost to suggest unobjectionable sites in the Parish of St. James's, Westminster, although I am induced to mention it for the purpose of bearing record which may some day be useful, that the subject has received a great amount of attention ; further and tolerably full particulars of which may be gathered from the minutes of the proceedings of the Works Committee. It would be superfluous to attempt to report the time and attention that has been bestowed upon the subject of Private Lamps and Projections, as it will be in the recollection of all interested in the subject that it has engaged a great deal of the time and attention of the Vestry, and much more of the Works Committee ; it will be sufficient to state that perhaps the best course that could be adopted is now followed, that is, simply to deal with individual cases upon their respective merits, general rules having been found upon careful consideration to be inapplicable. The most important work of the Vestry during the past twelvemonth has undoubtedly been the erection of the New Vestry Hall and Offices on the site of the previous Vestry Room in Piccadilly, and now approaching completion. All the preliminary xvi arrangements and the reports of the Rates Collection Committee from time to time, have been so constantly before the Vestry, that I cannot add much to the information already procured. The object of the building has been so often explained and so generally understood, and so ably detailed in the reports of the Committee alluded to, that it would be out of place for me to attempt to make it any clearer, so I will content myself with a mere statement of the accommodation provided and the general capabilities of the building. As it is not yet quite completed I cannot state the exact cost, many small matters still requiring to be performed to make it as complete as the Vestry would probably desire. Basement.

I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Yours most obediently, A. P. HOWELL. c xviii PAYING WORKS, &c. EXECUTED BY The Vestry of St. James's, Westminster, from 25th March, 1861, to 25th March, 1862.

JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER; SCIENTIFIC SUPERINTENDENT AT THE SOUTH KENSINGTON MUSEUM. TO THE VESTRY OF The Parish of St. James's, Westminster. —♦— Reverend Sir, My Lord, and Gentlemen, I have the honour to lay before you the Annual Table of the Causes of Death in the Parish during the year 1861, also to present you with a Report of the work of the Sanitary Inspector during the same year. Although such tables and reports speak for themselves, I avail myself of your permission to make those remarks which a comparison between the results of this and previous years seem to demand. THE CENSUS. Previous, however, to making any reference to the tables at present, I would call your attention to the results of the Census which was completed in the year 1861. I should have been glad if I could have presented you with a more complete comparison between the state of your population in 1851 and 1861, but at present I have been prevented from doing so by the fact that the Registrar-General is still engaged in reducing the returns made in 1861 4 for the publication of his detailed report of the Census. I am however enabled to supply you with a certain number of facts, which will, I am sure, be acceptable to all who take an interest in the welfare of the parish. The population of the parish of St. James's, Westminster, in 1851, was 36,406 In the year 1861 it was 35,324 Thus shewing a decrease in the population of 1,082 The bulk of this decrease has not fallen on the over-crowded populations of the Berwick Street and Golden Square Districts, but on the wealthy and comparatively thinly populated district of St. James's Square. The precise figures as obtained from the Census returns are as follows:— St. James's Square Division. Population in 1851, 11,469 Ditto in 1861, 10,753 Diminution, 716 Golden Square Division. Population in 1851, 14,139 Ditto in 1861, 13,963 Diminution, 176 5 Berwick Street Division. Population in 1851, 10,798 Ditto in 1861, 10,608 Diminution, 190 Although for the sake of the health, comfort, and morality of the parish, it might have been wished that the diminution had taken place in the Golden Square and more especially in the Berwick Street Divisions, it is nevertheless an interesting fact to me to know that the great diminution which has taken place in the mortality of the parish has been in the Golden Square and Berwick Street Districts, to which more particularly I have directed attention in putting sanitary measures in force. An examination of the abstracts politely supplied by the Registrar-General, afford some further interesting details with regard to the population and condition of the parish. Thus I find that in 1861 the number of females in excess of males was 2,098. This number was distributed in the three divisions of the parish and the Workhouse as follows:— St. James's Square Division, 591 Golden Square Division, 1,146 Workhouse, 115 Berwick Street Division, 246 2,098 It is worthy of note that the disproportion is least 6 in the poorest district of the parish and greatest in the wealthier and less crowded districts. The number of houses in the parish is 3,516. They are distributed as follows:— St. James's Square Division, 1,505 Golden Square Division, 1,238 Berwick Street Division, 773 3,516 The number uninhabited on the day on which the Census was taken was 236. They were in each division as follows:— St. James's Square Division, 124 Golden Square Division, 62 Berwick Street Division, 50 236 The number of families in the parish is 7,924. Of these, the proportion that reside in a single house is one and a half in each house, or three families for every two houses in St. James's Square Division; two and a half families for each house, or five families in every two houses in the Golden Square Division; and three families for every house in the Berwick Street Division. The families of the wealthier inhabitants of Golden Square are on an average but four in number, whilst the less opulent inhabitants of the Berwick Street Division is under five. There are seven persons living on an average 7 in each house in the St. James's Square Division; there are ten in each house in the Golden Square Division, but there are thirteen in each house in the Berwick Street Division. It is by the light of such facts as these that we may read the causes of the death and disease, if not even the immorality of the poorer district. In the Berwick Street Division too, I would call to your mind the fact that the houses are much smaller, so that it is not unfrequently the case that families are crowded together into a space totally inadequate to the maintenance of healthy life. There are 430 persons living on an average in each acre of the Berwick Street Division, whilst in the Golden Square Division there are but 260, and in the St. James's Square Division 130. Such are some of the facts which the Census brings to light, and I propose in a future Report to lay before you more minutely the arrangements for living which are made in this parish, whose physical well-being the legislature expects you to superintend and to some extent even answer for. In each division of the parish there are spots, where the population is denser than the vicinity, and it is these spots in which disease is most rife, and death most frequent, and whose population must be watched most constantly if disease is to be arrested and life to be saved. MORTALITY OF 1861. From an examination of the Tables of Mortality it will be found that the number of deaths in 1861 was 758. This mortality exceeds by thirty-three 8 the mortality of 1860, but does not reach the mortality of 1859. Compared with the five preceding years it presents a larger mortality than any year except 1859. It is still, however, forty-two below the average of death of the parish in the ten years preceding the introduction of active sanitary measures. ZYMOTIC DISEASE. In examining the Tables of Mortality for the purpose of ascertaining to what classes of disease the higher mortality is due, we are at once struck with the fact that the class of zymotic diseases have been unusually fatal. The following Table will shew the number and nature of these diseases in each division of the parish:— 1861. Names of Diseases. St. James's Square. Golden Square. Berwick Street. Total. Small Pox .. 1 1 Measles 4 ft 10 19 Scarlet Fever & Diphtheria 11 9 12 32 Hooping Cough 5 11 31 47 Diarrhœa 2 2 6 10 Typhus and Typhoid 1 1 • • 2 Total 23 29 59 111 The average death from these diseases in the parish during the last six years has been ninety-six, so that the number this year is fifteen above the average. The increase has been chiefly with scarlet fever and hooping cough. 9 The spread of these diseases might be much prevented if the members of infected families were more careful in avoiding contact with non-infected persons. It is very common for persons having a child or children ill with scarlet fever to send the children not attacked to school, the consequence is that the children carry the poison in their clothes and infect children who are more susceptible of the disease than themselves. In a large number of cases of scarlet fever which I have investigated during the year for the purpose of ascertaining where the disease has come from, I could trace it to no other source than the school. Number of Cases of Scarlatina traced to Schools and other places. National School, Marshall Street, 5 St. Luke's School, under the Church in Berwick Street, 2 A School at No. 4, Upper Rupert Street, 1 Scotch School, Swallow Street, 2 St. Luke's School, Peter Street, 3 Dufour's Place School, 2 A School at 40 a, Rupert Street, 4 However carefully schools are ventilated, and however large they are for the number of scholars, nothing short of excluding the children of infected families, can arrest this disease. At the same time I believe that the less ventilated and the more crowded schoolrooms are, the more likely are the 10 children to take the infection one from the other. I think that more active means might be taken in our various schools for the exclusion of the children of infected families. The same remarks apply to the infection of hooping cough as to that of scarlet fever, but persons are much less careful in guarding against hooping cough than scarlet fever, and consequently the mortality is much greater. This disease is also greatly propagated by the injudicious admission of children with hooping cough into schools. Where children are ill with hooping cough the crowded schoolroom is almost the worse place they can be sent to. The evil effects of overcrowding on this disease may be seen by the fact that the mortality from this disease is greatest in the most crowded districts. Thus of forty-seven cases during the past year, thirty-one occurred in the Berwick Street Division. It is gratifying to find but one case of small pox recorded. This is by no means, however, the result of increased attention to vaccination, as no active measures have been taken for putting the provisions of the Public Vaccination Act in force in this parish. Nothing short of active superintendence can overcome the indifference of the population to their physical welfare. It is only when disease is present in their homes or death has bereaved them of their loved ones, that they become alive to the necessity of preventing disease. The legislature has, however, placed sufficient powers in the hands of local authorities for preventing this disease, and 11 in this as in all other cases it seems to me that they incur a very solemn responsibility in neglecting those precautions which have been so often urged upon them. MORTALITY IN THE DIFFERENT DIVISIONS OF THE PARISH. / I take this opportunity of presenting you with a series of Tables which by a little examination will at once indicate where the great weight of mortality presses. You will see here that with little variation the greatest amount of death falls on the most populous district, whilst the least amount occurs in the most thinly populated district. I would especially call attention to the difference between the mortality of the Berwick Street Division and that of the St. James's Square Division. Although the population is nearly the same, in some years the death has been nearly double in the one case what it is in the other. I.—ST. JAMES'S DIVISION. Population in 1861, 10,753.

Whilst every year I have to record that nearly 100 children have been carried off in the parish, here is an institution in which upwards of 150 children have been reared and educated for ten years without a single death from zymotic disease at all. During the ten years of its existence, only seven children have died in these schools, and these seven were more or less sickly at the time of their admission. It should be also recollected that the children admitted into these schools have been already exposed to influences of the worst possible kind. Many of them are orphans, whilst others are the offspring of the diseased, the destitute, and the depraved. Yet we find that such children are no sooner exposed to the beneficial influence of nutritious diet, pure air, and regular exercise, than they acquire a state of health that is not equalled by the children of the most opulent in the healthiest district of the parish. I think this is a lesson that should be well pondered by the proprietors and directors of our public schools which are confined to the densely populated districts of the Metropolis. Whatever may be the advantages of their present position it should be well considered 14 whether the advantages are of a kind to be set against life and robust health. MODEL LODGING HOUSES. As bearing on this subject I may refer to the much smaller amount of mortality that occurs in the Model Lodging Houses, Ingestre Buildings, than in the surrounding streets. I do not consider that these lodging houses are faultless, but as compared with the lodgings in the neighbouring streets, their superiority is seen in the greater amount of health and freedom from mortality which distinguishes their inhabitants. In the immediate neighbourhood of these buildings are some of the most degraded dwelling places in the parish, and I am glad to know that efforts are being made to secure these, for the purpose of building upon their site a new block of improved lodging houses. I would especially urge on all those interested in the sanitary welfare of their poorer fellow-parishioners, the importance of encouraging by every means in their power the residences of the various working classes, who get their living in the parish. By the construction of large, well ventilated buildings in which the working man could find at the price he ought to pay, the comforts of an Englishman's home, not only would the health of the parish be improved, but the rates would be diminished, or, at least, the ability to pay rates would be increased, and the morals of the population would be improved. However, desirable 15 it may be that the working man should have his home in the suburbs, I am convinced that a profitable investment of capital may be made even in our wealthier districts, by the erection of properly constructed lodging houses. Beneficial as may be the action which results from the sanitary claims of the Metropolitan Management Act, from the Nuisances Removal Act, and other wise Legislature Measures, it too often happens that all the efforts of the Medical Officer of Health fail to make many of the residences of the poor either healthful or decent. One of the great evils which most of the cities of Europe have to contend with, and which is especially rife in certain parts of our parish is, that the houses in which the poor live have not been constructed to meet the wants, comfort, convenience, or health of their families. The great majority of the working classes of this parish do not live in houses, but in parts of houses, which have been constructed only for single families. Parts of houses which ought to be confined to the members of a single family are common, and this conversion of houses intended for single families into the residence of several, is a fertile source of the breaking down of those barriers of decency and propriety which are the great safeguards of honor and morality. This close association of several families in one house is productive of immense evil; it prevents proper parental control; it encourages an association of the sexes, which leads directly to one of our greatest social evils; and is one of the most fruitful 16 causes of the spread and fatality of zymotic diseases of childhood, and lays the foundation of the scrofula and consumption which every year carry off a fifth of all who die amongst us. It is for these reasons that I would earnestly urge upon the Vestry, the Clergy, and all who are interested in the welfare of the parish, the importance of assisting in carrying out the plans which are now in agitation for improving the dwellings of the poor. SANITARY WORK OF THE YEAR 1861. I call your attention to the Reports of the Sanitary Inspector as indicating the amount of work done under my direction. An examination of these Reports will shew you what a large amount of beneficial action is going on, and that even if no life had been spared and no sickness prevented, that habits and morals must have been greatly improved. It is almost impossible amidst the filth and stench of dirty houses and imperfect drains, that the working man's family should be able to develope those moral and intellectual qualities which are after all more worth to the community than any saving of rates. During the year 1861, 1574 nuisances of various kinds were removed. Without referring to these in detail, as I have done in previous years, I would draw your attention to the fact that it includes the following items:— 1. The draining anew thirty-two dwelling 17 houses with 9 and 6-inch drain-pipes, and 5 stables with 6-inch pipes. A detailed account of these cases is to be seen in the Report on the drains. 2. The visits by the Inspector to 3738 houses. These houses are either visited in turn, or as the result of complaints registered at the office, or from the information obtained by the returns from the Parish Medical Officers or the Dispensary. 3. The repairing, cleansing, and putting in proper repair and order 256 water closets. How great the relief thus afforded I need not minutely point out. The dirt and filth of the common privies or closets in the densely populated houses of streets is one of the greatest grievances of the decent poor, and is a nuisance that can only be remedied by constant inspection and superintendence. 4. The lime-whiting of 65 yards, 137 rooms, 71 kitchens and basements, and 16 walls of courts, 29 passages, and 38 stairs. By these inexpensive operations a vast amount of good has been effected. A clean wall and ceiling engenders a sympathy with cleanliness which has had the happiest effect. I confidently appeal to those who knew the parish six years ago as to the great improvement B 18 there is in the cleanliness of the great majority of the dwellings of the poor between now and then. 5. Thirteen new dustbins have been constructed, and 125 have been cleansed and put in repair. 6. Twenty-three cesspools have been emptied and filled up. 7. Twenty-five cisterns or water butts have been cleansed out or repaired. I would here observe on the very general neglect of cleansing cisterns and water butts. However good the water supplied there will necessarily be an accumulation of organic matter at the bottom, and if this is not occasionally cleared out, the water becomes foul, and is a source of disease. I would especially call attention to the fact that the nuisances which are removed are constantly recurring. It is only by constant inspection and by supervision, repeated systematically from day to day and week to week, that those nuisances can be kept down, which are ever ready to destroy the life, and, at one and the same time, sap the health and undermine the morality of the community. The disarrangement of matter, which constitutes dirt, is of hourly occurrence wherever human beings are found; and unless there is intelligence and assistance ever ready to adjust the disturbance, 19 the penalty of broken laws must be paid. The existence of dirt is evidently in the eye of the Creator a great offence, as everywhere we find its existence visited with the severest punishments that natural law can inflict. It is as much the duty of the Christian to enable his destitute neighbour to live in accordance with the laws of the Almighty, as it is to live himself obedient to the same laws. UNWHOLESOME FOOD. The legislature, by "The Nuisances Removal "Act," and "The Act for the Prevention of "the Adulteration of Articles of Food or Drink," has placed in the hands of the local authorities the power, to a very considerable extent, of preventing the sale of unwholesome food. Under the clauses of these Acts I have from time to time recommended that action should be taken. I have myself examined the meat exposed in the butchers' shops and in the public markets of the parish, and have reason to believe, that on the whole, a very small portion of the articles of animal diet sold in the parish is of an unwholesome or prejudicial nature. Wherever suspicion has arisen I have found the tradespeople in possession of the suspected article very ready to sacrifice it for the public good. MILK. I have from time to time examined the milk sold, 20 and although much of it is obtained from cows stallfed in the parish, I have failed to detect diseased products in the milk. I have often expressed my conviction that the milk of cows fed in the midst of a city is not so good as that brought from the country; but I am bound to say, that the cow-keepers of this parish have ever shewn a readiness to attend to any suggestions by which the enormous nuisance, produced by their presence in an overcrowded population, may be mitigated. I trust that now that the legislature has entrusted the local authorities with the power of licensing cow-houses, that some of the more oppressive of these nuisances will be dealt with in our parish. Some of our cow-houses, as those of Marshall Street and New Street, and which I have so often presented as nuisances to be dealt with by authority, should bo at once, and for ever suppressed. Not only have they been shown to be constantly recurring sources of immediate disease, but the injury they do to property in their immediate neighbourhood is immense, and no more fruitful source of increasing the poverty of the parish exists than these nuisances. BREAD. I have paid considerable attention to the nature of the bread sold in the parish. Whilst in some instances I have found indications of the presence of adulteration, I believe on the whole that the 21 bread sold in the parish is free from adulteration. In the course of the year I have had every bakehouse in the parish visited. An inspection was made of 45 bakehouses, and in no case was any complaint made by the men working in them, of a want of attention to their comfort and convenience. With few exceptions they were all well ventilated, and when any defect or nuisance existed the proprietor shewed the utmost readiness to remedy the inconvenience. I shall not pretend here to enter upon the question of the comparative healthfullness of machine-made or hand-made bread. I may express my conviction, that in your parish the great mass of the bread sold to the people is made with as much attention to cleanliness and purity as is consistent with the process by which the bread is made, and the places devoted to its manufacture. Had I discovered any of the bakehouses in a condition in which the law would have permitted interference, I should not have hesitated to have obtained your sanction for the adoption of compulsory measures. GROCERIES AND OTHER ARTICLES OF FOOD. Almost every article of food consumed by the community is exposed to adulteration of one kind or the other. To meet this wholesale robbery of the community, the Adulteration of Food Act was passed; but arising from the want of public spirit 22 on the part of those to whom the power of carrying out this Act was entrusted, it has hitherto been a dead letter. I have been called on in a few instances to exercise my office as Food Analyst in this parish. In one instance I was able to defend a wholesale dealer from the charge of adulteration brought against him. In other instances I have detected adulterations in various articles exposed for sale to a considerable extent. It is not however by the casual knowledge of a limited number of individuals of the existence of means to suppress adulteration, that the evil is to be suppressed, but by the determination of Vestries and Local Boards to institute rigid inquiries into the nature of all articles of food sold to the public, that much good can be expected to be done. I have thus commented on the principal subjects that have occupied my attention in the year 1861. There are many others to which I might allude, that I have brought before your attention in previous years, which have formed the subjects of my fortnightly reports. Each day and every season of the year brings with it matters requiring peculiar attention, of which you have the record in the Sanitary Inspector's diary of work, and my reports. What I am most anxious to impress upon your minds is that although much has been done, much remains to be done, and that every relaxation in the systematic efforts now being made for the removal of disease, must be attended with an increase of death and disease. To maintain the present standard of 23 health every effort must be continued, or the parish may again sink into the condition in which it became the prey of pestilence, and had to pay in the death of its community, the penalty of disregard of those laws by which the Creator governs the life of the world.
