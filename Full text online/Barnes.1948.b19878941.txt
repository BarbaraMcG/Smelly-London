To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Barnes. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my first Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health of the Borough of Barnes on the health of the Borough during 1948. Throughout 1948 I continued as Acting Medical Officer of Health, pending a decision between the County and the Borough Councils as to the best arrangement for the fulfilment of both County and Borough Councils' work. Eventually it was decided I be appointed Medical Officer to the Barnes Borough Council while remaining a County Officer, being seconded to the Borough Council for my duties to that authority as Medical Officer of Health. I have now, therefore, a dual personality, 40 per cent. of my time being available as Medical Officer of Health for the Borough, the remaining 60 per cent. as an Assistant County Medical Officer for personal health and school medical work. From 5th July, the administration of the maternity and child welfare services was taken over by the Surrey County Council, so that Barnes Borough Council was responsible only for these services until that date. Nevertheless, for comparative purposes, it seemed better to include annual figures where possible, and, with the permission of the County Council, I have been enabled to provide annual statistics in respect of most of the maternity and child welfare and allied services. The tables in which this has been done have been marked throughout the report with an asterisk (*). With the introduction of the National Health Service Act, the Barnes Infectious Diseases Hospital was taken over by the Regional Hospital Board, and the Ambulance Service by the Surrey County Council, so that information in connection with these services relates solely to the period 1st January until 4th July, 1948. May I take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to the Council for the confidence placed in me by appointing me their Medical Officer of Health, and my appreciation of their keen interest in all matters relating to public health. I should like to pay tribute to all the members of the staff of the Public Health Department, including those who have been 4 ferred to the Surrey County Council, and to the Matron and staff of the Infectious Diseases Hospital, for their good work and loyal co-operation. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ROSETTA HILL, July, 1949. Medical Officer of Health. 5 BOROUGH OF BARNES. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1948. PREFACE. In accordance with Ministry of Health Circular 3/1949, the Annual Report for 1948 has been prepared on the same lines as previous years, and consists of two parts—a preface in which reference is made to items of special interest, and an appendix in which is tabulated the statistics relating to the health of the district. STAFF. Mr. C. S. Perchard's period of office as Chief Sanitary Inspector and Housing Manager having been extended for a period of one year from the date of his retirement in 1947, he relinquished his appointment as Chief Sanitary Inspector on the 20th September, 1948, although, the Housing Section of the Department then having been made into a separate department, he continued in his capacity of Housing Manager until the 31st December, 1948. Mr. W. L. Leach, who had been Deputy Chief Sanitary Inspector, was appointed Chief Sanitary Inspector as from the 21st September, and in October Mr. P. J. Shannon was promoted to the vacancy of Deputy Chief Sanitary Inspector, which had resulted from Mr. Leach's appointment. The vacancy in the ranks of the District Sanitary Inspectors this caused has not been filled, and the question of whether or not to do so has been postponed sine die. As from the 5th July, 1948, the Matron of the Infectious Diseases Hospital and the staff of that Hospital were transferred to the Regional Hospital Board; the three Health Visitors, the Social Welfare Worker, the Matrons of the Day Nurseries and their staffs, the Ambulance Service staff, and the Home Helps were transferred to the County Council, together with the following members of the Administrative and Clerical section of the Health Department:- the Chief Clerk, Mr. Forrest, Miss Fairclough, Miss Morrell (who had been appointed in April for duties in connection with the School Medical Services), and Miss Campbell. Other alterations in the staff were as follows:—Mrs. S. O. Brown, Matron of the Sheen Day Nursery, resigned and left the 6 service on the 30th June; Miss J. Cleghorn was appointed Matron in her place and commenced duties on the 28th June. Miss D. L. Rhodes resigned her appointment as Matron of Castelnau Day Nursery, but did not actually cease duties until after the 4th July, and was still among the staff transferred to the County on that date. Miss J. Dupille, a temporary clerk, resigned and left on the 26th December. Mr. D. Rundle, a temporary clerk, did not elect to resume his employment in the Department after his period of National Service expired. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS DISEASES. The incidence of infectious disease in the Borough during 1948 was once again very low, and it is pleasing to be able to record that, with the exception of one from acute infectious encephalitis, no death occurred from any of the major notifiable infectious diseases. Poliomyelitis. In the autumn there were four cases of poliomyelitis in the Borough—two adults and two children. Two of the cases occurred, in one family—a child of six years developed the disease, and his mother later becoming infected. The two children affected both attended the same school. Three of the cases were severe, and one was slight; all the patients were treated in hospital, and all recovered with varying degrees of residual paralysis. This outbreak, in view of its apparently completely isolated nature from cases in any other area, was not only investigated by this Department, but also by special investigators of the Ministry of Health. Despite the most intensive inquiries, no source of infection could be ascertained. Tuberculosis. The number of new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis notified during 1948 was smaller by more than a third of the total of the previous year, which had been unusually high. At the end of the year, and continuing into 1949, the Barnes Borough Council arranged for the Mass Radiography Unit of the South-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board to visit the district to afford free facilities for x-ray to residents of the Borough and staffs of business houses and commercial undertakings. Besides sessions for the general public, special sessions were held for school children, for staffs of business houses and large finms. Publicity was given through the media of posters, 7 wide distribution of handbills, cinema slides, the local newspaper, and by personal visiting. The attendance was very satisfactory, and the following is a summary of the results :— Attendances Males. Females. Total. of general public 587 582 1,169 of staffs of business houses 360 125 485 of school children 319 162 481 Totals 1,266 869 2,135 Number recalled for large film X-ray 58 41 69 *Abnormalities discovered 97 67 164 (* Diagnosed from both miniature and large films.) Of the 164 persons showing abnormalities, five only (three men and two women) were discovered to be suffering from active pulmonary tuberculosis. The other conditions detected were mainly old cases of tuberculosis now recovered, some other less serious chronic chest conditions, and a few congenital abnormalities of the chest. DIPHTHERIA AND WHOOPING COUGH IMMUNISATION. These are services which have been transferred to the County Council. With the consent of the County Council, figures for the whole year have been included, and reference to Tables 11 and 12 shows that there was no diminution in the number of parents availing themselves of the facilities. During the year the use of a combined diphtheria-whooping cough prophylactic was introduced, thus enabling protection against both diseases to be given in one series of injections. Schick-testing three months after the initial series of injections as a check upon immunity, and at two-yearly intervals subsequently, was abandoned, and, instead, a scheme for giving a boosting dose just prior to admission to nursery or primary school, five years afterwards and at schoolleaving age, was introduced. In addition, arrangements are now in force for private doctors within the National Health Service to give the necessary injections wherever parents so prefer it, the material for the injections being obtained (hrough the local Health Department. In practice, it would appear that the great bulk of the children continue to receive the injections through the Health Centres. 8 INFANT MORTALITY RATE. The number of deaths of infants under one year during 1948 was 12, and the death rate per 1,000 live births 20.8—by far the lowest rate ever recorded in the area. The rate for England and Wales for 1948 was 34. The previous lowest rate for the Borough had been 32.9 in 1943. It is unwise to stress too much a very low rate for one year only, but as a matter of interest the average for Barnes for the six years prior to the war (1934-1939) was 53 per 1,000 live births; for the six war years (1940-1945), 45 ; and for the three post-war years (1946-1948), 31. There can be little doubt but that the increased supervision of the expectant mother, the greater use of ante-natal clinics, and the specialist obstetric services, the growth of consciousness of the importance of a wise and well-balanced diet for expectant mothers, have all contributed lo the general lowering of infantile mortality throughout the country-—a result in which the work of the Maternity and Child Welfare Service has played no little part. REMOVAL OF PERSONS IN NEED OF CARE AND ATTENTION. Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, makes special provision for securing the necessary care and attention for persons who are suffering from grave chronic disease, or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions, and are unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. Previously, only a few local authorities had powers under private Acts to require the removal of such persons to a place where they can receive proper attention. Under the powers conferred by this Section, application may be made, if necessary, to the Magistrates for the compulsory removal of these unfortunate people. Difficulty, however, in dealing with these cases is not the refusal of the person to be removed, but the problem of finding a suitable hospital or residential accommodation to which they can be transferred. Although no applications to the Magistrates were necessary, there have been several cases where action has been taken by the Department in cases where sick and elderly persons living alone needed care and attention. In these cases the closest liaison is maintained with the Social Welfare Officers of the County Council, and I am pleased to say that arrangements have been made for direct approach to the local hospital organisation. Unfortunately, the demand for accommodation for the elderly infirm is greatly in excess of the supply, and it is to be hoped that this position will be remedied at an early date. The conditions found on investigating these cases revealed an appalling state of affairs. Aged persons. 9 often without relatives and with very few friends, eke out a miserable existence, often in neglected and cramped accommodation. When sickness and infirmity overtake them, they become dependent on the charity of neighbours for such attention and sustenance as they require. Whilst medical and nursing care are available to them, and in certain cases domestic help also, facilities are lacking for the preparation of early and late meals and for someone to keep an eye on them at all times. SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE DISTRICT. Housing maintenance and the control of food preparation premises has taken up most of the time of the sanitary inspectors during the year. The enforced neglect of property repairs, together with the accumulated effects of war damage, results in a continuous flow of complaints by householders. Good progress has been made, however, and arrears of work are being steadily overcome. There is less difficulty in obtaining labour and materials for essential repairs, and it has not been found necessary to resort to formal proceedings in as many cases as in the last few years. The inspection of premises where food is prepared, handled and sold has received more attention, and it is gratifying to note that improved standards of hygiene in catering establishments are being maintained. It has been possible to pay more attention to conditions in the factories and workplaces in the Borough, and the miscellaneous types of premises which come under the control of this Department have received attention in proportion to their importance from the public health aspect. It has not been found possible to carry out much work in connection with the provisions of the Shops Acts, 1912-1936. The health and comfort provisions of these Acts, however, have usually been dealt with, when opportunity afforded, in conjunction with action taken with shops under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. FOOD HYGIENE CAMPAIGN. During May a modest attempt to excite public interest in food hygiene was undertaken. Through the kindness of a local firm of food distributors, suitable displays were arranged in shops' windows in Barnes and East Sheen respectively. Posters and exhibits were displayed, giving good and bad examples of food hygiene. By the co-operation of the firm mentioned, photographs relating to clean milk production were also exhibited. These displays attracted a good deal of attention from passers-by. Two public lectures were arranged and advertised, both in the local papers and by poster throughout the district. The public response 10 was very poor indeed, only a few people attending each lecture. Those who did attend heard a very interesting' discourse on food and drink infections, but it would appear that it was a case of preaching to the converted." As in many other trades, the personnel engaged in food distribution are insufficiently educated as to the consequences of lax standards. It would appear from our experience in this realm of publicity that the best results are to be obtained by individual approach to the workers at their places ol employment. WATER SUPPLY. The water supply of the area has been satisfactory, both in quality and quantity. The few complaints that were received were found to be due to conditions of storage and distribution on the occupiers' premises, and appropriate action was taken to have these conditions remedied. Water is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board ; a piped supply is provided to every house in the district, and control samples are taken regularly and frequently by the Board's officers. RODENT CONTROL. Apart from one major infestation at the Kew Meadows Path Piggeries and Refuse Destructor, no great difficulty was experienced in dealing with rat infestation during 1948. It is satisfactory to note that the degree of infestation in the sewers, although not serious to start with, is now very slight, and routine maintenance treatments at six-monthly intervals are all that is necessary. The majority of infestations on private property were small ones, involving chicken-houses, etc., and were usually disposed of in one treatment. The treatments on private property have been carried out free of charge, and a grant of 50 per cent. towards the cost of rodent control measures has been made by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. A few infestations involving business premises were satisfactorily dealt with and the costs recovered.

Milk is not produced in the area, and samples were not taken for phosphatase test or for bacteriological examination. In 1949 the sampling of milk supplies to schools will be carried out for bacteriological examination. This has previously been undertaken by the County Council. Several complaints about dirty milk bottles, and the souring of milk, were investigated, and representations made to the distributors concerned. A sequence of complaints relating to bottles delivered by a large firm of milk distributors resulted in a report being made to the Council. After careful consideration of the circumstances proceedings were commenced against the firm for depositing for sale milk which was unfit for human consumption. The milk in question was a bottle of Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised), and contained a quantity of dirt in suspension and as a deposit on the bottom. 28 The case was heard at the Mortlake Magistrates' Court and at the first hearing the summons was dismissed on a point of law, costs being awarded against the Council. An appeal was lodged, however, and heard in the Court of Appeal. This was successful and the case was sent back to the Magistrates, costs being awarded to the Council. At the continued hearing the Magistrates found the case proved. The defendant firm were fined five pounds, with forty guineas costs in respect of both hearings. Table 28.—Sampling of other Foods and Drugs. In addition to milk samples already mentioned, the following articles were purchased for the purpose of analysis by the Public Analyst. Foods. Coffee Essence Confectionery Flavourings Gelatine (powdered) Ground Ginger Gin (dry) Horseradish Honey Jam (red plum) Lemon Barley Crystals Milk (condensed) Olive Oil Picallili Pickalato Pastes, Fish and Meat Relish Rum Sausages Sausage Meat Soup Sauce, Worcester *Sauce, Tomato Soya Flour Semolina Vinegar Whisky Drugs. Lung Syrup *Peppermint Tablets Phospherine Vapour Rub Samples marked * were found to be below standard. Medicated Peppermint Tablets. The Public Analyst reported that these tablets were "of very poor quality, many being in a chipped, broken or crumbly condition. Moreover, all the tablets were contaminated throughout with numerous particles of dirt including particles of wood and other vegetable detritis." After due consideration by the Council a summons was issued against the manufacturers as being the actual offenders. The case was heard by the Mortlake Magistrates on the 1st June, 1948, and the summons was dismissed on the submission that the statement of evidence did not refer to Section 83 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. An application by the defendants for costs was not allowed on the grounds that the defence had not chosen to argue the case on its merits. Tomato Sauce. This product was found to contain an excess amount of preservative. On investigations being carried out by the Public Health Department of the Battersea Borough Council, in whose area the tomato sauce was produced, it was discovered that a quantity of "apple pulp," destined for use in jam making, had been utilised in the manufacture of the sauce instead. On representation being made to the manufacturers all stocks were withdrawn and measures taken to ensure that new consignments were in conformity with the regulations. Food Poisoning. No cases of food poisoning were reported during the year. A few cases of alleged food poisoning were investigated but were not substantiated. 29 Slaughterhouses. The only licensed slaughter house in the district was discontinued during the year, and has since been demolished. Thirteen pigs were slaughtered in the district. These belonged to pig clubs, and were slaughtered under hygienic conditions. All carcases were inspected. Table 29.—Unsound Food.
