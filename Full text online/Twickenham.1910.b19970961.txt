Assistant Inspector of Nuisances. ELIZABETH QUICK, Matron at Infectious Diseases Hospital. Twickenham Urban District Council. ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, 1 910. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you the Annual Report as to the Health and Sanitary condition of the Parish of Twickenham, the first ten months of which were under the superintendence of the late Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Marston Clark, whose lamented death occurred in November. Appendix " A " to the Report comprises the five tables required by the Local Government Board. Table I comprises the vital statistics of the whole District for 1910, and previous years extending from 1899. Table II consists of the Births and Deaths registered, and with a view to giving more concise information such table has been sub-divided corresponding with the four Wards of the District, viz.:—South, East, West, and Central. I still estimate the population at 27,000, comprising about 5200 in the South Ward, about 7500 in the East Ward, about 8800 in the West Ward, and about 5500 in the Central Ward. The Whitton Ward is still included in the West Ward, it being thought undesirable to make any alterafion before the figures of the forthcoming census are available. Table III shows the cases of Infectious Diseases notified during the past year. Of the total cases 29 were in the South Ward, 16 in the East Ward, 46 in the West Ward, and 16 in 3 the Central Ward. The removals to the Infectious Diseases Hospital, were 18 from the South Ward, 8 from the East Ward, 26 from the West Ward, and 7 from the Central Ward. These numbers represent roundly about one half of the cases notified. Table IV embraces the causes and ages at death for the same period. There were 299 deaths ; of these 57 occurred in the South Ward, 73 in the East Ward, 111 in the West Ward and 58 in the Central Ward. Table V gives the Infantile Mortality sub-divided into weekly periods up to one year of age. Appeudix."B " to the Report comprises the three tables required by the Middlesex County Council. Table (I) refers to Inspections of Dwelling Houses, Houses let in separate Dwellings or Lodgings, Common Lodging Houses, Canal Boats used as Dwellings, Movable Dwellings, Caravans, Tents, &c., Workshops and Workplaces, Inspections generally, and notices served. Table (II) contains the Inspection of Laundries, Bakehouses, Slaughter-houses, Cowsheds, Dairies and Milksliops, Unsound Food, Adulterated Food, Offensive Trades, Water Supply and Water Service. Table (III) relates to Water Closet accommodation, Drains, Cesspools, Disinfection, Dust Collecting, and sundry other Nuisances, such as overcrowding, smoke, &c., &c. Population. The Vital Statistics in this report are again calculated on an estimated population of 27,000, the near approach of the Census making it undesirable to effect any present alteration, and having regard to the large number of uninhabited houses, the parochial electors list not having materially increased, and the conclusions drawn from the number of births and deaths, I have not felt justified in basing my calculations on any other estimate. Further the new houses finally inspected prior to occupation during the year fell considerably below the average of preceding years, being 77 only as compared with 103 the previous year. The population at the time of the Census of 1891 was 16,026, and at the Census of 1901—20,991. 4 Births. The number of births registered in the district during the year was 696, a decrease of 7 in the number recorded in the preceding year. Of the total number of births registered 346 were males and 350 females. The total number of births for 1901 was 576 1902 „ 596 1903 „ 615 1904 „ 723 1905 „ 713 1906 811 1907 „ 774 1908 „ 751 1909 „ 703 1910 „ 696 The births were distributed as follows :— South Ward 138 Central „ 127 East ,, 159 West „ 272 The birth rate per 1,000 of population amounted to 25'7. It will be noticed that there has been a continued decline in the birth rate since 1906. This may be somewhat accounted for by an increase of the population of the district, which at this distance from the last census it is difficult accurately to estimate ; but after full allowance for this discrepancy the decline is marked and steadily increasing. Deaths. With an estimated population of 27,000, the number of deaths within the district was 251, a decrease of 60 as against last year. The death rate shewed an average of 9'2 per 1,000 as against 11'5 per 1,000 in the preceding year. I draw particular attention to these figures. It will be seen that the death rate is the lowest on record, the fall from year to year since 1901 being steady and almost continuous, which speaks very well for the health of the district, and has reached a rate it will be difficult to lower. I attribute this low record 5 largely to the continued rainfall of last summer and also the low summer temperature, the former cleansing the air and ground of microbic contamination and the latter being detrimental to their multiplication. The number of deaths registered during the last ten years were as follows :— 1901 was 254 equal to an average 12'9 1902 „ 264 „ „ 12.0 1903 „ 254 „ „ 10.5 1904 „ 319 „ „ 12.2 1905 „ 301 „ „ 11.5 1906 „ 334 „ „ 12.3 1907 „ 302 „ „ 11.2 1908 „ 289 „ „ 10.7 1909 „ 311 „ „ 11.5 1910 „ 251 „ „ 9.25 This list includes amongst the deaths from all causes 4 from Measles, 4 from Whooping Cough, 3 from Diphtheria, 5 from Enteritis, 1 from Puerperal Fever, 26 from Consumption, 12 from other Tuberculous diseases, 23 from Cancer, 29 from Bronchitis and Pneumonia, 8 from Alcoholism, 12 from Premature Birth, 36 from Heart Disease, 8 from Accidents, and 3 from Suicide. The deaths of residents registered in the district that took place at the two extremes of life, that is before they had reached the age of 12 months or after they had lived 65 or more years, proved to be 53'7 per cent, of the total of deaths at all ages. Of the deaths registered in the district and as taking place among the actual residents .in Twickenham, 73 exceeded 65 years of age. 16 were between the age of 65 and 70 years. 37 „ „ 70 „ 80 „ 17 „ „ 80 „ 90 „ Three died at the very advanced ages of 90, 91, and 93 respectively. In compiling the death returns of the district regard has to be had to those persons who are classed under the term " Resident," and also under the heading " Non.resident." 6 By the term " Non-resident" is meant persons brought into the district on account of sickness or infirmity, and dying in public institutions here, and the term " Resident" is meant persons who have been taken out of the district on account of sickness or infirmity, and have died in public institutions elsewhere. The "Public Institutions" to be taken into account for the purposes of Table IV are those into which persons are habitually received on account of sickness or infirmity, such as hospitals, workhouses and lunatic asylums. It follows therefore that the death of any person really belonging to an outside district must be classified as " Resident" unless such person dies in a local Public Institution, when he is deemed a "Non-resident." Fifty deaths of residents occurred outside the District in the undermentioned places :— Isleworth Infirmary 33 Hounslow Hospital 1 National Hospital for Paralysis, &c. 2 Wandsworth Asylum 3 Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street 1 Westminster Hospital 1 St. Bartholomew's Hospital 1 Peckham House Asylum 1 St. Luke's Hospital 1 King's College ,, 2 St. Thomas' ,, 1 Nursing Home, Putney 1 Found in River Thames 2 50 This number is a decrease on last year's number of six. The corrected " average" of death is ascertained by including deaths of residents (50) who have died outside the district and deducting those of non-residents (2) dying within the district. Therefore the corrected average is 299, which is represented by 11'07 per 1000, is a decrease of 2'33 per 1,000 upon the previous year, a very satisfactory figure. 7 Of the two deaths of non-residents which took place within the district, one occurred at St. John's Hospital, and one at the Nightingale Nursing Home. The epitome of ages at death including the foregoing is as follows :— Under 1 year 65 Over 1 year and under 5 years 23 Over 5 years and under 15 years 13 Over 15 years and under 25 years 13 Over 25 years and under 65 years 93 65 years and upwards 92 The deaths in tho various Wards were as follows :— South Ward 57 Central ,, 58 East ,, 73 West „ Ill Twelve deaths took place in St. John's Hospital, one in the Nightingale Nursing Home, and one at the Isolation Hosnital. The following Table summarises the mortality from the principal Zymotic diseases happening during the last 10 years 1901 1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 1907 1908 1909 1910 Small Pox 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Measles 2 8 1 2 0 13 4 3 2 4 Scarlet Fever 3 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 4 O Diphtheria 3 3 3 2 1 3 2 1 5 3 Whooping Cough 9 9 10 13 6 3 4 10 6 4 Enteric Fever 0 0 0 2 1 0 1 1 0 0 17 22 15 20 8 20 11 15 17 11 8 Infantile Mortality. As previously mentioned, the total number of deaths of children under one year of age was 65. Of these 20 occurred under the age of one week, 2 between one and two weeks, 2 between two and three weeks, and 4 between three and four weeks, a total under one month of 28. Six occurred between one and two months, 4 between two and three months, 5 between three and four months, 3 between four and five months, 3 between five and six months, 3 between six and seven months, 2 between seven and eight months, 2 between eight and nine months, 3 between nine and ten months, 2 between ten and eleven months, and 4 between eleven and twelve months. Included in the above figures are 12 premature births. The infantile mortality is equal to 21 per cent, of all deaths, and 8'9 per centage of births. This is an increase of 1 per cent, on the previous year. I am pleased to be able to state that the deaths which have taken place amongst infants under one year of age shewed improvement as compared with the number of births in all Wards. The returns proved that about one death occurred to every 10 births. The infant mortality rate in any district is far more accurate as a statement of fact than any other of the various rates included in vital statistics, as it is based on registered births and deaths, and is not in any way influenced by possible miscalculations in the estimate of the total population. It has already been explained that non-residents deaths are excluded in calculating a death rate. Non-resident births are included, because otherwise they would not be counted at all. A careful study of the chief causes of the infant deaths is necessary before any useful or practicable scheme for reducing infant mortality can be suggested. The 12 deaths attributed to Premature Birth is 1 more than the number registered from the same cause last year. Another important fact shewn in the table is that 12 infants died from such diseases as Atrophy, Debility or Marasmus, this generally speaking, means in simple language, Bad Feeding. Errors of diet are also the cause of most of the fatal cases (7) of Diarrhoea. 9 The deaths amongst infants under one year of age since 1901, are as follows, viz.:— South Ward. East Ward. Central Ward. West Ward. 1901 11 17 13 27 1902 10 19 20 36 1903 7 22 11 31 1904 13 14 23 59 1905 10 8 21 48 1906 13 16 26 67 1907 12 12 11 52 1908 12 14 15 33 1909 10 11 9 31 1910 10 14 9 32 From these figures it would appear that about 50 per cent, of the infantile mortality in the whole district arose in the West Ward, practically the same percentage as for last year. Notifiable Diseases. Subjoined is a table of the scheduled Notifiable Diseases with the number oik cases occurring in each year for the piast ten years. 1901 1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 1907 1908 1909 1910 Small Pox 0 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Scarlet Fever 105 57 23 101 41 82 64 72 102 65 Diphtheria and Membranous Croup 31 12 18 30 10 25 18 16 30 31 Typhus Pever 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Enteric or Typhoid Pever 9 9 3 7 2 6 5 1 1 0 Continued Pever 2 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 Relapsing Pever 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 o 0 Puerperal Fever 2 2 0 2 5 2 2 0 0 1 Cholera 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Erysipelas 10 4 4 8 11 17 8 11 3 12 159 94 48 148 70 132 98 100 136 109 10 This year's returns shews a decrease in comparison with the previous year of 27 cases. Measles. The number of deaths under this heading were four. Owing to its great infectivity at the earliest period, before any characteristic symptoms are present, isolation is impossible. It is one of the diseases from which practically everyone suffers, and the earlier it is contracted the milder its course, as a rule. Whooping Cough Whooping cough accounted for four deaths, all of which were under 5 years of age, three of which were attended by complications such as broncho-pneumonia or convulsions. Beyond excluding children from school when they are found to be suffering from this disease, practically nothing can be done to deal with it by sanitary administration. Scarlet Fever. . Sixty-five cases were recorded during the year, as compared with 102 for the preceding year; of these 29 took place in the South Ward, 16 in the East Ward, 46 in the West Ward, and 18 in the Central Ward. Out of 65 cases notified, 18 were removed from the South Ward to the Isolation Hospital, 8 from the East Ward, and 7 from the Central Ward, and 26 from the West Ward. The number of cases notified was 37 less than last year. Diphtheria. The number of cases notified amounted to 31 as compared with 30 in the preceding year. Three cases terminated fatally. Otherwise the method of dealing with the disease was exactly similar to previous years, viz., the examination gratis of swabs taken from the affected part and free distribution of AntiDiptheric Serum to persons considered unable to pay for it. The use thereof undoubtedly had the effect of deterring the spread of the disease and effecting cures. Arrangements are now being made for the reception of a limited number of diphtheria cases at the Isolation Hospital; this is referred to more fully under the section relating to the Isolation Hospital. Inquests. During the past year 22 inquests have been held. The findings of the juries were as follows :— 11 9 Heart disease. 1 Apoplexy. 1 Premature birth. 1 Asphyxia. 1 Want of proper attention at birth. 1 Tubercular Meningitis. 1 Pneumonia. 5 Accidental. 1 suffocated by food in trachea. 1 drowning. 1 fall. 2 knocked down by Motor Cars. 2 Suicides— 1 oxalic acid poisoning. 1 drowning. There were 22 post mortem examinations performed at the mortuary out of 23 bodies which were received therein. Water Supply and Analyses. Four samples of water drawn from wells were analysed and were found to be good, and fit for drinking and domestic purposes. There was the usual number of notifications received from the Metropolitan Water Board that certain dwellinghouses were without a sufficient water supply. In a great many instances it was found that the premises were empty, in other cases it was discovered that the water supply had been cut off by reason of the owner or occupier having failed to pay the water rate. The notifications occasioned many inspections to be made. Factory & Workshops Acts, 1901. During the year the factories, workshops and work places have been inspected as required by the Statute. It will be observed that the total number of trade premises under this heading are more than in previous years as also the number of employees, viz., 151 and 676 as compared with 139 and 648 last year. I am pleased to report that very few nuisances or sanitary defects were discovered in the course of this inspection, and it necessarily follows that the various proprietors and owners have paid due attention to the requirements of the Statute. 12 In only one case was there an infringement of the Act with respect to overcrowding, and this was remedied on the attention of the occupier being drawn to it without resource to the serving of a notice. The Home OiHce Inspector has notified a few minor defects which were discovered in the course of inspections, and which have been attended to. I venture to submit that the very few notices from the Government Inspector indicates a very satisfactory condition of the work places throughout the district. In every case were outworkers have been employed notices have been sent to the respective districts in which they reside, and in accordance with the statute other Local Authorities have notified to me in a similar manner. All outworkers are duly registered for reference in case of an outbreak of infectious disease. The following is a list of the factories, workshops and work places inspected during the year, number of employees therein, and particulars as to nuisances or sanitary defects discovered:— Trades represented.

There are at present 44 registered Dairies and Milkshops in the district, all of which are inspected at intervals during the year. On the question of milk s apply the opinion previously expressed, and which is generally endorsed by various authorities on the subject, that the supply of milk from shops other than proper dairies is not to be commended. The latter are, of necessity constructed specially for the storage and sale of milk, where the temperature can be regulated so as to retard the development of bacteria, and the milk is stored in such a manner as to ensure this important article of food being kept from contamination. There is only one argument in favour of the sale of milk from small shops, and that is the accommodation to certain customers, but it is obvious that this argument can have little weight, having regard to the fact that our local dairymen sufficiently cater for the sale of milk to meet the requirements of the district. The Veterinary burgeon reported tnat lie liad examined all the milch cows in the district in each quarter of the year. 1910. Number of cows examined. Found diseased.

Slaughter Houses and Meat Inspection. There are at present 10 private slaughterhouses in the district. These have been inspected regularly, and any works of whitewashing and cleansing have been carried out when required. The Local Government Board have recently issued a circular letter to Local Authorities, asking to be informed as to the exact method of meat inspection carried out in the District, and also enquiring whether there was an Inspector who held the necessary qualification in this respect. The Council were 111 the position to be able to reply that the Assistant Inspector of Nuisances held this and by working conjointly with the Senior Inspector the wishes of the Board might be carried into effect. Bakehouses. There are 19 bakehouses upon the register. All were under periodical inspections, and may be said to be in a satisfactory condition. Housing of the Working Classes Acts, 1890—1909. The Housing and Town Planning &c., Act, 1909, came into force in December 1909, its chief characteristic being the largely increased powers given to the Local Government Board and Local Authorities to administer its provisions, increased responsibilities are thrown upon the landlords of small properties, and there is simplification of the procedure as to the Closing and Demolition Orders in respect of property considered unfit for human habitation. During the year the Council acting upon the reports of their officials had occasion to make Closing Orders against 23 houses which were deemed unfit for human habitation, of these 10 were subsequently demolished, and the remainder are under repair in order to comply with the requirements of the act. No appeals were made with respect to the condemnation of the properties, and none of the orders have been determined. 17 A summary of the procedure adopted is set out in Appendix " C " of the report. Inspection of the Parish. Over 5,671 houses, premises, &e., have been inspected and re-inspected during the year, and 1488 sanitary notices for defects have been issued. The details of the work accomplished are set out in Appendix " B " of the report. Diseases of Animal Acts. I am pleased to state that no cases were reported under these Acts. The Customs and Inland Revenue Act. Under section 26 of 53 and 54, Vic. c. 8, exemption from the Inhabited Iiouse Duty is granted to houses divided into tenements of the annual value of less than £20, provided the Medical Officer of Health certifies that they afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons in respect of their sanitary arrangements. By section 11, 3 Ed. VII. this provision was extended to houses of the annual value of not more than £40. During the year applications were received in respect of the flats known as No. 1—8, Lebanon Park Parade, Richmond Road, and certificates were granted in all instances. Isolation Hospital. Fifty-nine cases of scarlet fever were admitted into the Hospital. There were 6 cases treated at the patients own homes. The work at the Isolation Hospital has proceeded satisfactorily during the year, only one fatal case having occurred. The paying ward has been occupied from time to time, and has doubtless proved a great convenience to the families of such patients. The boards of the playroom having shrunk since the building was erected, the floor has been " st ripped " and is now in a satisfactory condition, and is now much less calculated to store up infection. 18 The officers of the Institution have given every satisfaction in the discharge of their duties. One of the Probationers contracted Scarlet Fever during the year, but ultimately recovered after a severe illness.. When the Isolation Hospital was built at Whitton, a separate block was erected for the reception of Diphtheria cases. This had not been used up to the time that I commenced my duties, but acting upon my suggestion the Council decided at the end of the year to purchase the furniture required, and by re-arrangement of duties it will be possible to provide the necessary nurses without any increase in the permanent staff. The arrangements are now practically complete, and the Wards will be open to a limited number of cases chosen in preference for those houses where isolation is difficult or impossible. I am strongly in favour of a disinfecting oven being provided at the Hospital. At present there are no arrangements for disinfection of clothing or bedding, and the provision of such an apparatus would be of the greatest value not only in cases of Diphtheria or Scarlet Fever, but even more in cases of Tuberculosis. Enquiries are at present being made by your officers as to the probable cost, and the result will, I understand, be laid before you in due course. Tuberculosis. During the year there were 26 deaths registered in the district due to Phthisis, and 12 to other tubucular diseases, a total of 38 deaths due to tuberculosis. Under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations 1908, which are applicable only to protect those who came under the care of Poor Law Medical Officers, I received the following particulars:— During the year the number of notifications received under Form A (which gives the address of the patient prior to admission to a Poor Law Institution) were fifteen. Under Form B (which gives the name and address of the patient attended at their own address) eighteen. Under Form C (which gives intended address of the patient on leaving a Poor Law Institution) seven. Under Form D (which notifies the change of address of the patient) none. 19 Of the total cases notified under the Ord«r, three died ; one at their own homes and two in the Infirmary. When a case has been removed to the Infirmary or died at their own residence, the rooms have been disinfected and cleansed. In addition to the foregoing, I received one voluntary notification from Brompton Hospital. I am of opinion that Tuberculosis must claim greater and increasing attention from local authorities. The fact that one in eight of the entire population die from this disease, that its cause—a bacillus—is well known, and that it is in a measure preventable, to a far greater degree than is generally supposed. To be logical, all advanced cases should be isolated, as through their expectoration they disseminate the disease far and wide. I attach great importance to the notification of this disease, as by this means only can cases be traced and instructed as to the destruction of their affection. Disinfection of their rooms and clothing should be periodically carried out Light, especially sunlight, fresh air and ventilation, so important to health generally, are especially potent in the prevention and cure of this widespread and fatal disorder. With our full knowledge of the causes and with greater care and attention bestowed iipon this complaint by local authorities in the future, I look forward to a steady diminution of this insidious and widespread disorder. Buildings and Sewers. I am indebted to the courtesy of the Surveyor to the Council for the following particulars:— Plans of houses approved (excluding those known to be abandoned) 47 Plans for alterations and additions to existing buildings 26 Plans for relaying house drains 9 Houses connected to soil sewer 38 Houses connected to surface water sewer 35 Houses completed for occupation 77 Number of yards of surface water sewers constructed 554 New manholes constructed 4 20 New Streets. The following new streets have been made up under the provisions of the Private Street Works Act, 1892 :— Cambridge Road. Clevedon Road. Cassilis Road. Heath cote Road. House Refuse. The house refuse of the District is collected weekly by the Council's own staff, and the arrangements in connection therewith continue to give every satisfaction. Only 4 complaints were received with respect to non-removal, such complaints being chiefly due to the collectors not being able to obtain admission at the proper time. During the year 14,808 cubic yards of refuse, or an average quantity of 47 cubic yards per day, were collected, and disposed of in the Refuse Destructor. Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907. During the year the Council in pursuance of their powers under Sec. 112 of the Public Health Act, 1875, as amended by Section 51 Public Health Act Amendment Act, 1907, applied to the Local Government Board for confirmation of an Order declaring the trade of Fish Fryer to be an offensive trade within the district, (this does not apply to existing premises). The confirmation of the order has been granted by the Local Government Board, and it is hoped this may be the means of curtailing any nuisance that might arise under this head in the future. Glanders and Farcy Orders, 1907. Under this Order it is imperative for the Inspector under the Diseases (Animals) Act, 1894, to notify the Medical Officer of Health of Sanitary Authorities all outbreaks of anthrax and glanders. I have the pleasure of recording the fact that no notifications were received. 21 Sanitary Convenience. The Sanitary Convenience in King Street has worked well throughout the year, and has proved a convenience to the neighbourhood, and also to visitors. Bathing Place. This has continued to be highly appreciated and successful in every way, and is a great asset to the town. The attendant reported that 37 girls and 54 boys had been taught to swim during the season, and that the total attendance was 4,882 females, 39,280 males. For the first time ladies have been admitted a privilege they have greatly appreciated, and have frequently expressed their gratitude for this boon to the officers of the Council. Many have expressed the hope that in the coming summer the time assigned to their use may be extended. Costumes have been obtained by the Council and lent to the children attending the Public Elementary Schools in the district, thereby giving them equal facilities for bathing. It gives me pleasure to report the efficiency and courtesy of the Council's attendants to all using the place, a testimonial signed by a number of the regular bathers accompanied by a small monetary present was presented to them as a mark of appreciation of their good services.

In reviewing the details of this report, I cannot but hope the Council may be satisfied with the work that has been done in this important department. A steadily declining Death Rate during the last ten years, and which last year reached the very low figure of 9.25 per .1,000, may well be the envy and the pride of any district, and speaks volumes in praise of the healthiness of the locality. Still more can doubtless yet be done by continued watchfulness and increasing use of the many powers entrusted to your care for the benefit of the Public Health. I particularly hope we may in the future take our full share in the warfare now urged against Consumption in all its various forms, and which is still a dark page in the records of the national health. 23 The many recent Acts of Parliament and the increasing powers and instructions of the Local Government Board tend year by year to increase the work and importance of this department and claim more of the time and attention of the Council. During the comparatively short time the work has been entrusted to my care it gives me pleasure to express my appreciation of the zeal and efficiency with which the various officers of the department have performed their duties, which has been to my entire satisfaction. It is always a somewhat difficult task to take up duties such as these at short notice and without the aid of introduction or assistance from one's predecessor. The difficulties, however, have been much diminished by the help and information given me by the Council's officials, and especially have I to express my appreciation of the kindness and courteous consideration extended to me during my term of office by the Health Committee and members of the Council. I have the honour to be, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, G. H. DUP0NT, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. London Road, Twickenham. February, 1911. Appendix " A." TABLE I.
