ORANIE arrived at Mark Brown's Wharf from Malta with a cargo of 13,886 bags of onions (approx. 350 tons). The ship was discharged immediately and the onions were then in good condition. No deliveries, however, were made at that time and, during August, the weather was very hot. The onions began to deteriorate rapidly and letters to the effect that the onions were becoming unsound were sent to the shipping agents and the importers. The only delivery from this consignment was on the 30th August when the importers removed 415 bags. The remainder of the cargo was not taken up. By the 6th September the onions had become an offensive accumulation and nuisance notices under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, were served on the Wharf Proprietors, the shipping agents and the importers. The remainder of the cargo (said to be 13,471 bags) was destroyed under the supervision of this Department on 12th to 16th September, 1955.

CHINESE EGG ALBUMEN During 1955 a number of samples of Chinese Egg Albumen were found to be bacteriologically unsatisfactory. As a result Medical Officers of Health at ports of entry were asked by the Ministry of Health to increase their sampling of this commodity. Sampling in Bermondsey commenced in July and, during the latter half of the year, tests were made on all Chinese Albumen entering the borough. Bacteriological examination at the Central Public Health Laboratory showed evidence of contamination by salmonella organisms in a number of the samples, and the batches from which these samples were taken were immediately placed under detention. The contaminated albumen was subsequently released either for re-export or for use in high temperature baking. In November, 1955, the bakery trade, realising that even a negative bacteriological test might not prove conclusive issued the following statement in the trade journals as a further safeguard to the public:— CHINESE ALBUMEN Investigations into samples of recent importations of Chinese Albumen for use in food have made it evident that, by reason of the nature of the product, a negative bacteriological test on limited samples is not conclusive evidence that the bulk is fit for use in food unless this use is restricted to certain processes ensuring sterilisation. After discussion with the trade certain Medical Officers of Health have been releasing albumen which on sampling shows negative results to Salmonellae, and stipulating that it is only to be used in such goods, or products, which during the course of manufacture will be subjected to a temperature of over 212° for upwards of 10 minutes. Hence it can be used for the making of Marshmallow, Macaroon Paste, and similar products where the final article is either baked before consumption or the manufacturing process of the product ensures that the albumen after reconstitution will be subjected to a temperature of 212° for 10 minutes. It must NOT be used for Cream Fillings, Soft Icings, or incorporation into Fondant. Albumen Preparations: —It must NOT be used for Meringue Powders, Marshmallow Powders, etc., unless the container carries a label to the effect that goods made therefrom must be subjected to the sterilising temperature explained above. Ground Albumen Preparations: —If made from Chinese Albumen should carry a label stating that the product is NOT to be used for Royal Icing or any cold process purpose. Conversely, any Albumen product sold for use in the making of Royal Icing should only be made from European Albumen, or Chinese Albumen which has been subjected to an approved heat treatment. HYGIENE:— As a further safeguard the following points should be noted: (1) All utensils used must be thoroughly cleansed by washing in boiling water, and the washing must be so arranged that the washingup water does not infect other utensils. (2) Operatives must thoroughly wash their hands and arms before handling other foodstuffs.

CLUBS: The activities of the eight clubs have continued throughout the year and classes have been arranged for handicraft and singing. Where conditions were suitable, film shows were provided by the Borough Council. Each club has held a Christmas Party and Club Leaders have arranged outings to the seaside and to pantomimes, ice shows and circuses. The work undertaken by the Club Leaders and their helpers is of great importance and plays a large part in the relief of loneliness in the aged. OUTINGS TO WOMEN'S INSTITUTES: During the summer of 1955 twenty-one visits were paid to various Women's Institutes in and around the Home Counties and once again it is necessary to thank these Institutes for their hospitality and generosity. Some invitations were received from Institutes which had not been visited before and it is a pleasure to extend the activities in this field. Some of the clubs have in turn entertained parties from Women's Institutes. HOLIDAYS: Arrangements were made for 150 people to spend holidays by the sea, the majority going to Ramsgate. MEALS SERVICE: This service is operated by the Department under the existing arrangements with the Council for the Welfare of Old People who meet all the operating costs. The meals are delivered each day from Monday to Friday and the daily average has increased to 74. The total number of meals delivered during the year was 16,130. As in previous years a special Christmas Dinner was provided for each person on the meals list. This dinner, consisting of traditional Christmas fare, is specially pre-cooked and packed so that it is simple to prepare for consumption. Each person was also given six new laid eggs by a donor who wished to remain anonymous. OUTINGS: As in 1954, the afternoon coach outings for the homebound old folk were arranged. Four coach parties were taken for a ride around the countryside and tea was provided en route. Members of the Council for the Welfare of Old People were in charge of the parties and the District Nursing Association arranged for a nurse to accompany each party. WORKROOMS FOR THE ELDERLY: The Council have had under consideration the provision of workrooms for the elderly. The object is to provide the elderly with employment within the limits of their capacity, to help them preserve health of body and mind, to find comfort in the company of their fellow workers and the relief of loneliness and, at the same time, receive some remuneration. It is envisaged that the Department will operate the scheme on behalf of the Council for the Welfare of Old People and that a start will be made early in 1956. INVESTIGATION OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, through the Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee, requested the Council to set up stations for the measurement of smoke and sulphur dioxide by the volumetric method and to provide deposit gauges for the measurement of deposited matter. Local Authorities, Government Departments, Industrial Organisations and others have agreed to co-operate in studying the polution of the atmosphere and its prevention, and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research have undertaken the work of co-ordinating the observations, the object of the investigation being to obtain exact information about the nature and extent of atmospheric pollution. The success of the investigation depends on the proper use of standard methods and instruments which have been developed for the purpose of making observations of atmospheric pollution and only under these conditions, when the results obtained are strictly comparable, can sound conclusions be drawn. Ash and grit can be measured by collecting samples of deposited matter. Smoke and sulphur dioxide can be measured by pumping air through apparatus designed to withdraw and measure specific kinds of suspended impurity. Two deposit gauges, one on the roof of the Clinic, Grange Road, and one on the roof of Brunei Road flats, were set up on Ist April, 1955, to measure deposited matter. The gauge is exposed for periods of one month and all solid and liquid material, including rain, which falls within the 12 in. diameter circle of the glass collecting bowl passes down the connecting pipe of rubber and stainless steel into a glass bottle. On the first day of the following calendar month the bowl is cleaned with the collected rainwater which is allowed to run into the bottle. The bottle is replaced by a clean bottle and the deposit gauge is ready for another month's exposure. Both deposit gauge bottles are handed to the Public Analyst who carries out an analysis of the deposited matter. Since October, 1955, regular observations of the daily average concentration of smoke and sulphur dioxide have been made by means of apparatus installed in the Municipal Offices. The smoke is measured by drawing a measured volume of air through a white filter paper in such a way that the entire solid impurity from the air remains in the filter paper as a grey stain. The weight of material caught is estimated by matching the stain with a scale of shades, which has been previously calibrated by matching with weighed stains. The sulphur dioxide is measured by drawing air from outside the building at a steady rate of about 50 cu. ft. per day through a hydrogen-peroxide bubbler, the volume of air being measured with a gas meter. The bubbler contains 25 ml. of dilute hydrogen peroxide, and sulphur dioxide is removed from the air to form sulphuric acid. At the end of a day's run the volume of standard alkali needed to neutralize the sulphuric acid is measured. The average concentration of sulphur dioxide during the period of the test can then be calculated by formula. The amount of deposited matter recorded by the deposit gauges at Brunei Road and the Public Health Centre, Grange Road, is shown hereunder. Grange Road Brunel Road Rainfall ins.

During the year under review the number of persons availing themselves of this service has considerably increased: — 1954 1955 Males 12,976 25,840 Females 3,244 4,855 STREET AND OPEN MARKETS Bermondsey Square ('New Caledonian'). Number of available pitches 197 Number of licences in operation during 1955 218 Income for 1955 £3,668 17 6 The New Caledonian Market in Bermondsey Square continued to be well attended during 1955. The demand for pitches was still well in excess of the number available and, in an attempt to alleviate this problem, it was decided, as an experimental measure, to create an additional 18 pitches by 'closing the ranks' of the existing stalls. The experiment proved successful and a further 18 licences were granted. At the end of the year there were 197 traders licensed, of whom 164 were dealers in antiques and similar commodities. THE USE OF W.C.s AND-WASHING FACILITIES IN THE COUNCIL'S PUBLIC CONVENIENCES ARE FREE. STREET MARKETS Total Income for 1955 £2,805 5 9. Albion Street. The Street Market in Albion Street was originally designated in 1947 to extend from Lower Road to Swan Road. During the ensuing years, however, the number of applications for licences seemed insufficient to justify such a large portion of the street being so designated. The matter was reviewed in January, 1955, when it was decided to de-designate that portion stretching from Renforth Street to Swan Road, thus reducing the number of available pitches from 60 to 25. The total number of licences in operation during 1955 was 7. Trident Street. This market, like that in Albion Street, appears to be unpopular among street traders, probably because of its position. Out of the seven pitches available, only three were used during 1955. Railway Approach. Number of available pitches 15 Number of licences in operation during 1955 ...... 15 The small market in Railway Approach, which was designated in 1952 for the sale of fruit and flowers, has continued to be successful and trouble-free throughout 1955.

Tower Bridge Road. Number of available pitches 30 Number of licences in operation during 1955 33 There were no untoward incidents during 1955 and the Council's decision, in 1954, to increase the number of pitches from 17 to 30 seems to have been fully justified. Various. There are a number of isolated pitches in various streets which have not been designated for the purpose of street trading. The total number of licences in operation in 1955 was 19. One application received was for a pitch outside the 'Globe' Cinema in Aberdour Street but, as there was one trader licensed in that area already, it was felt that, from a traffic point of view, an additional stall might constitute a danger to people leaving the cinema. The licence was granted for a trial period of six months in the first instance but, there being no incidents during that time, was later extended unreservedly. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (Amendment) ACT, 1951. SECTION 50. Under Section 50 of this Act, it is the duty of the Borough Council to cause to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died or has been found dead in the Borough where there are no relatives or friends to make the necessary arrangements. With the aid of the Coroner and the Police it is also incumbent upon the Council to ascertain whether or not the cost incurred can be reimbursed from the deceased's estate. The Borough is bounded on its north side by the River Thames and, during 1955, the bodies of 2 stillborn children and 5 adults were recovered on the foreshore. The cost of interment of the children and 2 of the adults was borne by the Council. Of the remaining adult bodies, 2 were identified by relatives who made arrangements for burial, and 1 proved to be an employee of a shipping company which agreed to meet the funeral expenses in view of the fact that there were no known relatives. In all cases the cost of removal of the bodies to the mortuary was written off as irrecoverable. The cases reported hereunder were also dealt with under the provisions of Section 50. 1. Information was received at 3 p.m. on 3rd January, 1955, that Mr. W. D. had died the previous morning and that his wife had made no arrangements for the interment. On investigation it was found that the couple occupied two rooms and that Mrs. D. had no financial means to pay for the cost of a funeral as she and her husband had been solely dependent on their retirement pensions. The undertaker was instructed to arrange for the immediate removal of the body as it was lying on the only bed in the couple's possession. Funeral expenses were met by the Council. 2. At the request of the Coroner's Officer, arrangements were made for the interment of Mr. C. H. B. who died in a common lodging house in the Borough on 5th February, 1955. Following extensive enquiries it was found that the deceased had been living for a considerable time in various lodging houses in London; no relatives or friends could be traced and, apart from his clothing which consisted mainly of rags, his only possessions were a pipe, knife, purse, and a tin box containing the sum of 19s.ld. The balance of the funeral expenses was met by the Council. 3. Following the death of Miss A. M. B., a Coroner's Inquest recorded an open verdict, and the only relative who could be traced was a cousin who requested the Council to make the funeral arrangements. In view of the amount of money in the estate it was decided, with the approval of the deceased's cousin, to arrange for the interment in a private grave. Pending ing the winding up of the estate, the deceased's effects were taken into store. 4. Following a post mortem on Mr. F. L., who died from coronary thrombosis in a common lodging house in the Borough, arrangements were made for his burial as no relatives could be traced. Funeral expenses, less the sum of £1 17s. 4d. found in the deceased's possession, were borne by the Council. 5. As no relatives could be traced, funeral arrangements were made for Miss A. O. who died on 6th December, 1955. Costs incurred by the Council were met from the estate. SECTION 47. Under this Section of the Act the Council may apply to a Court for an Order for the removal to hospital, or other institution, of a person who is aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, who is living in insanitary conditions and who is "unable to devote to himself, and is not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention." In addition, the National Assistance (Amendment) Act 1951 empowers a magistrate to order the emergency removal of such people to an institution for periods not exceeding three weeks on certification by the Medical Officer of Health and a general practitioner. Fifteen persons were regularly visited during the period but in none of these cases was it considered that the use of powers under the Act was advisable ; three cases in need of mental treatment, however, were referred to the duly authorised officer appointed by the London County Council and nine persons were persuaded, in their own interests, to enter institutions voluntarily. PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1936, SECTION 122 On a report by the Medical Officer of Health that the dirty condition of personal effects is likely to spread infectious disease the Council are authorised to remove and cleanse such articles. During 1955 I visited the homes of 18 old persons who were seriously ill, senile or incontinent and, in all these cases, I found there was a considerable quantity of soiled bedding and personal clothing which it was essential to have cleansed in the Disinfecting Station. Where necessary, these articles have been collected at regular intervals, cleansed and returned to the owners.
