Applications have also been received by the Vestry for permission to lay down Sewers Works on the following Estates and Roads, viz.:— British Empire Land Company—Lordship lane British Land Company—Peckham rye Rye Hill park, Peckham rye Colby road, Norwood Roycroft's Estate, rear of Crown street, Wyndham road Wood's road and Athearn road, Peckham Fenwick road and Gledhill road, East Dulwich Ulverscroft road, near Goose green 11 Seldon road, Clapton road and Westbury road, near Cemetery road Belham street and Mosedale street near, Kimpcon road Gloucester road (partof), Peckham grove, Rawlins' Estate These several properties have been permanently sewered at the cost of the owners, the Works having been superintended by the Officers of the Vestry. It is now my pleasing duty to report that the whole of the Local Sewers Works contemplated in the scheme which I prepared for your consideration (as per Block Plan and Report presented to the Vestry, on the 9th November, 1864) are complete. And I have further to report that these Works are in a satisfactory condition, and performing the drainage of the Parish efficiently. No floodings have occurred in any of the localities so sewered, where formerly, from the imperfection of the drainage of this depressed area, both the House and Surface Drainages were in times of heavy rains most seriously impeded. 12 The Metropolitan Board of Works is at this time lowering and improving several of the secondary Main Lines of Sewers within this Parish, which are under their jurisdiction, on the completion of which, with the sufficient outlets of the High and Low Level Sewers of the Main Drainage Works now nearly completed, I am justified in saying that the future of this Parish, in respect to its sewerage and drainage, will be second to none in the Metropolis. I may further remark that these Local Works, to which I have referred, comprising a total length of about thirty-two miles of permanent Sewers,have been executed within the space of about three years. The entire Parish (at least as far as the inhabited part is concerned) is now thoroughly Sewered, affording means for the Drainage of all House property, which latter work is being carried on with all possible despatch through your Sanitary Officers; and, as regards the uncovered portions 13 of the Parish, the Main and Local Sewers already executed provide outlets, ready for use when required for these districts. In most instances, on the lines of the new Local Sewers, the old (and frequently defective) High Level Sewers have been broken up, filled in, and abolished; but where practicable they have been connected with the new lines, with improved fall, and thus made to act as permanent auxiliaries to the general system. The Main Sewerage of the Parish having been so amply provided, now enables the Officers of the Yestry to press on the equally necessary work of House Drainage, which work is engaging their constant attention, as the returns of Houses drained into these new Sewers will show. 14 HOUSE DRAINAGE.

BRISTOWE, M.D., Lond., Fellow 0f the Royal College 0f Physicians, Physician to St. Thomas's Hospital. Gentlemen, During the fifty-two weeks ending December 28th, 1867, 3417 births and 2056 deaths were registered in the Parish of Camberwell. The number of births was greater by 96, and the number of deaths greater by only 6, than the respective numbers of births and deaths registered in fifty-two weeks of the year 1866. I have shown on former occasions that, in the Parish of Camberwell, both births and deaths have invariably increased year by year for several years past, and that this 18 constant double increase is manifestly the result of increasing population. It is satisfactory to observe that the births have, on the present occasion, increased in a much larger proportion than the deaths, a circumstance which indicates that Camberwell has shared in the general healthiness which the Registrar-General's report shows to have prevailed throughout London during the year 1867. According to the Registrar-General's " Summary of Weekly Returns of 1867," it appears that, judging from the mortuary rate, "that year was the healthiest that London had enjoyed since 1860." The death rate per cent. was—for 1861, 2.318; for 1862, 2.356; for 1863, 2.447; for 1864, 2.653; for 1865, 2.456; for 1866, 2.648; while for 1867, it was 2.298 only. Further, according to the same authority, and by the same test, of all the five groups of districts into which London is, for registration purposes, divided, the southern group (which includes Camberwell) was the healthiest part of London. The deathrate in the central districts was 2.433 per cent., in the eastern districts 2.423, in the northern districts 2.319, in the western districts 2.202, and in the southern districts 2 198. That the year has been unusually healthy for us in Camberwell is further shown by certain facts which our own mortuary tables disclose. Thus, though the total mortality was larger in 1867 than in 1866, the deaths of young children diminished; 550 children under one year of age died in 1866, 511 only died in 1867 ; 335 children between one and four died in the former 19 year, 320 only in the latter year. There was also a very general diminution in the mortality from the so-called "zymotic" class of diseases; Diphtheria caused 11 deaths in 1866, 8 in 1867 ; Small-pox—35 in 1866, 9 in 1867 ; Measles—38 in 1866, 20 in 1867 ; Fever—53 in 1866, 41 in 1867; Hooping cough—72 in 1866, 64 in 1867 ; and Diarrhoea and Cholera—120 in 1866, 73 in 1867. Scarlet fever alone showed an increase of from 59 to 75. In respect of the general state of the health of the Parish, there is nothing further calling for special remark, beyond the fact that, judging from the mortality, it improved remarkably as the year advanced. It should be observed, however, that as an invariable rule (owing to the influence of cold and inclement weather) the first and fourth quarters of the year show a higher mortality, and generally a considerably higher mortality, than the two intermediate quarters. In the first quarter of 1867, 624 deaths were registered; in the second quarter, 504; in the third quarter, 419; and in the fourth quarter 509. The following are the most important points which the statistical tables reveal in regard to the sub-districts of Camberwell :—The births in Dulwich were 60, or less by 6 than the number registered the year immediately preceding; but in all the other sub-districts there was an increase in the births. In Camberwell the increase was from 852 to 869, in Peckham from 1318 to 1324, and in St, George's from 1085 to 1164. As regards deaths, these 20 diminished in Camberwell from 673 to 669, but they increased in Dulwich from 32 to 33, in Peckham from 740 to 745, and in St. George's from 605 to 609. Of the 669 deaths returned from the Camberwell sub-district, 108 took place in twolunatic asylums, and 138 in the workhouse. The distribution of deaths from zymotic diseases was as follows:—Hooping cough, 2 in Dulwich, 14 in Camberwell, 18 in Peckham, and 30 in St. George's; measles, 5 in Camberwell, 10 in Peckham, and 5 in St. George's; diphtheria, 2 in Camberwell, 4 in Peckham, and 2 in St. George's ; scarlet fever, 24 in Camberwell, 17 in Peckham, and 34 in St. George's; fever, 1 in Dulwich, 7 in Camberwell, 13 in Peckham, and 20 in St George's; small-pox, 1 in Dulwich, 4 in Camberwell, 1 in Peckham, and 3 in St. George's; diarrhoea and cholera, I in Dulwich, 16 in Camberwell, 29 in Peckham, and 27 in St. George's. In most former reports I have endeavoured to give an estimate of the population of the parish and of its registration districts, and an estimate of their death-rates; but have generally had to explain how uncertain for a parish like Camberwell all such estimates are. And although such estimates are increasingly fallacious as we recede year by year from the time at which the census was taken, and although consequently such calculations for the present year are doubtless little trustworthy, I venture to give them. If Camberwell and its four sub-districts have all increased year by year since 1861, according to their 21 tive rates of increase during the previous ten years, the population of Camberwell in the middle of 1867, was 84543, that of Dulwich was 1782, that of the Camberwell subdistrict 23958, that of Peckham 35437, and that of St. George's 23756. But, as I have shown in my last annual report, there are many grave reasons for believing that the rate of increase, especially the rate of increase in some of the sub-districts, has been very much greater than that which previous experience would have led us to believe. Throughout England, the birth-rate, according to the Registrar General, is 3.314 per cent. of the population; and assuming that this has been the birth-rate in Camberwell, the population of the parish must have been in the middle of last year 102983, instead of 84543 ; that of Dulwich 1808, instead of 1782; that of the Camberwell sub-district 26190, instead of 23958; that of Peckham 39904, instead of 35437 ; and that of St. George's 35081, instead of 23756. The death-rates calculated on the first estimate of population are—for Camberwell 2432 per cent., for Dulwich 2.076, for Camberwell sub-district 2.007, for Peckham 2.087, and for St. George's 2.913. The death-rates, calculated on the second estimate, are—for Camberwell 1.996, for Dulwich 2.046, for Camberwell sub-district 1.83, for Peckham 2.12, and for St. George's 1.95. Of the two series of estimates of population and of death-rates, I have no doubt that the latter of both are the most nearly correct. I have no doubt, especially, that the 22 estimated death-rate lor St. George's of 2.913 per cent. is preposterously beyond the truth. For a full explanation of the reasons which have led me to arrive at the above conclusions I must refer to my last report. Table III. furnishes a summary of the sanitary work done between the 25 th March, 1867, and the 25 th March, 1868. It will be seen from the table that during that time 5730 houses have been systematically inspected; that 2436 complaints as to non-removal of dust have been attended to; that 767 miscellaneous complaints (including complaints as to pigs, accumulation of manure, &c.), have also been dealt with, and that 115 bakehouses, 56 cow-houses, and 49 slaughter-houses have been inspected ; that 1465 Vestry notices have been served (including 125 second notices), and that 54 summonses have been taken out. It will be seen also that 1044 drains have been cleansed and amended, and 1363 trapped; that 957 cesspools have been emptied, and 1196 filled up and abolished, and 756 closets provided; that 86 new butts or cisterns have been supplied, and 275 covered, and that water has been laid on in 92 cases; that 248 houses have been whitewashed and cleansed, and 145 repaired; that 75 yards have been paved, and 1083 dust-bins provided. It will be seen also that at the end of the year 76 notices were still uncomplied with. I may add that I have periodically laid before the Vestry the results of my examination of the gas of the South Metropolitan Gas Company; and that with the 23 assistance of Dr. Bernays, of St. Thomas's Hospital, I have regularly tested the water supplied by the several Water Companies whose pipes are distributed through the parish, and also from time to time tested the water of private wells, — the results of all which examinations have been brought under your notice.
