To the Chairman and Members of the Council, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present to you the Forty-Sixth Annual Report on the health of your Urban District. The death-rate this year has fallen to 6.77 per 1,000 of the population. The infantile death-rate, that is the number of deaths in infants under one year per 1,000 live births, is the lowest ever recorded, the figure being 18.39. Poliomyelitis was responsible for four deaths, which occurred in the late summer and autumn. There was no death from diphtheria. During the year the Food Hygiene Guild has been active in its attempts to instruct the public and food-shopkeepers in the importance of cleanliness in the handling of food. The Chairman of the Public Health Committee has taken a leading part in this campaign, being assisted therein by the Chief Sanitary Inspector. This will, doubtless, have a progressive effect, with consequent diminution in the incidence of "dirt " diseases. Housing continues to be a problem. One hundred and eightythree permanent houses were built during the year and five houses re-built after destruction toy bombs, but this has resulted in no great reduction in the waiting-list for houses. It will be seen that, on the whole, the health of the Urban District is very good. The figures in this Report have been prepared by the Chief Sanitary Inspector. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, J. STANLEY LLOYD, Medical Officer of Health. 2 SECTION A STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (acres) 5,171 Population (Census 1931) 22,969 Population (mid-year 1950): Registrar General's Estimate 65,720 Civilian Population Figure Number of Inhabited Houses as at 31st December, 1950 17,197 Rateable Value (estimated) as at 31st December, 1950 £420,159 Product of a Penny Rate £1,697 EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS OF THE YEAR Live Births:— M.
