The Vestry of the Parish of St. Mary, Lambeth. SECOND ANNUAL REPORT. In the Report of the present year it is necessary to advert to that already presented to the Vestry. During the first parochial year the operations of the Vestry were, to a certain extent, of a theoretical character, considerable time having been spent in constituting Committees, framing Bye Laws, and defining the duties of the Officers, in order that the Act might be put into efficient operation. The Vestry were also engaged in determining the expediency of negociating Loans, for the purpose of effecting Improvements of an important and permanent nature, in respect of New Sewerage Works, Repair of Highways, &c. It is conceived the paramount object of the Legislature, in extending, or calling into fuller exercise, the representative principles evolved by the Act, was, that the great benefits arising from improved Sewerage Works, better Roads and Footpaths, and Watering of Roads, and more efficient Lighting thereof, should be extended over the entire Parish, and not confined to sections or favored portions. In the operations of the Vestry, this has been adhered to as far as practicable, so that general taxation might be followed by general improvement. A 2 4 The works in contemplation, at the date of the last Report, (the 27th day of June, 1857,) were the construction of a Sewer in the Clapham Road, and the repairing and kerbing the Footpaths of Turnpike Roads within the Parish, the onus of repairing which was cast upon the Vestry by the 244th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act. These important Local Improvements are nearly completed, the extent and nature thereof being hereinafter commented upon. In effecting the same, a large outlay has necessarily been made, but care has been taken by the Vestry to render the present addition to local taxes as light as possible, by spreading the re-payment of the Loans for such purposes over periods of ten and twenty years. The following are the various improvements effected in the parochial year, described under the respective heads of Sewerage, and Street and House Drainage Works, &c., at page 4; Sanitary Matters, at page 9; Highways, New Works, and Improvements, at page 15; and Lighting Matters, at page 21. SEWERAGE, HOUSE DRAINAGE WORKS, ETC. Amongst the New Works executed, the largest is the construction of a Sewer along the Clapham Road, for the accomplishment of which, fruitless efforts had been made from time to to time by the occupiers and owners of property. The importance of this Sewer is considerable, if regarded as affording means for I )rainage to the houses in front of which it is carried; but upon its construction depended the drainage of all the district between the Brixton and the Clapham Roads, from Kennington Church to Stockwell, an area of 300 acres, containing upwards of four miles of roads and 1250 houses, the lower part being subject to frequent floodings, and the upper notorious tor its total want of drainage. The character of this District is now entirely changed; the depth of the Sewers, 5 with sufficient inclinations and free outlets, render it better provided with the means for good drainage than any other part of the Parish. The contract sum for constructing this Sewer is £4,877, the extras being only £48 10s. 7d.; additional works were authorized by the Vestry, amounting to £69 13s.; and connexions for Private Drainage, which were paid for by the applicants, amounted to £371 2s. 2d. A new Sewer has been constructed in Chester Street, whereby the drainage of a large area into Kennington Lane by a direct line has been diverted, instead of its former tor???ous route by Kennington Cross; this has not only lessened the distance to be travelled by the Sewage, but has relieved the Junction at Kennington Cross from an accumulation of ???leposit. In laying out the plans and sections of New Works, he sizes have been arranged in proportion to the area to be ???rained; and while cost has not been spared to provide Sewers of ???ufficient capacity, economy has been studied, and care taken to ???avoid unnecessary outlay. During the year, public advertisements have been issued ????or the construction of works, and the following contracts have been entered into; viz:— 1st. With Mr. Thomas Ennor, for the General Works. 2nd. With Mr. William Dethick, for Sewer in Clapham Road. 3rd. With Mr. William Dethick, for Sewer in Chester Street and other places. 4th. With Mr. Thomas Ennor, for Sewer in Stockwell Road and other places. NEW WORKS. Clapham Road 3870-ft. Brick Sewer, 4-ft. 6-in. by 3-ft. 1940-ft. Brick Sewer, 3-ft. 9-in. by 2-ft. 6-in. This Sewer commences near Kennington Church, the larger ???e from the Church to the "Swan" at Stockwell, and thence ???e smaller size to within a few feet of the Parish boundary. 6 South Island Place 380-ft. Brick Sewer, 3-ft. by 2-ft. 480-ft., 12-in. Pipe. This Sewer discharges into the Clapham Road, the larger size is carried up to the branch from Saint Ann's Road, and 12-in. pipes to the Brixton Road beyond. Holland Street 770-ft. Brick Sewer, 3-ft. by 2-ft. 430-ft. 12-in. Pipe. This Sewer discharges into the Clapham Road, the large size being carried to the junction with Saint Ann's Road, and 12-inch pipes beyond. Saint Ann's Road 220-ft. Brick Sewer, 3-ft. by 2-ft. 1690-ft. 12-in. Pipe. This Sewer discharges partly into South Island Place, and partly into Holland Street; the Brick Sewer is carried up to a Branch Street leading to the Brixton Road. Chapel Street, Brixton Road 400-ft. 12-in. pipe, This Sewer discharges into Saint Ann's Road. Chester Street, kennington 820-ft. 3-ft. 9-in. by 2-ft. 6-in. Brick Sewer, This Sewer is laid to connect the existing Sewers in Kennington Road and Kennington Lane, and affords a more direct course for the sewage from Lambeth Walk, East Street, &c. This work was in progress on the 25th March. Stockwell Road 2770-ft. Brick Sewer, 3-ft. by 2-ft. This Sewer discharges into the Clapham Road. This work was also in progress on the 25th March. Pa rk Road 900-ft. 12-in. Pipe. Portland Place North 430-ft. 12-in. Pipe, and 230-ft. 9-in. Pipe. Portland Place South 510-ft. 12-in. Pipe, and 160-ft. 9-in. Pipe. Dorset Street 210-ft. 12-in. Pipe. 7 These Streets branch off the Clapham Road, into the Sewer of which their drainage is discharged. Doris Street 300-ft. 12-in. Pipe. Tyer's Terrace 160-ft. 15-in. pipe, and 190-ft. 12-in. Pipe.

Pear Tree Street 236-ft. 12-in. Pipe. In several of these Streets, Barrel Drains, constructed for the purpose of conveying the surface water from the road were found to be shallow, with very little fall, and not adapted for the purpose of carrying off soil drainage, some of them having been made previous to the construction of the deep Sewers ; in their place Pipe Sewers have been laid at a greater depth, and with such gradients as the circumstances in each case would allow. Water Lane St. George's Place 1,214-ft. 12-in. Pipe. Regent's Place 750-ft. 12-in. Pipe. herne Place 160-ft. 12-in. Pipe, 28G-ft. 9-in. ripe. The only drainage of these Streets was into open ditches, which in some cases ran both at the back and in front of them : the stench from these ditches gave rise to great complaint on the part of the occupiers of the houses, and were considered to be the cause of the unhealthy character of the neighbourhood. The benefit effected by these works is very great, and almost all the houses are now drained into the new Sewers. Spring Place, Wandsworth Road 1690-ft. 12-in. Pipe. This Sewer was constructed partly at the cost of the owners, who contributed £150 to the cost. This neighbourhood was in a very bad condition for want of drainage, and the majority of the houses are now drained into the new Sewers. 8 white's Lane, South Lambeth 173-ft., 2-ft. by 2-ft. Brick Barrel. 598-ft. 12-in. Pipe, 708-ft. 9-in. Pipe. This Sewer was constructed partly at the expense of the owners, who contributed £130. Barrington Crescent 900-ft. 12-in. Pipe, 560-ft. 9-in. This Sewer was constructed almost entirely at the cost of the owners, being a drainage of new property. Total of the lengths and sizes of Sewers constructed during the year being:— BRICK SEWERS. 4-ft. 6-in. by 3-ft.—3,870-ft.; 3-ft. 9-in. by 2-ft. 6-in.—3,990-ft.; 3-ft. by 2-ft.—5,680-ft.; 2-ft. by 2-ft.—173-ft. Total, 13,713-ft. PIPE SEWERS. 15-in.—160-ft. 12-in.—13,911 ft. 9-in.—3,002. Total, 17,073. Total length of Brick and Pipe, all sizes, 30,786-ft., or 5.83 miles. The total expenditure of the Vestry on account of the foregoing works will be found by reference to the statement at the end of the Report. Repairs and General Works, during the past year, have been confined to small incidental matters, consequent upon decay or accidental damage; these have been rather under the average, and do not include anything worthy of special notice. Flushing and Cleansing.— This branch of the work is discharged by men in the employ of the Vestry. The whole of the Sewers in the Parish, open and covered, are periodically travelled, and cleansed or flushed by water; and any stoppage in Sewers and Drains in the public way are examined and remedied without delay. House Drainage.—A large portion of this work has followed the construction of the new Sewers. Works upon private property undergo a supervision to secure their proper 9 execution, and that the regulations of the Vestry are conformed to. The number of applications during the year were 489, the number of houses drained with the sanction and under the control of the Vestry was 1,414. The amount paid into the office for openings into Sewers was £1,648 13s. 5d.; and the estimated cost of the private works in connection with these applications is £12,300. New Buildings.—There have been 26 notices given to the Vestry for building 87 new houses in the Parish, and in case of new ground being laid out, the proprietors have borne the whole, or greater part of the cost of making proper Sewers and surface Drainage. Mr. Stone, Barrington Crescent, paid £150; Mr. Abbott, White's Lane, paid £130 for Drainage of Estate ; Mr. West, for Drainage, Carroon Road, paid £60. Applications made to the Metropolitan Board of Works, for leave to erect shops in front of houses, are communicated to the Vestry for the purpose of enabling them to make any suggestion they may think fit, previous to the application being decided by the Metropolitan Board. In considering these applications, the intention of the Legislature to prevent the disfigurement of street fronts has always been kept in mind; but cases where no harm would ensue, have been favorably recommended to the Metropolitan Board, who have, in most cases, adopted the recommendation. The number of these during the last year was 36. SANITARY MATTERS. Between March 25th, 1857, and March 25th, 1858, there were 2,687 cases of Nuisance brought under the notice of the General Purposes Committee, by the Medical Officer and Inspectors. Of these, 1,495 cases referred to the state of 1,650 dwelling houses, rendered unwholesome by reason of their filthy and dilapidated condition, or of their foul cesspools, or of their defective 10 drains. In nearly all these cases, improvements, to a greater or less extent, have been effected. Twenty-eight cases referred to complaints arising from the carrying on of offensive trades. Several of these complaints were reported on specially by the Medical Officer, particularly those relating to Mr. Nash's Size Factory, in William Street; to the Phoenix Gas Works, in Kennington Lane; and to the South Western Railway Company's Japan Works, in the Wandsworth Road. The remaining 1,164 miscellaneous cases referred to a variety of subjects, including offensive ditches and drains, foul urinals, piggeries, cow sheds, slaughter-houses, and accumulations of dung and refuse. The following tabular statement shows the operations of the Vestry with regard to Nuisances:— TABLE I. PARISH OF ST. MARY, LAMBETH.

In most of these Cases, the Premises were visited several times before the cause of complaint was removed. 12 In the year 1857, there were 122 notices received of intention to apply for Slaughter House Licenses. There were 67 notices from the Inner Liberties, including 8 new cases, which were situated respectively,—3 in Lambeth Walk, 2 in the New Cut, 2 in the Cornwall Road, and 1 in Kennington Lane. There were 55 notices from the Outer Liberties, including 5 new cases, situated respectively in Chapel Road, Norwood; in Mount Pleasant, Brixton Hill; in Brixton Place; in Long Lane, Stockwell; and in Bath Street, Camberwell New Road. All the slaughter houses in both Districts were inspected, and eventually found to be in a satisfactory condition. They had all been recently cleansed and whitewashed, and many of them repaired and improved. The points insisted upon were free ventilation, good water supply, good paving, and efficient well-trapped drains. During the months of November and December, 1857, an inspection was made of all the cow houses in the Parish, amounting to 92, and at that time occupied by 830 cows. Altogether the condition of the cow yards was better than had been anticipated; but in several cases the premises were found to be in a very objectionable state: and in these, the owners received from the Inspectors of Nuisances preliminary notices requiring improvement, which, after more or less trouble, were satisfactorily attended to. The general sanitary state of the Parish, as indicated by its mortality, in the year 1857, is shown in the following Table, which gives the total number of births, the total number of deaths, the deaths under 5 years of age, and the deaths in the workhouses, which occurred in the entire Parish, and in each of its eight sub-divisions, during the entire year, and during each particular quarter of the year.

Had the mortality of Lambeth been proportionate to the mortality of the Metropolis, there would have been 3,528 deaths registered, instead of 3,076. TABLE III. Population in 1851.

General Repairs.—The whole of the Roads and Streets in charge of the Vestry have been under careful supervision, and the general repairs thereto, where requisite, attended to; the footways in many instances have been repaired with new York paving, and the gravel footpaths regulated and re-faced with fresh gravel. The Carriage Ways in the leading thoroughfares have been regulated and coated with broken Guernsey granite, (which material is used in the Inner Wards,) and with Kentish flints and Croydon gravel in the Out Wards; and all Roads and Streets are in good repair and condition. Watering and Cleansing.—The same system that was adopted last year as to the watering and cleansing has been continued this year, which, considering the extent and number of the Roads and Streets, has been found to give satisfaction. New Works and Improvements.—During the past year, the following works of importance have been executed, whereby considerable improvements have been effected. York Road.—The Footway from the Westminster Road to Griffin Street, on the South side, has been taken up and relaid with new 3-in. York paving, and the kerb re-set and jointed.

The Terrace, Kennington Park.—New Purbeck kerb has been laid throughout, and the footways and carriage-ways reformed, regulated, and faced with gravel. Gipsey House Hill, Norwood.—Great improvements have been effected in this Road, which was previously in a dangerous state for traffic, consequent on the rapid inclination of the road; this has been remedied by kerbing the footway and laying a new paved channel from the b 18 top of Westow Hill down to the railway arch, and entirely reforming the footpath and carriage-way, and making the same up, and coating with Croydon gravel. Park Road, Norwood.—The carriage-way has been raised, regulated, and coated with Croydon gravel, and the footpath under the cemetery wall has been reformed, and faced with fine Croydon gravel. Upper Tulse Hill.—New Purbeck kerb has been laid opposite the new houses near Roupell Road, the footpaths made up, regulated, and faced with fine Croydon gravel; and the carriage-way, which at this spot was narrow and inconvenient for traffic, has been widened and improved. New kerbing has been laid, and the footpaths made up and faced with fine gravel, opposite new buildings, &c., at Barrington Road, Cold Harbour Lane, Bedford Lane, Oval Road, and Grafton Villas, in Loughborough Park Road. In order to facilitate as far as possible an efficient means of watering the various roads, three new Wells have been sunk, and new pumps erected, at Stockwell Green, James Street, and Vauxhall Cross.

Harleyford Place.—The kerb has been taken up and re-set, and the footpath re-constructed, made up, and faced with fine Uxbridge gravel. In carrying out the above works, wherever any paving that was previously laid at the expense of the proprietors or inhabitants of the houses on the above line of Roads was found necessary to be disturbed to effect the improvements desired, the same has been re-laid at the expense of the Vestry ; whereby great public improvements have been effected, and private interests interfered with as little as possible. b 2 20 Works in Progress. Clapham Road.—New Purbeck kerb, and the footpaths re-constructed. Brixton Hill.—New Purbeck kerb, and the footpaths re-constructed, The above roads form the last portion of the works in execution on the footpaths of the Surrey and Sussex Trust Roads. Lyham Road.—This Road which has for some time been the subject of serious complaints in consequence of its filthy and unwholesome condition, is now undergoing a thorough and complete repair. The Vestry have come to an arrangement with the Wandsworth District Board of Works as to the boundaries of the Parishes, and maintenance of the Road; estimates have been prepared to entirely re-form and make the Road throughout, and the apportionment of the expense has been equitably arranged as between the Wandsworth District Board of Works, the inhabitants, and the Vestry. Richmond and Osborne Terraces.—New Purbeck kerb has been laid throughout on both sides, and the footpaths regulated. During the past year many of the Roads and Streets have been subjected to serious damage from the various Gas and Water Companies either driving new mains or removing old ones, by which the carriage and footways have been much obstructed and impaired. Attention has been paid to these matters, and the Parish has been re-imbursed for such damage to public thoroughfares; the amount received by the Vestry tor restoration of Roads, Alterations, Licences to remove Paving, 21 LIGHTING. During the past year the Vestry has received 65 memorials and applications for additional lighting in various parts of the Parish, and have erected 52 new lamps. The total number of lamps lighted by the Vestry at the present time is 2171. The number of lamps removed during the year for purposes of improvement have been 55. The prices paid by the Vestry for lighting, at per lamp, per annum, including painting and repairs, are as follows:—The Phoenix Gas Company £4 17s. 6d. (1058 lamps) ; The London £4 15s. (570 lamps); The South Metropolitan i?4 18s. 6d. (499 lamps); and The Crystal Palace £5 5s. (44 lamps). The total cost for lighting the Parish during the past year, has been £10,349 5s. 3d., and for new lamps and removals, .£349 3s. Id. A great improvement has been effected by numbering of the lamps with perforated zinc labels, by which all communications respecting their repair and lighting is greatly facilitated. In the last Annual Report, it was stated that the Gas Companies had allotted to each other a certain division of the Parish, and combined together to limit each Company to supply gas only in such district, in consequence of which competition has ceased, the price has been increased, and the arrangements in reference to lighting complicated. The importance of this subject soon became apparent to other Vestries, and at the invitation of the Vestry of Marylebone, this and other Vestries united to prevent such arrangement by the Gas Companies from working injuriously to the Gas Consumers of the Metropolis. It is now satisfactory to report, that after numerous meetings of deputations, and memorializing the Secretary of State, a Parliamentary Committee was appointed to enquire into the existing arrangements for supplying the Metropolis with gas. This Committee heard the evidence brought 22 before them, but being unable to conclude their labours, they adjourned until the next Session, when it is confidently hoped that some very important alterations in the law will be recommended to Parliament. The Vestry, in pursuing this matter, have been actuated by a desire, not only to improve the public lighting, but what they con-. sider of no less importance, to protect the interests of gas consumers generally from the injurious effects likely to result from such combination. The Crystal Palace Gas Company, which lights a portion of the Outer District of the Parish, applied to Parliament this Session for, and obtained an Act of Incorporation, in which there are clauses of a highly beneficial character to the public. The Lighting Committee, in conjunction with the Lewisham Board of Works, obtained certain amendments in the Bill, after which their opposition was withdrawn. The clauses referred to compel the Company to light all public lamps within 100 yards from the main ; fixes the quality or illuminating power of the gas; requires the Company to provide an apparatus to enable any party to test the quality of the gas, on obtaining an Order of Justices, and imposes a penalty, not exceeding £20, if the illuminating power should be less than the standard fixed by the Act. The Vestry regret that they are unable to report satisfactorily in reference to the quality and quantity of the gas supplied to the public lamps. Frequent complaints have been made to the various Companies, and their Engineers have been before the Lighting Committee upon this subject. For the purposeofobtaining some positive data to proceed upon, a series of observations and experiments have been made, and the subject is is still under consideration. Dr. Odling will test periodically, and report upon the illuminating power of the gas supplied in 23 the Parish; and it is hoped that the information thus obtained will tend to improvement, and prevent the Companies departing from their arrangements to maintain a proper supply. Irrespective of the subjects previously mentioned, others of an important character have occupied the attention of the Vestry, viz.—The operation, in a sanitary point of view, of the Metropolitan Market Act, 1851; the erection of conveniences for urinal accommodation; the required improvements in the Vestry Hall; and in considering and suggesting various amendments of the Metropolis Local Management Act. In reference to the first subject, that of improving the condition of slaughter houses:—By the Metropolitan Market Act 1851, it is provided that slaughter houses shall be licensed ; and under Section 131 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, one month's notice of the intention to apply for such license must be given to the Vestry, thus affording an opportunity of the grant of any license being opposed, if any cause existed for such a course being adopted, arising from want of drainage, or insufficient ventilation, &c., of the premises sought to be licensed. The proceedings adopted by the Medical Officer to give due effect to this section of the Act, have been previously adverted to. PUBLIC CONVENIENCES. By the 88th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, the Vestry is empowered to provide and maintain them. During the year, the Vestry have, as an experimental proceeding, caused one Urinal to be erected near the "Three Stags" Public House, at a cost of £85. 24- AMENDMENTS OF THE ACT. In putting the Act into practical operation, various defects were patent. The Vestry appointed a Committee to consider the required Amendments, and report thereon. Such Report was adopted by the Vestry on the 25th day of February last, and embraced various Amendments as to the recovery of cost of executing Drainage Works on private property, construction of Sewers in new streets, projections or encroachments in connection with new buildings, also as to paving or repairing streets, removal of road scrapings, ashes, and defacing lamp columns, &c. By direction of Vestry, a copy of such Report was forwarded to the Metropolitan Board of Works, it being the intention of such Board to introduce in the ensuing Session of Parliament a Bill to amend the Metropolis Local Management Act in many important points. In conclusion, the Vestry, in their practical operations and works executed during the past year, have endeavoured to effect public improvements at as small an increase of taxation as possible.
