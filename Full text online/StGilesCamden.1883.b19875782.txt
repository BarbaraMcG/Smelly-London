This comprises the expenses connected with Main Drainage, Fire Brigade, Bridges, Improvements, Sinking Fund, and the General Expenses of that Board. The Precept of the School Board for London amounted to £10,359 : 17s. 4d. These sums, making together £19,910 : 13s. 5d., are nearly one-third of the amount raised by the Board under its precepts.

The Decease and Resignation of Members. Mr. Frederick Latreille, of No. 5, Bloomsbury Place, for over 25 years a most useful and active member of the Board, died in the month of November, 1883. The Board, in conveying to his Widow and family their sincere sympathy, took the occasion to express their high appreciation of his admirable talent, ability and courtesy, and the great loss the District had sustained by his death. The Board also received, with great regret, the intelligence of the decease of Mr. Robert Parsons, of No. 6, Torrington Place, a Member of this Board for nearly ten years, who died suddenly in March of the present year, and they have also to regret the resignation of George Ledbitter Wingate, Esq., for several years a Member of this Board. ( 10 ) Railway Bills of the Present Session, The Plans and Notices deposited with the Clerk of the Board were:— (1) The London Central Electric Railway from the Railway authorized by the Charing Cross and Waterloo Electric Railway Act, 1882, and from Piccadilly Circus to Newgate Street. (2) The Mid-London Electric Railway from the Marble Arch to the Royal Exchange. Both schemes fell through, the first being thrown out by the Select Committee of the House of Commons, and the second through the Promoters failing to make the usual Parliamentary deposit. The projects are more fully referred to in the Surveyor's Report. The Electric Lighting Act, 1882. The Provisional Orders granted by the Board of Trade to the Metropolitan (Brush) Electric Light and Power Company, Limited, to supply electricity to the north side of High Holborn and New Oxford Street, and the east side of Tottenham Court Road to Bayley Street; and to the PilsenJoel and General Electric Light Company, Limited, to supply the south side of High Holborn and New Oxford Street to Little Queen Street, were confirmed by Parliament ; but neither Company has yet made the necessary deposit or appropriation of Capital, and as the Board of Trade, upon the recommendation of the Board, has declined to extend the period of six months allowed by the Act, the Provisional Orders are at an end. Sale of Food and Drags Act, 1875. Two hundred and thirty-nine articles have been analysed during the year, consisting of samples of bread, butter, ( 11 ) milk, cheese, coffee, jams, condensed milk, pepper, mustard, pickles, flour, green peas, confectionery, sausages, tinned meats, rum, gin, biscuits, vinegar, and drugs. In 30 instances the samples were found to be adulterated, and proceedings were accordingly instituted, and convictions obtained. The fines and costs imposed by the Police Magistrates, and recovered, amounted to £41 : 19s. 6d. Dr. Redwood still continues to be the Analyst of the Board. His report will be found at page 93. Nuisances Removal Acts. During the year 13 owners of property in the district having failed to comply with the Board's orders, have been proceeded against before the Magistrates, and the necessary works ordered to be carried out. Dwellings of the Poor, A Royal Commission was appointed on the 4th of March of the present year, to enquire into the housing of the working classes. The Commission has already held several sittings. Telephone Wires. A Bill was introduced into Parliament by the United Telephone Company, by which they sought powers to carry wires for telephonic purposes under and over the public ways within the Metropolis, and for other purposes. As the Bill did not propose to reserve to Local Authorities a power of control over the wires, which had in the case of telegraph wires been given to them by the various Telegraph Acts, your Board considered it advisable to oppose the same, and accordingly lodged a Petition against the Bill. ( 12 ) The Bill was read a first time on the 21st February and referred to a Select Committee, but the Agents of the Bill now state it will not be proceeded with this Session. Gas Supply. During the year 1882-3, a scheme was submitted for the amalgamation of the Gas Light and Coke Company and the London Gas Company, both of which Companies supplied gas within your district, the line of demarcation following the line of High Street, Broad Street, High Holborn, and Southampton Row as far as Theobalds Road. The Gas Light and Coke Company supplying the district north and west of that line, and the London Gas Company the district south and east of it. The price of the gas supplied by the London Gas Company was 2s. per 1,000 cubic feet, the Company's initial price being 3s. 6d. per 1,000 for 14-candle gas. The price charged by the Gas Light and Coke Company being 3s. per 1,000 cubic feet, their initial price being 3s. 9d. per 1,000 cubic feet for 16candle gas : in both cases the Companies having the power of increasing their dividends above the statutory 10 per cent, at the rate of ¼ per cent. for every id. reduction per 1,000 feet in the price charged for the gas. On the Gas Light and Coke Company undertaking never to charge for the public lamps, throughout the whole of the area supplied by it, a higher price than that charged by the South Metropolitan Gas Company on the south side of the river, and which price was based upon an initial charge of 3s. 6d. per 1,000 cubic feet, the scheme was confirmed by the Board of Trade and came into effect on the 1st of July, 1883. In October 1883, a further scheme was submitted by the Gas Light and Coke Company for its amalgamation with the South Metropolitan Gas Company. ( 13 ) Your Board considered that the proposed amalgamation, by removing the element of comparison of charges for gas lighting between two Companies, was undesirable and opposed to the interests of the ratepayers of the Metropolis. Resolutions to this effect were forwarded to the Board of Trade, who ultimately declined to confirm the scheme. The price of gas for public lamps in the district was reduced on the 1st of January, 1884, to 2s. 8d. per 1,000 feet, at which price it now stands. Chalets de Toilette et de Necessite, In 1880, application was made to your Board for permission to erect Chalets, for convenience of men and women, in certain public ways of your District. The sites proposed for such Chalets being in High Holborn, at its junction with New Oxford Street, and in Broad Street near to Bloomsbury Street. Skeleton models of the proposed erections were at that time placed on those sites, in order to judge of the extent of public way that would be occupied by the proposed structures, and their effect on the public traffic. Your Board, after lengthy consideration of the subject at that time, resolved not to sanction their erection. In October last, application was again made by the Chalet Company, to erect a Chalet in Broad Street, at the same site as that before proposed. The matter was again fully considered, and your Board again resolved not to sanction such erections within the District. Water Supply. A Bill was introduced into Parliament by the Corporation of the City of London, by which the Water Companies supplying the Metropolis were to be bound to supply water ( 14 ) for domestic purposes by measure. The scale of charges proposed by the Bill being at the rate of 6d per 1,000 gallons, with a minimum charge of 3s. per Quarter. The Bill also provided that the rateable value, according to the latest poor rate assessment, was to be taken as the " annual value," in all cases where the Water Companies were authorized to charge according to value. Your Board considered that a basis of charge according to quantity of water used was more equitable to the consumer than a per-centage upon the annual value of the property, with the addition of extra charges for W. C'.s., high pressure, &c., &c., and accordingly petitioned the Legislature in favour of the Bill. The Bill was read a first time on the 11th day of February, but the second reading was refused on the 11th day of March. The Metropolitan Board of Works introduced a Bill into Parliament authorizing that Board to make and oppose applications to Parliament, and to prosecute and defend legal proceedings relating to the supply of water in the Metropolis. The Bill was read a second time in the House of Commons on the 27th February 1884, and now stands for considei'ation in the whole house. No action was taken by your Board with respect to this Bill. Dwelling-houses Inspection. A Bill for the sanitary inspection of dwelling-houses, under the title of "The Sanitary Inspection Act, 1884," was introduced into the House of Commons and read a first time on the 6th February, 1884. ( 15 ) The object of the Bill is to require that every Local Authority within the United Kingdom should appoint Sanitary Inspectors to carry the Act into effect, such appointment to receive the sanction and confirmation of the Local Government Board. It further provided that plans and descriptions of all new buildings should be submitted to such Sanitary Inspector for his approval, and laid down certain rules as to Sanitary Appliances which should apply to all such new buildings. That on the completion of such buildings, the Inspector should grant certificates as to their proper observance before such buildings could be occupied, and that the Inspector should inspect all such Sanitary Appliances in all the houses within the district at least once a year. Your Board considered that the proposed Act was unnecessary, that all necessary powers to appoint Inspectors and make regulations as to the Sanitary Appliances of houses within the Metropolis were sufficiently provided for by existing enactments, and accordingly petitioned the House against the Bill. The Bill was read a first time on the 6th February, 1884, and stands for second reading on the 30th July. The death of the late Clerk to the Board. The Board has in the past year sustained, by the death of its Clerk, the late Mr. John Henry Jones, the loss of an esteemed and faithful servant. He held the appointment of Clerk to the Board for 10 years, and invariably discharged the many important duties intrusted to him with great zeal, discretion, and firmness.

Marchmont Street. Bernard Street. Montague Street. Brunswick Square. Russell Square. Kenton Street. Upper Bedford Place. Upper Montague Street. New Sewers. The following lengths of new sewers were constructed during the year:— Torrington Square 195 feet lineal of brick sewer 4 ft. x2 ft. 6 in. internal dimensions. Little Torrington Street 278 do. do. Torrington Mews 342 do. do. Lincoln's Inn Fields 664 ft. run 12-in. pipe sewer. * The cost of this wood paving (£56: 4f. 3d.) was defrayed by the Inns of Court Hotel Company. c 2 (36) The old sewer in Torrington Street for a length of 146 feet, and 336 feet in length of the sewer in Torrington Mews East, were underpinned to give the sewers additional depth. Street Cleansing. The cleansing of the public carriage-ways was performed by a staff of men employed by the Board, consisting of 1 foreman, 3 gangers, and 31 sweepers. Two sweeping machines, drawn by horses, were also used in sweeping the paved carriage-ways. The street sweepings were carted away by contract, and amounted to a total of 12,303 loads. The carriage-ways of High Holborn, New Oxford Street, Tottenham Court Road, Great and Little Queen Streets, High Street, Hart Street, Vernon Place, Great and Little ' St. Andrew Streets, Southampton Row, Bedford Place, Gower Street, and the east side of Torrington Square, were washed on several occasions during the year by means of watering carts and the machine brooms. The cost of this washing is included in the two items of cost for street cleansing and street watering given hereafter. Street-orderly Boys. Ten boys and one man (acting as ganger) were employed during the year in cleansing the public footways in the District during wet and sloppy weather, and in dry weather in collecting the horse droppings on the surfaces of the wood and asphalte pavings in High Holborn, New Oxford Street, Hart Street, High Street, and Little Queen Street. (37) Cost of Street Cleansing. The total cost of street cleansing for the year 1883-4 was as follows:— £ s. d. Wages of men and boys 2,114 5 3 Brooms, scrapers, shovels, &c., and clothing for men and boys 256 8 3 Cartage of slop and street sweepings, hire of horses for street sweeping and sand distributing machines 2,368 4 8 Total cost of cleansing for the year £4,738 18 2 Street Watering. The street watering was performed by contract, the contractor supplying all carts, horses, and drivers required, at a fixed price for the whole work for the year. In view of a possible outbreak of Cholera in the Metropolis, in about the middle of the year your Board considered it advisable that the market streets in south St. Giles, which had previously been cleansed once only on Sunday mornings, viz., between the hours of 6 and 9, should be twice cleansed, firstly between the hours of 12 and 3 a.m., and again between 12 noon and 2.30 p.m.; and that after such second cleansing the said streets, as well as certain other streets inhabited by the poorer classes within the district, should be copiously watered—a small quantity of carbolic acid being added to the water. This cleansing and watering has been continued to the present time, and, it is believed, with beneficial effect. (38) The water used for street watering and washing was 4,336,000 gallons. £ s. d. The amount paid for water, meter hire, repairs to stand-posts, &c., was 229 4 0 To contractor for horses, carts, and men 738 12 10 Total £967 16 10 Removal of Dust. The dust and ashes were removed from the houses in the District by contract, the contractor providing all necessary men, horses, and carts, and performing the whole work at a cost of £1,757:18s. 4d. In July last, your Board employed an additional Inspector, whose sole duty is to make a house to house inspection of the dust-bins within the District, and see that the same are properly emptied when requisite. This inspection has been continued up to the present time with most satisfactory results. The number of inspections made from 27th July, 1883 (when the Inspector commenced his duties), until the 25th March, 1884, was 41,168. Limewhiting Courts. The walls of buildings at the entrances to the Mews, Yards, Courts, Alleys, &c., in the District were twice cleansed and limewhited during the year, at a cost of £59:6s. 2d. Public Urinals. The public urinals in the District belonging to the Board are 18 in number and contain 51 compartments; 11 of the urinals containing 41 compartments, have water laid on to them, the others are without a water supply. The whole are cleansed daily by the Board's workmen. ( 39 ) LIST OF PUBLIC URINALS IN THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Bainbridge Street 5 compartments, Water Supply laid on. Chenies Mews, north 3 do. do. do.

The public urinal in Brewer Street, being strongly complained of by some of the inhabitants of adjacent properties, was closed temporarily with the view of ascertaining if its permanent removal would be likely to cause much nuisance or inconvenience. Observations were made of the site for several weeks after such closing, and, as no complaint was made and no nuisance observed to arise in consequence, it was removed permanently, and the wall against which it had been placed made good in January, 1884. Public Lighting. The rearrangement of the public lamps and the substitution of new lamp-posts and circular lamps for those of the old patterns were proceeded with during the year; the (40) total number of the new lamp-posts and lanterns in the district at Lady Day, 1884, was 604. Street Refuges. No additional street crossing refuges were formed during the year. The number now existing in the St. Giles District is as follows:— In Bloomsbury Street south end, by Broad Street „ Broad Street west of Endell Street Do. east of Endell Street Do. by Drinking Fountain „ Endell Street north end, by Broad Street „ Guilford Street west end, by Russell Square „ High Holborn by Little Queen Street Do. at junction with New Oxford Street „ High Street north end, by New Oxford Street „ New Oxford Street east of its junction with Bloomsbury St. Do. west of its junction with Bloomsbury St. Do. by Hart Street Do. by Thorney Street Do. west end, by Tottenham Court Road „ Theobald's Road west end, by Southampton Row „ Tottenham Court Rd. south end, by New Oxford Street. They are all well lighted, and afford great assistance tc pedestrians in crossing the carriage-ways. Improvements. A small improvement was effected in the public way of Gate Street on its south side, by setting back a portion of the line of frontage (40 feet in length), of No. 1, Prince's Square, which projected 2 feet beyond the general line of frontage. The amount to be paid to the owner of the (41) property for the land thrown into the street is £130, one-half of which will be contributed by the Metropolitan Board of Works. Two small improvements were also effected at the entrances into Wild Court and Little Wild Street from Great Wild Street, the former thoroughfare for a length of 51 feet being set back 2 feet 6 inches, and the latter thoroughfare for a length of 55 feet being set back 5 feet 8 inches. The amount to be paid to the School Board of London, who were the owners of the property, is £250, one-half of which amount will also be contributed by the Metropolitan Board of Works. London Central Electric Railway. Plans and Notices for this scheme were duly deposited at the Private Bill Office, to be brought before the present Session of Parliament. It was a project for the construction of railways between Charing Cross, Regent Circus, Piccadilly, and the General Post Office in St. Martin's-le-Grand. It comprised firstly, a line of railway to commence in Northumberland Avenue, by a junction with the authorized Charing Cross and Waterloo Electric Railway, proceeding thence beneath the east side of Trafalgar Square to St. Martin's Place, and thence following the line of new street authorized to be formed by the Metropolitan Board of Works between Charing Cross and Tottenham Court Road, as far as to the west end of Dudley Street, where it was to effect a junction with another line of railway which was (42) to commence at the north-east side of Regent Circus, Piccadilly, and proceed thence beneath the new street authorised to be formed by the Metropolitan Board of Works between Regent Circus and New Oxford Street, as far as to the west end of Dudley Street. The railway was then to enter the St. Giles District and proceed along the line of the proposed new street to New Oxford Street, by Hart Street, and thence beneath the eastern end of New Oxford Street, High Holborn, Holborn Circus, Snow Hill, Holborn Viaduct, and Newgate Street to St. Martin's-leGrand. The railway was to be underground, and almost entirely beneath the public ways; its proposed depth in your district was about 30 feet. It was to consist of one line of tunnel and to be worked solely by electricity. The carriages were to hold about 30 people each, and resemble much in size and weight an ordinary omnibus, and be run singly at frequent intervals. The proposed stations within the St. Giles District were at the west end of Dudley Street; in New Oxford Street, by Thorney Street; and in High Holborn at the north-east corner of Little Queen Street. Ihe formation of the proposed railway would have caused considerable interference with the sewers and other works of your Board, and with the drains from private houses, and likewise have caused considerable inconvenience to the public traffic while the works were in progress. Your Board accordingly presented a Petition to Parliament against the Bill. (43) The Bill was introduced into the House of Commons, read a first time, and duly referred to a Committee, but prior to the meeting of this Committee, the Promoters of the Bill entered into negotiation with your Board, which resulted in their undertaking to insert certain clauses in their Bill, by which the objections of your Board would be fully met. They also entered into a written Agreement with you, by which the Promoters bound themselves at their own cost to widen the public way of Little Queen Street, so far as they acquired property in that street, and also to contribute a certain sum of money towards the cost of the Board's opposition to their Bill. Your opposition was accordingly withdrawn, but the Bill was ultimately rejected by the Committee, who reported to the House that they considered its Preamble was not proved. The Mid-London Electric Railway. This was another scheme for which plans and notices were deposited at the Private Bill Office. It comprised a line of underground railway commencing at the west end of Oxford Street, proceeding thence beneath the public way of Oxford Street, New Oxford Street, High Holborn, Holborn Circus, Snow Hill, Holborn Viaduct, Newgate Street, and Cheapside, to a termination in Cornhill near to the south-west corner of the Royal Exchange. It was to consist of a double line of tunnel almost entirely beneath public ways, its depth beneath the street surface in New Oxford Street and High Holborn being from 70 to 80 feet. (44) This railway was also proposed to be worked entirely by electricity, and each train was to consist of three carriages of very light construction, each capable of holding 30 passengers. The stations proposed to be formed in your District were in High Holborn, one by Great Turnstile, and the other on the vacant land adjoining your Board's Offices. This proposed Railway followed nearly the same line as has been several times projected in previous Sessions of Parliament, under the titles of the Mid-London Railway and Mid-Metropolitan Railway, but at a much greater depth beneath the street surface than either of the previous schemes. The Promoters of the Bill did not comply with the Standing Orders of the Houses of Parliament, and it was accordingly not proceeded with. Electric Lighting. During the year 1882, an Act of Parliament was passed, known as the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, its purpose being to " facilitate and regulate the supply of Electricity in Great Britain and Ireland," and with that object the Act gives very large powers to the Board of Trade, empowering that Board to grant Licenses and Provisional Orders, to authorize Local Authorities, Companies, and persons to supply electricity within certain areas. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, notices were served on your Board by the four following Electric Lighting Companies, viz.: the Metropolitan (Brush) Electric Light Company, Limited; the Edison Electric (45) Light and Power Company, Limited; the Swan United Electric Light Company, Limited; the Pilsen-Joel and General Electric Light Company, Limited; all of whom sought power to supply electricity within the whole or certain portions of the St. Giles District. These applications were opposed by you before the Board of Trade, with the view of obtaining such amendments in the proposed Orders as you considered advisable, and after considerable negotiations with the Companies and the Board of Trade, and after a "Local Enquiry" held by an Inspector appointed by that Board, the Board of Trade granted Provisional Orders to two of the Companies, viz:— The Metropolitan (Brush) Electric Light Company, Limited, and the Pilsen-Joel and General Electric Light Company, Limited, to enable them to light certain areas within the St. Giles District, the other two Companies referred to withdrawing their applications. These Provisional Orders gave effect to many of the objections made by you, and altogether placed your Board in a much better position than they would have been if the powers originally sought for by the Promoters had been granted them. The Orders were subsequently confirmed by the Legislature and became Law, under the titles of the Electric Lighting Orders Confirmation (No. 5) Act, 1883, and the Electric Lighting Orders Confirmation (No. 6) Act, 1883. By the first-named Order, the Metropolitan (Brush) Electric Light Company, Limited, was authorized to supply electricity, for lighting and other purposes, to the portion of your District lying north of New Oxford Street and High Holborn, the larger portion of which (bounded on (46) the north by Bayley Street, Bedford Square, Montague Street, and Russell Square), was to be supplied within two years after the passing of the Act (25th August 1883). The Order further stipulated that the Company were to set aside £20,000 as a separate Capital, for the purposes of carrying this into effect, and also to deposit a sum of £2,000 with the Board of Trade, within six months of the passing of the Act, as a security for the Undertaking. The Order (No. 6) Act authorized the Pilsen-Joel and General Electric Light Company, Limited, to supply electricity within an area lying south of New Oxford Street and High Holborn, and including Little Queen Street and Gate Street. This Company was to appropriate £11,500 as a separate Capital, with a deposit of £1,000 within six months from the passing of the Act (25th August 1883.) Neither of the two Companies referred to made the necessary deposits, but on the 25th day of January, 1884, the Metropolitan Brush Company, and the 7th day of February, 1884, the Pilsen-Joel and General Electric Light Company, applied to the Board of Trade for extension of the time for making such deposits, the first-named Company asking for six months' extension, and the latter Company for twelve months' extension. The Board of Trade asked for your opinion as to granting such extensions of time, and, on your objecting to the same, the applications were refused by the Board of Trade. The result of the whole proceedings, after much labour and heavy expense to your Board, is, that with the exception of a form of Provisional Order which it may be (47) assumed future Orders will have to follow, your District remains in precisely the same position, as far as Electric Lighting is concerned, as before the said Orders were applied for.

The length of the streets arid roads is more than 1,600 miles. The area of London being 122 square miles is equal to a square of about 11 miles to the side. "Elevation.—The population of London resides at a mean elevation of 39 ft. above Trinity high-water mark; the elevation varying from 11 ft. below high-water mark in Plumstead Marshes, to 429 ft. above high-water mark in Hampstead. "Houses.—At the Census in 1881, there were within this area 486,186 inhabited houses, containing an average of 7.8 persons to a house, exactly corresponding with the proportion in 1861 and 1871. "Annual Rateable Value.—The annual rateable value of property in the metropolis in April, 1881, as assessed in accordance with the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, was equal to £27,402,509.

( 53 ) THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report of the vital statistics of the District, for the "Registration year 1883," which terminated December 31st. St. Giles District. Area in statute acres, 245. Number of Inhabited Houses (Census 1881), 3,968. Density of population, 185 to an acre. Population at Census 1881 45,257. Estimated decrease of population (in the ten years), 1872-82 6,697. Estimated population 1883 46,732. Average number of persons in each house (Census 1881), 11-4. The average elevation of the district is about 68 feet above Trinity high-water mark. Rateable value, £365,311. ( 54 ) Marriages and Marriage-rate. Last year 364 marriages were celebrated in the parish churches, Roman Catholic, and Nonconformist places of worship, and at the Superintendent Registrar's Office, all of the buildings being situated in the District. O O Name of Building. Denomination. Number of Marriages. Parish Church, St. Giles in the Fields Established Church . 128 Parish Church, St. George, Bloomsbnry ditto 126 Superintendent Registrar's OiRce 62 Sardinian Chapel, Sardinia Street Roman Catholic 23 Bloomsbnry Chapel, Bloomsbnry Street Baptist 12 Little Wild Street Chapel ditto 3 Great Queen Street Chapel Wesleyan Methodist . 8 Eglise Suisse, Endell Street Swiss Reformed 1 Church . Kingsgate Chapel, Kingsgate Street Baptist 0 Keppel Street Chapel ditto 1 Total 364 The marriage-rate, i.e. persons married per 1,000 of the population, was 15.5, against 15.2 for the preceding year. The average rate for the five years being 15.0 per 1,000, the rate for the past year was 0'5 above the average. The marriages celebrated in London numbered 35,297, giving a proportion of 17.8 persons married to 1,000 inhabitants. In the United Kingdom the marriages of 504,292 persons were registered, equal to a rate of 14.1 per 1,000. In England and Wales, the marriages were 408,698, and equal to a rate of 15.3 per 1,000. ( 55 ) Births and Birth-rate. The births of 1,436 children were registered in 1883; of these 741 were males, and 695 females; 1,075 belonged to the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, and 361 to that of St. George, Bloomsbury. The birth-rate was equal to 30.7 per 1,000, 1.0 above that of the preceding year, and nearly 2.0 above the decennial average. The birth-rate, &c., in the Sub-Districts will be shown in the following table:— Birth-rate in St. Giles and its Sub-Districts in 1883, and the Ratio of Births to Population, &c. Registbation Sub-Districts. Estimated Population. Births. Ratio of Births to Population. Rate per 1,000. Average Birth-rate per 1,000 for 10 years 1873—82.

The birth-rate for the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields was 35'7, and the birth-rate for the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury was 2T6. The births registered in London numbered 133,656, and were in the proportion of 33'9 to 1,000 inhabitants. This was the lowest birth-rate recorded since 1880, in which year the rate was only 33'6. ( 56 ) The Registrar-General says "The natural growth of the population of London, that is to say, its increase irrespectively of immigration and emigration, since the last Census, has by itself been nearly at the rate of 1,000 per week." The births in England and Wales were 889,815, and the birth-rate was 33.2 per 1,000. The births in the United Kingdom were 1,132,499, and the birth-rate was 31.8 per 1,000. Deaths and Death-rate. The deaths of 1,006 persons were registered in 1883: of these 522 were males, and 484 females; 791 belonged to the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, and 215 to the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury. The deaths registered in the three Sub-districts were :— St. George, Bloomsbury 215 St. Giles, South 540 St. Giles, North 251 Whole District 1,006 Equal to a death-rate of 21.5 per 1,000. This death-rate must be corrected by deducting 40 deaths of non-parishioners, who died at the workhouse, Broad Street—the British Lying-in-hospital, Endell Street, —and the "Infants' Home," 35, Great Coram Street; and by adding the deaths of 164 parishioners, who died in the public hospitals and institutions situated out of the district. The information of these hospital deaths, which is now supplied to me weekly from the Registrar-General's Office, by order of your Board, is very valuable both for sanitary and statistical purposes. ( 57 ) The 164 deaths are added to the returns of the local registrars in order to obtain the actual death-rate. These corrections are shown in the following table:— Death-rate in St. Giles and its Sub-Districts in 1883, and the Ratio of Deaths to Population, &c. Registration Sub-Districts. Estimated Population. Deaths (Corrected). Hatio of Deaths to Population. Rate per 1,000. Average Death-rate for 10 years, 1873-82.

The death-rate for the whole parish of St. Giles-in-theFields was 29.7 per 1,000. The death-rate for the whole parish of St. George, Bloomsbury was 17.5 per 1,000. The deaths registered in London in the year, numbered 80,578, and were in the proportion of 20.4 per 1,000 inhabitants. This was the lowest death-rate on record in London. The highest death-rate as yet recorded was in 1849, when it reached 30.1, mainly owing to the great mortality from Cholera. The deaths in the United Kingdom were 695,909, and equal to a rate of 19.5 per 1,000. ( 58 ) The deaths in England and Wales were 522,662, and equal to a rate of 19.5 per 1,000. The following table will show how generally the Metropolitan Hospitals are made use of by the sick poor: as 164 represents the deaths of our parishioners, the number of patients relieved and cured would necessarily be much greater.

Two hundred and sixty infants died under 1 year of age, which gives 1 death for every 5.5 births, and 22.2 per cent, to total deaths. Four hundred and forty-seven children died before they reached 5 years of age, which gives 1 death for every 3.2 births, and 38.2 per cent, to total deaths. The Deaths among Persons above 60 years of age. Two hundred and forty-four persons died between 60 and 80 years, and 39 at 80 years and upwards. ( 59 ) These 283 deaths give 1 death for every 4-l registered deaths. Uncertified Deaths. Of the 1,170 deaths recorded in Table 3, Appendix, 4 only were uncertified, i.e.. no certificate of the cause of J > " death was produced to the local registrar's from a duly qualified registered medical practitioner. It is satisfactory to find that the 4 persons whose deaths are mentioned above were attended by Medical Students or Mid wives. In all London, 984 cases or 1.22 per cent, of the deaths registered, the cause of death was not certified either by a coroner or by a registered medical practitioner. The Workhouse, Broad Street. There were 280 pauper deaths during the year, viz.:— 206 at the Workhouse. 56 at the Central Sick Asylum, Cleveland Street. 1 „ Highgate Infirmary. 2 „ Edmonton „ 5 „ Darenth „ 4 „ Caterham ,, 6 „ Stockwell Fever Hospital. Public Mortuary and Coroner's Court. From the opening of the new building in April, 1883, to the end of the year, 53 bodies were received, 25 postmortem examinations made, and 44 inquests held. Inquests. There were 99 inquests; 19 of the deaths occurred in St. George, Bloomsbury, and 80 in St. Giles-in-the-Fields. ( 60 ) Sixty-nine of the deaths were from natural causes, 23 from accidents, 4 from suicidal and 3 from wilful causes. The following table shows the causes of death. Causes of Death.

During the year there were 168 poor women delivered in the hospital, and 170 children were born there, including 2 sets of twins, 94 were males or 55.2 per cent., and 76 were females or 44.7 per cent. There were 8 still-horn children or 4-7 per cent., of whom 3 were males and 5 females. Previous to their confinement, 20 of the mothers resided in St. Giles, 11 in St. George, Bloomsbury, the rest in various parts of the metropolis, and the suburbs. ( 61 ) Only 3 deaths occurred in the hospital, viz. 1 mother, and 2 children, the adult patient aged 19 died from "septicaemia after labour," the two children were born prematurely and lived but a few days. Attention shoidd be drawn to the fact that, under the continued antiseptic treatment in the hospital, the mortality amongst the mothers has decreased each year. In the out-patients' department there were 542 deliveries, and 3 deaths (adults). The Infants' Home, 35, Great Coram Street. Five infants described as children of "female domestic servants," died in this home during the year. The causes of death were "diarrhœa" 3, "convulsions" 1, and "atrophy "1. The Bloomsbury Dispensary, Streatham Street. The number of new cases treated at this dispensary in 1883 was 52,955, a slight increase on the previous year. 715 patients were visited at their own homes: the casualties were 1,297. 68 of the cases terminated fatally. Zymotic Diseases. The deaths in England and Wales from the seven principal zymotic diseases, viz., small-pox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping-cough, fever, and diarrhoea, were 58,972, equal to a death-rate of 2.20 per 1,000. The deaths from these diseases in London were 10,801, equal to a death-rate of 2.7 per 1,000. The deaths in St. Giles District were 127, equal to a death-rate of 2.7 per 1,000, against 3.3 per 1,000 for the preceding year. ( 62 ) Small-pox.—There were 134 deaths from this disease in the Metropolis, but no death occurred from it in this District; only two cases of the disease were reported, one in August at the "Bells," Drury Lane, the other in November at Tavistock Street, that of a Medical Student (a lodger) belonging to St. Bartholomews' Hospital, where probably he contracted the complaint. Measles was less fatal than in 1882; the deaths were 31, but above the average. Scarlet Fever.—There were 16 deaths, all children; the number was considerably below the average. Diphtheria, which showed an increasing fatality all over the country, was also prevalent in this District. The deaths from it in St. Giles for the 8 years, 1872-9, were 22. but increased during the 3 years, 1880-2 to 41, and last year there were 19 deaths (all children) recorded. Whooping-cough on the other hand showed a marked decline in fatality, only 9 children died from it, whilst 24 perished from the same disease in 1882, and even in that year the numbers were 10 below the average. Fever, which includes typhus, enteric or typhoid, and simple continued fevers, was slightly above the average. Though happily typhus was entirely absent from us, typhoid was unusually prevalent: 17 deaths occurred in our district and at Stockwell Hospital, and several cases were removed to hospital which recovered. Three children died from simple continued fever. Diarriicea was again below the average; there were 32 deaths, of these 21 were infants under 1 year of age, and 5 between 1 and 5 years of age. ( 63 ) As there were outbreaks of cholera in Egypt it was thought the disease might extend to places which are in frequent and rapid communication with England, and that it was possible cases of the disease might before long be brought into the ports of this country. The Local Government Board summoned the Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health to meet their principal Medical Officer Dr. Buchanan in consultation on the matter. At the meeting certain precautionary measures were advised, which your Board in common with the Boards of other Metropolitan Districts adopted, but happily the calamity of a cholera outbreak did not visit the country. Ambulances. Since March, 1883, the ambulances belonging to the Guardians of the two parishes have not been used for the removal of pauper cases of infectious sickness to hospital, that duty being now carried out by the managers of the Metropolitan Asylum District Board, who employ their own staff for the purpose. Your Board has however purchased one of the ambulances, formerly the property of the Guardians, and it is retained at the stone yard for the conveyance of infectious cases of the non-pauper class. Mr. Shrimpton, carman, of 25, Arthur Street, has undertaken to find horse and driver at a fixed charge of ten shillings for each removal: the friends of the patient have to defray this amount, and are expected to send a proper attendant to accompany the patient on the journey. Pulmonary Diseases. (EXCLUDING CONSUMPTION.) This class of diseases, as usual, caused the heaviest fatality. The deaths were "Bronchitis" 214, "Pneumonia" v ' ( 64 ) 40, "Pleurisy" 6,'"Asthma" 4, "Laryngitis" 1, other " Lung diseases" 8; a total of 273, and equal to a rate of 5'8 per 1,000. Tubercular Diseases. There were 170 deaths, equal to a death-rate of 3'6 per 1,000; Phthisis or Consumption alone accounting for 149 deaths in this order. Only 16 of the deaths occurred under 20 years of age, the heaviest mortality being between 20 and 60 years. Infantile Diseases. Two hundred and sixty infants died under 1 year of age, and 187 children between 1 and 5 years of age. The principal diseases were "Atrophy and Debility" 67, "Premature Birth" 28, "Tubercular Meningitis" or Water on the Brain 26, "Teething" 13, and "Convulsions" 31. The total deaths were 29 in excess of the preceding year. Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868. (Mr. McCULLOCH TOKRENS, M.P.) Your Board being the Local Authority under the abovementioned Act, I reported the following houses as being dangerous to health, and unfit for human habitation, viz:— Nos. 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, and 62 the Colonnade, in the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury. A total of 14 houses, inhabited by 228 persons, 122 adults and 106 children. The adjacent houses on the same side of the Colonnade, belonging to St. Pancras, have been similarly dealt with by the Medical Officer of Health for that district. (65 ) Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1875. (The Right Hon. SIR R. CROSS, M.P.) The Metropolitan Board of Works being the Local Authority under this Act, I made an official representation to that body of the following area in the parish of St. Gilesin-the-Fields, as being unfit for human habitation. The places comprised within the area, with the number of house, and of the inhabitants are as follows :— Locality. Number of Houses. Number of Inhabitants. Shelton Street 36 686 Parker Street 21 269 Macklin Street 18 376 Drury Lane 2 21 Kennedy Court 8 145 Star Court 11 82 Cross Lane 8 96 Chapel Yarl 4 47 108 1,722 Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act. 1875. LITTLE CORAM STREET AREA. I am pleased to report that the Trustees of the Peabody Fund, having finally arranged with the leaseholders at Little Coram Street, have commenced the erection of eight blocks of buildings to contain 420 rooms. When I found that the contractors were excavating for the erection of the new buildings on this area, I drew the attention of Mr. Crouch, the Secretary of the Peabody Fund, to the fact that a large piece of the land had been used for several years as a shoot for all kinds of refuse, and suggested to him that great care should be taken in the removal of the rubbish. I am E ( 66 ) informed that this was strictly attended to, that all the refuse has been carted away, and that no bad effect has been caused to the health of that part of the district. The four wretched courts with their dilapidated houses, which formerly occupied the largest part of this area, were indeed veritable slums. Fever and infectious diseases of the deadliest character were seldom absent from them. The building of these new model dwellings is progressing rapidly. Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1875. THE PEABODY BUILDINGS, GREAT WILD STREET. The population of these buildings for the past year averaged 1,550. There were 72 births.—1st Quarter 21 2nd do. 20 3rd do. 16 4th do. 15 The birth-rate was as high as 46.4 per 1,000, and 13.9 above the rate for the whole district. There were 50 deaths.—1st Quarter 19 2nd do. 12 3rd do. 8 4th do. 11 The death-rate was equally high—32.2 per 1,000, and 8-l above the rate for the whole district. The zymotic death-rate was 7.0 per 1,000, against 2.7 for the whole district. The deaths from these infectious diseases were: Measles, 6; whooping-cough, 1; diphtheria, 2; fever, 2. ( 67 ) There were 4 deaths from croup and 1 from rheumatism. These diseases belong to the zymotic class, but are not reckoned of the same infectious character. Thirty-seven of the total deaths were children under 5 years of age: 19 died under 1 year, and 18 died between 1 and 5 years. In December last I reported this heavy death-rate to the Secretary of the Peabody Fund, and proposed to him a thorough inspection of the buildings, whereupon that gentleman expressed his compliance, and at once laid my communication before Sir Curtis Lamson, one of his trustees, who gave instructions to their architect and Messrs. Cubitt, the builders, to meet your Surveyor and myself in consultation at the buildings. At this meeting, which took place on the 21st of the month, drawings were produced showing the whole system of drainage of the premises, the construction of all w.c.'s, sinks, traps, and other sanitary arrangements, and the fullest explanation was given of their working. We were assured that the surface soil over the whole area covered by the new buildings had been carefully excavated and removed to a depth of several feet, and the area covered with concrete. A most careful and detailed inspection was made by us of the sanitary arrangements in two of the blocks of buildings, these two being types of the whole, and in the first of which the largest number of deaths had occurred during the year. We found everything in good condition, perfect cleanliness, an absence of smell, and no indication of anything in the sanitary appliances likely to produce either disease or death. After this most searching examination no sanitary evil was found to account for the heavy mortality, and which e 2 ( 68 ) was so much in excess of any other building belonging to the Trust, for it is stated in their annual report for 1883 that the death-rate for the whole of their buildings was but 18.6 per 1,000. But as the birth-rate in the Great Wild Street was very high, and 4-6 per 1,000 in excess of the whole of the Peabody Fund Buildings, it must to a certain extent be set-off against the heavy death-rate. The Outbreak of Scarlet Fever in St. Giles District in 1882 * The outbreak was not confined to this District, but affected part of St. Pancras, whereupon that Vestry reported the matter to the Local Government Board, and requested one of its Medical Inspectors to institute inquiries respecting it. The report of the Inspector, Mr. W. H. Power, has been published in the 12th Annual Report of the Local Government Board, which contains a remarkable and somewhat alarming hypothesis. The outbreak in question was supposed to be connected with milk obtained from a farm in Surrey: but no scarlet fever, nor any illness resembling it, had occurred at this farm, yet there was evidence that the milk was contaminated with the contagion of scarlet fever before it reached Charing Cross Railway Station, whither it was consigned by the farmer to the particular milkseller's place of business in this District. Mr. Power was thus led to start the theory that the milk was infected by the cow itself, and, as a corollary of this, that a cow may be able to transmit the poison of scarlet fever without herself * Vide account of the same in my Annual Report to the Boaril for the year 1881, page 64, ( 69 ) manifesting any signs of disease. This theory has been to some extent supported bv some experiments made by Dr. Klein, who has found that if a cow who lias recently calved be inoculated with the poison of' human scarlatina, she is affected by an ailment not accompanied by fever, or by any alteration in the quantity or visible qualities of the milk. Mr. Power sums up as follows: "Upon the whole, therefore, the conclusion became irresistible that this milk, delivered from the farm at two separate country stations, belonging to different railway companies, for consignment to separate London termini, and distributed in widely separated metropolitan districts, where it caused simultaneous outbursts of scarlatina and throat illness, had become infected at the farm whence it was derived. Accordingly, attention was given to means whereby it might have become infected at this farm. "Inquiry to this end necessarily traversed ground already gone over by the Medical Officer for St. Giles District, and it further took into account a variety of additional circumstances that might be hoped to assist in throwing a light on the subject. Into the various steps of this investigation I will not now enter, but will briefly state its outcome. I satisfied myself that it was practically out of the question that the milk at the farm had become infected in any of the commonly-believed ways that require a human subject as the source of infection; and I think it altogether unlikely that common-place fouling of dairy utensils by polluted water or the like, after such .fashion as has heretofore served to account for specific pollution of milk, can have here occurred. In the end I found myself, as on a former occasion, called upon to face the question whether or not actual cow conditions might have been ( 70 ) competent for the results observed; and, in considering this question, I came to see that a hypothesis of cowcausation would fit the facts that needed explanation as well as, or even better than, any other hypothesis. If only it could be believed that a single cow of this herd of 60 to 70 cows had been for a limited time capable of affording specifically infected milk, there was nothing in the routine of the farm dairy arrangements inconsistent with the milk of such single cow having been distributed among the churns consigned from the farm to London; and this in such a manner as to infect simultaneously the milk service of each London dairy supplied from the farm, and during a certain limited period a considerable proportion of that service. "At this stage of my thought on the subject I took the farmer into confidence, and got him to consider with me whether any new condition could have entered into his business about the second week in January, and if so, what the nature of it could have been. On reference to his books we found that one of his cows, due to calve on the 27tli December, had calved subsequently to, but within ten davs of, that date, and had come into milking: for business J / > purposes three or four days after calving. So far as we could judge, this calving constituted the sole new element introduced into the milk business of the farm for a considerable period before the milk became infective. Certainly, with this exception, no cow came freshly into milk between mid-November and the end of January. Respecting the health of the particular cow the farmer could say nothing, except that he had not heard of her having had any ailment; while the cowman, who had charge of this and of ten other cows, professed to be unable to remember the date and particulars of her calving; he even failed to ( 71 ) recollect the birth of the calf produced by her. Upon examination of this cow on the lltli February, I noted that she had here and there lost portions of her coat, and that her buttocks and posterior udder were fouled and stained bv excremental matter, and perhaps by vaginal discharge as well. In this respect she presented a rather strong contrast to most of the other cows. "Few physicians will be disposed to deny a relation between scarlatina and certain forms of febrile puerperal disease in women. The contagion of scarlatina introduced into the lying-in room has often, and with reason, been held responsible for 'puerperal fever.' It does not matter for my present purpose that there are other contagia having a similar power of mischief there. "Now, if it be true that there is one sort of relation between scarlatina and accidents of the puerperal state, another sort of relation becomes comparatively easy of belief; while there would seem nothing improbable in the further suggestion that all such relations would be qualified by the passage of a common contagion through the system of another animal. "If scarlatina in man have other animal source than human source, it may be that one such source is the cow that has recently calved, a cow either not at all ill (except for her parturition), or not so obviously ill as to prevent her milk being used for human consumption. Milk of a recently-delivered cow might become infective in more than one way. Either it might, as a secretion of the cow, contain infective matter that was circulating in the system of the cow, or else uterine and other discharges of the cow fouling her udder might by a careless milker be mixed with her milk in the act of milking." ( 72 ) Dwellings of the Poor. The difficult subject of housing the London poor has recently received considerable attention, both from the general public and the press. A Royal Commission is sitting, examining witnesses, and a Mansion House Sanitary Aid Committee is formed to make inquiries into the whole subject. Surprise has been generally expressed that so many of the poor tenement dwellings, are at the present time in such wretched insanitary condition. Having always lived in London, and had over 30 years' medical experience in visiting these places in poor districts, I do not share that feeling :—Two factors may cause it:— 1.— The recent wholesale demolition of small properties in the metropolis. For some years past numerous metropolitan improvements have been going on, notably—Southwark Street, Victoria Street, Westminster, the New Law Courts, the Somers' Town, the Farringdon Road, the Gray's Inn Road, the areas taken under the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Acts, the railway clearances, and others too numerous to mention. In most instances, the clearances have been effected largely at the expense of the dwellings of the poor. This demolition of thousands of closely-packed and thickly-inhabited houses, has undoubtedly been beneficial to the community, but the error has been committed in not having provided accommodation for the same class of people displaced. These poor folks, having been evicted from their homes, have had to find fresh lodgings under ( 73 ) the greatest difficulties, and at increased rentals. The scarcity of accommodation caused them to remove to houses of a somewhat better description, but having unfortunately brought their old habits with them, the new homes have been gradually reduced to the same level as the former ones. Hence a large number of London houses, which were formerly tenanted by small tradesmen and decent people, are now occupied by the poor, whose overcrowding and bad usage have brought the properties to a dilapidated condition and premature decay; and so added to the number of insanitary dwellings in the metropolis. 2.— The bad habits of the people. 1 will not include in my remarks the habits of the artizan class, who as a rule live respectably, and keep their rooms in decent order, but it is the poorest of the labouring classes, the waifs and strays, or the residuum of the population, that I would speak of, many of whom are so filthy and destructive in their habits that the sanitary officials are absolutely powerless to deal with them; for what is improved to-day becomes bad and dirty to-morrow. For this state of things a great deal of abuse has been heaped upon the landlord or middleman, but without being an apologist for that class, I must say that oftentimes he is not so blameable as is supposed, and at all times his position is by no means an enviable one, as it must be most disheartening for him to continually find his property destroyed. Covers to dust-bins, and cisterns burnt for firewood, sanitary fittings sold for a few pence, balusters pulled out, doors and windows broken in, and this destruction taking place as soon as the premises have been repaired. The vestries and district Boards have been charged with neglecting their duties in not carrying out the several Acts ( 14 ) of Parliament for the sanitary improvements of their districts. It is not for me to speak of other districts, but such is not my experience in St. Giles. Your Board has at all times given these matters the most careful consideration, and has readily supported its officers in the performance of their duties. The annual reports show that the various Acts of Parliament have been duly enforced and carried out for the sanitary improvement of the District. From 1875 to 1883, the sanitary inspectors made 95,295 visits and inspections. 12,573 orders were issued by direction of the Board for sanitary amendments of houses and premises; 7,770 houses were cleansed, repaired, and whitewashed; 194 houses were dealt with under the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868 (Torrens)—of these 150 were demolished, and 44 improved by structural alterations. Two Lakge Aheas (old fever dens), viz., the Great Wild Street, Drury Lane, and the Little Coram Street, Blooinsbury, have been dealt with under the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1875 (Cross). Another large area, Shelton Street, Drury Lane, consisting of 108 houses, is now under consideration by the Metropolitan Board of Works; and 14 houses in the Colonnade, in the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury, will shortly be reported on by your Surveyor under Torrens' Act. Writers and caricaturists have always been lavish in their condemnation of St. Giles. At the present time we are far from being perfect; but let us hope that the cant phrase, "Black as St. Giles," has disappeared, and that future ciitics will speak more kindly of the District. Sir Charles Dilke, Bart., the President of the Local Government Board, after inspecting the various districts, (75 ) was of opinion that the 35th Section of the Sanitary Act, 1866, and the Sanitarv Law Amendment Act, 1874, should be duly enforced throughout the metropolis. On receipt of his communication, your Board carefully drafted regulations for houses, or parts of houses, which are let in lodgings; but these regulations have not yet been confirmed by the Local Government Board. Sanitary Work. During the past year the Sanitary Inspectors made 10,045 visits, and served 1,221 orders for the sanitary amendments of houses and premises; 451 for cleansing, repairing, and limewhiting; and 83 for disinfecting houses and rooms after infectious diseases. The summary of this work will be found in Tables Nos. VI and VII. Appendix. The sanitary orders issued by your Board were in the majority of cases duly attended to. Five owners of property did not comply, and were summoned before the Magistrates; these were convicted, with costs, and orders were made upon them to carry out the necessary works. Overcrowding.—29 notices were served on owners to reduce overcrowding in their premises. It may be assumed that, in a district like St. Giles, these notices do not represent the amount of overcrowding going on amongst the poorer inhabitants. The sanitary staff do their best to prevent it; but the difficulty is in finding the cases. The only way to detect overcrowding would be to visit the tenement houses at night-time. Under the present law the Sanitary Inspector cannot enter a house after 6 p.m. (a police-constable can legally visit a common lodginghouse any time, day or night); but even if he could, grave ( 76 ) objections would be made to inspections when the occupants were in their beds. Underground Dwellings.—28 rooms illegally occupied and used as underground sleeping rooms were closed upon notices being served on the owners. Common Lodging Houses (vide Table XII, Appendix). —There are 67 common lodging-houses in the district, which accommodate 2,621 inmates. These houses are directly under the supervision of the police, and are kept in fair sanitary condition. The sergeant in charge at all times faithfully carries out my suggestions for their improvement. I will not discuss the question whether these 67 houses and their migratory lodgers are beneficial to the district, but I should say not. Slaughter-houses. On the 30th October the Middlesex Magistrates, at their Petty Sessions, held at the Holborn Town Hall, granted licenses for slaughter-houses to the following butchers:— Slaughter-houses. Licensees. No. 6, Drury Lane Mr. Elan. „ 23, Storr Street Mr. Belch. „ 11, Kenton Street Mr. Dunford. „ 11, Marchmont Street Mr. Vincett. „ 36, do. do. Mr. Batho. Cow-houses. On the same day renewed licenses were granted to the undermentioned cow-keepers:— (1) Mr. Rees Lewis, of No. 1, Coal Yard, to keep 10 cows, in a shed 28 ft. x 17 ft. x 15 ft. = 7,140 cubic feet. ( 77 ) (2) Messrs. Bonner and Capper, of 56, Great Coram Street, to keep 6 cows. in a shed 29 ft. x 16 ft. x 8 ft.= 3,712 cubic feet. (3) Messrs. Bonner and Capper, of 19, Tavistock Mews, to keep 11 cows, in a shed 24 ft. x 22 ft. x 10 ft. = 5,280 cubic feet. The several premises were inspected in October by the Sanitary Committee, and were found in a clean and wholesome condition. The three cow-sheds, which are licensed for the keeping of 27 cows, were found to contain 16 cows only at the time of inspection. Bakehouses. On the 25th August, 1883, an Act was passed, cited as "The Factory and Workshop Act, 1883," an Act to amend the law relating to certain factories and workshops. By this Act, the provisions respecting retail bakehouses are to be enforced by the Local Authority and not by an Inspector under the Factory and Workshop Act. This restores to Sanitary Authorities their former position as "Local Authority" (which they held prior to the repeal of the Bakehouse Regulation Act, 1863), so far as relates to the inspection, &c., of bakehouses. The following sections are important:— "15. (Regulations for new bakehouses.)—It shall not be lawful to let or suffer to be occupied as a bakehouse, or to occupy as a bakehouse, any room or place which was not so let or occupied before the 1st day of June, 1883, unless the following regulations are complied with:— "(1) No water-closet, earth-closet, privy, or ash-pit shall be within or communicate directly with the bakehouse. ( 78 ) "(II) Any cistern for supplying water to the bakehouse shall be separate and distinct from any cistern for supplying water to a water-closet. "(III) No drain or pipe for carrying off fæcal or sewage matter shall have an opening within the bakehouse. Any person who lets or suffers to be occupied, or who occupies any room or place as a bakehouse in contravention of this section, shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding five shillings for every day during which any room or place is so occupied after a conviction under this section. "16. (Penalty for bakehouse being unfit on sanitary grounds for use as a bakehouse.)—Where a Court of Summary Jurisdiction is satisfied on the prosecution of an Inspector or a Local Authority, that any room or place used as a bakehouse (whether the same was or was not so used before the passing of this Act) is in such a state as to be on sanitary grounds unfit for use or occupation as a bakehouse, the occupier of the bakehouse shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding forty shillings, and on a second or any subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding five pounds. "The Court of Summary Jurisdiction in addition to or instead of inflicting such fine may order means to be adopted by the occupier within the time named in the order, for the purpose of removing the ground of complaint. The Court may upon application enlarge the time so named, but if, after the expiration of the time as originally named or enlarged by subsequent order, the order is not complied with, the occupier shall be liable to a fine not exceeding one pound for every day that such non-compliance continues. (79 ) "17. (Enforcement of law as to retail bakehouses by Local Authorities.)—As respects every retail bakehouse, the provisions of this part of this Act, and of Sections 3, 33, 34, and 35 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878 (which relate to cleanliness, ventilation, overcrowding, and other sanitary conditions), shall be enforced by the Local Authority of the district, in which the retail bakehouse is situate, and not by an Inspector under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, and for the purpose of this section the Medical Officer of Health of the Local Authority shall have and exercise all such powers of entry, inspection, taking legal proceedings and otherwise, as an Inspector under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878." Rag and Bone Shops.—'No complaints have been made about these shops, and they are reported to have been kept in fairly good order, considering the nature of the business carried on in them. Provisions unfit for Human Food.—The meat sold in the market streets appears to have been of a better quality than that of the previous year, and no complaints have been received from the police and others as to any disease or objectionable food having been exposed for sale. The Inspectors, as usual, visited these streets on Saturday nights, and gave extra attention to them during the hot weather. Undoubtedly, the extra scavenging and watering now done on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings is most beneficial to Little Earl Street and its neighbourhood, and a further improvement would be made by paving Little Earl Street with asphalte,* as the roadway could be more *Your Surveyor, in October, 1882, was clearly of the same opinion, for in a report to your Board, on carriage-way pavings, he stated most emphatically that, whatever the expense might be, asphalte pavement should be laid in these streets. (80) easily and effectually cleansed from the market garbage and dirt left upon it. During the hot weather, several parcels of putrid fish and rotten fruit were destroyed at the Stone Yard, at their owners' requests. Animals so kept as to be a Nuisance.—Notices were served on owners to abate nuisances caused by the keeping of pigeons, rabbits, dogs, and pigs. In each case the notices were promptly obeyed. In conclusion, it is satisfactory to note that the sanitary condition of the District, comprising as it does so many of the dwellings of the poor, compares favourably with other metropolitan districts under similar conditions, and affords evidence of the efforts of your Board for its improvement.

(93) ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ANALYST APPOINTED UNDER THE SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. 17, Bloomsbury Square, London, W.C. July 1st, 1884. Gentlemen, During the year ending on the 31st of March last, I received from your Inspector, Mr. J. Hoyle, 239 samples for analysis, consisting of milk, condensed milk, butter, coffee, pepper, mustard, jams, pickles, flour, bread, green peas, confectionery, sausages, tinned meats, rum, gin, biscuits, vinegar, cheese, sulphate of quinine, quinine mixture, sweet spirits of nitre, precipitated sulphur, cream of tartar, iodide of potassium, powdered rhubarb, and citric acid. Of these samples, I found thirty to be adulterated; namely, twelve of milk, ten of butter, and eight of coffee. The proportion of adulterated articles, therefore, has amounted to 12.56 per cent. of the whole. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, T. REDWOOD.
