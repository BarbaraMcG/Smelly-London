Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Health of the Borough for 1964. This report has been compiled in the following five chapters, three with a statistical appendix, in which the figures relating to the functions of the Public Health Department have been collected together according to the relevant services. Chapter I VITAL STATISTICS, Page 8, Statistical Appendix A, Pages 9-15. II GENERAL HEALTH SERVICES, Pages 16-20. „ III INFECTIOUS DISEASES, Page 21, Statistical Appendix B, Pages 22-27. „ IV ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE, FOOD AND WATER, HOUSING, FACTORIES, ETC., Pages 28-37, Statistical Appendix C, Pages 38-52. V ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPARTMENT AND STAFF, Page 53. 5 As this document represents the final report on the health of Wembley, it might be advantageous to review some of the comments made by my predecessors in office. In the Annual Report of 1894 it was stated, in relation to one part of the Borough—"There are also complaints, which come to hand with almost regular periodicity, of nuisances in and around Alperton. I have over and over again reported on them to the old Board. A committee has inspected the whole district and, though from time to time the complainants admit that there has been some improvement, still complaints are made, sometimes as to nuisances from pig-keeping (which appears to be a considerable industry here), sometimes from gas-lime, and at others from the importation of 'hard' and 'softcore' and 'rough dust'." And the Report of the following year seemed to indicate that the difficulties of Alperton were not solved. "Alperton, as one of the Councillors recently observed, is NOT a Garden of Eden. It threatened at one time to become the dust-hole of the Metropolis, but I am in great hopes that better times are in store for it. It is, of course, absurd to suppose that it will be regarded as a model residential neighbourhood, but everything will be done to render the village quite healthy and habitable, and a constant watch kept on those (and they are many in number) who persistently, for their own private ends, make the air pestilential and the place intolerable by noxious importations. "There is another evil threatening us at Alperton and that is the manufacture of manure and oil from the REFUSE FISH FROM LONDON. How the proprietors came to build their factory almost in the heart of the village is inconceivable! "The odours from the BONE MANURE FACTORY on the canal side close by may possibly be mistaken for those from this fish factory so that you can easily imagine it requires a wise discriminating power to accurately differentiate the source of these various odours in Alperton." These were comments made in the early reports on this area and, indeed, examination of more recent reports indicates that although conditions have changed, complaints still emanate from residents and often indeed are justified. The Department continues to do 6 thing possible to abate any source of discomfort and there need be no anxiety about the services which are to be handed on to the new Borough as these have developed over the years in relation to the circumstances of Wembley and to meet the needs of the area and are perfectly suited to the requirements. 7 CHAPTER I. VITAL STATISTICS 1. The population of the Borough in mid-1964 was estimated by the Registrar-General to be 123,780. The census of April, 1961, reveals a figure of 124,892. 2. In 1964 there were recorded 1,885 live births, giving a crude birth rate of 15.2 per thousand estimated population. The Registrar General has provided boroughs with a comparability factor for this calculation which takes into account the relative proportion of women of child bearing age in the total community. When this factor of 1.05 is applied the standardised birth rate becomes 16.0, a more realistic figure, the origin of which, however, must be remembered when comparing it with past years. 3. The infantile mortality rate of 13.26 comparies very favourably with the national rate of 20 per thousand and this is often used as a pointer to the adequacy of the services provided. This figure would have seemed quite unattainable a few years ago and indicates the advances in obstretrics and paediatrics which have become available in the district in recent years. 4. The number of deaths totalled 1,224, giving a crude death rate of 9.89 per thousand. The comparability factor when applied produces a standardised death rate of 10.88, again well below the national rate. 5. Cancer of the lung and bronchus continues to be by far the commonest site of fatal malignant disease. During the year there was a total of 81 deaths (68 male and 13 female) as compared with deaths from the same cause during the five preceding years:— Male. Female.

GENERAL HEALTH SERVICES. 1. HOSPITALS. The whole of Wembley lies within the area of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board but hospitals accepting the sick are administered by two Hospital Management Committees, the Central Middlesex Group Hospital Management Committee and the Hendon Group Hospital Management Committee, the two major general hospitals being the Central Middlesex Hospital and the Edgware General Hospital. The Wembley Hospital is administered by the Mount Vernon Group, and the Kingsbury Maternity Hospital under the control of the Governors of Charing Cross. Infectious diseases are normally accepted at the Neasden Hospital or, in case of necessity, at the West Hendon Hospital. Cases of mental subnormality are catered for at Leavesden Hospital. Arrangements are made for the admission of tuberculous patients to a variety of hospitals through the three Chest Clinics serving the area. A list of hospitals is included:— Central Middlesex Hospital, Acton Lane, N.W.10. (ELGar 5733.) Edgware General Hospital, Edgware, Middlesex. (EDGware 2381.) Wembley Hospital, Fairview Avenue, Wembley, Middlesex. (WEMbley 3136.) Kingsbury Maternity Hospital, Honeypot Lane, Kingsbury, N.W.9. (COLindale 6309.) Neasden Hospital, Brentfield Road, Neasden, N.W.10. (WILlesden 2251.) West Hendon Hospital, Goldsmith Avenue, Hendon, N.W.9.

Edgware Chest Clinic, Edgware General Hospital, Edgware, Middlesex. (EDGware 3406.) The planning of a new hospital at Northwick Park is still under discussion between the Ministry and the Regional Hospital Board. 2. AMBULANCE SERVICE. A service of ambulances and sitting case cars is maintained by the Middlesex County Council as Local Health Authority at:— No. 4 Depot. (DRYden 0251) The accident service is obtained by dialling 999. The authority of a medical practitioner is required for service to be given, except in emergency and accident cases. 3. HEALTH SERVICES. Health Services under Part III of the National Health Service Act, 1946, are provided by the County Council and relevant details in so far as they apply to the Borough are included below:— County Medical Officer: Guy Wigley, M.R.C.S., D.P.H. 3, 5 & 7, Old Queen Street, S.W.1.

NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACTS — COMPULSORY REMOVAL. Power is given to the Medical Officer of Health to make application to a Magistrate, if necessary ex parte, for the compulsory removal of any person who is suffering from a grave or chronic disease and is not obtaining or is not able to give to himself the care and attention necessary to his condition. During the very severe weather of the first months of this year conditions deteriorated in the homes of many elderly persons and it was necessary to invoke the use of this legislation for two compulsory removals—one man and one woman. This action is described in the Annual Report, as the compulsory removal of an individual from his home is undertaken only in dire emergency and calls for recognition of the fact that the action is, although directed to the welfare of the person involved, none the less arbitrary and oppressive. 19 5. VERMINOUS CONDITIONS. No cases of infestation were discovered. The response of the mothers to the advice given through the School Health Services is most gratifying. 6. MORTUARY. The Mortuary, situated at the rear of the Town Hall, received 187 bodies during the year. Reciprocal arrangements have been made with Harrow to cover absences of attendants due to holidays, sickness, etc. 7. OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE. In October, 1962, a member of the Department was appointed Honorary Secretary to the Borough of Wembley Old People's Welfare Committee. This has enabled the various services which are the responsibility of the Borough Council and Middlesex County Council to be co-ordinated with those given by the voluntary organisations which help the elderly. Cases brought to the notice of the Committee and found to require the specialist advice of a Health Inspector, Health Visitor or the Area Welfare Officer are referred to the appropriate office. Similarly these officers approach the Honorary Secretary if a voluntary service is required, e.g., a visitor or help with the garden. The Housing Department also work closely with the Honorary Secretary regarding voluntary services for their elderly residents. There are 26 clubs in the Borough run by various organisations, and from time to time a bulletin is issued keeping them informed of help needed and any new facilities which are available. Welfare foods consisting of Complan, Horlicks, Ovaltine, Bovril, Marmite, and also Tea, are distributed to Clubs and the Guild of Social Service for sale at cost price, and parcels of these were distributed to the needy at Christmas. Holidays at Cliftonville and Southsea, for the elderly, were organised. A booklet setting out the services available to the elderly is distributed throughout the Borough. 20 CHAPTER III. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 1. The year was notable for the absence of any outbreak of major infection and particularly for the absence of poliomyelitis from the Borough during the whole period. 2. INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATES OF IMMUNISATION. The Department continues to authenticate the International Certificates of Vaccination for travellers who have received inoculations from Wembley practitioners. During the year 1,992 certificates received attention in the Department. INVESTIGATION—TYPHOID FEVER 3. The first notice from the Ministry of Health identifying the canning stations at which the suspect corned beef was packed, was received on 3rd June. By the end of the following day the Public Health Inspectors had contacted all the warehouses, butchers, grocers canteens and restaurants in the Borough (385) where it was believed that cans might be in stock. The proprietors or managers were requested to check their stocks of 6-lb. cans and to notify the Department if any bearing the significant embossment were found. Information was received of the whereabouts of 1,313 cans so marked, and following the second circular from the Ministry, these were checked by the Inspectors for the date codings covering the period at risk. Arrangements were then made for those not eliminated to be returned to the suppliers in accordance with the Ministry's recommendations. In addition, the holders of these cans were asked to provide the Department with information as to the destination of the cans and evidence of their shipment (e.g. a receipt) in order that the local authority in which the suppliers' premises were situated, could be notified of the transfer. 21 STATISTICAL APPENDIX B.

ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE, FOOD AND WATER, HOUSING, FACTORIES, ETC. 1. HAWKERS AND STREET TRADING. When major events occur at the Stadium a substantial number of hawkers and street traders invariably attempt to pursue their calling in the neighbourhood of the Stadium, and for many years the Department has endeavoured to exercise control over those concerned with the vending of foodstuffs. With this object, special visits were paid to the neighbourhood of the Stadium when eight important events took place, and inspections made of eighty-seven vehicles or stalls. Twenty-six making a first appearance were "warned off" for failure to register under the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, or lapses in hygiene, and did not return during the season. Unregistered traders who returned after warnings, and persistent offenders against the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960, six in number, were prosecuted and fined a total of £140 10s .0d. with £26 5s. Od. costs, in one case it being necessary for the police to apprehend the defendant in order to ensure his appearance. An interesting commentary on the effect of the penalities imposed by the courts was the re-appearance, on one occasion only, of a gentleman who had declared his intention, only the previous year, of retiring from the street-trading business following a sixth conviction at a cost to him of some £86 0s. 0d. This time no fault was found in the hygiene of his van, and he was charged only with failing to register. Of course, hawkers are not found only in the neighbourhood of the Stadium. Several have established stores and routes in the Borough, are duly registered and conduct their businesses perfectly satisfactorily. During the year, however, two applications for new registration were refused on the grounds that the storage accommodation in each instance fell short of hygienic requirements. 28 2. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 : Section 3 : New Furnaces. A dual obligation is imposed upon any person who installs a new furnace in industrial premises or a new furnace of an output greater than 55,000 British Thermal Units per hour in domestic premises, (a) to install only such a furnace which is, so far as practicable, capable of being operated continuously without emitting smoke when burning fuel of the type for which it was designed, and (b) to notify the local authority of his intention to install the furnace. During the year the Health Department became aware, by notification or otherwise, of the installation of furnaces, which appear to meet the requirements of the section, in existing buildings as follows:— Oil-fired. Gas-fired Solid smokeless fuel. Industrial premises 2 — — Commercial premises 7 3 — Dwellings 75 106 28 The use of one unsatisfactory industrial incinerator was discontinued, and two of an acceptable type installed. Furnaces proposed in new buildings were as follows:— Oil-fired. Gas-fired Solid smokeless fuel. Industrial premises 3 — — Commercial premises 4 — — 29 Section 10 : New Industrial Chimneys. When the deposited plans for the erection or extension of a building other than a dwelling, shop or office, include the provision of a chimney, the local authority must be satisfied that the height of the chimney will be sufficient to disperse adequately any smoke, grit, dust or gases emitted from it. During the year agreement was reached in respect of suitable heights for nine new chimneys. Section 11 : Smoke Control Areas. Wembley No. 9 (Lyon Park) Smoke Control Order, 1963. Wembley No. 10 (St. Andrew's) Smoke Control Order, 1964. Wembley No. 11 (Barham) Smoke Control Order, 1964. In the year under review the first Order came into operation and the second and third Orders were confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government. A further two thousand four hundred buildings of all kinds occupying an area of two hundred and forty-three acres thereby became subject to control. It is thought that as a result some three thousand tons of raw coal will no longer be inefficiendy burnt in open domestic fireplaces each year and some seventy-five tons less smoke will be emitted at the comparatively low level of house chimneys. In meeting claims for grant received or anticipated in respect of works for improvement to the heating arrangements at 1,038 houses in the area, the net cost to the Council is expected to be some £8,520 (including £3,700 spent on Council-owned property). Area No. 9 includes a substantial number (one hundred and forty-seven) of factories, offices and other non-residential buildings, in which there are one hunderd and forty space heating or process furnaces consuming, per annum, an estimated nine hundred and seventy tons of coal, ten tons of wood-waste, one thousand six hundred tons of coke and four thousand four hundred tons of fuel oil. The exemptions allowed for the four premises burning coal and wood-waste impose conditions calculated to reduce the emission of smoke to an absolute minimum. 30 Wembley Smoke Control Orders Nos. 1—8, 1960-1962. The areas covered by these Orders have been under surveillance during the year and no contraventions calling for formal action have been observed. Section 25 : Measurement of atmospheric pollution. Thanks to the willing co-operation of the headmasters and staff of the three schools concerned and of the management and staff of the research laboratory, daily recording of the smoke and sulphur dioxide content of the air, has remained in progress throughout the year at the four measuring stations set up by the Department at:— Kingsbury County Grammar School.

(1) With the co-operation of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, plans deposited for planning consent or approval under the building byelaws, which show that car parking spaces are to be provided in a building, are examined in this Department. A licence is necessary when there is likely to be an aggregate of more than sixty gallons of petroleum-spirit kept in the fuel tanks of motor vehicles, and in granting a licence the Council imposes the conditions recommended by the Home Office. Where less than sixty gallons is to be kept in this manner the premises must comply with conditions set out in the Petroleum-Spirit (Motor Vehicles, etc.) Regulations, 1929. 32 During the year there were examined two proposals which came within the scope of the Regulations and four to which licensing conditions were applicable. (2) Ullage tests on 65 underground petrol tanks over twenty years old, and totalling 52,000 gallons capacity, were made, and 6 tanks were tested with nitrogen under pressure. As a result, one tank was found to have a leaking manhole gasket which was renewed, and seven leaking pipe-lines renewed. The use of 5 tanks, 2,500 gallons capacity, was discontinued for various reasons, and these were filled with water pending possible re-use or removal. (3) Fifteen new tanks of a total capacity of 60,000 gallons were installed and tested to the satisfaction of the Inspectors, and the number of new pumps of approved pattern installed was 26. (4) Number of premises licensed to store petroleum- spirit or mixtures 145 Aggregate amount of petroleum-spirit and mixtures stored under licence (in gallons) 411,561 Number of visits of inspection made to premises 367 4. HOUSES IN MULTIPLE OCCUPATION. The situation in respect of the multiple occupation of houses in Wembley has by no means reached a point at which control should give rise to serious difficulty. Details of all cases of which the Department becomes aware are firstly referred to the Town Planning Section of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department, in order that consideration may be given to the grant of planning permission, if necessary. Where permission is granted, or the user of the premises is sufficiently long established not to require permission, action is recommended under the Housing Act, 1961, sections 15 and/or 19 to secure the provision of appropriate amenities for the occupiers in accordance with the following standards adopted by the Council in May, 1962. 33 At the end of the year the position was as follows :— Cases outstanding from 1963 5 New cases investigated in 1964 4 Brought up to Council's standard 1 Ceased to be so occupied 3 Pending planning permission or enforcement action at the end of the year 5 5. COURT PROCEEDINGS. Apart from the cases taken against food hawkers already mentioned, it was found necessary to proceed in the magistrates' courts in another nine instances. Three cases concerned smoking in places where there was open food and one for various other contraventions of the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960. In all, fines of £85 0s. 0d. were imposed and costs of £11 11s. 0d. awarded. There was a considerable increase in the number of complaints received regarding foreign matter in foodstuffs, no fewer than fiftythree (although not all were justified) being considered by the Health Committee during the year varying from mould in an apple strudel to a spider in a bottle of lemonade, the most common being insufficiently cleansed milk bottles and discoloured bread. In a large proportion of cases, the Committee would have authorised the institution of proceedings but for the unwillingness of the complainants to give evidence. On three occasions, prosecutions were dropped when the complainants withdrew their original offer to appear. Four cases only reached the magistrates' courts resulting in fines totalling £60 0s. 0d. and costs awarded amounting to £23 2s. 0d. Two cases had not been heard by the end of the year. For selling meat unfit for human consumption a butcher was fined £20 0s. Od. with £5 5s. 0d. costs. 34 6. PUBLIC SWIMMING BATHS. Two open-air public swimming baths are provided in the area and serve the general public during the summer period, usually from May to September. The Vale Farm Pool is 55 yards long and 25 yards wide with a maximum depth of 9 feet and has a capacity of 400,000 gallons of water which is obtained from the Colne Valley water supply. The Pool is constructed of mass concrete and lined with glazed bricks. The water is filtered through Candy Pressure Filters and has a complete change every 4½ hours, the circulation being effected by 20 h.p. pump with a stand-by 15 h.p. pump. "Breakpoint" chlorination is effected and an average consumption of approximately 3 lbs. per hour of chlorine. The water is then neutralised by the addition of soda which gives an approximate pH factor of 7.5 which indicates slight alkalinity. The bathing load is approximately 1,500 and the basket room system of changing is in operation with cubicles surrounding the Pool. A Cafe is provided for refreshments and the catering let out to a Caterer on an annual basis. The Kingsbury Pool is situated in Roe Green Park in the Kingsbury Road and has a length of 55 yards and a width of 25 yards with a maximum depth of 10 feet. The capacity is 464,000 gallons but in this case there is a foot trough surrounding the Pool and also a Children's paddling pool. The water is supplied by the Colne Valley Water Company and is circulated through Permutit Pressure Filters and pumped by means of two 15 h.p. pumps and a complete change of water is effected every five hours. Chlorination is again on the "breakpoint" system and the same dosage and neutralisation arrangements. The Pool at Kingsbury is constructed of reinforced concrete and again is lined with glazed bricks. The capacity of this Pool for bathing is approximately 2,000, but there is a greater spectator area here than at Vale Farm. The basket room system is again in operation but in this case the changing accommodation cubicles are under the terraced seating. A Cafe is also provided at this Pool and catering is carried out by outside Caterers. 35 Samples of the water taken from the Pools and subjected to bacteriological examination, revealed the absence of B. Coli in all samples and proved the quality of the water to be beyond reproach. 7. SEWERAGE. The growth of the population in Wembley and the increase in domestic and other premises, was very considerable during the years 1930/1960, and the intervention of a period when few works could be undertaken on account of wartime conditions resulted in the Borough being behind-hand in the provision of adequate drainage, both for the surface water and for soil sewage. The Council were very conscious of this difficulty and an extensive programme of sewerage construction received their approval. Details of the relief schemes are included. Estimated Name. Type. Expenditure. Remarks. 1. Hay Lane. Surface Water. £10,000 Completed 1964. 2. East Lane. Soil and Surface £45,000 Completed 1964. Water 3. London Road/ Soil and Surface £150,000 Commenced 1964.

The Rodent Control Service which is confined to dealing with infestations by rats and mice has continued to operate during the year under review. A staff of three " Ministry trained" assistants has performed the necessary work. No charge is made to householders in respect of treatment at private dwelling houses but in all other cases a charge is made on a time and materials basis. 754 dwelling houses and 160 business premises were satisfactorily treated by the Council. 9. PUBLIC CLEANSING. The Cleansing Maintenance and Transport Engineer has kindly supplied the following information :— Refuse Collection. House and Trade refuse is collected weekly, with the exception that refuse from certain blocks of flats is collected twice weekly. The amount of refuse collected during the year was 32,046 tons. The separate collection of waste paper from business premises has been maintained. The amount collected from this source during the year was 777 tons. Bulk collection of refuse has been introduced at certain premises. Refuse Disposal. Refuse is disposed of by a Separation and Incineration Plant. During the year 33,332 tons was handled. Salvage materials amounting to 3,313 tons were sold for £18,161. Street Cleansing. Street sweeping is carried out by the use of pedestrian controlled electric trucks, together with in some cases individual street orderly trucks. Particular attention is given to shopping areas. Public Conveniences. Free washing facilities were available at the two staffed Conveniences in the Borough. 37 STATISTICAL APPENDIX C.

During the year your Medical Officers of the Department undertook the medical examinations of 59 actual or prospective staff and provided a number of special reports to the various Committees of the Council on matters of medical importance. This service secures a medically sound personnel for all the activities of the Council and enables special consideration to be given to any unusual incidence of sickness, thereby saving expenditure and maintaining a standard of efficiency difficult in the absence of such a service. This will be the final occasion when a Medical Officer of Health, Wembley, can express his sincere appreciation and thanks to the members of the staff of the Health Department who have loyally supported the traditions of Local Government and Social Medicine in their work for the Borough. It would be difficult to find a more competent and enthusiastic staff meriting the thanks of myself and the Committee, without any reservation. One would not like to single out any individual but in passing it is incumbent upon me to recall that Dr. Halperin has served as Deputy Medical Officer of Health of the Borough for 14 years and on her retirement during November left the Department with the very best wishes of her colleagues for a long and happy retirement. The Reorganisation of Local Government in London has required a great deal of research by many senior members of the Department and a considerable addition to their endeavours, particularly outside office hours. The result of the reorganisation awaits revelation in the future but some members of the staff have been favoured and others prejudiced. Despite the uncertainty of the last year I can say, without reservation, that the loyalty of all members of the Department to myself and to the Council has been unfailing. 53 The last comment which I am able to make as Medical Officer of Health is to thank the Chairman of the Health Committee, members of the Health Committee, and all other members of the Council, for the interest they have taken in the work of the Department and the support and direction they have given in our endeavours towards the health of Wembley. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen. Your obedient servant, E. GRUNDY, Medical Officer of Health 54 Hendon Printing Works Limited 66, East Road, Burnt Oak Edgware, Middlesex Telephone: EDG. 6181 JR2/68
