The vital statistics are excellent. The Infantile Mortality rate reached a new low level at 16.6 per 1.000 live births, a figure which would have been considered impossible of attainment 30 years ago. There was a slight drop in the birth rate and in the general death rate. Although there was an increase in certain of the common infectious diseases such as Measles and Whooping Cough, there was not a single death from any of them. There were only three cases of Poliomyelitis. The Borough has now been entirely free from Diphtheria for more than five years, and if parents continue to do their duty by having their children immunised there is no reason why the disease should ever return. There was a slight but very welcome fall in both notifications of and deaths from tuberculosis. The housing problem remains much the same as it has been during the post-war years, and there is nothing to add to what I have said in recent reports. A lot of work has been done in an attempt to instil into those who handle our food a greater sense of the importance of cleanliness. Many of the food traders have been most co-operative but still more have remained indifferent. It is realised that a long and sustained effort will be necessary to arouse the interest of the latter group. The welfare of the aged is a growing problem. There are many old people in the Borough who are unable to look after themselves and are not being properly cared for. When they 3 require hospital treatment it is often very difficult to get them admitted. When they are willing to go to a "home" there is always a long waiting list. When they refuse to go away, the Borough Council, on the receipt of a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health, may apply to a court of summary jurisdiction for an order for their removal to a suitable institution for a period not exceeding three months. It is no easy matter to decide when one is justified in issuing a certificate as these unfortunate people are mostly frail creatures who want nothing more than to be allowed to end their days in what they are pleased to call their own homes. They have to be removed or rather uprooted by force and the end usually comes very soon afterwards. It gives me much pleasure to acknowledge the excellent work of all members of the staff and I would particularly mention the skill and enthusiasm of all the Sanitary Inspectors in the campaign for cleaner food. I am. Your obedient Servant, A. A. TURNER, Medical Officer of. Health. 4 STATISTICS Area (in acres) 3,477 Population, 1950 (Registrar-General's Estimate) 70,720 Number of Inhabited Houses (1950) 19,494 Rateable Value (1950) £913,142 Sum represented by a Penny Rate £3,753 Total Live Births 962 Birth Rate per 1,000 home population 13.6 Birth Rate per 1,000 population (England and Wales) 15.8 Total Stillbirths 21 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 (live and still) births 21.4 Total Deaths 819 Death Rate per 1,000 home population 11.6 Death Rate per 1,000 population (England and Wales) 11.6 Infant Deaths 16 Infant Mortality Rate 16.6 Infant Mortality Rate (England and Wales) 29.8 Maternal Deaths 2 Maternal Mortality Rate 2.03 Maternal Mortality Rate (England and Wales) 0.86 Live Births: Moles Females Total Legitimate 477 453 930 Illegitimate 16 16 32 493 469 962 Birth rate 13.6 per 1,000 estimated home population.

Births There were 962 registered live births in 1950, as compared with 981 in the previous year while the birth rate was 13.6 as compared with 13.9. The rate for England and Wales was 15.8. Stillbirths There were 21 stillbirths in 1950 giving a rate of 0.30 per 1,000 of the home population. The rate for England and Wales was 0.37. Infantile Mortality There were only 16 deaths of infants under one year of age giving an infantile mortality rate of 16.6 per 1,000 live births which is a new low record for the Borough. The corresponding rate for England and Wales was 29.8. Maternal Mortality Two mothers died in 1950 giving a maternal mortality rate of 2.03 per 1,000 births. The rate for England and Wales was 0.86. Deaths There were 819 deaths in 1950, 15 less than in 1949. There were 18 less deaths from cancer than in 1949. There were 46 more deaths of persons of 65 years of age and over than in 1949. 6 BIRTH AND DEATH RATES SINCE 1925 The crude death rate was 11.6 and the standardised death rate was 10.79. The rate for England and Wales was 11.6. Each district is allotted a comparability figure by the Registrar General which varies according to the age and sex constitution of the population as compared with those of England and Wales as a whole. The average age of the population of Finchley is considerably higher than that of the Country as a whole and as there are inevitably more deaths per 1,000 in an older population than in a younger one Finchley is allotted a comparability figure of 0.93 by which the crude death rate is multiplied in order to obtain the standardised death rate. The difference in the sex constitution of the population of Finchley from that of England and Wales is too slight to have any appreciable effect on the death rate. Mortuary One hundred and nineteen bodies were received in the Mortuary, and 26 of these were from Friern Barnet. Post-mortem examinations were carried out in all cases except one. 9 INFANTILE MORTALITY DURING THE YEAR 1950 Deaths from stated causes at various ages under one year of age CAUSE OF DEATH Under 1 week 1-2 weeks 2-5 weeks 3-4 weeks Total under 4 weeks 4 weeks and under 3 months 3-6 months 6-9 months 9-12 months TOTAL All Certified 9 1 1 1 12 1 2 1 - 16 Causes Uncertified - - - - - - - - - - Smallpox - - - - - - - - - - Chicken Pox - - - - - - - - - - Measles - - - - - - - - - - Scarlet Fever - - - - - - - - - - Whooping Cough - - - - - - - - - - Diphtheria & Croup - - - - - - - - - - Erysipelas - - - - - - - - - - Tuberculous Meningitis - - - - - - - - - - Meningitis (not Tuberculous) - - - - - - - - - - Convulsions - - - - - - - - - - Laryngitis - - - - - - - - - - Bronchitis - - - - - - - - - - Pneumonia (all forms) - - - 1 1 - 1 - - 2 Diarrhœa - - - - - - - - - - Enteritis - - - - - - - - - - Gastritis - - - - - - - - - - Syphilis - - - - - - - - - - Rickets - - - - - - - - - - Suffocation, - - - - - - - - - - Overlying - - - - - - - - - - Injury at Birth - - - - - - - - - - Atelectasis 1 - - - 1 - - - - 1 Congenital Malformations 4 - - - 4 - 1 - - 5 Premature Birth 2 - - - 2 1 - - - 3 Atrophy, Debility and Marasmus - - - - - - - - - - Other Causes 2 1 1 - 4 - - 1 - 5 TOTALS 9 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 - 16 10 INFANT DEATH AND NEO-NATAL DEATH RATES SINCE 1925 .

They introduced nomenclature consistent with the international standard classification of diseases, and included the terms, acute poliomyelitis (paralytic and non-paralytic), acute encephalitis (infective and post-infectious) and meningococcal; infection. The term Cerebro Spinal Fever is no longer in use. Diphtheria There has not been a case of Diphtheria in the Borough since August, 1946, a fact which affords ample evidence that this disease can be banished from the community by adequate immunisation* but parents should realise that they can prevent its return only by taking every advantage of the facilities provided for the protection of their children. During 1950, 744 children were immunised. Of these, 351 were immunised by private practitioners and 393 at sessions arranged by the Area Medical Officer. 16 The number of children immunised during the previous 3 years was as follows:- 1947 996 1948 1,163 1949 982 Scarlet Fever There were 132 cases of Scarlet Fever, eight more than in the previous year. The known cases were mild in character and there is little doubt that in a number of others the illness was so slight as to escape detection altogether. There were no deaths. Poliomyelitis There were 3 cases of poliomyelitis and all were mild in character. Measles There were 730 cases of measles—nearly twice the number notified in 1949, and there were no fatal cases. Whooping Cough There were 361 cases notified in 1950, four times as many as in 1949. None of the cases was fatal. Pneumonia Forty-eight cases were notified in 1950 and there were 43 deaths, 34 of which were persons of 65 years of age and over. Miscellaneous The following cases were also notified:- Dysentery 5 Erysipelas 6 Food poisoning 3 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 1 Paratyphoid B 1 Puerperal Pyrexia 15 19 Bacteriological Work The following table shows the number and nature of the specimens examined at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, during 1950. Positive Negative Throat/Nose Swabs: Diphtheria Bacilli - 386 Hemolytic Streptococci 135 Vincent's Angina 7 Fæes: Sonne Dysentery 2 64 Salmonella 9 Protozoa - Sputum: T.B. Smear 7 63 Other Organisms 4 Whooping Cough: Cough Plate 16 Post-nasal Swab - 164 529 Tuberculosis Fifty-eight cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were notified in 1950 as compared with 78 in 1949, and 9 non-pulmonary as compared with 6 in the previous year. Deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis decreased from 18 in 1949 to 14 in 1950 and the deaths from non-pulmonary decreased from 5 in 1949 to 2 in 1950. It is gratifying to note the downward trend in both notifications and deaths. 20 TUBERCULOSIS (ALL FORMS) The following table shows the number of notifications and the number of deaths during the past 10 years: Year New Cases Deaths Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M F M F M F M F 1941 34 38 5 7 18 15 7 1 1942 40 39 4 3 14 19 1 1 1943 41 39 7 5 14 11 3 5 1944 48 30 8 8 14 9 3 2 1945 49 41 8 1 17 9 5 1 1946 43 26 2 8 14 9 1 2 1947 54 36 1 4 18 9 2 - 1948 37 26 4 5 5 7 3 2 1949 41 37 2 4 10 8 1 4 1950 37 21 2 7 9 5 2 ~ MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS Candidates for permanent appointment to the Council's service are required to pass a medical examination on appointment. This also applies to the Manual Staff for admission to the Sickness Pay Scheme of the National Joint Industrial Council for Local Authorities' Non-Trading Services. During the year the following examinations were carried out: Administrative, Technical and Clerical Staff 18 Sickness Pay Scheme 71 Total 89 23 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA The following are particulars of the work dealt with by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year 1950: Housing Statistics 1. Inspection of Dwelling-houses: (1) (a) Total number of dwelling-houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health or Housing Acts) 1,375 (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose 5,806 (2) (a) Number of dwelling-houses (included under sub-head (1) above) which were inspected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations, 1925 - (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose - (3) Number of dwelling-houses found to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation 3 (4) Number of dwelling-houses (exclusive of those referred to under the preceding sub-head) found not to be in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation 794 2. Remedy of defects during the year without service of formal notices: Number of defective dwelling-houses rendered fit in consequence of informal action by the Local Authority or their officers 590 3. Action under Statutory Powers during the year: A. Proceedings under Sections 9, 10 and 16 of the Housing Act, 1936: (1) Number of dwelling-houses in respect of which notices were served requiring repairs 11 (2) Number of dwelling-houses which were rendered fit after service of formal notices: (a) By owners 7 24 (b) By Local Authority in default of owners 1 B. Proceedings under Public Health Acts: (1) Number of dwelling-houses in respect of which notices were served requiring defects to be remedied 14 (2) Number rendered fit: (a) By owners 14 (b) By Local Authority in default of owners - C. Proceedings under Sections li and 13 of the Housing Act, 1936: (1) Number of dwellng-houses in respect of which Demolition Orders were made 2 (2) Number of dwelling-houses demolished in pursuance of Demolition Orders - Houses Unfit for Human Habitation 1116 High Road, N.20 1188 High Road, N.20 Hut rear of 365 High Road, N.2 The above premises were found to be unfit and incapable of repair at reasonable cost and in the case of 1116 High Road, N.20, a demolition notice was served upon the owner. The house was vacated and the tenants rehoused by the Council. With regard to the Hut rear of 365 High Road, N.2, which was occupied by a family who had moved from the North, the owner, upon whom a demolition order had been served, obtained possession of the hut and the tenants were rehoused in Half-Way House accommodation by the Ministry. 54 Alexandra Grove, N.12 The basement flat, upon which a closing order had been made, was vacated, the tenants being rehoused by the Council. The owner submitted an undertaking to carry out works to make the flat habitable, and the work was in progress at the end of the year. 25 1050-1056 High Road, N.20 These houses which were purchased by the Council were demolished and the site cleared. Inspections The total number of inspections made during the year was 15,908. At 827 of the houses and other premises visited, defects or nuisances to the number of 3,784 were discovered, and at the end of the year 3,031, including a number outstanding at the end of 1949, had been remedied or abated. The work in connection with 146 was in hand and 2,322 were outstanding. In order to ascertain that the sanitary defects were being properly remedied 1,947 visits were paid to the respective premises while the work was in progress. Once again I must draw attention to the serious position with regard to housing repairs arising from the rising costs of labour and materials, and the static rents of controlled dwellings. The total number of inspections made in regard to each section of work is recorded below, together with a summary of the sanitary improvements carried out: Inspections under Housing Acts 33 Special Inspections 3,399 Reinspections 2,864 Inspections of Works in Progress 1,947 Inspections of Factories, Workshops and Workplaces (including Bakehouses and Restaurant Kitchens) 521 Visits to Slaughterhouses 6 Inspections of Cowsheds, Dairies and Milkshops 20 Inspections of Ice Cream Premises 94 Inspections of Meat, Fish and other Food Shops 775 Inspections of Shops (Shops Acts) 119 Visits re Infectious Disease and Vermin 770 Visits re Rodent Control 4,021 Visits re Housing Act, 1936 272 Visits re Building Licences 13 Visits re Hawkers 62 Visits to Hairdressers' Premises 9 26 Visits to Houses let in lodgings 17 Miscellaneous 966 15,908 Summary of Sanitary Improvements carried out Drainage Number of houses and premises re-drained 7 Repairs or amendments to existing drains 60 Drains or gullies unstopped or cleansed 286 Length in yards of stoneware drains laid 886 Manholes provided 45 Manholes repaired 11 Manhole covers provided 40 Intercepting traps fixed 7 Fresh air inlets provided or repaired 8 New gully traps fixed 106 Gully curbs provided or repaired 5 New soil pipes and ventilating shafts fixed 15 Soil pipes and ventilating shafts repaired 12 Water tests applied 309 Smoke tests applied 29 Air tests applied 15 Water Closets and Sanitary Fittings New W.C.

The necessary searches were made and the required information furnished. Disinfection and Disinfestation Number of rooms disinfected after infectious disease 202 Number of articles disinfected 1,779 Number of verminous premises dealt with 50 Verminous rooms disinfested 112 Seven hundred and seventy visits were made by the inspectors and disinfectors in connection with cases of infectious disease and verminous premises and the necessary investigations were made in order to obtain the detailed information required. There was an increase in the number of premises infested with bugs, 30 cases having been dealt with, compared with 24 in 1949. The following is a summary of disinfestation work carried out during the year. Premises Bugs 30 Fleas 2 Cockroaches 10 Ants 10 Wasps 39 Bees 1 Miscellaneous 8 1 he number or verminous rooms which were dealt with was 112 compared with 98 in 1949. Houses Let in Lodgings During the year one addition was made to the Register of Houses let in lodgings. 29 The number of registered premises in the Borough is now 77 Common Lodging Houses There are no common lodging houses in the Borough. Sanitary Conveniences There are 24 conveniences attached to public houses within; the Borough. These premises are inspected periodically. There are 13 public conveniences in the Borough, including, those in Recreation Grounds, Twelve of these conveniences provide accommodation for both sexes and 1 for males only.

The defects discovered as a result of these inspections were remedied after notice had been given to the persons responsible. Eighteen premises were inspected and a report was submitted to the Middlesex County Council, which is the licensing authority. Factories Act, 1937 1.

Copies of these byelaws were delivered by the sanitary inspectors to all premises where food is handled or prepared. Earlier in the year a meeting was arranged with the local traders to discuss the proposed new byelaws and a sub-committee was formed for consultative purposes. A programme of lectures and film shows was arranged and by the end of the year the staff of the school kitchens had been given a series of three lectures, and film shows and discussions were arranged to take place at the public libraries for the proprietors and staff of food premises. These latter meetings were not too well attended, the audiences consisting chiefly of proprietors and managers. It was found that only a small proportion of the assistants would give up their own time to attend, so with the co-operation of the traders it was arranged to hold talks etc., where possible in the daytime, on or near the premises where the staff are employed. A Sub-Committee of the Public Health Committee was set up to consider the implementation of the byelaws, and one of their recommendations was "that the Education Committee be requested to consider the inclusion of lectures on food hygiene in the senior schools curriculum". This was agreed and at the end of the year a programme was being worked out to commence early in 1951. At the Trades Exhibition held in October a stall was devoted to clean food propaganda. A display set was loaned by the Ministry of Food and some of the exhibits by the Central Public Health Laboratory. The stall was set up and manned by members of the staff and proved to be a very successful venture. A number of improvements have been carried out to existing food premises and in some cases very satisfactory results have been obtained. In one case an old kitchen was demolished and a completely new kitchen with tiled walls, multiple sinks and modern equipment was provided. 34 Additional sinks and wash hand basins have been provided at a number of premises, it being the aim of the department to obtain, where practicable, separate provision for hand washing, preparation of vegetables, etc., and dual sinks for washing-up, but in some instances this will not be practicable owing to the restricted kitchen space, especially in premises not originally constructed for the purpose for which they are now used. Notices drawing the attention of staff to the importance of hand-washing have been distributed and are now exhibited in most premises. Food Poisoning Three persons (three separate families) were notified as suffering from food poisoning during the year. In none of the cases was the causative organism isolated, nor were the responsible articles of food identified. Inspection of Meat and Food The inspection of food and premises where food is prepared has received special attention. Seven new registrations of hawkers were granted during the year, many of the new hawkers being "barrow boys" who live outside the Borough. Before registration is granted the Council insist upon satisfactory storage accommodation being provided and this is checked up where necessary with the Local Authority concerned. A number of summonses, particulars of which will be found under the heading "Legal Proceedings", were taken out during the year but the small fines imposed did not seem to act as a deterrent to the offenders. One thousand one hundred and sixty-four visits were made to various food premises and improvements have been carried out in a number of cases. 35 The list of condemned food is shown below: Carcases Inspected and Condemned Cattle excluding cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Number killed - - - - 75 Number inspected - - - - 75 All diseases except Tuberculosis : Whole carcases condemned - - - - - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - - - - - Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than tuberculosis - - - - - Tuberculosis only : Whole carcases condemned - - - - 1 Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - - - - 7 Percentage of the number inspected affected with tuberculosis - - - - 10.7 36 UNSOUND FOOD CONDEMNED, 1950 Tuberculosis Pigs 1 Carcase and Offal 3 Heads 4 Plucks Unsound Cattle 472½ lbs.

Occasional slaughtering is carried out on permit from the Food Office. Humane Slaughter of Animals In accordance with the provisions of the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933, all animals, including sheep, slaughtered in a slaughterhouse within the district must be stunned by means of a mechanically operated instrument kept in good repair. This method of slaughter continues to prove satisfactory. Licensed Slaughtermen The Act also provides that no animal shall be slaughtered or stunned by any person who is not the holder of a licence granted by the local authority. The licences granted by the Council have to be renewed annually. The number of persons licensed under the Act during 1950 was 4. Butchers' Shops There are 48 butchers' shops in the Borough. All the shops are provided with glass fronts. These premises have been visited and the provisions of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations which provide for the cleanliness of the premises, apparatus, utensils and vehicles, the precautions to be taken against the contamination of meat, the storage and removal of refuse, etc., have generally been well observed. Bakehouses The number of bakehouses in the Borough is 29. At 25 bakehouses motive power is used. The bakehouses have been visited by the inspectors and steps have been taken to cause them to be maintained in a proper sanitary condition. The periodical cleansing of these premises, as required by statute, has generally been carried out. A new flour sieving and blending machine was installed at one bakehouse. Successful legal proceedings were instituted with regard to the unsatisfactory condition of one of the premises. 39 Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Owing to new legislation which came into force in 1949 the number of premises requiring registration has been reduced, there now being only 9. At the two dairies in the District new bulk storage tanks have been provided and at one a new High Temperature Short Time pasteurising plant has been installed. Milk (Special Designations) Regulations Licences were granted by the Council in respect of designated milk for the year ended 31st December. 1950, as follows: Dealers' licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 18 „ „ „ „ Pasteurised 17 „ „ „ „ Sterilised 18 Supplementary licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested . 7 „ „ „ „ Pasteurised 8 „ „ „ „ Sterilised 7 Two samples of Tuberculin Tested milk were taken and submitted for bacteriological examination. These samples complied with the prescribed conditions. Ice Cream Premises The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations, 1947, control the method by which ice cream should be manufactured. Only two persons make ice cream within the Borough, and both employ the method known as "complete cold mix" which only requires the addition of water. Most of the ice cream sold is manufactured outside the Borough. There are 123 premises registered for the sale of ice cream. Twenty samples were taken during the year. Coffee Stalls The number of coffee stalls in the Borough is two. Both are situated on the main roads. They are visited at intervals and action is taken to secure the provision of a satisfactory water supply, suitable means of food storage, cleanliness of stalls and utensils and proper means for the storage and disposal of refuse. 40 Fish Friers This business is established at 8 premises. Game Licences Twenty-three applications were received under Section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1894, from tradesmen in the Borough for licences to deal in game. A licence was granted in each instance. Shops Acts. 1912-1936 Inspection of shops in the Borough has been carried out and complaints and contraventions dealt with. Particulars in regard to the shops on the Register are as follows: Number on register at beginning of 1950 901 Number closed 20 New shops 4 No. on register at end of 1950 885 Changes of occupancy 36 Legal Proceedings Legal proceedings were taken in the following instances: (1) Five street traders were summonsed for 12 offences including 5 cases of failure to register as hawkers under Section 279 of the Middlesex County Council Act and 7 instances of failure to exhibit names and addresses as required by Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. Fines amounting to £5-15-0 and costs totalling £3-13-0 were imposed. (2) A summons was taken out against a firm for the sale of bread containing flies. A fine of £5-5-0 was imposed and £5-5-0 costs were awarded. (3) The occupiers of a bakehouse were summonsed with regard to the dirty and unsatisfactory condition of the premises. They were fined £9-0-0 and ordered to pay £5-5-0 costs. Swimming Pools In co-operation with the Borough Engineer and Surveyor samples of the water in all three pools were taken at intervals throughout the summer months. 41 Additional samples were taken during hot spells when the pools were exceptionally busy. On all occasions the bacteriological reports on these samples were entirely satisfactory. Water Supply During the year the water supply of the Borough has been satisfactory in quality and in quantity. The bulk of the water is supplied by the Barnet District Water Company and copies of reports on 7 samples which were taken by the Company during the year and submitted for bacteriological examination to the Counties Public Health Laboratory were forwarded to me. In all cases the results were very satisfactory. All dwelling-houses in the Borough are supplied with water from public water mains direct to the houses with the exception of 10 houses serving a population of 27 which are served by standpipes. Smoke Abatement The factory chimneys in the area have been kept under observation and generally little nuisance from smoke or grit has. occurred. At one factory gas ignition was installed, obviating the emission of smoke and fumes when the boilers are lighted in the morning. Burial of the Dead Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948 reads as follows: "It shall be the duty of every authority to which the above section applies to cause to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died or been found dead in their area, in any case where it appears to the Authority that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have been or are being made otherwise than by the Authority. An Authority may recover from the estate of the deceased person or from any person who for the purposes of this Act was liable to maintain the deceased person immediately before his death expenses incurred for burial". Two such burials were carried out during the year. 42 RODENT CONTROL During the year 393 complaints were received. Of these, 229 were of rats and 164 of mice. The following table shows that since last year complaints of rats have slightly increased, while of mice, there was an increase of nearly 50%. Premises from which complaints have been received Premises where infestation was confirmed Premises where infestation was not confirmed 1949 1950 1949 1950 1949 1950 Rats 226 229 153 162 73 67 Mice 114 164 97 146 17 18 Total 340 393 250 308 90 85 In addition, resulting from these complaints received, rats were found at 72 other premises. Rats were found in and around places where poultry was kept in 52 cases. This figure represents 22.2% of the infestations. 43 Summary of Infestations Rats Mice Visrts in conncction with infestations 3115 839 No. of confirmed infestations 234 146 Prebaits 5230 — Zinc Phosphide P 264 146 Arsenic O 84 - I Red Squill s 47 — o A.N.T.U N 20 — Barium Carbonate s 2 — Ten smoke tests were applied to rat burrows which revealed defects in drainage at live premises. treatment of sewers Sausage Rusk with Zinc Phosphide, and Bread Mash with Arsenic were used alternately, in carrying out the maintenance treatment of sewers. In conjunction with Barnet Urban District Council, tests were carried out at points where the Barnet sewers discharge into Finchley sewers. Baits were observed over a period of five days and no 'takes' were recorded. 44 Two maintenance treatments were carried out during the year, with the following results: Type of Take First Treatment Second Treatment Poison take 57 44 No Poison take 319 252 Total number of manholes baited 376 296 The results of the poison takes in each treatment represent approximately 15% of the total number of manholes baited. This figure is a very satisfactorily low percentage. 45 INDEX page Bacteriological Work 20 Bakehouses 39 Births and Birth Rate 5, 6, 7 Burial of the Dead 42 Butchers' Shops 39 Coffee Stalls 40 Committee Members 2 Common Lodging Houses 30 Complaints 30 Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops 40 Deaths and Death Rate 5, 6, 7, 13 Diphtheria 16, 17 Diphtheria Immunisation 16 Disinfection 29 Disinfestation 29 Enquiries—Outstanding Sanitary Notices 29 Factories 31 Fish Friers 41 Food Hygiene 33 Food Poisoning 35 Came Licences 41 Houses Let in Lodgings 29 Houses Unfit for Human Habitation 25 Housing Statistics 24 Ice Cream Premises 40 Infantile Mortality 5, 6, 10, 11 Infectious Diseases 16 Inspections by Sanitary Inspectors 26 Legal Proceedings 41 Maternal Mortality 5, 6 Measles 19 Meat and Food Inspections 35 Medical Examinations 23 46 Milk (Special Designations) Regulations 40 Mortuary 9 Notices Served 29 Places of Public Entertainment 31 Pneumonia 19 Poliomyelitis 19 Population 5, 6 Rodent Control 43 Sanitary Circumstances of the Area 24 Sanitary Conveniences 30 Sanitary Improvements carried out 27 Scarlet Fever 19 Shops Acts 41 Slaughter of Animals 39 Slaughterhouses 39 Slaughtermen 39 Smoke Abatement 42 Staff 2 Statistics 5, 15 Stillbirths 5, 6 Swimming Pools 41 Tuberculosis 20, 21 Unsound Food 37 Vital Statistics 15 Water Supply 42 Whooping Cough 19 47 Printed by Finchley Press Ltd., 176 High Road, N.2
