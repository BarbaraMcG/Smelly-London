To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report on the Vital Statistics and the conditions affecting the health of the Borough for the year 1906. The statistics of births, deaths and infectious diseases relate to the 52 weeks ending December 29th, 1906. POPULATION. The population of Fulham as enumerated at the Census taken on April 6th, 1901, was 137,289, having increased from 113,781 during the previous five years. Phe population in the middle of 1906, estimated in the usual way on the assumption that the rate of increase which prevailed between 1896 and 1901, has been maintained since, was 161,965, but as during the last two years there has been a marked falling off in the number of new houses built, consequent upon most of the available land being now occupied, this is probably too high a figure, and the statistics in this report are based upon an estimated population of 159,350. The following table shows the increase of the population of the Borough during the past 55 years:— 6 TABLE I. Year. Population. Increase per cent, during previous intercensal period.

The marriages registered during the year numbered 1,203, compared with 1,207, 1,227, and 1,182 in the three preceding years. The marriage-rate—i.e., the number of persons married per 1,000 inhabitants—was 15.1, the average rate for the previous 10 years being 16.2. BIRTHS AND BIRTH-RATE. The total number of births registered in the Borough during the year was 4,767—2,480 males and 2,287 females. This is equivalent to a birth-rate of 29.9 per 1,000 of the estimated population, which is the lowest yet recorded in Fulham. The steady decline in the birth-rate of Fulham of recent years, which is common to all civilised nations, will be seen on reference to Table II. 7 TABLE II.

Note.-The deaths included in Column 7 of this table are the whole of those registered during the year as having actually occurred within the district or division. The deaths included in Column 12 are the number in Column 7, corrected by the subtraction of the number in Column 10 and the addition of the number in Column 11. By the term "Non-residents" is meant persons brought into the district on account of sickness or infirmity, and dying in public institutions there; and by the term "Residents" is meant persons who have been taken out of the district on account of sickness or infirmity, and have died in public institutions elsewhere. The ''Public In stitutions" taken into account for the purposes of these tables are those into which persons are habitually received on account of sickness or infirmity, such as hospitals, workhouses, and lunatic asylums. The births are not corrected by the distribution of those occurring in Lying-in Institutions. Area of District in acres exclusive of area covered by water), 1,703-5. Total population at all ages 137,249 Number of inhabited houses 18,534 Census at 1901. Average number of persons per house 7.4 8 Of the 4,767 births registered, 166 took place in the Workhouse, and the mothers of 43 of these children had resided outside the Borough before admission; while the births of 129 children, whose mothers belonged to Fulham, occurred in Lying-in Institutions situate in other boroughs; so that the corrected total for the Borough was 4,853, representing a rate of 30.5 per 1,000. The birth-rate of the County of London was 26.7, which was lower than that recorded in any preceding year. Among the various Metropolitan Boroughs the birthrates, after being corrected by distributing the births which occurred in the chief Lying-in Institutions to the boroughs in which the mothers had resided previous to admission, ranged from 16.5 in Hampstead, 16.7 in the City of London, and 17.2 in Westminster, to 34.2 in Shoreditch, 34.5 in Bethnal Green, and 35.3 in Stepney. The following table gives the number of births and the birth-rates in the various wards corrected by the distribution of the births occurring in the Workhouse, but exclusive of the births in Lying-in Institutions outside the Borough:― TABLE III.

The illegitimate births number 263—155 males and 108 females—or 5.3 per cent, of the total births registered in the Borough. 9 Still-horn Children. 131 still-born children were buried in Fulham Cemetery, being in the proportion of one still-born child to every 37 living. Excess of Births over Deaths. The natural increase of the population of the Borough by the excess of births over deaths was 2,550, compared with 2,390, 2,559, and 2,417 in the three preceding years. The above represents the births before " distribution''; if these are corrected for those occurring in Lying-in Institutions the excess of births over deaths was 2,636. DEATHS AND DEATH-RATE. The deaths of 2,192 persons—1,064 males and 1,128 females—were registered in Fulham during the year, but of these 302—1(51 males and 141 females―were of persons not residing in the district who died in public institutions within the Borough; while the deaths of 327 persons―196 males and 131 females—belonging to Fulham occurred outside the district chiefly in various public institutions. There were, therefore, 2,217 deaths of persons belonging to Fulham—1,099 males and 1,1 18 females—being in the proportion of 13.9 deaths per 1,000 persons living; the rate for males being 14.7, and for females 13.3. With the exception of that for 1903, which was also 13.9, this is the lowest death-rate recorded in Fulham. The death-rate of the County of London for 1906 was 15.1. Among the Metropolitan Boroughs the lowest deathrates were 9.4 in Hampstead, 11.5 in Stoke Newington, 12.0 in Lewisham, and 12.8 in Wandsworth; and the highest 18.9 in Bethnal Green, 19.6 in Shoreditch, 19.7 in Bermondsey, and 20.7 in Finsbury. b 10 TABLE IV.

They are also, in columns 9-16, included among the deaths in their respective "Localities " according to the previous addresses of the deceased as given by the Registrars. Deaths of "Non-residents " occurring in public institutions in the district are in like manner excluded from columns 2-8 and 9-16 of Table IV. (b) See notes on Table II. as to the meaning of "Residents" and "Non-residents," and as to the "Public Institutions" taken into account for the purposes of these Tables. (c) All deaths occurring in public institutions situated within the district, whether of "Residents " or of "Non-residents," are, in addition to being dealt with as in note (a), entered in the last column of Table IV. (d) Under the heading of "Diarrhoea " are included deaths registered as due to Epidemic diarrhoea, Epidemic enteritis, Infective enteritis, Zymotic enteritis. Summer diarrhoea, Dysentery and Dysenteric diarrhoea, Choleric diarrhoea, Cholera and Cholera Nostras. In addition, and as regards deaths of children under one year of age, under the heading "Diarrhoea" in column 3 (Table IV.) are included all deaths classified as "Diarrhœa! diseases" in Table VII. (e) Under the heading of "Enteritis" in TablelV., are included only deaths over one year of age registered as due to Enteritis, Muco-enteritis, Gastroenteritis, Gastric catarrh, Gastritis, and Gastro-intestinal catarrh, unless from information obtained by inquiry from the certifying practitioner or otherwise, the Medical Officer of Health has reason for including such deaths, under the specific term " Diarrhoea." Deaths from diarrhoea secondary to some other well-defined disease are included under the latter. (f) Under the headings of "Cancer" and "Puerperal fever" are included all registered deaths from causes comprised within these general terms. Thus: Under "Cancer" are included deaths from Cancer, Carcinoma, Malignant disease, Scirrhus. Epithelioma, Sarcoma, Villous tumour, and Papilloma of bladder, Rodent ulcer. Under "Puerperal Fever" are included deaths from Pyæmia, Septicæmia, Sapræmia, Pelvic peritonitis, Peri- and Endo-Metritis occurring in the Puerperium. (g) Under "Congenital Defects" in Table VII. are included deaths from Atelectasis, Icterus neonatorum, Navel haemorrhage, Malformations and Congenital hydrocephalus. (h) Under "Tuberculous Meningitis" are included deaths from Acute hydrocephalus. (i) Under "Other Tuberculous Diseases" are included deaths from Tuberculosis, Tuberculosis of bones, joints and other organs. Lupus and Scrofula. (j) All deaths certified by registered Medical Practitioners and all Inquest cases are classed as "Certified"; all other deaths are regarded as "Uncertified.' B 2 12 Distribution of Deaths. Table IV., which is prepared in accordance with the instructions of the Local Government Board, gives the causes of, and at the ages at, death. In Table IV. will also be found the numbers and the causes of the deaths in the several wards of the Borough, and Table V. gives the annual death-rates of each ward since 1890, when the existing division of the Borough was made.

Death-rates, of course, vary considerably in different districts according to the characters of the population of these districts; as in a district with a population comprising a large number of infants or very old people the death-rate would of necessity be higher than that of a district containing a large proportion of people of middle age. The Medical Officer of 13 Health of the County of London has published a factor for the correction of differences in the age and sex constitution of each Metropolitan Borough; the multiplication of the recorded death-rate of the district by this factor gives the death-rate which would obtain if the sex and age constitution of the population were in the same proportion as it is in the whole of England and Wales, thus eliminating the difference due to age and sex. Corrected in this way, the death-rates of Fulham, the County of London, and the adjoining boroughs, were as under:— TABLE VI. Crude Death-rate. 1906. Corrected Death-rate. 1906. Fulham 13.9 14.5 Kensington 13.8 14.9 Chelsea 15.7 16.3 Hammersmith 14.8 15.4 County of London 15.1 15.9 Seasonal Mortality. The mortality in the four quarters of the year was as under:— Deaths. Death-rate. First quarter 549 13.8 Second quarter 479 12.0 Third quarter 569 14.3 Fourth quarter 620 15.6 Mortality in Former Years. In Table II. will be found the number of deaths and the death-rate for each of the 10 preceding years. The difference between the rate for 1906 and the average rate for the 10 preceding years, 1896 to 1905, represents a saving of 428 lives. MORTALITY AT DIFFERENT AGES. Infantile Mortality. Of the 2,217 deaths registered, 649, or 29.8 per cent, were of infants under one year of age, and the rate of infant mortality measured by the proportion of deaths under one year 14 of age to births registered was 136 per 1,000 or 134 per 1,000, after distribution of the births in the chief Lying-in Institutions. Taking, as in former years, the uncorrected rate, this was 20 per 1,000 below the decennial average, and was lower than in any year, excepting 1903. The corresponding corrected rate of the County of London was 131, and among the various Metropolitan Boroughs the lowest rates were 77 in Hampstead, 101 in the City of London, and 102 in Stoke Newington; while the highest were 155 in Bethnal Green, 160 in Finsbury, and 163 in Shoreditch. In England and Wales the rate of infantile mortality was 133 per 1,000, and in the 76 great towns it averaged 145 per 1,000. Causes of Infantile Mortality. The following tables give the causes of infantile deaths at various periods under one year in the whole of the Borough, and in the several wards into which it is divided. Of the 649 deaths, 126, or 19.4 per cent., occurred in the first week, and 196, or 30.2 per cent., in the first four weeks of life. In the second month 9.1 per cent., and in the third month 7.6 per cent, of the deaths under one year occurred, or 46.9 per cent, in the first three months of life. In the second three months 22 per cent., during the third three months 17.3 per cent., and during the last three months 13.8 per cent, of all the first year deaths occurred. Of the deaths occurring in the first month, upwards of twothirds were ascribed to prematurity, or congenital defects, including atrophy and debility, these being mainly due to the ill-health or defective nutrition of the mother. Of the deaths occurring after the first month no less than 222, or 49 per cent, of all the deaths at the ages of one to 11 months, were due to diarrhoeal diseases; the death-rate of infants under one year of age from these being 47.8 per 1,000 births 15 in Fulham, as compared with 35.0 in the County of London, but it should be noted that although owing to climatic conditions the diarrhœal death-rate in 1906 was 10 per 1,000 higher than in 1905, the infantile death-rate from all causes was 9 per 1,000 lower. Lists of the births in the Borough attended by midwives are now received weekly, and these returns in 1906 comprised 1,873 births, or nearly 40 per cent, of the total number. The homes of these mothers were visited by Mrs. Davies, the Sanitary Inspector, who gives verbal and printed advice, and takes steps to remedy insanitary conditions. Experience, however, shows that to be really effective the visiting must be frequent, but with only one person, who has many other duties, engaged in the work, this is obviously impossible, and in a recent report to the Council on the matter I have again advocated the utilisation of the services of voluntary workers in the Borough, to be organised and supervised by a lady acting under the Council, who preferably should be a registered medical practitioner. The results obtained in other districts where systematic visiting has been thoroughly carried out encourage the hope that by similar efforts infantile mortality in Fulham might be materially lowered, especially as the relative excess in Fulham is entirely due to the heavy mortality from diarrhoea—an eminently preventible disease mainly caused by careless or ignorant methods of feeding. The proportion of the babies visited by Mrs. Davies who were said to be solely breast fed was as under:— Age. Number visited. Number suckled. Percentage suckled. Under one month 306 285 93.1 One to two months 373 342 91.8 Two to three months 221 184 83.3 Three to six months 280 215 70.8 Six to nine months 75 47 62.7 1,255 1,073 85.6 16 At the Infantile Mortality Conference held at the Caxton Hall, Westminster, on June 13th and 14th, at which the Council was represented, the following resolutions were passed, viz.:— 1. That the Education Department be urged to add instruction in elementary hygiene, with reference to the dietary and rearing of infants, to their present scheme, for systematically training girls in the practice and principles of personal hygiene and the elements of dietary. 2. That in the opinion of this Conference immediate legislation is required enabling Sanitary Authorities to establish or support depots for the supply of fare, or modified or sterilised milk, and to defray any cost out of the moneys available for public health purposes. 8. That in view of the information submitted, the Conference is of opinion that all still-births should be notified within 48 hours to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which they occur, and that no burial should take place without a medical certificate. 4. That notification of all births be given within 48 hours to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which they occur. 5. That in the opinion of this Conference the question of the insurance of infant lives under twelve months is one demanding serious consideration, and with a view to receiving reliable information, the Government should be asked to appoint a departmental Committee of inquiry on the whole question. 6.

Population—13,350 (estimated to middle of 1906). 27 Infantile Death-rates. The infantile death-rates in the several wards of the Borough since 1901, when particulars of the localities of births were first obtained, are given in the following table : TABLE VIII. Deaths under one year per 3,000 Births. 1901. 1902. 1903. 1904. 1905. 1906. Baron's Court Ward 156 137 100 186 111 91 (88) LillieWard 154 165 143 143 153 142 (137) Walham Ward 201 170 147 191 189 172 (166) Margravine Ward 116 136 143 158 132 139 (171) Munster Ward 153 134 129 145 141 145 (142) Hurlingham Ward 149 100 106 162 99 161 (150) Sands End Ward 176 184 123 157 170 128 (127) Town Ward 119 107 77 122 106 73 (72) The figures for 1906 (in brackets), are the rates after the distribution of the births in the Fulham Workhouse. The increase of the infantile death-rate in Margravine Ward after this correction is especially noticeable. Deaths of Illegitimate Children. 96 of the children who died before attaining the age of one year were illegitimate, the mortality among them being in the proportion of 365 deaths to every 1,000 births, compared with 123 deaths to every 1,000 births among children c2 28 born in wedlock. 39 of the deaths of illegitimate children, or 40 per cent. of the total number, were ascribed to diarrhœal diseases representing a mortality of 148 per 1,000, or 25 per 1,000 in excess of the mortality of legitimate children from all causes It must, however, be remembered that in estimating the mortality among illegitimates, the births of children of Fulham women occurring in Lying-in Institutions outside the Borough are not included. It is probable that the proportion of illegitimates among these is high, and if they were taken into account the illegitimate mortality would be somewhat decreased. The following table gives the causes of deaths of illegitimate infants:— 29 TABLE IX. MORTALITY OF ILLEGITIMATE INFANTS. Deaths from stated Causes in Weeks and Months under One Year of Age.

Between the ages of one and five years 280 deaths were recorded, so that the deaths of children under the age of five years numbered 929, or 42 per cent. of the total number. These deaths were equivalent to an annual rate of 44.9 per 1,000 of the population estimated to be living at that age. Insurance of Infants. Certificates under the Friendly Societies were issued in respect of 502 children under the age of live years; 54 per cent. of the children dying at this age period being insured. Mortality at School Age. At the ages of 5 to 15 years, which is approximately the school period of life, there were 77 deaths, or 3.5 per cent. of those at all ages, representing a mortality of 2.4 per 1,000 of those living at that age. Mortality at Adolescence. Between the ages of 15 and 25 years 94 deaths, or 4.4 per cent. of the total number were recorded, the rate of mortality at this age period being 3.3 per 1,000. Mortality at Maturity. 687, or 31 per cent. of the deaths occurred between the ages of 25 and 65 years, the mortality at this age period being at the rate of 9.5 per 1,000. Mortality at Decline. At the age of 65 and upwards 430 deaths were registered, or 19.4 per cent. of those at all ages, corresponding to a death-rate of 82.4 per 1,000. DEATHS FROM INFECTIOUS DISEASES. To the seven principal infectious diseases 391 deaths were ascribed, corresponding to a death-rate of 2.45 per 1,000, which was 0.46 per 1,000 below the average rate of the ten preceding years. 31 The death-rate from these diseases in the County of London was 1.93; the mean rate in the 10 years, 1896-1905, being 2.32 per 1,000. In the Metropolitan Borough the death-rates from these infectious diseases ranged from 0.57 in Hampstead, 0.84 in Westminster, and 1.08 in the City of London, to 2.95 in Poplar, 3.15 in Shoreditch, and 3.59 in Finsbury. In Table X. will be found the number of deaths from each of the principal infectious diseases in 1906 and in the ten preceding years, and in Table XL the death-rate per 1,000 of the population of each ward in 1906. In these tables, as in former years, the deaths ascribed to Gastro-enteritis, Gastritis, Gastro-enteric Catarrh, etc., among children under one year are not included under Diarrhœa as in Table IV. 32 TABLE X.

Fatality.—The disease was the cause of 18 deaths representing a case mortality of 2.7 percent., which was slightly below that of 1905, when it was 3 per cent. Return Cases.—Twelve cases occurred within fourteen days of the return of a child living in the same house, from one of the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals after recovery from a similar attack. Distribution.—In Table XIII. will be found the number of cases notified in each ward of the Borough, and the following table shows the proportional prevalence of Scarlet Fever in the several wards during 1906 and the preceding ten years. 39 TABLE XVIII.

The cases occurring in the four quarters of the year were:— Cases. Deaths. 1st Quarter 103 9 2nd „ 78 6 3rd „ 65 2 4th „ 157 16 The 403 cases occurred in 342 houses as under:- Houses with one case 296 „ „ two cases 37 „ „ three „ 5 „ „ four „ 2 „ „ five „ 2 40 Isolation.—867 patients, or 90.8 per cent. of those certified to be suffering from the disease, were removed to the hospital for treatment. School Outbreaks. In February the occurrence of three cases of Diphtheria in one of the girls' classes at Hugon Road School led to the bacteriological examination of the throats of the other girls in the class. No case was detected, but four sisters, one being a member of the affected class, who had been absent when the first examination was made, were subsequently found to be suffering from mild Diphtheria and were removed to hospital, after which there were no further cases. In July the examination of the children in one of the Infant classes at Clancarty Road School consequent upon the occurrence of some cases led to the detection of one child with clinical symptoms of Diphtheria, and another whose culture showed true Diphtheria bacilli. In April one of the boarders at a private school in Fulham was notified as suffering from Diphtheria, and a bacteriological examination of the boarders showed that four others were also affected, who were removed to hospital. Two day scholars in attendance at the school were also found to have Diphtheria. The school was closed for three weeks, and there were no further cases after the reopening. In October there were two cases in one of the Girls classes at St. Dunstan's School, and on examination of the others, one child in attendance was found to be harbouring the bacillus. Distribution. The following table gives the number of cases notified per 10,000 of the population of each ward since 1896:— 41 TABLE XIX.

The fatality of hospital cases was 6.7 per cent., and of cases not removed 22.2 per cent. The reduction of recent years in the fatality of Diphtheria, due mainly to the use of antitoxic serum, will be seen from the following table:— 42 TABLE XX. Year. Number of Cases. Number of Deaths. Deaths per 1,000 Inhabitants. Deaths per 100 Cases. 1890 93 22 0.25 23.7 1891 82 19 0.21 23.2 1892 111 30 0.32 27.0 1893 250 65 0.63 26.1 1894 342 108 0.99 31.6 1895 386 77 0.70 20.0 1896 355 78 0.66 22.0 1897 388 62 0.52 16.3 1898 476 61 0.49 12.8 1899 528 59 0.45 11.2 1900 641 65 0.50 10.2 1901 636 48 0.35 7.5 1902 429 51 0.37 11.9 1903 293 24 0.17 8.2 1904 302 24 0.16 8.0 1905 286 24 0.15 8.4 1906 404 33 0.21 8.2 There is no doubt that if the nature of the disease were more promptly recognised, and cases treated in the earliest stages with antitoxic serum, the fatality of Diphtheria would be still further reduced. ENTERIC FEVER. Forty-five cases of Enteric Fever were notified, or 2.8 per 10,000 inhabitants; the average for the preceding ten years being 5.6 per 10,000. Of those certified to be suffering from the disease 37 or 82.2 per cent. were removed to hospital. Fatality.—In 13 cases the disease proved fatal, giving a case mortality of 29 per cent. In the following cases the eating of shellfish was followed by an attack of Enteric Fever within the period of incubation of the disease:— F. C. (f.), aged 22, in service at Chiswick, stayed at Deal from September 20th to October 4th, and ate cockles there. On her return she brought some cockles with her, which she 43 gave to her sister in Fulham. F. C. was taken ill about October 12th, came home to Fulham, and was removed to the hospital on October 22nd. Her sister, F. C., the only member of the family who ate the cockles, fell ill about October 14th, and was admitted into the hospital with Typhoid on October 25th. The cockles in question came from the estuary of the Stour. F. C. S. (m.), aged 54, had oysters at a banquet in Xew York on October 8th, fell ill about October 20th, and died from Enteric on November 20th. Several men present at the banquet were said to have had gastro-intestinal disturbance immediately afterwards, and two to have subsequently developed Typhoid, but no information was obtainable as to the other articles of food eaten at the dinner. In another case oysters were eaten at a London restaurant about fourteen days before the commencement of the illness. In two instances the patient was in the habit of frequently eating watercress. Three cases occurred in each of two houses, the secondary cases being probably due to personal infection, the nature of the primary case not being at first recognised. The incidence of Enteric Fever in Fulham during the preceding 10 years is shown in the following table:— TABLE XXL Number of Cases. Number of Cases notified per 10,000 inhabitants. Number of Deaths per 10,000 inhabitants. 1896 53 4.6 0.8 1897 53 4.4 1.0 1898 71 5.3 1.4 1899 111 8.4 1.9 1900 92 6.9 1.4 1901 133 9.7 1.5 1902 74 5.2 0.6 1903 80 5.4 1.1 1904 39 2.6 0.4 1905 56 3.6 0.6 Mean of 10 years- 1896-1905 76 5.6 1.1 1906 45 2.8 0.8 D 2 44 Errors in Diagnosis. Of the patients certified as suffering from Scarlet Fever 15 or 2.2 per cent., from Diphtheria 36 or 8.9 per cent., and from Enteric Fever 2 or 6.7 per cent. were subsequently ascertained not to be suffering from these diseases. Puerperal Fever. Seventeen cases of Puerperal Fever, or 3.5 per 1,000 births were notified, of which 4, or 0.8 per 1,000 births proved fatal. Thirteen of the patients notified were removed to the Fulham Infirmary. Erysipelas. 141 persons were certified to be suffering from Erysipelas, which was the assigned cause of 8 deaths. DEATHS FROM NON-NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Measles. The deaths from Measles in the four quarters of the year were:— No. of Deaths. 1st Quarter 23 2nd „ 15 3rd „ 9 4th „ 6 r. f. i i 53 The death-rate was 0.33 per 1,000; the mean rate for the decennium 1896-1905 being 0.57. 45 The cases which were reported to the Medical Officer of Health by the teachers of the schools numbered 496, and were distributed as under: — Cases.

The question of the provision of hospital accommodation for Measles was considered by the Public Health Committee, who recommended the Council to inform the Local Government Board that, in their opinion, hospital accommodation should be provided for the treatment of cases of Measles occurring in poor and crowded homes. The following table gives the mortality from Measles in Fulham during the preceding ten years:— 46 TABLE XXII. Year. No. of Deaths.

Thirty-one deaths were ascribed to whooping cough, representing a death-rate of 0.19 per 1,000; the mean rate for the preceding ten years being 0.49 per 1,000. Diarrhœa. Diarrhoea was the cause of 243 deaths, of which 192 or 80 per cent. were of infants under one year of age, and 37 of children aged between one and five years. In addition to these the majority of the 35 deaths ascribed to Gastro-Enteritis and kindred disorders were of the same nature, and in Table IV. the deaths registered under these names of children under the age of one year are included under the heading of Diarrhœa. The deaths in each quarter of the year were as under:— No. of Deaths, Death-rate. 1st Quarter „ 5 0.12 2nd „ 14 0.35 3rd „ . 178 4.49 4 th „ 44 1.11 241 1.51 47 The death-rate from the disease is the highest recorded, the excessive mortality being mainly due to the hot drv summer. Fulham is invariably conspicuous by a high diarrhœal mortality, and last year only two Metropolitan Boroughs— viz., Poplar and Shoreditch—had higher rates. The excessive diarrhœal mortality of Fulham, as compared with the adjoining boroughs, will be seen from the following table:— TABLE XXIII.

Phthisis accounted for 182 deaths, the decennial average corrected for the increase of population being 217; while 70 deaths were ascribed to other tubercular diseases, such as Tubercular Meningitis, Tabes Mesenterica and General Tuberculosis. In the several wards of the Borough the death-rates from Phthisis and other tubercular diseases were as follow:— 48 TABLE XXIV.

The voluntary notification of cases of Tubercular Phthisis, which was begun in 1902, has been continued, and 148 certificates were received—39 occurring in private and 119 in public practice. The cases notified in the various wards were as under:— Baron's Court Ward 3 Lillie Ward 22 Walham Ward 13 Margravine Ward 30 Munster Ward 42 Hurlingham Ward 7 Sands End Ward 25 Town Ward 6 49 In all cases in which permission could be obtained the rooms, bedding, &c., were disinfected after the removal or death of the patient.

Whether the disease in animals and man is one and the same; 2. Whether animals and man can be reciprocally fected with it; 3. Under what conditions, if at all, the transmission of the diseases from animals to man takes place, and what are the circumstances favourable or unfavourable to such transmission; have recently issued a second interim report, in which they say:— "There can be no doubt that in a certain number of cases the tuberculosis occurring in the human subject, especially in children, is the direct result of the introduction into the human body of the bacillus of bovine tuber- 50 culosis, and there also can he no doubt that in the majority at least of these cases the bacillus is introduced through cows' milk. Cows' milk containing bovine tubercle bacilli is clearly a cause of tuberculosis and fatal tuberculosis in man. A very considerable amount of disease and loss of life, especially among the young, must be attributed to the consumption of cows' milk containing tubercle bacilli. The presence of tubercle bacilli in cows' milk can be detected, though with some difficulty, if the proper means be adopted, and such milk ought never to be used as food. There is far less difficulty in recognising clinically that a cow is distinctly suffering from tuberculosis, in which case she may be yielding tuberculous milk. The milk coming from such a cow ought not to form part of human food; and, indeed, ought not to be used as food at all. Our results clearly point to the necessity of measures more stringent than those at present enforced being taken to prevent the sale or consumption of such milk." Influenza. Thirty deaths were registered from Influenza, the numbers for the three preceding years being 12, 36 and 17. DEATHS FROM OTHER DISEASES. Cancer. Malignant diseases caused 138 deaths, being 11 in excess of the average of the preceding 10 years, allowing for the increase of the population. Diseases of the Respiratory System. From these diseases there were 360 deaths, or 16.0 per cent. of the deaths from all causes, being 149 below the corrected decennial average. Food Poisoning. The death of a child aged five years was attributed to poisoning by rhubarb. 51 The rhubarb had been purchased on February 20th from a local tradesman, who had bought it at Covent Garden on that morning. It was cooked the same day, being stewed with sugar, in an enamelled saucepan, and was eaten at 1.30 by the child in question, her father,.and two sisters. Some stewed steak was also eaten at the same meal by the above and by the mother, w ho did not eat any of the rhubarb. From two to four hours afterwards the father and the three children were taken ill with vomiting and purging. The father and eldest child (aged 15) soon recovered under treatment, and were practically well within four or five days, but the two other children became very ill, the vomiting being persistent and attended with marked collapse, and the youngest died on March 1st. The other child was in a very precarious condition for some ten days longer, but eventually recovered. It was ascertained that three other persons who ate rhubarb from the same shop on that day also suffered from severe digestive disturbance. The rhubarb was grown at Chadwell Heath, in Essex, on land which was not subject to flooding and had not been manured that year. A chemical and bacteriological examination of the rhubarb threw no light on the matter. The post-mortem examination showed some gastroenteritis, and the results of a bacteriological examination of the spleen and other organs made at the Lister Institute were negative. The blood from the father and the two elder children gave a marked typhoid reaction, as it agglutinated the typhoid bacillus completely at a dilution of 1 in 50 and partly at 1 in 100 in half an hour, and gave no clumping with any of the several varieties of paratyphoid and food poisoning organisms at a dilution of 1 in 20. The possibility, however, of the cases being Typhoid was negatived by the post-mortem examination. 52 CERTIFICATION OF THE CAUSES OF DEATH. Of the 2,217 deaths registered 2,011, of 90.7 per cent. were certified by registered medical practitioners and 204 by Coroners after inquest, only two deaths being uncertified. Inquests. At the 204 inquests held on inhabitants of Fulham the following verdicts were returned:— TABLE XXVI.

Fulham Infirmary and Workhouse. In 190G the deaths of 509 persons occurred in the Infirmary, and of 33 in the Workhouse. Of these 390 belonged to Fulham and 152 to other districts. Western Fever Hospital. In the Western Fever Hospital there were 181 deaths, of which 42 belonged to Fulham and 139 to other Metropolitan Boroughs. Deaths occurring outside the Borough among persons belonging thereto. The deaths of residents in Fulham in public institutions and elsewhere outside the Borough numbered 327, and occurred in the following places: — TABLE XXVII.

DISINFECTION. All infected articles were disinfected at the Council's Disinfecting Station, Townmead Road. The total cost of the station for the year was .£996, including £96 10s. for interest on loan for building and plant, and ,£216 for repayment of principal. £104 was received from Hammersmith Borough Council for articles disinfected for them while their station was closed for repairs, so that the net cost was ,£892. During the last three years the work was done bv a contractor, the cost averaged £1,257, and at that time disinfection was not carried out after measles or phthisis, as is generally the case now. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. The facilities afforded by the Council for the bacteriological examinations of suspected material as an aid to diagnosis conlinue to be much appreciated by medical practitioners, and the following specimens were examined during the year:— Number of Specimens. Material from cases of suspected Diphtheria. Klebs Lofller or true Diphtheria bacillus isolated 85 Pseudo Diphtheria bacillus of Hoffman isolated 34 Negative result 141 260 56  r of Specimens.

FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901. The chief classes of workshops in the Borough are laundries and dressmakers. These have been regularly visited by Mrs. Davies and generally found in a fairly satisfactory condition. 57 Bakehouses. There are 69 bakehouses, of which 50 are underground. Eight breaches of the special requirements for bakehouses were dealt with. Kitchens of Restaurants and Coffee Houses. 138 inspections were made of these, and 38 notices, mainly relating to cleanliness, were served. Outworkers. The homes of the outworkers employed by firms both within and without the Borough were kept under observation. Twenty-four notices dealing with insanitary conditions were served, and in one instance outwork was prohibited in consequence of infectious disease in the outworker's home. The follow ing table, prepared at the request of the Secretary of State for the Home Department, gives a summary of the work done in connection with the Factory Act:— Administration of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, in connection with Factories, Workshops, Laundries, Workplaces and Homework. 1.—INSPECTION.

There are now 292 milkshops on the register, or 28 less than at the end of 1905, the decrease being due to the efforts made to induce small dealers with unsuitable premises to discontinue the sale of milk. An amendment of the law with regard to the registration of milkshops is necessary, as at present there is no power to refuse the registration of a milkseller, although the milkshop may be unsuitable for the purpose, and the Council have requested the London County Council to insert in its next General Powers Bill, provisions conferring powers on local authorities to enable them to prohibit the sale of milk on unsuitable premises. All the milkshops in the Borough were visited at frequent intervals by the Food Inspector. 61 Ice Creams. One hundred and five premises on which ice creams are made or sold are registered, and were regularly inspected by the District Inspectors. Cowsheds and Slaughterhouses. The licenses of the undermentioned cowsheds and slaughterhouses were renewed by the London County Council in October, no objections being raised by the Borough Council. Unsound Food. The stalls and shops where food is sold or stored have been kept under supervision. Twenty-five boxes of fish, twelve cases of fruit, and 75 rabbits, examined at the request of the owners, were condemned and destroyed. Proceedings were taken against a costermonger in North End Road for exposing for sale unsound cocoanuts, who was convicted and fined £3 with 14s. costs. Cowsheds. Premises. Licensee.

As I have before pointed out, the marked increase in adulteration of late coincides with the appointment of a special Food Inspector, and the Council would, in my opinion, make a serious mistake in reverting, as has been recently suggested, to the old method of having samples taken by all the Sanitary Inspectors instead of by one Inspector who devotes himself to this and kindred work. The 63 experience, not only of Fulham, but also of other boroughs in which the two methods have been tried, conclusively demonstrates the superiority of the latter method. With regard to milk, of which no less than 27 per cent. of the samples were certified to be adulterated, it must not be inferred that upwards of a fourth of the milk sold in Fulham is tampered with, as no account can be taken in the above figures of the actual amount of milk sold by the various vendors; and supposing, for instance, that two samples of milk taken from dealers selling gallons a day each were adulterated, and two samples from dealers selling 200 gallons a day were genuine, while 50 per cent. of the samples taken would be adulterated, only 4.8 per cent. of the actual amount of milk sold would be so, and as we find adulteration to be more common among the small dealers, the figures do not represent such wholesale sophistication of milk as at first sight they might seem to. At the same time it must be borne in mind that the adulteration statistics of other metropolitan boroughs are put in the same way, and a comparison between the percentages of adulterated samples in Fulham and London may fairly be made, by which Fulham shows very badly, as in the County of London in 1905 10.6 per cent. of the milk samples were certified to be adulterated as against 18.3 per cent. in Fulham in 1005, and 27.1 per cent. in 1906. Of the samples of butter purchased, 30 per cent. were certified as adulterated, compared with 10 per cent. in 1905. Of these 120 were purchased unofficially, of which 18 (or 10 per cent.) were found to be margarine, while of those purchased under the Food and Drugs Acts only 17 per cent. were condemned. These figures sufficiently illustrate the prevalence in Fulham of this form of fraud and the difficulty of bringing offenders to book, for in proportion as the Inspectors improve their methods of sampling so do the dishonest traders increase their precautions. The conviction was secured of a man living in a private house in another borough who was in the habit of hawking from house to house what purported to be pure butter sent to 64 him from the country. A wholesale dealer, subpoenaed by the Council, proved that the defendant had had from his firm during the preceding month 12½ cwt. of margarine, all of which had doubtless been sold as butter, and he was fined £17 and £3 3s. costs. Thirteen samples of tinned foods purchased informally were pronounced by the Analyst to be of good quality. Nine were quite free from preservatives, and in 4 small quantities of boric acid were present, the amount varying from 3 to 7 grains to the pound. The Council resolved to inform the Local Government Board that they approved of the resolution passed by the Metropolitan Branch of the Society of Medical Officers of Health, which was as follows:— " That it is necessary in order to secure better protection for the public in regard to tinned and preserved foods that legislation should be passed embodying the following important reforms:— 1. The name and address of the manufacturer, and the date of canning, shall be impressed on the cans. 2. It shall be unlawful to sell for any purpose canned goods that are unfit for human consumption, and it shall be the duty of any person in possession of unsound canned foods to notify and surrender same to the local authority, who shall destroy such unsound food free of charge. 3. A certain number of tins (say one per cent.) from each consignment shall be opened on importation and the contents examined under the supervision or instructions of the Sanitary Authority concerned, prior to such canned foods being placed on the market. 4. Tins which are known in the trade as " doubtfuls " shall be deemed to be unfit for human consumption. 5. Food intended for canning shall be inspected by pendent officials prior to being canned, and all foods shall be canned under strictly hygienic conditions, 65 t 6. That the use of preservatives in canned foods is unnecessary, and should under no circumstances be permitted." The question of increasing the number of samples has been now under the consideration of the Council for upwards of twelve months, and though I believe the necessity for this is generally recognised, still, in spite of endless discussion, nothing has yet been done. The late Council built to the designs of Mr. Cribb, the Public Analyst, and partly equipped a commodious laboratory, which they were anxious should be utilised and the analysis of all the Fulham samples conducted in it, but being unwilling to adopt the recommendation of Dr. Buchanan, the Inspector of Foods of the Local Government Board, that Mr. Cribb's offer to analyse 1,500 samples in the Town Hall laboratory at a remuneration of £625 a year, he to provide all apparatus and chemicals, should be accepted, they asked the Local Government Board to sanction the appointment of a second Public Analyst to give his whole time to the work, while Mr. Cribb continued to analyse a certain number of samples in accordance with the terms of his appointment. The Local Government Board, in reply, pointed out " that it would be obviously inconvenient that the Council should be advised by two separate and independent analysts whose views and practice might sometimes be widely divergent, and suggested that the present Analyst (Mr. Cribb), as 'Senior Public Analyst and Consulting Chemist,' should undertake, in concert with the Medical Officer of Health, the general directions of the analytical work under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and its apportionment between himself and the junior officer at the Town Hall, and that he should be responsible for the general methods employed, and for the advice given and reports made to the Council as the result of work done by both." Provided the Council were prepared to make such an arrangement, the Board stated that they would be willing to approve the proposal. 66 The present Public Health Committee then asked the Hoard to modify these conditions in the direction of making the two analysts quite independent of each other, but the Board have replied regretting that they do not see their way to assent to the second appointment on the terms suggested. So an impasse has arisen, and instead of the samples being increased the Public Health Committee have ordered that only 350 samples a year shall be taken, which is detrimental alike to the consumer and honest trader. Warra nlies. At a Conference of Representatives of Metropolitan Borough Councils as to Milk Warranties, held at the Southwark Town Hall on May 30th, 1906, the following resolutions were adopted:— " That in the opinion of this Conference the provisions of Section 25 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, and Section 20 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Amendment Act, 1899, operate to the prejudice of the purchaser and the public health, and should be repealed, leaving the seller of milk to his remedy at common law against the person from whom he purchased it." " That notices in shops, &c., to the effect that milk sold therein is not warranted as pure shall be no defence." " That the act of mixing water, or separated milk with whole milk for the purpose of sale, should be made a penal offence." " That any Metropolitan Borough Council should be enabled to sample at any railway station milk coming to dealers in the area of that Borough, although the station may be in another district." Proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts were instituted by the Council in the following cases:— 67 defendant. offence. result. penalty. costs. £ s. d. £ s. d. A.

During the year drainage plans of the following proposed new buildings were submitted to and approved by the Public Health Committee:— Dwelling Houses and Shops 182 Factories and Workshops 13 Blocks of Flats 3 Other Buildings Additions to existing Buildings 14 221 Reconstruction of Drainage. Plans for the reconstruction of the drainage of 292 buildings also received the sanction of the Committee. Combined Drainage. Eight systems of combined drainage, for portions of which the Council was liable, owing to certain of the pipes which received the drainage of more than one building, forming " sewers " within the meaning of the Metropolis Local Management Act, were reconstructed during the year at a cost to the Council of £87 6s. 1 Oct., the work being carried out by a contractor under a schedule of prices. The sum of £121 14s. 8d. was also paid to owners in respect of work executed by them in compliance with notices served by the Council at 20 houses in connection with house drains, which were " sewers " as defined by the Metropolis Management Act. CERTIFICATES UNDER THE REVENUE ACTS. Applications were received for certificates in respect of 147 dwellings, of which 77 were granted; 30 were given after certain specified works had been completed, and 44 were refused. 71 HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. New by-laws in respect of bouses let in lodgings were confirmed on March 26th, 1906. Owing to the exemption clause which provides inter alia " that a lodging-house shall be exempt from the operation of the by-laws where the keeper himself resides on the premises, and the sub-letting by such keeper is to not more than two lodgers," some two-thirds of the 329 houses that were on the register are now exempt, and, in my opinion, the exemption clause is too elastic. All the houses on the old register were inspected during the year. Any nuisances found were dealt with under the Public Health Act. HOUSES INFESTED WITH VERMIN. Section 20 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, gives power to the sanitary authority to require the cleansing of any house infested with vermin, and provides penalties for default. Notices were served in respect of 6)3 premises and complied with. CLEANSING OF PERSONS ACT. The Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, empowers every sanitary authority, " when in their discretion they see fit, to permit any person who shall apply to the said authority on the ground that he is infested with vermin to have the use free of charge of the apparatus (if any) which the authority possess for cleansing the person and his clothing from vermin." No special accommodation has been provided in Fulham for this, but in the few instances in which applications have been made, use has been made of the reception house and disinfecting station. In November last I recommended the Public Health Committee to improve the accommodation at the shelter, and to engage the necessary assistance in order that the children 72 attending school, who were found to be in a verminous condition, could be bathed and have their clothing freed from vermin, but the Committee decided not to proceed with the scheme. SMOKE ABATEMENT. Twenty-one intimations and seven statutory notices under the Public Health (London) Act were served in respect of smoke nuisances. Legal proceedings were taken in two instances ; in one a penalty of £5 was imposed, in the other the summons was dismissed and £10 10s. costs allowed to the defendant. GENERAL SANITARY WORK. The following is a summary of the sanitary work of the year:— Complaints received 1,208 Intimation notices served 2,929 Statutory notices served 934 Nuisances abated.
