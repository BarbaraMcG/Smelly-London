Frien Barnet Arban District Council ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1962 JANET R. CAMPBELL, m.6„ ch.b., d.p.h. Deputy Medical Officer of Health. Ac 439 (3) Library From LAGAN FRI 40 FRIERN 3ARNET URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the year 1962 JANET R. CAMPBELL, M.g., Ch.B., D.P.H. Deputy Medical Officer of Health. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Friern Barnet, Middlesex. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report for the year 1962. The year ended sadly with Dr. Harvey's sudden illness in October which deprived the District of his services for the remainder of the year. Dr. Harvey is still not fit to resume duty and his absence is felt particularly at this time when his wisdom and experience would have been so valuable in the planning of the new Borough. I know that he has the warm good wishes of all members of the Council. The vital statistics for 1962 were again satisfactory. The birth rate with 349 live births was 13.8 per 1000 of population. The death late was 11.0, slightly lower than last year's figure of 11.3 and also lower than that for the country as a whole, 11.9 It is very satisfactory to be able to state again this year that there were no maternal deaths. The infantile Mortality rate i.e. the number of infants who died during the first year of life per 1,000 live births, was 22.9 as against 44.7 last year - a very satisfactory drop, representing as it does 8 fewer infant deaths. The statistics over the past four years show two trends which are persistent and appear significant. The birth rate has been rising successively each year from 12.9 in 1958, 13.4 in 19591 13.8 in 1960 to 14.1 in 1961, and although it has dropped slightly to 13.8 this year the trend seems to be continuing. This rising birth-rate is taking place generally over the whole country. Less satisfactory and a cause for concern is the trend in the illegitimate birth rate i.e. the number of illegitimate births expressed as a percentage of the total live births. This rate is rising each successive year. In 1959 illegitimate births were of the total live births. In 1960 this rose to 5.08%, in 1961 to 3.7% and this year it has again risen to 7.1% of total live births. It needs little imagination to picture the problems and distress which must arise from this increasing rate. The number of infectious diseases notified during 1962 was 60 as against 489 last year. This was accounted for by a similar fall in the number of cases of measles. The infectious sickness rate was 2.1, the lowest on record, as compared with 17.2 during 1961. It is of note that no deaths during the year were due to notificable infectious disease. This is a complete and dramatic reversal of the position a few decades ago when the high mortality from infectious diseases struck in the early years of life. -1- No cases of poliomyelitio were notified during the year and it is now five years since a case of poliomyelitis occurred in Friern Barnet. Our last case of diphtheria was seven years ago. Notifications of whooping cough were six, a very satisfactory figure. Health education is a continuous process for the Health Department right through the year. The choice and supply of public posters, library book marks and advice leaflets is constantly under review. The display of health education material regularly staged in the Town Hall kiosk reflects great credit on Mr. Jackaman and the staff of the Public Health Department. In order to retain public interest in such a display there must be a regular and frequent change of subject material together with a sense of timing. The recent addition of special lighting will, I am sure, add further to this value. In last year's report Dr. Harvey made reference to the increasing work devolving upon the Public Health Inspectors. This work is in no way abating and the position will have to be kept under careful review. Dr. Harvey's combined appointment of District Medical Officer and County Area Medical Officer has ensured over the years close integration of these two functions and similarly the very close and friendly co-operationbetween the two categories of staff should prove a great asset towards the smooth changeover to the new Borough. In conclusion, I owe a debt of gratitude to the members of the Public Health Committee and would expresit them my sincere thanks for their support and kindness - an expression in which I know Dr. Harvey would wish to be associated. I find it difficult to express fully my appreciation of the loyalty and support which I have received from Mr. Jackaman, and indeed, every member of the staff of the Public Health Department. Without this, my task in suddenly taking over Dr. Harvey's work would have been difficult indeed. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J.R.Campbell Deputy Medical Officer of Health. -2- -3- PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE. at 31st. December 1962. Cr. K. J.

The number of births assigned to the district was 349, giving a Birth-Rate of 12.3 per 1000 of the population. The correcting factor for age and sex distribution so far as Friern Barnet is concerned is 1.12. so that the rate for comparative purposes was 13.8. The corresponding Birth-Rate for England and Wales was 18.0. Birth and Birth-Rates for the past five years have been:- Birth-Rates. Year. No. of Births. Friern Barnet. England & Wales. 1958 328 12.9 16.4 1959 344 13.4 16.5 1960 354 13.8 17.1 1961 358 14.1 17.4 1962 349 13.8 18.0 DEATHS. There were 445 deaths during the year. Of these 148 occurred in Friern Hospital and 297 in the district. This provides an un-corrected Death-Rate of 15.7 per 1000 for the total population, and 11.3 per 1000 for the district excluding Friern Hospital. The correcting factor for age and sex distribution is 0.71, providing a Death-Rate for comparative purposes of 11.0. The corresponding rate for England and Wales was 11.9.

The nett number of deaths accredited to the district was 445, 21 less than in 1961. This gives a crude death rate of 15.7 per 1,000 of the total population and 11.3 for the district excluding Friern Hospital, with a corrected death rate of 11.0 (the rate for 1961 being 11.3)• There was a rise of 43 in the deaths from diseases of the heart and circulatory system. There was a small but welcome drop in the deaths due to cancer of the lung from 28 to 20, but deaths from bronchitis rose from 27 to 33. The heavy toll of life from these two group causes could be considerably reduced, but its reduction involves the most difficult of all remedies - the changing of habits that are set and built in to the way of life. Contributory factors in Coronary Diseases are undoubtedly the stress and rush of present day living. A three-mile walk daily would be an excellent prescription coupled with sensible and moderate eating to prevent increase of weight. It is surely an obvious assumption that the heart can do its job more efficiently without an added load of a stone or more imposed upon it just when it is beginning to age. The following table shows the deaths from cancer of the lung and bronchus and deaths from bronchitis for Friern Barnet over the past 10 years. Deaths from Cancer of the Lung and Bronchus. Male.

Only methods of education that carry conviction will succeed in such an extraordinarily difficult task. The method which succeeded in the great proportion of doctors was a cold statistical survey which showed clearly how many of their colleagues who were smokers were dying of cancer of the lung. If the same precipitous drop in this habit could be effected in those to whom children look for example particularly parents and teachers - the chances of a reduction in smoking would materially increase throughout the whole population. Since smoking is comparable to drug addiction the main effort must be to prevent young people from starting the habit. Addicts may say "This is my business'1 it concerns my life, but there are few individuals whose life is not precious to someone and whose death does not bring tragedy and irretrievable loss to others. The evidence against smoking is now so overwhelming that most smokers concede it as a cause of lung cancer and would wish to give it up. Clever advertising is probably the strongest factor in defeating the best resolutions and counter propaganda must be extremely skilful to compete with it. The pipe smoker has much more control over the amount of tobacco he smokes since he is not constantly having a tobacco pouch passed to him by his friends. In face of the tremendous difficulty in eradicating the habit of cigarette smoking could it at least be replaced by the pipe smoking habit - with attractive pipes for ladies! And since it is a more natural habit it might even become -8- attractive to teenagers who want to be "with it". Smokers' clinics have been started up and down the country and their methods and degree of success are being critically studied. In spite of these rather gloomy comments it must be borne in mind that it is only because so many other major causes of death have been eradicated and also that more money is available to spend on cigarettes and a great variety of confectionery that these diseases of the older age groups are rising in importance. With each decade not only are many more infants living to reach their second year, but this second year seems almost like a spring-board to give them a flying start in life so that the loss of life up to the age of 45 is almost neglible. On the basis of the 1962 statistics of 349 live births 341 babies would survive to reach their second year. In Friern Barnet's total child population from the age of 1 year to 15 years the total number of deaths was one, and between the ages of 15 and 45 they totalled 14. Immunisation has played a very large part in this success story but it requires constant vigilance to ensure that it continues at its present high level. Diphtheria and poliomyelitis are still menacing diseases that could return again as a cause of death and crippling. Infant Mortality. There were 8 deaths of infants under 1 year of age. This gives an infant death rate of 22.9 per 1,000 live births as compared with 16 deaths and a rate of 44.7 in the preceding year. Of the 8 infants who died in Friern Barnet during 1962 before they had reached the age of 12 months, 7 died under four weeks; 6 failed to survive one week - in fact died the first day. These very early deaths are the hardest of all to prevent. Every infant death is carefully scrutinised. Five stillbirths, all legitimate, were accredited to the District for 1962. This is equal to a death rate of 14.1 (live and still births), the corresponding figures for 1961 being 10 stillbirths with a rate of 27.2. As mentioned in the introduction to this Report, no maternal deaths were reported during 1962. -9- GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES. Care of the Aged. The greater expectancy of life, with the increase of the number of aged people in the community creates many very special problems and with these a responsibility which is really that of the whole community. It is in this field, probably more than in any other, that voluntary effort is so vital. We are extremely fortunate in the work that is done in the District by the Old People's Welfare Committee. Many of the problems, however, are brought to the Public Health Department and we are then able to call upon the Health Visitors, Home Nurses, Home Help Organisers, and Public Health Inspectors to assess the need so that we can estimate how best to render help. Retired Persons' Advice Clinics were opened this year in Wood Green and Southgate. These clinics, are staffed by one of the County Assistant Medical Officers, together with a member of the nursing staff. The sessions are informal and advice is given on health matters and also on hobbies, activities etc. They are well attended and I believe are fulfilling a very useful function. Although no such clinics have yet been established in Friern Barnet it is hoped to provide this service in the near future. It seems that there will always be some geriatric problems which are almost insoluble but these additions to the services of the elderly will be welcome. Hospitals. The remarks contained in the Annual Report for 1961 relating to the hospital services available to Friern barnet remain more or less unaltered. Laboratory Facilities. As in past years, the Central Public Health Laboratory Service has been of the greatest assistance to us, not only the Central Laboratory at Oolindale, but also the Laboratory at Coppetts Wood Hospital. I gratefully acknowledge the assistance afforded throughout the year, and the close co-operation which has continued for so many years between the Public Health Department and the Laboratory Service. -10- Summary of the work carried out at the Public Health Laboratories for the year: Throat and nose swabs 5 Faeces 110 Urine 3 Ice cream 69 Milk 134 Kaviar 1 Ham 1 Minced meat 12 Vaginal swabs 2 National Assistance Act 1948.

From the table of infectious diseases set out on Page 28 it will be seen that 60 cases of infectious diseases were notified during the year, as against 489 in 1961. The Infectious Sickness Rate for the year was therefore 2.1 as compared with 17.2 for the previous year. The decrease in the number of infectious diseases during the year was mainly due to the fact that 1961 was not a "measles year". The following table sets out the infectious diseases notified during 1962, as compared with those received during1961. 1961 1962 Measles 453 27 Pertussis 5 6 Scarlet Fever 5 2 Pneumonia 7 - Dysentery 2 5 Food Poisoning 3 3 Tuberculosis 13 15 Erysipelas - 1 Puerperal-Pyrexia - 1 Typhoid Fever 1 - 489 60 From the table set out above the following facts emerge:- -11- 1. Scarlet Fever notifications totalled only 2 in 1962, a drop of 3 on the 1961 figures. 2. Diphtheria It is now 7 years since the last case of diphtheria was notified in the District and 16 years since this was a cause of death. Outbreaks of diphtheria still occur from time to time in different parts of England and Wales but if we can succeed in keeping our immunisation rate at its present very high level we should certainly avoid any danger of such an outbreak in Friern Barnet. The fact that 94.2% of infants under 2 years of age are protected against diphtheria is very gratifying. The great majority of these immunisations are combined in the triple antigen giving protection against whooping cough and tetanus as well. 3. Measles notifications fell from 453 in 1961 to 27 this year. The type of infection was again very mild. 4. Pertussis notifications were 6 this year - 1 more than last year, but still a very satisfactory figure. Although it is difficult in any one District to show statistically the effect of whooping cough vaccination, recently published figures are of great interest. These show that for England and Wales in 1960 and 1961 the total deaths from whooping cough were 64, and of these 64 deaths only one occurred in a completely vaccinated child - a child aged 2 years who suffered from epilepsy. Although the death rate from pertussis is low it is such a distressing disease that every child should be protected from it so far as is possible. 5. The incidence of food poisoning and dysentery increased from a combined total of 5 in 1961 to 8 in 1962. All cases of dysentery and food poisoning, particularly Salmonellae-typhi-murium infections, are carefully investigated and are fully followed up wherever the source of infection may lie. Although the continued low incidence is very satisfactory, this rate is extremely variable and there is by no means any general reduction throughout the country in these infections. 6. No case of poliomyelitis was notified in 1962. The rate of polio immunisation for Friern Barnet children continues at a satisfactory high rate. As in previous years, we have co-operated with the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, in obtaining specimens from children who have not been in -12- known contact with poliomyelitis, so that their stools can be examined. 7. Fifteen cases of tuberculosis were notified during 1962, two more than during 1961. Four of these were from Friern Hospital. The Mass-Radiography Unit visited Friern Barnet during 1962. A total number of 1015 persons were X-rayed (530 men and 485 women). No abnormalities were found. 8. International certificate of vaccination. The number of certificates of successful vaccination or re-vaccination brought to the department for authentication by persons proceeding overseas was 1435. -13- SANITARY SERVICES.

Following a survey and report on the properties included in the second phase of The Avenue and East Road Redevelopment Plan two groups of houses comprising twenty-five dwellings which were considered to be unfit for habitation were declared to be clearance areas. -16- The houses involved were:- Area No. 1 5,6,7,10,11,14 and 16 Stanhope Road. Area No. 2. 2,3,20 and 21 Stanhope Road. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, Holmesdale Road. 9,10,13,15,16 and 18 Holmesdale Road. A compulsory purchase order was made in respect of these unfit dwellings and also the other properties in this phase of the redevelopment scheme which for the- most part are sub-standard. There were a number of objections to the compulsory purchase order and a Public Inquiry took place in October. The Order was later confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government modified to the extent that one of the houses (21 Stanhope Road) described by the Council as unfit for habitation was removed from this category. During the course of the year the rehousing of the occupiers of the dwellings in the first phase of this scheme was completed and the buildings have since been pulled down. As a result of other action taken by the department repairs were carried out to 140 dwellings where housing conditions were found to be unsatisfactory. Multi-occupation of houses. New powers enabling local authorities to require the provision of adequate facilities and to control the number of occupants in dwellings let in multiple occupation were contained in the Housing Act 1961 which came into operation in the latter part of that year. A preliminary investigation carried out during the year revealed nine cases of multi-occupation and suggested that the local problem was not serious. In two instances the letting off of premises to several families ceased following representations, in another instance a Direction -17- was made by the Council limiting the number of occupants, and in the others additional facilities were required to improve the standard of accommodation provided. Fresh cases of multi-occupation are, however, continually coming to light as a more detailed survey of the district proceeds and it is clear that much still remains to be done in this section of our housing work. Certificates of disrepair. Applications were received from the tenants of five dwellings for certificates of disrepair under the provisions of the Rent Act 1957 and these were dealt with as follows:- (1) Applications received 5 (2) Certificates:- (a) approved in respect of all defects 1 (b) approved in respect of some defects. 2 (c) refused 2 (3) Undertakings to remedy defects accepted. 1 (4) Certificates of disrepair issued 2 In addition two certificates of disrepair previously issued were revoked the defects having been remedied. Improvement grants. Although several enquiries were received concerning the financial assistance which is available to help owners of older properties to improve their houses and to provide essential facilities such as a bathroom, hot water supply, internal W.C. &c., where these are lacking, only five applications for grant were made, four of which were approved. By the end of the year the improvements had been completed at two of the properties. A circular which was received from the Minister of Housing and Local Government during the year referred to the need to secure a big increase in the numbers of older houses improved and suggested a systematic approach -18- to the problem by tackling it on an area or street basis with increased publicity and effort and, if necessary, the acquisition and improvement of suitable properties in such areas by the local authorities themselves. The Council considered a report on areas in Friern Barnet suitable for improvement in this way and have selected the Holly Park area as one in which special efforts should be made to stimulate interest in the scheme. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD. Food premises. There are 142 premises in Friern Barnet where food is either stored, prepared for sale, or sold, as follows:- Type. Number. Registered under Food and Drugs Act 1955• For sale of ice cream. For manufacture of sausages or preserved food. Bakers 9 1 - Butchers 13 - 9 Cafes and Restaurants 20 9 1 Confectioners 30 29 - Fishmongers 6 1 - Greengrocers 21 3 — Grocers 39 29 11 Milkshops 4 4 Total 142 76 20 There are also twelve food hawkers who carry on their trade from vehicles or stalls and who have been registered for this purpose under the provisions of the Middlesex County Council Act. -19- The premises, and all persons engaged in the handling of food, are subject to regulations and byelaws made under the Food and Drugs Act which provide control over the construction, repair and maintenance of the premises, the cleanliness of the apparatus and equipment used, and the hygienic handling of food. Five hundred and eighty-three visits were made in connection with these matters. It was not necessary to take legal proceedings to obtain the remedy of conditions which were found to require attention, but in one instance the condition of the premises made it virtually impossible to maintain a proper standard of food hygiene and the occupier decided to discontinue the business. Food inspection. There are no licensed slaughterhouses in the district and most of the local meat supply comes from the London and other nearby meat markets. Samples of meat offered for sale in butchers shops were submitted for bacteriological examination and without exception found to be satisfactory. Of the different foodstuffs examined at various shops and stores the following was found to be unfit for huuan consumption, surrendered and disposed of by incineration or burial at the Council's Sewage Works:- Beef 149 lbs. Pork 137 lbs. Veal 20 lbs. Liver 27 lbs. Fish 56 lbs. Flour 40 lbs. Tinned meat 31 tins Tinned fish 4 tins Tinned vegetables l4 tins Tinned fruit 101 tins Frozen fish 51 packets Frozen vegetables 8 packets Pastries 24 packets. Nine complaints were received which related either to the quality of food or to the presence of foreign material, These complaints were investigated in detail and discussed with the manufacturer or retailer of the foodstuff concerned with the purpose of ensuring that every possible precaution would be taken to prevent contamination of food in any form. -20- Milk Supply. The milk supplied to Friern Barnet residents is either pasteurised, sterilised or tuberculin-tested. The twenty registered distributors include the large dairy companies delivering milk daily and the occupiers of shops retailing small quantities of sterilised milk in association with some other business. There is one dairy in the district at which milk is pasteurised and bottled. Samples of the different grades of milk were taken regularly throughout the year. The one hundred and thirty-four samples which were submitted for examination were all found to be satisfactory. No complaints were received as to the quality of the milk supplied. There were, however, two complaints of dirty milk bottles and in both instances the investigations indicated that the bottles had been misused at some stage before being returned to the dairy company concerned. Ice cream. Seventy-six, or more than half of all food premises in the district are registered to sell ice cream. One person manufactures ice cream in accordance with the methods described in the Ice Cream (Heat Treatmant) Regulations. Generally, however, the ice cream is obtained from the nationally known manufacturers and sold in the wrapped or packed conditions as supplied to them so that handling is reduced to the minimum. Sixty-four samples of the different products offered for sale were submitted to examination by the Public Health Laboratory and all satisfied the standard test for bacteral cleanliness. SHOPS . There are some 313 shops in Friern Barnet. The Shops Act 1950 is administered by the Council and deals with such matters as hours of closing, the early closing day, Sunday trading, the employment of young persons, and the comfort and welfare of shop assistants. One hundred and thirty-one inspections were made in administering the various provisions of the Act. No serious defects or infringements were observed and those matters which needed attention were remedied without the necessity for formal action under the Act. -21- WATER SUPPLY. The water supply for the district is provided by the Lee Valley Water Company, except for that part of the South Ward which is supplied from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. All the houses in Friern Barnet have a piped internal supply. This supply has been adequate and the reports on samples shewed that it was of a high standard of bacterial purity and suitable for public supply purposes. The water is hard and has no plumbo-solvent action. AIR POLLUTION. The appointment of an assistant to undertake work primarily in connection with smoke control has enabled the local problem of air pollution by smoke to be tackled with greater energy. Our programme for establishing smoke control areas to include eventually the whole of the Friern Barnet district, which had seemed likely to take eighteen years to complete, was revised and accelerated to a new target of six years. Smoke Control Area No. 2 came into operation on the 1st. October 1962 and brought the number of dwellings in the district subject to smoke control to 1036. All the preliminary work in connection with Smoke Control Areas No. 3 and No. 4 was completed during the year, the Orders were made by the Council and later approved without modification by the Minister of Housing and Local Government. These Orders will come into force on the 1st. October 1963 and will bring a further 1429 dwellings under smoke control. The daily measurement of smoke and sulphur dioxide in the air was continued and the results forwarded to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research as part of the national survey of atmospheric pollution. A measuring station is maintained at the Town Hall and it is proposed to establish two more stations to sample the air in other parts of the district. -22- The results of this investigation were as follows Monthly averages of Smoke. (Microgrammes per cubic metre) Monthly Average. Highest daily reading.

Measurements were not being taken in this district during the comparable fog period of 1952 so direct comparisons cannot be made but the general indication is that the increase and consequent casualty rate were much less on this occasion, reflecting the benefit of smoke control. -23- FACTORIES. Factories. The Council's functions in regard to factories include the cleanliness, overcrowding, temperature, ventilation and drainage floors in respect of those in which mechanical power is not used. In the case of factories where mechanical power is used, i.e. the greater number, these duties are limited to securing adequate sanitary accommodation. The provision of the Factories Act 1961 relating to all other matters are administered by the factory inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour. There are seventy-five factories in the district, most of which are of the small and light industrial type. Inspection of factories. Premises. No. on Register. Inspections. Number of Written Notices.

The Factories Act requires occupiers of factories carrying out certain classes of work to send to the Council twice each year lists of the persons employed by them as outworkers. This information enables control to be exercised over work which might otherwise be carried out in unsatisfactory premises or in conditions likely to lead to the spread of infection. Notification was received of 60 outworkers who were engaged in the following occupations:- Making wearing apparel 34 Making artificial flowers 3 Box making 17 Brush making 3 Carding buttons 2 Making lampshades 1 It was not necessary to restrict outwork in any instance. -25- PEST CONTROL. The number of complaints received during the year which related to rats or mice was one hundred and sixteen. The actual number of rat infestations found as a result of these complaints and the routine inspection of the district for un-reported infest tions was seventytwo, the lowest for several years and less than half the number recorded last year. Two hundred and seventy-two premises were visited in the process of dealing with the infestations. So for as the infestations at private houses were concerned there was no charge to the occupiers except in respect of any structural or other works which were necessary to make good any damage caused by rats or to reduce the possibility of re-infestation. Charges, based on the labour and materials used, were made in respect of treatments carried out at business premises. Treatments of the district sewers were undertaken twice during the year. This is a routine control measure followed since 1947. 'The results suggested that the level of infestation was slightly less than in 1961. Fourteen premises were cleared of mice. Requests for advice and assistance to deal with insect pests such as ants, furniture beetles, moths, were as usual numerous, and forty-one wasps nests were destroyed. MISCELLANEOUS. Petroleum spirit and mixtures. Twenty-three licences were granted for the storage of a total quantity of 44,030 gallons of petroleum spirit or mixtures, of . hich 43,800 gallons were kept in underground tanks, each holding 500 gallons or more, and 230 gallons in smaller containers. The licences included conditions for the safe-keeping of petrol which conform to those recommended by the Home Office. A number of underground storage tanks were -26- tested under the- licence conditions relating to age of installation and three tanks ceased to be used for the storage of petrol during the. course of the year. These were water-filled as a safety measure. Ninety-one visits were made to the petroleum stores to ensure that the conditions attached to the licences were complied with. Local land charges registrations. Information was supplied in respect of 595 enquiries relating to properties in Friern Barnet. -27- TABLE 1.

December 17th. - Christmas Holiday arrangements for Collection of Laboratory Specimens. December 31st. - Winter Vomiting. It has been our consistent practice to keep general practitioners in touch with recent developments in the field of preventive medicine, so that integration can be achieved. This policy is continuing to show useful dividends. (b) Medical Examinations. During 1962, 33 medical examinations were carried out in respect of entrants to the Council's service. -35- 0 LIBRARY & (: 13 MAR 1968 V > %CAL#^
