To the Chairman and Members of the Crayford Urban District Council Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1958 which is prepared on the lines suggested by the Minister of Health. The Registrar-General's estimate of the mid year population for the Urban District is 30,280 compared with 29,980 in 1957. Generallyspeaking, on the basis of the statistical information available, the health of the Urban District was well maintained. The standardised death rate was 11.5 per thousand of the home population compared with 11.7 for the whole of England and Wales. The birth rate at 17.03 per thousand compares favourably with that for the country as a whole (16.4). Eight infants died during the first year of life giving an infant mortality rate of 14.7 per thousand live births, which is the lowest rate recorded in the District since 1954, when the rate was 10.1. The infant mortality rate for England and Wales was 22.6 per thousand. As in previous years, a substantial proportion of the deaths were associated with prematurity and congenital malformation, over which no significant degree of control is possible at present. Much research is, however, going on in regard to the possible influence of german measles and other virus illnesses as they affect the growing foetus during the early months of pregnancy. There were no maternal deaths due to childbirth. Deaths from tuberculosis numbered 3 as against 1 in 1957Deaths due to malignant disease, in general, showed a slight decrease over the previous year and cancer of the lung caused 13 deaths compared with 15 in 1957. Deaths attributed to coronary disease numbered 50 compared with 42 in 1957 and 45 in 1956. For the ninth year in succession there has not been a single case of diphtheria in the Urban District. There were no cases of poliomyelitis during the year. Twenty-one new cases of tuberculosis were notified during 1958 as against seventeen during the previous year. The year under review was a measles year and a considerable epidemic commenced in September and continued into the early summer of 1959. During 1958 267 cases were notified but only one case was treated in hospital. Infectious diseases throughout the ages have shown a rise and fall in incidence due to many and complicated factors which are not fully understood. This matter is, however, of great significance from the administrative point of view as well as from the standpoint of the health of the community. As a result of the provision of pure water supplies in the middle of the 19th century, the enteric and diarrhoeal diseases generally were largely overcome. Scarlet fever, which in the 19th century and early part of this century was one of the main killing diseases, is, nowadays, a disease of little importance. Smallpox has been largely overcome by stringent supervision at sea and air ports and 2. by the instrument of vaccination, although the possibility of an epidemic is always present, so that the greatest vigilance is necessary at all times. The last great epidemic of diphtheria occurred in the early 1930s and was thought to be due, largely, to an increase in the virulence of the diphtheria organism. The introduction of mass immunisation in the middle of the 1930s together with great improvements in environmental and personal hygiene have, practically, abolished this disease, although small outbreaks of virulent type do occur from time to time in different areas. The need to keep the level of immunisation of children at a high level has often been stressed. It is, of course, possible that any deterioration in environmental conditions resulting, for example, from war conditions or other calamity might bring all or any of these diseases back in an enhanced form. Nowadays the main hazard is due to the virus diseases, of which poliomyelitis is the best known example. There are reasonable grounds, however, for optimism that the mass immunisation of the young population may, before long, in some way alter the relationship between the virus and the human organism, but it is too early, yet, to say whether one can look forward with confidence to the early abolition of this disease. The antibiotics and chemo-therapeutic drugs have shorn measles of most of its terrors due, largely, to preventing the serious complications such as broncho-pneumonia, which was the main cause of death in years gone by. Much discussion is taking place at the present time as to whether the present system of notification of infectious diseases, which is founded, largely, on experience gained during the last half-century, does not need to be drastically overhauled. The notification of measles, which came into operation in 1940 when environmental conditions were seriously affected by the war, is regarded by many as being unnecessary at the present time in view of the fact that little, if any, action is taken following the receipt of notifications by general practitioners. The cost of this notification is quite considerable and there is no commensurate return from the health point of view. Scarlet fever is another disease the notification of which could, perhaps, temporarily be discontinued. It is hoped that in the future the whole position of notification of infectious disease will be rationalised in the light of present day needs. During the year poliomyelitis vaccination was vigorously carried out by the Local Health Authority and details of the numbers vaccinated are given on page 17 . During 1958. the Council decided, in principle, to implement the provisions of Section 11 of the Clean Air Act, 1956 relating to smoke control areas and a pilot survey was carried out with a view to obtaining reliable information as to the cost of replacing unsuitable appliances and adapting others to make them capable of burning smokeless fuels. 3. The area suggested for the first smoke control area is that part of Slade Green north-east of the railway line and contains 983 properties; 595 being Council dwellings, 346 private dwellings, 10 shops constructed by the Council, 26 other shop premises, and 6 Church buildings and schools. The Health Committee have been much exercised in the course of their deliberations by the lack of assurance that adequate supplies of smokeless fuels other than coke will be available and have not been too happy that, in the main, authorities will have to rely on coke as the main source of smokeless fuel for some years to come. At the time of writing, application has been made to the Minister of Housing and Local Government for preliminary approval of the Council's proposals for their No. 1 Smoke Control Area, In due course, arrangements will be made for the maximum amount of publicity to be given in the area concerned, so that no resident affected by this Order, which it is proposed will come into operation in the Autumn of I960, will be without all the information which he may require. Publicity measures will include public meetings, exhibitions and the distribution of explanatoryleaflets. In 1956, the South East London Mass Radiography Service issued a report on the operation of the service in a report entitled "No Time for Complacency" and, although no hard and fast conclusions could be dram from this in regard to the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis in this area, it was evident that a sufficient reservoir of infection was present to raise the question of the advisability of carrying out a concentrated mass radiography survey. The Councils of Crayford, Bexley and Erith have now appointed a joint committee to carry out such a survey in the Spring of 1960 and a great deal of preparatory work will be necessary in the Autumn of 1959. A house to house visitation will need to be made which may mean as many as 10,000 visits in the Urban District alone. Tuberculosis is a waning disease and it is hoped that this concentrated attack will contribute towards its final eradication. The work of the Bexley, Erith and Crayford Home Safety Committee continued during the year with steady propaganda in the interests of the reduction of accidents in the home. It is hoped that this work may be greatly increased in the future, although this would entail a larger expenditure than has been possible in the past. Both the Local Authority and the Local Health Authority have the power to make grants for this purpose. The Fabrics (Misdescription) Regulations of 1959 are to be welcomed in this connection in that they prescribe new standards of noninflammability for textile fabrics, to which the Fabrics (Misdescription) Act of 1913 applies, namely, textile fabrics to which is attributed the quality of non-inflammability or safety from fire, or any degree of that quality. The Act places the responsibility on the local authority, who have been considering how the stringent British Standards tests prescribed by the Regulations could best be carried out. It is likely that they are too complicated to be carried out in the Health Department and the Council are considering the possibility of submitting samples of fabrics to one or other of the testing houses, recommended by the Board of Trade, who would be prepared to undertake such work on behalf of local authorities. 4. The future of the health services in this area are closelylinked up with work of the Royal Commission on Local Government in the Greater London Area. The present separation, in the Urban District, of the environmental from the personal health services is an artificial one and I think one may look forward with some confidence to an improvement in the position in years to come. In conclusion I wish to thank the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their support and encouragement and the Chief Public Health Inspector, Chief Clerk and all members of the Health Department for the good work which they have done during the year. I am, Your obedient Servant, JOHN LANDON Medical Officer of Health 5.

The number of cases assisted was 13Â» including 7 new cases. Clothing, coal supplies and fares to visit relatives in Sanatoria had once again formed the bulk of the assistance given by the Committee. 19. The total result of the local Christmas Seals Sale, as reported by the Organiser to the Annual General Meeting, amounted to Â£94* 8s. 9d. The County Organiser, Health Visitor, Chest Physician and District Officer have given invaluable service to the Committee. WELFARE OF OLD PEOPLE This continued to provide an increasing demand on the services of the Health Department and the Crayford Old Peoples Welfare Committee. Many cases brought to the notice of the Department by the Committee Visitors and otherwise discovered, have been visited by the Medical Officer of Health and Chief Public Health Inspector. Arrangements have been made for entry into Old Peoples Homes where this has been possible. The Visiting Service carried out by the Crayford Old Peoples Welfare Committee continues to flourish. Help is given to the old folk with clothing and small home comforts. Many services have been rendered to elderly people and much assistance is given by other Voluntary Organisations to the Old Peoples Welfare Committee. Last offices have been carried out by Visitors. Close co-operation is maintained with the Kent County Council's District Officer, the National Assistance Board, the Women's Voluntary Service, the St. John Ambulance Brigade and Nursing Division and Red Cross. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 Under Section 50 of the Act, it is the duty of the local authority to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who has died in its area if it appears that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body can otherwise be made. During the year one body was dealt with by the Council under these provisions. 20. CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR'S REPORT To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year 1958 which gives a general summary of the work carried out by the Public Health Inspectors during the year. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD The inspection of food, as always, was very much to the fore. This important branch of Public Health work occupied its usual high quota of time spent by the Inspectors. In this connection a total of 684 inspections were carried out, 181 of which were to premises registered under Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955* The number of food premises in the area is as follows Bakers 4Â» Butchers 16; Grocers 58; Greengrocers 19} Confectioners 26; Fishmongers 8; Cafes, Canteens, etc., 34; Public Houses 19; Off Licences 3; Clubs 12; Other premises 24. Under Section 16 of the Food & Drugs Act, 1955Â» 58 premises are registered for the storage and sale of Ice Cream and 30 for the manufacture or preparation of preserved food intended for sale. Complaints The following complaints were received and dealt with during the jrear:- Salmon. Chicken & Turkey Cutlets. Complaint was made in respect to the condition of these cutlets which were alleged to be mouldy. Contact with the suppliers resulted in the immediate withdrawal from sale of the consignment. A warning letter was also sent expressing the serious concern of the Council for this incident. Milk. The advice of the Department was sought on the question of the quality of some milk. Samples submitted for examination, however, failed to indicate any abnormality in the quality or condition of the milk. 21. Bread. Two complaints of alleged foreign matter found in loaves of bread were received. In one case the "dark discolouration" complained of, under microscopical examination revealed only wheat structures, and therefore no further action was considered necessary. In the second case, the foreign matter was found to consist of a piece of cloth embedded in the loaf and, in this instance, legal proceedings were instituted resulting in a fine of Â£20 with Â£2. 2s. Od. costs awarded to the Council. Jam Tart. Small dark specks in a jam tart were alleged by a complainant to be cigarette ash. The report on the examination of the article stated that under the microscope the specks bore no resemblance to cigarette ash. Also in this particular case it was a little difficult to establish the fact that the specks had not got into the jam tart after sale. No further action, therefore, was considered necessary. Meat and Other Foods The following articles were found during the year to be unfit for human consumption:- lbs. ozs. lbs. ozs. Beef 81 8 Lard 7 8 Offal 66 0 Sugar 6 0 Chopped Pork 8 0 Margarine 14 8 Beef Chipolatas 2 8 Currants 5 0 Sausages 23 0 Tinned Sausages 6 10 Ham 83 15 Horseradish Relish 2 5 Corned Beef 108 12 Tinned Fruit 185 10 Frozen Rabbits 18 0 Tinned Fruit Juice 1 4 Chickens 203 0 Tinned Vegetables 715 1 Minced Beef Loaf 1 8 Tinned Snrrn 228 4 Luncheon Meat 35 2 Tinned Rice 2 15 Smoked Bacon 123 0 Tinned Meat & Gravy 1 15 Turkey Cutlets 17 0 Tinned Chicken 5 0 Chicken Cutlets 10 8 Tinned Spaghetti in Meat 98 0 Salmon Cutlets 12 0 Tinned Apricot Puddings 31 8 Jellied Veal 66 0 Tinned Beef Loaf 1 8 Dried Peas 13 8 Tinned Scotch Broth 2 0 Cocoa 24 4 Evaporated Milk 2 0 Self Raising Flour 12 0 Tinned Fish 58 4 The bulk of the food condemned was unfit for salvage and had to be destroyed, but where possible it is the practice to use condemned food for animal feeding. 22. Food Hygiene Regulations. 1955 We axe indeed fortunate that, on the whole, shopkeepers in this District have been very co-operative with regard to the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955. It is pleasing to note that many traders seek the Inspectors' advice when contemplating new or additional work to their premises. Consequently, no really serious breach of the Regulations has been observed. Generally speaking, local shops are well abreast of the times respecting the installation of refrigerated display cabinets and there appears to be an increase in the sale of frozen foods. As a result of regular visits to premises within the purview of the Regulations, 140 informal notices were served which represents a decided decrease on last year's figure of 196. These figures bear out the fact that such co-operation as previously mentioned is a distinct advantage. Slaughterhouses There are no slaughterhouses in the area. Milk Licences granted by the Council under the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1949/1953Â«- Supplementary - Tuberculin Tested ... 12 Pasteurised 13 Sterilised 14 Dealers - Tuberculin Tested ... 8 Pasteurised 12 Sterilised 29 25 samples of milk were submitted to the County Laboratory as follows:- Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised 8 Pasteurised ... ... ... 13 Sterilised 4 All satisfied the prescribed tests. 23. ICE CREAM (HEAT TREATMENT) REGULATIONS, 1947-1952 There are now no manufacturers of ice cream in the area. 38 samples of ice cream submitted for examination during the year were graded as follows:- Grade I 31 Grade II 8 Grade III _ Grade IV _ In two instances advice was sought where refrigerators had broken down, and arrangements for the proper disposal of stock was made.

CLEAN AIR ACT. 1956 A considerable amount of the Inspectors time was taken uj? with the initial survey for the proposed Smoke control Area at Slade Green. The information obtained has provided much food for thought and there is no doubt that a lot of hard work will be necessary, and the full co-operation of all concerned will be needed, in order that this problem can be successfully solved. As a member of the Thames-Side Joint Committee for the Abatement of Atmospheric Pollution, my Council brought into operation during the year volumetric apparatus for the detection of Sulphur Dioxide in the atmosphere, and it is hoped that the daily readings obtained will play some useful part in the overall picture in North West Kent.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water The Metropolitan Water Board is the supplying authority. The supply to the Crayford district is a mixture of water from Crayford, Dartford, Darenth, Wansunt and Wilmington wells. All the water is chlorinated on the works, but any excess remaining after a period of contact is removed completely before the water is passed into supply. Bacteriological analyses are carried out at least five times per week for all supplies both before and after chlorination. All new and repaired mains are chlorinated before being restored to use and samples of water from them are tested to see that the quality conforms with that normally supplied before the main is passed for service. None of the supplies is plumbo-solvent. Water Sampling The following samples were sent to the County Laboratory by the Council's Public Health Inspectors (a) Wells (drinking water), Bacteriological - 38 (b) Swimming Pool, Bacteriological - 9 (c) Domestic Supplies, Bacteriological - 13 All samples forwarded have been reported satisfactory with the exception of 17 samples taken after a well had been ascertained to be contaminated by flooding of the surrounding land. Notwithstanding, the fact that the pollution eventually cleared, it was decided by the owners to instal a chlorination plant as an additional safeguard. Water Supply Normal mains extension to serve new development was carried out. Drainage and Sewerage Normal sewerage extension to serve new housing development. Housing Plans The building of houses is in progress at Schemes Nos. 40 and 44Â» the former to comprise 226 dwellings, and the latter 30 Old Peoples' Dwellings with Community Room and Warden's Accommodation.
