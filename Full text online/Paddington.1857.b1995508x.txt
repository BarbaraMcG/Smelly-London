Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you the following Summary Statement, for the year 1857, of the Acts and Proceedings of the Sanitary Committee, and of the Vestry, so far as they relate to the Sanitary improvement of the Parish. The period reported on extends from the first of January, 1857, to Lady-Day, 1858, my former report having been presented to you at the close of the year 1856.

PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE ACT FOR THE BETTER LOCAL MANAGEMENT OF THE METROPOLIS. Between January 1, 1857, and March 25, 1858, 784 Notices of Orders were issued. In every case opportunity was given to the parties on whom the Orders were made, to show cause against their enforcement. Such cause was shewn in respect of 38 Orders for Drainage, issued under the 73rd Section of the Act, and was deemed by the Committee so far satisfactory as to justify them in sanctioning delay in the execution of the works. In all the remaining cases, with the exceptions stated below, the required improvements were voluntarily carried out. In respect of the Orders Nos. 386, 542, 1296 and 1297, the works have been executed by the Vestry in accordance with the provisions of the 73rd Section. In three of these cases the expenses have been recovered from the owners of the property by the Vestry, and in the fourth, proceedings for recovery are now in progress*. The following is an alphabetical list of the principal Streets and Places in respect of which sanitary works have been completed in execution of Orders under the Local Management Act, issued during the two years ending December, 31, 1857. *The expenses have since been paid. 5 TABLE I.

MISCELLANEOUS PROCEEDINGS. I. The Canal Basin. The efforts made during the preceding year to induce the Grand Junction Canal Company to improve the Canal Basin having proved abortive, it became my duty again, in conjunction with the surveyor, to draw attention to the subject. Special reports from the surveyor and myself were presented to the Sanitary Committee on the 21st of May, and referred to the Vestry, in consequence of which a deputation was appointed to confer with the Directors, and press upon them the necessity of carrying out such improvements as were recommended by the surveyor. The deputation attended the Board of Directors on the 28th of July, and were assured that the subject should be carefully considered, and the result communicated. A letter was accordingly received, dated July 30th, 1837, and presented to the Sanitary Committee at its next meeting, in which the Directors proposed to cleanse the Canal during the winter months, in so far as such cleansing could be effected by the use of hand-dredge; but declined to empty it, and remove the mud by spade, as suggested by the Committee. The process of hand dredging was in operation for several months last winter, during which period c "nUedaTledr Oo/wKMtantwTi^ of whom it * stated, that although in good health until vaccination, they have never been well since ; that 18 the surveyor was directed to report on its effects. His report being unfavourable, the Committee resolved on the 18th of March, 1858, again to communicate with the Canal Directors, and to repeat the expression of their conviction that no other means, except those before pointed out to them, would answer the purpose. The further steps to which this gave rise will fall within the scope of my next year's statement.* II. The Serpentine. On the 16th of July, I presented a report on the Serpentine, containing microscopical and chemical analyses of the water and of the mud at the bottom, and showing the dangers arising from its foul condition, and the advantages to be anticipated from the execution, as contemplated by Sir B. Hall, of works of improvement, similar to those which he has so admirably carried out in the lake in St. James's Park. At the direction of the Vestry I waited on Sir B. Hall on the subject, and at his request sent him a copy of the report. He expressed his intention of forwarding the improvements in question to the utmost of his power. *During the present Summer a second conference was held with the Directors, which was attended by Lord Ebrington and the Right Hon. Sir B. Hall, Members of Parliament for the Borough. The result was satisfactory in so far, that a promise was obtained that the Basin should be excavated by spade labour next Winter. 19 III. Houses in Westbourne Grove. On the 3rd of December, 1857,1 reported on the condition of certain Houses in Westbourne Grove, showing that the basements were from time to time overflowed with sewage water. It having appeared to the Committee from the oral reports of the surveyor that the nuisance arose from the insufficient outfall of the Ranelagh Sewer, and that the remedy lay in the execution of sewerage works within the province of the Metropolitan Board of Works, and which the Vestry had no power to execute—and it having further appeared that the Metropolitan Board had refused to undertake such works, it was resolved to recommend the Vestry to appoint a deputation to Lord Ebrington, requesting him to bring the subject before Parliament. In the mean time I waited on the Board of Works at its meeting, held on the 1st of January, 1858,with the sanction of the Committee, as part of a deputation from the residents who had suffered most from the nuisance above referred to. The subject was again taken into consideration by the Board, and on the motion of your representative, it was finally resolved to construct along the Uxbridge Road, from the Grand Junction Road to Albion Street, a Sewer of the required dimensions, at the expense of £ 6000.

In accordance with the provisions of the Metropolitan Markets Amendment Act, 1857, the annexed form of Notice was issued to all Occupiers of Slaughter Houses in the Parish. PARISH OF PADDINGTON. SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. Metropolis Local Management Act, Section 131. "Before any Licence for the use of any Place within any Parish "mentioned in either of the Schedules (A and B) to this Act as a Slaughter"house is granted by any Quarter Sessions of the Peace under the Provisions “of the Act of the Session holden in the fourteenth and fifteenth years of ''Her Majesty, Chapter Sixty-one (Metropolitan Market Act, 1851), one “month's previous notice of the intention to apply for such Licence shall be "given to the Vestry or District Board of the Parish or District in which "such place is situate, to the intent that such Vestry or District Board, if "they think fit, may shew cause against the grant of such Licence." You are hereby informed- 1. That if you intend to apply for the grant of the Licence above-mentioned, or for a renewal of the same, it will be necessary for you to give notice of such intention to the Vestry Clerk on or before Tuesday, the First of September next. 2. That the Vestry will shew cause against the grant of a Licence for the use of any Place within their Parish as a Slaughter- 21 house, respecting which it shall not have been certified to them by their Medical Officer:— a. That no part of the Building containing the Slaughter-house shall be used as an inhabited Dwelling, and that between every Window, Doorway or other opening of the same and every inhabited House, there intervenes an uncovered space of at least 10 feet in its longest measurement. b. That the Slaughter-house is provided with a sufficient supply of Water and with the necessary apparatus. c. That it is provided with properly-constructed impermeable Drainage communicating directly with the Sewer, and that the Inlet to the Drain is properly trapped and covered with a fixed grating, the bars of which are not more than three-eights of an inch apart. d. That a sufficient number of covered Receptacles are kept to contain all Manure, Garbage, Refuse and Blood. 3. That the Vestry will in future require of every person occupying any Slaughter-house within their Parish, that he shall punctually comply with the following recommendations for the regulation of such places:— a. That every Slaughter-house be on all occasions thoroughly washed and cleansed within three hours after the slaughtering and dressing of any Cattle. b. That all Blood, Manure and Refuse be removed from the premises on the night following the slaughtering of any Cattle, between the hours of 10 p.m. and 8 a.m., and that neither Blood nor Solid Refuse be on any account allowed to enter the Sewer. c. That no Cattle be kept in a Slaughter-house or Pound connected therewith for a longer period than 36 hours previously to their being slaughtered. d. That the Slaughter-house and all buildings connected therewith be lime-washed throughout their whole interior, at least three times in every year, namely—during March, June and September. 4. That the Yestry will under no circumstances consent to the Licensing of a Slaughter-house in any crowded or densely populated neighbourhood. Dated this day of August, 185 (By Order of the Vestry,) FREDERICK AVELING, Vestry Clerk. ounstliunon -wtitch may injuriuu»iy a ll cut mmm mmmmmm wmmmmmmmmmm wmm —mm p ■ ■ ■ ■ i vaccinated. One constantly meets with children of whom it is stated, that although in good health until vaccination, they have never been well since ; that 22 All the Slaughter-Houses, in respect of which notice was given of the intention to apply for a Licence, were inspected and reported upon. In accordance with the recommendations of that report the Vestry resolved to oppose the grant of the Licence in two cases only. In one of these cases the application was withdrawn; in the other, the Magistrates having personally inspected the premises, refused the Licence. V. Cow Sheds. On the 2nd of July, a detailed report was presented to the Committee on this subject, stating the number of premises occupied as Cow Sheds in the Parish, and giving details in each case, as to the health of the animals, and the dimensions, general condition, drainage, ventilation and cleanliness of the sheds or houses. The report further recommended certain regulations, which were finally adopted by the Vestry, in the form annexed. That every cow-house be well paved and properly sloped to the foot of the stalls, so as to lead into a channel with a sufficient fall towards a trapped gulley. That every cow-house be provided with a good trapped drain for the entrance of fluid matter only into the sewer. That every cow-house be furnished with an adequate supply of water. 23 That every cow-house be properly lighted and ventilated. That every yard adjoining a cow-house be well paved, and so sloped towards the channels and trapped gulley as to permit fluidrefuse quickly to escape into the sewer. That it be provided with a fit and proper dung-pit, so constructed as to prevent the escape of fluid from the dung into the adjoining part of the yard, neighbouring premises, or public ways. That the grain-bins and receptacles for wash be kept in repair, clean, and well covered. That every cow-house be thoroughly cleansed twice a-day, and the yards once a day. That all solid manure be carefully swept up and collected in the dung-pit twice a-day, and removed from the premises every morning before eight o'clock. (In the winter months, where fewer than five cows are kept, the manure may be retained till the second day.) That every cow-house be lime-whited at least four times a-year. Inhabited rooms over cow-houses are strongly objected to. It is considered that each cow requires, in order to supply it with sufficient air for its health, a cubic space of not less than 1000 feet. The use of deodorising materials is much recommended as subsidiary to other means of preventing nuisance. chapman, printer, paddington ~ uuiisiiiuiion which may injuriously uiiuuk w» .v, w. vaccinated. One constantly meets with children of whom it is stated, that although in good health until vaccination, they have never been well since ; that 24 reports on their condition as regards drainage, water supply, ventilation and other particulars, were presented to a special Vestry, held for the purpose of determining in what cases the granting of the License should be opposed. It having appeared that in eight cases the Slaughter Houses were in satisfactory condition, and that in 26 others, works of improvement had been executed by the occupiers, in compliance with the instructions of the Sanitary Committee, it was resolved in the remaining seven cases to show cause against the grant of the License. In six of these cases the grounds of complaint having been removed, or new Slaughter Houses provided, the opposition was withdrawn. In the single case opposed, the License was refused by the Court of Quarter Sessions. In laying before you this Report, I am fully sensible that in the discussion of many of the subjects to which I have called your attention, I have not only left much to be filled up or supplied at future opportunities, but many questions of great importance have been entirely omitted. Such for example, as the improvements desirable in the ventilation of Churches and other Public Buildings, the expedients to be adopted for the diminution of the nuisance arising from untrapped gullies, the amended arrangements required in certain cases, for the prompt removal of corpses, and many other similar topics. These have been passed over in the present Report, partly because it was impossible to render it more comprehensive, without at the same time extending it beyond due limits, and partly because I felt that many of these questions involve difficulties with which the experience of another year will I trust render me more capable of grappling.
