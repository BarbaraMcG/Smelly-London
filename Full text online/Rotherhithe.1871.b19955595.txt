(For particulars of Contract see page 8.) Messrs. Hallet, & Co., of Rotherhithe Street, Manufacturing Chemists, having required the Dust Contractor to remove the ashes and clinkers from their furnaces without payment, this the Contractor refused to do, upon the ground that such ashes and clinkers were trade refuse, Messrs. Hallet, in order to try the question obtained a summons against him at the Greenwich Police Court, upon the hearing of which, and alter mature consideration, the Magistrate gave his decision, that such ashes and clinkers were trade refuse, and dismissed the summons. Removal of Nuisances, Sanitary Measures &c. During the past year 292 Notices have been served in duplicate under the "Nuisances Removal Act," upon complaints made by the Medical Officer of Health and Inspector of Nuisances, 249 of which nuisances have been abated by the removal 16 of the cause of complaint, 37 by the re-instatement of defective drainage, and in 6 cases the houses have been closed as unfit for habitation. Several of the Inhabitants of houses and premises on Rotherhithe Wall, between the Platform Wharf and West Lane, having complained to the Vestry of a nuisance proceeding from a wharf there in the occupation of Mr. Peter Brown, in consequence of the unloading at the said Wharf, of a quantity of decomposed cuttings resembling leather, and other offensive animal matter. A summons under the "Nuisances Removal Act," was issued against Mr. P. Brown at the Greenwich Police Court, and after several hearings, and the inspection of the premises by the Magistrate, Mr. Brown undertook to make certain structural alterations to his premises and adopt other means in order to endeavour to abate the nuisance, which alterations have been carried out, and no further complaints have since been made by the inhabitants as to the nuisance. Slaughter House Licenses. Fourteen notices were received in September last from Butchers and others, of their intention to apply to the Special Sessions for licenses for their slaughter-houses, and they having been severally inspected by the Medical Officer of Health, were all duly licensed by the Magistrates in October, 1871. Cow Houses. Five Cow-houses in this Parish were licensed by the Magistrates in October last, they having also been previously inspected by the Medical Officer of Health. The Vestry having in August 1871, received communications from Dr. Buchanan and Dr. Seaton, of the Medical Department of the Privy Council, with reference to the order of the Lords of Her Majesty's Privy Council, dated 29th July, 1871, as to precautionary steps which they thought desirable should be taken, on account of the prevalence of Cholera in certain parts of continental Europe, and inviting the Vestry to appoint one of its members to meet the representatives of other, below bridge river side authorities in order to confer as to the best and most economical means of obtaining the efficient examination of Ships, Hospital accommodation, and adequate disinfection contemplated in the said order in council. After much consideration the vestry appointed Mr. John Bulmer as their delegate, to the committee of the representatives of the other below bridge river side authorities before mentioned; they also appointed a committee to take such steps as might be considered necessary for the preservation of the health of this Parish, and in case of need to give orders for the examination of Ships, obtaining Hospital accommodation, and providing means of disinfection &c throughout the Parish and River side. The Vestry likewise passed the following resolution, which was forwarded to the Medical Officer of the Privy Council, viz:— "RESOLVED that this Vestry consider that it is extremely essential that the "Local Government Board, should have a most efficient staff stationed at Gravesend, to "inspect Ships, and carry out all matters requisite for preventing disease being brought "further up the river, and that the expense, consequent upon the measures necessary 17 "to be taken for the prevention of Cholera, should be borne by the whole Metropolitan "area, or the country at large, also that so far as the Metropolis is concerned, this “ matter should be considered by the Metropolitan Board of Works." Mr. Bulmer attended several meetings of the joint committee of representatives, but it was not found necessary to take any further action in the matter. The Southwark and Vauxhall Water Works' Company, (in order to assist the Vestry in taking precautions to guard against the probable visitation of Cholera,) having offered as an auxiliary to the present water supply, to place stand pipes at their own expense, in all courts and alleys in this Parish, where imperfect storage of water is provided, such offer was accepted by the Vestry, and the company erected stand pipes in the following places, viz:—Gillham's Court, New Place, Staple's Rents, Clark's Orchard, Sernes Alley, Bell Court, Princes Place, Spread Eagle Court, Adams Gardens, Neptune Court, Hanover Street, Norfolk Place, Thetford Place, and Coburg Lane. The Kent Water Works' Company, having also offered to co-operate with the Vestry, in the adoption of preventative measures against Cholera, the Vestry applied to the company to ascertain if they would place stand pipes where required in the eastern division of this Parish, and the company thereupon placed such pipes as follows, viz:—St. Paul's Lane, Charlotte Row, and Baker's Rents. For further particulars as to sanitary matters, see the Medical Officer of Health's Annual Report hereto annexed (Appendix No. 1.)

APPENDIX No. I. ANNUAL REPORT 'OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. From 1st of April, 1871 to 31st March, 1872. The Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, Surrey. Gentlemen, The account I have to render vou of the condition of the Parish, so far as it respects my department of duty, for the year ending March 3l6t, 1872, is on the whole satisfactory. 20 As usual epidemic diseases have destroyed many lives, but the number is below the average of the last six years; the most destructive in this class of diseases has been Small Pox, which in two years caused fifty four deaths, it may be said to have commenced early in 1870, progressed slowly until January 1871, when it became active and occasioned thirty four deaths at the end of June of that year, and since that time has gradually subsided. The table below will show the mortality arising from some of the most important epidemic diseases during the last six years. Desease. 1867 1868 1869 1870 1871 1872 Deaths total.

Small Pox. In the first quarter seventeen death were registered, in the second two, in the third five, in the last quarter seven, making altogether thirty-one deaths in the year; two cases sent from other parishes should be deducted, which will make the number due to this Parish twenty-nine. It appeared that six persons had been Vaccinated, eleven had not been Vaccinated, and no reliable information could be obtained respecting the remaining fourteen. Scarlatina. Five deaths only have occured compared with twenty-one in 18701871, and one hundred and twenty-four in 1869-1870. The deaths from Measles, Whooping Cough, and Diarrhoea, do not exceed the average number. Diptheria has caused three deaths. Varicella. One death has been attributed to this disease, but as small-pox occurred in some children in the same family a few days afterwards, it was probably Small-Pox, but difficult to diagnose. 21 Disinfection. The Chamber erected by Messrs. Fraser, has been in active operation during the year, the persons for whose benefit it was chiefly intended, at first showed some repugnance to the presence of the Truck at the door of their houses,and a disinclination to allow their beds and clothing to be exposed to such a high temperature as was necessary; much of this feeling of opposition was soon allayed, and everything needful was done without having recourse to the power of the law. Some claims were made for alleged damage to articles, and in three cases, although the complaints did not appear well founded, it was considered expedient to satisfy the complainants to the amount of two pounds twelve shillings and six-pence, and this sum constitutes all the expense incurred by the Vestry, for the destruction of Bedding, Clothing, &c. during the year; the disinfection of rooms was not neglected, and it appeavs that in the course of the year one hundred and fourteen trucks of articles were placed in the chamber, and one hundred and sixteen rooms disinfected. The Census. In my former annual report to you, I did not make any allusion to the census which bad taken place on the night of April 1st, 1871, because my statement only referred to matters which had occured between the 1st of April, 1870, and 31st March, 1871; there was moreover a conviction in my mind that the number of the inhabitants of this Parish had been underrated, and time was required to explain the discrepancy. The number returned for the fixed population was 25,873, compared with 22,957 in 1861, showing an increase of 2,916, an addition was subsequently made of persons forming the floating population, consisting of seamen and others to the number of 1,211, and the enumerators ultimately computed that this Parish contained twentyseven thousand and eighty-four souls. It must be borne in mind that the floating population is variable as regards the seamen who enter the Surrey Commercial Docks, in April there are very few Ships there, but from May to November the number is considerable; so that throughout the year it is estimated that about twenty-five thousand seamen go in and out of the Docks in their respective ships; the floating class has hitherto been computed as forming two-thousand, and I think we shall be not far from correct, if we consider the inhabitants of Rotherhithe to amount to twenty-eight thousand, on which number I shall base my calculation of the rate of mortality and births. Births, Nine hundred and three births were registered, four hundred and fiftythree Males, and four hundred and fifty Females ; in the former year nine hundred 22 and thirty-nine births were recorded, the deficency will therefore be thirty-six; but the deaths have also diminished to the number of forty, and the excess of births over deaths will amount to three hundred and seventy-six. Births were registered as follows:— Births. From April 1, 1871, to June 30, 1871 211 ,, July 1, „ ,, September 30, 1871 218 „ October 1, ,, ,, December 31, 1871 208 ,, January 1, 1872, to March 31, 1872 266 903 Deaths. In the four quarters of the year there was registered the following number of deaths, and in the mortality tables annexed the name of the disease is given. Deaths. From April 1, 1871, to June 30, 1871, 137 „ July 1, ,, „ September 30, 1871 128 „ October 1, „ „ December 31, 1871 150 ,, January 1, 1872, to March 31, 1872 159 574 This does not accurately represent the number of deaths, inasmuch as Inquests were held on the bodies of sixteen persons who were not inhabitants of this Parish, and in the Infirmary attached to the Union, twenty-three persons died, who were sent from Bermondsey, six from St. Olave's, and two from St. John's Parish, making altogether forty-seven non-residents; by abstracting this number the deaths due to this Parish will be reduced to five hundred and twenty-seven, and compared with the two previous years the rate of mortality will be as follows:— No. of Deaths. Corrected Mortality. Per Thousand. From March 31, 1871, to April 1,1872 574 527 18.83 „ „ 31, 1870, to April 1, 1871 615 567 20.25 „ „ 31, 1869, to April 1, 1870 679 661 22.19 In respect of age an analysis of the five hundred and seventy-four deaths will show that it included two hundred and ninety-six Males, and two hundred and seventy eight Females:— 199 under two years of age. 42 between 2 and 5 years of age 26 „ 5 and 10 „ 30 „ 10 and 20 „ 28 „ 20 and 30 „ 42 „ 30 and 40 „ 46 „ 40 and 50 „ 23 59 „ 50 and 60 years of age. 55 „ 60 and 70 „ 36 „ 70 and 80 „ 10 „ 80 and 90 „ 1 „ 90 and 100 „ Diseases of the epidemic class caused ninety-nine deaths, diseases of the air passages one hundred and fifty-nine, and other diseases including those of the nervous and circulating system, inflammatory complaints, besides those already mentioned, tindiseases of children, and forty-six Inquests, contributed three hundred and six-teen deaths. A larger amount of sanitary work has been done during the year than heretofore in the same space of time, two hundred ninty-two notices were served to abate nuisances; resistance was offered in some cases, and summonses were issued to enforce the orders of the Vestry, which were attended with a successful result in every case. The process against Mr. Peter Brown, for causing a nuisance by unloading decomposed animal matter in the public street in Rotherhithe, and depositing it in a barge along side the Wharf in large quantities, occasioned much trouble by requiring several attendances at the Greenwich Police Court, and a visit of the Magistrate to Rotherhithe, in order to inspect the premises himself. The year did not pass away without complaints by the inhabitants of an insufficient quantity of water supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company, this was experienced in the summer months, but not so severely as on some former occasions. There were no complaints of the quantity or quality of the water from the part of the Parish supplied by the Kent Water Company. On inspecting the Cow-houses they were found in a fair condition, and it was satisfactory to notice that the license had been obtained for its legitimate purpose inasmuch as many stalls which had long been vacant, were now filled with good cattle. The Slaughter-houses have not increased in number, and no complaints could be made of their condition when they were inspected at the usual periods, and in September with reference to the renewal of the licenses. Very few of the Bakehouses in this Parish are underground, some are completelv detached from the houses, and others are connected with the premises by a passage some feet in length; at the time of inspection they were found tolerably well ventilated, and kept in fair condition. The Dusting aud Scavengers work have been done as well as on former occasions. My thanks are due to you and my colleagues, for the assistance rendered to me in the performance of my duties.
