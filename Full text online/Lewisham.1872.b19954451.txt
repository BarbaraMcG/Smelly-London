THE REPORT BY THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE LEWISHAM DISTRICT FOR THE YEAR 1872-3. PUBLISHED BY ORDER OF THE BOARD. Printed by W. H. CROCK FORD, JUN., BLACKHEATH ROAD, AND LEWISHAM. 1874. REPORT. The year 1872-3—being that in which the Census for 1871 was published—is one which seems more especially to invite retrospection; and this is the more essential in a District like Lewisham, the growth of which has been very rapid. The population of the Parish of Lewisham was 51.40 per cent. greater in 1861 than in 1851, and the increase from 1861 to 1871 was 60.14 per cent. The increase in the number of inhabited houses in the same periods was 44.78 and 61.46 respectively. In Penge, however, the increase has been far more rapid, the population having increased from 1169 in 1851 to 5015 in 1861, or 329 per cent., and to 13,202, or 163.25 per cent. in 1871. The increase in the number of houses has in Penge been in much the same proportion, but the population in proportion to the number of houses has been denser in Penge than in Lewisham throughout the whole period of both decades. The rateable value of the Parish of Lewisham has very nearly doubled between 1861 and 1871, and that of the Hamlet of Penge more than doubled in the same period; the rateable value of the District as a whole has also more than doubled in the same time. The following table* gives the population and number of inhabited houses as appears from the Census, and the rateable value according to the county rate, as adopted by the MetroPolitan Board of Works for the basis of apportionment of their charges.

The relative values, taken from the Valuation Lists and County Rate Basis of Metropolitan countieas issued by the Metropolitan Board in Deeember, 1872, are for the whole Metropolis £20,287,709, and for the Lrwisham district £107,639, or about one-fiftieth (2 per cent.) of the entire Metropolis. Out of the fifteen Districts formed under the Metropolis Management Art, in the Lewisham District in rateable value was the smallest but three, viz., Fulhum, Plumstead, and St. Olave's, Sonthwark; since that time the Lrwisham District, whilst maintaining its position in exerss of the three Districts mentioned, has outgrown the Districts of the Strand, Whitechapel, St. Giles's, Limehousc, St. Savopir's, and Holborn, and now stands sixth in importance as regards rateable value. The Lewisham District is also of greater rateable value than that of the majority of the twenty-three parishes in Schedule A. of the Act. Such being the growth in population and general importance of the District, a corresponding increase in the expenditure for the purposes of local management must necessarily be expected, and a comparison of the balance sheets of the Board year by year from its constitution show that the demands of the District have more than kept pace with its growth, but a large proportion of the expenditure of the present and several previous years has been laid out in permanent works, the cost of which has been defrayed out of money borrowed for the purpose, and the repayment will be thrown over terms of years. Thus, whilst the accounts for the year show a total expenditure of nearly £43,000, the sum received from rates is little more than £33,000, and, notwithstanding a greatly increased expenditure, the burdens upon the ratepayers for all local purposes under the jurisdiction of the Board have not been, on the average, heavier during the past few years than at any previous period since the constitution of the Board. Extracts as to the Lewisham District are appended to this Report. It will be seen that the figures quoted in the Report of the Medical Officer of Health are slightly inaccurate, they having been procured from the Registrars prior to (he publication of the Census. 5 A new item has fur the Inst two years appeared in the accounts of the Board, although not properly included in their expenditure, viz., the contribution of the District to the expenses of the School Hoard for London, and of the Elections of its members, amounting in the present year to £1704 15s. 8d. An important question—as affecting the finances of the Heard—was raised in the early part of the year by the South Eastern Railway Company; having regard to the great extent of land within this District for agricultural purposes, it was long recognized by the Board as a grievance to the occupiers of land that they should be charged under the General Purpose Rate to very heavy expenses incurred almost exclusively for the benefit of householder; the Hoard therefore resolved in May, 1870, under the advice of counsel, that they would exercise the provisions of the 159th section of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, as regarded expense of the following character, viz., dust collecting, road watering, kerbing, channelling, and paving footpaths, and general improvements of a permanent character, and that the money required for such purposes should be raised by rates, in which "land used as arable, meadow, or pasture ground only, or as woodlands, orchard, market-ganlen, hop, herb, flower, fruit, or nursery grouud," should be assessed in the proportion of one-fourth part only of its nett annual value; thus placing land so occupied on the same footing as with respect to sewerage expenses, and redressing the grievance complained of by the farmers and other occupiers of land in the District. The South Eastern Railway Company claim to be rated for their lines of railway on the lower scale, and at the Kent Quarter Sessions in April, 1872 they appealed against the rate; it was, however, confirmed, subject to a case for the opinion of the Court of Queen's Bench, and although the Company has not yet set the case down for hearing, the question raised has not been abandoned. The same Company has also raised a similar question as to their chargeability to the Lighting Rate, and the importance of the questions at issue will at once be apparent when it is recollected that the rateable value of the railways in the District is upwards of £50,000, or nearly one-fourth the value of the entire rateable property. 6 Beckenham Tongue of Land. Perhaps the greatest achievement of the Board during the year has been the introduction and passing of a Bill in Parliament for effecting the drainage of the Beckenham Tongue of Land through the sewers of this District, and securing an adequate contribution from the Parish of Beckenham towards the cost of the sewers. The Parish of Lewisham and Hamlet of Penge, constituting the Lewisham District, are severed from each other except at the extreme western boundary, near the Crystal Palace, by an intervening Tongue of Land within the Parish of Beckenham, not included in the Metropolis as defined by the Metropolis Management Acts. At the date of the constitution of the Board there were scarcely any sewers in the Hamlet, and such as there were only had an outfall into the Pool river, resulting in a serious nuisance as the number of inhabitants increased. The attention of the Board was early (1857) directed to the necessity for constructing a sewer to convey the sewerage from Penge to the Ravensbourne and Sydenham main sewer at Bell Green, Lower Sydenham, and an arrangement was at that time contemplated for giving the intervening part of Beckenham the benefit of the sewer, and levying a contribution from their Parish towards its cost. The Board were, however, prevented from constructing a sewer by the Metropolitan Board withholding their assent to the same, they being advised that the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, did not empower Vestries and District Boards to construct sewers beyond the limits of the Metropolis. In the same year (1857) the Metropolitan Board had under consideration a Bill for amending, in numerous particulars, the Metropolis Management Act, and this Board hoped to overcome the difficulty they were met with by the insertion in such Bill of a clause for includiug in the Lewisham District the intervening part of Beckenham, and making it—for all the purposes of the Act—part of the Hamlet of Penge. This course was, however, disapproved by the Metropolitan Board; but they introduced at the instance of this Board, a clause (Sec. 58) in the Bill which became law as the "Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 7 1862, enabling Vestries and District Boards to carry any sewers or work beyond the limits of the Metropolis, subject, however, to the consent of the Vestry of the Parish or place through which the work was to paw, but giving an appeal to tho Secretary of State if the consent were withheld. At this time (1862) the Board had for several years been engaged in defending an action brought against them by Mr. Cator, the owner of the greater part of the intervening land in Beckenham, for contaminating the Pool river with sewage; in which action an appeal to the House of Lords was then pending. Mr. Cator's agent opposed to the utmost the construction of the sewer as proposed, and the consent thereto of the Vestry of . Beckenham was consequently withheld; but, on an appeal to the Secretary of State, an order was made by him for its construction. The Board availed themselves of this circumstance to bring about a compromise of the long pending litigation with Mr. Cator, by the terms of which each Party paid their own costs; the sewer was slightly diverted from the line originally intended in order to suit Mr. Cator's views, and he waived all claim to compensation for injury as owner of the estate through which the sewer was to be laid. The sewer was commenced in May, 1864, and completed in April, 1866, the total coat, including all incidental expenses, being £5580 6s. 7d. The Hamlet of Penge was thus connected with the Metropolitan sewerage system, but the evils resulting from a part of Beckenham, out of the Metropolis, intervening between Penge and Lewisham within it, were by no means removed; for the sewer was required by the Metropolitan Board to be maintained for the exclusive use of the Lewisham District, and the rapid increase of buildings on the Tongue of Land, all of which drained into the Pool river, soon revived the nuisance, which year by year became more intolerable. Memorials were again and again presented by this Board to the Metropolitan Board, urging them to obtain powers to include the Tongue of Land in the Metropolis, and thus enable it to be drained into the sewer which had been constructed and would answer the purpose—but all without avail. Applications of a similar character were also made to the Metropolitan Board from several other outlying districts, urging them to permit the drainage into the Metropolitan sewerage system of parts of parishes beyond the Metropolitan boundary, and the general question was fully considered by the Board, but their Engineer reported against the admission of any ex-Metropolitan parishes except Hornsey and Beckenham. Still, however, nothing was done to admit either. In the year 1869 the nuisance had grown so intolerable that this Board, in self defence, were constrained, as a temporary measure, to permit the drainage of a large number of houses on the Beckenham Tongue to be connected with their sewer, and entered into agreements with two public companies, owners of estates, for such purpose. This concession almost wholly abated the nuisance, but an appeal having been made by the inhabitants to the Secretary of State, he directed an Inquiry to be instituted into the subject under powers then Tested in him for the pnq>ose. The Inquiry was held at the Penge Parochial Offices on the 28th February, 1870, when it was proposed that the Tongue of Land should be formed into a Special Drainage District under the Sewage Utilization Acts and, subject to the approval of the Metropolitan Board, that an agreement should be entered into between the Vestry of Beckenham and this Board, by which the area in question should be drained into the Board's sewers,the Parish of Beckenham being charged a fair proportion of the cost of their construction and maintenance. The general terms were approved by this Board and also by the Vestry of Beckenham, but when the details of the arrangement came to be considered, difficulties in negociation arose, and the Metropolitan Board required that the proposed agreement should have the sanction of Parliament. In the mean time the necessity for some comprehensive scheme of drainage for the whole Parish of Beckenham had been urged by many of its inhabitants, and an Engineer had been consulted, who projected a scheme by which the greater portion of the parish was to be drained by means of sewage farms and the Tongue of Land to be connected with the Metropolitan system of sewers. The scheme was accepted by the Beckenham Vestry, and the necessary parliamentary notices were issued accordingly in November, 1870, and a Bill prepared for introduction into Parliament in the then next session for effecting the twofold 9 object in view; hot in the following February (1871) the Bill was abruptly withdrawn by direction of the Vestry, without notice to the Board or any explanation, either then or at any subsequent time. The Board at once resolved to urge upon the Secretary of State the necessity for re-opening the Inquiry, but on the faith of representations made on behalf of the Beckenham Vestry that the withdrawal of the Bill was due to objections to its general, rather than special object, and that there was still a sincere desire on the part of the parish authorities to carry the proposed arrangement with this Board into effect, negociations were reopened with the Vestry with that object. In the session of 1870-l, however, the jurisdiction under which the Secretary of State had acted was, by "The Local Government Board Act, 1871," transferred to the poor Law Board, under the name of the Local Government Board, and by the delays and difficulties consequent upon such change of jurisdiction, the Board were prevented from applying to Parliament in the session of 1871-2. In that session "The Public Health Act, 1872," was passed, by which the authority of the Beckenham Vestry under the Sewage Utilization Acts was taken from them and vested in the Guardians of the Bromley Union as the rural sanitary authority. The Board, however, were determined not to lose the opportunity of another session of Parliament in putting an end to the gratuitous use by Beckenham of their sewers; and immediately on the Public Health Act being passed, they resumed with the Bromley Guardians the negociations which had been carried on with the Vestry, and notwithstanding urgent appeals by the Guardians for delay, the Board removed all doubt which might have existed as to their intentions by passing a resolution on the 7th November, 1872, that all sewers and drains in the Parish of Beckenham flowing into sewers vested in the Board should be disconnected therefrom on the loth of the same month, unless in the meantime the terms of arrangement then recently proposed were accepted, or some counter proposal were made by the Guardians in the spirit of such arrangement, and the necessary preliminary steps were taken for an application to Parliament to sanction the same. Under this pressure the Guardians consented to concur with 10 the Board in introducing a Bill in Parliament for effecting the object desired, and the necessary parliamentary notices were published for such purpose. No sooner, however, was this done than the objection was started by the Guardians that they were not authorized to make such an application to Parliament, and in the event of the Bill not passing they might be rendered personally liable for the costa incurred, they therefore withdrew themselves as promoters of the Bill, and not only so, but most strenuously opposed it before the Committee of each House of Parliament. The present report being in respect of the year ending Ladyday, 1873, this subject cannot be continued without anticipation and trenching upon the proceedings of the year 1878-4. It is, however, unnecessary to go into particulars of the hardly fought battle between the Board and the Guardians over all the more important clauses of the Bill—first in the Lords, and afterwards in the Commons—but it will be sufficient to record that the Beckenham Sewerage Act, 1873, provides as an equivalent for the advantage of participation by the Beckenham Tongue of Land on the Metropolitan Sewerage System, for the payment of the following sums and continuing charges:— To the Lewisham Board, £1062 10s. on the 25th of March, 1874, and a yearly sum equal to one half-penny in the pound on the rateable value of the Tongue of Land called in the Act the Beckenham Sewerage Area. To the Metropolitan Board, £2312 10s. on the 25th of March, 1874, of which sum £1062 10s. is divisible between the Parishes who contributed to the cost of construction of the Ravensbourne and Sydenham Sewer, the apportioned part of such amount receivable by Lewisham being £618 6s. 2d. And yearly sums to provide for the interest and sinking fund of money borrowed for main drainage purposes, and also to provide for the maintenance of the main drainage system, proportioned to the rateable value of the area to the metropolis. The Board have, by formal resolution, tendered their thanks to James Richard Lloyd, Esq., the representative of the Plumstead and Lewisham Districts, at the Metropolitan Board, for the valuable services rendered by him in the very protracted negociations—not only between this Board and the Metropolitan Board— 11 but also between this Board and the Bromley Guardians, on the subject, as well prior to the introduction of the Bill, as, during its passage through the Houses; and they feel that the present report would be incomplete unlaw it contained a recognition of such services. It was contended by the opponents of this Bill, that the Penge and Bell Green sewer was faulty in its contraction, and insufficient for the drainage of the additional area proposed to be connected with it; but the sewer had, in fact, for three years, received all the sewage of the area included under the Bill, and, as regarded any insufficiency in construction, this Board consented to introduce a clause in the Bill, binding them to put the sewer into an efficient state of repair before the 25th of March, 1874, and so to maintain it. Lewisham Bridge. A great improvement has also been accomplished in the present year in tho re-building of Lewisham bridge, and the Hoard do not the less regard this as practically their work, because it is a County-bridge, and has been re-built under the order of the General Sessions of the County of Kent. So long ago as 1864, drawings for a new bridge were prepared under the direction and at the expense of the Board, and submitted by them to the General Sessions of the County, but, although they approved the proposed work, they offered only £100 towards an estimated outlay of £2,400, and the proposal to re-build the bridge was for a time abandoned. In order in some measure to mitigate the danger and inconvenience of the old bridge, the Board shortly afterwards removed the raised footpath which was on one side only, making the whole width of the bridge available for carriages, and constructed a temporary wooden footpath outside the southern wall of the old bridge. The danger and inconvenience of the old bridge increasing year by year, the Board, at the close of 1870, recurred to the subject, and having prepared plans for a modified improvement of the bridge, estimated to cost £800, again memorialized the Sessions on the subject, and an order was made by the Court in June, 1871, authorising the Board to widen and improve the 12 bridge in the manner proposed, and agreeing to contribute £200 towards the cost. It being optional with the Sessions whether they would or not rebuild the bridge, the Board were prepared to accept this offer if they could succeed in obtaining a material contribution from the Metropolitan Board, and an application was made to them accordingly; but they regarded the rebuilding of the bridge as a County liability, and while they fully recognized the necessity for the work, were advised that it was one which they were not authorised to carry out, and declined to contribute towards it. The Board were not, however, deterred by this decision, but again, in Octobcr, 1871, memorialized the Sessions, and on this occasion were supported by a memorial from the Plumstead Board of Works and by the advocacy of Mr. Lloyd, as the representative of the two districts at the Metropolitan Bonrd of Works. This, the third, application was successful, a resolution bring passed, on the motion of the noble Chairman (Lord Romney), that the County Surveyor should be instructed to prepare plans and estimates in the usual way and take steps for the rebuilding of tho bridge. Appended to this report are copies of the memorials of this Board and also of the Plumstead Board. The bridge was commenced in August, 1872, and completed in March, 1873. Ladywell Lane. The improvement in this road, between the High Street of Lewisham and the Ladywell Railway Station, by which a dangerously narrow winding road, in some places not 15 feet in width, was straightened and widened to forty feet throughout, was effected by the purchase of a strip of the Vicarage premises on the north side and the purchase of the Brockley Cottages (subsequently resold), less the gardens, and a strip of Church Meadow on the south side. The improvement was completed during the present year by the payment to this Board by the Metropolitan Board of £850 as their contribution to the cost of the work. Sydenham Green. This picturesque open space has been so long enjoyed by the public that the inhabitants have with great difficulty been in- 13 duced to believe it to have been private property for upwards of half a century, and that the exorcise of such rights over it might have been claimed at any time within such period. The neighbourhood has of late years so rapidly urhanised as to have given such right a considerable value, and it has been recently proposed to enclose the whole of the ground, ignoring any public right over the footpath which has immemorially existed along the boundary of the old enclosure. This, however, the Board arc prepared to maintain; and, although, upon high legal authority, they regard it as altogether impracticable to continue the open space in its former state, they have been engaged in very protracted negotiations with the owner of the Estate and the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Company, by which they still hope to ensure a great public improvement. West Hill. Along the same line of road the Board have determined to make another improvement, and remove a source of considerable danger by lowering a sudden rise in this hill; Other minor road improvements have been effected during the year, and a very considerable addition to the comfort of the inhabitants in the extensive work of kerbing and channelling footpaths and laying down asphalte and tar pavements, full details of which are contained in the annexed report of the Highways Surveyor. While zealous in effecting improvements in this District, and in obtaining a fair contribution from the Metropolitan Board towards the cost of carrying them out, this Board have yet felt it their duty jealously to watch the gigantic schemes for Metropolitan improvement which have been promoted by the Metropolitan Board, and in particular to oppose to the utmost the Metropolitan Street Improvement Bill, introduced in the Session of 1872, by which an estimated outlay of £2,000,000 was to be incurred. The Board acted in concert with the Vestries of St. Pancras, Camberwcll, and Islington, and the District Board of Fulham, in opposing the Bill, which was also opposed by other Vestries and District Boards, but without success. 14 Sanitary. A measure of the highest importance, in a sanitary point of view, has received the sanction of the Legislature during the present year, in the Act for preventing the adulteration of food, drink, and drugs. This Act makes it incumbent upon all Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards to appoint public analysts to analyse all articles of food, drink, and drags, on the request of any parishioners, for a fee not exceeding ten shillings; nnd imposes the duty on the Vestries and Boards through their Inspectors of Nuisances, of procuring and submitting for analysis samples of articles of food, or drink, and drags suspected to be adulterated, and on the articles being certified as adulterated, of proceeding before a magistrate against the party selling or adulterating. The Board, in January, 1873, appointed Charles Heisch, Esq., F.C.S., Professor of Chemistry in the Medical College of the Middlesex Hospital, as the analyst for the District, and although his services have not yet been greatly called into requisition, the Board can already testify to the beneficial operation of the Act, and anticipate great advantage from it hereafter. The mortality for the year 1872 has been favourable, the number of deaths being 27 less than in the previous year, notwithstanding the continuing increase of population. And the death rate, stated by the Medical Officer to be 14.84 per 1000 of inhabitants is not only lower than the average annual death rate, from 1861 to 1870, in any of the Registrar General's districts and sub-districts within the Metropolis and City Police District, but is also lower than the average rate in Lewisham for the same period. The following is a summary of the Table (IX.) in the Medical Officer's Report showing the classes of disease causing the deaths which occurred in the year, and the ages at which they took place:— 15 Classes of Disease. Ages at Death. Total. Under 1 year. Under 5. Under 10. Under 20. 20 and under 40. 40 and under 60. 60 and under 80. 80 and upwards. 1. Zymotic 65 60 19 10 0 6 5 1 175 2. . Constitutional 14 12 6 9 53 34 20 3 150 3. Local 69 24 0 7 28 65 80 0 300 4. Developmental . 55 26 1 — 6 2 26 10 133 5. Deaths by violence 14 2 2 1 6 3 1 2 30 Total 217 124 36 27 100 110 140 34 788 Whilst this table shows that nearly one fourth of the total number of deaths arise from zymotic or preventable diseases, it appears that out of the total number 144 occurred in children under 10 years of age. The large proportion of the total mortality occurring in children under one year appears to afford startling evidence of the necessity for the recent Act for the preservation of infant lift. The Board's hospital, in Hither Green Lane, the Medical Officer reports as continuing to be of essential service in preventing the spread of epidemic disease; 18 cases were admitted during the year, and only one died. The annual cost of the hospital is about £250. During the present year a new ward has been erected, and some general repairs carried out. The attention of the Board was called in June to the condition of the burial ground of Christ Church, Forest Hill, as being prejudicial to the health of the surrounding inhabitants, and the Medical Officer having confirmed such opinion, the Secretary of State has, upon the application of this Board, caused an official inquiry to be made into the subject, and it is hoped that an order of Privy Council will be issued either wholly preventing further 16 burials in the ground, or imposing such restrictions as will prevent any ill consequences. The Board have also, in conjunction with inhabitants of Croydon, successfully opposed the formation, as a commercial speculation, of a Cemetery near South Penge. Lighting. A material addition has been made daring the year to the number of public lamps iu the district, and, notwithstanding the comparative isolation of Southend, arrangements have been effected for lighting it with gas. The yearly increase of lamps has been accomplished as regards Lewisham, not only without rendering it necessary to increase the lighting rate, but for the year 1872 the rate has been reduced to threepence in the pound; it is more than probable, however, that the rate will return to fourpence another year. In Penge, the lighting rate is threepence in the pound. Sewerage. In the course of the present year, the sewer which was several years since constructed from the Ravensbonroe and Sydenham main sewer at Bell Green, as far as the Dolphin P. H., Lower Sydenham, has been extended from that point along the Lower Sydenham road, crossing under the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway, near the Sydenham station, to the top of West Hill, being a total length of 6057 feet; of which 4500 is of brick 3 feet by 2 feet, and 1551 of stoneware pipe 18 inches in diameter. The cost of the sewer was £3287 ; other minor sewerage works have also been constructed and are in contemplation, of which particulars arc given in the report of the Sewers Surveyor. Appended to this report are the usual annual statements of account, the annual report of the Medical Officer of Health, and a report by each of the Surveyors of the works executed under their supervision respectively. By order, SAML. EDWARDS, Cleric to the Board. 17 " To the Jiuticts of the Peace for the County of Kent constituting the " Annual General Session of the Peace, to be holden in and for the " County on the 24th October, 1871." THE MEMORIAL OF THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR TUB LkWISHAM district. " Sheweth—That early in tho present year your Memorialists " applied to tho General Session of the Peace to contribute towards " the cxp<-nso of widening and improving Lcwisham Bridge, in 11 accordance with piant and drawings which had been submitted to " and approved by the County Surveyor, the estimated cost of the " proposed works being £800. " At tho Annual General Session of the Peace holden on the " 22nd June last, It was Ordered, on the Presentment of a Grand 41 Jury of the insufficiency and inconveniency of the Bridge, that " your Memorialists should bo authorised to widen and improve the " same in tho manner proposed, and at tho cost estimated, and that " tho Court should contribute £200 towards the expense of the " same. « • " That application was, about the same time, made by your " Memorialists to the Metropolitan Board of Works to contribute " one-half tho estimated cost of tho proposed works out of the funds " at their disposal for the purpose of Metropolitan Improvements, " and, in reply, your Memorialists were informed that the Metro" politan Board had carefully considered tho application, and having " iu the course of their enquiries visited the Bridge, were greatly " impressed with tho noccvuty for the improvement proposed, but it " appearing that the Bridge was a Country Bridge, they were " advised they had no power to contribute towurds the cost of " widening and improving tho same, and that thus they had no " alternative in tho matter; and convinccd as they were of the value " of tho proposed improvement, it was with regret they arrived at " the conclusion that they were unuble to comply with the request " of your Memorialists. " Your Memorialists are also advised that the inability of the " Metropolitan Board of Works to contribute towards the cost ot " improving County Bridges applies equally to District Boards of " Works, and that the Statute uuder which they are constituted " clearly withholds County Bridges from their jurisdiction. Your " Memorialists are therefore uuder the necessity of abandoning their 18 " intention of widening and improving the Bridge in tho manner " proposed. " The General Session of the Peace being thus tho only autho" rity empowered to alter and improve the Lewi-ham Bridge, your " Memorialists submit that they should assume the exclusive re" sponsibility of improving or rebuilding tho same. "As evidence of tho inadequacy of the Bridge to the very " large and increasing trnffic on tho road, your Memorialists beg to " call attention to tho following facts :— " 1. The Bridge is only twenty-two feet six inches in width " between the parapet walls, including tho footpath " which it had on one Bide only; and it has a steep " ascent over it, tho inclination being one in twenty. "2. Such was the danger and inconvinience thus occasioned " to the public that your Memorialists, some years since, " caused tho entire width of tho Bridge to be made a " carriage-way, and had a temporary wooden footway " across tho river constructed on ono side of it for the '1 safety and convenience of foot passengers. " 3. The traffic having on two recent occasions been taken " by officers employed for tho purposo, was ascertained " to be about 1,460 vehicles, and 6,400 foot passengers "within tho twelve hours of each day; nearly 200 " vehicles and about 700 foot passengers occasionally " passing over the bridge in a single hour. " 4. The danger necessarily consequent upon so narrow and " steep a bridge and such heavy traffic is rendered still " greater by a railway bridge passing over the road " close to it. " With reference to tho claim of the inhabitants of Lewisham " and the adjoining Parishes upon the County llate for the required " expenditure, your Memorialists beg to remind the Court of General " Session: " 1. That the Bridge is one of the two old main—New Cross " Turnpike—roads connecting the County with the " the Metropolis, and that by the turnpike abolition " such roads, of which six miles are in the Parish of " Lewisham, are maintained at the sole cost of the " Parishes through which they pass, in relief of the " inhabitants of the County using the same. 19 " 2. That the assessment of tho Metropolitan Parishes in " the County of Kent greatly exceeds one fourth of the " assessment of tho entire County, and that thus the " Metropolitan Parishes—of which Lewisham is the " largest and most wealthy—hare for many years eon" tributed, and will continue to contribute a very large " proportion of the annual cost of repoiriug and improving County Bridge*, of which no portion (except in " ordinary repairs) has been expended in the Parish of " lewisham within tho memory of man. " Your Memorialists therefore request the Court of " General Session of tho Peace to exercise with " respect to the Lewisham Bridge, the powers " specially rested in them for improving and " rebuilding County Bridges, the inadequacy " and inconvenicncy of which shall have been 11 established by the presentment of a Grand " Jury of tho County. " And that the Court will order the widening " and improving or the rebuilding of the Bridge, " and defray the cost of the snmo out of the " County Bate. " The Common Seal of the Board was hereunto " affixed by Order made on the 18th of " October, 1871, in the presence of " Saml. Edwards. " Clerk to the Hoard." <" To the Jus tiers of the Peace for the County of Kent constituting the " Annual General Session of the Peace, to be holden in and for the " County on the 21 th October, 1871." tdk memorial of the board of works for thkplcmstead district, " Shewetu,—That your Memorialists are desirous to support the " prayer of the Memorial of the Lewisham Board of Works with " reference to tho improvement or re-building of Lewisham Bridge. " The inability of the Metropolitan Board of Works, or oi any 20 " District Board to contribute towards the cost of improving County | " Bridges, is clearly stated in the Memorial of the Lewisham Board. ] " The statistics given in the Lewishnm Memorial also show how " utterly inadequate the present bridge is for the duo accommoda- " tion of the great and yearly increasing traffic over it, and that " from the narrowness of the bridge itself and from tho steepness of " the asccnt thereto, the public arc daily exposed to much incon" venicnce and danger. " Although the bridge in question is within the limits of the " Parish of Lewisham, yet it so closely adjoins the Plumstead Din" trict that the inhabitants of the Parishes composing that district " arc almost equally concerned with those of Lewisham in having " it put into safe and convenient condition. In- addition to thin " they have a deep interest in the matter from the fact that the " expense of maintaining nearly nine miles of main roads in the " Plumstead District, formerly under the control of the New Cross " Turnpike Trust, is, and must be henceforward, borne solely by " the parishes through which they pass. " In conclusion your Memorialists would most strongly urge " attention to the fact stated in the Lewisham Memorial, that the " Assessment of the Metropolitan Parishes in the County of Kent is " much more than one-fourth of the Assessment of the entire " County, and that therefore the district contributes largely towards " the annual cost of repairing and improving the County Bridges, " and yet for very many years has not derived any benefit from its " contributions beyond the small suras required for ordinary repairs. " Your Memorialists therefore submit that a case exists justly " calling for an application of a portion of the County " Rate, sufficient to defray the cost of improving or re" building Lewisham Bridge; and they trust that the " Court of General Session of the Peace of the County of " Kent will be pleased to issue an order for the carrying " out of the necessary works in accordance therewith. " By order of the Board of Works for the Plumstead District. " Jas. Murray Dale, Clerk." " 20th October, 1871. THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE LEWISHAM DISTRICT.

ANNUAL REPORT TO The Board of Works For the Fewisham District FOR THE YEAR 1872, BY F. EACHUS WILKINSON, M.D., &c. Medical officer of Health for District. Gentlemen, As provided by the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1862 (25 and 26 Vict., cap. 102), I have again the honour of laying before you a report of the estimated population, together with the births and deaths registered in the Lewishum District during the year 1872. In Table I. (sec p. 6), I have given the enumerated population at the three decenniad*, 1851, 1861, and 1871. I he estimated population for the year 1872, obtained by ascertaining from the rate book* the number of inhabited houses at as near the middle of the year as possible, and calculating the same number of persons per house as were found to bo resident when the census of 1871 was taken. The number of inhabited houses at the censuses of 1851, 1861, and 1871, with the average number of persons per house at these periods. The average mortality per 1000, assuming a population obtained as above mentioned. Table II. gives the mortality in the Metropolitan and City Police District* from the Registrar General's summary. Table III., the mortality of the Suburbs of London. Table IV., the mortality of 20 cities and towns of the united kingdom. Table V., the causes of and ages at death in the Lewisham District. Table VI., the number of deaths which have taken place from certain epidemic diseases during the last 14 years. Table VII., the births and deaths in the each of the Registrar General's divisions of the Lewisham District. Table VIII., the quality of the Water Supply of this and other Metropo itan Districts, from Dr. Frankland's analysis.

In the 10 years, 1861-70, the annual rate was 23.6; in 1871 it was 23.7. "The outer ring includes 11 entire Registrar's districts with parts of 5 districts, or 11 entire sub-districts, where the mean density of population is expressed by 1.8 persons per acre, and the mortality was at the rate of 17.5 in 1872, against 19.3 in the 10 years, 1861-70, and 19 0 in 1871. "The population of the Lewisham Parish was at the rate of 5 person* per acre. " The mortality of Registration London, at the rate of 24.3 per 1000 during the 10 years, was one-fourth higher than the mortality in the outer ring; the difference in the annual deaths was 5 deaths in 1000 living. In 1872 the advantages remained in favour of the outside districts, where the population has more air to live in; but the difference in the two rates declined from 5 to 4 per 1000. "This is shewn in the annexed table. TABLE II. Annual rates of mortality per 1000. Ten years, 1861-70. 1871. 1872.

Lewisham District, 1872. The year 1872 was characterized by an unusually mild temperature and heavy rainfall. The prevalent fatal zymotic diseases were diarrhoea, which destroyed 36 lives; scarlet fever, which destroyed 39 lives; and hooping rough, to which 35 deaths were attributed. Typhus, the fever of overcrowding, caused only one death; and enteric fever, caused by pollution of the atmosphere, the soil. or drinking-water, by sewage matter; caused 11 deaths. The mortality from zymotic disease (more fully shown in Table V.), however, only represents a tithe of the suffering occasioned; as for every one who dies of epidemic disease, many have passed through the disease and more or less recovered. And it thus points out how necessary it is to secure to the people the blessings of pure air, both external to habitation*, as well as internal to them; pure drinking water; facilities for personal and domestic cleanliness; us well as hygienic measures of every kind; by which means health and strength may be promoted, and without which suffering, pauperism, and death result.

The Board's Hospital has been of essential service in many cases during the year in preventing the spread of epidemic disease. 18 cases (12 mules and 6 females) have been admitted during the year; 17 were cured and 1 died. The nature of the diseases for which cases were admitted are mentioned below. Scarlet fever 6 Small-pox 9 Sore throat and rash 1 Measles 1 Chicken-pox 1 18 Penge. 1 death took place in the Waterman's Asylum and 1 in the Royal Naval Asylum. North Surrey District School The health of the inmates of the North Surrey District School has been the reverse of good. Opthalmia has been extensively prevalent, and it becomes of the utmost interest to ascertain the causes upon which its continuance depends. From the contagious nature of this disease, when once introduced, it is readily propagated, more especially so amongst an ill-nurtured pauper population ; and nothing is required other than the neglect of hygienic measures to 13 vivify any contagious germs which may bo introduced amongst such a class. The medical treatment has been successful, for individual cases have been repeatedly cured, only, however, to relapse and swell the number of these affected with the disease by communicating it to others; therefore it is clear that some latent causes must still exist. The causes I believe to be, the reception from workhouses of infected children; the want of sufficient water supply; the insufficient cubic contents of the dormitories; the want of ventilation of The dormitories; and the insufficient drainage. Those latter defects I have already brought under your notice, since which nothing has been done to remedy them. Many complaints were made during the latter part of the year of the offensive odour from the land attached to the North Surrey District School, which may be attributed (1st) to the fact th it the sewage is not now, us formerly, passed through Peat charcoal to deodorize it; and (2nd) that the year 1872 was a very wet one, and the irrigation of the land by sewage has been unsuccessful, in consequence of the incapacity of the soil to absorb the quantity of liquid thrown upon it. The North Surrey District School was for many years the healthiest of of its class in the world, and so fur as I am able to judge there are no physical reasons why it should not recover its former prestige. Nine deaths have taken place in the School during the year. Water Supply (Dr. Frankland). "The water delivered by the Kent Company from deep wells in the chalk has again been distinguished throughout the year for its comparative freedom from organic matter. "Taking the proportion of organic elements in a given volume of the Kent Company's water as unit, the following are the maximum, minimum, and average quantities present in each of the other metropolitan waters during the past year. 14 TABLE VIII. Maximum. Minimum Average. Kent 1 1 1 New River 7.2 1.1 3.1 East London 9.2 2.9 4.7 West Middlesex 11.1 2.5 5.2 Southwark 14.0 3.0 5.9 Chelsea 17.0 3.1 6.2 Grand Junction 16.1 2.9 6.4 Lambeth 18.4 3.1 6.6 "The Thames and Lea start from their chief sources as free from organic matter as the deep well water supplied by the Kent Company, but, in the winter months especially, they become much polluted with sewage and the washings of manured fields before they reach the intakes of their respective companies. "Notwithstanding the Act of Parliament passed in the session of 1871 for the purpose of securing a constant supply of water to the Metropolis, the delivery still continues on the old intermittent system. The water drawn from the butts of consumers is much more impure than the samples drawn directly from the mains of the respective companies."

Total. 93 40 30 8 171 : Storm water drains have been executed along part of Sydenham Hill, at a cost of £2116, half the amount being borne by the Camberwell Hoard. Improvements have been made at the Hospital, Hither Green, by the erection of a new Wurd, and other general repairs throughout the building. At Forest Hill there arc at present a great number of houses without an outfall Sewer, and the Hoard have from time to time endeavoured as far as possible to provide a remedy for the evil by offers to contribute towards the cost of the proposed works through the private property, which, however, have not been accepted by the owners, and the works have not therefore been executed. This plan, however, when executed, will only provide for a portion of that locality ; there will still remain a considerable number of houses along St. Germain's Road, leading from the point of boundary on the Forest Hill Road to the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway, which are also without an outfall, and for which a Sewer must be provided ; but the chief part of the houses being at the extreme part of the District, near Camberwell, the Sewer must pass through a long length of arable land, the whole of which, I have no doubt, will at some future time be laid out for building purposes. 19 The following is the route I propose : The Sewer to commence by a junction at Lady well, near the Station at Brockley Lane; thence through a short road by Ladywell public house, and along the Valley Line in a westerly direction through private property, crossing Brockley Lane about 1000 feet south of Brockley Hall, and through the adjoining fields; thence under the Brighton and South Coast Railway and along St Germain's Road to a point about 600 feet east of the Cambcrwell boundary at Honor Oak. The length of the Sewer will be 7678 feet run, or one mile 466 yards; and the following is the estimate in detail, without taking into consideration any compensation for passing through private property, as the proponed works will considerably add to the value of all the land between the watershed and boundary linn Excavations Ft in. £ s. d. 6668 0 12 0 4 6 13336 yards, at la. 6d. 1000 4 0 Excavations 1010 0 12 0 4 0 1792 Yards, at 1s. 6d 134 8 0 Brickwork 6668 0 11 0 9 180 rods, at £16 2880 0 0 Brickwork 1010 0 9 0 9 352 0 0 105 0 0 80 ventilating shafts, at £6 10s 195 0 0 6668 feet run invert blocks, at 1s. 2d. 388 19 4 1010 ditto ditto at 1s. 1d. 54 14 2 £5200 5 6 I am, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, W.

Gentlemen, I have the pleasure of presenting my fourth Annual Report upon works executed in my department. The total cost of the Highways in the Parish of lewisham for labour, cartage, and material, &c., was £7,484 9s. Od. This sum includes the Former New Cross Roads, improving the approaches to Lewisham Bridge, making up Peak Hill Road, and £1,071 12s. 11d. the cost of laying Tar Pavement. In the Hamlet of Penge the total expenses of the Highways were £1,853 0s. 3d., and the sum of £501 6s. 11d. was expended in laving Tar Pavement.' I have prepared the following Table to show the quantities and description of material in cubic yards used and charged during the year. Division. Granite. Bombay Stone. China Stone. Port Phillip. Kentish Rag. Land Picked Flints. Dug Flints. Croydon Gravel. Rushey Green Gravel. Perry Hill Gravel. Total in each Division. yds. yds. yds. yds. yds. yds. yds. yds. yds. yds. yds.

There were 193 days in which rain fell. From the 1st October, until the end of December, I may say there was hardly a fine day, or—at all events—the roads were never dry, and consequently in our absorbent flint roads they became rotten, which necessitated additional care, labor, and material. 21 I believe the roads and paths never were in a better condition (taking them as a whole throughout the District) than at present. I ho middle of Park Road, Dartmouth Park, has been coated with granite, the sides being made up with Hints. Part of the London Road (Forest Hill, and the High Street, Sydenham) was also coated with Granite, which I believe to be a step in the right direction. During the present year I hope to lay more Granite upon the main thoroughfares of the District. The Steam Roller has been used 40 days during the year, at an expend of £s. 10s. 0d. per day, including coke. I have ascertained, from the best authority, the average cost per day for working the roller, if employed during the whole year, is £1 3s., including the driver and steersman's pay, oil, coke, repairs, and interest of money for outlay in the purchase of a roller; it therefore becomes a subject worth consideration whether it would be economical to purchase a roller. As to the economy in Road maintenance in using the steam roller, I can say the road along Limes Terrace, Lewisham, was rolled two and a half years ago, and I have just had occasion to loosen the stones and put a light covering of Granite upon them. Had this road not been rolled I believe I should have had to reeoat it nine months ago. Putting economy aside, I recommend the use of the roller for the sake of humanity, to ease hardly worked horses, and thereby save horse flesh. If I now put down any quantity of material I am sure to hear of it, unless I use the roller at once. Of course, had the Board a roller of their own I should use it more than 10 days during the year. ROAD WATERING. Tho greatest portion of the watering in Lewisham and Blaekheath Village was done by tho Board's men; in Sydenham and Forest Hill at a contract price of Ss. per horse and man ; and in the Hamlet of Penge, 8s. per horse and man. The cost of the watering during the year in the Parish 22 of Lewisham was £2,033 14s. 1d.; and in the Hamlet of Penge, £G51 9s. 8d. A small additional length of road from last year has been watered in Lewisham and Penge by tho Board's order. Several new Stand-posts were erected, three with swanneck pipes, which I find a great improvement upon the oldfashioned untidy hose pipes that are always out of repair. In order to water the roads as efficiently AS possible a greater number of stand-posts would be required. I believe it would be found economical to have four stand-posts on every mile of road watered—a large increase upon the present number. My object in having more stand-poets is to avoid water carts going over the ground empty. The supply of water during the summer at times was deficient. The distributors of the water carts do not throw tho water evenly. I am at present experimenting upon a new distributor. LIGHTING. There arc 500 Lamps in the Parish of Lewisham lighted by the Crystal Palace Gas Company, at a contract price of £4 3s. 4d. per lamp per annum ; and 390 lighted by the Phœnix Gas Company, at a contract price per lamp per annum up to the 19th of October, of £4 13s. 4d., and at the rate of £5 for the rest of the year. 42 new lamps were erected during the year. Southend was lighted; and it is contemplated to complete the lighting of Brockley Lane to the Deptford boundary. In the Hamlet of Penge there arc 274 lamps lighted by the Crystal Palace Gas Company, at a contract price of £4 3s. 4d. per lamp per annum. 5 new lamps were erected in the Hamlet during the year. KERBING AND CHANNELLING. I have appended a Table to this Report giving the value of the Kerbing and Channelling and Tar Pavement laid in each locality of the District during the last four years. In Lewisham Parish Kerbing, Channelling, &c., were laid during the year in the following streets and roads:— 23 The Village of Blackheath was laid with new channelling, a small portion kerbed and channelled near the "Hare and Billet". Iansdowne Terrace, near the "Green Man," was kerbed and channelled d. The Footpaths of the Lewisham Road from lewisham old Station to the boundary with Greenwich have been laid with new kerbing and channelling where necessary, ami the old relaid. Aberdeen Granite crossings were laid as follows in Lowisham— Near the "Roe Buck," Beaufort Gardens, Granville Terrace, near the "Albion" Public House, College Park, Avenue road, Limes Grove, Morley Road, Court Hill Road, and Park Street. In Sydenham and Forest Hill similar crossings were laid at Park Road (west Kent Park), Stanstead Lane, Park Road (Dartmouth Park, two crossings), Perry Vale (two crossing, Queen's Road, Derby Villas, Raglan Street, Sydenham Park (two Crossings), High Street, near entrance to Jews' walk or Sydenham Grove, Peak Hill, and Peak Hill Avenue. A portion of the path from the turning to Forest Hill Station, opposite the Post Office, to the Railway Bridge, kerbed and channel led, and the old material re-set. The southern footpath of Wells Road newly kerbed, and the channelling re-set; also northern footpath from Bell Green to near Sydenham Green kerbed and channelled where necessary, the old material re-set, and a portion of Perry A ale kcrbod and chanuelled. For the cost of this work see the Table. In Penge the following work was executed: kerbing and channelling corners of the following streets, viz.:—Penge Lane, Queen Adelaide Road, Forbes Road, Thornsett Road, Green Lane. Kerbing and channelling in Maple Road, and portions of Dulwich Road ; kerbing and channelling portions of Croydon Road, Anerley Road, and a small portion of kerbing and channelling in Hamlet Road. Two Granite crossings were laid, one across the Anerley Road, near the Maple Road, and the other at the junction of the Maple Road with the Dulwich Road. The cost of the entire work is stilted in the Table. 24 TAR PAVEMENT. I wish to say the Tar Pavement on the footpath from the Mid Kent Railway Bridge to the "Hope" Inn, Loampit Vale, has now been down four years, and some of the Tar Pavement in High Street, Sydenham, Park Rood, Dartmouth Park, and the path from the Old Church, Lewisham, through the Village of Lewisham, Montpelier Vale, Blackheath, &c, has been laid three years. Without comparing Tar Pavement with Rock Asphalte or Concrete, there can be no doubt these paths have been a great boon to the public and a complete success. I hope to paint the whole of them this summer. In Lewisham Parish Tar Pavement was laid upon the following paths during the year—From Hell Green to Sydenham Green; footpath from the corner of Laurie Park to George Road; footpath from opposite Forest Hill Railway Station, in Perry Vale, to near Westbourne Road; Path from the corner of Dartmouth Road, opposite the Forest Hill Post Office, along the London Road, to opposite the Peck ham Road; the path from Forest Hill Railway Station, opposite the Forest Hill Post Office, to the Railway Bridge, near the Devonshire Road. One pathway on Lewisham Hill from the foot of the hill to Eliot Park Road, and the other path from the foot of the hill to opposite Eliot Park. The path in Blackheath Village from the "Crown" Hotel to Lloyd Place, the path along the shops, &c.. at the "Hare and Billet," and the pathway along Lansdownc Place, near the "Green Man," Blackheath. There are 8,667 superficial yards in the whole of this work, and the actual cost was £761 6s. 6d.; after deducting cost of crushing machine, &c., &c., which will make the pavement, say 1s. 9d. per superficial yard. The crushing machine was not purchased until late in the year, and therefore no advantage was obtained from it. Irrespective of the Tar pavement before mentioned, I laid the Tar Pavement in Court Hill Road, Canterbury Road,. Ravensbourne Villa Road, &c; in round numbers, 6,000 additional yards. In the Hamlet of Penge Tar Pavement was laid in the 20 following streets The south-west footway from the Beckenham Boundary in Dulwich Rood to the junction with the Croydon Road; the southern footway of the Croydon Road from the junction with the Dulwich Road to the "Robin Hood public house; the northern footway of the Croydon Road from Anerley. Road to the corner of Weighton Road; the south-east pathway of the Anerley Road from the junction with Hamlet Road to near Anerley Vale; the south-east footPath of that part of Anceley Grove maintained by the Board. There were 4,728 superficial yards in this work, and the coat was £332 19s. 6d.; say 1s. 5d. per supeficial yard. Independent of the above, I laid the Tar Payement in the undermentioned new streets, viz.:—Queen Adelaide Road, Part of Anerley Grove, Clarina Road, and Penge Place, together about 2,100 superficial yards. I had great diilieulty in obtaining a sufficient quantity of Tar, and at times was obliged to pay as much as 3d. per gallon for it. ASPHALTE AND CONCRETE FOOTPATHS, &c. The footpath from Lee Pridge along Granville Terrace, and the Quaggy to the Plough Bridge, was laid with Burnett's Patent .Asphalte, at a cost of 4s, 10d. per superficial yard for footways and 12s. for roadways. There are 1343 superficial yard in the path, and 22 .superficial yards in the crossing near the "Plough." The path form the north Kent Railway bridge to the washway and the paths over lewisham Bridge &e., have been commenced and nearly finished, but I must give the cost of these in my next report. The pathways along the Lewishum Road, from Granville Park to the boundary with Greenwich, was laid with concrete by Messrs. Wilkinson, of Newcastle-on-Tyne, their price per superficial yard being 3s. 6d. far 1½n. work, 8a. 9d for 2-'in. work, and 4s. 3d. for the gate entrances—the Board preparing the foundation. The total cost of the work has been £823 0s. 4d.; had it been done by Burnett's Asphalte Company the cost would have been £1,099 1s. 8d. There arc 3,641 superficial yards of footway, besides kerbing, in the work. of course in these matters time alone will prove which material is the most durable. A short length was laid in one piece of concrete, forming kerbing, channelling, and footpath in Perry Vale, as an experiment. The work was done rather late in the season and the frost caught the channelling before the concrete was set, but the damage done was not material. The work stands and looks very well. The cost of laying this kerbing, &c., was £14 15s. 7d.; had the same been executed in granite, with tar pavement for the footway, the cost would have been about £18. The great advantage in the concrete is that you have a much better path than Tar Pavement at less cost IMPROVEMENTS. The widening of Lewisham Bridge was not quite finished during the year. I prepared plans, &c., of the following improvements, some of which have been carried out and others arc in progress. Improvements in widening the Road near Spring Cottages, and Mr. Sheppard's Cottages, Hither Green Lane have been completed. I prepared plans, sections, &c., to submit to the Metropolitan Board of Works showing the improvement to the road in lowering the gradient of West Hill, Sydenham, and likewise of all the improvements that have been carried out and proposed to be carried out in Brockley Lane for the purpose of obtaining a grant. I also commenced preparing plans for widening the two Railway Bridges in the Anerley Road, Penge, and entered into negociation with the Engineer of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway with reference to giving up the required land. NEW STREETS. In Lewisham the work of paving and forming the following New Streets was completed, viz.:—Raglan Street and Court Hill Road, except a portion of tar pavement which I recommend should not be laid at present; the undermentioned Streets arc in progress, David's Road, Clyde Terrace, Horton Street, Jerrard Street, Thurston Road, Bradford I load, and Prospect Road. In Penge the following Streets have been completed—Anerley Grove, Clarina Road, and Penge Place. The undermentioned Streets Are in progress—Arpley Road, Anerley Park, and Howard Road. I prepared plans, estimates, &c., of the following Street during the year—Bradford Road, Prospect Road, Lower Winchester Pood, Upper Winchester Road, and Kliot Park Roads. In Penge Anerley Park, Howard Rood, and Rood leading to Crystal Palace Station of the London, Brighton and Sooth Coast Railway. DUSTING. The ©out of collecting dust, ashes, &c., in the Parish of Lewisham was £982 3s. 6d., and the sale of dust realised 370 6s. l1d. The work was done under the direction of the Dust inspector by men in the employ of the Board, the necessary horses and earts being hired. In Penge the work was done by contract under the direction of the Inspector of Nuisancer, and cost £184 5s. 0d. for the year.
