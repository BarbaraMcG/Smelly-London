The Board submit with this, their Report for the year 1881-82:— A Statement of their Receipts and Expenditure during the year ended 25th March, 1882, and of their Assets and Liabilities on that day, with the Schedules referred to in such Statements, containing detailed particulars of each item therein. A Statement of comparison of Expenditure between the years 1879-80, 1880-81, and 1881-2. A Table of Loans from the 1st January, 1856, to the 25th March, 1882. A Statement of the Contracts entered into by the Board during the year ended 25th March, 1882. The Board also submit the Report of their Medical Officer of Health, for the year ended 31st December, 1881, containing particulars of the population, rate of mortality, and other statistics relating to the general health of the District; and the Report of the Board's Surveyor for the year ended Lady-day, 1882, in which will be found the particulars of the works carried out under his supervision. LOANS. Among the Financial arrangements of the Board may be mentioned the important step taken for the Consolidation of Loans, by which a very considerable saving in interest was secured. With a view to such consolidation the Board, in most of their recent mortgages, obtained the insertion of a clause empowering them to pay off the mortgage on six months' notice, and in the year now under review they, under the advice of their Finance Committee, decided to 8 avail themselves of this power. On the 12th October, 1881, the Committee reported:- "As to the proposal to Consolidate the Mortgage Loans of the Board, the Committee would refer the Board to their last Report on this subject, and to their Chairman's statement made same time (see Min., 6 July, pars. 4-3 and 6). "The Money Bill of the Metropolitan Board having passed through Parliament, application was made to that Board to advance the Lewisham District Board £26,439 15s., the necessary amount to pay off the existing Loans referred to, out of the funds at their disposal. And the Metropolitan Board have acceded to this application as follows:— (a) The Metropolitan Board, subject to the approval of the Treasury being obtained thereto, have agreed to advance this Board the sum of £24,800, at the rate of per cent, per annum, payable quarterly, on condition of the principal being repaid in 20 years, by annual instalments of £1,600 for the first 12 years, and of £700 per annum for the last 8 years. (b) By this arrangement the repayments under the old loans would be as nearly as possible averaged ; and with regard to the difference between the amount proposed to be advanced and that asked for (£1639) 15s.), it is stipulated that this Board should pay it out of the rates of 1882. (c) I he Metropolitan Board have intimated that, should this Board require their sanction for the temporary borrowing of the balance, viz., £1639 15s., they would be prepared to consider any application submitted for that purpose. The arrangement for repayment of loans specified above, vaning somewhat from the Metropolitan Board's original order on the subject, the sanction of that Board to the alteration proposed had been applied for and obtained. "The Committee beg to report that they have accepted the advance of £24,800 from the Metropolitan Board, at a rate of 3¾ per cent., on the conditions set out in the foregoing." 9 By this operation a considerable annual saving has been effected, the previous loans having borne interest at rates varying from £4 5s. per cent, to £4 15s. per cent. A special vote of thanks was given by the Board to Mr. Williams, the then Chairman of the Finance Committee, for carrying out this important consolidation of these loans. IMPROVEMENTS. The Surveyor in his Report has given the usual particulars of the various improvements effected during the year. Further progress has been made in the improvements at the Forest Hill Railway Station, and during the year now under review, the works of widening the road under the bridge north of the Station were commenced. In their last Report, the Board gave a summary of the terms of the agreement between themselves and the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Company, with reference to this improvement, and the alterations to be made in the Station. The manner in which the Company have proceeded with the alterations in the subway, more especially with regard to their avowed intention of substituting steps for the incline, is not such as the Board can approve, and it is feared that the Company will not fall in with this Board's views in the matter, and that the only course open to the Board will be to endeavour to enforce the terms of the agreement by legal proceedings, however much such a course may be against their wishes. THE BOARD'S HOSPITAL. This Establishment, referred to in the Board's last Report, has been maintained during the year in readiness for all emergencies, and has enabled the Board to isolate at once, certain cases of infectious disease which might otherwise have endangered the health of the District; but the Board are able to congratulate the residents of the District 10 upon the absence of any serious outbreak of disease, such as might perhaps demonstrate the greater utility of this sani- tary provision. NEW STREETS AND SEWERS. The various works carried out by the Board under this head will, as in former years, be found specified in the Surveyor's Report. The most important Sewerage work of the year, however, in the District is the outfall Sewer to be constructed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, from Deptford to Lee Bridge, which has been commenced and is now proceeding. INUNDATIONS. This subject has continued to occupy the Board's most serious attention, and happily the year just closed has not been signalized by any serious inundation, such as that experienced in the year 1878. During the year, the County Bridge over the Quaggy near the Plough Inn, at Lewisham, has been widened and improved, and the Board have—in pursuance of the undertaking given, as stated in their last Report—acquired the land necessary for the new bridge, and carried out the works undertaken by them, so that the full advantage of the new bridge might be obtained for the benefit of the inhabitants. Besides this work the Board have carried out other improvements, viz.:— ( a) The widening and clearing the Quaggy from the Plough Bridge to the River Ravensbourne. (b) The widening the watercourse at the Silk Mills, and (c) Constructing a culvert at Mid Kent Cottages. These works the Board have every reason to believe, will greatly facilitate the flow of water in flood times, and mitigate the evils which have resulted from this source in previous years. 11 FIRE-PLUG INDICATORS. These indicators are marked upon the gas lamps to indicate the position of the various fire-plugs in the District. The Board again refer to them in this year's Report, feeling assured that this information cannot be too frequently brought before the public. STREET NAMING, &c. During the year the following Orders have been made by the Metropolitan Board, altering Street names, &c. An Order (29th April, 1881), for re-naming Blind Lane, Perry Hill, " Vancouver Road, S.E." „ (29th April, 1881), for re-naming Three Tuns Alley, "Tranquil Passage, S.E." „ (13th May, 1881), for re-numbering the houses in Upper Winchester Road. „ (1st July, 1881), for re-numbering the houses in Station Road, Penge. „ (3rd February, 1882), for re-naming Lewisham Road, "Lewisham Lower Road, S.E.," and re-numbering the houses therein.* SANITARY. The Sanitary condition of the district continues highly satisfactory, as will be seen by a careful perusal of the Report of the Medical Officer appended hereto; and the number of inhabited houses and the population of the District also continues to increase, as shown by the table in the Medical Officer's Report annexed (page 8). The number in each case, at Midsummer, 1881, being— Inhabited houses 11,400 Estimated Population 71,508 The constant attention paid by the Board, through * Note.— This order has since been rescinded by the Metropolitan Board, on the application of the residents, strongly supported by the Board. 12 its Local Committees, to the Sanitary requirements of the District is attended by the most beneficial results. The Return, (Table VI), shows the number of complaints brought under the notice of the Committees, and the proceedings taken thereon. The Slaughter-houses, Cowhouses, and Fishmongers' premises, have been periodically inspected by the Board's Sanitary Officers. Under this head should perhaps be mentioned a sanitary matter to which considerable time and attention is devoted by the Board's Committees and their Officers, and which is of great importance to the health of a growing community, viz., the collection and removal of Dust, &c. The great cost of this work, and the constantly increasing difficulty attending the disposal of the matter collected, renders it almost impossible for the Board to arrange for the clearance of each house more than once in every two weeks. This the Board endeavour to do, and they have by circular and otherwise, appealed to householders to assist them. The Board now urgently request all householders to see that the men are not refused the dust on calling, and that any vegetable or animal matter that may be burnt, buried, or otherwise destroyed, is not placed in the Ashpits. The Board may also remind householders that it is an offence, punishable by fine, to refuse the Dust when called for by the Board's Scavengers. The Circular issued by the Board, under the signature of their Clerk, was in the following terms:— Removal of Dust, &c. The attention of the Board has been called to complaints of the non-removal of dust from premises within their District, and it has been reported to them that the complaints are generally not so much as to the quantity of dust in the ashpits as of the offensive character of. their contents, caused by decomposed vegetable and animal matter and other refuse thrown into the same. The Board are of opinion that the deposit of such matter or other similar refuse in the ashpits is, particularly at this season of the year, very objectionable, and that such refuse should be burnt or otherwise destroyed 13 or disinfected. They have, therefore, directed that the attention of all householders should be called to the subject, with a request that they would prevent the continuance of the practice referred to as far as possible. "The dustmen employed by the Board take regular rounds in the District, being required to call at each house about once every fortnight, and it is impracticable, without very greatly increasing the already heavy cost, that the men should call more frequently at any house or otherwise than in their regular rounds, and if they are refused by servants or others, on their first call, as is sometimes the case, they cannot call again until their next round. "I am, therefore, to request the assistance of householders generally in facilitating the collection of the dust in the manner prescribed. "The men are employed by the Board and paid as public servants, and are not entitled to require any fee or gratuity for the performance of their work ; any complaint of inattention or incivility on their part sent to this office will receive immediate attention." RATEABLE VALUE. The Rateable Value of the District on the quinquennial Valuation which came into force in April, 1881, gave the following figures:— Lewisham £376,087 Penge 153,652 Total £529,739 In the latest Supplemental List, the figures are £394,350 and £158,127 respectively, showing an increase of— Lewisham £18,203 Penge 4,475 Total increase £22,738 14 DANGEROUS RAILWAY BRIDGES. Among the many subjects which have occupied the Board's attention, although, perhaps, more of a local than a general character, may be mentioned the Bridges carrying Railways over Roads in the District, particularly two in Lewisham. The noise occasioned by passing trains has, upon several occasions, alarmed horses, and accidents have occurred in consequence. The Board have brought the matter before the Railway Company by letter, and specially by deputation, and have also been in communication with the Board of Trade thereon, but they have not yet succeeded in obtaining any improvement. BARRIERS IN ROADS. Some attention has been paid to the subject of barriers fixed in New Roads by owners of property, thus preventing the free use by the public of the roads. An Act is understood to be under consideration of Parliament for dealing more effectually with the subject. SALE OF FOOD, &c., ACTS. The Board's attention has been specially directed to these Acts. The absence of any action by the public in their own behalf early attracted more than usual notice, and the Board considered that some effort should be made to facilitate the working of the Acts by private individuals, and with this view made certain arrangements wherebv action by the general public is made more easy. The particulars of these arrangements were embodied in a notice, a copv of which is hereunder given. The Board feel assured that if the public would avail themselves of the facilities thus afforded great benefit would ensue. The Notice referred to. "The attention of the Board having been called to the bility of giving greater facilities than at present exist to the general public in aid of the working of 'The sale of Food and 15 Drugs Acts,' they have now made arrangements with the Public Analyst of the District, Mr. C. Heisch, of 79, Mark Lane, B.C., whereby samples and articles desired by any resident in the District to be analysed may be left with the Secretary of the Board, during office hours, at their Offices, and no further trouble in the matter need then fall on such resident, as, in the event of such sample proving upon analysis to be adulterated, the resident is not compelled to prosecute the seller. A fee of 2s. 6d., which must be paid at once, will be charged for each sample brought by a resident for analysis, the balance of the Analyst's fee of 10s. 6d. will be paid by the Board. "Care should be taken that the samples brought for analysis are in the same condition as when bought. The name and address of the seller must be supplied, and the buyer must sign the proper form, which will be prepared at the Board's Offices. All samples received for analysis are accepted in strict confidence, and the result will be communicated to the buyer direct by post. "The only expense to the buyer is the payment of the before-mentioned fee of 2s. Gd. "If residents within the District have reasonable ground for suspecting any seller of adulterating, they may write to the Board, giving the name and address of the seller and the article suspected, and enclosing a double fee of 5s., when the Board will direct their Inspectors of Nuisances to take the necessary steps for obtaining an analysis without further reference or expense to the resident; and if the article is found to be adulterated further steps will be taken by the Board. Such communications will also be received in strict confidence. No notice can be taken of anonymous communications, although the fee may be enclosed." TRAMWAYS. In the early part of the last Session of Parliament, Bills were introduced for the Construction of Tramways in Lewisham and Penge. The Bill relating to Lewisham was entitled "The Lewisham and District Tramways." That affecting Penge, "The Norwood, Penge, and Crystal Palace District Tramways." As to the former, the Board decided to oppose the Scheme, and so informed the promoters; and 16 they were enabled, by their opposition, to prevent this Bill passing the Standing Orders' Committee. The Board also determined to oppose the latter Scheme, but met with more serious opposition from the promoters, inasmuch as it was held that over two-thirds of the line was in the Croydon District, and that the authority of that District approved of the project. This Tramway was designed, as stated by the promoters, for the purpose of giving to the Croydon people additional facilities for getting to the Crystal Palace. To attain this object, the promoters proposed laying the Tramway lines over 1½ miles of the Roads in Penge, and across the narrow bridge over the railway near the Anerley Station. It was estimated, that if this Scheme were allowed to be carried out, it would shortly necessitate the re-construction of this Bridge at an expense varying from £2,500 to £3,000, and that the increased expense of the maintenance of the Roads over which the Tramway passed, would also necessitate a largely increased annual expenditure. The Board also received a deputation of the Inhabitants of Penge, asking them to oppose the Scheme in Parliament. This was accordingly done, and after long consideration the select Committee, to which the Bill was referred, held that the Preamble was not proved, and the Bill was thrown out so far as it affected the Hamlet of Penge; and it accordingly passed only authorising tramways in the parish of Croydon.

R E POR T TO The Board of Work for the Lewisham District, TO THE END OF THE YEAR, 1881, BY F. EACHUS WILKINSON M.D., &c., Medical Officer of Health for the District. Gentlemen, The estimated population of the Lewisham District at the middle of the year 1881 amounted to 71,508 persons, resident in 11,400 houses. This will closely approach the enumerated population, 71,702. The Tables illustrating this Report are as under:— Table I. gives the estimated population, the number of inhabited houses, and the births, deaths, and marriages which have taken place in the District during the year 1881 and the 10 previous years. Table II. gives the annual rate of mortality, death rates amongst children, and death rates at the several public institutions in the District. Table III. gives the deaths registered at several groups of ages from different causes during the year. Table IV. gives the mortality from certain classes of diseases, and the proportions to population, and to 1,000 deaths in 1881. Table V. gives the number of deaths in the 10 years, 2 1871 to 1880 inclusive, from the seven principal zymotic diseases, and the number in 1881. Table VI. gives the Inspectors' Reports of the sanitary work completed during the year. Table VII. gives the number of inhabited houses, the estimated population in 1881, with the birth and death rate in the Registrar's Sub-districts in the Lewisham Parish, and the Hamlet of Penge, together comprising "the Lewisham District." Table VIII. gives the area, the census population in the years 1861 and 1871, the estimated population in 1881, and the mortality in various Metropolitan Districts, and in England and Wales. Table IX. gives the population, the number of persons to an acre of ground, the number of births and deaths, the annual birth and death rates, the mean temperature and rainfall in London and 22 large towns of the United Kingdom, and of the Lewisham District. Table X. The number of children between the ages of 3 and 13 years attending public elementary and certified efficient schools in the Parish of Lewisham and in the Hamlet of Penge during the year 1881. Table XI. A Register of the licensed cow-houses in the District, together with a list of the milk sellers in the District who have no licenses. Table XII. A list of the licensed slaughter-houses in the District. Marriages. During in the year 1881, 386 Marriages took place in the Lewisham Parish, of which 306 were solemnized in the 3 several Church of England Churches, 41 in Dissenting Chapels, and 39 at the Registrar's Office. In the Hamlet of Penge 114 Marriages took place, of which 98 were solemnized in Church of England Churches, 8 in Dissenting Chapels, and 8 at the Registrar's Office. Births. The Registered Births in the District in the year 1881 amounted to 2,199. Males 1,129, Females 1,070. The Birth Rate to population was 30.75 per 1,000. In London 132,674 births were registered, the annual Birth Rate being 34.7 per 1,000. In England and Wales 883,518 were registered, the annual Birth Rate being 339 per 1,000. The nat ural increase of population by excess of births over deaths in the Lewisham district was 1123. Deaths. The number of Deaths registered in the Lewisham District during the year 1881 was 1,076, being 22 in excess of the number registered during the previous year. The annual rate of mortality per 1,000 was 15.04. The annual rate of mortality in England and Wales in the year 1881 was 18.9. In the Metropolitan and City Police Districts 20.3. In Registration London, 21.2; and in the districts outside Registration London, 16.4 per 1,000. By reference to Table III., which gives the mortality registered at several groups of ages, it will be seen that, of the 1,076 Deaths registered from all causes in 1881, 406 died under the age of 5 years. 274 deaths occurred under 1 year of age. 64 between the ages of 1 and 2 68 „ „ 2 „ 5 45 „ „ 5„ 15 54 „ „ 15 „ 25 75 „ „ 25 „ 35 64 „ „ 35 „ 45 84 „ „ 45 „ 55 99 „ „ 55 „ 65 122 „ „ 65 „ 75 108 „ „ 75 „ 85 15 „ „ 85 „ 95 4 „ „ 95 and upwards. Of the diseases which produced this mortality— 175 took place from zymotic diseases. 192 „ „ constitutional diseases. 511 „ „ local diseases. 165 „ „ developmental diseases. 24 „ „ violent deaths. 9 „ „ not specified or ill defined. Water Supply. The supply of Water should not only be abundant in quantity but pure in quality, and properly filtered before delivery. This has been fairly carried out during the year in this district. But, in addition to this, the cisterns for the storage of 5 drinking water should be kept scrupulously clean and free from the possibility of contamination, For this purpose cisterns should be placed in accessible situations, in order that they may be readily and frequently inspected and cleansed. Care must also be taken that no contamination takes place from any connection with the water-closet or drain. Sewer Gases. Continued watchful care is required to prevent the ingress of foul air, the poisonous product of sewage putrefaction, and the vehicle for epidemic germs from house to house, into dwellings. Houses are frequently found which communicate with sewers and drains by soil pipes constructed within the house, by waste pipes, overflow pipes, sink pipes, bath pipes, and lavatory pipes, which, although supposed to be secured by traps, completely fail to attain their object. No oil pipe should be constructed within a house, and whether within or without the house should be ventilated by an upright shaft with a "Banner's cowl." No direct communication should exist by means of any of these before-mentioned pipes and the sewer They should pass through the wall and terminate with a free end over a trapped drain outside the building, remembering that every pipe entering a sewer is a chimney to the drain. The ventilating shafts to sewers and gullies in the roadway are often complained of as emitting filthy odours, but they arc useful in protecting houses from pressure of gasses, and disinfectants are used by order of the Board to obviate this nuisance. 6 If however, every inhabitant would place a small amount of disinfectant (say solution of permanganate of potash) daily into the drain or closet, a sewer would be comparatively free from odour. Cow Houses and Dairies. As milk should constitute the solo diet of infants, and is the frequent diet of invalids, and forms a portion of the daily diet of all classes of society, it becomes of serious importance that this nutritious food should be of pure quality. The surroundings of cow houses and dairies should bo kept scrupulously clean, and any sick animal should be removed from contact with healthy ones, and the milk should be thrown awav. The attendance upon cows by those who have recently been the subject of epidemic diseases, should be forbidden. The water used for scalding and washing cans must bo of a pure description. * The requirements for cow-houses are, that—They must be well ventilated and lighted. That there must bo a cubic space of not less than 800 feet per cow; the sides and flooring must be of some solid and impervious description; proper paving and drainage of the cow house and adjoining yard; a good water supply; a properly constructed dung pit, and a clean, covered, impervious receptacle for grains. The cow-houses must be cleansed, and the manure removed thcrehom, twice daily; and all refuse removed therefrom at least three times a week before 7 a.m. The Board's Hospital. Our well-situated, excellent and well-appointed little 7 Hospital has not been used so much as it might have been during the year. Only 14 cases of epidemic disease—7 small-pox and 7 scarlet fever—having been treated during the year 1881 ; but it must be remarked that the removal of these cases from their homes and isolating them, has prevented the spread of disease to their families and others. Disinfection. The disinfecting apparatuses have been in frequent requisition; 171) houses, and apparel therein, having been disinfected during the year. The establishment of Mortuaries; of Baths and "Washhouses; of Lavatories; of Abattoirs, have been from time to time before the Board for their consideration. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. E. WILKINSON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health to the Lewisham District. 8 TABLE I.

SURVEYOR'S REPORT Of work executed from Lady-day, 1881, to Lady-day, 1882. Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Thirteenth Annual Report. HIGHWAYS. I have prepared the following Table, which will give the quantity of material used upon the roads maintained by the Board:— Division. Granite. 1 Dug Flints. Gravel. Total. Lewisham Parish, cubic yards 5592 3074 1512 10,178 Hamlet of Penge, ditto 566 969 197 1732 Total 6158 4043 1709 11,910 The rainfall from 26th March, 1881, to 25th of March, 1882, (inclusive, as given by the rain guage at Forest Hill Stoneyard,) was as follows:— Nutnber of days on which rain fell. inches dec. 0 1881 March 26th to 31st, inclusive 0.00 6 April 0.32 7 May 1.13 9 June 1.67 10 July 2.13 16 August 5.12 11 September 1.79 10 October 2.46 12 November 2.39 13 December 2.33 10 1882 January 1.13 7 February 0.98 5 March to the 25th, inclusive 0.31 116 21.76 2 Rain fell upon 116 days, and there was a rainfall of 4.52in. less this year than in the corresponding period last year. On account of the long frost, &C., which took place last year some of the material, that should have been put on during that year, was not laid upon the roads until the beginning of this year, consequently more material appears in the table to have been used than was paid for during the year. The total quantity used in the Parish of Lewisham was very near the estimate, and in the Hamlet of Penge a little under the estimated quantity. The roads generally are in good condition, but they must not be allowed to go short of material. There has been a large increased amount of traffic during the year over the Bromley road on account of the construction of the West Kent Sewer. It was fortunate that a long length of this road had been coated with granite some short time before the Sewer Works commenced, otherwise it would have been in a very bad state from the heavy traffic. I find the traffic increases very much throughout the District year by year. I feel sure I am within the mark when I say the traffic upon the main roads has doubled during the last ten years. This will show the importance of maintaining the roads in a state of efficiency to meet such increased traffic. The substitution of granite for flint is being gradually carried out, but, in such a large District, it must necessarily be a work of time. WATERING. The work of watering the Blackheath roads and the greater part of the Lewisham Roads was done by the Board's horses and men. Mr. Lane, of Rushey Green, supplied horses and men at 9s. per day for each horse, harness and man, to do the remaining portion of the work in Lewisham. In the Sydenham and Forest Hill Division Mr. Stimpson contracted to supply horses, harness, and men at 8s. 9d. per day for each horse, man, &c., and in Lower Sydenham the same party undertook the work at 8s. 9d. per day or each horse, man, &c. In the Hamlet of Penge the work was one by Mr. Winnifrith at 8s. 3d. per day for each horse, man, and harness, the Board in every case supplying the water wagon or eart. The following is the number of miles of road watered in each division of the district. Locality. Miles. Yards. Lewisham and Blackheath 17 20 Sydenham and Forest Hill 17 774 Hamlet of Penge 9 1202 Total 44 236 3 The supply of water in the Kent Company's District was good during the season, but the supply in the Lambeth Company's District was deficient, and interfered with the work being as efficiently done as it would have been had the supply been better. I believe the Company's officers did their best to meet our demands. The Greenwich Boundary Roads were watered by us under an agreement with the Greenwich Board of Works, and also the road of Sydenham Hill according to agreement with the Camberwell Vestry. The Lambeth Company reduced the price £5 per mile for some of the Roads, making a total saving of £87 10s. for the vear. STREET LIGHTING. At present there are in the Parish of Lewisham 599 lamps lighted by the S.nth Metropolitan Gas Company, and 643 lighted by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company. There are also 336 lamps lighted by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company in the Hamlet of Penge. The present sum paid for lighting the street lamps is as follows: —In the South Metropolitan Gas Company's District £3 17s. per lamp per annum, and in the Crystal Palace e District Gas Company's District £4 0s. 3d. This price includes cleaning, lighting the lamps, and extinguishing them, also painting the lamp columns. The Crystal Palace District (Jos Company, in September, reduced their price Is. 7d. per lamp per annum. This will effect a saving of £77 10s. 1d. per annum. The following is a list of the new lamps erected during the year:— Lewisham. Blackheath 3 Bradford Koad 1 Brigade Street 1 Brookbank Street 2 Champion Hill 1 Cranstone Road 1 Dacres Road 2 Devonshire Road 1 Elderton Road 1 Elgin Terrace 1 Engleheart Road 3 Ewart Road Passage 1 4 Lewisham— Continued.

One of Sugg's "Whitehall" lamps was erected at the Fountain at Sydenham. DUSTING. The Dust and Ashes were collected in Lewisham Parish by horses and carts belonging to the Board, and men in the employ of the Board; the Dust being disposed of by contract to Mr. William Jerrard, Lewisham, Mr. Lane, Rushey Green, and Mr. Batchelor, Perry Rise. The Parish was divided into four districts, Mr. Batchelor taking two of them. The Hamlet of Penge was divided into two divisions, Mr. Baker taking one portion of the dust, and The Beckenham and Penge Brickworks Company the other. The Dust collected in Lewisham amounted to 5781½ Loads, and in the Hamlet of Penge 3448 Loads. The total sum the 5 Dust realized in the whole District was £540 2s. 0d.

BOARD'S HORSES. The health of the Horses generally has been good throughout the year. A mild form of influenza passed through the stable, but it was taken in time and the horses attacked soon recovered. I regret baring to report that a case of glanders occurred. When the disease becalme apparent the horse was slaughtered at once, and the stable disinfected, &c. I often wish it could be arranged to keep horses at Sydenham or Forest Hill, as well as at Catford. NEW WORKS. Kerbing, Channelling, Crossings, &c. Lewisham Parish.

The work of flushing the Sewers is very much increasing. There was a large number of summonses taken out against Builders for non-compliance with the Board's regulations for the ventilation of house drains, for commencing building without giving notice, and for allowing houses to be occupied before being drained.

Several important works for the relief of floods at Lewisham, were undertaken and carried out during the year. First amongst these was the re-building of the Plough Bridge. This was done by the County of Kent, at the instigation of the Lewisham Board of Works. supported by the Plmnstead Board of Works. A Deputation consisting of represntatives of the two Boards waited upon the Justices at the Sessions, when an order was passed by the Court to undertake the work upon the Lewisham Board providing any land required for the new bridge, widening the waterway below the proposed bridge, and paying all compensation. The new bridge was constructed 80 feet southward of the old bridge, and crises the road at an angle of about 45° in place of nearly square, as in the ease of the old structure. The span of the new bridge is 25 feet 0 inches, that of the old bridge some 16 feet 0 inches. The new structure having a level soffit, gives more than double the waterway of the old bridge. The Lewisham Board widened or increased the width of the Quaggy below the new bridge, to the junction with the Ravensbourne, from 16 feet to 21 feet, the average of the new waterway being 126 superficial feet. The Earl of Dartmouth, who is the Freeholder, gave the land for doing the work. The old watercourse from the culvert under the North Kent Railway, near the Lewisham Junction Railway Station, was rc-opencd to the Ravensbourne, and a culvert constructed under the roadway, &c., at Mid-Kent Cottages. This culvert has a sectional area of 20 superficial feet. The water from the Ravensbourne discharges into the culvert over a head wall, the level of which is 6 inches higher than the overflow weir at the Silk Mills. The Board also widened the watercourse leading from the bottom of the overflow weir at the Silk Mills to the Ravensbourne. The widening was effected on the ground occupied by Mr. Tyler; the Freeholder, the Karl of Dartmouth, veiy libeially gning up the requisite land for carrying out the work. These works cannot fail to relieve the flooding, although, of course, they are not put forward as a complete remedy. The total cost of the work carried out by the Board was eighteen hundred pounds. When we consider the large amount 12 of benefit derived, I have every confidence in saying the money is well spent. The work was done by contract. There are other works for the abatement of flooding under consideration, which I need not at present particularize. The Metropolitan Board of Works commenced the construction of a new Sewer G feet in diameter, from the Broadway, Deptford, to Lee Bridge, and the work is progressing rapidly. This Sewer will greatly relieve the present Sewer in times of storms, and cannot fail to be a boon to the inhabitants of parts of Lewisham. I am very glad to be able to say we have been free from flooding during the year. The question of the drainage of the Priory Estate and the extension of a Sewer to Southend has been under the consideration of the Lewisham Board, and the Metropolitan Board of Works have been asked to make the Sewer, or contribute towards the cost of it. Nothing has yet been arranged. A Sewer is very much needed. An inventory of all the tools, and plant, &c., belonging to the Board, and used in my department, was taken. A large number of plans, reports, &c., was prepared by me during the year, and other matters which it is not neeessary for me to mention in this report. More than a thousand letters have been written by me. I append to this report a list, of New Streets sanctioned by the Metropolitan Board of Works. I ha\e the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient humble Servant, JOHN CARLINE, C.E., Mem. San. Inst. (Surveyor to the Board). The Board of Works for the Lewisham District. 13 NEW STREETS SANCTIONED.
