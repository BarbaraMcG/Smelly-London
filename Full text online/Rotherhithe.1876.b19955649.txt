George Wells, the former clerk of the works for sewers having left the service of the Vestry, advertisements were issued for applications for the situation to be sent in and on the 11th day of April 1876, James E. Poole was appointed as clerk of the works in the stead of the said George Wells, at a salary of £2 2s. per week. The owner of the new property in Luxford Street having appealed to the Metropolitan Board of Works against an order made by the Vestry with reference to the drainage of the said street. The appellant applying to have the sewer laid only partly up the street and objecting to the amount of the estimated cost of the said drain. Upon the hearing, the Board dismissed the appeal in consequence of the same not having been made within the time specified in the Act of Parliament. The owner having subsequently submitted to the Vestry an amended plan for the drainage of his property in Luxford Street, the Vestry agreed upon payment by the owner of the estimated cost of the work to lay part only of the said sewer for the present, which has since been carried out. An appeal having been made to the Metropolitan Board of Works by Mr. E. Robson on behalf of the School Board for London, against an order made by the Vestry that the drainage for the new Board Schools in Suffolk Street should be carried southward into the low level sewer in lieu of connecting the proposed drains with the sewer in the rear of Dartmouth Terrace as applied for, the last mentioned sewer being considered not to be of sufficient capacity to take the drainage of the said schools Upon the hearing, the Metropolitan Board of Works allowed the appeal but the School Boaad for London subsequently arranged to drain the Suffolk Street Schools as ordered by the Vestry, and the Board having paid the sum of £91 13s 10d. the estimated cost thereof, a 15-inch pipe drain was laid by the Vestry from the low level sewer in the Rotherhithe Branch Road up to the schools and the drainage thereof completed. 15 Notice has been given to Messrs. Branham Brothers and Company under the 86th section of the Metropolis Local Management Act to fill up the open ditch between their premises and All Saints Churchyard, and to construct a proper covered drain for the discharge of the water. &c., from their premises into the sewer in the Dcptford Lower Road. Upon the application of the sewers labourers in August 1876, the Vestry raised the wages of the men from £1. 6s. 0d. to £1 10s. 0d. per week, upon the condition that they find their own boots for working in the sewers. A communication having been received from Mr. George Legg, the surveyor of sewers, calling attention to the increase of the duties of his office, his want of assistance, and to the salary of the office. (£250 per annum) be unremunerativc. The Vestry appointed a special committee of the whole Board to consider the matter. The Committee brought up their Report to the Vestry on the 7th November 1876, when it was Resolved, that the Report of the Committee be adopted, and that an increase of £50 per annum be made to the salary of the surveyor of sewers; th at his son be not associated with him in the office, but the Vestry see no objection to the surveyor of sewers obtaining such assistance in his duties as he may find necessary." By order of the Vestry notices were in July 1876 served upon the owners of property along the river side who had drainage out-falls into the Thames, requiring them to cut off such out-falls from the river, and to provide other drainage for their premises into the sewers adjacent thereto, and the necessary works required for that purpose have since been carried out.

The following arc copies of Dr. John Muter's (the Analyst) Reports for the four quarters ending 25th March, 1877.— Central Public Laboratory, Kennington Cross, London, S.E. 30th June, 1876. To the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe Gentlemen.— I have to report that during the past quarter I have received and analysed 14 samples of articles of food, including 8 butters, 4 milks and 2 sweets, of these the following two were proved to be admixtures, viz:— 11th May—Butter contained 75 per cent. foreign fat. 17th May—Butter „ 75 „ „ I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) JOHN MUTER. Central Public Laboratory, Kennington Cross, S.E. London, 7 th October, 1876. To the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, Gentlemen.— In terms of the Act I have to report the receipt of 6 articles of food from the Inspector during the past quarter, viz:—2 of gin and 4 of butter. The gin was the ordinary weak and sweetened article commonly sold over the counter. 20 but contained nothing deleterious; while two samples of so called butter proved to be almost entirely made up from fat. I do not think it would be fair on my part to draw any conclusion as to the real state of the district food supply from so limited an inspection.

At at Special Meeting of the Vestry, held on the 23rd May, 1876, to consider the scheme of the Thames Steam Ferry Company (limited) for a proposed approach to the Ferry, to he submitted to the Metropolitan Board of Works, it was "Resolved that this Vestry having inspected the plans of the new street proposed to be formed in this Parish by the Thames Steam Ferry Company (limited), and having viewed the line of the said new street, are of opinion that it will be advantageous to this Parish, that the same shall be formed as shown by such plans and as pointed out by Mr. Waller on such view, and that a letter be written to the Metropolitan Board of Works with a copy of this resolution " On the 30th May, 1870, at a Special Meeting called for the purpose of considering the matter, the Vestry gave instructions to the Surveyor of Sewers to prepare a plan shewing the street improvements required in this Parish, including the approach to the Thames Steam Ferry. 24 On the 27th June, 1876, the Surveyor of Sewers submitted a plan of a scheme for widening Rotherhithe Street from Cherry Garden Street eastward, also Church Street, Adam Street, and Union Road, by the Royal Oak P.H., &c., which plan was then approved by the Vestry, and a memorial was prepared praying that the Metropolitan Board of Works would carry out the whole of the improvements shown upon the said plan as public improvements for the general benefit of the Metropolis at large, and such memorial was presented to the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 30th June, 1876, by a Deputation, appointed by the Vestry for that purpose, consisting of the following Gentlemen, viz:—Messrs. Robert Foottit and Edward James Talbot, Churchwardens, and Messrs. John Bulmer, Edward John Cox, Reuben Henry Williams, junr., Robert Allen, James Powell and Henry Hay ward. The Vestry have since received the following communication from the clerk to the Metropolitan Board of Works, on the subject, viz:— Metropolitan Board of Works, Spring Gardens, S.W., 10th August, 1876, Sir, I have to state, for the information of the Vestry of Rotherhithe, that the Board has resolved to submit to Parliament in the next session, a Bill to authorise some further street improvements in the Metropolis, and has further resolved to include in the Bill the widening of the thoroughfare from Tooley Street to Dockhead to feet 50 by taking down the south side and north side of parts of Tooley Street, the south side of Freeschool Street and the south side of Thornton Street; the widening of Dockhead, the widening of Union Road, between Paradise Street and Market Place, Rotherhithe; and the widening of Jamaica Road Bermondsey. The Engineer and Architect of the Board have been instructed to report whether they can suggest any better plans for effecting these improvements than those already submitted to the Board, and the report of these officers is to be considered before a final decision is come to on the subject. The other improvements in the Parish of Rotherhithe, suggested in the Memorial presented by the Vestry to the Board on the 30th June last, remain for consideration at a future time. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Signed) J. E. WAKEFIELD, Clerk to the Board. To the Clerk of the Vestry of Rotherhithe. 25 Metropolitan Hoard of Works, Spring Gardens, 14th November, 1877. Gentlemen, The Hoard has had under consideration the Memorial presented to it on the 30th June last by a Deputation from the Vestry of Rotherhithe setting forth a number of street improvements which the Vestry thought desirable that the Hoard should carry out. With reference thereto, I am directed to state that the Hoard has resolved to apply to Parliament in the next session for power to widen parts of Hermondsey Street Tooley Street Dockhead, Jamaica Road, and L'nion Road; to form a new thoroughfare from St. George's Church in the Horouph to Southwark Hridge Road, and to improve the approaches to Deptford Creek Hridge. As regards the other improvements suggested in the Memorial. 1 am directed to state that the Hoard is not prepared to undertake them. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) J. E. WAKhFIED, Clerk to the Hoard To the Clerk of the Vestry of Rotherhithe. Metropolitan Hoard of Works, Spring Gardens, 14th November, 1877. Gentlemen. Referring to your letter of the 24th May last forwarding a copy of a resolution of the Vestry of Rotherhithe approving a suggestion made by the 1 hamcs Steam Ferry Company, that a new street should be formed to improve the approaches to the Company's landing stage at Church Stairs Wharf. I am directed to inform you that the Hoard having given the matter due consideration, has informed the Steam Ferry Company that it is not prepared to entertain the proposal. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) J. E. WAKEFIELD, Clerk of the Board To the Clerk of the Vestry of Rotherhithe. 26 At the commencement of the session of 1877, the Metropolitan Board of Works introduced their Metropolitan Streets Improvement Bill into Parliament and at the suggestion of the Solicitor of that Board, this Vestry appointed three gentlemen thoroughly conversant with the locality, viz:—Mr. Robert Foottit, churchwarden, Col. James Payne and Mr. John Bulmer, to give evidence before the Committee of the House of Commons in support of the proposed improvement in this Parish (Union road) and to show the Committee that the thoroughfare to be improved might fairly be considered an important Metropolitan thoroughfare as distinguished from one used to a great extent by the inhabitants only of the locality. This Bill is proceeding through Parliament. The Vestry having had under consideration the scheme introduced to Parliament for the formation of a Subway commencing at the Horns Stairs in this Parish passing under the bed of the river Thames and terminating on the opposite shore in the parish of Limehouse, the following resolutions on the subject were passed by the Vestry on the 6th February, 1877, viz:— "Resolved that this Vestry believing the Limehouse Subway will prove of benefit to the inhabitants of this parish by affording increased facilities for communication between this parish and the north side of the river Thames, the Vestry approve of the scheme, subject to the insertion of certain clauses in the Bill to protect the interests ot the parish with regard to the roads, sewers, drains, &c, and that the Members of Parliament for the Borough of Southwark, be requested to give the said Bill their support during its progress through Parliament also "Resolved that the Clerks be instructed to take all necessary steps to proteft the rights of this Parish upon all points affected by the Limehouse Subway Bill with reference to roads, drains, sewers, &c., and to point out to Sir J. W. Bazelgette, Engineer to the Metropolitan Board of Works in answer to his letter of the 6th December last, the several clauses which they consider should be inserted in the Bill for the protection of this Parish, and the several objections they have to the Bill as drawn particularly the clause exempting the works and property of the proposed Company from Rates." The said Bill amended in several particulars with the clause therein proposing to exempt the property of the Company from assessment to Metropolitan, Parochiaf, and other rates struck out, is proceeding through Parliament. The Bill introduced to Parliament by the Metropolitan Board of Works entitled "The Thames River (Prevention of Floods) Bill," was considered by the Vestry at a Special Meeting called for that purpose on 22nd November, 1876, when the following resolution on the subject was made, viz:— 27 "Resolved that it be referred to the Clerks and the Surveyor of Sewers to fully consider the provisions of the said Bill, and to confer with the Metropolitan Board of Works as neccssary and relative to the expediency of inserting in the said Bill such additional powers as may be considered advisable for enabling the Vestry to protect this Parish from floods and inundations, caused not only by the overflow of the River Thames, but also by overflow from any water docks company's premises, canals, inlets from the river, or other water areas within this Parish and also for the insertion therein of such further provisions (if any) or such modifications thereof they may deem expedient" This Bill was ultimately withdrawn. In June 1876, the Vestry, on the invitation of the Board of Works for the Whitechapel District, appointed a Special Committee, consisting of Messrs. Robert Foottit and Fdwnrd lames Talbot, churchwardens, and Messrs. John Bulmcr, Henry Hayward, William Durrant, Edward John Cox, James Powell and Reuben Henry . Williams, junr.. to attend a meeting of representatives from the Vestry of St George's-in-the-Fast and of the District Boards of Limehouse, and St Olave's Southwark, to confer with reference to the question of providing a communication between the north and south sides of the River Thames, below the existing bridge called London bridge. The Committee attended seven meetings of the representatives at the office of the Whitechapel District Board of Works, Great Alice Street, K., between the 18th July, 1876, and the 6th February, 1877. A report of the result of the conference was drawn up concluding as follows.—"I hat as in th opinion of the Representatives the matter is one of vast importance to the public, the local authorities sho '11 either by combination or separately, as may be deemed better, embrace the prcs it favourable opportunity to use their utmo t endeavours to Procure the performance of a work so necessary as the construction of an efficient bridge over, or subway under the Thames at a point east of London I ridge, which woul 1 afford an advantage to the general public far beyond the freeing from toll most of the existing toll-bridges of the Thames." Doubts having arisen as to the rating qualification of Mr Reubcn Henry Williams, junr., who was elected a vestryman in May 1876, the Vestry caused the opinion of Mr. J. Morgan Howard, Q.C.. to be taken on the subject, and the following is a copy of such opinion— OPINION. 1.—1 am of opinion that within the mea ling of the authorities applicable to this question, Mr. K. H. Williams, junr.. is not legally qualified to act as a Vestryman of th' said parish pursuant to the said Act 28 2.—I am of opinion that the said Return is not final so as to preclude inquiry into Mr. Williams' qualification, or so as to protect him from liability to penalty under sec, 54. 3.— Un ler the circumstances, I think Mr, Williams must claim by notice in writing to the Overseers. 1 le may claim either in virtue of a sole or of a joint occupation according to the facts as they exist. I do not think there was any legal duty upon the Collector under the circumstances, to report to the Overseers. (Signed) J. MORGAN HOWARD. June 23rd, 1876. Mr. R. H. Williams, junr., continuing to sit and act as a vestrymen, an Action has been commenced in the Common Pleas Division of the High Court of Justice by Mr. James Robert Goodhew, a ratepayer of this parish against Mr. Williams for the penalty under the 54th section of the 18th and 19th Vic., cap. 120. (the Metropolis Local Management Act) for so acting as a vestryman without being qualified by rating as required by the said Act, and the suit is still pending. At the instance of the Committee of the National Chamber of Trade, the following gentlemen were, in December 1876. appointed as Delegates to represent this Parish at any meeting of delegates of Vestries and Dictricl. Boards upon the subject of largely increased water rates in the Metropolis, viz: Messrs. Robert Allen, Thomas William Clarke, Henry Hayward, Francis John Bisley and James Whitechurch. There having been a very high tide in the River Thames on the 2nd January, 1877, the Vestry caused notices to be served upon the Owners or Occupiers of property next the river where the tide had overflowed, requiring them to raise their wharves and premises to a height of not less than 18 feet above ordnance datum to prevent such overflow in future. Under the orders of the Metropolitan Board of Works the following places in Paradise Street, in this Parish have been re-named, viz:— New Place otherwise Camden Place, to be Donne Place." Passfields Rents otherwise Park Place, to be "Wormald Place." 29 The Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869. Under the provisions of the above Act, the total Assessment of properties in this Parish has been increased since the new valuation in 1875, as follows, viz:— Gross Value. Rateable Value. From £214,077 0s. 0d. £172,963 0s. 0d. To £230.530 0s. d. £186,493 0d. 0d.0 APPENDIX NO. 1- ANNUAL REPO&T OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. From 1st Aprils 1876 to 31 st March, 1877. THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF R0THERH1TIIE, SURREY Gentlemen, It has been my custom in these annual statements to inform you of any advance that has been made by the legislature in amending or completing our Sanitary laws, although they may be regarded as incomplete, no legal enactment of consequence has been made towards their improvement since I last addressed you; it would however be wrong to infer that this lull in sanitary legislation can last long, or that it arises from a feeling that enough has been done in this direction, to protect the health and prolong the life of this great community, but we should rather attribute it to the difficulties encountered in dealing with some of these questions, and it is probable that some sanitary matters of importance will remain legally unsettled, until the mind of the public and in some cases those engaged in administering sanitary laws, are more enlightened with respcct to the circumstances which influence epidemic diseases, the baneful effects of breathing bad air, the poisonous effects of sewer and some other gases, and the evil and demoralizing influence occasioned by living in dirty, unhealthy, and uncomfortable houses. From year to year I have brought under your notice the fatal effects of some of the most importan diseases in the zymotic class, young children are the chief sufferers, and the mortality is very high compared with the deaths occasioned by other diseases, at the time I made my former annual statement, Scarlatina was the prevailing epidemic, it was then on the decline, and may be said to have ceased about the middle of 1876, formerly I have alluded especially to the destructive effects on life produced by this disease, and expressed an opinion that isolation of the patient and better accommodation and management in the houses of the poor,, arc required to lessen its ravages. 31 As soon as Scarlatina abated, warnings arose that indicated the approach of Small Pox, and some lives succumbed to this disease; it so difficult to obtain information from Small Pox patienta relative to vaccination, that I cannot adduce trustworthy or accurate information as to the number of deaths that had occurred in vaccinated or unvaccinated persons; but there is no doubt that efficient vacccination is almost a complete protection from the disease, but that revaccination at certain intervals is necessary to add to its •ecurity. it is also unquestionable that the mortality is considerably higher in the unvaccinated, than in the rarcinated class, and that many deaths are caused by neglect of vaccination, imperfect vaccination, and the omission of revaccination; the other mischievous influences already alluded to, we doubt add to the extension of the disease and its fatal effects, viz: want of isolation of the patient, overcrowding the nick room, and to five intercourse of the patient with uninfected persons. Zymotic diseases. The table appended will explain the fluctuations and degree of fatality which have accompanied some of the most important of these diseases. During the last ten years the average annual number of deaths have been 107, and it is noteworthy that notwithstanding some increase of population and the decline of one severe epidermic disease and the activity of another, only ninety two deaths have been registered this year.

During the last ten years, ninety-nine deaths have occurred, including three cases of Typbus and fire of the Typhod type which have been registered, since my last annual report the number of fatal case* recorded for this year will then-fore be two below the aunual average. Small Pox. In mv former annual statement I mentioned that only one death had been caused by this disease within the previous three years; another epidemic has unfortunately visited us, which has occasioned twelve deaths daring the year, and the disease is still existing. Scarlatina has destroyed more lives in the last ten years than any other zymotie disease, twelve deaths have occured since my last annual return, and as the disesie was then gradually declining the present visitation 32 may be considered to have ceased, although severe the destructive effects on life have not been so great as occurred in the former epidemic. Measles. The average annual number of deaths is about twelve, during the year thirteen deaths have been registered. Whooping Cough. Less fluctuation is observed in the annual rate of mortality, in relation to this disease than is noticed in some other diseases of its class, the average number of deaths is eleven, and this year thirteen fatal cases have been registered. Diarrhœa. This disease is chiefly fiital to infants under two years of age, and prevails in July, August and September, twenty-six deaths have been registered, which is exactly the annual average for ten years. Diptheria. Only one death has been referred to this disease, in the two previous years the mortality was unusually large. Births. For several successive years there had been an increase in the number of births, but last year there was a slight decrease, amounting to seventeen, I considered this slight check to increase of population as an exceptional circumstance and that opinion is confirmed in some degree by the number of births which have been registered in the year ending March 31st, 1877; the number recorded being one thousand two hundred and sixty-seven compared with one thousand one hundred and ninety-two in the previous year, thus shewing an increase of serentyfive. Births registered during the year in quarterly divisions:— Males. Females. Total. From April 1st, 1876, to .June 30th 1876 141 157 298 ,, July 1st, 1876, to September 30th, 1876 103 138 3 1 ,, October 1st. 1876, to December 31st, 1876 153 159 312 „ January 1st, 1877, to March 31st, 1877 185 171 356 642 625 1267 Deaths. The opening of the Infirmary at Rotherhithe in connection with the St. Olaves Union, has already, and will in future considerably augment the aggregate number of registered deaths; one hundred and seven deaths occurred in the Infirmary and Workhouse in the year ending March 31st, 1877, which large addition has increased the aggregete number to seven hundred and eighteen ; six hundred and seventytwo deaths were recorded in the previous year, so that there is an apparent increase of forty-six, but I shall hereafter prove, that instead of an increase there is some diminution in the rate of mortality. 33 Deaths registered during the year in quarterly divisions:— Males. Females. Total. From April lst, 1876, to Jane 30th, 1876 96 81 177 ,, July 1st, 1876, to September 30th, 1876 93 80 173 „ October 1st, 1876, to December 31st, 1876 97 74 171 „ January 1st, 1877, to March 31st, 1877 92 105 197 378 340 718 One thousand two hundred and sixty-seven births having been registered, and one thousand one hundred and ninety-two in the previous year, a gain of seventy-five lives is obtained, and as seven hundred and eighteen deaths more recorded, there is an excess of five hundred and forty-nine births over the deaths but this statement does not accurately represent the relations of births and deaths, because in making the calculation, it is neeessary to consider that twenty-three persons upon whom Cononer's Inquests had been held, had not resided in this Parish, and also to allude to the one hundred and seven deaths which occurred in the Workhouse and Infirmary attached d to St. Olaves' Union, which comprises the Parishes of liermondsey Rothcrhithe, St- O aves' and St. John's, each of these contributed its portion of patients, and the relative distribution will be as under: — From liermondsey 52 patients. From Rotherhithe 42 „ From St. Olavess' 6 „ From St. John's 7 ,, 107 Sixty-five of these patients were consequently not inhabitants of Rotherhithe, and if we add that number to twenty-three non-parishioners upon whom Coroner'* Inquests had been held, we must substraet eigbty-eight deaths from the entire number, and the result will be that the actual numlwr of deaths is six hundred and thirty, compared with six hundred an 1 forty-five in the previous year, and the excess of births over deatha six hundred and thirty term.

The investigation of the birth rate and rate of mortality represent the former as forty per thousand, and the latter twenty per thousand. The character of the sanitary work has not much differed from that of former years, it consisted of the attempt to cause the abatement of various forms of nuisance, which will be explained in the following statement furnished by the Sanitary Inspector (Mr. Edwards). SANITARY WORK, &c„ COMPLETED IN THS YEAR ENDING MARCH 31st, 1877. Notices issued for Sanitary amendments, &c., of houses and premises, 427.
