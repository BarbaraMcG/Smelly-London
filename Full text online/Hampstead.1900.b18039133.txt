HAMP 7 1901. REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the Borough of Hampstead, FOR THE YEAR 1900. by EDMUND GWYNN, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. Town Hall, Hampstead, N.W. 25 th June, 1901. To the Council of the Borough of Hampstead. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Borough of Hampstead for the year 1900. Our population was found by the returns of the Census taken March 31st, 1901, to he 81,942, a number less than had been previously estimated. The proximity of the Easter holidays is, however, a disturbing element in this Borough, when many well-to-do inhabitants of Hampstead are from home. In the decades 1861-71, and 1871-81, the increase was over 13,000; in the decade 1881-91, we made a bound of over 22,000; but in the decade 1891-1901 this latter rate of increase was not maintained, and it fell to 13,517. If we examine the two quinquennial periods 1891-96, and 1896-1901, we shall see that a continual decrease is in progress, for whilst in the first five years we obtained over 7,000 new inhabitants, in the last five years we have only added 5,493 to our numbers. The probable explanation of these facts may be that the available building land in Hampstead is becoming much reduced in area and is increasing in value. The number of inhabited houses was 12,027 (for this purpose each occupied flat is considered to be a house) ; this gives an average of 6.7 persons per house, against an average of 7.1 persons per house for the former decade. This reduction in the average mentioned is due to the disturbing element of flat tenure, these dwellings often containing only three or four persons. 4 The number of inhabitants per acre has now risen to 36, against 30 for the preceding decade, and 23 for the decade 1871-81. For the purposes of this report it is necessary, by the directions of the Local Government Board, to estimate our population to the middle of 1900, instead of the end of the year, which may therefore be taken at that period to be 81,230. Marriages.—The number of marriages celebrated was 551, showing a decrease of 21 on the previous year. Births.—The births registered during 1900 were 1,621, an increase of 45 on the previous year. The birth rate was equal to 20. The birth rate for the Metropolis was 28.6 per thousand population, the lowest birth rate hitherto recorded in London. Deaths.—The deaths registered in the 52 weeks numbered 1,200; of these however, no less than 372 were those of non-residents who died in the various hospitals and homes in the Borough. The number of Hampstead residents who died in the Borough was 828, and to these we must add the deaths of 94 of our citizens who died in institutions outside the Borough, making a total of 922. The annual death rate will be equal to a ratio of ll.3 against 11.2 for 1899, and 11.4 for 1898. The death rate for London was 18.8, or 7.5 higher than that for Hampstead. The average death rate for the Metropolis for the last 10 years was 19 .8. Mortality at different Ages.—The deaths of children under one year were 170, and after distribution of the deaths occurring in public institutions, the incidence of infantile mortality was equivalent to 100 per 1,000 births. The Registrar-General states "The lowest proportions per 1,000 births were, 100 in Hampstead, 107 in St. George, Hanover Square, 108 in Stoke Newington; the highest proportions were 192 in Poplar, 228 in Limehouse, and 240 in Holborn." Special Causes of Death.—The deaths of parishioners from the seven principal Zymotic diseases, after correction for those of citizens who died in Hospitals outside our district, are equal to a ratio of l.03 per 1,000 living inhabitants, and rather less than that for the preceding year, which was equivalent to 119. The ratio for London was 222. The following table shows the diminution or excess of deaths in 1900 from the seven principal Zymotic diseases, 5 Causes of death 1900. 1899 Diminution in 1900.

There were only 4 deaths from Small Pox in London during 1900. Vaccination.—The number of certificates of exemptions, from conscientious objectors as to vaccination, &c., in 1900 for the Borough of Hampstead, is stated by the Vaccination Officer to be 32. Scarlet Fever.—220 cases of this disease were registered, against 285 for the previous year; 125 of these were removed to isolation hospitals, including four cases that occurred among the nursing staff of the North-Western Hospital. Our deaths from this cause were 4, or 2 less than the number recorded for 1899; the mortality was 1.8 on registered cases. Diphtheria.—153 cases of Diphtheria were notified during the year, against 106 for 1899. The fatal cases from this cause were 30, 7 equivalent to a mortality of 19 per cent, oil registered cases. The number of patients from this disease removed to isolation hospitals was 107. The death rate for Hampstead from Diphtheria per 1,000 living inhabitants was 0.38, the highest rate for the last ten years with the exception of 1892 when it was 0.39, and 1893 when it rose to 0.53. During the year, the subject of infection recurring in houses after children had returned from hospitals, was brought into notice by the numerous cases that occurred. This was also very apparent in the early part of 1901, when some fatal cases happened. I was directed to communicate with the Asylums Board, and request that the Board might bo induced to notify your Medical Officer of all cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria returning from the Managers' Hospitals to premises within our Borough. A reply was received from the Clerk of the Board to the effect that "the matter had been carefully considered by the Board and their Committee, with the result that it had not appeared that the trouble and additional expense for clerical assistance that would be involved in furnishing such information, would be proportionate to the usefulness thereof." The report of Professor Simpson on the subject of infection from returned cases stated that all due and proper precautions were taken before the children were discharged from hospitals. He was inclined to think that children took cold on returning home, causing discharges to appear from the nose and ears, by which the child again became infectious. If such indeed be the case, it might have been supposed there was all the more reason for communicating the fact of the return of the child to the local Medical Officer, that the case might be watched. Puerperal Fever.—The number of cases of this disease recorded was 5, 3 of which proved fatal. Notification of Infectious Disease.—The total number of certificates received was 373, for which the sum of £57 11s. 6d. was paid to medical practitioners. This amount is recouped to the Council, by the Asylums Board out of the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund. The total number of cases removed to fever hospitals for treatment was 260. Influenza was the registered cause of 36 deaths, the disease being particularly fatal in January. The deaths referred to Influenza in 8 London during 1900 numbered 1,950, which is the highest number recorded since 1895. Phthisis.—The deaths from Consumption numbered 69, and show a fall on those reported for the preceding year, when they numbered 81. The Phthisis death rate is stated by the Registrar-General to be l.75 per 1,000 for 1900, for the Metropolis, as compared with a rate of 1.77 and 1.88 in the two preceding years. The death rate ranged from 0.85 in Hampstead, to 2.85 in Holborn, and even 3.26 in St. George-theMartyr in Southwark. Measles was the cause of 21 deaths, against 22 for 1899, and was epidemic up to August, when the disease passed over. Whooping Cough caused 9 deaths, against 11 for the preceding year. Enteric or Typhoid Fever.—The total number of cases registered was 49, against 41 for 1899, and 49 for 1898. Of the 9 deaths from this cause, 5 took place in the Borough and 4 in places outside our borders. Diarrhœa was returned as the cause of 22 deaths, against 39 for the preceding year, and most of these occurred in the summer and autumn quarters. The relation of the diarrhœal death rate, to the condition of a district with respect to its scavengering has been pointed out, it having been noticed that where the streets are kept well cleansed and the house refuse is promptly removed, the diarrhœal death rate is low. Erysipelas.—49 cases of this disease were registered during the year, attended by one fatal result. Ambulance Service.—The Metropolitan Asylums Board, under the powers conferred upon them by Sec. 6 of the Poor Law Act, 1889, now allow their Ambulances to be used for the removal of persons suffering from infectious diseases, to places other than the Board's hospitals. The charge to be made for each conveyance is 5s., but this charge may be remitted when deemed necessary by the Ambulance Committee. The practice of knowingly making use of a public vehicle, cab, omnibus, or railway carriage, for the conveyance of any person suffering from a 9 dangerous infectious disorder, should now be discontinued, as both unnecessary and unjustifiable. On June 18th, 1901, Mrs. X appeared before the Public Health Committee in explanation of her conduct in removing a child suffering from Scarlet Fever, who was in her charge, from Hampstead to another part in a hansom cab, without the driver of the cab being informed of the nature of the disease. By resolution of the Committee, Mrs. X was severely cautioned by the Chairman of the Committee. Local Diseases.—Diseases of the respiratory organs, which include Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and Pleurisy, caused 137 deaths. Whilst the deaths from this cause were on the whole less by 14 than those for the preceding year, the large increase of deaths from Pneumonia points to the influence of the epidemic of Influenza in the early part of the year on the respiratory organs. Diseases of the nervous system caused 83 deaths, including 17 from Convulsions. Deaths from Apoplexy, Paralysis, and Epilepsy, are ncluded in this class. Diseases of the Heart and Circulatory system, caused 109 deaths, diseases of the digestive organs, which include affections of the liver and bowels, &c., caused 42 ; of these, 7 were due to Diabetes; 4 to Cirrhosis of the liver, frequently connected with drinking habits; and 5 to Alcoholism, including Delirium Tremens. Kidney and Urinary troubles caused 35 deaths, whilst locomotory and integumentary diseases were each responsible for 5 deaths. Constitutional Diseases.—This important class comprises the causes of 164 deaths, of which 8 were due to Gout and Rheumatism; 69 to Cancer, and 87 to Phthisis and its allied diseases. The deaths from Cancer show an increase of 10 over the preceding year. This is one of the diseases of modern life which seems to be steadily increasing. From the Registrar-General's returns, it would seem that the mortality from this cause has for many years been greatly and uninterruptedly rising. It is generally admitted that the tendency 10 to Cancer is hereditary, but even when disclosed, the fact does not appear to be considered as a bar to marriage. The deaths from Tuberculous diseases, also included in this class, comprise Tabes Mesenterica or Consumption of the bowels 12; Tubercular Meningitis and Hydrocephalus (water on the brain) 6; Consumption (parishioners only), including 8 who died in outlying Institutions, 69. Inquests.—The number of inquests held was 70, the deaths in 37 instances being caused by violence; 4 infants perished by suffocation when in bed with mother. Of the ten cases of suicide, death was caused by drowning, by bullet wounds, by falls from windows, by wounds in throat, and in two instances by poisoning with Carbolic Acid, one of the most easily obtained poisons. The death of a child was caused by impaction of food in the windpipe, and in the case of a wife, aged 47, by cocaine poisoning, by misadventure. Mortuary.—The total number of bodies received during the year was 82, an increase of 5 on the previous year; 56 of these were admitted by the Coroner's order, 16 were brought in by the Police, and 10 at the request of friends and relatives. The number of post-mortem examinations made was 39. It may be of interest to state that the Mortuary at New End Hampstead, was first opened in February, 1891. The building contains two chambers, one for infectious bodies, and one for non-infectious bodies. The room for the post-mortem examinations is convenient and well adapted for the purposes for which it was designed, and much satisfaction has been expressed by the Medical men who have been failed on to make such examinations. The number of bodies brought in by relatives is rising but very slowly, and it is to be regretted that the public has not yet learnt to make sufficient use of the Mortuary as a place of deposit for the bodies of those awaiting interment, and especially that portion of the public that is without proper accommodation for the retention of dead bodies in their homes. By Sec. 8 of the Infectious Diseases Prevention Act (1890), it is provided that after death from an infectious disease, a body may not 11 be retained elsewhere than in a public mortuary or in a room not used at the time as a dwelling place, sleeping place, or workroom, for more than 48 hours, without the sanction in writing of the Medical Officer of Health, or of a registered medical practitioner. By Sec. 9 of the same Act, "where any body is retained in a house so as to endanger the health of the inmates, any justice may, on the application of the Medical Officer of Health, order the body to be removed to any available mortuary, and direct the same to be buried." Work of the Public Health Department.—Table No. IV. contains full details of the work carried out by the District Inspectors. 3,100 inspections of houses and premises were made during the year, and 5,749 re-inspections were made after order or notice had been served; 489 orders were made for the cleansing, whitewashing and repair of houses; 302 for the repair, 141 for the ventilating, and 289 for the re-construction of house drains; 308 waterclosets were repaired or cleansed, 60 ventilated, and 268 provided with new pans and apparatus; 50 dustbins were repaired or covered, and 105 new receptacles provided. The paving of yards in the vicinity of the house is a subject of considerable sanitary importance; 147 notices were served in the year for the repairs of pavements, and in 36 instances to be renewed entirely. Cisterns came in for notice, 270 were ordered to be cleansed, repaired, and recovered, and 18 new to be provided Animals, chiefly poultry, were found to be improperly kept in 16 oases. For the removal of refuse and dung no less than 454 notices and orders were required; 15 dung receptacles were re-constructed or new provided. The number of applications to examine the drainage of private houses was 120, rather less than in previous years. The total number of complaints received during the year was 240, an increase of 8 on the preceding year. The total number of notices served for sanitary defects was 1,123; of these 859 were cautionary, and 361 statutory notices of intention to proceed. 12 The number of legal proceedings was 20, the same as last year, all of which were successful. It may be added that owners generally do what is necessary upon receipt of the preliminary or intimation notice. Statutory notices arc issued by the Public Health Committee, who are empowered by the Council to act as the Sanitary Authority in connection with the carrying out of the Public Health Acts. Slaughterhouses.—The annual inspection of these premises by the Public Health Committee took place on October 9th. Their number has now sunk to 5, and they were found to be in good order. The question of establishing public abattoirs for the Metropolis appears to have been abandoned for the moment, but there is good reason for thinking that tuberculous meat might be almost completely excluded from our markets if the slaughtering of cattle were conducted in public abattoirs and under proper inspection. Bakehouses.—The 39 bakehouses were regularly inspected with reference to their cleanliness, ventilation, water supply, drainage, &c. Workshops.—Table No. 5 contains a list of workshops inspected, with the result that 58 workshops were ordered to be cleansed and whitewashed ; 6 closets to be repaired, &c.; overcrowding was abated in 2 instances. Overcrowding.—Only 4 cases of overcrowding were detected during the year, against 10 for the preceding year, and 15 for 1898. This subject has been further dealt with in a special report on the house to house inspection, undertaken May to June, 1901, during which period 2,932 houses were examined by a staff of seven temporary inspectors appointed for the purpose. Disinfection.—The number of houses disinfected after infectious disease was 467. The total number of articles disinfected was 8,154, an increase on previous years. Day Shelter.—In accordance with the requirements of Sec. 60 (4), of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, a temporary shelter shall be provided by the sanitary authority for the accommodation of families who have been compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of 13 Laving such dwellings disinfected. A shelter, with day accommodation for two families, was provided by the late Vestry in 1892. This building was taken over by the Electric Lighting Department in 1900, since which period the Borough has been without a day shelter. Although the class for whom the accommodation was provided made very little use of the shelter, to comply with the Act will necessitate the election of these premises on some suitable spot. The question also of providing housing accommodation for the officers employed as disinfectors might bo considered at the same time. Unwholesome Food.—The Inspectors have continued to visit the markets on Saturday nights in order to prevent the sale of stale or unwholesome food. Twenty-three pieces of bacon were seized by Inspectors Hudson and Leverton on one of these occasions from a stall in High Road, Kilburn, and were submitted to me and found to be unfit for consumption. The bacon was subsequently condemned by the Magistrate and ordered to be destroyed. Stale and preserved fruits in tins, stale groceries, &c., were also seized during the year. Samples of Milk for analysis have been taken at Stations, Public Institutions, Hospitals, &c., and on Sunday mornings in the streets, in addition to those taken in the ordinary course in shops. The food of children under one year of age is largely composed of milk, and the milk of cows sometimes contains the tubercle bacillus. Cows are subject not merely to tubercle of the lungs, but also to tubercle of the udder. When tuberculous milk is ingested by children it is apt to affect the mesenteric glands, and produce the disease known as consumption of the bowels. Milk may also be the medium for the conveyance of the poisons of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. It is stated that the British are the only civilized people who habitually consume raw milk. It cannot be too often repeated that to destroy the tubercle bacillus and other poisonous germs in milk, it is only necessary to boil the milk for a few minutes, or, for those who dislike the flavour of boiled milk, the same object can be attained by sterilizing the milk by raising the temperature to 160 degrees, and maintaining it at that heat for 30 or 40 minutes, and allowing it to cool gradually. 14 Special Reports were issued during the year on various subjects, and a special memorandum addressed to every medical practitioner respecting Plague. A General Sanitary Notice was sent to every householder in October pointing out the necessity for the periodical inspection and cleansing of all disconnecting chambers on their system of drainage, and for seeing to the thorough flushing out of all syphon traps and drains on the premises; attention at the same time was called to the necessity for the cleansing of cisterns, and the preventing of accumulations of vegetable and animal matters, with garden refuse, &c., in dustbins. In closing my last Annual Report, I take the opportunity of bearing testimony to the valuable and efficient assistance I have received from Mr. G. A. Smith, the Senior Sanitary Assistant; to Mr. Leverton and the other three Inspectors, who have carried out their arduous and frequently unpleasant duties with judgment and success; nor should the services of the Clerical Staff be overlooked, seeing that their work has been very much increased lately by the additions to the number of the Sanitary Inspectors. Whilst thanking the various Borough Officials for the assistance and information afforded me in past years, I beg at the same time to gratefully acknowledge the valuable assistance I have received from the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee, and for the uniform support afforded me not only by the late Vestry, but also by the Mayor and Members of the present Borough Council. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, EDMUND GWYNN, Acting Medical Officer of Health. Table No. I.
