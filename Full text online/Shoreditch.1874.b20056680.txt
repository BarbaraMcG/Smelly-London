METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT, 1855. NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT, for the YEAR ENDING MARCH 25TH, 1875. PUBLISHED PURSUANT TO THE 18 & 19 VIC, CAP- 120. LONDON: ANDREW T. ROBERTS, STEAM PRINTING WORKS, 5, HACKNEY ROAD. 1875. A REPORT Or the Receipts and Expenditure, Assets and Liabilities of the Vestry of the Parish of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch, and of the proceedings of the Vestry, and of the works undertaken and executed, &c., for the year ending Ladyday, 1875. Published pursuant to the "Metropolis Local Management Act," 1855. N. B.—The Medical Officers and Sanitary Reports will be issued separately. report of the yestry clerk. Gentlemen, During the year ending Lady-day, 1875, the amount collected on the Poor's Rate was £62,006 5s. 7d.; the amount in the pound levied for the four quarters was 2s. 5d., being for the quarter to Midsummer, 1874, 8d.; to Michaelmas 9d.; to Christmas 7d.; and to Lady-day, 1875, 5d. The gross amount levied was £63,512, from which has to be deducted losses from defaulters, excused, vacant premises, and allowances to owners, which, for this year, is equal in all to about 8 per cent. of the gross amount charged. A portion of the amount collected this year is upon rates previously made. It will thus be seen that the Poor Rate was 6d. less this year than in the previous year, and the reduction was made mainly in the two last quarters. It was effected by absorbing for current expenses the accumulated balances of former quarters, which had been rendered necessary to compensate for outstanding Rates hitherto not available for current purposes. The most satisfactory feature in this year's parochial work is the great improvement which has been effected in the collection of the Rates. The Poor Law Auditor, Mr. Lloyd Roberts, in auditing the accounts for the half year ending Lady-day, 1874, complained of the backward state of the Collection, and intimated that in future the Rates must be virtually collected within the period for which they were made. The Vestry resolved to give effect to this suggestion, and it has been accomplished to a degree beyond expectation. On the 18th of April, 6 1874, the amount outstanding on rates made at the previous Christmas, or before, was £8499, or nearly 51 per cent. of the rate. On the 20th of April, 1875, there were not £20 arrears. There has therefore been an improvement in the collection, as regards time, of upwards of 50 per cent. in one year, and in the course of two years of upwards of one hundred per cent. The losses from removals, empty houses, etc., for the year ending Lady-day, 1874, amounted to 3.44 per cent. of the entire rate ; for the quarter ending Lady-day, 1875, the proportion was 2.45 per cent. Much of this loss arises from ratepayers leaving the premises and the rates unpaid for the previous quarters. As the total rates levied for the year were £104,164 this reduction of the loss of one per cent. means a saving to those ratepayers who remain in the parish and contribute regularly, of £1000 for the year. This improvement is mainly due to the firmness and resolution with which the Finance Committee grappled with the question and encouraged the efforts of the Officers, and to the ready and efficient cooperation of the Rate Collectors; and, although difficulty was no doubt felt in some cases in paying up arrears, there is no reason to believe that any undue pressure has been put upon the ratepayers. The amount of the Guardians' Calls for the year ending Lady-day, 1874, was £38,500; and for the last year £38,000; and for the halfyear, Lady-day to Michaelmas, 1875, is £16,000. The amount owing to the Guardians at Lady-day, 1874, was £7000 or two month's instalments; at Lady-day last it was £3000; and there was cash in hand to meet it. Further particulars of the expenditure of Poor Rate will be found in the Balance Sheet given with the Accountant's Report. SEWERS AND GENERAL RATES. Tho Accountant's statement hereto appended will give the details of the receipts and expenditure on account of the Sewers and General Rates. It is only necessary here to state that the rates levied for the last two years were 1874 1875 General in the £ 1/6 1/7 Sewers ditto 4d. 7d. 7 ASSESSMENTS. The Provisional and Supplemental Valuation Lists for the year have been duly prepared, and the totals for the present year are fixed at £552.740 10s. gross value, and £111,020 rateable value. For the previous year the amounts were: Gross value, £361,817; Rateable value, £448,272. The totals for the Metropolitan District are, gross value £25,728,835, and the rateable value £21,139,843, subject to appeals pending. It is upon the total rateable value that the Police, County, Metropolitan Board's, School Board's, and other charges are leviod. The reduction in the totals for this parish is owing to the large amount of property taken down or closed for Metropolitan Improvements. The Valuation List Committee has been actively engaged for some time in revising the assessments preparatory to the remaking of the entire Valuation List in the course of the current year. About 17,000 forms of returns supplied by Government have been issued to owners and occupiers as tho law requires. The assistance of Messrs. Castle was called in for the valuation of Gas, Water, and Railway Companies, and of Messrs. Harston for the Tramway Company, and the List was deposited by the 1 st of May. Notices have been issued to all ratepayers and compounding owners of the amount of their assessments, and tho Lists are now awaiting revision by the Assessment Committee. A summary of the alterations effected on the assessment of the parish must be postponed till next year, as the revision of the Lists, even without appeals to the Sessions, cannot be completed until the end of October. /* TRAMWAYS. The transactions with the North Metropolitan Tramway Company in respect to payments for paving, and the charges for new paving have been closed. The Company paid a total sum of £8,300 for the use of old paving, and for a part of the extra paving in Bridport Place, and have laid down paving at their own chargo in Mintern Street, Bridport Place, Kingsland Road, &c., equal in value to about £3,000. The lines are assessed at £630 for the present year, but in the New Valuation List the rateable value will be £2,000. A dispute arose between the Vestry and the Tramway Company in 8 respect to the mode adopted by the latter for cleansing the grooves of tho rails. The practice in some streets was to take the mud from the grooves and lay it on the carriage way in heaps, where it became a nuisance. This led to proceedings at the Police Court, which ended in a conviction. The Company applied for a case for the consideration of the Queen's Bench, which was granted. On the hearing of the same the conviction was affirmed with costs. The practice will therefore probably cease. RAILWAYS, &c. No new powers have been applied for in the present Session in respect to Railway or other Companies, but the agreement between tho North London Railway and London and North Western Companies and the Vestry relative to the widening of Worship Street, &c., has been carried out, and the Vestry has agreed to construct the Sewers through the diverted portion of Finsbury Avenue and to pave the surface, the Railway Company paying the cost. PROPOSED NEW STREET FROM WORSHIP STREET TO SUN STREET. The Vestry has engaged Mr. Robert Walker, Architect, to prepare plans and estimates for a new thoroughfare from Worship Street, opposite to Curtain Road, to Sun Street, with a view of submitting the same to the Metropolitan Board of Works. MORTUARY. The preliminary arrangements between the Vicar of the Parish and the Vestry, respecting the erection of a Mortuary in the Parish Church Yard, are nearly completed, and there is some prospect that this necessary convenience will shortly be provided. DISORDERLY HOUSES. Although I have issued warnings to several persons complained of for keeping improper houses, which for the most part have had effect, I have not found it necessary during the past year to take proceedings against any offenders. 9 REMOVAL OF DUST. In February last a considerable number of complaints were made of the difficulty of getting the dust removed, (as, indeed, there always are in the Winter seasons), and the Vestry directed proceedings to be taken at the Police Court to recover the penalties provided by the Statute. Thirteen summonses were taken out and, as far as they were heard, were proved, and the Magistrate inflicted fines in three cases of £5 each. The Vestry has now adopted a system of providing each house with a letter "D" for exhibition in the window, with a notification that the dust cart will collect in the street on two specified days in each week. The system appears at present to work satisfactorily, but it has not been tried long enough to enable a positive opinion to be given, and the real test will be, as always, the Winter. Should the Vestry continue the contracting system, it is worthy of consideration whether it would not be better, as has been suggested, to make the contract year terminate at Michaelmas instead of Lady-day, by which arrangement the constant complaint by new contractors of having to remove large accumulations of winters' dust would be avoided. It is also a question whether a contract for three years instead of one would not be mutually advantageous to both parties, as it would certainly justify the contractor in providing a more efficient plant with a lengthened period before him to use it. ADULTERATION OF FOOD. Appended are the reports of Dr. Stevenson, the Analyst for the year. Prosecutions were taken against two persons for selling coffee adulterated with nearly three parts of chicory, but convictions were not obtained because, although the adulterations were considerable, the wrappers bore a statement that the article sold was a mixture. Convictions were obtained against two persons selling milk. One of the cases was in respect to milk sold in the street in this Parish, the vendor living in another parish. The Bill introduced by the Government to amend the law indicated such important alterations that it was considered better to await its final passing before submitting more samples. The whole question of executing the new Act when passed must receive further consideration. 10 THE TOWN HALL. During the year the Largo Hall has Loon let 147 times; the Council Chamber 22 times; the Committee Rooms have boon frequently used by Local Societies, mostly free of charge. Tho receipts for lotting wore £1,074 13s. 6d. VESTRY X COMMITTEE MEETINGS.

I have the honor to bo, Gentlemen, Your obodient Servant, E. WALKER, Vestry Clerk. Town Hall, Old Street, June, 1875. 11 Report Of The Accountant. To the Vestry of St. Leonard Shoreditch Gentlemen, I beg herewith to submit for the information of the Vestry the annexed statement of receipts and disbursements for the year ending on the 25th March, 1875, and, on reference thereto, it will be seen that the amount raised during the year by Poor and Vestry rates alone amounted to the sum of £112,927 0s. 2d.; there being a balance in the hands of the Treasurer of receipts over expenditure on the Poor rate of £7,905 19s. 0d., and on the Vestry rates of 8,429 3s. 9d. to bo carried forward to the account of the next financial year. In the statement of the rates collected, the actual deficiency from arrears, losses, &c., upon one year's assessment was £8,784 5s. 7d., being a loss of about £7 15s. 3d. per cent., which is arrived at by deducting the amount collected from the first charge of the assessment. It may be further stated that a rate of one penny in the pound on the amount, to Lady-day, 1875, now finally closed, produced £1,(24 8s. l1d, which is doubtless attributable to the system, now being carried out, of a more speedy mode of collection,—hence the marked reduction of losses, and which is clearly proved to be beneficial to the resident ratepayers of the Parish, the ultimate intention being to have the rate collected during the quarter for which it is made, and ratepavers 12 to pay during their occupation, by which a check, to some extent, is made upon those who would leave after a few months tenancy without contributing to the parochial exchequer; the effect being that the local taxation will become more equally distributed. The further classified statements appended, to which I beg to refer, give a general view of the financial affairs of the Parish. 1 remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. E.

Analyst's Report for the Quarter ending June 24th, 1874. (35 & 36 Vic., cap. 74). % 21, Caversham Road, London, N.W. June 24th, 1874. To the Vestry of Shoreditch. Gentlemen, During the Quarter ending June 24th, 1874, the Inspector submitted 16 samples to me for analysis. All were duly analysed by me. Five of the articles were coffee. Of these three were genuine, and two contained chicory. The amount of chicory in the samples was very large, viz., 70 and 75 per cent. respectively. Eleven of the samples were of tea. None of these were, in my opinion, adulterated. The teas were mostly black, with a minute quantity of green in a few of the samples. The green tea in the samples was faced with a small portion of inert mineral matter, but not so as to be injurious to the health of those drinking an infusion of the tea. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, THOMAS STEVENSON, Analyst. 18 Analyst's Report for the Quarter ending Sept. 29th, 1874. (35 & 36 Vic., cap. 74). 21, Caversham Road, London, N.W. September 30th, 1874. To the Vestry of Shoreditch. Gentlemen, During the Quarter ending September 29th, 1874, fourteen articles of food and drink were submitted to me for analysis by the Inspectors; and the articles Were all duly analysed by me, with the following results:— Nature of Articles. No. of Adulterated or Impure Articles No. of Articles not Adulterated Totals. Milk 3 1 4 Black Tea 0 3 3 Green Tea 2 0 2 Coffee 0 3 3 Butter 0 2 2 Total 5 9 14 Of the adulterated milks one contained 33 per cent. of added water, and the two others were deprived of cream. The two specimens of green tea were faced—one with a minute quantity of Prussian Blue; the other with the same substance, and with a white micaceous inert powder also. In neither case was the infused tea likely, in my opinion, to be injurious to the health of persons drinking the same. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, THOMAS STEVENSON, Analyst for the Parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. 19 Analyst's Report for the Quarter ending December 25tii, 1874 (35 & 36 Vic., cap. 74). 21, Caversham Road, London, N.W.

These were bad cases of adulteration. The sample of green tea was faced with Prussian Blue and inert mineral matter. The facing matter was small in quantity. No adulterant was detected injurious to the health of the consumer. / I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, THOMAS STEVENSON, Analyst for the Parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. 20 Analyst's Report for the Quarter ending March 25th, 1875.
