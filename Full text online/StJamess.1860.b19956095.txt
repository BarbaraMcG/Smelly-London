JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER, IN THE YEAR 1860-61. b To the Vestry of St. James's, Westminster. 13th June, 1861. Gentlemen, In accordance with your instructions, I have prepared a condensed List of the Principal Works executed by the Vestry during the past year, from 25th March, 1860, to 25th March, 1861. The list, as you will perceive, is a very short one, owing to the small number of absolute works undertaken during that period, the workmen employed by the Vestry having been engaged almost exclusively in small repairs, a detailed account of which would fill a volume in itself, also in following up and making good the various portions of paved surfaces disturbed by the Gas and Water Companies, many of which require a great amount of attention and several times relaying. I have simply stated the gross number of separate places disturbed, though some, in fact many, places entered as one opening, in reality have been perhaps two or three, but, to xii avoid confusion, if in front of one house, they are added together, and entered as one only. The circumstances under which the carriageway of Regent Street has been maintained are so familiar, not only to the Vestry, but to the public at large, that it would be superfluous and out of place for me to enter upon it here, as I could add nothing to the information already in your possession. A paved footway has been formed round the enclosure in Golden Square, in process of which various alterations in the carriageway, channels, gullies, &c. &c. were rendered imperative, and which will prove a permanent improvement. The only other work of any magnitude undertaken and executed is the relaying a portion of the carriageway in front of Burlington House, in Piccadilly, and which appears at present to have been satisfactorily performed, and will no doubt last for some years. The works in the sewerage department have been almost equally slight. The piece of new sewer, under the house No. 23, Sherrard Street, was rendered imperative from the dangerous state of the old one, and was not undertaken without mature deliberation by the Works Committee, who visited the spot, and satisfied themselves that the work was essential. The other works mentioned in the list speak for themselves. The sewers that have been repaired were in an extremely dilapidated state, especially as regards the inverts, and the xiii brickwork round the mouths of the old drains ; and this class of work generally, from the confined and cramped position in which men are obliged to work, is necessarily tedious and expensive. On the whole, the Vestry have cause to congratulate themselves that, with the exception of positions that cannot be improved without great and almost needless expense, the whole of the Parish is satisfactorily drained, and perhaps in as good working order, if not better, than any corresponding district. A great number of gullies have been cleansed, not only by the Contractor, but the flushers employed by the "Vestry, who have also relieved a great many impeded drains, where they could be reached from the sewer, and generally rendered every assistance to the inhabitants, who have had the misfortune from stoppages in their drains. Referring to the subject of urinals, it will be seen that the Works Committee have not been idle ; the few that there are in the Parish have been always carefully attended to, and nothing left undone that, in their opinion, ought to be fairly done, to render these necessary evils as little objectionable as possible. It must be borne in mind that these alterations, slight as the space they occupy in writing, have all been the subject of much deliberation, as is also the case with the various other items mentioned, and which the records of the proceedings of the Works Committee will shew. Two new lamps have been added to those xiv formerly existing, one in Duke Street, and one at the corner of Brewer Street and Lower John Street, where they were considered to be much needed. The lamp in Glasshouse Street has also been removed, and replaced by a new lamp and brackets. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Yours most obediently, A. P. HOWELL.

F.L.S. MEMBER OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS; MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR ST. JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER; SCIENTIFIC SUPERINTENDENT AT THE SOUTH KENSINGTON MUSEUM. A TO THE VESTRY OF The Parish of St. James's, Westminster, Reverend Sir, My Lord, and Gentlemen, In the present Report I beg to bring before you the following Tables and Documents:— 1. A Table of the Causes of Death in the Parish of St. James's, Westminster, extending from the week beginning December 31st, 1859, to the week ending December 29th, 1860. 2. A Report of the Sanitary Inspector's work for the year 1860. 3. A list of houses drained and drains repaired by order of the Medical Officer of Health, and carried out under the direction of the Sanitary Inspector during the year 1860. 4. A summary of nuisances removed from the 14th of July, 1856, to the 31st of December, 1860. It would not be proper, nor in accordance with the spirit of the Act under which I hold my appointment as Medical Officer of Health, that I should neglect this opportunity of making some remarks on the practical results laid before you in these Tables, and the inferences to be drawn from 4 them with regard to the most important function you have to discharge, which is the care of the public health. I would then draw your attention, in the first place, to the disease and death which occurred in your Parish in the year 1860; and, in the second, to the measures I have taken for the purpose of preventing their extension and diminishing their intensity. In the first place I would call your attention to the gross mortality for the year 1860. I find the deaths from all causes amount to 723. In 1859 they amounted to 764, so that the saving of life in the year, as compared with 1859, is 41. Although there is this considerable difference between the two years, the death rate is nevertheless above the average. The following Table will give you the death of the last five years:— 1856 682 1857 712 1858 669 1859 764 1860 723 3550 The average death of the five years is 710, so that the past year has slightly exceeded the average of the quinquennial period from 1856 to 1860 inclusive. But in order that you may see how greatly the health of the Parish has improved, or disease and death diminished in the last five years, I present 5 you with the death in the two preceding quinquennial periods:— Deaths in the Parish of St. James, Westminster, from 1846 to 1850 inclusive, 3770 Average annual death of the period, 774 Deaths in the Parish of St. James, Westminster, from 1851 to 1855 inclusive, 4123 Average annual death, 824 Thus you will see that the average death rate of the Parish has been reduced since the introduction of the Metropolitan Management Act from 824 to 710. This is a highly favourable result, and one that could hardly have been anticipated by the most sanguine supporters of that great act of sanitary legislation. The next point of importance to which I would allude as brought out by these Tables, is the age at which people die. Connected with this is another interesting point, and that is the time of the year at which people die. In order to present these points, I have summarised the facts from my general Tables, in the following form :— 1856. First. Quarter. Second Quarter. Third Quarter. Fourth Quarter. Total.

The question of greatest interest that arises on these Tables, is the proportion of persons who die at particular ages, to the number of persons living at that age. Now there are various circumstances affecting the ages of a population. It may be that a locality is favourable to young married people with large families, and in such a population there would of necessity be a larger amount of death among children than if the population was favourable to the occupations pursued by young unmarried men and women. It is on this account that it becomes necessary to know the ages of people living in a particular district, and whether they are married or not, to come to any definite conclusions with regard to the relative mortality at particular periods of life. It is on this ground that I hesitate to accept as conclusive the result which has been arrived at by Dr. W. T. Gardiner, in a Paper, read before the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science, at its last meeting at Glasgow, in 1860. In this Paper he shews that the mortality of infants, at the age of one year and under, as compared with the death rate of the general population, is greater at the West End of London than in any other part of the country. Referring to our own Parish, he says, " St. James, 8 " Westminster, has an infantile death rate almost " precisely corresponding to that of the river " district of St. George-in-the-East, and exceeding " that of Poplar, Clerkenwell, and Bethnal Green." On the data on which he has proceeded, this is undoubtedly true; but I would remind you that this conclusion has been arrived at from the estimate of the number of infants living in the Parish in 1841, and that from the uncertainty of ascertaining the age of infants at one year and under, the Registrar-General did not estimate the children living at one year and under in 1857. I would also observe, that children are often registered as "one year" old, whether they are a few weeks older or younger, and this may lead to erroneous conclusions. I think, however, we may fairly estimate the number of children living at one year old by the number born. In the year 1860 this was 910, and from our Tables we find that 183 children are registered as having died in the same year. This mortality would give us 20 in the 100, instead of the 21 calculated by Dr. Gardiner; and our infant mortality would from this appear to be this year slightly improved. In the three previous years our average infantile death rate to the general death was as 1 in 10, or very nearly approaching Dr. Gardiner's estimate. The influence of season on death is illustrated by the above Tables. For instance, we find that for the last four years, whilst the deaths have been 210, 213, and 205 respectively for the first, second, 9 and third quarters of the year for infants, that they have been but 169 for the autumn or fourth quarter. We may find an explanation of this in the fact that the most fatal diseases of childhood—hooping cough and diarrhoea—prevail in the winter, spring, and summer quarters. If we take the death of the whole population for the last five years, we find that the healthiest quarters are the winter and the summer, whilst the spring and the autumn are the most fatal to adults. From the ages at which our population die, and the seasons which are most fatal, we may ascertain from the Tables the particular causes of death, or the diseases which produce death. The group of zymotic diseases are those which are more particularly interesting from a sanitary point of view, as they are more obviously under human control. At the same time I would reiterate what I have before said on this point, that all diseases which carry men off before they have attained mature old age, are the result of ignorance of the laws of health on the part of those who suffer, and might be prevented, were persons to live in accordance with the known laws of their physical existence. Diseases of the lungs, the heart, and the brain, could as easily be prevented, if people knew their causes and acted on their knowledge, as typhus plague, cholera, small pox, or any other preventible disease. As, however, the causes of zymotic diseases are more tangible and more easily dealt with than those of other diseases, 10 I present a summary of them as they have occurred in the Parish during the past six years. 1855.

The death from these diseases last year was, therefore, highly favourable. In the year 1860 the greatest death occurred from hooping cough, which shews a larger number than any year since 1855; whilst a smaller number of deaths occurred in this year from diarrhoea and measles than in any of the preceding five years. Scarlet fever also came off fewer than in any of the five preceding years, except 1857. In my periodical Reports I have often expressed the conviction, that if more care was taken in preventing the contact of uninfected persons with those 12 who have measles and scarlet fever, that these diseases would prove loss destructive of life. I have especially observed with regard to the latter disease, that it. is spread by the practice of sending children to school from the midst of families in which this disease exists. I have, however, been misunderstood on this point, and I would here state that I do not attribute the occurrence of this disease to the unsanitary state of schools, but to the practice above alluded to, of sending children to school from infected families. It would, I think, be a good rule in all public day schools, that no child should be allowed to attend from families in which either measles or scarlet fever exist. I think, too, with the undoubted evidence that exists, that hooping cough is a communicable disease, that children with this disease should not be sent to school. At the latter end of 1859 we were threatened with an epidemic of small pox, and in my Report of last year I reported the steps that had been taken to arrest the progress of the disease in our Parish. In 1859 but four fatal cases of this disease occurred amongst us, and only four in 1860, so that we have every reason to conclude that the efforts which were then made were successful. In 1859 the number of cases of death from small pox in the whole Metropolis was 1156, and in 1860 it was 870. If the mortality in St. James's had boon the same as that of the Metropolis, in proportion to population, our deaths ought to have been 25 for the two years, 1859-60, instead of 8. When we remember, 13 too, that one district of our Parish is one of the most thickly populated in London, and therefore most favourable to the propagation of zymotic diseases, our escape from a heavier mortality must be regarded as a matter for congratulation. As the earlier part of the year 1860 was principally occupied in taking measures for the prevention of the spread of small pox, I will subjoin the account of my proceedings, as I reported them to the fortnightly meetings of Vestry. January 26th.—" Since my last Report, a case of small pox has occurred in Heddon Street, but of an exceedingly mild character, and no other cases have occurred in the neighbourhood. At the last meeting of the Sanitary Committee, it was determined that for the present, the Sanitary Inspector should devote his time entirely to looking up cases of unvaccinated children; and I have now to report, that under this arrangement Mr. Morgan is devoting all his time to this work. Up to the present time 2G9 cases have been discovered unvaccinated, and 138 of these have been ascertained to be vaccinated. As the Schools have now all assembled, I have issued a letter to the Secretaries requesting permission to examine the children, to ascertain the names and addresses of those who are unvaccinated." February 9th.—" The case of small pox which occurred at 29, Marshall Street, seems to have been imported into the Parish from an adjoining district. Such cases indicate the necessity of simultaneous action in the Parishes of London, as it is impossible 14 to keep down the disease in one Parish by the utmost vigilance unless surrounding Parishes are equally careful. I think such a question as this of suppressing small pox might be made the subject of discussion between neighbouring Parishes, for the purposes of mutual protection. The Sanitary Inspector has continued his work of inspection, and I have obtained leave to examine the children of the schools of the Parish with one exception. The Rev. Harry Jones was anxious to give notice to the parents of the children attending the new school in St. Luke's district before he could give his consent for their examination. During the past week I have examined the children in the infants' school in Dufour's Place, the infant, boys and girls schools at Craven Chapel, and the infant school in Marshall Street, making altogether 477 children. Amongst these children 31 were found unvaccinated, or with the marks so feeble, that I recommended them to be revaccinated. The question of revaccination is constantly coming up, and I would state my opinion that such a practice is not only free from objection, but that in a certain number of cases, it is as great a safeguard against small pox as the original vaccination. It has been proved by extensive experiments in the Prussian army, and other large bodies of men, that those who are revaccinated, are less liable to the disease than those who have not undergone this operation. Whether this arises from vaccination being originally ineffectually performed, or an exceptional 15 tendency to take the disease of small pox, cannot be ascertained. It is, however, most probable that a variety of causes may prevent a first vaccination being perfectly successful, and thus individuals become liable to small pox. The indications of unsuccessful vaccination are not always evident, as persons with good marks on their arms may take small pox, and those with feeble marks may be protected from the disease. The number of cases of unvaccinated children found in the Parish up to this time is 347, and the number of those thus discovered who have been known to have been vaccinated is 160." February 23rd.—" I have to record the occurrence of another case of small pox since may last Report. The case has been removed to the hospital, and I have no knowledge of the existence of another case anywhere at the present moment. Since my last Report I have visited other schools in the Parish, which are as follows, with the result stated:— Examined. Unvaccinated. Dufour's Place, Boys, 78 4 „ Girls, 96 5 Archbishop Tenison's, 41 2 Swallow Street, Boys, 66 5 „ Infants, 72 5 Marshall Street, Boys, 218 10 Total, 571 31 The total number of children examined in the schools has been 1048, of which 62 have been 16 found unvaccinated. The number of children unvaccinated discovered by the Sanitary Inspector has been 38G, making altogether the number of 448 children discovered up to the present time who have not been vaccinated. The number of children out of this number who have been ascertained to have been vaccinated is 177. As this work is very laborious, it has occurred to me, that if the lists of the unvaccinated children were handed in to the public vaccinators, that they would have no objection to look up those children who have not presented themselves for vaccination, and who have been found unvaccinated by myself and the Sanitary Inspector in the schools." March 8th.—" What the extent of small pox in the Parish is at the present moment it is impossible to say, but at any rate, it does not exist amongst the poorer classes of the population, or in localities where it is likely to spread rapidly. Since my last Report, I have visited the St. Luke's district boys and girls schools, and have found 28 children unvaccinated amongst them. The total number of children found unvaccinated to this time is 462. Of those, 183 have been ascertained to have been vaccinated, leaving 283 children of whom as yet it is not known whether they have been vaccinated. I communicated my plan of obtaining the assistance of the public vaccinators in looking after children found to be unvaccinated to the Sanitary Committee, and at their request have waited upon those gentlemen to ascertain if they were willing, first, to supply 17 lists of all children whom they have vaccinated since the 1st January, 1860; and secondly, if they would undertake to visit the families where children were found to be unvaccinated, for the purpose of vaccinating them, or persuading them to be vaccinated. They willingly undertook to perform these duties, and it is for you to say what remuneration they should receive for their extra services." March 22nd.—" Two cases of small pox have been recorded, but these have been removed. Small pox is still, however, ravaging London, 50 fatal cases having occurred in the last fortnight. Supposing death to occur in 5 per cent, of these attacks, this gives 500 fresh cases of this disease in a single fortnight. Here we have poison enough generated to spread the disease to any extent. The Sanitary Inspector has discovered, since my last Report, 26 unvaccinated children. I have also examined the children in the following schools:— Great Crown Court, 23 children, of which 2 were unvaccinated; Scotch School, Swallow Street, boys, 58, of whom only 1 was unvaccinated; Scotch School, girls, 26, of whom 1 was unvaccinated; St. Luke's Infant School, Peter Street, 89 children, of whom 4 were unvaccinated. This makes the total number of children found to be unvaccinated, 469." The number of houses visited by the Inspector, for the purpose of ascertaining the existence of unvaccinated persons, was 1469. The number of children examined at the various schools, was B 18 altogether 1919. The number of children found unvaccinated at their parents' homes, was 361; whilst the number of children found unvaccinated in the schools, was 110, making altogether 471. It was ascertained that the greater number of these were afterwards vaccinated. At the same time the fact that so large a number of children were found unvaccinated, shews how very imperfectly the law for securing the vaccination of the public is carried out. It is very evident, unless some more stringent measures are adopted for securing the vaccination of the population of this Metropolis, that it will be liable to those epidemic visitations of small pox, such as has just passed over us, and carried off above 2000 of our population. It is almost incredible that such an immense loss of life as this should have been incurred from the neglect of a preventive of the most simple and efficacious kind. If such a number of persons had been killed by railway accidents, or had been murdered, no efforts would have been considered too great or too costly to prevent the recurrence of such a catastrophe ; but it is to be feared, with this terrible example before us, that the people are again sinking into their old apathy, and that another harvest of young and healthy life is awaiting the sickle of the destroying angel, to garner it with the other fruits of human indolence and ignorance. Although the Tables I now lay before you present other topics of interest, I forbear at the present entering upon them. After the publication of the 19 Census for 1861, I hope to obtain more minute information than I have hitherto possessed of the population of the streets and courts of the various districts, as well as the occupations of the inhabitants, and to be able to point out the relation of particular diseases to locality and employment. I would, however, remind you that in my periodical reports I have called your attention to the very wretched character of many of the dwelling houses of the poor in some of the thickly-populated districts of the Parish. In all cases that have come before me, I have directed the closing of kitchens and cellars, as lodging houses of the poor; and although this has been done to a very considerable extent, I believe that it will be found that this has had little effect in diminishing the overcrowded condition of a large number of the dwellings of the poor. It seems to me very desirable that some systematic effort should be made to erect for the poor, in the place of the miserable dwellings they occupy, lodging houses that would secure for them, at the same amount of rent they now pay, the comforts and decencies of civilised existence. The experiment has been made in the Ingestre Buildings, the Model Lodging Houses, and the Healthy Homes ; and from the success which has attended these efforts, I would urge a still further development of this class of dwellings for the poor. The disease and mortality is much less in these lodgings than in those occupied by the same class of persons in other parts of the Parish. There are many sites 20 most conveniently situated for the erection of such buildings ; and although the capital invested in them may not pay so large a dividend as that employed for the erection of houses of business, it should be recollected that the sum saved to the Parish in the diminution of disease and mortality, and the less pressing demand for charitable contributions, would more than make up for any loss thus incurred. The subject of disturbing the residences of the working classes, and the breaking up the homes of the poor by various metropolitan improvements, has been recently brought before the Imperial Legislature ; and I would suggest that as it is impossible to arrest these improvements, that one of the most efficient means by which the inconvenience and distress thus produced can be met, is by the erection of large and convenient blocks of houses, which, whilst they occupy no more space than the present wretched dwellings, would offer to the poor residences which would secure to them the means of living themselves, and rearing their families in comfort and decency, and free from the liability to unnecessary disease and death. During the past year several questions of practical interest, relating to the health of the Parish, have been discussed in the Sanitary Committee. One of these questions has arisen out of the trapping of the gullies, and the complaints of stench from the ventilating shafts in the sewers. If sewers and drains were properly constructed, there ought to be no disagreeable stench arising from them at all, 21 as ample provision is made by the water supply for carrying off all the solid matter that ought to be deposited in the sewers. Unfortunately, the sewers and drains in many districts are so badly constructed, that they allow of a deposit of solid, animal, and vegetable matter, which, during its decomposition, especially in the summer time, give off not only the most disagreeable effluvia, but also poisonous matters, destructive to the health of those who inhale them. It is on this account most desirable that these gaseous poisons should not escape into the streets or opposite houses, thickly populated with human beings. At the same time the trapping gullies and the closing ventilating shafts, is attended with two evils. The first is, that, by confining the gases in the sewers, they become so foul as to render it dangerous for the sewer-men to go down into them to clean them. The second evil is, that the gases thus confined are more readily conveyed through drains, rat holes, and other apertures, into the interior of houses. It has been recently shewn by Dr. Sanderson, that in the interior of houses where fires are kept, that there is continually maintained a diminished pressure of the atmosphere, the result of which is a continued pouring into our dwelling houses of the poisonous gases of the sewers. I have reported to you, during the year, several fatal cases of fever, erysipelas, and sore throat, occurring in the largest houses in the parish, and which I could trace to no other cause than the constant leakage into the 22 house of the poisonous contents of the drains or sewers. It was from a conviction of the necessity of ventilating the sewers without discharging the gases immediately into the street, that I recommended having recourse to ventilating shafts, to be carried high up into the air, where the discharge of the gases would not be injurious. Two such shafts already exist, one in Peter Street, and one in Heddon Passage, and in a limited way have served to relieve the sewers without annoying or injuring human beings. A system of this sort has been carried out under the direction of Dr. Letheby, in the City of London, and from an examination of one of these shafts in Philpot Lane, I believe it has effectually relieved the neighbourhood from the smell of the sewer. Dr. Letheby has adopted the plan of allowing the sewer air to pass through a filter of animal charcoal before it passes into the atmosphere, and this seems to have had the effect of removing any impure smell from the escaping gas. There has been at present no further erection of ventilating shafts in this Parish, but I am prepared to recommend them where the inhabitants complain of the smell of the sewers. With our present knowledge of the consequences of trapping gullies, and closing ventilating shafts, I think it unsafe that this practice should be carried any further. In fact, I believe that, as far as the public health is concerned, that it would be better 23 that our sewers should be perfectly open, than that their gases should be allowed to pass off either in a concentrated form into our streets, or poison the air of our houses. Open sewers in fact have certain other advantages over closed sewers, and one of these is, that you can see the abominations that are allowed to accumulate and fester in the one case, which you cannot in the other. The condition of drains is one that cannot be so easily ascertained as that of sewers. They cannot be brought under public inspection, and a knowledge of their condition can only be obtained by visiting the particular houses to which they are attached. Wherever complaints are made of the condition of drains as nuisances injurious to health, they are either renewed or repaired under the power given to the local authorities, either under the Nuisances Removal Act, or the Metropolis Local Management Act, as the case may be. At the same time I would call attention to the great amount of ill health which arises amongst the more opulent portions of the community, from the neglect of the state of the drains in their houses. For the last two or three years, the worst cases of neglected drainage have not been in houses inhabited by the poor, but by those inhabited by the wealthier classes of the community. It is to me frequently matter of great astonishment to find how regardless those classes are whose circumstances can command every comfort of life, 24 of the sources of disease and death. This is not only seen in the neglect of attention to drainage, but also in the neglect of ventilation. In the present arrangement of our houses, which in the great majority of cases are constructed with great disregard to the comfort or health of their inhabitants, the best mode of ventilating sitting and sleeping rooms is by the letting down of the upper sash of the window. In all cases where provision has not been made for this arrangement in the dwellings of the poor, I have directed that it should be done by the landlord, on the ground that an unventilated room is a nuisance injurious to health. But whilst this has been done for the poor, there are scores of houses occupied by the middle and upper classes in this Parish in which none of the windows open from the top, and in which the heavy atmosphere indicates the moment you enter them that a current of fresh air has never passed through them since the time they were built. It is in houses of this sort that the health of the inhabitant is silently undermined, whilst the outbreak of disease, or the occurrence of death, is regarded as the visitation of a mysterious Providence. "The curse, causeless, does not "come," and it should ever be remembered that disease and premature death are the punishments society has to bear for breaking God's laws. In August 1860, an Act passed the Legislature, entitled "An Act for Preventing the Adulteration of 25 "Articles of Food or Drink." This Act was the result of a knowledge, on the part of the Legislature, of the fact, that throughout the country the practice of adulterating food extensively prevailed. These adulterations being of a kind that could not be detected by the public who suffered from them, it was thought right to give local bodies throughout the country the power of appointing competent individuals to analyse food and to institute proceedings against those who were guilty of this practice. The first clause of this Act provides, that "Every " person who shall sell any article of food or drink " with which, to the knowledge of such person, any " ingredient or material injurious to the health of " persons eating or drinking such article, has been '' mixed; and every person who shall sell as pure " or unadulterated every or any article of food or " drink which is adulterated or not pure, shall, for " every such offence, pay a penalty not exceeding " five pounds." The second clause provides," That " the local authorities shall from time to time " appoint one or more persons, possessing competent " medical, chemical, and microscopical knowledge, 4 4 as analysts of all articles of food and drink, such " appointments to be at all times subject to the " approval of one of Her Majesty's principal Secre" taries of State." The Act also provides," That " any purchaser of any article of food or drink in " any district, county, city, or borough, where there " is any analyst appointed under this Act, shall be 26 " entitled, on payment to the analyst of a sum " not less than two shillings and sixpence nor more " than ten shillings and sixpence, to have any such " article analysed by any analyst who maybe appoint" ed for such district, county, city, or borough, " and to receive from such analyst a certificate of " the result of his analysis, specifying whether, " in his opinion, such article is adulterated, and " also whether it is so adulterated as to be injurious " to the health of persons eating or drinking the " same; and such certificate duly signed by such " analyst shall, in the absence of any evidence to " the contrary, be sufficient evidence before the " Justices or in any court of justice of the matters " therein certified, and the sum so directed to be " paid for such certificate shall be deemed a part of " the costs." Perceiving the importance of this Act in enabling you to carry out measures for the improvement of the health of the Parish, I called your attention to its provisions, and I have to thank you for the confidence you have placed in me, by appointing me to the important and responsible position of analyst, under the provisions of this Act. I have not, however, accepted this office as one necessarily attached to the position of Medical Officer of Health. I have for many years been engaged in the study of the physiological and medical relations of food to the human system, and accustomed to its chemical and microscopical analysis, or I should not have ventured 27 to accept an office, upon the intelligent exercise of which, not unfrequently the lives, and always the reputations of my Fellow-Parishioners may depend. The due discharge, however, of the functions of this office, depends not alone on the skill of the analyst. He requires a proper office and apparatus to carry out his investigations. He should have instructions from those who have appointed him to investigate occasionally all articles of food consumed by the community, whether they be rich or poor. An announcement of his appointment should also be made as widely as possible, so that both vendors of articles of food and drink and the public should know that such an officer exists. The fact of adulteration should be treated as criminal, and whatever is done in the way of police, to detect and punish thieves who steal property alone, ought to bo done with much more rigour to detect the adulterators of food, who not only steal the money of the public, but rob it of its health and life. There are several other subjects to which I might allude, which have been brought before you during the year 1860, as the state of the cow-houses and slaughter-houses; the supply of water from the surface wells; the ventilation of public buildings; the inspection of the workshops, especially the bakohouses, of the Parish; and the cleansing of the dwellings of the poor; but as these are subjects of recurring interest, and I have already occupied considerable space, I will, with your permission, 28 defer referring to them more in detail to a subsequent Report. I have the honour to be, My Lord and Gentlemen, Your most obedient humble Servant, EDWIN LANKESTER. A P P ENDIX, CONTAINING PAGE 1. Tables of Causes of Death 30 2.
