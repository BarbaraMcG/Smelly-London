Borlase Hill Adams, Esq , J.P., of 51, Bedford Square, was, in the month of June, 1881, for the eighth time, elected the representative of this Board at the Metropolitan Board of Works, and has filled that office for the last twenty-two years, much to the satisfaction of this Board. I/ / The Decease of Members. Richard Clewin Griffith, Esq., of No. 20, Grower Street, who had been a member of this Board since the year 1861, died in the month of September in last year. The Board desired to record the loss of one of their oldest and most active members, and on the announcement of his decease, a Resolution was passed at the next Meeting, expressive of their sincere regret at the death of their old friend and colleague, and of their appreciation of the valuable services rendered by him to the parishes of St. Giles and Bloomsbury during the long period of twenty-two years in which he acted as member of the Board. Thomas Meggy, Esq., of No. 22, Bedford Place, a very able and active member of the Board (especially in financial matters), elected in 1879, died in the month of July, 1881. The Board desire to express much regret at his loss. The late Surveyor of the Board. Mr. William Joshua Trehearne, the Surveyor of the Board from its creation in 1856 until 1875 (when he retired from loss of sight on an annual allowance of £100), died in the month of April, 1881. ( 10 ) Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875. GREAT WILD STREET SCHEME. This Improvement has been completed by the demolition of the wretched habitations and courts formerly standingoil the site of the extensive and healthy pile of buildings recently erected by the Peabody Charity, and forms a very striking contrast with the former buildings thereon, especially in Drury Lane, Kemble Street, and Great Wild Street. It contains 804 rooms, and is fully occupied by 1,470 inmates, consisting in part of 344 families. It is a most admirable Improvement in the district. LITTLE CORAM STREET SCHEME. This area presents an appearance similar to that of last year. A very small portion of the miserable buildings thereon have been taken down. The claims of the disputed owners and occupiers have been recently adjudicated on by Sir Henry Hunt, the Arbitrator appointed by the Secretary of State, and there is therefore reason to believe that a speedy and early settlement of such claims and clearance of the site will now take place. The area has been purchased by the Trustees of the Peabody Charity, for the erection of model buildings thereon. Little Coram Street is also to be widened 40 feet. ( 11 ) Artizans Dwellings Acts 1868 & 1879. These Acts, in conjunction with the Artizans and Labourers Dwelling Improvement Act, 1875, have been the subject of the careful consideration during the last and present Session of a Select Committee of the House of Commons; at the time of this Report going to press, the Committee have issued their Report, which requires careful consideration, but owing to the state of Irish affairs, it is not anticipated that the amendments of the Statutes in question, suggested thereby, will become Law this session, Enlargement of the Offices of the Board, The works have been completed: an elegant entrance formed at No. 197, High Holborn, with a handsome corridor leading to new and suitable Offices for the Surveyor and Staff, together with a light stone staircase to new Board and Committee Rooms on the first floor. Measures are in progress for disposing of the remaining premises, consisting of the House, No. 198, High Holborn, and the ground in the rear. Public Mortuary. This building has been erected after plans prepared by the Surveyor of the Board, and presents an erection of an elegant character, in red brick with stone dressings; the interior is in course of completion, and will be ready for use in the course of the present year. Re-naming and Re-numbering Oxford Street, The Metropolitan Board of Works having made an order to re-number this Street, which extended from the Edgware ( 12 ) Road to Bury Place, Bloomsbury; the result was that very great confusion arose by the re-numbering, causing a repetition of many numbers in the portion of that Street in the District of this Board. To remedy this state of things, the Metropolitan Board of Works issued an order naming that part of Oxford Street in this District, "New Oxford Street," and for re-numbering the houses accordingly ; the order has been carried into effect. Goldsmith's Alley Improvement. The Account for this Improvement has been finally closed. The Metropolitan Board of Works in the month of June, 1881, paid the sum of £1,126: 10s., the contribution agreed to be made towards the acquisition of the land needed for the same. The advantage of the Improvement has been stated in a previous Report of the Board. Sale of Food and Drags Act, 1875. The articles analysed during the year were 292. Proceedings were instituted in eight cases, and convictions obtained. The fines and costs imposed by the Magistrates amounted to £15: 6s. The continued enforcement of the Act in this District, has caused considerable abatement in the sale of adulterated articles of food. Dr. Redwood, the able Analyst, continues the Analyst of this Board. His Report is subjoined. ( 13 ) Nuisances Removal Acts. Active proceedings under these Acts have been rendered necessary in this District, owing to the prevalence of disease in the miserable dwellings on the site of the Little Coram Street area. During the year 53 Summonses have been heard and adjudicated on by the Magistrates, and Orders have been made in 26 cases for the entire closing of such dwellings. In the other cases the Orders have been either complied with by the owners of the premises wherein the nuisances existed, or they have been carried out by the Board at the cost of such owners. Water Supply. These burdensome Taxes still continue. The Speech from the Throne, at the opening of the present Session of Parliament, announced a Bill to amend the Law relating to the water supply would be dealt with this Session, but owing to the Irish disturbances it has not been brought in.

Surveyor's Office, 197, High Holborn, 27th June, 1882. Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you the following Report on the works executed by your Board during the year ending 25th March, 1882. Carriage-way Pavings. Situation. Description of Paving. Net cost.

Chenies Street. Russell Square, north and Bernard Street. south-east sides. Brunswick Square. Relay of Wood Paving. The wood paving in High Street, laid by Messrs. Mowlem & Company in October, 1875, being in bad repair, was taken up by the contractors in March, 1882, and new wood blocks laid in place thereof at their expense. New Sewers. The following lengths of new Sewers were constructed during the year:— Russell Square (west side) and Upper Montague Street to Woburn Square 431ft. lineal of brick sewer, 4ft. by 2ft. 6in. internal dimensions. Woburn Street, N. end 80 do. do. Duke Street, N. end 62 do. do. Bernard Street, East of Kenton Street 116 do. do. Total 689 ft. lineal of new brick sewers. Underpinning Sewers, About 53 feet of the sewer in Woburn Street and about 70 feet of the sewer in Duke Street were underpinned, so as to give them additional depth. (33) Street Cleansing. The cleansing of the public carriage-ways was performed by a staff of men employed by the Board, consisting of 1 foreman, 3 gangers, and 31 sweepers. Two sweeping machines, drawn by horses, were used in sweeping the paved carriage-ways. The street sweepings were carted away by contract, and amounted to a total of 10,570 loads. The carriage-ways of High Holborn, New Oxford Street, Little Queen Street, High Street, Hart Street, and Great and Little St. Andrew Streets, were washed on several occasions during the year by means of watering-carts and the machine brooms. The cost of the washing is included in the two items of cost for street cleansing and street watering given hereafter. Terms of Contract. The contracts for scavenging, dusting, and street watering, and for the supply of materials, have heretofore been let by the Board annually, for terms expiring at Michaelmas in each year. The Annual Accounts of the Board, being by statute terminable at Lady Day, the Board considered it desirable to alter the letting of its contracts so that they should terminate at the same date as the financial year, and accordingly advertised for tenders for a term firstly of eighteen months from Michaelmas, 1881, to Lady Day, 1883, and resolved to revert to the system of annual contracts after the latter date. c (34) Street Watering. The street watering was performed by contract, the Contractor supplying all carts, horses, and drivers required, at a fixed price for the whole work for the year. The water used for this purpose (including that used for street washing) was 4,166,000 gallons. £ s. d. The amount paid for water, meter hire, repairs of stand posts, &c., was 260 17 11 To contractors for carts, horses, and men 677 0 0 Total £937 17 11 Removal of Dust. The dust and ashes were removed from the houses in the District by contract, the contractor providing all necessary men, horses, and carts, and performing the whole work at a cost of £1,695:16s. 8d. Street-orderly Boys. Eight boys and one man (acting as ganger) were employed during the year in cleansing the public footways in the District during wet and sloppy weather, and in collecting the horse droppings on the surface of the wood paving in High Holborn and New Oxford Street in dry weather. Cost of Street Cleansing. The total cost of the street cleansing for the year ending 25th March, 1882, was as follows:— (35)  £ s. d. Wages of men and boys 2,033 15 0 Brooms, scrapers, shovels, &c., and clothing for men and boys 135 18 9 Cartage of slop and street sweepings, and hire of horses for street sweeping and sand distributing machines 2,224 0 0 Total cost of cleansing for the year £4,393 13 9 Limewhiting Courts. The walls of buildings at the entrances to the Mews, Yards, Courts, Alleys, &c., in the District, were twice cleansed and limewhited during the year, at a cost of £70. Public Urinals. One additional urinal was erected during the year, viz., that in Shorts Gardens; this is in nearly the same position as was occupied by an urinal which had existed there for many years, but was demolished at the time the old buildings of St. Giles Workhouse were pulled down, it being formed on portion of the Workhouse Yard. The new urinal is placed entirely on the public way. The public urinals now belonging to the Board are 19 in number, and contain 52 compartments: 11 of the urinals, containing 41 compartments, have water laid on to them, the others have not. The whole of them are cleansed daily by the Board's workmen. LIST OF PUBLIC URINALS IN THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Bainsbridge Street 5 compartments, Water Supply laid on.

"Sugg's Improved Street Lamps," each giving a light equal to 80 candles, were fixed on the crossing refuges in New Oxford Street, opposite Museum Street, and in High Holborn, by Little Queen Street, and one giving a light of 50 candles at the west end of Theobald's Road. One of 80 candles was also placed in High Street, on the railings by the entrance to St. Giles Church. The "Sugg's Improved Burners" and lamp on the refuge, at the junction of High Holborn and New Oxford Street, were removed, and on the application of Messrs. Siemens, and at their expense, one of "Siemens' Patent Regenerative Gas Burner Lamps," giving a light equal to 200 candles, was fixed in place thereof; a lamp on the same principle, but giving a light of 80 candles, was also placed at the refuge at the north end of High Street, St. Giles also at the expense of the patentees. (37) The work of substituting the new improved circular street lamps for those of the old square pattern, was proceeded with during the year. The total number of those lamp-posts and lanterns erected in the District at Lady Day, 1882, was 403. Street Refuges. One additional street crossing refuge was formed at the north end of High Street. There are now seventeen of these refuges in the St. Giles District, viz:— High Holborn Do. New Oxford Street Do. Do. Do. Do. Tottenham Ct. Rd. High Street Endell Street Broad Street Do. Do. Bloomsbury Street Theobald's Road Do. Guildford Street By Little Queen Street At Junction with New Oxford Street East of its Junction with Bloomsbury St. West of do. do. do.

By Drinking Fountain South end, by Broad Street West end, by Southampton Row Opposite Orange Street West end, by Russell Square. They are all well lighted, and afford great assistance to pedestrians in crossing the carriage-ways. (38) MISCELLANEOUS. Proposed Improvement in Little Queen Street. Two of the houses on the east side of Little Queen Street, and in the narrow part of that street, being about to be pulled down for the purpose of re-building, it was considered that a favourable opportunity was offered for effecting a public improvement, by widening the public way. The width of the northern end of Little Queen Street, between High Holborn and Gate Street, varied from 27ft. Gin. to 30ft.; south of Gate Street it is 40ft. wide, and it was proposed to make the northern end of that width. A Memorial, signed by 93 of the neighbouring owners and occupiers of premises, was presented to the Board, urging it to effect the suggested improvement. The matter was fully considered by your Board, who resolved that "the widening was necessary," and asked the Metropolitan Board of Works to what extent it would assist in carrying out the improvement. The Metropolitan Board offered to contribute the sum of £10,000, and your Surveyor was thereupon instructed to communicate with the owners of the various properties required to be taken, and ascertain on what terms they would dispose of the same. This was done, when the various sums demanded represented so large an amount, that your Board resolved not to proceed further in the matter. Improvement, 279, High Holborn. A small but useful public improvement was effected at No. 279, High Holborn; a bay window, which projected (39) 2 ft. 3 in. on to the public way, being pulled down, and the frontage set back to the general line of building frontage. Re-naming and Re-numbering New Oxford Street. The Metropolitan Board of Works having re-numbered that portion of Oxford Street which lies west of Tottenham Court Road, introduced a series of numbers which already existed in that portion of Oxford Street lying within the St. Giles District; considerable inconvenience was consequently caused thereby, which being represented to the Metropolitan Board of Works, that Board ordered the name of "New Oxford Street" to be restored, and the houses re-numbered, which has been done. Gates and Railings, Phœnix Street. The iron gates and railings which stood across the western end of Phœnix Street were, on the application of the managers of Bloomsbury Chapel, removed by the Board, and the street opened for through traffic. Drinking Fountain, Lincoln's Inn Fields. Application was made to your Board by the Metropolitan Drinking Fountains Association for permission to erect a Drinking Fountain, presented by Mrs. Philip Twells, at the south-east corner of Lincoln's Inn Fields. A deputation from the Association waited on your Board, and submitted a model of the proposed Fountain, which showed a handsome structure, to be formed of polished Cornish granite, 6 ft. 8 in. square, and about 20 ft. in height. The Board sanctioned the erection of the Fountain, and the works are now (June, 1882) in progress. (40) Railway and other Schemes. Plans and Notices for the following Schemes affecting this District were duly deposited at the Private Bill Office in anticipation of the present Session of Parliament:— The Central Metropolitan Railway, The Mid Metropolitan Railway, The St. Pancras Workhouse Extension. They were reported on at length by your Surveyor on 14th February, 1882. The Central Metropolitan Railway was a proposed line of Underground Railway, about 37 ft. deep, to run from King's Cross to Westminster, entering your District at Hunter Street, crossing High Holborn by Little Queen Street, thence down Little Queen Street and Great Queen Street (both of which thoroughfares it was proposed to widen), and thence beneath Long Acre, St. Martin's Lane, Charing Cross, &c. to Westminster. After full consideration of the merits of the proposed Scheme your Board petitioned the Legislature against it. The Bill passed the Standing Orders of the House of Commons, but was rejected by the House on the second reading. The Mid Metropolitan Railway was a proposed line of railway from the Uxbridge Road (near to the West Junction Railway) to the Minories in the City of London. It was proposed to enter your District in New Oxford Street by Tottenham Court Road, and thence along New Oxford Street and High Holborn; it was to be entirely underground, at depths of about 30 to 35 feet, and to be worked on the pneumatic principle by stationary engines fixed at permanent stations on its line of route. The Promoters (41) did not comply with the Standing Orders of the House of Commons, and the Bill was not therefore proceeded with. St. Pancras Workhouse Extension was a Scheme promoted by the St. Pancras Vestry for the acquisition of a site for the enlargement of the Workhouse accommodation in the St. Pancras Road, and for that purpose it was proposed to take various properties there which are within the St. Giles parish. No interests of your Board were affected by the Scheme, and you therefore took no action in the matter. The bill has since passed the Legislature, and received the Royal Assent. Telephone Wires. The United Telephone Company, in the year 1880, placed various wires across the public ways within the District, without having first obtained your consent thereto. Notice was served upon the Company by your Board to remove the same, which the Company did, and subsequently applied to you for permission to erect various wires throughout the District. The matter was fully considered by you, and certain regulations as to strength of wire, height of supports above the public ways, and the angles at which public ways should be crossed by the wires, were resolved upon by your Board as the conditions on which such applications would only be granted. These conditions, after considerable negotiation, the Company assented to, and they formed the basis of an Agreement which was entered into between the Board and the Company in October, 1881. Enlargement of Offices. The Enlargement of the Board's Offices and construction (42) of new Board and Committee Rooms, with the New Entrance from High Holborn, have been completed, and the whole of the premises are now in use. Mortuary and Coroner's Court. These buildings were commenced within the year, and are now nearly completed. New Streets to be formed by Metropolitan Board of Works. In 1877 the Metropolitan Board of Works obtained an Act of Parliament, known as the Metropolitan Street Improvement Act, 1877, which authorized that Board to form certain new streets and effect other Improvements within the metropolis; amongst them are two new streets which are partly within the St. Giles District. 1. A new street, commencing in New Oxford Street, near to Duke Street, proceeding thence, in a south-westerly direction, across Thorney Street, Vine Street, Bloomsbury Street, and Broad Street, to the north end of Dudley Street, and thence, by the widening of Dudley Street on its southeastern side, to Moor Street, where it will leave the St. Giles District, and continue by way of King Street and Richmond Street, crossing Rupert Street, Windmill Street, and Tichborne Street, to a junction with Regent Circus, Piccadilly. 2. A new line of street, commencing in Oxford Street at its junction with Tottenham Court Road, thence by the widening of Crown Street, on its eastern side, to Moor Street, where it crosses the other new street just described, and leaving St. Giles District proceeds southwards across Grafton Street, Titchfield Street, Prince's (43) Row, to Castle Street (which is to be widened on both sides), and thence, across Hemming's Row to St. Martin's Place (which is to be widened on its west side), to Trafalgar Square, the eastern carriage-way of which is also to be widened. These new streets will, when completed, form most important and convenient lines of thoroughfare; their formation has been retarded by various causes, but the Metropolitan Board has recently resolved to proceed with them, and (as I am informed) is now taking measures to acquire the various properties necessary to be pulled down for their formation. It may be therefore confidently anticipated that within the next two or three years the streets will be formed and opened to the public traffic. Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Act, 1875. In 1876, the Metropolitan Board of Works, acting under the powers of the Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Act, 1875, prepared a Scheme, dealing with a block of property in Drury Lane, Kemble Street, and Great Wild Street, which your Medical Officer of Health had reported to that Board as being dangerous to health and unfit for human habitation. The Scheme was confirmed by an Act passed in 1877, entitled Metropolis (Great Wild Street, &c.) Improvement Schemes Confirmation Act, 1877. Under the provisions of the said Acts, the Metropolitan Board of Works acquired and pulled down the property so condemned, and cleared the site, which was then disposed of to the Trustees of the Peabody Fund, and new buildings for the accommodation of the labouring classes have since been erected on the site. (44) The buildings were completed last year and are now fully occupied, giving accommodation for about 1,500 people, which is about the same number as those displaced by the demolition of the old buildings. Widening of Great Wild Street and Kemble Street. The public ways of Great Wild Street, at its southern end, and Kemble Street, were widened by the Metropolitan Board of Works in carrying out the above Scheme. The portion of Great Wild Street abutting on the site, was formerly from 24 ft. to 30 ft. wide, and Kemble Street was from 20 ft. to 23 ft. wide; they have been made in no part less than 40 ft. wide, and their surfaces repaved by the Metropolitan Board of Works with new York stone in the footways, and new granite pitching in the carriage-ways. The remaining length of the paving in Great Wild Street, being in bad condition, has since been taken up by your Board, and the footways and carriage-way repaved with similar paving to those laid by the Metropolitan Board. The improvement on the narrow, ill-ventilated streets, courts and alleys, and the wretched habitations in them, which has been affected under the Scheme is very marked, and can only be properly appreciated by those who were acquainted with the previous state of the property, and able to compare it with the present aspect of the locality. Contracts. The following is a List of the Contracts entered into by the Board and in force up to the 25th day of March, 1883:- (45) Name and Address of the Contractor. Nature of Contract. Term of Contract. J. J. Griffiths, 283, Kingsland Road. For the supply of granite and Yorkshire stone, as per schedule of prices. Eighteen months from 29th September, 1881. C.

TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, The vital statistics of the District in the Annual Report for the year 1881, are prepared from the corrected returns of the population, taken at the decennial census in the spring of that year. St. Giles District. Area in statute acres, 245. Density of population, 185 to an acre. The average elevation of the District is about 68 ft. above Trinity high-water mark. The population in the three Sub-Districts into which St. Giles is divided was, according to the census returns of 1851, 1861, 1871, and 1881, as follows:— Sub-Districts. 1851. 1861. 1871. 1881.

The marriages celebrated in London in 1881, numbered 34,331, equal to a rate of 18.0 per 1,000, one of the lowest rates on record. * The Peabody Model Buildings in Great Wild Street and Drury Lane, built on the site cleared under the provisions of the Artizans Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875, were, on the 1st June, 1882, occupied by 1,465 persons, who were not housed there when the census was taken in 1881, so that now the population of that Sub-District (South St. Giles), is 16,337, and the population of the whole District, 46,722. ( 51 ) The marriages registered in England and Wales in 1881, were 196,877, and equal to a rate of 15.1 per 1,000. Births and Birth.rate. During the past year there were 1,487 children born in the District; 727 males, and 760 females. The births registered in the Sub.Districts were :— St. George, Bloomsbury 396 St. Giles, South 639 St. Giles, North 452 Whole District 1,487 From this number 152 births must be deducted, as they were the children of mothers who belonged, by previous residence, to the Strand Union and other Metropolitan parishes.

The birth.rate for London was at the rate of 34.7 per 1,000 persons living. This rate (the lowest since 1871), was 5.3 higher than the rate for this District. The birth.rate for England and Wales was equal to 33.9 per 1,000. Deaths and Death.rate. During the year there were 1,008 deaths in the District, 553 males and 455 females. The deaths registered in the three Sub.Districts were:—. St. George, Bloomsbury 224 St. Giles, South 513 St. Giles, North 271 Whole District 1,008 To obtain an actual death.rate, the following 56 deaths of non-parishioners must be deducted; viz., 44 from the Workhouse, Broad Street (24 belonging, by previous residence, to the Strand Union, and 20 to miscellaneous parishes), 8 from the British Lying.in Hospital, Endell Street, and 4 from the Infants' Home, 35, Great Coram Street; and the deaths of 162 parishioners must be added, who died in the public hospitals and institutions situated out of the District. The alterations are shown in the following tables:— ( 53 ) Number of Deaths of Parishioners belonging to St. Giles District in Public Institutions situate out of the District.

The deaths registered in the whole of the Metropolis were in the proportion of 21.2 to 1,000 inhabitants, and 3.4 less than the rate for St. Giles District. The Registrar General states that, "comparing the five groups of Districts into which London is divided with each other, the death.rate, as almost invariably is the case, was lowest in the Western Districts, and highest in the overcrowded and comparatively poor Eastern and Central Districts ; whilst the Northern and Southern Districts held an intermediate position." The death.rate for England and Wales was 18.9 per 1,000. Deaths of Infants and Young Children. 235 Infants died under 1 year of age, and 379 children died before they reached 5 years of age. The following. diseases caused the greatest fatality amongst them:—viz., bronchitis, 59 deaths ; atrophy and debility, 54 ; convulsions, 35; diarrhoea, 29; whooping.cough, 28; premature birth, 22; measles, 20; hydrocephalus, or water on the brain, 19 ; croup, 14 ; teething, 13 ; and pneumonia, 13. Deaths of Old People. 243 persons died at 60 years and upwards, and 32 died at 80 years and upwards : the principal causes of death were from bronchitis, heart disease, and old age. ( 55 ) Uncertified Deaths. Only 5 deaths were registered as "uncertified," against 11 for the previous year, and an average of 6; 3 of the deceased persons were attended by midwives, and 2 by medical students. No legislation has yet been made on this important subject. No less than 1,051 deaths in London were registered as " uncertified " during the past year. The Infants' Home, No. 35, Great Coram Street. 4 deaths occurred at this nursery of infants under 3 months of age, described as children of " female domestic servants":— 2 died from diarrhoea ; 1 from struma, scrofula ; and 1 from debility. The British Lying.in Hospital, Endell Street, Miss Freeman, the able matron of this institution, informs me that, during the year 1881, 160 poor women were delivered in the hospital of 163 children, of whom 64 were males, and 99 females. 3 mothers were confined with twins. Among the inpatients 6 of the children, or 3.75 per cent. of the whole number, were still.born, and among the out.patients 14, or 2.82 per cent. There were 8 deaths among the in.patients, viz. : a female, aged 25 years, from puerperal septicoemia; 4 children from premature birth ; 2 from convulsions; and 1 from patency of the foramen ovale. ( 56 ) The low mortality is creditable to the management, and bears testimony to the value of the use of antiseptics in lying.in hospitals. The Bloomsbury Dispensary, Streatham Street. Since my last report, this old.established and useful medical charity has been removed from Great Russell Street to Streatham Street. The following tabulated list of cases kindly supplied to me by Dr. Steel, the resident medical officer of the institution, shows that the services of the staff are much appreciated by the sick poor in the district.

During the year there were 318 pauper deaths, viz. : 224 persons died at the workhouse (including 24 parishioners belonging to the Strand Union), 24 parishioners died at the Edmonton Infirmary, 25 at the Highgate Sick Asylum (57) Hospital, 27 at the Cleveland Street Hospital, 9 at Cater. ham and 1 at Darenth Asylum ; and 8 at hospitals belonging to the Metropolitan Asylum District Board. Inquests. 72 inquests were held. 11 of the deaths occurred in St. George, Bloomsbury ; 36 in St. Giles South (which includes the Workhouse) ; and 25 in St. Giles North. Of these, 47 died from natural causes, 13 from accidental causes, 8 from suicide, and 4 from wilful causes. Cause of Death. St. George, Bloomsbury. St. Giles South. St. Giles North. Whole District.

Small.Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping.Cough, Fever: (Typhoid, Typhus, and Simple Continued), and Diarrhœa. The number of deaths from these diseases in England and Wales was 58,239, and equal to a death.rate of 2.23 per 1,000. Of the 81,071 deaths from all causes registered in London, 13,906, or 17.2 per cent., were ascribed to some or other of the chief zymotic diseases. The death.rate from these collectively was 3.64 per 1,000, which was below the average. The number of deaths from these diseases in St. Giles' district was 142, equal to a death.rate of 3.l per 1,000, and below the decennial average. The Registrar.General states in his annual summary" that the most notable feature in the zymotic mortality for the year was the high death.rate from small.pox. The deaths from this disease were 2,371, giving a rate of 0.62 per 1,000. Only on seven occasions had this rate been exceeded in the previous 43 years, and the prevalence of this disease was the more remarkable inasmuch as neither the rest of* England and Wales nor any other of the large towns was similarly affected." * In the Quarterly Return of Marriages, Births, and Deaths of England and Wales registered during January, February, and March, 1882, the Registrar.General remarks, "that while small.pox has been gradually declining in London and its immediate neighbourhood for the past four quarters, it has been simultaneously increasing in the rest of England and Wales." ( 59 ) In the Metropolis during the week ended 1st January, 1881, there were 470 patients in the several small.pox hospitals, and during the week ended 18th June, 1881 (the height of the epidemic), there were no less than 1,737 persons in hospitals. Small . Pox (decennial average 12.8).—This District shared, in common with the Metropolis, in both a heavy sick and death.rate from this infectious disease. 106 cases were reported, of these 71 were removed to hospitals—55 to Fulham, 9 to Stockwell, and 4 to Deptford, belonging to the Metropolitan Asylum Board, and 3 to hospitals unconnected with pauper establishments. The remaining 35 patients remained under medical treatment at their respective homes. There were 10 fatal cases, 4 in the District, and 6 removed to Fulham Hospital. 83 of the patients were attacked between the months of April and August, only 6 between January and March, and 17 from September to the end of the year. The reports from the several hospitals stated that the majority of these patients had been vaccinated previous to their being attacked with the disease. In April several of our pauper patients could not be removed in consequence of the hospitals belonging to the Asylum Board being full ; at the same date the London Small.Pox Hospital (for paying patients) was also reported to be full. The vaccination return of the District kindly supplied to me by the vaccination officer, Mr. Yardley, is shown in Table 11, Appendix, ( 60 ) The following Tabulated Summary, showing the number of small.pox cases in St. Giles District during the epidemics of 1871.2, and that of 1876.7.8.9 1880.1, may be of interest.

Scarlet Fever (decennial average 26.9).—19 deaths were recorded (including the death of a parishioner at the London Fever Hospital), the lowest fatality since 1878. 7 patients were removed to Stockwell Hospital. ( 61 ) Diphtheria (decennial average 4.3). — There were 6 deaths (all children); 3 died in the District and 3 in public hospitals. In addition, several children of poor parishioners were admitted into the Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street, suffering from this disease. Whooping.Cough (decennial average 37.2).—29 children died from it. The Metropolitan death.rate from this disease was the lowest on record. Diarrhœa (decennial average 54.0).—The death.rate for the year was unusually low. There were 36 deaths; of these 29 were children. Fever (decennial average 19.7). — Including typhoid, typhus, and simple continued fever. There were 20 deaths from these forms of fever (our heaviest death.rate since 1874); of these 16 were attributed to typhoid (including 6 at hospitals), 1 to typhus, and 3 to simple continued fever. The fever was most severe during the summer and autumn months. 7 cases of typhoid and 13 of typhus were removed to Stockwell Hospital; besides these many cases of sickness were reported remaining at their own homes under medical treatment. Typhus broke out in Marchmont Place, part of the Little Coram Street area condemned under the Artizans Dwellings Act, 1875. The disease spread rapidly, and its progress was not arrested until most of the filthy and dilapidated houses in this court were closed by a Magistrate's order. There have been two outbreaks of typhus fever in the District since I have been your Medical Officer ; viz., in ( 62 ) Orange Court, Great Wild Street, and in Marclnnont Place, Little Coram Street. Both of these places formed portions of areas condemned under the Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Act, 1875. Hospitals' Commission.—A Royal Commission, consisting of Lord Blackford, Mr. Pemberton, M.P., Sir James Paget, Bart., Sir Rutherford Alcock, Dr. Burdon Sanderson, Dr. Alfred Carpenter, Dr. Broadbent, and Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson, was appointed by the Government to inquire into the management of small.pox and fever hospitals, with a view to further legislation respecting them. "1. As to the nature, extent, and sufficiency of the hospital accommodation for small.pox and fever patients provided by the managers of the Metropolitan Asylum Board and the several Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis, including the Commissioners of Sewers for the City of London. "2. The relative advantages and disadvantages to patients and the public of providing for small.pox and fever cases, whether among persons of the pauper class or persons of the non.pauper class, without proper means of isolation, or both, by a limited number of hospitals for the whole Metropolis under one authority, such as the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylum District, or by parochial and District hospitals under Vestries and District Boards. "3. The expediency of continuing the several existing small.pox and fever hospitals now under the managers of the Metropolitan Asylum District; or if it be considered desirable that any should be closed, the accommodation for small.pox and fever cases which should be substituted. ( 63 ) "4. The expediency of the managers of the Metropolitan Asylum District establishing additional hospitals and making special provision for convalescent cases. "5. The conditions and limitations under which the hospitals provided by the managers should be continued, and the general conditions and limitations which should be observed in the case of the establishment of new hospitals, whether by managers or any other authority, so as to insure, as far as practicable, the recovery of the patients and the protection of the public against contagion. "6. The operation of the Acts relating to the establishment of hospitals for small.pox and fever patients in the Metropolis, and the provisions, if any, required for the acquisition of sites for such hospitals, whether by agreement or otherwise, and for the protection of the authorities providing small.pox and fever hospitals, subject to the same being; conducted with reasonable care and according; to prescribed regulations from liability to legal proceedings, so as to secure the public against the loss of the benefits arising from such limitations, and to make such suggestions as may be deemed expedient in connection with all or any of the matters aforesaid." The Royal Commission has, from time to time, examined scientific witnesses on the above.mentioned specified subjects. It is to be hoped that their report to Parliament may lead to legislation, which will settle the vexed question of the infectious diseases' hospitals, and so prevent further litigation respecting them. The Appeal No. 1 of the long.contested case of "Hill and Others v. The Managers of the Metropolitan Asylum ( 64 ) District Board, re the Hampstead Hospital," has recently (May, 1882) been heard, and judgment delivered in favour of the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylum Board, and the case is now in the same position as when proceedings were first instituted in 1876. All Outbreak of Scarlet Fever. A serious outbreak of scarlet fever, remarkable for the suddenness of its appearance and the comparative mildness of its form, occurred early in January, 1882, chiefly attacking the families residing in the Russell Square area of the District. Previous to the outbreak, this part of the District had been particularly free from scarlet fever, for only 3 cases were reported during the previous three months ended December, 1881 ; but, from the middle of January to the 6th of February, 1882, 76 cases were reported, in forty.three houses—29 of these were adults, and 47 children. The only fatality was that of a lady aged 82. The majority of the patients were attacked between the loth and 25th of January. Besides the 76 cases, many of the other residents of the forty.three infected houses, though not actually suffering from the specific fever, complained of sore throat, headache, shivering, and the concomitant symptoms of scarlet fever. The following is an account of the outbreak On the 23rd of January, a parishioner requested the Sanitary Inspector to disinfect some rooms recently occupied by one of the servants, who had been sent to the ( 65 ) London Fever Hospital suffering from scarlet fever. At the same time the inspector was informed that there were numerous other cases of scarlet fever in that neighbourhood. On inquiry, it was stated that thirty.four of the forty.three infected houses were supplied with milk, and some with bread, from one dairy ; and it was also reported that a milk porter employed there, but not sleeping on the premises, had suffered from a mild attack of scarlet fever, as well as three of his children. As soon as I obtained this information, I investigated this milk supply, both at the farm and at the dairy. Inspection of the Farm, and the Condition of the Milk before it was received at the Dairy. I twice visited the farm, accompanied by several medical authorities, and after searching inquiries, we failed to detect any evidence of infectious disease, either amongst the animals, or the people about the farm. In addition, the local medical practitioners had no knowledge of any cases of fever near that district, and a veterinary certificate was supplied as to the health of the cows. I subsequently made inquiries at the railway station in London where this milk supply was received daily from the farm, and ascertained that several of the company's servants were absent from duty during January suffering from scarlet fever; and it was stated these servants purchased their milk from the consignment allotted to the dairyman in this district. But this portion of the milk was measured and sold at the station from one of the churns as it was received direct from the farm. e ( 66 ) Inspection of the Dairy and the Condition of the Milk before it was delivered to the Public. The dairy was inspected and found to be in good sanitary order; the dairyman's family and servants were all in good health, with the exception of the milk porter previously mentioned. Three of this man's children had scarlet fever, and there is little doubt but that the man himself had a mild attack of the disease. As soon as the illness was known, the children were removed to Stockwell Fever Hospital, and the man was prohibited from attending his work. The Cause of the Outbreak. The inquiry into the origin and spread of the disease is very difficult. Was it caused by the milk porter? or was it caused by milk cither infected at the dairy or the farm ? The Milk Porter. This man and his children were attacked with scarlet fever about the same date when so many of the patients were attacked on the 15th of January, the beginning of the outbreak. Of 34 of the 43 infected houses supplied from his master's dairy, he delivered milk only at 5 of the infected houses, and Neville's bread at 8. Now it is difficult, with the fact of the simultaneous attack of the milk porter and his children with those attacks of the families in the neighbourhood to conclude that he caused the outbreak, and as difficult to infer that ( 67 ) his presence at 13 only of the 43 infected houses could have extended the outbreak to the other 30 bouses. The Milk at the Dairy. The milk porter was the only one attacked on the establishment; he suffered from a slight attack, and his children suffered from ordinary attacks ; being daily occupied at the milk shop, he was a centre of contagion, and could have communicated fever to persons brought in contact with him. Could this man have infected the milk at the shop ? This question I am unable to solve. If he could, it then appears that milk has a stronger affinity for the poison of infectious disease than is supposed by medical authorities. The Milk at the Farm. No disease could be traced at the farm and its surroundings ; but, if the evidence is reliable respecting the illness amongst the staff at the railway terminus, it implies the possibility of the milk being infected before it reached the dairyman's shop. Whether the milk was so infected, either at the farm, or in transit, the cause is not obvious. Much sympathy is due to the dairyman, who throughout the inquiry behaved in the most straightforward and honourable manner. Sanitary Work. In Table VI. in the Appendix will be found a summary of the sanitary work for the past year. Some of the improvements there tabulated were carried out under the supervision of the sanitary inspector without any official e 2 ( 68 ) forms being served on the owners; but in the others, 1,012 requests and 420 statutory notices were issued before the nuisances were abated. Legal Proceedings were taken against the owners of 17 houses for not complying with your orders; convictions with costs were obtained in all cases, and the magistrates ordered the defendants to carry out the necessary works. Houses Unfit for Human Habitation.—On inspection nine houses were found to be so dangerous to health and unfit for human habitation, that a magistrate's order was obtained for closing them until they were rendered habitable. Overcrowding.—60 notices were served on owners to reduce overcrowding in their premises, which orders were promptly obeyed. Underground Dwellings.—Six underground rooms, illegally used for sleeping, were closed upon notices being given to the owners of the premises. Common Lodging Houses.—There are 65 common lodging houses in the district, registered to accommodate 2,385 persons, vide Appendix, Table XII. Several cases of infectious disease, especially small.pox, Avere reported amongst the inmates during the past year. The patients were speedily removed to hospitals, and the rooms, bedding, &c., thoroughly disinfected. Sergeant Mallett, in charge of these houses, is an energetic officer, and is most obliging in carrying out my orders respecting infectious sickness. Inspection of Unwholesome Meat, Food, &c. Complaints having been made as to the unwholesome condition of meat, fruit, fish, &c., exposed for sale during ( 69 ) the hot weather in the shops, and on the costermongers' barrows, the "Market Streets" about Seven Dials were frequently visited by the Sanitary Inspectors, and on the 19th June, a piece of decomposed and stinking meat was found exposed for sale at a small butcher's shop in Little Earl Street; the meat was seized by the Inspector, and condemned by the Magistrate as unfit for human food. Proceedings were subsequently taken against the owner of the shop, who was convicted and fined 20 shillings and costs. Various parcels of fish, rabbits, and fruit, were brought to the stone yard and destroyed at their owners' request. By order of your Board, bills were printed and posted about the "Market Streets," cautioning persons against selling diseased or unwholesome food, and the penalty they were liable to for so doing. The occasional issuing of these bills no doubt acts beneficially in checking the exposure and sale, by costermongers and others, of articles unfit for human food. Animals so kept as to be a Nuisance. A number of rabbits were found in a kitchen, causing a stench injurious to the health of the inmates of the house. The Sanitary Inspector complained to the owner, who forthwith removed the nuisance. Slaughter.houses. On the 26th October, the Middlesex Magistrates, at their Petty Sessions, held at the Holborn Town Hall, granted licenses for slaughter.houses to the following butchers, who had previously carried out the works ordered by your ( 70 ) Sanitary Committee, and which works were supervised by your Surveyor:— Slaughter.houses. Licenses. No. 6, Drury Lane Mr. Elan. „ 23, Storr Street Mr. Belch. „ 11, Kenton Street Mr. Dunford. „ 11, Marchmont Street Mr. Vincett. „ 36, do. do. Mr. Dobbins. The license to No. 19, Compton Mews, was objected to by the Inspector of the Metropolitan Board of Works, on the ground that no animal had been slaughtered on the premises for a period of 9 months (Vide sect. 13, 37 & 38 Vict. ch. 67, Slaughter.houses, &c.). Mr. Philp, the owner, not being in attendance, the case was adjourned until the 6th January, 1882, and as Mr. Philp did not appear to support his application, the license was refused. Cow.houses. Licenses were granted also on the 26th October, to the undermentioned cow.keepers :— (1.) Mr. Rees Lewis, of No. 1, Coal Yard, to keep 10 cows, in a cow.house 28 ft. x 17 ft. x 15 ft. = 7,140 cubic feet. (2.) Messrs. Bonner and Capper, of 56, Great Coram Street, to keep 6 cows, in a cow.house 29 ft x 16 ft. x 8 ft, = 3,712 cubic feet. ( 71 ) (3.) Messrs. Bonner and Capper, of 19, Tavistock Mews, to keep 11 cows, in a cow.house 24 ft. x 22 ft. x 10 ft = 5,280 cubic feet. Bakehouses.— Notwithstanding that the Factory and Workshop Act of 1878, by repealing the Bakehouses' Regulation Act of 1863, is said to take the inspection and supervision out of the hands of the local sanitary authorities, the Sanitary Inspectors were directed by me to visit the bakehouses regularly, and to report on any existing nuisance or want of cleanliness in them ; the 19th Section of the Sanitary Act of 1866, as it now stands, giving the sanitary authority full power to visit any factory or workshop in the District. Rag and Bone Shops.—These shops were duly visited, and, whenever any business nuisance was discovered, it was promptly abated by the owner, at the Inspectors' request. The retirement of Mr Cull from your Board, will be especially felt in the Sanitary Department, where he so long and ably filled the post of Chairman of Committee. I beg to acknowledge the valuable assistance and advice which he rendered me at all times in the performance of my official duties. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, S. R. LOVETT, Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, Edin., &c. Member of Council of Society of Medical Officers of Health. June, 1882. Medical Officer of Health for the District. APPENDIX.

TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, During the year ending on the 31st of last March, I received from your Inspector, Mr. Hoyle, 292 samples for analysis, consisting of bread, butter, lard, flour, cheese, milk, tea, coffee, coffee substitute, sugar, pickles, mustard, pepper, vinegar, brandy, rum, gin, sweets, preserved green peas, arrowroot, sago, castor oil, cod liver oil, iodide of potassium, and hydrate of chloral. Of these samples sixteen were found to be adulterated; namely, ten of milk, three of butter, one of mustard, one of coffee, and one of gin. The proportion of adulterated articles, therefore, has amounted to 5.4 per cent. of the whole; but it will be seen that the principal part of the adulterations have been in the article of milk. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, T. REDWOOD. 17, Bloomsbury Square, 1st August, 1882.
