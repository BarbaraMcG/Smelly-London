C139 1 Mr Cmada Dai 5B 2 helrary (1) ACTOW Act 57 BOROUGH OF ACTON ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TOGETHER WITH THE REPORT ON THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS FOR THE YEAR 195 4 BOROUGH OF ACTON ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TOGETHER WITH THE REPORT ON THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS FOR THE YEAR 1954 2 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1954 Public Health Department, Town Hall, Acton, W.3 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Acton. Ladies and Gentlemen, In submitting this Annual Report for 1954 I should like to draw attention to the very satisfactory position of the death rate of children under one year. In all there have been 16 deaths of children under one year, and this gives a mortality rate of 16.4 which, when compared with last year's figures of 25.7, shows a marked decrease. In the year 1900 approximately 168 children died to 1,000 live births, and one is able to realise that some great factor has occurred to bring about this great change. I believe this has really been due to the education of the public and the provision of ante-natal and child welfare clinics, for most of the deaths that occurred in this group during the year were due to some congenital defect of the child, or prematurity, which are not controllable by medical science at the moment. Two deaths of infants were due to gastro-enteritis; in 1900 forty-eight children died from this disease. This is really a very satisfactory record to place before you. With regard to infectious disease, there were 2 cases of poliomyelitis during the year and 87 cases of measles, which is small compared with the previous year, when there were 546 cases of measles, 3 I give below a table showing the number of cases of cancer of the lung or bronchus which have occurred during the year, in comparison with the figures for the years 1952 and 1953. DEATHS FROM CANCER OF THE LUNG AND BRONCHUS— 1952 to 1954 Year Total 25—45 45—65 65+ Bronchus Lung Bronchus Lung Bronchus Lung M. F. M. F. M. F. M. F. M. F. M.

It is interesting to note that cancer of the mouth and tongue is not so common as thirty to forty years ago, when cancer of the mouth was attributed to smoking strong varieties of tobacco. The Council decided to increase the staff of sanitary inspectors by one in April 1954. This post was advertised, but it has not yet been filled. With the resignation of one inspector to take up the position of District Sanitary Inspector at a County Borough, we are now left with 7 district inspectors to do the work of the town, which is not easy as there is such a large commitment for daily inspection of slaughtered animals at the largest slaughterhouse in Middlesex. Should any more inspectors resign and we be unable to fill their vacancies it will be difficult to carry on the work in a satisfactory way. I should like to take this opportunity of expressing to the staff of the Public Health Department my appreciation of their cooperation and loyalty throughout the year. I remain, Your obedient servant, George E, B. Payne. 4 LIST OF CONTENTS Introduction 2 List of Staff 5 Section A.—Statistics and Social Conditions 6 Section B.—General Provision of Health Services in the Area 13 Section C.—Health Services Provided by Middlesex County Council 15 Section D.—Infectious and other Diseases, Scabies and other Conditions 19 Section E.—Housing 25 Section F.—Sanitary Circumstances of the Area 27 Section G.—Inspection and Supervision of Food 35 Section H.—Diseases of Animals 45 Section J.—Atmospheric Pollution 45 Annual Report of the School Medical Officer 49 5 STAFF Medical Officer of Health George E.

Consequently it is not strictly possible to compare the birth and death rates for Acton with those for England and Wales. 13 SECTION B GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES IN THE AREA LABORATORY FACILITIES These continue as in previous years. The Ministry of Health Emergency Medical Service provides a Pathological Service at the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital Laboratory at Ealing. The following Table gives the types, and number, of specimens submitted for examination. No. of specimens Type examined Throat and Nose Swabs 138 Urine 6 Sputum 3 Faeces 167 Hair, Widals, etc. 4 Milk 53 Milk Bottles 22 Water 41 Ice-Cream 97 Cream 1 HOSPITAL PROVISION The Regional Hospital Board of the N.W. Metropolitan Area, which includes Acton, is responsible for hospital treatment of the sick. The most difficult cases for which to obtain treatment are old persons or chronic sick who become acutely ill or who are in the terminal stage of their illness. These types of cases need continuous care and treatment, and it is just these requirements which cannot be met in the home, 14 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 Under Section 47 of this Act power is given to the Councils of County Boroughs and County Districts to apply to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction for an Order for removal and detention, in a suitable hospital or other place, of persons who (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease, or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions; and (b) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not ceiving from other persons, proper care and attention. Several cases were brought to our notice during the year and in most of these it was possible by co-operating with the local hospital to arrange for the persons concerned to be admitted. However, in one case it was found necessary to take action under Section 47. This case concerned a woman aged 84 years. When I visited, following a complaint, I found that her clothes and bedding were dirty and foul smelling. Her rooms were dirty and did not appear to have been cleaned for months. The gas stove had not been used for cooking and I could find no utensils. I interviewed two daughters and a son, and asked them to help their mother, but conditions worsened so I decided that it would be in the woman's interest if she was removed to an institution. An Order was applied for but the woman was eventually persuaded to enter an institution voluntarily, where she died shortly after admission. At the beginning of the year there was one male patient already in an institution as the result of an Order made by the Court under Section 47, during 1953. This Order had already been extended, but as he became a voluntary patient a further extension was not applied for during the year. The Borough of Acton carried out its obligations under Section 50 of this Act (i.e. the burial of bodies for which no other provision was made). MASS X-RAY The North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board Mass X-ray Unit continued its policy of biennial borough surveys and did not visit Acton during the year. 15 SECTION C HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY MIDDLESEX COUNTY COUNCIL AMBULANCE FACILITIES The Middlesex County Council is responsible for this service. NURSING IN THE HOME This service is administered locally by the Middlesex County Council. The number of sick persons under care in Acton during the year was 963 necessitating 29,011 visits. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE The usual services were carried on throughout the year, six clinics now serving the area. A slight increase in the number of attendances of children under 5 years of age and a considerable rise in the number of visits paid by Health Visitors to homes will be noted. CHILD WELFARE CLINICS The average attendances per session for the six Child Welfare Clinics are given below, last year's figures being shown in brackets. Avenue Road 3 sessions weekly 27.3 (24.2) Trinity Way 2 sessions weekly 37.4 (37.7) Cloister Road 2 sessions weekly 27.0 (28.0) Palmerston Road 2 sessions weekly 30.2 (28.7) Steele Road 2 sessions weekly 28.2 (27.5) Pierrepoint Road 3 sessions weekly 32.8 (34.9) Total number of children who first attended the clinics during the year, and who, on the date of their first attendance were: Under one year of age 906 Between the ages of one and five 83 16 Total number of children who attended during the year, and who, at the end of the year were:— Under one year of age 807 Over one year 1,910 Total number of attendances at Centres during the year: By children under on year of age 14,687 By children between one and five years 6,960 HEALTH VISITING Number of visits during the year by all Health Visitors working in this area:— To expectant mothers—First visits 417 Total visits 567 To children under one year of age—First visits 1,052 Total visits 3,855 To children between the age of one and five years—Total visits 5,079 MIDWIFERY SERVICE Domiciliary Midwifery was performed as in previous years by the Midwives of Queen Charlotte's Hospital. Only 16.8% of the total births were home confinements. The bulk of the hospital confinements were accepted at Central Middlesex and Queen Charlotte's Hospitals, the table below giving the distribution:— Central Middlesex Hospital 38.3% Queen Charlotte's Hospital 30.8% Hammersmith Hospital 6.7% Other Hospitals 6.4% Nursing Homes 1.0% Confined at home (Queen Charlotte's midwives attending) 16.8% 17 ANTE-NATAL CLINIC Avenue Road Wednesday afternoon Cloister Road Alternate Friday mornings Palmerston Road Wednesday morning Pierrepoint Road Alternate Thursday mornings Trinity Way Alternate Thursday mornings The following table shows the number of attendances made throughout the year: Number of new cases attending during the year 619 Total number who attended during the year 720 Total number of attendances made 2,587 Average number who attended per session 14.2 POST-NATAL CLINICS There were no specific post-natal clinics as the majority of patients returned to hospital for this examination. The domiciliary cases who had been attended by Queen Charlotte's Midwives also I attended the post-natal clinic at the hospital. Only one woman attended the local ante-natal clinic for her post-natal examination. ANTE-NATAL EXERCISES Avenue Road One session weekly. Pierrepoint Road One session weekly. 79 new patients were taken on during the year and there was a itotal of 749 attendances, an average of 7.5 per session. PREMATURE INFANTS Number of Premature Live Births (a) In Hospital 54 (b) At Home 3 (c) In Private Nursing Homes 2 59 18 Number of Premature Stillbirths (a) In Hospital 8 (b) At Home 1 (c) In Private Nursing Homes - 9 Live Premature Births TOTAL Died with- Died between Surviving in 24 hrs. 1st day and at end of 28th day 28 days Born in Hospital 54 6 — 48 Born at Home 3 — — 3 Born in Nursing Home 2 — — 2 BIRTH CONTROL CLINIC As in previous years, arrangements for this purpose with the North Kensington Women's Welfare Association were continued. One clinic weekly was held at the Palmerston Road Hall, South Acton, a nominal fee being paid to the County Council for the use of the premises. Two new patients were referred for advice in 1954. HOME HELP SCHEME At the end of the year there were 5 full-time Home Helps, and 59 part-time Staff. The following table shows the number of cases actually attended:— Maternity 43 Tuberculosis 31 Chronic Sick 322 Other cases attended 72 DAY NURSERIES Attendances at the three remaining nurseries were noticeably higher than in 1953 and the numbers on the registers at the end of the year were more satisfactory. The closure of Bennett Street Nursery at Chiswick resulted in the transfer of a certain number of Chiswick children to Longcot, while the resettlement of Horn Lane children at St. Dunstan's and Bollo Bridge consolidated the attendances at these nurseries, 19 SECTION D INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES, SCABIES AND OTHER CONDITIONS DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION Immunisation was carried out along the lines indicated in previous reports, the following routine being practised:— (1) All infant welfare attenders were approached at 6 months. (2) A notice was sent to the parent of each 8 months old child.. (3) All children admitted to Day Nurseries were given protection. (4) Health Visitors combed their districts for children who did not attend Welfare Centres, and urged their protection. (5) Head Teachers gave forms of consent to new school entrants. (6) Prior to school medical inspections, questionnaires were sent to each parent asking, inter alia, whether the child had been inoculated. If the answer was in the negative a form of consent was sent to the parent. All immunised cases were followed up and, at the end of three years, each child was offered a boost dose. At the age of 11 years or over, this was preceded by a Schick test. All children under 5 who had not had the disease, were inoculated against Whooping Cough at the same time as they were inoculated against Diphtheria, i.e. they had three doses of protective material at monthly intervals. 20 Owing to the fact that estimates of child population are no longer supplied by the Registrar General, it is not possible to give the proportion of children immunised against Diphtheria, but the actual number at 31st December, is as follows: Children under 5 years of age 2,793 Children 5 to 15 years of age 8,606 The figures of work carried out during 1954 are given below: DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION, 1954 Total number of under 5s inoculated 759 Total number of over 5s inoculated 48 Boost dose after 3 years 1,419 Schick Test after 3 years—Negative — — 375 Positive- — 29 Primary Schick Test —Negative — — 7 Positive - — 4 21 CASES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE NOTIFIED DURING THE YEAR (Corrected).

The decrease was mainly due to the fact that there were only 87 cases of measles notified compared with 546 last year. The total notifications and the number of measles notifications were the lowest for ten years. Diphtheria One case of diptheria occurred during the year in a Jamaican nurse aged 18, who had not been immunised against the disease, having only recently arrived in this country. She had a sore throat for two weeks before admission to hospital and virulent diphtheria bacilli were isolated. Negative swabs were obtained from contacts and no further cases occurred in the nurses' home or hospital wards. The case was uncomplicated and she was discharged from hospital after four weeks' treatment. Food Poisoning During the year 8 cases of food poisoning were notified, none of them being associated with an outbreak. In two cases the causative agent was found to be salmonella organisms, the agent not being discovered in the remainder. Scarlet Fever Cases continue to be of a very mild character. Of the 86 cases notified only 13 were removed to hospital. 23 TUBERCULOSIS Age Periods NEW CASES DEATHS Respiratory Non-Respiratory Respiratory Non-Respiratory Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female 0 — — — — — — — — — 1 — — — 1 — — — — — 5 — 1 — 1 — — — — — 16 — 4 2 1 — — 1 — — 25 — 6 3 1 2 — — 1 — 35 — 3 6 1 3 3 — — — 45 — 6 1 — 4 1 — — — 55 — 4 2 1 — 3 2 — — 65 upwards 1 1 — 1 — — — 1 25 15 6 10 7 3 1 1 24 STATEMENT OF PARTICULARS APPEARING ON THE REGISTER OF CASES OF TUBERCULOSIS—1954.

Nine of these were referred for treatment by the medical staff of factories within the Borough. Three persons were treated for scabies, and three persons for body lice.

Temporary Prefabricated, Dwellings. Occupied 31.12.54 2083 During the year 24 temporary dwellings were removed from 3 sites to make way for permanent development. 71 permanent dwellings will be provided in their place. 27 Sew Permanent Dwellings.

The whole of the population is supplied from the public water mains direct to each house and the supply has been satisfactory. Waste of water has been notified to the Metropolitan Water Board on 77 occasions and, in addition to saving a measure of water supply, these notifications have been the means of preventing nuisance from dampness in many cases. In addition to the public supply, there are three deep wells in the district, two at factory premises, and one at the Public Baths. Samples of water from these wells have been taken from time to time and on submission to bacteriological and chemical examinations have proved satisfactory. In the course of the year a total of 39 samples of water were submitted to the Council's analyst or pathologist for examination as to chemical or bacteriological content. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE All the dwelling houses are provided with water closets and are : connected to the sewerage system which discharges, by an arrangement with the L.C.C., into the London sewers. Stormwater is filtered and emptied into the Thames. 28 PUBLIC CLEANSING The amount of house refuse collected by the Council in 1954 was 19,731 tons and trade refuse collected amounted to 1,587 tons. All was removed to controlled shoots. In addition to the foregoing, 2,475 tons of salvage were sold. RODENT CONTROL Test baiting of public sewers and treatment as necessary have been continued in accordance with the recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. The services of the Council's Rodent Destruction staff have been divided as occasion has demanded between destruction of newly discovered rats and mice by intensive treatment, and the regular visiting, examination and treatment of business premises to prevent infestation. There is no serious infestation of rats or mice in the Borough, and there can be no doubt that this is largely due to the Council's policy and practice of maintenance treatment in business premises, particularly those where food for human consumption is manufactured or stored. Investigation, destruction and maintenance have entailed a total of 4,882 visits by the Rodent Operatives, 2,175 to business premises and 2,707 to dwellings, in addition to inspections by the Sanitary Inspectors as noted elsewhere. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1931 Under the above Act, sixteen premises are registered for the manufacture of articles of upholstery, toys, etc., and two premises were licensed for the storing of rag flock. In the course of inspections it has been noted that rag flock and other filling materials are stored and used so as to be maintained in hygienic condition. COMPLAINTS The number of complaints registered at the counter was 1,389, and by letter 153. 29 INSPECTION OF FACTORIES The number of factories in the Borough has fallen to 632 and these have been subject to inspection by the Sanitary Inspectors to ascertain that the provisions of the Factories Act, 1937, and regulations as to sanitary accommodation are complied with. The usual work of inspection of factory canteens has been maintained, and advice given as necessary as to fitness or otherwise of food for human consumption. The home addresses of 224 outworkers engaged in work at home for Factories within and outside the Borough, have been visited to ascertain hygienic conditions and freedom from infectious disease. During the year outworking in the matter of sweet wrapping was engaged in for the first time by two sweet manufacturers in the Borough, and of the addresses noted above, sweet wrapping was carried on at 195. In a number of cases the health of the inmates or the conditions in the homes were not desirable and the firms withdrew the work from these premises at the request of the Sanitary Inspector. In the main it may be said that the wrapping and incidental handling of food in private dwelling houses intended for sale for human consumption is not to be commended, as the promotion and control of good general and hygienic conditions are not readily attainable. 30 FACTORIES ACT, 1937 PART I OF THE ACT 1.

During the 32 year 63 Notices were passed to the Town Clerk for work to be done in default of owners. The following table indicates the extensive and varied nature of the defects and dilapidations which have been made good following inspection by the Sanitary Inspectors. Sanitary dustbins provided 116 Yards paved or yard paving repaired 8 Insanitary forecourts remedied 2 Defective drains repaired or reconstructed 25 Defective soil pipes and ventilating shafts repaired or renewed 10 Defective fresh air inlets repaired or renewed 18 Defective gullies removed and replaced by new 1 Rainwater downpipes disconnected from drain 1 Dishings or curbs to gully repaired or new gratings fixed 13 Defective W.C. pans and traps removed and replaced by new 311 Defective W.C. flushing apparatus repaired or new fixed 30 Defective W.C. seats repaired or new fixed 21 Defective flush pipe connections repaired 11 Insanitary sinks removed or new fixed 22 Sink waste pipes repaired or trapped 28 Insanitary wall surface over sinks remedied — 7 Ventilated food cupboards provided 31 Drinking water cisterns cleansed 51 Defective covers to drinking water cisterns repaired or new fixed 6 Insanitary sites beneath floors concreted 3 Spaces beneath floors ventilated 19 Dampness in walls from defective damp proof coursing remedied 89 Dampness from defective roof, rainwater gutterings, etc., remedied 634 33 Defective plastering repaired (number of rooms) 426 Rooms where dirty walls and ceiling have been cleansed and redecorated 633 Defective floors repaired 76 Defective or dangerous stairs repaired 13 Defective doors and windows repaired 516 Defective kitchen ranges and firegrates repaired 163 Defective washing coppers repaired 1 Coal cupboards provided or repaired 3 Accumulations of offensive matter removed 2 Drains unstopped and cleansed 44 Drains tested, exposed for examination, etc. 179 Smoke observations and inspections made 67 Smoke nuisance abated on service of notice 3 Miscellaneous nuisances abated 81 New W.C. apartments 2 Verminous rooms disinfected 109 RENT RESTRICTIONS ACT Applications received 44 Applications withdrawn 4 Applications refused 1 Certificates granted to occupiers 39 Applications for certificates of revocation — Certificates granted to owners — PREMISES UNDER PERIODICAL INSPECTION Factories and Workshops 632 Piggeries 2 Rag Dealers 5 Mews 4 Pub'.ic House Urinals 34 Hairdressers 45 34 School Buildings: — Grammar 1; Primary and Secondary 11; nical 2 ; Special 1; Private 3 ; Total 18 Butchers' Shops 35 Fish Shops 24 Fish and Chip Shops 16 Greengrocers' Shops 89 Grocery and Provision Shops 154 Milk Shops 42 Bakehouses 20 Slaughterhouses 2 Restaurants, Cafes, etc. 129 Industrial Canteens 203 Horseflesh (human consumption) shops 2 Premises where ice-cream is manufactured 6 Premises where ice-cream is sold 122 Premises registered under Section 14, Food & Drugs Act, 1938 (other than Ice-Cream premises): — Manufacture of sausages 29 Manufacture of sausage casings 1 Manufacture of pies 2 Preparation of pickles 2 Preparation of preserves 2 Preparation of lard 1 Curing of bacon 3 Smoking of fish 1 Preserving of meat 5 Potting of meat 2 Canning of fruit 1 - Total 49 Dairies registered under the Milk & Dairies Regulations, 1949:— 2 The large increase in time spent by the Sanitary Inspectors on meat inspection at the slaughterhouses is reflected in the reduction of work referred to in this Section of the report. The difficulties in the Department have been accentuated by the inability to fill a vacancy and by further reduction in the inspectorial staff as a result of resignation. 35 SECTION G INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD The numbers and types of food premises in the area are noted under Section "F" of the report, as are the numbers of food premises by type registered under Section 14 of the Food & Drugs Act, 1938 and the number of dairies registered under the Milk & Dairies Regulations, 1949. Inspections of registered food premises are carried out from time to time and further action taken as necessary to ensure the premises and method of production being maintained at a satisfactory standard. Members of the Sanitary Inspectors staff from time to time give lectures with film strip displays to stimulate and maintain interest in food hygiene and the general work of the Public Health Department. DISPOSAL OF CONDEMNED FOOD There have been no changes in the methods of disposing of condemned and surrendered food noted in the report. At the large slaughterhouse and bacon factory in the Borough all diseased or unfit carcases, parts of carcases and offal are destroyed under the supervision of the Council's Meat Inspectors in a special plant producing inedible material—bone meal, fertilizer, etc. The rest of the surrendered diseased and unsound food material is disposed of either for animal feeding purposes or by burning in a destructor as appropriate. FOOD INSPECTION Reference to special examinations of consignments of food follow in this section of the report and while details of the quantity condemned are noted, it is not practicable to collate total quantities. The amount of food-stuffs surrendered owing to deterioration or damage is largely related to the extensive work of food manufacture and distribution in the Borough. Much inferior food material is received into the Borough for manufacturing purposes on licence by Port Health Authorities and subject to control by this Local Authority, and the Sanitary 36 tors carry out necessary examinations to ensure that only sound material is used. There are two large wholesale grocery Depots within the Borough, and hence surrenders of canned and packetsd goods are made to this Authority; these surrenders constitute the major part of such foodstuff noted. The following list collated for convenience shows some details of the surrendered food-stuffs: Bakers' Sundries 473 lbs. ,, 15 packets Cereals 120 packets ,, 21 lbs. Cheese 41bs. 7½ozs. Cream 27 tins Fish, wet 2 cwts. 2qrs. 0st. 41bs. ,, tinned 677 tins ,, shell 22 Fruit, tinned 19,334 tins ,, dried 2,994 lbs. fresh 20½ bushels Ham, tinned 1,062 lbs. Meat: — Fresh 74,039 lbs. Tinned 1,479 tins Corned beef 111 tins Offal 151 lbs. ,, 25 tins Sausages and Sausage Meat 11,096 lbs. Milk, Condensed 2,021 tins Pastes, Pickles, etc. 88 jars 37 Poultry: — Chickens 42 lbs. Turkey 19 lbs. Preserves 1,837 tins Puddings, sweet and savoury 9 tins Soup, Strained Foods, etc. 985 tins Sugar 139½ lbs. Vegetables 4,398 tins Miscellaneous 2 tins ,, 3½ lbs. ,, 75 packets FOOD COMPLAINTS There were 27 complaints as to contaminated or unsound foods and in five cases the Council decided to institute legal proceedings against the firms who sold the food which formed the subjects of complaints; three were in relation to foreign bodies in bread, one referred to a cream-filled gateau which was mouldy, and in the final case a foreign body in wrapped toffee. The respective firms were fined, as intimated below, and the Council were awarded costs as noted: — A firm of bakers was fined £10 in respect of a wholemeal loaf containing a cigarette end and £10 in respect of a loaf containing a small piece of iron. The costs totalled £25 in these two cases. Another firm of bakers was fined £20—costs £3 3s in respect of a loaf containing adhesive surgical plaster. Yet another firm of bakers was fined £25—costs £15 15s.— in respect of a cream-filled gateau in a mouldy (penicillium) condition. A wholesale firm of sweet manufacturers were fined £2 2s.— costs £2 2s.—in respect of a piece of wrapped toffee containing a small metal bolt. In a number of other cases the Council took suitable warning action against the offenders. 38 Milk The number of dairies in the Borough has been reduced to two owing to the increasing practice of distributing milk wholesale in bottles from large bottling depots to local depots, for delivery by roundsmen, or over the counter in milk shops. Of 53 samples taken throughout the Borough and submitted to the Pathological Laboratory of the Ministry of Health, all were satisfactory. The wholesale, pasteurising and bottling centre in Bollo Lane has continued in operation without cause for complaint, and 22 empty bottles taken from the filling lines for examination as to sterility, were found to be sterile. The following licences were granted under the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasturised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations 1949 to 1953, and the Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations 1949 to 1954. Dealers' Licences: — Tuberculin Tested Milk 20 Pasteurised Milk 31 Sterilised Milk 28 Supplementary Licences: — Tuberculin Tested Milk 12 Pasteurised Milk 13 Sterilised Milk 13 117 ICE-CREAM The number of manufacturers of ice-cream in the Borough is now 6. Each of them is equipped to produce pasteurised ice-cream, and production is in every way in accord with the Ice-Cream 39 (Heat Treatment etc.,) Regulations, 1947/1952. There are 122 premises where ice-cream is not manufactured, but where the commodity is sold in the main from pre-packed stocks. During the year 97 samples were taken, 54 of ice-cream manufactured in the Borough, and 43 from shops or itinerant vendors trading in icecream manufactured outside the Borough. The grading of samples noted below and expressed in percentages indicates the very good standard of ice-creams manufactured in the Borough. Grade I 88.9% Grade II 7.4% Grade III 3.7% Grade IV 0.0% Premises, plant, processing and storage conditions are well and satisfactorily maintained. MEAT INSPECTION AT SLAUGHTERHOUSES The amount of meat inspection at the two slaughterhouses in the Borough has grown during the year, and with decontrol of meat supplies in July the necessary work of meat inspection was stepped up considerably. Some 360 hours of overtime inspection duty were carried out at the slaughterhouse of T. Wall & Sons Ltd., Atlas Road, the time of this particular duty being reduced during the year as a result of night slaughtering and the introduction of shift work by the inspectors. At Western Abattoir also decontrol made again possible local slaughtering of food animals with resultant overtime in inspection duty of some 325 hours. 40 CARCASES INSPECTED AND CONDEMNED.

Two farmers were involved but no further action was taken with regard to these samples since, in each case, samples of milk from accompanying churns were found to be satisfactory. "The one irregular sample of fish was the sale of smoked 'rock salmon' for smoked haddock. Proceedings were taken but the summons was dismissed. "Two samples of liver both proved to be pigs' liver which was sold when calves liver and lambs' liver respectively had been demanded. One of the vendors responsible received an official caution whilst the other was prosecuted and fined £3 with one guinea costs. “Two samples of vinegar procured from one vendor were both non-brewed condiment sold for vinegar, and in this case an official caution was issued. “The following brief notes relate to other activities by my Council by virtue of their duties as Food and Drugs Authority in your Borough during the same period. Milk—Inspection and Sampling Special Designated Milk: "The premises of the one dealer/ processor of 'pasteuriesed' mik in your area received nine inspections and fifty-two samples of 'pasteurised' milk from that source were submitted for examination and found to be satisfactory. Tuberculosis Examination: "Forty-eight samples were submitted for such examination by animal inoculation. No adverse report was received. Merchandise Marks Act, 1887-1953 "Attention has been paid in particular to compliance with the Imported Food Orders made under the Merchandise Marks Act, 1926. In this connection the marking of origin of meat, apples, tomatoes, poultry and dried fruit was checked by 187 inspections; during which 1,018 displays or articles were examined. The only, infringements detected were of a minor nature and these were dealt with on the premises. Labelling of Food Order, 1953 "To ensure compliance with this Order, eighty-five premisess were visited and 318 articles of food were examined. No infringe- ment of substance was discovered". 45 SECTION H DISEASES OF ANIMALS Throughout the year, the Borough remained free from any outbreaks of notifiable disease. There was an outbreak of foot and mouth disease at Bedfont, Middlesex, on 7th March and the Borough was included in the infected area which was made round the infected place. This inclusion automatically imposed restrictions on the movement of animals into the Borough and all movements had to be licenced. The restrictions were removed on 22nd March by which date a total of 4,850 animals had been moved into the Borough on licence. SECTION J ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION There has been no change in the siting or in respect of the recording of the three deposit gauge and seven lead peroxide stations and analyses have been maintained throughout the year. ESTIMATION OF ATMOSPHERIC SULPHUR BY THE LEAD PEROXIDE METHOD The monthly figures for each station for the years 1953 and 1954 are shown statistically and graphically on pages 46 and 47. Again the yearly average figure—2.2—shows an increase over that of the previous year. The station with the highest monthly figure—4.53—and the highest average figure—2.58—was that at Bashley Road. The station with the lowest monthly figure—1.90—and the lowest average figure—0.68—was that at Acacia Road. DEPOSIT GAUGES The monthly figures for each station are shown statistically and graphically on pages 48 and 47. The average monthly rainfall is shown in the table on page 48. The yearly average figure—22.74 tons/square mile—shows a further slight increase over that of the previous year but there was a very slight reductio in the amount of combustible matter in the deposit. The station with the highest monthly figure—45.36 tons/sq. mile—and the highest average figure—28,26 tons/sq. mile—was Bashley Road.

During the year 9 new cases were admitted. 52 TUBERCULOSIS-SPECIAL SURVEYS During the year the Tuberculin Patch Test was applied to all new entrants in the Infants' Schools. All known contacts and children who had a primary infection prior to school entry were not included in this survey. Total number patch tested 728. Total number negative 715—6 were not read. Total number found to be positive 7. Four of the cases found to be positive had been in contact with persons in the family who suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis. Of these persons, two were unaware of their illness and hospital treatment has now been arranged for them. In the case of the other two, the parents knew that their children were in contact with a tubercular parent or grand parent. If only they had realised the danger of close contact to a young child with a person suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis and avoided it, infection of the child might have been prevented. In the three other cases the cause was unknown. Two special surveys were carried out on children who had been in contact with a classmate who developed primary tuberculosis. Ninety-six children were involved, of these 87 were negative, 7 were not tested for various reasons, one refused and one was positive. The latter case was referred to the Ealing Chest Clinic. Arrangements were also made for mass X-ray of the staff and helpers. This was carried out with satisfactory results. 53 AUDIOMETRY SCHEME The following table shows the number of children tested by Gramophone Audiometer with details of failures. All children who fail the test are examined by the Ear, Nose and Throat Specialist, who recommends the appropriate treatment. 1 2 3 FAILURES 7 4 5 6 Total of School Population in Area Total tested by Gramophone Audiometer Absentees.
