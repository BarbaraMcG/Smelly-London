Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you the statistics of births, deaths, and marriages for the year ending December 31st, 1880, and the details of our sanitary work (in accordance with the requirements of the Act of Parliament) for the year ending March 25th, 1881.

The death-rate during the past year in the district has been 18.4 per 1000 of the population. There has been a total of 5286 deaths recorded in the parish, of which 2588 were males and 2698 females. Of the total deaths, 2195 cases occurred in the eastern and 3091 in the western division of the district. The death records are singularly uneventful, and contain very little calling for special or detailed comment. The total number of deaths this year compares favourably with that of last. Notwithstanding the increase of population the actual number has been less by 35. The number of deaths from measles has been remarkably small,— indeed the smallest on record since 1861, when the population was only 155,341. The two diseases which can be in any sense regarded as epidemic have been scarlatina and whooping cough. Of the latter, February and March were the fatal months, during which the number of deaths was unprecedented. It was in the latter half of the year that the slight rise occurred in the deaths from scarlatina. MORTALITY AT DIFFERENT AGES. In the following table I have arranged according to ages the deaths that have taken place in Islington from the year 1876 to 1880 inclusive:— 1876. 1877. 1878. 1879. 1880. Under 1 year old 1,397 1,302 1,453 1,340 1,517 From 1 to 2 years 459 500 522 565 521 „ 2 to 3 „ 199 199 225 253 194 „ 3 to 4 „ 132 131 137 138 131 „ 4 to 5 „ 77 86 105 90 102 „ 5 to 10 „ 141 210 196 184 176 „ 10 to 15 „ 66 77 75 51 66 „ 15 to 20 „ 73 64 92 84 92 „ 20 to 40 „ 580 563 534 588 529 „ 40 to 60 „ 705 718 762 784 799 „ 60 to 80 „ 778 811 873 1015 961 „ 80 and upwards 182 177 184 229 198 6 The number of deaths of children under 1 year old, as the above table indicates, is still painfully large, and constitutes between one-third and one-fourth of the total mortality. The proportion is no greater than in other districts; but I confess that to my mind the death-rate of our infant population, generally, is a matter that calls for the most serious and anxious consideration both of sanitarians and legislators. Children seem to be born for little else than to be buried. Table No. IV.

This I have done so frequently that the Members of the Vestry are probably conversant with my views on the subject. Speaking with an experience that can have fallen to the lot of but very few—having analysed some hundreds of samples supplied by the Company—being familar with the New River from its commencement to its very end, and also with the works of the Company in all their detail, I can only reiterate what I have said before, and of the truth of which I have no shadow of a doubt that no better, purer, and more wholesome water could possibly be furnished to the people than that supplied by the New River Company. 10 THE "SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS," FOR YEAR, 1880. During the twelve months ending December, 1880, I examined 64 samples of food, all of which were submitted to me for analysis by your Inspectors, no sample having been submitted by the public. These consisted of— 22 Whisky 18 Brandy 12 Coffee 12 Chicory This makes in all 904 samples of food examined for Islington since my appointment. Of the 40 samples of Spirits (Whisky and Brandy) 7 were overproof 17 were 0 to 10 degrees underproof 15 were 10 to 20 degrees underproof 1 was between 20 to 25 degrees underproof In no case was the admixture of water in excess of that permitted by the 6th Section of "The Sale of Food and Drugs Act Amendment Act, 1879," which allows such dilution provided it has not reduced the Spirit more than 25 per cent, under proof for either Whisky, Brandy, or Rum. The twelve samples of Chicory were all genuine. Of the twelve samples of Coffee, two, which were declared to be mixtures at the time of their purchase, contained respectively 42 and 50 per cent. of Chicory, five samples contained quantities of Chicory in small amount, and the remaining five were pure. THE. MORTUARY AND CORONER'S COURT, 1880-81. From the 1st April, 1880, to the 31st March, 1881, 568 bodies were received at the Mortuary, the daily average being 1.56 as against 1.71 in the previous year. 303 inquests have been held during the same period, the sum of £45 17s. 6d. having been paid to the Vestry for the accommodation afforded by the Coroner's Court. 11 SANITARY WORK FOR THE YEAR, 1879-80. (Table No. VI. This table of our Sanitary Work has been prepared in the usual manner, showing, in the first part the number and variety of the inspections, re-inspections, and calls made by the District Inspectors during the year; and in the second part the amendments which have been effected. In addition to these improvements, the three District Inspectors reported during the year that dust was required to be removed from 664 houses, this number not being included in the removals ordered as the result of the special work of the Inspector of dust which will be found stated in the note at the bottom of the table. By the authority of the Sanitary Committee, carbolic acid was again employed during the summer, as in former years, for watering some of the streets. McDougall's powder was also used in the hottest and driest part of the season in the Courts, and in connection with the Sunday morning cleansing of the channels of the Essex, Caledonian, and Holloway roads, these thoroughfares being used as market places until late on Saturday night. There have been no summonses issued during the year, the work having been carried out without the necessity arising for extreme measures. These are never resorted to unless they are unavoidable. 12 THE SLAUGHTER HOUSES AND COW HOUSES IN ISLINGTON, 1880-1. At the Annual Licensing of 1880 there were 88 applications for the renewal of Licences to Slaughter Houses which were all granted. For the renewal of licences to Cow Houses, 50 applications were made, and of these 48 were granted, and 2 refused. One fresh application for a licence to keep cows was refused. 88 Slaughter Houses and 48 Cow Houses were therefore licensed. The result of my annual inspection was satisfactory. In the case of one Cowhouse, which had been rebuilt during the year, the Sanitary Committee and myself were much pleased with the cleanly appearance of the white glazed bricks that had been used for the inner lining of the walls of the Cowhouse to the height of 5 feet, an improvement first suggested from the Sanitary Department, and fortunately carried out without interference from the Metropolitan Board of Works, whose hasty patronage of cement and of a fancy patent paint as impervious materials for the inner lining of the walls of Cowhouses is much to be regretted. Islington, it is true, was the first to try cement, but it was only as an experiment, and until some better material could be found. And Islington again suggests as a further improvement the use of white glazed brick which is perhaps the one material of all others best adapted for the purpose on account of its non-absorbent character, its sightly appearance, and the readiness with which it can be washed. There can be no doubt that its general adoption both for Cowhouses and Dairies is very desirable. THE DUSTING OF THE PARISH, 1880-81. I have appended, as usual, a tabulated statement (Table No. VII), of the applications for the removal of dust during the year ending Lady-day, 1881, showing the number received during each quarter from the eight different Wards of the parish. 13 Of the total number of 13,141 received from residents during the year, 9,195 were by letter or postal card, and 3,946 were made personally, or through messengers sent to the Vestry Offices. The 13,141 applications received from the inhabitants were at the rate of 379 per cent, of the inhabited houses, against 39 5 per cent, in 1879-80. In closing my Report, I should wish to say that the Smallpox epidemic which, as I write, is upon us in all its intensity, is a matter of the greatest anxiety to your Sanitary Committee and to the officers of the Sanitary department. The history of this epidemic will be fully reported to your Vestry in due course, but it is my duty meanwhile to express to you my sense of the valuable services of your Sanitary Superintendent, and the praiseworthy activity of the Inspectors in meeting unusual calls upon their time and energy. To the Sanitary Committee both Mr. Collingwood and myself are much indebted for their ready and intelligent support. The Camp Hospital for Small Pox, which the Vestry have in their wisdom authorized, is an enormous gain to the ratepayers of the parish. One can scarcely overestimate the advantages arising from such a step. I have seen enough of its usefulness to sanction my referring to it as one of the most important of the sanitary works carried out by your Vestry for a long time past. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, C. MEYMOTT TIDY, M.B Vestry Offices, 30th June, 1881. TABLE V. DEATHS REGISTERED IN ISLINGTON DURING (Deaths of Non-Resident West. East. Causes of Death.
