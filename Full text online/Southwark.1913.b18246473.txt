Public Health Department, Town Hall, Walworth Road, S.E. Dear Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting for your consideration my twentyseventh Annual Report which deals with the vital statistics and general sanitary work of the Borough for the year 1913. The health of our inhabitants during the year has been generally good. In the latter part of the year scarlet fever of a mild type was very prevalent among children. The mildness of the attack in a large number of cases caused the complaint to be overlooked, and it was only when the peeling stage appeared that the true nature of the disease was apparent. The provisional tuberculin dispensary was carried on throughout the year by the Medical Officer of Health. The usual days and hours were devoted to the work. Many of the patients whilst undergoing the treatment were able to resume work, and were discharged as established in health after from 8 to 12 months' attendance at the dispensary. The supervision of imported food stuffs at the wharves has been admirably carried out by the Inspector charged with that work. Large quantities of unsound food have been destroyed which, without such supervision, would have been consumed by the public. The operations under the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, have not been an unqualified success. The labour has been great, but the result has been small and disappointing. I have to thank the officers who assisted me with the work. The verminous condition of many of the houses in the Borough is a serious hindrance to public health, and I believe is often the cause of the spread of infectious disease. I have to thank the staff under me for their ready assistance and the Public Health Committee for their courtesy and support. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. To the Mayor, Aldervien and Councillors of the Borough of Southwark. 2 SUMMARY OF STATISTICS, 1913.

The Registrar General's estimate of the population of the borough to the middle of 1913 was 188,487, a decline of 3,475 since the census of 1911. I should hardly have thought that the shrinkage of the population had been so great, yet it must be remembered that many of the houses in the Tabard Street Area are now empty. There are also various other sites in Rodney Road, Kennington Park Road, and in the numerous small streets of the Licensed Victuallers' Estate at the back of the New Kent Road, upon which either new buildings are being erected, or the old houses are being extensively repaired. Many of the old inhabitants prefer to spend their lives in the district, but the nomadic instinct in many of our people is very pronounced at the present time. A very large proportion of. the class comprising mechanics, clerks and skilled artisans employed in the borough reside out of the district. Whilst the remainder of them occupy the best class of workmen's dwellings, such as those of the London County Council, the Peabody and Guinness Trusts, and other first-class dwellings. As a result of this change the second class block dwellings have suffered much during the last five years, and very few of them yield a fair profit to the owners. The ordinary houses of the borough are inhabited by a much lower class of tenants than formerly. The houses are more used and, in consequence the repairs are greater in the way of cost, whilst rents in many cases have gone down as much as 15 per cent. The lot of the property owner at the present time is not a happy one. Many of the second-class block dwellings are dirty and insanitary. Much money is spent upon them, but the administration of the buildings is usually so bad and the tenements so often verminous, that clean and respectable families will not occupy them. I have advised owners of these second-class buildings to have them supervised by women, as my experience is that estates of of this kind, when supervised by capable and experienced women, are better looked after and yield a better profit. I am speaking generally of second-class properties.

The number of Births registered in the Borough during 1913 was 5,681, of which 2,944 were males, and 2,737 females. This represents a birth-rate of 301 per 1,000 inhabitants. The number of births registered in the individual parishes was as follows:—Newington, 3,498; St. George the Martyr, 1,642; Christchurch and St. Saviour's, 541. Of the 5,681 births registered in the borough 54 were transferred away, the permanent residence of the parents being outside the borough. 304 births occurring in various lying-in and other institutions outside the borough, but belonging to Southwark parents, were notified to me by the Registrar-General. When the 54 "outward" transfers are deducted and the 304 " inward " transfers are added to the 5,681 births actually registered in the borough the net amount of births belonging to Southwark for the year is found to be 5,931. This gives a corrected birth-rate of 31.5. Birth-rate for the last Twenty-three Years for the Three Divisions of the Borough as formerly existed. Newington. St. George. Christchurch and St. Saviour.

Of the 2,777 deaths registered in the sub-districts of the Borough, 1,078 occurred in the Poor-Law Institutions, the various hospitals, and other public places for the treatment of the sick found within our boundaries. These deaths in institutions comprised 369 belonging to Southwark, and 709 to other sanitary districts. 42 of the deaths registered as occurring in the borough were of persons residing in other sanitary districts, but who died in our streets or on the way to hospitals. The number of inhabitants belonging to the Borough dying away from home—that is outside our boundaries in the various hospitals and infirmaries—was 1,345. Of this very large number, as many as 761 died in the Southwark Infirmary at Champion Hill. The remainder, with but few exceptions, died in the large public hospitals. When those persons who were non-parishoners, but who died in our Borough have been deducted, and the outlying deaths added, the actual or " corrected " number of deaths belonging to the Sanitary Area is found to be 3,371, of which number 1,833 were males, and 1,538 females. The death-rate when calculated on this " corrected" number is 17 9 per 1,000 inhabitants for the whole Borough for the year 191o, as against a rate of 16-8 for 1912. The percentage of persons dying away from Southwark in relation to the total number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 39 9. The various localities in which the " outlying " deaths occurred are shown in the following table. TABLE 3. Outlying Deaths, with Localities Males. Females. Total.

One supposed case of this disease was notified during the year. It was found to be one of Chicken Pox. Deaths from Small-pox during the last ten years:— 1904 1 1909 — 1905 — 1910 — 1906 — 1911 — 1907 — 1912 — 1908 — 1913 SCARLET FEVER. The increased prevalence of Scarlet Fever since the middle of August, 1913, continued longer than is usual with the ordinary increase of the complaint noticed every autumn. The usual tendency of Scarlet Fever is to increase in prevalence about the middle of August of each year, and to continue in more or less severity until the middle of November, when it gradually subsides to the ordinary proportions of the rest of the year. It was noticed last autumn, however, that the decline in the severity of the complaint did not commence at the period it is usually looked for ; this most likely was due to the mildness of the winter. Scarlet Fever is thought to be spread mainly by personal contact; the glands of the mouth and throat being the chief means of its propagation. I have noticed for a long time past that Scarlet Fever in Southwark, in regard to its incidence, has usually a cycle of five years. The last cycle has extended to seven years, as the year of the last exceptional increase was 1906. Most of the cases of Scarlet Fever occur in children under five years of age, and it might be thought that, owing to the extension of the last cycle, and there being in consequence a greater number of susceptible children in 1913, that the ages of the children attacked would be increased. This has not been found so in the recent increase of the complaint. Therefore, I think we are justified in saying that if Scarlet Fever by measures taken can be put off until a child is five years of age, the child has a very great chance of not having the disease at all. The number of cases notified, as compared with London, during the last ten years was:— In Southwark. In London. In Southwark. In London. 1904 415 13,438 1909 590 17,251 1905 776 19,461 1910 419 10,509 1906 1,470 20,329 1911 480 10,489 1907 1,275 25,925 1912 500 11,312 1908 775 22,072 1913 880 17,552 The Wards most affected were St. Mary, St. Michael, St. George and St. John. Number of deaths from Scarlet Fever during the last ten years:— In Southwark. In London. In Southwark. In London. 1904 12 365 1909 14 383 1905 28 549 1910 9 214 1906 45 533 1911 6 172 1907 35 644 1912 6 159 1908 24 548 1913 11 188 Of the 880 cases notified in the present year, as many as 857 were removed to hospital, i.e., 974 per cent., as against 98 6 per cent. for last year. 64 1913 being the height of the cycle, we find in that year that the total number of cases of Scarlet Fever was far below the total number in similar years, i.e., those years at the height of previous cycles. For instance, in the year 1913, 880 cases were notified, whilst in 1906, 1,470 cases were notified, and 1901, 1,301 cases were notified. In the ordinary course the year of expected increase was 1911, and that year in regard to the smallness of the number of cases occurring was a record year, only 480 cases being notified. This extension of the cycle most probably was not due entirely to any one cause. We have observed for many years past a gradual change in the type of the disease with regard to both its morbidity and its mortality. It has become much less dangerous. At the same time I think it is only fair that the Sanitary Authority should take a little credit for the improved sanitary condition of the Borough. The year now under consideration is the top of a cycle year for Scarlet Fever, which from various causes has been delayed for two years in its appearance. 65 The deaths in the 857 cases sent to hospital numbered 11, a mortality of 1.2 per cent. In the 23 cases treated at home, there were no deaths. It is our practice to spray the room with formalin and to strip the paper off the walls in the process of disinfection after Scarlet Fever. In the event of the room being verminous it is afterwards fumigated with sulphur. DIPHTHERIA. There has been a slight increase in the number of notified cases oi the disease when compared with the years immediately preceding. The number of deaths, however, has been the lowest on record. The cases were pretty evenly distributed throughout the borough, with the exception of St. Peter and All Saints' Wards, in each of which the cases were in excess of the usual number. The total number of cases notified, including Membranous Croup was 327, as against 284 for last year. The deaths from the disease numbered 19, as against 27 for 1912. The percentage of deaths to the cases notified was 5.8. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was O.l. The number of cases notified as compared with London, during the last ten years was :— In Southwark. In London. In Southwark. In London. 1904 281 7,220 1909 256 6,685 1905 304 6,482 1910 284 5,494 1906 401 8,045 1911 293 7,389 1907 422 8,771 1912 284 7,101 1908 270 8,002 1913 327 7,654 Number of deaths from Diphtheria during the last ten years:— In Southwark.

The wards most affected were in the order named. ENTERIC FEVER. The deaths from Enteric Fever in the borough during the year numbered 6, as against 4, 5 and 7. in the three preceding years. The total number of cases notified was 39 for the present year, and 39, 45 and 54, for the three preceding years. The percentage of deaths to the total number of cases notified was 154. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.03. The number of cases notified during the last ten years:— 1904 92 1909 35 1905 74 1910 54 1906 111 1911 45 1907 80 1912 39 1908 48 1913 39 The number of deaths from Enteric Fever for the last ten years:— 1904 18 1909 6 1905 11 1910 7 1906 21 1911 5 1907 11 1912 4 1908 7 1913 6 Of the 39 cases notified as many as 36 were removed to hospital, of which 4 died, a mortality of 11.1 per cent. In the 3 cases treated at home 2 died, a mortality of 66 6 per cent. The percentage of cases removed to hospital to the total number notified was 92.3. Supposed cause of the disease:— In 2 cases mussels had been eaten, in 2 cases oysters, in 1 winkles, in 1 crab, in 1 fried fish, and in one a foul cistern had been cleansed. In 67 6 cases in one family it was almost certain that the food of the family had been contaminated by one of them who had suffered from an unrecognised attack of enteric fever a few months before, and whose duty it was to prepare the food of the family. MEASLES. This disease has again exacted a very heavy toll in the year under consideration. The number of deaths is not so high as in the two years immediately preceding, but it is a very serious mortality and represents between four and five thousand cases. Given a room of a 1,000 cubic feet of air space with a lighted fire and the windows partly open and the patient in bed with warm covering, no child ought to die of measles. It is the child in the overcrowded tenement who succumbs, the victim of poverty and, in many instances, of the ignorance of the mother. Deaths from Measles during the last ten years:— 1904 191 1909 127 1905 154 1910 225 1906 95 1911 120 1907 112 1912 139 1908 77 1913 105 WHOOPING COUGH. This disease, although notifiable in some metropolitan boroughs, is not notifiable in Southwark. Like measles it is a complaint difficult to recognise at its very commencement. It is not so amenable to treatment as measles and in certain nervous children it is a grave disease. There are certain well known methods of treatment but a well ventilated, moderately warmed room of fair size is necessary for the patient. The deaths from this disease were 38 for the year. The annual death-rate per 1,000 living was 0 20. Deaths from Whooping Cough for the last ten years:— 1904 118 1909 57 1905 80 1910 60 1906 54 1911 64 1907 103 1912 49 1908 50 1913 38 68 CEREBRO SPINAL FEYER. During the year 6 cases of Cerebro-Spinal Fever were notified of which 5 died. DIARRHÆA. The year under consideration, during the months of August, September and October, was unfavourable for infants especially in regard to Diarrhæa. The deaths from that disease were above the average. All the cases were visited and inquired into. Breast feeding of babies was recommended by circularising and visiting as usual. In the poorer parts of the borough the leaflet "Precautions to be taken to prevent Summer Diarrhæa'' was widely distributed. The annual death-rate from Diarrhæa per 1,000 living was 1.09. Deaths from diarrhsea during the last ten years:— 1904 282 1909 113 1905 183 1910 90 1906 225 1911 331 1907 101 1912 95 1908 188 1913 205 TYPHUS FEVER.

The total number of disinfections of rooms during the year by the Council's disinfecting staff was 10,012. Of this number 1,484 rooms were disinfected after the occurrence of the ordinary notifiable infectious diseases, as against 1,164 rooms in 1912. 7,304 periodical sprayings of rooms occupied by Phthisical patients were also carried out during the year. 1,224 verminous rooms were sulphured and otherwise cleansed by the Council's staff during the year, as against 1,647 in 1912. Among the total number of disinfections (10,012) it was found necessary to strip 952 rooms. Of these 599 were in relation to the notifiable diseases, 340 after the termination of cases of Phthisis, and 13 were verminous. TABLE 35. The Locality of Rooms Disinfected.

During the year 2,604 persons were cleansed at the station in King James Street, as against 1.444 persons cleansed during the year 1912. Under our agreement with the London County Council, 2,532 children were cleansed, as against 1,351 cleansed during 1912. It was found necessary in a large number of cases to treat the children twice and sometimes three or four times before they were found to be effectually cleansed. Many of the children treated were suffering from Scabies.
