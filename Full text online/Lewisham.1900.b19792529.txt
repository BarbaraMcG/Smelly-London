LEW 67 REPORT to THE BOARD OF WORKS for the LEWISHAM DISTRICT, TO THE END OF THE YEAR 1900, BY Dr. S. BLAKE JOLLY, Medical Officer of Health for the District. London: E. G. BERRYMAN & SONS, STEAM PRINTERS, Blackheath Road, S.E. 1901. REPORT TO The Board of Marks for the District, TO THE END OF THE YEAR, 1900, BY DR. S. BLAKE JOLLY, Medical Officer of Health for the District. Gentlemen, The number of deaths registered as having occurred in the Lewisham District during the year 1900 was 1,942; of these, 254 were of persons who did not belong to the district. On the other hand, 94 persons belonging to the district died in hospitals and asylums outside, making the actual total of deaths 1,782, as against 1,818 in the previous year, a decrease of 36. There was, however, an increase of 5,395 in population during the year, and the death rate for 1900 was 13.1 per 1,000 as compared with 13.9 per 1,000 in 1899, and 14.0 per 1,000 in 1898. The deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs increased from 313 to 351, partly owing to Influenza, 53 deaths being directly attributed to that disease. The deaths from Zymotic disease were 220, compared with 303 in the previous year, of which 50 were due to Whooping Cough. Deaths from Diphtheria decreased from 70 to 36. 2 Population. The population of the Lewisham District at the Census of 1891 was found to be 92,647, occupying 15,643 houses. At Midsummer, 1900, there were 23,054 inhabited houses, and the population was estimated at 136,017, an increase of 5,395 in the year. Inhabited houses. Estimated population. Lee 1,235 7,286 Lewisham 10,890 64,251 Sydenham 6,904 40,733 Penge 4,025 23,747 23,054 136,017 Note.—These figures relating to the population as estimated by the number of inhabited houses, point to remarkable fluctuations, and raise doubt as to the accuracy in numbering the latter. On the basis of the number of inhabited houses, the population of the District showed an increase of 11,382 in the year 1899. The increase in 1900 only amounted to 5,395, The returns at Midsummer, 1900, show that in Lewisham there were 1,762 more occupied houses than there were at Midsummer, 1899, with a corresponding increase of population amounting to 10,396, while in Sydenham in 1900 there were 834 more empty houses than there were in 1899, with a corresponding decrease of population amounting to 4,922. With such startling variations in so short a period, it need occasion no surprise if the Census returns of 1901 of the actual population do not agree with the estimated population. Births. The registered births in the district in the year 1900, amounted to 3,245, an increase of 184 on the previous year:— Males, 1,696. Females, 1,549.=3,245. Birth-rate to population=23.8 per 1,000. The birth-rate in England and Wales in 1900 was 28.9 per 1,000 of the population, which is lower than that in any other year on record. 3 Deaths. The total number of deaths in 1900 was 1,782, as compared with 1,818 in 1899:— Males, 861. Females, 921. Total, 1,782. Death-rate to population=13.1 per 1,000. Births. Deaths. Death-rate.

Of these, 313 died in public institutions in the district, and 94 in hospitals and asylums outside. The number of non-residents who died in public institutions within the district was 254:- Residents. Non-Residents.

During the year 1900, there were 850 marriages in the Lewisham District, 59 less than in the previous year; of these there were 693 in the Parish of Lewisham, of which 459 were celebrated in various Churches, 69 in Dissenting places of worship, and 165 at the Registrar's Office. 4 In the Hamlet of Penge during the same period there were 157 marriages, of which 125 were celebrated in the various Churches, 20 in Dissenting places of worship, and 12 at the Registrar's Office. Marriage Rates. Parish of Lewisham= 12.3 Hamlet of Penge= 13.2 The Lewisham District= 12.5 Zymotic Diseases. The number of deaths from the seven principal Zymotic diseases was 220, as compared with 303 and 302 in the two previous years. The diminution is partly to be accounted for by the decrease in the deaths from Diarrhoea, this disease having been more strictly defined by the instructions of the Local Government Board, to the exclusion of many bowel complaints which were formerly included under this heading:— 1900. 1899.

The causes of death were returned as follows:— Natural causes 45 Violent deaths Accident 30 Suicide 8 Homicide 1 16 deaths were registered as "Not Certified," 5 Meteorology. During the year 1900, the mean temperature of the air at Greenwich was 50.3. The lowest temperature 18.0 occurred on Feb. 9th, and the highest 94.0 on July 16th. Rain fell on 165 days. The rainfall was 22.66 inches, which is below the average of previously recorded years by more than two inches. I am, Gentlemen, Faithfully yours, S. BLAKE JOLLY, Medical Officer of Health to the Lewisham District. 6 TABLE I. Showing the Estimated Population, Births and Deaths for the Lewisham District. Year.
