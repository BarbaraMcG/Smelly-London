Act 47 Borough of Acton ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health together with the Report on the Medical Inspection of Schools FOR THE YEAR -1944 70496 annual report of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1944 Public Health Department, Town Hall, Acton,. W.3. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Acton. Ladies and Gentlemen, I eg to submit the Annual Report on the health of the Borough for the year 1944. The Annual Report of the School Medical Service is given separately at the end. Dr. Payne, the Medical Officer of Health, has been on active service during the whole of 1944. Vital Statistics show that the birth rate in Acton is still uncreasing— being 18.8 as against 17.9 for 1943. The Infant death rate has fallen markedly—42.8 as against 62.4 for the previous year and is lower than the general rate for England and Wales-which is 46 Tables showing the percentage of infants who died during the first month of life are included in the Report and the causes of death above that prematurity accounts for more than half of these deaths. During the year, Circular 20/1944 was received from the ministry of Health which dealt with special provisions to be made for premature babies and for special notification of these cases. The Council agreed to implement all the provisions of the Circular in so far as this was possible, although provision of a separate bed- room for mother and child might not always be practicable. As far 4 as records were available for 1944, all the premature children been at home and nursed entirely at home survived the first month of life Circular 2866 from the Ministry of Health dealing with the care of illegitimate children was also put into force during the year Acton has joined with other Boroughs in a scheme drawn up by the County of Middlesex for the provision of Hostel accommodation for mothers and babies, and shares in the services of a special Social Worker on the County Council staff for dealing with such cases. There were no large outbreaks of Infectious Diseases durirg 1944, the total number of cases notified (including Tuberculosis during the year being 318. Figures for attendances at Clinics (including clinics for inoculation against Diphtheria) and Day Nurseries, dropped considerably following the large scale evacuation advised at the time of the Fly Bomb attacks, but all remained open and functioned as usual. A table showing the numbers evacuated is contained in the Report. Figures for vermin infestation and scabies showed an increase corresponding with the evacuation—a direct result of the stringent medical examination each evacuee was given before being sent out of London. The Civil Defence Casualty Service continued to be administered by the Public Health Department and all personnel carried their duties in a very satisfactory manner. During the year a cut was made in the strength of the personnel following the partical stand down of all Civil Defence Services. : Your Obedient Servants, G. E. B. PAYNE. E. MADELEY. 5 STAFF.

Pre-War 30 Attendances at all the Nurseries dropped very noticeably from Jojy onwards, owing to the large scale evacuation during the flybomb period. "Longcot" was burnt out in a raid on the night of 24.2.44. Premises at 56 Woodstock Road were used as a temporary nursery, but these were closed from the 1st July as there was inadequate skelter accommodation. "Longcot" was reopened on the 11th September. As from the 1st September 1944, the staff at Bollo Bridge Road flurseiy ceased to be residential. The rooms thus vacated increased the nursery accommodation by 5, making a total of 35 nursery places. Work was commenced on the adaptation of the building but was not completed at the end of the year. The following table gives the average daily attendances at the War-time Nurseries. Under 2 years of age. Over 2 years of age.

There were no deaths from Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria or Whooping Cough. 65 cases of Pneumonia were notified during the year, as against 81 cases in 1943. 16 Diphtheria Immunisation. Immunisation was practised as before and every effort was made to induce parents to have their children protected. The following means were employed to contact all children under 14; (a) At the age of 6 months, a notice is sent to the parents of every child whose birth was notified to the Public Health department. (b) The parents of all children attending Welfare Centres are approached. (c) All children admitted to Day Nurseries are offered protection. (d) Health Visitors, calling at the homes of children who do not attend the Welfare Centres, advise the parents. (e) New school entrants are given consent forms by the Head Teacher. (f) Prior to each schooi medical inspection, a questionnaire is sent to each parent. One of the questions asks 'Has your child been immunised against Diphtheria ?' If the answer is in the negative, a form of consent with advice re time and place for inoculation, is sent. All immunised cases are followed up, and a single injection is offered at the end of every three years in order to refresh the child's waning immunity. After the age of 11 years, this is preceded by a Schick test. For children under 5, if they have not had the disease, immunisation against Whooping Cough is combined with the Diphtheria injection. Good results appear to be obtained, injections do not always prevent the infection, but the severity of the illness is modified. During the year, 19 cases of Diphtheria were notified, and of these in 13 cases only was the diagnosis substantiated. 2 of these cases were adults, 9 school children, and 2 were children under school age. Neither of the children under school age had been immunised. Of the 9 school children 4 had been immunised, 2 in 1942, 1 in 1935 (called up for Schick test 3 years after immunisation but did not attend), 1 in 1937 (also called up for Schick test 3 years after immunisation but did not attend). There were no deaths from Diphtheria in 1944.

Tables showing the number of cases referred to the Kensington Medicinal Baths for cleansing and treatment are given below. An arrangement exists between the two Boroughs for this purpose. It will be noted that in July there was a sharp rise in the number of cases treated for verminous conditions. This coincided with the Fly Bomb evacuation of families %nd was attributable to the medical examination which was made prior to leaving London. As in previous years, the whole family was dealt with where this was possible, instead of the affected individual only, in an 22 attempt to eradicate the infestation from the home and so gives better chance of avoiding re-infestation. The Tables given have been drawn up to show the areas, times of the year, and number of families affected. PATIENTS TREATED AT KENSINGTON BATHS FOR VERMINOUS CONDITION, 1944. Mouth. Total. N.E. N.W.

Ministry of Health Circular 20/1944 was received from the Ministry in March 1944. It required various provisions to be made by Welfare Authorities for the care of premature infants in and endeavour to bring about a reduction in the neo-natal deaths due to this cause. 23 The Circular suggested that space on notification of birth cards should be provided to record the birth weight of any premature infant which was 5$ lbs. or less, and laid down conditions which their Advisory Committee considered important where the prenature baby was nursed at home. (1) Separate bedroom for mother and child. (2) Provision of adequate and suitable equipment in the home. (3) Supply of breast milk where necessary. (4) Services of a paediatrician. (5) Special attention of Health Visitors and Midwives. (6) Services of a Home Help. The Acton Borough Council decided to adopt all these recommoidations, and during the year all the recommendations were being implemented, although delivery of the necessary equipment was delayed by circumstances beyond our control. The Central Middlesex Hospital was approached, and the Middlesex County Council agreed to allow one of their staff, an experienced Paediatrician, to be available for consultation to all General Practitioners in the area on application to this Council which guaranteed the necessary fees. The attached Table is as comprehensive as is possible for 1944, having regard to the fact that for part of the year no special provision was made on the birth notification cards for such cases. PREMATURE INFANTS. Total Number Notified: 56. Born at Home: 11. Born at Hospital: 45. Nursed entirely at Home. Died in 24 hours. Survived 1 month. Died in 24 hours. Died between 1 day and 1 month. Survived 1 month. 9 — 11 7 6 32 That babies were born at heme but after birth were transferred to Hospital. Both survived 1 month. Care of Illegitimate Children. In November 1943, Circular 2866 was received from the Ministry of Health asking all Welfare Authorities to give earnest 24 consideration to the problems associated with the illegitimate child. and to do all in their power to help the mother to obtain a suitable and safe background for herself and her child. Hostel accommoda tion for the mother before and after the birth, and the services of a skilled social worker who would be able to advise mothers on all matters such as Affiliation Orders, and Adoption procedure, were the two essentials. It was realised thajt illegitimate births in Acton did not occur in sufficient numbers to justify the provision of a Hostel for the area, nor would there be sufficient work to employ a full time Socal Worker. It was calculated that only 12 to 14 mothers in Acton would require Hostel accommodation per annum. It was therefore decided to approach the Middlesex County Council with a view to their providing a scheme for the County as a whole, in which Aaton might participate. The Middlesex County Council have prepared a scheme whereby Hostel accommodation at Maryland, Hendon (14 places) and at 16 The Park, Golders .Green, is available to Acton mothers at a charge to the Council of 35/- per week per case. Both these Hostels are run and staffed by the British Red Cross Society Assessments for payment are made only on the mother in respect of the maintenance of herself and her illegitimate child,—mother and child for this purpose to be assessed as one person. The County Council already had on their staff a Special Services Almoner whose duties involved visiting in the whole of the County, area. Her services were made available for the purposes of the above Circular, to all Welfare Authorities participating in the County's scheme, of which Acton is one. Much of the work mentioned in Circular 2866, in the way of advice and assistance, is already being carried out by the Council's Health Visitors, but in particularly difficult cases it is well to have a Social Worker with special experience and a wider field of operation to call upon.

Water Supply. The Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board. The supply has been satisfactory and the whole of the population is supplied frcm the public water mains direct to each house. Drainage and Sewerage. All the dwelling-houses are provided with water closets and are drained, into the main sewerage system. By arrangement with the London County Council the sewage g discharged into the London sewers. Storm water is filtered and emptied into the Thames. Public Cleansing. The amount of house refuse collected by the Council in 1944 was 13,653 tons, of which 2,150 tons was salvage. Trade refuse collected, amounted to 1,315 tons, and a total weight of 12,818 tons was burned by Destructor. Rodent Control. Following acceptance by the Council of delegated powers from tfie Middlesex County Council under the Rats & Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919, and in pursuance of The Infestation Order 1943, intensive treatment with a view to rats and mice destruction has been carried out with good results. Further to destruction of rodents, advice is given as to measures necessary to proof premises against infestation, and lively interest and excellent collaboration has been afforded by occupiers of business premises to this end. While the destruction of vermin is of first importance, it is undoubtedly good policy for treatment to be maintained to ensure that 'casual' rats may be disposed of readily and thus infestation of any magnitude prevented. 26 Accordingly, arrangements have been come to with various occupiers of business premises for regular visitation and treatment, largely as a precautionary measure. In the course of the work generally, a total of 972 visits have been made, 562 to business premises and 410 to dwelling houses, in addition to initial inspections by the Sanitary Inspectors as noted elsewhere. Sanitary Inspection of the Area. The following Table includes the tabular statement furnished by the Chief Sanitary Inspector under Article 27 (18) of the Sanitary Officers (Outside London) Regulations, 1935.

It has been observed that during the year there has been a large reduction in the amount of foodstuffs surrendered as unfit for human food. Approximately 15,000 tins of preserved or canned food and a quantity of raw or preserved food of various kinds, has been dealt with by the Sanitary Inspectors. This amount included food and food material damaged by enemy action, and the whole was disposed of in accordance with the standing arrangement with the Ministry of Food Salvage Divisipn. The figures given register an improvement in the difficulties of transport, storage and handling of foodstuffs. 29 Included also in the figures given were large quantities of meat, aji, milk, etc., to a degree out of condition, and brought into the Borough for manufacturing purposes. This material received the tpecial and detailed attention of the Sanitary Inspectors to ensure their fitness for human food at the time of manufacture. Milk- • Regular inspection of the 14 dairies within the Borough showed these to be satisfactory, a good standard of cleanliness being maintained. At the milk bottling Depot at Bollo Lane the High Temperature Short Time process of Pasteurisation has been adopted, and samples taken at the Depot and submitted to the Phosphatase test as prescribed by the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations 1936/1941, have in. every case shown the milk to be properly pasteurised. Milk Samples. During the year 37 samples of milk have been taken from premises or roundsmen within the Borough for submission to bacteriological examination, and in every case the results of the examination have shown the milk to be satisfactory. In addition to the regular sampling of milk at the Bollo Lane Depot for Phosphatase tests, 53 samples have been taken from premises and roundsmen for the same purpose and the results in every case have been satisfactory. Diseases of Animals. Throughout the year the Borough has been free of notifiable diseases of animals, and was not included in any Schedule of Infected Areas. Slaughterhouses. The slaughterhouses at Atlas Road and Hanbury Road have been in commission throughout the year, and the carcase of every animal slaughtered has been examined as to its fitness for human food. The number of animals slaughtered is 70,735 pigs and 2,890 horses. Tables showing the details of meat and offal surrendered following examination by the Sanitary Inspectors will be found on two succeeding pages. 30 TOTAL NUMBER OF ALL CARCASES INSPECTED DURING 1944, WITH DETAILS OF SURRENDERS ON ACCOUNT OF DISEASE.

Ladies and Gentlemen, We beg to submit the following report upon the schools and the school children of Acton for the year 1944. As requested by the Ministry of Education the report will be mainly statistical and brief. All schools and school Clinics were open during the yea'r although school attendances were greatly affected by the Fly-bomb attacks in June and July. 78*2 unaccompanied children were evacuated because of this, all being medically examined, and where necessary, given treatment for verminous condition and for scabies before being sent away. Diphtheria immunisation was carried out as previously, regular takifkly sessions being conducted at the School Clinic for that purpose. The percentage of children inoculated is given for each school in a table included in the Report. The number of children on the roll at the end of the year was 3,821. 13 Nursery classes were open during the year. The number of cases of Scabies treated was slightly less than last year, which in its turn was less than the year before. Speech Therapy classes were held as before. School Nurses exercised careful supervision over the schools, paying particular attention to verminous conditions. The number of individual children found to be infected was less than in 1943. 34 Nine cases only of Diphtheria were reported amongst school children and sixteen cases of Scarlet Fever. It will be seen, there fore, that neither disease constituted a problem in 1944. Your obedient servants, G. E. B. PAYNE. E. MADELEY. INFECTIOUS DISEASES.

Owing to Enemy Action, some inspections hed to be cancelled. The general condition of the children's teeth remains fairly good, although we are in our fifth year of war. The teeth of children between the ages of three and five years are in a specially good condition. The teeth of expectant and nursing mothers still need. a lot of attention. The figures given below are of the work undertaken for the Maternity and Child Welfare cases, and for the pupils attendince the Acton County and Junior Technical Schools. Maternity and Child Welfare.

Tasker. REPORT ON SPEECH THERAPY CLINIC. During 1944 a total of 44 children have been treated at the Speech Therapy Clinic. Seven others have been interviewed of which 3 were rejected: - 1 as unsuitable for treatment. Four stammerers as being too young to benefit by clinical treatment. Four are on the waiting list. Another 6 names have been submitted by Head Teachers, but the children have not yet been examined. Of the 44 treated: — 7 were discharged, cured. 6 were evacuated or have left the district permanently. 7 have attended irregularly, and no just estimate of gress can be made. There remain 24 children who require a further course of trratment. Of these: — 14 show marked progress. 9 satisfactory progress. 1 has attended only for a very short time. At the beginning of September, 17 school departments were tsited Head Teachers reported on the progress of children already attending the clinic, and a number of new cases were examined. Attendance, on the whole, has been satisfactory and parental co-operation good. Mothers of the younger children are present duriing treatment and are thus able to supervise practice at home. Of the 7 children who attended irregularly, 3 were making good progress and will be re-admitted as circumstances permit. E. Richnell. 42 EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN. Defect. In hospital.
