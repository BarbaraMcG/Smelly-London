There has been no marked change in the incidence of disease or in the special defects discovered. The volume of work and the time spent on School Health has remained the same. The shortage of staff in the dental and psychiatric fields reflects the continuing pressures on these two departments. Even so, there has been a slight improvement in the waiting list of the Child Guidance Clinic and we have been able to recruit one dental auxiliary to the Dental Department. Health Education continues to play an important part in our work. The report of the Royal College of Physicians on Smoking and Health prompted a concentrated drive on this specific subject during the year. The amount of Health Education given to school-children is difficult of accurate statistical assessment, but it must be considerable. Dr. Hinden departs from his usual form of report and echoes all our concern with a type of congenital handicap which is environmental in origin, i.e. the defects developing in the unborn child as a result of the mother contracting German Measles. He offers the novel solution of encouraging infection amongst children, especially- girls, rather than trying to prevent it. Thus they acquire a lasting immunity against the disease and will be in no danger of passing the infection to their own unborn children when they themselves become mothers. This would be an ideal solution if one could ensure that when children are deliberately exposed to German Measles they do not pass it on to their mothers, sisters, or other women who may at that time be pregnant. There is a hope that the problems may be solved by active immun isation of all children before leaving school. A vaccine for Measles is already in being and shows great promise. Is it not, therefore, too much to hope that it will not be long before a successful vaccine for German Measles will be discovered? 9 SPECIAL SCHOOLS WILLIAM MORRIS SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF - Mr. K.S. Pegg, Headmaster, reports as follows:- "The school re opened in January 1963 with 56 on roll and during the year 7 children were admitted and 16 left. The leavers were placed as follows; Employment 7 Other schools 4 Residential Schools 2 Further training 3 "The children on roll at present are classified as follows: DEAF PARTIAL HEARING TOTAL Boys Girls Boys Girls Leyton 2 3 2(1) 2(1) 9 Ilford 2(1) 1 1 4 8 Dagenham - 2 2 - 4 Barking - - 1(1) - 1 Romford 1 - 2(2) 1 4 Forest - 1 4 3(1) 8 Harlow 2 1 - 1 4 S.E. Essex - 1 1 - 2 Walthamstow 1 1(1) 2(1) 3(1) 7 Totals 8 10 15 14 47 (Figures in brackets indicate children travelling by public transport) and are classified as follows:- Under 5 yrs 5-11 yrs 1116 yrs Total Deaf Boys 2 4 2 8 Girls 4 4 2 10 Partial Hearing Boys - 7 8 15 Girls 1 5 8 14 Totals 7 20 20 47 10 "For the first time for many years there is a waiting list and little possibility of admitting any children until September 1964. This is due to staff shortage, and is a problem which is shared with many other schools for the deaf. " In February and October, Mr. Taylor from the school Dental Clinic visited the school for dental inspections. Miss Smith the Educational Psychologist has made a number of visits to test the children. "During the year Miss Whetnall, Director of the Audiology Unit, Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital visited the school to discuss the results of binaural listening experiments which have been conducted over the past eighteen months. "Other visitors included Medical Officers from the Ministry of Education, Welfare Officers, members of the Special Schools Sub Committee, Her Majesty's Inspectors, staff and students from training colleges." MARGARET BREALEY SCHOOL FOR THE EDUCATIONALLY SUB-NORMAL Mr. L.F. Green, B.Sc. Headmaster, reports as follows; " 1963 was a year of innovation and increased activity. "In January the school roll was 91. During the year new entries totalled 24. Three girls were transferred to residential schools, two subsequently returning to Margaret Brearley School. Eight boys and six girls left and latest reports show that all are at present in employment. "Four younger children, who had been on trial, were trans ferred to the Junior Training Centre. One pupil was transferred to Secondary Modern School. I regret to report that one younger pupil died in January from cancer. •In addition to regular medical inspections by Dr. Poole and visits from Mrs. Leach, the officers of the school medical services, have as always, been speedy in giving sympathetic help where needed. "Transfer of the annexe to a hall and two classrooms on the main school site has assisted the work of our Infant teachers. School equipment continues to improve. The whole school now dines on a family pattern. " Feature of the year have been; The gaining of the second and fifth places for cooking in the Walthamstow Arts and Crafts Exhibition. This was out of 480 entries. 11 Much interest was shown by the public in a small exhibition of paintings and craft at the Book Exhibition. By various efforts, £7 was raised for Oxfam. As a result of the school Harvest Festival, twenty parcels were sent to old folk. School Sports Day was held in conjunction with the other Walthamstow Special Schools. Our younger children now have a swimming period at the Leyton Learners bath. " During the year a continued interest has been shown in After Care. The 'Wednesday Club' meets from 7 - 9.30 p.m. and is staffed by two teachers together with voluntary helpers. There has been average attendance of twenty from our over fifteen year old pupils and leavers. Three socials have been held during the year. These also help us to keep in touch with those who have left us. " In March the staff attended a two day Special Schools Conference at Corbets Tey School, Upminster. "Miss A. Hambley retired in August. Miss S. Butler holder of the Diploma in the education of handicapped pupils, was appointed in her place as deputy headmistress. Mrs. P. McGrath after taking the course in the education of maladjusted pupils, transferred to Dagenham. Mr. P. Page was appointed to the staff and Mr. A.E» Old was seconded for the University of London Diploma Course. "There has been a wide range of educational visits during the year. The staff are hoping to arrange some residential journey in 1964. " Miss J. Baldwin in her capacity as Health Visitor has given regular talks for the girls on child care. She also introduced some films on smoking. The boys saw these films as well. " Miss J. Rasor has started a speech programme in the school and visits regularly to follow up on this work. ''Many parents have visited the school for individual dis cussions with myself and class teachers. They were also invited to the Harvest Festival, Sports Day, Carol Service and Infants Party. At one special evening, a talk on the work of the school was given and films of the school shown 12 "Although there are a large number of children with special individual difficulties, I am pleased to report that they are being helped by a hard working team of teachers, backed by the various special services. To these and other friends of the school I am most grateful" . THE JOSEPH CLARKE SCHOOL FOR THE PARTIALLY SIGHTED. Mr. G.M. Williams, Headmaster reports as follows:- "During the year there have been 58 children on roll drawn from the following areas:- Essex Barking 2 Basildon 2 Chigwell 1 Chingford 2 Dagenham 10 Harlow 2 Hutton 2 Ilford 5 Leyton 4 Middle sex Edmonton 2 Enfield 1 Palmers Green 1 Loughton 2 Rainham 1 Romford 3 Stondon Massey 1 South Ockendon 4 Upminster 1 Walthamstow 7 Woodford Green 2 Tottenham 2 Wood Green 1 "Visual Acuity (Snellen) after correction in the school was as follows:- 7 children had acuity of less than 6/60 16 " " " " 6/60 12 " 6/36 10 " 6/24 11 " 6/18 " There were two young children whose Visual Acuity has not been accurately ascertained. Monocular vision only existed in 20 children "The ophthalmic conditions on entry were as follows:- Boys Girls Albinism 4 5 Aniridia - 1 Anisometropia 1 - Cataracts 12 6 Choroiditis - 1 Colomboma 1 - 13 Boys Girls Congenital Day Blindness - 1 Corneal Opacity 1 - Ectopia Lentis 2 2 High Myopia 5 - Iridocyclitis 1 - Macular Degeneration 3 - Nystagmus 1 - Optic Atrophy 3 3 Retinal Degeneration 1 1 Rentinitis Pigmentosa 2 - Uveitis - 1 37 21 "Of the children on the school roll during this year it is estimated that there were:- 10 children whose intellectual abilities were above average 27 children of average ability 11 children who were dull 10 children who were within the E.S.N, range. " As in previous years ophthalmic care and clinical supervision have been well maintained. In addition to many children being seen by their own ophthalmic specialists, Dr. I. Gregory, M.B., D.O.M.S., made visits in June and November seeing all new admissions, all potential leavers or transfers and gave much helpful advice on special problems. "Dr. Ho and the Eye Clinic staff, have also made regular clinical ophthalmic examinations of selected children and Mrs. Suckling has given a very ready and efficient service in the supply and repair of spectacles. The willing help of all at the Eye Clinic has been much appreciated. "Dr. Werren medically examined all children at the school during the months of May and June. In January and September, Mr. Taylor carried out full School Dental Inspections of all children on roll and subsequent treatment was accepted by almost all the children referred. Miss Rasor of the Wingfield House Speech Therapy Clinic visited the school and five children received Speech Therapy during the year. "Visitors to the school during the year included Dr. Scott Stevenson from the Ministry of Education, Miss Deavin and Mr. Lumsden, Her Majesty's Inspectors, Student District Nurses, Student Health Visitors, Training College Students, Students from Dr. Barnardo s Staff Training College, Home Teachers for the Blind, Head Teachers and qualified teachers. 14 "In February a presentation ceremony was held at the school when, on behalf of the East Ham Rotary Club £200's worth of large print books were presented by Mr. W. Williams, M.P. " In April the Annual General Meeting of the Association for the Education and Welfare of the Partially Sighted was held at the school. "In August, Mrs. H. McCarthy, Welfare Assistant, retired after eleven years service, her place being taken in September by Mrs. Whellams. "The school participated in the London Partially Sighted Schools' Sports at North House, Wimbledon and in the Walthamstow Special Schools Sports. " In September an extra classroom became available upon the closure of the William Morris Technical School annexe. "Fifteen children have regularly attended the South West Essex Technical college baths for swimming instruction. Four certificates were gained during the year. "The average number on roll during the year was 46.3 with an average attendance of 40.6. During the year ten children were admitted and ten were taken off roll as follows:- 1 transferred to L.C.C. Partially Sighted School 1 transferred to Partially Sighted Grammar School (Residential) 3 transferred to normal schools 1 transferred to Training Centre 3 to employment (2 boys - one as shop assistant and one in printing trade, 1 girl - as hairdresser) 1 girl left to take course of Secretarial Training. "I have to express thanks to all my colleagues, teaching, welfare and transport for their continuing efforts on behalf of the children" . WINGFIELD HOUSE SCHOOL FOR THE PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED. Mr. G.M. Williams, Headmaster, reports as follows:- "The school commenced on the 8th January 1963 with 88 children on roll, drawn from the following areas: Walthamstow Leyton Chingford Loughton Wanstead and Woodford Chigwell Harlow Waltham Abbey Epping Enfield North Weald "During the year there were 15 admissions, giving an average weekly roll of 83.9 and an average attendance of 63.6 15 There were 19 children taken off roll, as follows:- Transferred to other schools 10 to ordinary day school 1 to E.S.N. School 1 to Residential Special School 1 to Cerebral Plasy Unit 1 Deceased, To employment 1 boy to jigsaw factory 1 boy to clerical work 1 boy to furniture factory 1 girl to Sheltered Workshop 1 girl to Training Centre Two of the leavers were registered as disabled persons. " The average length of stay of the children transferred to other schools was 2 years 8 months, and those leaving for employment 4 years 11 months. Of the children on roll 58 received treatment by Miss H. Garrett in the Orthopaedic Clinic, and 18 children received Speech Therapy by Miss J. Rasor. There were 4 non ambulent children on roll and 6 who were only partially ambulent. " Visitors to the school during the year included parties of pupil midwives from Thorpe Coombe Training Unit, Student Health Visitors, post graduate medical students and students from several Teacher Training Colleges. ' The school has benefitted greatly, by the valued co-operation of Miss Garratt, the Orthopaedic Clinic, and of Miss Rasor in the Speech Clinic. Miss Smith has made visits for the purpose of educational guidance, and the Youth Employment Officer and his staff have interviewed and advised all school leavers. "Dr. Poole who is in clinical charge of the school, has made regular weekly visits, and Dr. Werren has made 7 visits for the purpose of supplementary inspection. Their ready and helpful advice has been greatly appreciated. "Mrs. Leach, S.R.N., has attended the school daily and has assisted in the general care and management of the children, and has also carried out audiometric testing on selected children. A total of 202 minor treatments have been carried out. "The children on roll at the end of the school year were classified as follows:- Delicate 14 Epileptic 2 Maladjusted 4 Physically Handicapped 61 I would record my thanks to all staff colleagues for their continued and steadfast service on behalf of the school" . 16 SPECIALIST CLINICS CHILD GUIDANCE CLINIC. The continuing improvement in the physical health of children permits the School Doctors to devote more time to treating and seeking to prevent behavioural and emotional disorders. Dr. Gillespie, Director of the Child Guidance Clinic, writes:- " There has been a slight increase in the number of children referred in the Forest and Chingford areas, but fewer were referred from the Walthamstow area. A substantial increase has also been noted in the number of children under five, referred during the year from all areas. This again is a source of great satisfaction to me as I am convinced of the need to deal with emotional disturbances in young children at an early stage. The waiting list has greatly diminished as compared with last year's figures, and follows on more children being seen in diagnostic consultation. Our hopes of providing an improved service for the Walthamstow, Chingford and Forest divisions have been fulfilled as we no longer have to deal with children from the Leyton area. Miss E. M. Goldberg of the National Institute for Social Work Training, who was engaged on a study of case work, consulted our clinic as a source of material for her survey. Miss Laquer was given the opportunity by the local authority to attend a refresher course on "Psychiatric Social Work: Developments in Training and Practice",. which she found very profitable and stimulating. In conclusion, I would like to make a strong plea for tire establishment of an extended nursery school service in our areas, especially in the Forest division which has so far not been able to have one. Nursery schools provide an important adjunct in the promotion of mental health in children and their young mothers" . Shortage of specialist staff does hamper the work of prevention and treatment, thus, of the ten play therapy sessions authorised it has been possible to staff only two. and other commitments have prevented health visitors from taking full advantage of opportunities to attend case conferences and similar meetings as a means of extending their understanding of psychiatric problems. Full liaison is maintained, however, between the workers in individual cases as for example the probation officers. 17 Miss E.M. Smith, the Educational Psychologist, has given a number of talks to groups concerned with psychological and educational development of children and considers that closer links should be established between the parents of young children and their teachers. Commenting on the new methods of education she writes "Security is accepted as one of the basic needs of children, who quickly demonstrate its lack by regressing in behaviour to the point in their development at which they knew maximum security. Starting school is often unsettling for a five-year-old, with consequent recurrence of bed-wetting, thumb-sucking and the like, symptoms which disappear as the child adjusts to the wider environment. In the reception class most children seem happy and parents accept the play regime. With the introduction of more formal learning anxiety may show itself again in both children and parents. The child may find the discipline of book learning difficult, while parents begin to look for results, because the child is no longer a baby, and. work is important. Unfortunately, most parents lack information or understanding of normal learning processes and current standards of attainment. Their yardstick of attainment is generally their very fallible adult memory of their own school experience, with Education given the narrow connotation of the three R s. They naturally want to help their children, or test their progress, but in trying to do so they create a situation fraught with emotion and anxiety. It is baffling to find that the child, who at the age of four could recognise A(aye), B(bee), C(see) etc. cannot now cope with Janet and John, or that another who was counting to 100 at home, cannot settle to a page of easy sums set by father. "We don't do this kind at school," he says. The child finds that parents are no longer trusty sources of support, and begins to manipulate a divided world. Parents, still wanting ultimate success for their child, begin to feel inad equate, and to rationalise their failure in aggressive criticism of school. This attitude of mind is often caught by the child. Here could be one. of the causes of school failure and truancy. 18 These changes in school methods were the results of an educational revolution some thirty years ago. Psychological research showed that in learning to read, words were recognised by the letter-shape of the whole word, by association with pictures, or by the sounds of the letters. A child could not logically recite Jay..ay.. en..e..tee and arrive at Janet. The new method gradually was adopted in schools, but parents were left ignorant of the change. Before they have really grasped the current methods, a new revolution is upon them. Further educational research under the stimulus of necessity, surnamed expediency, has produced a new reading method which should speed up the intial processes, and a new approach to mathematics which prepare children for the technical know how needed in the computer age. Soon parents will find that first reading books have an augmented alphabet no longer twentysix letters, but with extra strange letter like symbols. Books they buy for their children will not have the same printed look as school books. Sum books as used in school will seem to be dealing in fields formerly considered as geometry and algebra. These new methods seem to be soundly based. But parents may find an even wider gap between their educational language and that which the child will meet in school. So parents are likely to be more anxious, more insecure, where their children's primary education is concerned. Surely this prospect calls for preventive action on the part of all who are responsible for or interested in the stable development of children within a secure family environment. Should not the parents and all relevant adults, outside the scholastic world, be given some insight into the changing educational methods, so they can to some extent share and comprehend the learning experiences of their children? If we still hold that the family is the best social unit in which a child should grow up, it should be the aim of research, administration, and education as well as medicine to preserve it on as many levels as possible, and not to drive the educational wedge even deeper between parents and children. To maintain or restore family security, one step should surely be to explain new (and not so new) teaching methods to parents. How?" 19 EAR. NOSE AND THROAT CLINIC. The weekly Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic has continued under the clinical charge of Dr. A. Cammock, M.B., B Ch., D.L.O. EYE CLINIC. The Clinic continues under the clinical charge of Dr. Hilton Ho. The services of a dispensing optician and an orthopist are available to patients. ORTHOPAEDIC CLINIC. Mr. K. Dalliwall, Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon in charge of the Clinic reports that the work of the clinic has continued on much the same lines as in the past, the bulk of the work being concerned with providing physiotherapy services for schoolchildren in an environment which is more suitable for them than that of a general hospital. PAEDIATRIC CLINIC. The clinic continued under the clinical care of Dr. Elchon Hinden, Paediatrician to Whipps Cross Hospital, who reports as follows; " In spring and early summer, 1962, there was an epidemic of german measles (rubella) in the towns lying to the east of the County of London, of which Walthamstow is one. Among the victims were several women recently pregnant I don't know how many. Towards the end of that year and in January 1963 at least five affected babies were born, two or three of them in our local maternity hospital, the others in a neighbouring borough. I have seen these five myself; there may well be others who have been seen by other paediatricians. As a rule, maternal disease does not affect the unborn child. The womb is not easily penetrated by infection, and the placenta which joins the child to his mother is a strong shield to ward off harmful influences. So pneumonia and tonsillitis and appendicitis do not disturb the foetus in his still, dark sea. But the virus infections do pierce his defences. The fierce ones, like smallpox and influenza, slay him; he dies and is cast out as a miscarriage. But the mild ones, and especially german measles, do not kill they merely maim. Three organs in particular are disorganised the ear, the eye, and the heart. So the children are born deaf, or blind, or with congenital heart disease, or with all three. Of the five children I have personally examined, four are blind (three in both eyes); two are deaf certainly, a third child probably so; two suffer from severe heart disease; and at least two are mentally retarded. 20 Now this is a crying scandal! The evil effects of rubella in early pregnancy have been known since soon after the last war - fifteen years at least. The number of babies ravaged probably far exceeds the number damaged by thalidomide, yet there is no public outcry and no steps taken to halt these calamities. Prevention is obvious and easy. We must do everything possible to ensure that all children, and especially girls, contract this mild illness before they leave school. Par from isolating and quarantining rubella, the sufferer from it should be positively welcomed to school with a fanfare of trumpets. Parents should be encouraged to expose their children to infection a revival of the "measles tea party" of the last century. Our virologists should be urged to find ways of spreading the disease - not of containing it. If only a way of preserving the virus could be found, as we do with vaccinia lymph, every girl leaving school who had not contracted the disease could be offered it, and with it protection against the disease later on. Usually rubella is less of a nuisance than is vaccination. It should be stressed again and again, that both varieties of measles - ordinary and rubella - are highly infectious, so that with very few exceptions everybody in our urban civilisation catches them. Isolation and quarantine do not safeguard anybody from catching these diseases; they simply ensure that they are caught later, when they are more unpleasant and - in the case of german measles can wreak havoc with a precious new life. These measures do no good; they only harm. I know that it goes against the whole tradition of public health to spread disease; yet with rubella, both doctors and the general public must learn that this is the right thing to do." DENTAL CLINIC Mr. G.P.L. Taylor submits the following report on the work of the School Dental Service: "Our hopes for the recruitment of more full-time dental officers were not fulfilled, but the part-time surgeons continued to give valuable assistance in the department. This enabled us to inspect and offer treatment to a slightly larger number of children than in 1962. However, there has been a lessened response to the treatment offered after school inspections. In quite a number of cases the offer is ignored. I hope, in the coming year, that this can be overcome by some dental health propaganda. 21 We shall be welcoming in the new year, the services of a young lady, trained at the School of Dental Auxiliaries which has been established by the General Dental Council. Part of her duties will include instruction in dental health and hygiene. I might add that the employment in future of more of these auxiliaries may go a long way to solving the staffing problem. In conclusion, I am pleased to say that the increase in the number of fillings done is matched by a reduction in the number of extractions." HEALTH EDUCATION Miss C. Oldham, Superintendent Health Visitor, reports as follows: " Health Education in the Senior Girls' Schools continues to be much appreciated. The subject matter varies widely, being dependent upon the aptitude and ability of the pupils, and to coincide with area requirements. Programmes are arranged to cover simple first aid, physical health and development, mothercraft and parentcraft. Visits of observation are arranged to illustrate some of the local health and welfare services available. The Health Visitors who carry out Health Education in Schools report it is often surprising and enlightening to note the wide variety of questions which arise during discussion following these sessions." During the first three weeks in July, when the G.C.E. Examinations were almost over, health talks given by Dr. J. Werren to the fifth and some sixth forms at both Walthamstow and Woodford High Schools for Girls, at the invitation of the head mistresses concerned. First of all a lecture, illustrated with slides, was given on " Smoking and Health" , and this was followed by questions and discussion. Subsequently the girls were invited to send in questions anonymously about any aspects of growing up which puzzled them and which they would like answered and discussed. Attendance was voluntary and the parents of the girls were informed that the discussions would take place. The girls divided into groups of 2 0 to 30 for these dis cussions, which each lasted one and a half to two hours and which provided a great deal of interest. 22 The questions were spread over a wide range of subjects including emotional relationships with boys, contraception, veneral disease and abortions, as well as other questions relating to anatomy, physiology and hygiene. These discussion groups, which were started in Walthamstow in 1962 and at Woodford the following year, have widened in scope and certainly seem to fulfil a need. As yet there are no similar groups for grammar school boys. 23 STATISTICAL SUMMARY SCHOOL POPULATION No. of schools No. on roll (20 12.63) Secondary 17 7815 Junior 17 4630 Infant 20 2877 Special 4 272 Nursery 1 82 PERCENTAGE ATTENDANCE Jan.
