To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Barnes. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report on the health of the Borough during the year 1946. Although this report is presented by me, the Medical Officer of Health during the period under review was in fact Dr. W. F. Twining McMath. As this report is the only one for whose presentation I shall be responsible and as far-reaching changes will occur in the near future, it may be appropriate to refer briefly to the past and to existing unsolved problems. THE PAST. As we glance through some 50 years of reports we find we have now pure water, improved conditions of sale of food, better standards of child care, better housing, all the concern of the Public Health Department. From its early concern with " smells, drains and fevers," the public health service has expanded to interest in every aspect of health, and to the provision of facilities unknown to the pioneers—ante-natal clinics, child welfare clinics, immunisation, a special section for housing, the provision of food supplements, day nurseries, home helps and the associated medical care of the school child. In 1897, the death rate under 1 year per 1,000 live births was 145'9; in 1898 it was 182.3 ; in 1946 the rate was 36. In the report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1902 we find mention of cesspools " still in use," milk kept by the sellers " in the scullery or fowl house " and " the cans washed in the family wash tub " ; some houses " still supplied by wells." He forecasts that " typhoid fever is certain to become more frequent as the district becomes more urban." The conditions to which he refers no longer exist, and typhoid fever is now a rarity, The vital statistics, improved living conditions, lowered incidence of most infectious diseases, are objective indications of what has been accomplished. THE PRESENT. Infant Mortality. Mortality among infants under one year of age has been so much reduced that the main problem now remaining is death and disability due to congenital defects, the importance of which is seen in Table V. Research into this aspect of infantile 4 mortality is being intensified in the new departments of child health of the nation's medical schools. Housing. This is a terrifying problem. The social effects of families crowded together are only too clear. As to health, every public health officer is aware of the fact, for example, that children are obliged to sleep even in the same room as cases of open tuberculosis, that in not a few cases of maladjustment in children the housing conditions are primarily responsible. Our lists of cases urgently requiring rehousing on medical grounds grows and it is clear that this is a formidable danger to the health of the citizen and to the stability of the family. Hospital Accommodation. The position in this matter approaches breakdown. Large numbers of old people who require institutional care and/or treatment, in their own interests and that of others, have no reasonable expectation of securing it; cases of tuberculosis wait long periods for beds, sometimes to their own detriment, very often to the danger of their relatives, especially children ; maternity cases are accommodated with difficulty, the demand among mothers for hospital delivery, reinforced by housing difficulties, grow ever more acute. These problems are national not local, but are severely felt in Barnes. Public health departments to-day in urban areas are faced not with defective drains, poor water supplies, as were their predecessors, but with housing and bed shortage. Improved nutrition, health centres, prophylaxis, all these are very good and necessary, but public health authorities are forced to realise that these measures alone cannot effectively prevent ill health and disability in those persons who are badly housed and/or unable to secure hospital accommodation when necessary. May I take this opportunity of thanking the authority for the confidence placed in me by appointing me their Medical Officer of Health and my thanks for the kindly relationship which has existed between the authority and myself, and may I also be permitted to express as an official my appreciation of the keen interest of the Council and individual members in all matters affecting the public health. Tribute must also be paid to the staff of the department for their good work, the more notable under the present " bad housing conditions " in which the department itself is still accommodated. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, July, 1947. R. C. WEBSTER, Medical Officer of Health. 5 BOROUGH OF BARNES. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1946. PREFACE. In accordance with Ministry of Health Circular 13/47 the Annual Report for 1946 has been prepared on the same lines as previous years and consists of two parts, a preface in which reference is made to items of special interest and an appendix in which is tabulated the statistics relating to the health of the district. OFFICES. Pending the completion of the erection of the temporary municipal offices in Sheen Lane, where all the departments will, for the first time since 1928, be housed together, the public health department has remained divided into two parts, the general public health and maternity and child welfare sections being located at 117 Mortlake High Street and the sanitary inspectors' and housing portions at the Council House, Mortlake High Street. This division is of course unsatisfactory from an administrative point of view and the reunion of the sections of the department will be a great advantage. STAFF. Dr. W. F. Twining McMath resigned his appointment as Medical Officer of Health upon obtaining an appointment with another authority. He left the services of the Barnes Borough Council on the 11th October, 1946, but continued in a consultant capacity as Acting Medical Officer of Health from the 12th October until 29th December. I commenced duties as Medical Officer of Health on the 30th December. Dr. Rosetta Hill was appointed Assistant Medical Officer and commenced duties on the 23rd September. As a result of the adoption by the Council of the Scheme of Conditions of Service of the National Joint Council for Local Authorities' Administrative, Professional, Technical and Clerical Services, the establishment of the department consequently decided upon created vacancies for a Deputy Chief Sanitary Inspector and an Assistant Housing Manager. On the 13th March, Mr. W. L. Leach, one of the Additional Sanitary Inspectors was promoted to the first position, and Mr. A. A. Brown, another Additional Sanitary Inspector, newly returned from service with H.M. Forces, appointed to the second. The vacancy for an additional sanitary inspector caused by Mr. Brown's appointment was filled by Mr. P. J. Shannon, who commenced duties with this authority on the 13th September. 6 Another result of the New Scheme of Conditions was the transfer of Miss L. M. Fairclough and Miss K. P. Morcom from the temporary to the permanent staff. Consequent upon the reorganisation of areas resulting from the Education Act, 1944, when a scheme for the establishment of a Divisional Executive Committee for the Boroughs of Barnes and Richmond was adopted, it was agreed that the Medical Officers of Health of the respective Boroughs should be appointed Divisional Medical Officers for the purposes of the School Medical Services and that an additional clerk be appointed in the Public Health Department of the Borough of Barnes to carry out clerical work in connection with that service. Miss M. E. Wright was appointed to the vacancy thus available and commenced duties on the 12th August. During the year Mrs. M. Gazzard, a part-time shorthand typist, resigned and ceased duties on the 5th January, being replaced by Mrs. R. Alsford, who started duties on the 21st February. Two temporary juniors, Mr. D. Massam and Miss J. Dupille, also commenced duties during the year, on the 15th April and 24th February respectively. The vacant appointment of Matron at the Borough Infectious Diseases Hospital on the permanent staff was filled by Miss M. McPhee who commenced duties in that capacity on the 20th March. Mrs. C. Dyer, who had been kindly acting as Temporary Matron pending the appointment of a Matron on the permanent staff, completed her term of office on the 21st April. Miss M. Farrer, who had been appointed Matron of the Castelnau Day Nursery resigned and left on the 31st December, 1945. She was succeeded on the 25th February, 1946, by Miss D. L. Rhodes. SANITARY INSPECTION OF DISTRICT. The work of the sanitary inspectors has been considerably increased by the present shortage of labour and material. Defective conditions which before the war would have been remedied within a short time of the service of an informal notice now tend to remain unattended to for a very much longer period owing to the difficulties of the builders. As a result it is necessary for the inspectorial staff to visit the premises many more times. A necessary but uneconomical use of their time and energies. Events still bring to light serious damage to premises due to wartime bombing and gunfire. To really ascertain present-day conditions of property generally would entail a full and careful survey of the borough. Even were staff available for such a survey it would be of little avail for, with the present limited labour and material, and the urgent need to press on with the rebuilding of demolished houses 7 and the building of new ones, little could be done to remedy the defects so discovered. WATER SUPPLY. The water supply of the area has been satisfactory both in quality and in quantity. Four samples of water were collected and submited for bacteriological examination. In each case the results showed that the water was fit for public supply. There has been no evidence of either plumbo-solvency or of any form of contamination. The whole of the dwellings in the Borough are supplied from public water mains direct to house. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Particulars of the incidence and distribution of the cases of infectious disease notified during the year 1946 are set out in Tables 23-26 in the Appendix, in which the number of cases removed to hospital and the number of deaths in the district from these diseases are also given. The incidence of infectious diseases in the Borough during the year have been low, with the exception of dysentery sonne of which there was an outbreak during the year. On March 29th the Head Mistress of a Primary School in the Borough reported that a considerable number of scholars, chiefly of the five to eight year old group, had been away owing to illness commencing about March 27th. Upon investigation, it was ascertained that the condition from which they had been suffering was dysentery sonne. Sustained enquiries failed to reveal any carrier among the canteen workers of the school or among those serving school meals. Water and milk supplies were examined also, and were found to be in every way pure. Although this was a sudden outbreak at the school, sporadic cases were known to have occurred in the Borough and, in fact, throughout the whole country during the last few years. In all, 83 cases were reported, 68 of which were notified, two of whom were adults ; 14 children were admitted to the Borough Infectious Diseases Hospital. Three other cases occurred during the year but these had no connection with the outbreak among the children and adults connected with the school. In outbreaks of this character, one of the most important means of prevention of spread of infection is special attention to personal cleanliness—such as washing one's hands after using the water-closet and also before taking meals, and the importance of these simple preventive measures were publicised, as far as possible, by personal propaganda and reference thereto in the local presa 8 DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION. The routine propaganda to encourage parents to have their children immunised against diphtheria continued throughout the year. The Minister of Health in his Circular 194 of November, 1945, required welfare authorities to make each health visitor responsible for securing immunisation of children under school age in their own districts. This practice had been in force in the Borough of Barnes since the inauguration of the scheme for immunisation against diphtheria in 1935 and consequently no alteration in existing arrangements were necessary. In order, however, to assist the health visitors to fulfil the instruction to the highest degree of practicability sheets upon which the names of all births notified or received as inward transfers during each month are recorded and handed to the respective health visitors when the children named thereon have reached the age of eleven months. During the eleventh month the health visitor makes a special effort to obtain consent of the parents for immunisation of the children, recording the result of their visits and revisiting for further persuasion where consent is not obtained. In addition the health visitors routinely press parents to agree to immunisation whenever they come across an un-immunised child, whatever its age, during the course of visiting for any of the many purposes which occasion a home visit. The Borough Immunisation clinic is held every Wednesday morning and children of all ages may, and do, attend. There is little or no delay between the receipt of an application for immunisation and the invitation to attend. The cards in use at the Borough Clinics conform to the type recommended by the Ministry and no alteration had been necessary— details of injections of children leaving the district, etc. are forwarded, to the Medical Officers of Health of the areas in which the new addresses are situated. The number of children receiving complete courses of immunising injections during 1946 was 493 as compared with 609 during the previous year. Two children who had been immunised against diphtheria contracted the disease during the year. The first, a child aged 4 years and 8 months had received immunising injections of 0.2 c.c. and 0.5 c.c. A.P.T., in September and October, 1942, and a Schick Test in March, 1944 gave a negative result. The illness was a very mild one. The other was a child aged 6 years, immunised in April and May, 1941 with injections of 0.1 c.c. and 0.3 c.c. A.P.T.—the then accepted dosage. In this case the parents failed to bring the child for a Schick Test. The illness was moderately severe in this instance with paralytic complications. Both children recovered. 9 PROTECTION AGAINST WHOOPING COUGH. The Council's scheme for the free inoculation of children against whooping cough continues in operation. The number of children attending the Council's clinic for protection against whooping cough during 1946 was practically the same as in the previous year. The antigen used is alum precipitated whooping cough vaccine which requires only two injections and which can be given at the same time, if necessary, as the diphtheria prophylactic used. TYPHUS SCHEME. During the year intimation was received from the Ministry of Health that it was no longer considered necessary to make special provision for the treatment of typhus fever. The use of the premises in Mullin's Path taken over from the disbanded Civil Defence Services as an emergency cleansing station for disinfestation of typhus fever contacts was consequently relinquished. HOME HELPS SERVICE. The scheme for home or domestic helps is operated by the clerical staff of the Public Health Department, under supervision of the Medical Officer of Health and with the assistance of the Health visitors. Upon receipt of an application for home help at a home confinement the attendance is provisionally booked, assessment of charges made and applicant advised of the cost. When the applicant has signified acceptance, the midwife, or doctor, is given a note of the name and address of the home help so that she may be called immediately the necessity arises. One month before the anticipated date of confinement the health visitor for the area calls and fixes the hours of attendance of the home help throughout the two weeks she is to attend. In cases where requests for assistance are required for reasons other than confinement at home, applications have to be accompanied by a medical certificate and attendance of a home or domestic help is normally automatic, provided the reason is sufficiently urgent and comes within the scope of the scheme. If no help is available the whole of the cases being attended are reviewed, assessment of the urgency and priority of each case is made and attendance adjusted in order to include the new case. In nearly every instance it has been possible to provide some help. Each home help works a 47-hour week, 8 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. Mondays to Fridays, Saturdays 8 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. Although these are the routine hours, exception is made wherever a definite necessity arises to work other days and hours. Few instances have occurred where 10 this has been necessary. Home Helps for confinement at home are not provided unless,there is someone able to be with the mother after the home help has left each day—if this is not available other provision for the confinement being recommended, and made where necessary. In domestic help cases it is usual to send help for units of two hours, as nearly as possible as often as requested. When the number of cases requiring such help is large, the amount of time available to each case is rationed, so that all cases get some help so far as practicable and subject to priority of urgency and necessity. From inception it has been the practice to treat the theoretically separate Home Help and Domestic Help services as one—utilising the Home Helps for domestic work when not engaged on confinement cases and the Domestic Helps for confinement cases in emergencies. For record purposes details of the different types of cases are kept separately. The six occasions during 1946 when it was necessary to refuse to supply Home Helps, resulted from expected dates of confinements occurring at periods when there was more than a normal number of confinements, and the Home Helps had already been booked for other cases. Such occasions are bound to occur in any scheme owing to the uncertainty of dates of confinements, and the fact that confinements are not evenly distributed throughout any year, but bound to be larger at certain periods, varying from year to year. The Council has been fortunate in the home and domestic helps employed and in only one case has there been made a complaint by a recipient of the service. In this case the complaints were nebulous, and upon investigation appeared to be without foundation. Many appreciative letters or verbal thanks for the given assistance have been received throughout the period of the scheme. In the case of domestic helps it is noticeable that most applicants are families who had been used to domestic help in the home before the war—the poorer families in the district who have had to make do without domestic help through financial difficulties throughout their lives and for whom, no doubt, such a provision would be highly desirable, usually do not apply for help, and in any case the method of assessment of contributions towards the cost of the service almost invariably makes it necessary to request payment at the full rate, i.e., at 2/- an hour which results in financial difficulty to many families of moderate means. In July, 1946, as a result of Ministry of Health Circular 110/46, the Domestic Help and Home Help services were amalgamated under the title " Home Helps Service." The number of home helps 11 employed has increased steadily from one whole time worker in October 1943 to 4 whole-time and 1 part-time on the 31st December, 1946 In February, 1947 the number of workers had further increased to 7 whole-time and 3 part-time. CLEANSING STATION. The Barnes Cleansing Station continued to serve a necessary purpose throughout the year. There has been no alteration in the arrangements to combat infestation which were enumerated in detail in the Annual Report for 1944. In no case during the year was it found necessary to take statutory action. BOROUGH ACCIDENT AND GENERAL PURPOSES AMBULANCE SERVICE. Details of the number of journeys made and the types of cases dealt with by the Borough Ambulances are given in Table 19. HOSPITAL CAR SERVICE. There is a County Voluntary Hospital Car Service of which use is made by all hospitals, with one exception, normally attended by residents of the Borough. This car service is available, via the hospitals concerned, for the conveyance of sitting case patients attending hospitals and clinics who need special transport and are unable to hire or pay for the hire of cars. Application for use of such a vehicle is arranged by the hospital concerned, which with its knowledge of the condition of the patient is best able to assess the need for the use of the service. In addition the Barnes Borough Council have made arrangements with two car owners, who have kindly volunteered to undertake such work on a nominal payment by the Council and the provision of petrol for the specific journeys, to supplement the County Service where this is not available. For stretcher cases the Borough Ambulance is of course available at a small charge, or free in necessitous cases. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE. In August it was necessary to increase the number of Ante-natal Clinics in the Borough still more by arranging sessions on the two Saturday mornings not already used for the purpose. There are now 8 sessions held each month, 4 in each area. There have been no alterations made in 1946 in the arrangements 12 for the care of premature infants and the care of illegitimate children detailed in the Annual Report for 1945. As a result of the joint circulars, Ministry of Health No. 221/45 and Ministry of Education No. 75, the question of day nursery provision in the Borough was reviewed during the year. The Council decided to continue a service similar in all respects to that maintained during the war, there being in their opinion a definite need for the provision. Arrangements were made therefore, to take over the two war-time day nurseries previously maintained by the Ministry of Health. In addition the question of daily guardians, sitters-in and creches were investigated. Deciding that the question of creches should be deferred for some future consideration the Council resolved to put into effect schemes for " daily guardians " and "sitters-in." Despite advertisement and personal canvassing the response to requests for registration as " daily guardians " was poor and no women willing to undertake such work have intimated willingness to do so. A number of suitable women, however, have registered as "sitters-in," but the service is little used.

Overcrowding. The position with regard to overcrowding cannot be accurately assessed without a general survey of housing conditions in the area. The system of allocation of corporation houses and flats gives some preference to overcrowded cases and during the year 8 statutorily overcrowded families, involving 32 persons, were rehoused in Council owned properties. 22 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA.

The discrepancies were of a minor character and the informal action taken resulted in satisfactory measures being taken to comply with the required standards. The Public Analyst reports that, in classifying the samples as genuine or otherwise, all relevant Regulations and Orders under the Defence Regulations, as well as the Regulations made under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, have been taken into account. Several of the discrepancies found related to labelling of articles required by recent legislation. 25 Heat Treatment (Prescribed Tests) Order, 1944. Four samples of Pasteurised Milk were submitted for examination under the provisions of the above Order. All the samples were found to have been efficiently pasteurised and to satisfy the prescribed standards. Ice Cream. Three samples of ice cream, taken from two manufacturers, were submitted for bacteriological and chemical examination. Bacillus coli was found to be present in l/100th c.c. in all three samples. There, is however, no prescribed standard of cleanliness or quality for ice cream. The results were regarded as fairly satisfactory but the vendors were requested to improve their standards of cleanliness, and in one case further sterilizing apparatus was installed.
