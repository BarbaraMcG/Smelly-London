LONDON: The Avenue Press, Ltd. Stratford, E., and 6 and 8, Bouvbrib Street, E.C. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, TOWN HALL, WEST HAM. To the Council of the County Bonough of West Ham. Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, " Every Medical Officer of Health appointed under order of the Local Government Board is required to make an annual report with regard to the sanitary district which is under his superintendence . . . . . The report is to be for the year ending 31st December. It should be chiefly concerned with the conditions affecting health in the district, and with the means for improving those conditions. It should contain an account of the sanitary circumstances of the district, and of any improvement or deterioration which may have occurred during the year in those circumstances." In accordance with the above requisition, I beg to submit my annual report for the year 1906, and in doing so, desire to point out that such report must necessarily consist very largely of a summary of my periodical reports and other matters which have been under discussion by the Council during the year, and which therefore are more or less within the immediate recollection of the members. The collated returns, however, and the statement of local circumstances, which may appear superfluous to members fully conversant with them, serve not only as valuable statistical records for future reference, but are needed by the Local Government Board and other authorities, to whom the Medical Officer of Health is required to forward copies. I am, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, CHARLES SANDERS, Medical Officer of Health. a 2 4 METEOROLOGY. The observations given below are extracted from the weekly reports of observations taken at Greenwich Observatory, a course justified by the geographical position of the Borough immediately to the North of Greenwich. They show that the registered sunshine of the year was 1,733 1 hours, being 311.6 hours more than in 1905. The hottest day was August 31st, when the temperature reached 94.3 degrees, and the coldest day was December 26th, when it sank to 22.3 degrees. The number of rainy days was 162, the total rainfall of the year being 24.50 inches. The greatest daily fall occurred on June 29th, when 1.9 inches fell. Meteorology during 1906.

Area.—The area of the County Borough of West Ham is 4,706 acres. Latitude 51° 30'—51° 33'N. Longitude 0° l'W.— 0° 3; E. Altitude, 1 foot to 46 feet above Ordnance datum. Population.—The population of the Borough at the Census in 1901 was 267,358. The number of inhabited houses 41,433, giving 6.4 persons to each house. The estimated population at the middle of 1906 was 301,617. At the Census in 1901 the number of persons per acre was 56.8. Below is given the area of the wards of the Borough (excluding water) and the population per acre in each ward at Census year:— Ward. Area in Acres. Persons per Acre.

The birth.rate for the year was 30.4 per 1,000, while the average birth.rate during the 7 ten years 1896.1905 was 33.5 per 1,000. Distributed to the various wards of the Borough the births were as follows:— Ward. Males. Females. Total. Rate per 1,000 population.

One year and upwards. Plaistow Hospital 6 104 West Ham Hospital 4 61 St. Mary's Hospital 22 44 Seamen's Hospital — 51 Plaistow Maternity Nursing Home 17 2 Medical Mission Hospital 1 16 Non.residents registered in the district 12 108 8 The 3,711 deaths registered do not include the undermentioned deaths in public institutions:— Under 1 year. One year and upwards. Union Infirmary 57 543 Borough Asylum — 104 Dagenham Hospital — — Residents registered in London Institutions. 53 262 After the suitable adjustments rendered necessary by the foregoing tables have been made, the net deaths of the Borough numbered 4,610 (2,427 males and 2,183 females), being 36 more than the previous year and 131 below the average for the past ten years. This makes an annual death.rate of 15.2 per 1,000, or 2.6 below the average death.rate during the ten years 1896.1905, which was 17.8 per 1,000. Corrected for age and sex distribution this death.rate becomes 16.2 per 1,000, the factor for correction being 1.0693. In the following table the foregoing deaths are distributed to the various wards of the Borough and the death.rates of the wards calculated from the estimated population at the middle of the year. In obtaining these estimates regard has been laid, firstly, to the natural increase of population (births over deaths) which in aggre gate amounted to 4,583, and secondly, to the number of houses finally passed by the Borough Engineer for occupation during the year 1906. 9 The number of houses finally passed by the Borough Engineer were as follows:— New Town 2 West Ham 13 Forest Gate 4 Plaistow 165 High Street 1 Hudsons 65 Broadway 30 Canning Town 72 Park 1 Tidal Basin 69 Upton 4 Custom House 3 WARD MORTALITY STATISTICS.

In the following tables I append particulars, so far as possible, relating to each disease separately—both notifiable and non.notifiable epidemic diseases. In the latter cases, however, the returns of cases being obtained from the School Attendance Officers are necessarily inexact. Notifiable Epidemic Diseases. Disease. Notified Cases. Deaths.

It is a disorder very difficult to combat in the way of prevention, owing to the infectious condition of the sufferer in the early stage of the disease, when he appears to be merely attacked with catarrh. One is naturally loth to interfere with educational continuity, but, in view of the fact that very frequently the disease itself, by becoming rapidly epidemic, produces this result, it is becoming evident to Health Authorities that early closure may be advisable, especially in the case of Infants' Departments. With this object the Infants' Departments of both the Star Lane and West Silvertown Council Schools were closed for a period of three weeks (17 school days), the former in February and the latter in October. Smallpox.—No case of Smallpox was notified during the year, and so far as one can judge the Borough was entirely free from this disease. The Dagenham Smallpox Hospital was, in consequence, not put into active use. At the end of 1905, however, the agreements entered into between your Council and the eight other adjoining Sanitary Authorities, by which the cases of Smallpox occurring in the districts of the latter Authorities obtained admission to the Dagenham Hospital, were determined, and your Council found it expedient, in entering upon fresh agreements, to vary the terms originally drafted in order to render them more equitable to the County Borough. A draft of the new form of agreement, which has been agreed to by all the Authorities concerned in the old arrangement, will be found at the end of this report. Scarlatina was more cpidemic last year than during the previous decade, the disease being nearly three times as prevalent in 1906 as compared with 1903, when the smallest number (660) of cases of Scarlatina which have occurred in any year since the passing of the 12 Infectious Disease Notification Clauses in 1888 was recorded. 1,703 cases were reported and 39 deaths occurred, giving an attack rate and death rate of 5.6 and 0.12 respectively. The chief incidence fell upon the Plaistow and Custom House Wards, these two districts being responsible for nearly one.third of the cases. Roughly speaking, an average of about 125 cases occurred each month during the year, except during October, when 306 cases were notified, a fact most probably associated with the reassembling of the children in school after the August holidays, and the intermingling with the healthy of some mild and unrecognised cases. During the year 830 cases of Scarlatina were removed to hospital, being 48 per cent. of the cases notified. Dr. Scuifield, Medical Officer of Health of Sheffield, has recently collected statistics relating to this disease from the largest English towns, and the information he obtained is embodied in the Table on following page, from which it will be seen that, save in respect of the attack rate for 1906, West Ham compares favourably with the majority of the other towns. 13 Scarlet Fever.—Sickness and Mortality in the twenty largest towns of England Towns.

I propose to give the facts for the whole year first, and deal with the June outbreak subsequently. The total number of notifications received was 373, and the total number of deaths 53, making an attack rate of 1.23 and a death rate of 017 per 1,000 of population respectively, and a case mortality of 14 per cent. The average death rate for the previous ten years was 0.23 per 1,000. 215 males were attacked and 158 females. Their ages varied as shown by the following summary:— Under 5 years 38 cases. Between 5 and 15 years 127 „ „ 15 „ 25 92 „ „ 25 „ 56 „ 116 „ Of the total 373 cases, 126 were admitted to the Plaistow Fever Hospital, 50 were admitted into the Infirmary at Whipp's Cross, and 55 were removed to other hospitals in the district or in London, while 142 were treated at home. A glance at the chart accompanying shows that the notifications of this disease, which had been few during the first five months of the year, suddenly in June assumed huge proportions requiring immediate investigation to ascertain if possible the cause, and to prevent or diminish the epidemic. This was at once undertaken, and a preliminary report made to the Council and to the Local Government Board. A copy of the latter is here appended. 16 Town Hall, West Ham, E. 26th June, 1906. Sir, ENTERIC FEVER. I beg to make a special report to you on an outbreak of Enteric Fever in the County Borough. During the past few months the notifications of Enteric Fever have been less than the average, and during the first fortnight in the month of June numbered only four, viz.:—two in the week ending June 2nd, and two in the week ending June 9th. During the second fortnight in June, however, 52 cases of Enteric Fever were notified, viz:—13 in the week ending June 16th, and 39 in the week ending June 23rd. By far the greater number of these 52 cases occurred within two wards of the Borough, viz:—the Hudson Ward and the Custom House Ward. I enclose herewith a map of the County Borough showing the Hudson Ward marked in blue and the Custom House Ward marked in red, and the approximate position of each of the above 52 cases marked with a red cross. The families attacked belong entirely to the working-class, inhabiting mostly two-storey houses let to two families. The heaviest incidence of disease has occurred in males and in children—32 males and 20 females being attacked. The age incidence is given below:— No. of Ages. cases. Under 1 year 0 Between 1 year and 5 years .. ... 5 ,, 5 ,, 10 „ 5 „ 10 „ 15 „ 17 „ 15 „ 20 „ 9 „ 20 „ 25 „ 5 „ 25 „ 30 „ 5 30 years and upwards 6 52 17 The daily notifications occurred as below:— No. of Date. cases. June 11th 1 „ 12th 2 „ 13th 1 „ 14th 3 „ 15th 3 „ 16th 3 „ 18th 7 „ 19th 7 „ 20th 5 „ 21st 7 „ 22nd 9 „ 23rd 4 Upon investigation, no point in common among any considerable number of the cases has been discovered, except that in 24 out of the 52 cases a definite history of the eating of cockles a short time (varying from a week to a fortnight) prior to the attack was forthcoming, and 13 of these 24 were able to fix the purchase on 26th May—most of them from a particular shop, though some purchases were made in the street. The cockles obtained from the shop in question, on 26th May, were purchased from Billingsgate and were part of a consignment from Leigh-on-Sea. In view of the known liability of pollution at this reach of the Thames and the strong evidence that the eating of infected shellfish was the cause of the greater number of Enteric Fever cases which have recently occurred, I so reported to my Public Health Committee, on June 20th, and with the consent of the Education Authority, on June 21st, I approached by circular letter all the Head Teachers of the Public Elementary Schools, requesting them to warn the parents through the children, of the danger of eating shellfish, especially in-a B 18 partially cooked form and am also publishing posters throughout the Borough to a like effect. I shall report to you again when any additional information is obtained. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, CHARLES SANDERS. The Secretary, Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. The sudden outburst in June and the equally sudden drop at the beginning of July, followed by a secondary crop of cases so characteristic of enteric fever epidemics, naturally suggested that if a common factor was to be found at all, it should be discovered in the 72 June cases. Four of these cases proved not to be suffering from enteric fever, leaving 68 as the total number of primary attacks in the epidemic, of these 68 cases 40 were males and 28 females. Their ages varied as given below:— Under 5 years 5 cases. Between 5 and 15 years 25 „ ,, 15 and 25 „ 19 „ 25 and 56 „ 19 „ The 68 cases occurred in 60 houses, one house contained 3 cases, six houses 2 cases each, and fifty-three houses 1 case each. It will be seen from the accompanying map of the Borough that the houses attacked were limited to two comparatively small areas, that around the middle of Barking Road being much the larger of the two. This localization at once practically excluded any fear of a water-borne epidemic, and directed attention to some other common article of diet. Each house was visited, and each case personally interrogated, whether at home or at hospital, with a view to ascertaining a common foodstuff which might have been affected. The usually long incubation period and insidious onset of this disease renders it an especially difficult 19 task to carry the mind back and re-call the food partaken of manydays previously, but in view of the fact that the early suggestion of cockles being implicated in the outbreak, involved serious hardships on the cockle industry (the careful cockle dealers having to suffer equally with the careless), and having regard to the fact that fried fish had been associated with previous outbreaks in London, every endeavour was made to obtain reliable information both from the persons attacked and from their friends. Fried fish being such a plentiful commodity in the district, it was felt to be highly probable that most of the sufferers would prove to be fried fish eaters, but such was not the result of investigation. In only 33 cases, or 48 per cent., could a positive history be obtained of the patient having had fried fish at or about the period likely to have been the affecting date, and fifteen different shops appeared to be involved in the supply of such fish. The highest number who purchased from any single shop was 5, or 7 per cent. With regard to cockles, however, 37 persons, or 54 per cent., gave a positive history of having taken cockles, of these, 15, or 22 per cent., purchased them at a particular shop, while 23, or 32 per cent., were able to fix the 26th May as the date of purchase either from the shop mentioned or from a stall in the street. In this connection it may be mentioned that a cockle stall was stationed at the lower end of Prince Regent's Lane, on 26th May, and that several of the sufferers in the smaller Custom House area bought from this stall. The trams from here to the Barking Road are, however, frequently used for shopping purposes, especially on Saturday nights, and it is a very suggestive coincidence to find two cases both attacked about the 7th or 8th of June, and living so far apart as Grange Road and the bottom of Prince Regent's Lane, with nothing in common except the one fact that they both went to a particular shop in the Barking Road for cockles on Saturday evening, 26th May. It was also commonly asserted that the patients were the only members of the family who partook of cockles, but where fried fish was eaten B 2 20 at all it was generally consumed by several other persons, and in view of the number of single attacks it is difficult to explain the immunity of all the other members of the family if fried fish were responsible for the single attack. So soon as the possible connection of cockle eating with typhoid infection became apparent, notices were posted in the district warning the public in the following terms:— NOTICE! Owing to a sudden outbreak of Typhoid (Enteric) Fever in the Borough, traced in a large number of cases to the consumption of COCKLES and other shell-fish, the Public is again reminded of the fact that these articles of diet are frequently exposed to grave pollution, and is warned of the serious risk which thereby is run by those who eat them. Public Health Department, C. S. Town Hall, June, 1906. West Ham. The sale of these shellfish was temporarily discontinued, and the subsequent course of the epidemic did not materially differ from that of similar outbreaks, the secondary cases finally dying out at the end of the year. These secondary cases were numerous, but they were chiefly localized in and around the districts implicated in the initial outbreak, and did not spread to the northern division of the Borough. Watercress.—In my Annual Report for 1905 the possible association of Enteric Fever with the eating of watercress was dealt with, and a special memorandum relating to the subject in connection with certain watercress beds at Temple Mills was included. I refer to the subject here in order to record the fact that these suspected beds have been disused for some months, and are now being filled up. 21 Midwives Act, 1902.—The Midwives' roll for 1906 contained the names of 134 Certified Midwives residing in West Ham. Only 49 midwives sent in notice of their intention to practice during the year in accordance with Section 10 of the Act. 385 records of sending for medical aid were received from midwives, and 69 notices of still-birth. In March, 1906, the Central Midwives Board issued a useful synopsis showing particulars of administration of the Midwives Act by Local Supervising Authorities in England and Wales. Of the midwives practising in West Ham, 17 were uncertificated and placed on the roll by virtue of their having been in bona fide practice prior to the passing of the Act. The larger part of the confinements attended by women are treated by the midwives attached to the Plaistow Maternity Charity, and by the courtesy of these and the other practising midwives the following figures have been supplied, showing the number of confinements attended in 1906:— (a) Attended by midwives from Howard's Road 2,178 (b) „ „ ,, LansdowneRoad 1,184 (c) „ other practising midwives 1,289 4,651 Infant Mortality.—The deaths in infants under one year of age numbered 1,368, giving a rate of 148 per 1,000 births, a slight fall as compared with the previous year, when the rate was 156. The infant mortality rate, as in the case of the general death rate, varies considerably in the different Wards of the Borough, as can be seen by the Table given on page 9. In order to combat this grave misfortune it is the practice of the Women Inspectors to visit as many houses as possible where births have occurred and, as explained in previous reports, to enquire into the condition of the premises, the mode of feeding, Ac., and if the latter be found defective to leave printed advice prepared by myself on the subject. 22 The information obtained by them in 1906 may be given in tabular form:— 3.642 births visited 518 = 15 per cent. unknown 266 = 7 „ out or dead 2,828 = 78 „ particulars obtained 962 = 34 „ Doctor attended 1,809 = 64 „ Midwife attended alone 50 = 2 „ attendance not stated 2,257 = 79.8 „ Baby breast-fed 291 = 12.9 „ „ „ and biscuits, bread, or other food 110 = 3.8 „ „ „ and milk 47 = l-6 ,, Milk alone given 99 = 3.7 „ Condensed milk alone 24 = 0.8 „ Prepared food 'The importance of this subject and the complicated nature of the problem involved in arresting it was brought prominently before the public by a National Conference held in London on 13th and 14th June, which was attended by the Chairman of the Public Health Committee and myself. The deliberations of the Conference resulted in the passing of the following Resolutions:— (1) That the Education Department be urged to add instruction in elementary hygiene with reference to the dietary and rearing of infants to their present scheme for systematically training girls in the senior classes in the practice and principles of personal hygiene and the elements of dietary. (2) That in the opinion of this Conference immediate lation is required, enabling Sanitary Authorities to establish or support depots for the supply of pure, or modified, or sterilized milk, and to defray the cost out of the monies available for public health purposes. (3) That, in view of the information submitted, the Conference is of opinion that all still-births should be notified 23 within 48 hours to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which they occur, and that no burial should take place without a medical certificate. (4) That notification of all births be given within 48 hours to the medical officer of health of the district in which they occur. (5) That in the opinion of this Conference the question of the insurance of infant lives under 12 months is one demanding serious consideration, and with a view to receiving reliable information the Government should be asked to appoint a Departmental Committee of Inquiry on the whole question. (6) (a) That the period of one month's abstention from factory work away from home now imposed on mothers be extended to at least three months, and that on their return to work evidence must be produced satisfactorily to the local authority that proper provision has been made for the care of the child. (b) That no employer of labour shall permit a woman advanced in pregnancy to engage in factory labour unless her ability therefor has been certified to the satisfaction of the local authority. (7) (a) That having regard to the ascertained fact that in centres of industries where women are largely employed away from their homes, an excessive number of deaths of infants takes place, and that this is contributed to by the improper conditions existing at the houses in which infants are placed out to nurse, it is necessary that the persons by whom and the places into which infants are received should be under supervision of the local sanitary authority. (b) That the Infant Life Protection Act be amended to remedy abuses which are not at present provided against. 24 (8) That all preparations offered or sold as food for infants should be certified by a Government analyst as noninjurious, and that each packet should contain its analysis. (9) That the Dairy, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order is defective, and that any amendment should extend the definition of disease as applied to animals, and should make the provision of regulations by local authorities compulsory. That the scope of the regulations should be extended to cover dirty milk, and should enable local authorities to prohibit the sale of any milk which fails to comply with the conditions of purity agreed upon. (10) That in the opinion of this Conference the appointment of qualified women specially trained in the hygiene of infancy is necessary as an adjunct to public health work. (11) That in the opinion of this Conference the Midwives Act, 1902, should be extended to Scotland and Ireland. With a view to endeavouring to bring about some beneficial practical result on the lines of the foregoing resolutions, the Executive Committee of the Conference arranged for a Deputation to wait upon the Prime Minister, who, together with the President of the Local Government Board, sympathetically received the Deputation on the 22nd November, 1906. Physical Deterioration and Alcoholism. —This question is closely associated with that of infant mortality, and in view of the evidence given before the Inter-Departmental Committee on Physical Deterioration, your Council, in common with the Corporations of many other towns, issued posters, of which the following is a copy, for the purpose of warning the indifferent of the dangers attending the abuse of stimulants. County borough of West ham. PHYSICAL DETERIORATION AND ALCOHOLISM. The Report of the Committee, presented to Parliament by command of His Majesty, states that— The abuse of alcoholic stimulants is a most potent and deadly agent of physical deterioration. Alcoholic persons are specially liable to tuberculosis and all inflammatory disorders. Evidence was placed before the Committee showing that in abstinence is to be sought the source of muscular vigour and activity. The lunacy figures show a large and increasing number of admissions of both sexes which are due to drink. The following facts recognized by the Medical Profession are published in order to carry out the recommendation of the Committee, and to bring home to men and women the fatal effects of alcohol on physical efficiency:— a. Alcoholism is a chronic POISONING, resulting from the habitual abuse of alcohol (whether as spirits, wine or beer), which may never go as far as drunkenness. b. It is a mistake to say that stimulants are necessary for those doing hard work : this can usually be done better without alcohol. c. Alcohol is really a narcotic, dulling the nerves like laudanum or opium. Its first effect is to weaken A MAN'S SELF CONTROL while his passions are excited ; hence the number of crimes which occur under its influence. d. For persons in ordinary health the practice of drinking even the milder alcoholic drinks apart from meals is most injurious. e. The habit of drinking to excess leads to THE RUIN OF FAMILIES, the neglect of social duties, disgust for work, misery, theft and crime. It leads also to the hospital, for alcohol produces the most various and the most fatal diseases, including paralysis, insanity, diseases of the stomach and liver, and dropsy. It also paves the way to consumption. It complicates and aggravates all acute diseases; typhoid fever, pneumonia and erysipelas are much more fatal in the subject of alcoholism. f. THE SINS OF PARENTS who have drunk to excess are visited on the children. g. In short, alcoholism is THE MOST TERRIBLE ENEMY to personal health, to family happiness, and to national prosperity.

Town Hall, West Ham, November, 1905. 26 Housing of Working Classes Act, 1890.—In accordance with Section 32 of this Act, the undermentioned houses were reported by the Medical Officer of Health during 1906 as being in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation:— 42, Bidder Street. 14, 16, 18, Frank Street. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, New Street, Stratford. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, Lea Street, Stratford. Notices were served upon owners with the following results:— The houses in Frank Street and Bidder Street were closed and boarded up, in which condition they still remain. The six houses in New Street were demolished by the owner. Nothing having been done to the five houses in Lea Street, closing orders were applied for and obtained, the houses were then closed and sold, and at the time of writing are being rendered fit for occupation by the new owners. Customs and Inland Revenue Act.—This Act enables owners to obtain abatement of inhabited house duty in respect of houses originally constructed or adapted by alterations or additions for the purpose of providing separate dwellings for persons at rents not exceeding seven shillings and sixpence per week, provided a certificate be obtained from the Medical Officer of Health to the effect that the house is so constructed as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons inhabiting it, and that due provision is made for their sanitary requirements. During the year applications were made to the Medical Officer of Health in respect of 120 dwellings, and certificates granted in respect of 114. Regulated Trades.—It is the duty of the local authority to regularly inspect and supervise bakehouses, slaughter houses, and common lodging-houses. Details of this have been given in previous reports and the periodical visits of the Inspectors during 1906 call for no special comment. Houses in New Street, Stratford, Demolished after Closing Orders. 27 One new bakehouse was erected at New City Road, and plans were approved for the extension of stabling in connection with a large factory bakehouse at the north side of Chaucer Road. The nuisances found and abated in bakehouses, slaughter-houses, and common lodging-houses will be seen in the tables in the Appendix relating to the detailed work of the Sanitary Inspectors. Fresh managers were appointed at, and their names registered as the keepers of the common lodging-houses, 211, High Street, Stratford, and 72, Great Eastern Road, Stratford. Tho common lodging-house No. 26, High Street, Stratford, was voluntarily closed and ceased to be used for this purpose. Offensive Trades.—A complaint was received from the Local Government Board, and a correspondence entered into between the Board and your Council relating to an offensive factory in Sugar House Lane. Frequent visits have been paid by your sanitary officials to this factory with a view to abating offensive odours which are emitted in the process of manufacture, especially in hot weather. The Company maintain that they adopt the best known means of obviating nuisance; but, even if they do, which is not admitted, their plant is frequently found not to be acting satisfactorily, and if complaints continue to arise and sufficient evidence be forthcoming, the Council will be compelled to again take legal proceedings. Application was made by Messrs. Hammersley for permission to carry on the trade of bone-boiling in connection with their fat-melting works at Bradfield Road, Silvertown. This permission was granted. Mr. W. Hornett was found to be bone-boiling upon premises in his occupation in Barber's Road without the consent of the Council. Your Public Health Committee visited the premises and recommended 28 that permission be granted subject to the erection of new buildings within five years. Your Council adopted the recommendation. An application for permission to establish fat-melting in Sugar House Lane was made by Mr. Zweig, but permission was not granted. Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order. — There are 21 cowsheds in the Borough, and the Inspectors of Nuisances report 59 visits to cowsheds during the year. With regard to milkshops 314 were visited. The latter are constantly changing, both in occupation and registration. In the majority the amount of milk sold is extremely small and does not, in my opinion, justify the vendor in running the risk of prosecution under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act. Veterinary Surgeon's Report.—Examinations (principally for tuberculous disease of the udder) were made of 322 cows, comprising all which are kept in the Borough for the supply of milk to the public. The location of the cows examined was as under:— Cows. Carpenters' Road 38 Warmington Street 11 Anne Street 14 Mason Street 9 Charles Street 1 Vicarage Lane 79 Church Street, West Ham 9 Maryland Street 1 Idmiston Road 13 Neville Road 6 Constance Street 3 Carried forward 214 29 Cows. Brought forward 214 Beale Street 13 Thomas Street 12 Edwin Street 30 Queen's Road, Victoria Dock 1 Poplar Street 14 Balaam Street 12 Whitwell Road 17 Blanche Street 9 322 EXAMINATION RESULTS. Animals examined Tuberculous udders. Acute or subacute mastitis Indurated glands. Dead or undeveloped quarters. Sore teats. 322 0 5 4 34 5 No true case of glandular tuberculosis was detected. The cases of mastitis were very few, benign in character, and such milk as was given I was satisfied was not used. The indurated and dead glands were milkless. The sores on the teats had no specific significance, a limited number of cases suggested constitutional tuberculosis, but in none was there pronounced wasting, and in every such instance the udder itself was apparently quite healthy. The cows generally were well conditioned and the sheds sanitary. R. GLOVER, F.R.C.V.S. 30 Factory and Workshops Act, 1901. Section 132 provides that the Medical Officer of Health of every district council shall in his annual report to them, report specifically on the administration of this Act in workshops and workplaces, and he shall send a copy of his annual report, or so much of it as deals with this subject to the Secretary of State. The following Tables are intended to cover the above provision:— Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1906, for the County Borough of West Ham, on the administration of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, in connection with factories, workshops, laundries, workplaces, and homework. 1.—INSPECTION.

These lists your Public Health Committee have found to be of little or no use to them in dealing with the general question of smoke. The lists are received so long after the alleged nuisance is stated to have occurred that it is impossible to act on the information received. 3,491 observations were made during the year by your own Inspector. In 1,083 of these hourly observations smoke was seen to be emitted from the chimney, and in 370 of these cases the smoke emitted was excessive. Removal of Offensive Matter Act, 1906.—Para graph 4 of Section 60 of the Metropolitan Police Act, 1839, which provided for the hours during which offensive matter might be conveyed through the streets within the Metropolitan Police District was repealed by the above Act on 21st December, 1906. The anomalous position in respect of the hours of collection within and without the administrative County of London created by the passage of the Public Health London Act, 1891, which was fully dealt with in my reports of 1894 and 1904, has thus been rendered capable of rectification by the adoption of Bye-laws prescribing hours similar to those in force in London. At the time of writing, however, there are no specified hours prescribed for the removal of any offensive matter from West Ham. 41 Collection of House Refuse.—The house refuse of the Borough is collected twice a week, the receptacles being placed outside the houses by the occupiers, and collected by the Corporation vehicles. The total amount collected during the 307 working days of the year amounted to 28,151 loads, a decrease of 201 loads on the previous year. The shoots on which the above house refuse was deposited are set out below:– Out of Borough. Ley ton Dust Destructor 2,021 In the Borough. Temple Mills (Messrs. C. Abbott & Sons) 8,109 „ (Mr. R.

The first case, Sanders v. Davison, was a prosecution in respect of butter, which after a six hours' hearing was dismissed by the DeputyStipendiary (J. Ratcliffe Cousins, Esq.), who allowed £20 costs to the defence. The following report of the case is taken from The Grocer:— Sale of Food and Margarine Acts. Siberian Butter.—At the West Ham Police Court, on Monday, before the Deputy Stipendiary (Mr. J. Ratcliffe Cousins), Robert 49 Charles Davison, provision dealer, 236, Grange Road, Plaistow, E., was summoned for selling butter which was not of the nature, substance and quality demanded. The case had been adjourned for an analysis of the sample at the Government Laboratory. Mr. MacMorran and Mr. Davies appeared for the defence (instructed at the instance of the Anglo-Continental Produce Company, Ltd., the importers of the butter under review). The sample was bought on July 4. The portion left with the defendant was analysed by Mr. Otto Hehner. The portion taken by the prosecutors was analysed by Mr. W. C. Young, whose certificate set forth that it was "butter adulterated with 11 per cent. of foreign fat." It contained, acording to Mr. Young, 9.8 of water, and its Reichert-Wollny figure was 21.8. Mr. Young said that most analysts were agreed that a standard figure as to the volatile acid fats should be adopted. He himself agreed with the limit of 24, but no standard had been fixed. He did not know at the time he analysed the sample that it was Siberian butter. He had analysed what he knew to be Siberian butter, and he had certified it as containing foreign fats, but he had in so doing described it as Siberian butter. In arriving at his conclusion as to this butter, he had taken 25 as the Reichert-Wollny number, but he usually drew the line at 24. By Dr. Sanders: It was by inference that the analysts arrived at their conclusions. The sample he analysed was deficient in soluble volatile fatty acids, or else it was adulterated with foreign fats. Mr. MacMorran said the defendant was summoned for selling butter adulterated with 11 per cent. of foreign fats, but now the ground was apparently being altered. Dr. Sanders: There is no word "adulteration" in the summons. The offence is that the defendant sold an article " not of the nature, substance, and quality demanded." In reply to Mr. MacMorran, the witness amplified his statement by saying that there was a deficiency of soluble volatile fatty acids, which in his opinion was due to the presence of foreign fat, but it might be a simple case of deficiency of other fats. Mr. Charles Simmonds, one of the analysts at the Government Laboratory, deposed to analysing a sample of butter. His certificate set forth that the soluble volatile acids were 23.76, and in the remarks attached it was stated that the analytical data, considered in relation to one another, did not agree with those of any other genuine butter produced in the summer months. The numbers agreed substantially with those that would result from an admixture of an animal fat adulterant with genuine butter. From a consideration of all the available data it was concluded that the sample had been adulterated by admixture with fat other than butter fat of not less than 9 per cent. By Mr. MacMorran: The origin of butter made a difference. He had had practical experience with Siberian butter and with that produced d 50 in the winter months. It was not a fact that it always showed a low soluble volatility. At Somerset House they had 2,000 or 3,000 samples of butter a year, among them from 50 to 100 samples of Russian and Siberian produced at all seasons of the year. The product seldom gave so low a figure as 23.75. When he analysed the sample he had no information as to the origin of the butter, which was treated as a sample of commercial butter. By Dr. Sanders: Assuming that he and Mr. Young had analysed the same substance and it was homogeneous, the differences between their results should not vary more than .10. By Mr. Cousins: In his opinion, the difference of 2.1 between the Reichert-Wollny figure he arrived at and the figure Mr. Young arrived at might have arisen from two causes; one was that the sample might not have been homogeneous and the other a deterioration of the sample. But in his case he tasted the butter and noticed no appreciable deterioration. If the Reichert-Wollny figure was 25, the suggestion of foreign fats would be 5 per cent., and if the figure was 24 there should be 10 per cent. He quite admitted that at certain seasons of the year butter produced in England would fall below the standard. This would be taking the standard at 26. But his conclusion that butter was adulterated was not arrived at merely by reason of the standard he had taken. Mr. A. More, of Somerset House, said he did the analysis with Mr. Simmonds, and agreed with the evidence given by that gentleman. Mr. MacMorran said the defence was that this butter was a genuine butter, the analysis of which was only remarkable by reason of its production in the winter in Siberia. To trace the butter from its source he would have to ask for an adjournment in order that he might call witnesses from Russia. Dr. Sanders said he did not think that need be done; he was willing to admit that this was a Siberian butter. Mr. MacMorran: Are you willing to admit it came from Siberia, where it was produced in April from Siberian beasts? Dr. Sanders: Yes, I'll admit that. Mr. MacMorran, for the defendant, said that the adulteration of butter with other fats was both costly and troublesome, and was perhaps only resorted to by the ingenious in Holland, which was full of manufactories for adulteration. Water could be used cheaply and easily, but here the fact was that the water in the sample was less than normal. The trade in this Siberian butter was a very large one, and the matter at stake was a most serious one. Siberian butter had been tested in various places, and in every case it had been decided in its favour, and for the same reason. The Reichert-Wollny figure of 24 for the soluble volatile acids was the test for the detection of foreign fat in butter, and the only substantial one. It was often assumed that this test had something to do with the dietetic properties, but it had nothing whatever to do with it; it was merely an arbitrary 51 means of enabling the analyst to say that if he got below a certain figure there was the presumption that something needed to be inquired into. In this case the moment it was shown the butter was made in Siberia the standard went by the board. The volatile fatty acids were discovered by the Reichert-Wollny figure, and the percentages of these differed very much. When they came to deal with Siberian butter analysts had to come to quite a different standard, for in the winter months the butter went down and down far below the figure stated here. In a case of this sort, where the interests involved were so serious, the prosecution should make out their case without the possibility of an error. Here there was but a presumption that the butter was adulterated, and the difference between 23.9 and 24 was a close shave. Mr. Robert Charles Davison, the defendant, said he bought 25 lbs. of this butter from Messrs. Coombs Bros. He sold the butter as he bought it. The traveller told him it was Siberian. William C. Neal, in the service of the Anglo-Continental Produce Company, Ltd., spoke as to the arrival on June 18 of the parcel of Siberian butter, of which ten casks were sent to Coombs Bros. The casks were sent straight from the ship to them. Edward John Horsey, in the employ of Coombs Bros., who prepared the 25 lbs. of butter for Mr. Davison and sent it away, said he opened a cask in order to get at it. They had no machinery on their premises for mixing the butters. Mr. H. Esmann, the managing director of the Anglo-Continental Produce Company, Ltd., of Great Tower Street, E.G., said he had been connected with the butter trade for many years. The casks were never opened except to sample them. They had no machinery or means at the wharf to mix butter. They did not deal in margarine. On June 18th they sold twenty casks of butter to Messrs. Coombs, ten of them Siberian butter consigned by a firm at Moscow. He was personally acquainted with Siberian dairies; this butter came from the mountains between Siberia and China, where it was very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter. Storage was limited, and dairies were managed in a primitive way. There was no means of mixing butter with animal fat in Siberia. Margarine in Russia was only manufactured in Government factories: it was not imported; if it was it would cost more than butter. He was the defendant at Thames Police Court, where it was said the butter was adulterated with 10 per cent., but the summons was dismissed. There the Reichert-Wollny figure was 22.1, being lower than in this case. Having regard to the large business they did in Siberian butter, if the standard adopted in this case was followed it would seriously d2 52 affect his business and trade in Siberian butter. By Dr. Sanders: Siberian butter had come much to the fore since 1898. His firm did not analyse the butter as it came over. Mr. Otto Hehner said the difference between butter fat and other fat was almost entirely due to the soluble volatile acids, which distinguished it from every other fat. The amount of volatile acids varied very much—the lowest was 16, and the highest 35.6; the 16 would be quite exceptional. He had frequently found genuine butters where the figure was below 24. When he spoke of butter varying in the Reichert-Wollny number from 16 to 34 it had nothing to do with its dietetic value. There was no connection between the figures and the inherent value of butter; it was but the figure by which they discovered the difference between one fat and another fat. It was difficult to mix foreign fats with butter; it would all have to be melted. Taking the Government Laboratory's figures as quite correct, 237 was a very low volatile; if he was told that it was Siberian butter he should say the usual figure was not applicable. Before giving evidence before the Select Committee he looked up about thirty samples of Siberian butters, and all of them went below the usual standard of volatile fatty acids—in some cases to 22. Cold weather affected the cows. If this butter was made in April and the weather was cold, the volatile acids would decrease. In England last April some cows gave low figures —in cases within his experience one 18 6 and two others 20.9, the milk being from perfectly healthy herds. Taking the figures of the analyses, each one of them was seen in analyses of perfectly pure butter, but some of them were abnormal. All of them should be taken in their proper connection. There was nothing in the figures which would lead him to the conclusion that there were foreign fats in the sample. The quantity of butter sent for analysis was too small to allow the submission of it to all the applicable tests, for which a mass.of 6 lbs. or 7 lbs. would be required. From the fact that there was but 9.9 of water and the absence of preservative, he concluded that it was Siberian butter. His Reichert-Wollny number was 22.8, midway between Mr. Young's and the Somerset House analyses. By Dr. Sanders: He appeared at the Thames Police Court, and differed then with the Government Laboratory analyses, but there were different officers then. (Laughter.) He knew of no butter but Siberian which came into this country without preservative, but the low water and the absence of preservative led him to the conclusion that this was Siberian butter. From a single cow he had discovered the lowest Reichert-Wollny number—viz., 16. This result came from a cow that had been milked for eighteen months, but at the time it was not known that it was an exceptional cow. Wellkept cows had given a low figure; it did not follow that an ill-fed 53 cow gave a low volatile fatty acid. He did not think the volatile acids affected the dietetic value. If one of the local authorities employing him had sent him this butter he would not have returned it as adulterated, nor would he have returned it as genuine without qualification. He would have reported: "This sample is exceptionally low in volatile acid, but not so low but that it might be a perfectly genuine butter." Mr. MacMorran said he thought it would be only fair to the witness to mention that at the end of his analysis was this statement: "While the Reichert-Wollny number is lower than the average, it is not smaller than is frequently found from Siberian butter, and the results altogether-namely, the low proportion of water, the absence of boric preservative, and the lowness of the ReichertWollny number—are fully in accordance with what I am accustomcd to meet in unadulterated Siberian butter. If this sample were an Australian or Argentine butter the Reichert-Wollny number would be incompatible with genuineness. If it can be established beyond any doubt that the place of origin of the sample is Siberia the results of the analyses are normal. I would suggest that objection be raised against the smallness of the sample, which virtually acts against the vendor." Mr. MacMorran, in reply to a question, said he had other expert witnesses to call, but Mr. Ratcliffe Cousins said he need not call them. Giving his decision, the Deputy-Stipendiary drew attention to the figures of the analysts as to the Reichert-Wollny number, which he said was admittedly of importance in the case. The standard was stated to be 24, and the prosecution relied on a difference of one point, which was an exceedingly small amount. If he fined the defendant he would be deciding in favour of a test which, after all, only raised a presumption, a suspicion. He could not possibly find that there was an appreciable amount of foreign fat in this butter. He admitted the difficulties of the medical officer. Such an analysis put forward against English butter would demand inquiry, but here it was admitted that what was sold was Siberian butter. He would find as a fact that it was genuine butter, free from an admixture of foreign fat, and dismiss the summons. Mr. MacMorran, asking for costs, said the prosecution were informed on August 4th that what was sold was Siberian butter. Dr Sanders said that he was merely doing his duty in the matter as a public officer, and he added that he was afraid the decision given would be a very serious one for the general public. He would have to go on with it till butter from Siberia was altered. Mr. Ratcliffe Cousins: I cannot help that. As long as we are a Free-Trade country it matters not a bit where it comes from, but where the analysis is so near as it is here I think 54 there ought to be costs, and nothing that I can give will cover the expenses the defence have been put to. Eventually his worship granted £20 costs. As reported, the case would appear to resolve itself into this: that the defendant was charged with selling butter adulterated with foreign fat, and that he proved to the satisfaction of the Court that he sold a genuine Siberian butter, to which no foreign fat had been added. The summons, however, charged the defendant with selling "to the prejudice of the purchaser butter not of the nature substance and quality demanded," and the point which the prosecution desired to maintain was that the purchaser (being a member of the public) was prejudiced in this case, whether the butter were genuine Siberian butter or not. The question is intimately involved in the methods and procedure of chemical analysis, and the inadequate tests which are at present available to Public Analysts in the examination of butter adulterated with small quantities of fat other than butter fat. In 1902 a Departmental Committee investigated the subject of butter analysis, and after hearing numerous chemical experts, Public Analysts and others, found that "All tests hitherto devised, whilst serving to distinguish with absolute certainty between butter and commercial margarine, break down to a greater or less extent when applied to the discovery of small quantities of foreign fat in butter—that is quantities such as 5, 10, or 15 per cent. When cows are exposed to wet and cold winds the proportion of the volatile acids is sensibly diminished, but when the weather becomes milder or the cows are housed, the amount of these acids—which are the characteristic acids of butter as distinguished from other animal fats—usually becomes normal." Butter coming from Siberia shows the greatest variation in this respect, but after obtaining information from all countries supplying butter to the United Kingdom, and hearing evidence as to the percentage of butters giving these low variations in volatile acids, the Committee found that not only were the numbers of such samples 55 few in the aggregate, but also that by appropriate treatment of the cows they could be practically reduced to vanishing point. Indeed, such a result has been obtained in Denmark, where 50 years ago the general condition of the cows was as wretched as that of any in northern Europe, but now by modern and rational methods of dairy procedure butter of a high and uniform quality is manufactured. The essential points to be remembered, then, are that the samples of natural butters giving exceptionally low figures when tested for volatile acids are comparatively very few in number, that the causes producing these low figures are well-known and are remediable, that the vast majority of butters give relatively high figures, a fact wellknown to the scientific adulterator, who not only can, but does, avail himself of the opportunity thus offered of adding small quantities of foreign fat to butter with full assurance that his malpractices, although they may be suspected, will not be officially detected by the Public Analyst. It was admitted by the Dutch representatives that it was a matter of common knowledge in Holland that butter from Brabant, where the majority of margarine factories are, has been adulterated for years, and that butter is sold from Friesland to be taken to Brabant for the purpose of being mixed with margarine and shipped to this country as butter." The Sale of Food and Drugs Act was passed in 1875 for the express purpose of preventing such abuses as the above. At that time adulteration was chiefly of the rough and ready kind—not as in these days carried out with the aid of modern machinery by skilled chemists. Also at that time Siberian butter was practically unknown in the English market, though of recent years, since about 1897, the imports ation of butter from Siberia has increased enormously. It cannot be questioned that in 1875, before attention could be directed to these abnormal foreign butters, the standard of average butter sold in England was higher in volatile acids than at present. In other words, where butter was asked for the purchaser expected to get an article of the nature, substance and quality of average English butter, and 56 although it has served the commercial interests of foreign butter merchants to import butters, some of which, by reason of the imperfect care of the cows, fall below the English average, one is surely entitled to hold that these commercial operations have resulted in the prejudice of the English purchaser. Indeed, the butter is doubly prejudiced, firstly, by the lowering of the standard which pertained for butter at the time the Sale of Food and Drugs Act was passed, and, secondly, by the risk which he now suffers of obtaining slightly adulterated butter which the analyst is unable to distinguish from a genuine but abnormal foreign butter. This view was clearly enunciated by a French Commission appointed in 1901, for the purpose of examining butters produced in the Netherlands. In their report the Commission state: "The defective conditions under which the cows exist when they produce butter poor in volatile acids justify us in considering these products as abnormal. In fact, if the chemist, confronted with butter poor in volatile acids, coming from Holland, and made during the months in question, cannot conscientiously certify that the butter has been adulterated by the addition of margarine, he has at least the right to declare that it is abnormal butter. He is even justified, in comparing it with the butter of our own country, in saying that in France such a product is not a marketable article." The case against Mr. Davison was instituted for the purpose of maintaining the foregoing principles, and, although the DeputyStipendiary did not feel justified on the facts before him of deciding in favour of the prosecution, the language of his judgment suggests that he was not entirely out of sympathy with the views urged upon him on behalf of the Council. In any case the interests of the public demand that the Siberian butter trade should be levelled up, even at the expense of litigation, for the present position is only too favourable to the dishonest trader. Nothing could be simpler than for such an one to buy a small consignment of Siberian butter, and a large consignment of adulterated foreign butter, mix the consignments (not the butters) together in his warehouse and then produce in Court his Bill 57 of Lading of the Siberian butter as a defence to a prosecution in respect of a sample of the adulterated butter. The second case, Sanders v. Sadler, was a prosecution in respect of milk, and shows how the warranty defence section of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act enables a vendor, with comparative ease, to relieve himself of responsibility for the purity of the article sold. The facts are set out in the following reprint from the Times :— King's Bench Division—(Lord Alverstone, C.J., Ridley and Darling, J.J. 1906, Oct. 29. SANDERS v. SADLER. Adulteration—Milk in course of transit—Place of delivery—Written Warranty—Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875 (38 and 39 Vict., c. 63), ss.6, 25. The respondent, a milk salesman at West Ham, agreed to buy from one Warth, of Notts, "about 16 barn gallons of pure new milk with all its cream delivered daily, carriage paid to Wanstead Park Station, properly cooled and in good condition." On a certain date covered by the contract four churns of milk arrived at Wanstead Park Station consigned to the respondent from a station in Derbyshire, the churns having a label attached stating that the milk was warranted pure new milk with all its cream pursuant to contract. The churns remained at Wanstead Park Station platform for about 45 minutes before they were handed to the respondent's servant by the railway company's servant, the latter not having tampered with them in any way. The respondent subsequently sold some of the milk, which upon analysis was found to be deficient in fat. Upon an information charging the respondent with an offence under Section 6 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, the Justices dismissed the summons. Held, that the place of delivery was Wanstead Park Station, that there was no evidence that the milk was tampered with after its arrival at that Station, and that the summons was properly dismissed. This was a case stated by the Stipendiary Magistrate for West Ham on an information by the appellant, Charles Sanders, against the 58 respondent, Emily Sadler, for unlawfully selling at 83, Neville Road, West Ham, to the prejudice of the purchaser milk not of the nature, substance and quality demanded. The following facts were set out in the case as having been proved at the hearing:— (a) On February 6th, 1906, four churns of milk arrived at Wanstead Park Station at 4.20 a.m. The churns were consigned to the respondent from Chellaston Station in Derbyshire, were labelled and invoiced with labels or invoices similar to the one set out below. The carriage of the milk was paid by the senders, (b) The churns were removed from the train by one Edward Bell, a servant of the Midland Railway Company, assisted by the guard of the train, and were placed on the station platform. Edward Bell then went downstairs to book tickets to passengers and to do other business until their removal from the station, (c) The churns were removed from Wanstead Park Station by Thomas Burrows, a servant of the respondent, somewhere between 5.5 and 5.10 a.m. on February 6th. The churns were handed over to Burrows by Bell, he (Bell) not having tampered with them in any way. (d) The churns were thereupon taken by Burrows to the respondent's dairy at 55, Woodstock-road, East Ham. (e) The respondent then, in the presence of Burrows and one George Johnson, measured the milk from one of the said churns and put it into a receptacle on a barrow in the same state as it was received from the railway station. (f) Johnson then took the milk on the barrow, and at about 12.30 noon in Neville Road, outside No. 83, sold one pint of the milk in the same state as he had received it to one Blanche Walpole, for which he received 2d. (g) The purchase of the milk was made by Blanche Walpole for and on behalf of the appellant and the sale by Johnson by and on behalf of the respondent. (h) A sample of the pint of milk purchased by Blanche Walpole was sent for analysis to and analysed by the Public Analyst for the Borough of West Ham properly and in accordance with the forms prescribed by the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875 (38 and 39 Vict. c. 63), Section 14, and all other necessary conditions and requirements of the said Act or amending Acts were duly complied with. (i) The Public Analyst on February 10th, 1906, certified that the sample was a sample of milk deficient in fat to the extent of 11.6 per cent. (j) On February 22nd, 1906, the respondent gave notice in writing to the appellant that she intended to rely upon an agreement in writing and a label or invoice as a warranty. The agreement was one by which the respondent agreed to buy from one E. R. Warth, of Notts, "about 16 barn gallons of pure new milk with all its cream delivered daily carriage paid to Wanstead Park Station properly cooled and in good condition." The invoice or label was as follows:—"Feb. 5th, 1906, 3 churns, Nos. 6, 18, 11. Containing 23 B. gallons warranted pure new milk with all 59 its cream (pursuant to contract). Signed Audinwood. To E. Sadler, Wanstead Park." The words "To E. R. Warth, Oak Farm Dairy,'' originally appeared after the signature Audinwood, but had been struck out and "To E. Sadler, Wanstead Park, substituted." The appellant contended that delivery of the four churns of milk to the respondent took place at the time when they were removed from the train at Wanstead Park Station. Upon these facts the magistrate held that the four churns of milk were delivered to the respondent at the time when they were placed in the respondent's van, and not at the time when they were removed from the train at Wanstead Park, and that the respondent had purchased the milk as the same in nature, substance and quality as that demanded of her, with a written warranty to that effect, and that she had no reason to believe at the time when she sold the milk that it was otherwise than of the same nature, substance, and quality as that demanded of her, and that she sold it in the same state as when she purchased it. and that the agreement or warranty and labels or invoices constituted such a written warranty as is required by section 25 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875 (38 & 39 Vict. c. 63), and the magistrate accordingly dismissed the summons. The question for the opinion of the Court was whether on the above facts he came to a correct decision in point of law. Mr. Danckwerts, K.C. (Mr. H. M. Sturges with him), for the appellant, said that by section 25 of the Act the respondent had to show that she sold the milk in the same state as when she purchased it. The true construction of the contract was that she purchased it when it was brought to Chellaston Station, or, at all events, when it arrived at Wanstead Park Station. There was no evidence that the milk was not tampered with on the way between Chellaston and Wanstead Park Stations, or after its arrival at Wanstead Park Station, but before Burrows took it away from there. He cited "Parker v. Alder" (1899, 1 Q.B., 20); "Lecky v. Ogilvy" (3 Com. Cas., 29); and "Parkers. v. Schuller" (17 The Times Law Reports, 299). Mr. Alex. Cairns (Mr. J. H. Menzies with him), for the respondent, having referred to "Filsie v. Evington " (1892, 2 Q.B. 200) and "Irving v. Callow Park Dairy " (87 L.T., 70), was stopped by the Court. The Lord Chief Justice, in giving judgment, said that he was clearly of opinion, and there was almost authority for saying, that the point raised by the appellant did not entitle him to succeed. His 60 Lordship referred to the contract, and said that he did not mean to decide anything contrary to Lecky v. Ogilvy" or "Parker v. Schuller." There were numbers of such cases to show that under c.i.f. contracts, and under contracts where the vendor had to deliver the goods to a carrier, that, as a rule, was delivery to the purchaser. But that was not the question here. The question was what was the meaning of the words of the present contract 1 The vendor was only described as being of the county of Nottingham. The purchaser knew nothing as to where the milk was coming from. She had no means of identifying or following it till she received it at Wanstead Park. If one was to read the words "Wanstead Park" connected only with "carriage paid," no place of delivery was named at all. It was clear that the place of delivery was Wanstead Park. Was there any difference between "to" and "at" Wanstead Park 1 In this case he thought that there was no distinction on that ground. It would be reducing the contract to an absurdity to say that the words "to Wanstead Park" did not indicate the place at which the milk was to be delivered to the purchaser, and as there was no other place of delivery mentioned this was a contract by which the property became the purchaser's and the purchase became complete when the milk was delivered to the respondent at Wanstead Park. As to the argument that because the milk was some time at Wanstead Park Station the respondent ought to prove that it was not tampered with there, the finding in paragraph (e) of the case practically amounted to this, that Bell, though he had other duties to perform, and it was not his duty to watch the churns the whole time, practically did look after them, and did not allow them to be tampered with. The burden suggested was an impossible one for the respondent to discharge, and to hold that she was liable to be convicted unless she negatived the possibility of the churns being tampered with during the short time they were at Wanstead Park Station, would not lead to substantial justice or to a fair application of the Act. The other learned Judges agreed; and the appeal was accordingly dismissed. It is needless to say that in the appellant's view the above decision is most unsatisfactory, and I think I can give good grounds for such a view. In the first place, the chief point upon which the opinion of the Divisional Court was desired, namely, whether the agreement and 61 label constituted such a written warranty as is required by Section 25, Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, was not allowed to be argued at all, the Lord Chief Justice intimating that "he was not sure that the point had been raised in the Court below." Where his Lordship obtained this information it is impossible to state, but I have ample evidence that the point was taken. Moreover, if the point was not taken, why did the Magistrate, in stating the case, set out in clear language that he held " the agreement, &c., constituted such a warranty," and asked for the opinion of the Court whether he came to a correct decision in point of law. In this respect the appeal was not an appeal, and his Worship's question, stated in what would appear to be plain terms, remained unanswered. In the second place, the point which was considered and decided by the Divisional Court was decided in such an ambiguous manner that it is difficult to feel sure as to the exact findings of the Court. The question appears to be plain, but the answer is distinctly involved. Mrs. Sadler was required by the Act to prove to the satisfaction of the Court that she sold the milk "in the same state as when she purchased it." She agreed "to buy from E. Warth about 16 barn gallons of milk, delivered daily, carriage paid, to Wanstead Park Station," and the question naturally arises at what point did the responsibility of Warth end and the responsibility of Mrs. Sadler begin; in other words, when was the purchase complete, or what was the place of delivery under the contract of sale? The case stated by the Magistrate clearly sets out this question—"The appellant contended that the delivery of the churns of milk to the respondent took place at the time when they were removed from the train at Wanstead Park Station. . . . the Magistrate held that the churns of milk were delivered to the respondent at the time they were placed in the respondent's van and not at the time when they were removed from the train at Wanstead Park." There is no ambiguity here. One says "the platform," the other says "the van 62 downstairs," and there is an interval of 45 minutes between the arrival at the platform and the arrival at the van. The purchase must have been complete at one place or the other, and the responsibility for the purity of the milk during the 45 minutes' interval must have rested upon the consignor or the consignee, according as the one place or the other was held to be the place of delivery. The Lord Chief Justice in his judgment says, "this was a contract by which the property became the purchaser's and the purchase became complete when the milk was delivered to the respondent at Wanstead Park." Does that mean at the platform or at the van—both were at Wanstead Park Station. If it means the respondent's van, it is exceedingly unfortunate that his Lordship did not definitely state so, because Mrs. Sadler's responsibility did not begin until the purchase was complete, and from the time the milk reached the van it was under the care of her own servants, who proved to the satisfaction of the Court that it had not been tampered with. What happened during the 45 minutes' interval would not in that case affect her. But if, as I am disposed to think, his Lordship meant the place of delivery to be the platform, then the contention of the appellant was correct and ought to have succeeded. There is internal evidence in the judgment itself to support this view. As stated above, had the van been the place of delivery there would have been no need at all for the High Court to consider the question of the possibility of the milk having been tampered with after its arrival at the station, but before it came into the possession of the respondent. The Lord Chief Justice, however, did review this question as if it formed an essential part of the case to be decided. He said "as to the argument that because the milk was some time at Wanstead Park Station, the respondent ought to prove that it was not tampered with there, the finding in paragraph (c) of the case practically amounted to this, that Bell, though he had other duties to perform, and it was not his duty to watch the churns the whole time, practically did look after them, and did not allow them to be tampere I with." How that conclusion can be derived from the findings in paragraph (c) is wonderful, but far more strange when 63 paragraph (c) is read in conjunction with paragraph (b). If the argument is sound it should bear a simple substitution process. Let the porter be a policeman, the milk churns a man, and the offence an assault; the above argument may then be paraphrased thus:—"The policeman says he wasn't there and did not assault the man. That practically amounts to this, that although he was somewhere else he didn't allow the man to be assaulted, therefore the man wasn't assaulted." This surely must be the legal analogue of the absent treatment of the Christian Scientists. The concluding sentence of the judgment is equally unacceptable. "The burden suggested was an impossible one for the respondent to discharge, and to hold that she was liable to be convicted unless she negatived the possibility of the churns being tampered with during the short time the) were at Wanstead Park Station would not lead to substantial justice or a fair application of the Act." It evidently did not occur to his Lordship that the burden which he says was an impossible one for the respondent to discharge is being constantly discharged by reputable milk vendors and might have been discharged by the respondent with the same ease and in the same manner, by the simple process of instructing her servant to meet the train instead of arriving 45 minutes late. Had the train been conveying a young child or a valuable jewel, Mrs. Sadler would have found no difficulty in discharging this "impossible burden," and in these days when local authorities are endeavouring to obtain a pure milk supply, the general public have a right to demand that reasonable care shall be exercised in the handling of such an important article of food. That 45 minutes may be considered a "short time" for the milk to have remained unattended does not affect the question of principle. If 45 minutes, why not 45 hours? Indeed, some months ago in connection with a previous action, I learnt that it was no uncommon thing for milk to remain at Wanstead Park Station for long periods, in one case amounting to 10 hours. Can it be reasonably suggested that Mr. Warth's warranty to deliver pure milk to Wanstead Park Station 64 was intended to cover such a period after its arrival as that 1 and is there any want of "substantial justice" in holding the milk vendor liable for any damage to the milk which may have arisen through such a want of ordinary care in guarding the purity of the article purchased by her? The Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, was passed for the protection of the public; Section 25, the so-called warranty defence, contains ample protection for the careful retailer; the public has a right to expect that Courts will construe the section so as to protect alike the careful retailer and the public, and not so as to allow the careless and indifferent vendor to escape at the expense of the public. I look upon the judgment of the Divisional Court as an example of the latter method of construing the section, leading, not to what the Lord Chief Justice desired, a "fair application of the Act," but to a most unsatisfactory application of it. 65 APPENZDIX.

Public Health Department, Town Hall, Stratford, 22nd March, 1907 WOOD GREEN URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL y. JOSEPH. With reference to the letter of the Wood Green Urban District Council dated February, asking whether West Ham would be willing to contribute £10 towards the cost of an appeal to the House of Lords in the above case, I am of opinion that it is most advisable for the Council of the County Borough to co-operate by falling in with the suggestion of the Wood Green Urban District Council, and for the following reasons: — On 18th June, 1896, Lord Russell of Killowen, in concluding his judgment in the case of Mayor, &c., of Eastbourne v. Bradford, made the following statement:—"I cannot avoid pointing out the highly unsatisfactory state of the existing legislation relating to questions of public health and to cognate questions of local government under the Acts dealing with that subject. It is entirely unsystematic and most confused, and in the public interest steps ought to be speedily taken to reduce the existing chaos into system and order." During the 13 years which have since elapsed, no change has been attempted in the public legislation relating to drainage, and recent legal decisions have, according to the highest forensic opinion, rendered it " impossible, save in the simplest cases, to advise local authorities with any kind of confidence." The reason for this is obvious, and was pointed out by Mr. Justice Channell in his judgment in the case of Haedicke v. Friern 187 Barnet District Council in 1904, namely, that in enacting Section 19 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act of 1890 an omission was made which rendered that section inconsistent with the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1875. Since then the Courts have been endeavouring to reconcile the irreconcilable, and, owing to the varying arrangement of the drainage of the different groups of houses, the general principles which the Court of Appeal appears to have adopted for its guidance are not such as can be applied with any certainty to new cases offering new features. By Section 4, Public Health Act, 1875, the word "drain" is defined as "any drain of and used for the drainage of one building only or premises within the same curtilage"; the word "sewer" includes "sewers and drains of every description, except drains to which the word drain interpreted as aforesaid applies." It is clear from these definitions, and was so decided in the case of Tavis v. Uttley (1894), that the common pipe or conduit conveying the drainage of two or more houses is a sewer repairable by the local authority and not by the owner or owners upon whose premises the pipe may happen to be. The lines A, B, in the sketches below are two typical examples of sewers constantly found in the drainage arrangements of ordinary dwelling houses. m2 188 By Section 41 of the Public Health Act, 1875, on receipt of a written application that a drain is a nuisance, the local authority may, after investigation, serve a notice upon the owner of the premises requiring him to do what is necessary to put the drain in proper order and condition. If the notice is not complied with, not only is the owner liable to penalties, but the local authority may themselves enter upon the premises, do the necessary work, and recover the cost from the owner. It will be noted that this section is limited to the word "drain " (the blue lines shown in the sketches), and gives the local authority no power to order work or recover the cost of work in respect of the sewer A B. It may also be noted in passing that the question of the ownership of the houses does not affect the definition of sewer. The lines A B are sewers whether all the houses belong to one owner or whether they belong to different owners. By Section 19 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890, it is provided that, "Where two or more houses belonging to different owners are connected with a public sewer by a single private drain, an application may be made under Section 41 of the Public Health Act, 1875, and the local authority may recover any expenses incurred by them in executing any works under the powers conferred on them by that section from the owners of the houses in such shares and proportions as shall be settled by their surveyor. For the purposes of this section the expression 'drain' includes a drain used for the drainage of more than one building." The first difficulty experienced on the passage of the above section was the want of a definition of the terra "single private drain." The view adopted in Self v. Hove Commissioners, which was followed in Mayor, &c., of Eastbourne v. Bradford, and generally accepted since, appears to be that it could only mean a common conduit on private property used for the drainage of more than one building. From this it is apparent that the question of the ownership of the houses becomes of prime importance. A pipe used for the drainage of 189 more than one building is only a drain "for the purposes of Section 19" quoted above, and Section 19 only applies to cases where two or more houses belonging to "different" owners are concerned. A pipe draining more than one building belonging to the same owner is still a sewer, and not affected by Section 19 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act. Joseph v. Wood Green Urban District Council is the last of four cases decided in the Court of Appeal, and it will be interesting to consider these decisions in the order in which they were given. (1) Thompson v. Eccles Corporation. Thompson. Johnson. In this case three blocks of houses (19 in all), separated by private passage ways, were owned as to one block of six by Mr. Thompson, and as to the other two blocks by Mr. Johnson. Each house was separately drained into a common pipe passing under the cellars of all the houses and under the intervening passageways, and finally discharging into a public sewer in a side street at D. A nuisance having occurred in the main pipe beneath one of Mr. Thompson's houses (marked in red at C), the local authority called upon him to do the necessary works. The Court of Appeal decided that the common pipe at C was a "single private drain" under Section 19 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, and that it was therefore the duty of the owner, Mr. Thompson, to repair the same. 190 (2) Haedicke v. Friern Barnet Urban District Council. In this case Mrs. Haedicke owned four houses (shaded in the above rough plan) out of a block of six. A common pipe taking the drainage of the house of the adjoining owner passed along the backs of Mrs. Haedicke's houses from B to C, receiving the drainage of each house in passing. From the point C the common pipe passed through private land and along the backs of several more houses, not owned by Mrs. Haedicke, receiving the drainage of these houses and finally discharging into a public sewer at D. A nuisance having occurred on Mrs. Haedicke's property, the local authority required her to relay her drainage. She objected on the ground that the pipe between B and C was a sewer, but ultimately she executed the work under protest and brought an action against the Council for the recovery of the cost. The Court of Appeal decided that the pipe B C was a single private drain under Section 19 Public Health Acts Amendment Act, and that therefore Mrs. Haedicke could not recover the cost of work executed in connection therewith. 191 In the two foregoing cases all the works required to be done were limited to the private property of one owner, and there would not therefore appear to be any hardship or injustice in requiring him to relay a drain wholly on his property and essential to him for the drainage of his houses, even though it may at the same time have served to convey the drainage of other houses also. In the following case the works executed were more extensive:— (3) Jackson v. Wimbledon Urban District Council. In this case sixteen houses in a crescent were owned by three persons. Twelve of the houses (Nos. 51 to 73) by Mr. Jackson, three of the houses (Nos. 75 to 79) by Mrs. E., and the last house (No. 81) by Mr. H. The drainage of Mr. H.'s house, No. 81, starting from point D, passed through the back gardens of Mrs. E.'s property, receiving the drainage of Mrs. E.'s houses, and entered a chamber on Mrs. E.'s premises at B. This chamber also received the drainage of all Mr. Jackson's houses conveyed through his back gardens from the point C. From the chamber B the sewage from the whole sixteen houses was conveyed by the common pipe B A into the public sewer in the road, the whole of the drainage being on private property. 192 Upon complaint of nuisance and subsequent investigation it was found necessary to relay the whole system. Notices were served upon the three owners concerned. Mr. H. and Mrs. E. in conjunction relaid the drainage behind their houses from the point D to the chamber B. Nothing further being done, the Wimbledon Council relaid the common pipe from A to the chamber B and the main pipe behind Mr. Jackson's houses from the chamber B to the point C. On completing the work the Council sought to recover from Mr. Jackson two sums, viz. (1) £13, being his share of the cost of laying the single private drain from A to B, and (2) £35, being the whole cost of relaying the main pipe from B to C. Mr. Jackson admitted that the pipe A to B was a single private drain under Section 19 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, and did not dispute the first sum of £13, but he contended that the pipe B to C was a sewer repairable by the local authority, and that he was therefore not liable to pay the sum of £35 charged. The Court of Appeal held that the pipe B to C was a sewer, and that Mr. Jackson was not liable for the cost of its repair. The Court was not required to decide whether or not the common pipe A B was a single private drain. That question was agreed before the case was heard. The Court apparently accepted the agreement that the common pipe was a single private drain, and therefore by their decision to have held that a sewer may discharge into a single private drain. (4) Joseph v. Wood Green Urban District Council. 193 In this case Mr. Joseph owned six houses (Nos. 18 to 28) out of a row of sixteen houses, the remaining ten houses belonging to various other owners. The drainage of the whole sixteen houses was carried away to the public sewer in a side street by a common pipe (shown in the plan A B). Into this common pipe each pair of houses discharged their drainage by a common pipe (shown in the sketch C D) formed by the junction of a separate pipe from each of the two adjoining houses. All the pipes were on private property. On complaint of nuisance the Wood Green Council required the owners to relay the whole of the drainage system. Mr. Joseph objected on the ground that his houses were drained by sewers. The Council thereupon accepted the objection so far as the common pipes draining each pair of Mr. Joseph's houses were concerned, and themselves relaid the said common pipes shown in red between the points C and D. Subsequently the Council relaid the main common pipe A to B at a total cost of £132, and sought to recover from Mr. Joseph the sum of £19, being the share apportioned on him in respect of the six houses of which he was the owner. The Court of Appeal, in giving its decision, assumed that the main pipe A B was, as alleged, a single private drain within Section 19 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, but held that as each pair of Mr. Joseph's houses was separated from the single private drain by an intervening sewer, they could not be said to be, in the words of Section 19, "connected with a public sewer by a single private drain," and therefore that Mr. Joseph was not liable for any apportionment in respect of work done to the single private drain. It appears to be quite impossible to reconcile the above decision with the finding by the same Court in the case of Thompson v. Eccles Corporation, a position foreshadowed by Counsel, who appeared for the Wood Green Urban District Council in arguing the latter case. 194 The pipe draining Mr. Johnson's twelve houses in the Eccles case is clearly a sewer. The only difference between it and the pipe draining Mr. Jackson's twelve houses in the Wimbledon case is that the Wimbledon sewer runs along the backs of the houses, while the Eccles sewer runs beneath the houses. If, then, in the Wood Green case Mr. Joseph's houses are not connected with the single private drain, owing to the intervention of the sewers C D, surely by the same reasoning in the Eccles case Mr. Johnson's houses are not connected with the single private drain under Mr. Thompson's houses, owing to the intervention of the sewer passing under the passage way separating the Thompson block from the nearest Johnson block. Further, if Mr. Johnson's houses are not connected with the single private drain under Mr. Thompson's houses (by the Wood Green decision), then, as Mr. Thompson is the only other owner using the so-called single private drain, it is not a case where two or more houses belonging to different owners are connected with a sewer by a single private drain, therefore Section 19 does not apply. Therefore the drain is not a single private drain. Therefore the decision in the Eccles case was unsound. On the other hand, if the decision in the Eccles case was sound, if the drain under Mr. Thompson's houses is a single private drain, because several houses belonging to another owner are connected to it by a sewer, then the decision in the Wood Green case must be unsound. How the Court can avoid this dilemma it is difficult to see. Some curious speculations arise out of the Wood Green decision. Mr. Joseph being relieved of liability as to cost of repairing the single private drain, upon whom shall the £49 be apportioned by the Surveyor. Shall he divide it among the other owners, or shall he apportion that amount upon the Council, that is, upon the ratepayers generally? It is obviously unfair to make the adjoining owners pay 195 not only for the repair of the main drain behind their premises, but also for that behind Mr. Joseph's, merely because he happens to own two houses while they only own one. It is equally unfair to place some of the cost (however small) upon the ratepayers on the opposite side of the road who possibly may not own a house at all. Again, if Mr. Joseph, perchance, had six children, and willed a house to each child, or if he sold the six houses to six several individuals, then at his decease or at the sale, as the case may be, the six houses would resemble the others in the row, they would fall within the wording of Section 19, "two or more houses belonging to different owners connected with a sewer by a single private drain," and the owners would be liable to the apportionment of which the one owner, Mr. Joseph, has been relieved. If, in the course of years, all the six houses again fell into one ownership, it cannot be doubted the Wood Green decision would be urged as a precedent for relieving the owner of liability for maintaining the main drain at the rear. Whatever their wording may be, the Public Health Acts were never intended to shift the onus of repair on to and off the owners of houses in the above manner, merely by the vagaries of testamentary disposition or the accident of sale. In order to show the advisability of an appeal to the House of Lords, or, better still, a thorough amendment of the public legislation relating to drainage, I append two or three plans of drainage found in West Ham, which differ somewhat from the cases decided in the Court of Appeal, and offer questions for consideration which can scarcely be answered by the decided cases. (1) Of six houses, Nos. 1 and 2 belong to different owners, and Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 to a third owner. Each house is separately drained 196 into a main drain pipe running along the back gardens and discharging into a public sewer in a side street by No. 1. Assuming the whole main pipe from C to A requires to be relaid what are the respective liabilities'! Clearly, the pipe behind Nos. 1 and 2 is a single private drain, but the pipe from A to B is a sewer— the mere fact that the line of pipes is continuous does not alter its character being such as to bring it within the definition of sewer, anc although the continuous line of pipes bears a similarity to the drain or Mr. Johnson's property, in Thompson v. Eccles Corporation, it must be borne in mind that in the Eccles case the Court of Appeal did not decide that Mr. Johnson's drain was not a sewer, nor did the Court decide who would have been liable had the nuisance occurred or Johnson's property instead of Thompson's. We may therefore argue that no apportionment could be served upon the owner of Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, in respect of the drain from A to B. If, however, the flow of drainage in these six houses be reversec into the side street by No. 6, as shown in the plan below, then the lint of pipes behind Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 from A to B is practically identical with what was decided to be a single private drain in the case of Haedicke 197 v. Friern Barnet Urban District Council, and consequently an apportionment of cost can be made upon the owner of Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6. (2) Four houses in F Road and two houses in A Street belong to four owners. Two owners possess one house each (shown clear in sketch). The other two owners possess two adjoining houses each (shown shaded on sketch). 198 The drainage of this group of houses is as follows:—The four houses in F Road drain separately into the common pipe B to C, and the two houses in A Street drain separately into the common pipe A to C. At the point C both these common pipes are received by a Y junction and continued by a single main pipe passing under the corner house into the public sewer F Road at D. It will be admitted by all that the common pipe B C is a single private drain pipe under Section 19 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act. By the decision in the Wood Green case, the common pipe A C is a sewer. But what is the character of the pipe C D? Does the single private drain enter the sewer A D at C, or does the sewer A C enter the single private drain B D at C? It must be remembered that the point of union is a common Y junction, so that the pipe C D is as much a continuation of the one as of the other. The Court of Appeal cases do not aid in the elucidation of this query. (3) Five houses, all belonging to different owners, drain into a chamber at the rear of the middle house and thence by a main pipe passing beneath the middle house into the sewer in the road as shown in the sketch. 199 Here again, is a case in which two or more houses belonging to different owners are connected with a public sewer by a single private drain, and in the event of the drainage system being repaired or relaid, a fair apportionment can be made upon each house. Frequently, however, instances occur in which two or more houses belong to the same owner. For instance, in the sketch below the plan of drainage is exactly similar to that in the previous sketch, but the two end houses on the right belong to one owner instead of two owners. The drainage of these two houses is exactly the same as that of the last two houses belonging to Mr. Jackson in the Wimbledon case, and by that decision the local authority and not the owner is responsible for the sewer B C. Moreover, by the Wood Green decision no apportionment can be made upon the owner of these two houses in respect of repairs to the single private drain B A, although that drain is as necessary to his houses as to each of the others. That an owner successful enough to to be able to possess two houses should be relieved of a burden 200 which he would have to bear if he only possessed one house, is a conclusion which will not commend itself to the average man. More complicated systems of drainage could be given and other points discussed, but enough has been introduced to justify the Council in agreeing to the suggestion of the Clerk of the Urban District Council of Wood Green, provided that in the appeal to the House of Lords it will be competent for the whole question to be authoritatively settled, and not merely the individual case in which the District Council is interested. During the current session of Parliament an attempt to remedy the confusion surrounding the application of Section 19 is about to be made in the Public Health Acts Amendment Bill, 1907, presented by Mr. J. W. Wilson. Clause 46 of this Bill reads:—"The powers given by Section 19 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890, in relation to two or more houses belonging to different owners shall extend and apply to two or more houses belonging to the same owner." The intention of this clause is obviously directed towards over-riding the position laid down by the Court of Appeal in both the Wimbledon and Wood Green cases. Whether it actually does so is a matter of opinion. It certainly offers the opportunity of further appeals to the Courts. Fortunately, the provisions of the West Ham Corporation Acts, 1893 and 1898, have relieved the Council of the liability for the cost of repair of any combined drains of the character shown in the foregoing plans, but as your Sanitary Officers are frequently asked to put into force the provisions of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, it is extremely desirable that the latter provisions should be made clear. 201 Memorandum of Agreement made the day of 1905 BETWEEN THE MAYOR ALDERMEN AND BURGESSES OF THE COUNTY BOROUGH OF WEST HAM acting as the Urban Sanitary Authority of the said County Borough (hereinafter referred to as the Corporation) of the one part and acting as the Sanitary Authority of the said District (hereinafter referred to as "The Council" of the other part WHEREAS the Corporation have erected at Dagenham in the Rural District of Romford in the County of Essex a Hospital for the reception and treatment of Small-pox Patients AND WHEREAS the Council and several other Sanitary Authorities of Districts adjoining or in the neighbourhood of the said County Borough have requested the Corporation to receive the Small-pox cases arising in the District of the Council and in the said adjoining Districts and thereby to avoid the necessity and expense of providing and maintaining separate Hospitals and the Corporation are willing to receive cases of Small-pox arising in the District of the Council for the consideration and upon the terms and conditions hereinafter appearing NOW therefore it is agreed by and between the parties hereto as follows that is to say:— 1. The Corporation will during the pendency of this Agreement admit into Dagenham Hospital all cases of Small-pox arising in the District of the Council notified to the Medical Officer of Health of the Corporation (on forms supplied by the Corporation) and sent to the Hospital by order of the Council or of the Medical Officer of the Council or of a Justice under the provisions of Section 124 of the Public Health Act 1875 with the consent required by that Section and the Corporation will provide for the treatment and maintenance of Patients coming from the District of the Council in all respects on an equality with those admitted into the Hospital from the Borough or the other Districts above referred to. 202 2. The Council will in consideration of the reception treatment and maintenance of the Patients coming from their District as above mentioned make to the Corporation the following payments (a) of the annual sum of £1 10s. for every thousand of the estimated population of the District of the Council which said annual sum shall be fixed according to the current estimate of the RegistrarGeneral on the 1st day of January in each year as from the 1st day of January . And (b) the Council will further pay to the Corporation the actual cost of the maintenance of the patients sent by the Council and the cost shall be arrived at in the following way. The actual cost of the maintenance of all the Patients sent by the Council the other subscribing Districts and the Corporation shall be ascertained on the 31st day of March and the 30th day of September in every year and such cost shall be divided by the number of Patients and the total number of days that such Patients have been inmates of the Hospital and such amount shall be deemed to be the cost of keeping a Patient for one day for the half-year as to which such account is taken. And the Council shall pay to the Corporation the sum that shall be arrived at by multiplying the said cost of maintaining a Patient for one day by the number of Patients sent by the Council to the Corporation for that half-year and by the number of days that such Patients shall in the aggregate have remained in the Hospital. In addition the Council shall pay the reasonable charges of the Corporation in respect of the conveyance of Patients to or from the Hospital (should the Corporation at any time undertake such conveyance) the provision of suitable clothing for them or their funerals or burials or the obtaining of any Magistrates Order which may be necessary in connection with such burial. 3. The Corporation shall within 21 days after the 31st day of March and the 30th day of September in each year transmit to the Clerk of the Council an account showing in respect of the Patients received into the Hospital from the District of the Council: (a) The name of Patient. (b) The number of days during such half-year eaeh Patient has remained in the Hospital. 203 (c) The expenses (if any) incurred by the tion under the concluding paragraph of Clause 2 hereof. (d) The amount due in respect of population and (e) The amount accordingly due from the Council and the Council will within one month after the receipt of this account duly satisfy and discharge the same by payment to the Corporation. 4. This Agreement shall not be construed as conferring upon the Council or their Medical Officer of Health or any nominee or Agent of the Council any authority or voice in the management or administration of the Hospital or in the appropriation or expenditure of any monies paid by the Council or in the method of treatment or maintenance of any Patient admitted from the Council's District but in all respects the Hospital and the distribution of the funds provided therefor shall be made under the sole control and government of the Corporation and their Medical Officer of Health Agents and Servants without any interference on the part of the Council but a duly authorised officer of the Council may during a period of 14 days after the delivery of the Account referred to in Clause 3 hereof inspect the Books and Accounts of the Corporation relating thereto by making an appointment for this purpose with the Treasurer of the Corporation. 5. This Agreement shall commence as from the day of and shall remain in force until the 29th day of September 1909 subject to the right of either party to terminate it on the 29th day of September in any year by giving to the other six months previous notice in writing. 204 IN WITNESS whereof the said Corporation and the said Council have caused their respective Common Seals to be hereunto affixed. The Common Seal of the said Corporation was hereunto affixed the day of in the presence of Mayor. Town Clerk. The Common Seal of the said Council was hereunto affixed the day of in the presence of Chairman. Clerk.
