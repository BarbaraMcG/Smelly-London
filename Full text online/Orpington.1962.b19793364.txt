TURNER. 7 To the Chairman and Members of the Orpington Urban District Council. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Health, although a weighty matter, is at the same time somewhat an imponderable, particularly when good health is concerned, for people's standards vary so much in what they can and do expect of health. However, when we come to consider Orpington's health, the majority would undoubtedly agree that it has a good record which was in no way tarnished during 1962. Notifiable infectious diseases were comparatively few, it not being a "measles" year, but in addition the number of cases of whooping cough fell from 122 in 1961 to 3 in 1962. One case of paralytic anterior poliomyelitis occurred, and this should act as a spur to those who may have been lax in seeing that their families are protected against this disease, and against diphtheria, which could also still arise unexpectedly in the community. It will be noticed that the number of doctors' signatures authenticated on International Certificates of Vaccination rose from 457 in the previous year, to 4,561 in the year under review, and this huge increase gives some idea of the repercussions of the smallpox outbreak which affected the country in the early months of 1962. Although no cases occurred in Orpington, one was notified in another authority's area not far removed from here, and a good deal of local anxiety was caused at the time. The problem of cancer is always with us, and although there was an overall drop in the number of deaths caused by this disease, yet deaths from lung cancer rose to 47 from 43 in the previous year. Although this increase is not great, it is a step in the wrong direction, particularly when we consider that the corresponding figure for 1953 was only 19. That the cigarette played a major part in most of these deaths is certain, and we no longer have the excuse that the association between smoking and lung cancer is unknown to the public at large. Indeed the facts seem to be very well known, but despite this, the confirmed smoker is always only too ready to find some reason why in his or her particular case, it would be more dangerous to give up smoking than it would be to continue the habit. One must be fair, and admit the abandonment of this habit is not easy, and that there is no apparent certain cure for the addiction, but it would be encouraging to see more people making the effort involved. This is, of course, a national problem with local implications and some small encouragement seems to be derived from the requests received by British Railways to increase the non-smoking accommodation on some trains, including those serving Orpington. In addition to the deaths 8 from lung cancer, there are also a number ascribed to heart and respiratory diseases, and here again the cigarette habit has undoubtedly made its contribution. From the vital statistics it can be seen that a further increase in the population has occurred, and the birth rate has risen by comparison with the previous year, but is still a little below the national figure. The death rate remains unchanged, but the infant mortality rate has risen a little; this is of no great significance as the numbers involved are so small and therefore a small variation involves a largish percentage increase. An entirely new feature of the year in question was the granting of customs facilities to Biggin Hill Civil Airport. This of course necessitated the setting up of a health control unit, in close association with the Customs Office at the Airport. The accommodation provided had to be adapted for use as consulting and isolation rooms and both these rooms had to be equipped and furnished. Arrangements were made with the three local general practitioners to be on call so there would always be someone to deal with any threat of the importation by air of any serious infection, especially smallpox. At the time of writing no emergency calls to the Airport have been received. The Government's final decision on the grouping of Local Authorities to form the London Borough, of which Orpington is to be part, was made known during the year, and as a result of this the other authorities concerned are to be Beckenham, Bromley, Penge and part of Chislehurst/Sidcup. This merger will produce a local authority of approximately three hundred thousand persons, and should provide a rateable value capable of maintaining services of a very high calibre on the health and welfare side. Here seems to be the opportunity of reminding members that the new London Borough will be responsible for all health and welfare services with the exception of ambulances which will be administered by the Greater London Authority. Although the loss of local government identity will be regretted by many, 'there can be no doubt that the additional responsibilities, especially in the field of health, will be very welcome. Although the personal services will not be as local as some might have liked, the centre of operations will be much nearer than formerly with the consequent closer association between the electorate and the executive officers of the Council, and this is surely an important facet of truly local government. I have to thank my deputy, Dr. Kelynack for his devoted service, and the annual repetition of this does not make it any less sincere. Similarly, I am greatly indebted to Mr. Crowe who has once again surmounted the many problems necessarily involved in his work especially as Cleansing Superintendent. My thanks are also due to all 9 the other members of the staff for their contribution to the smooth running of the department in 1962. In conclusion, my grateful thanks are due to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee, for they have all taken a great interest in the work and made the occasions of our meetings one of pleasure both for the Chief Public Health Inspector and myself, I am, Your obedient Servant, H. B. C. CARTER-LOCKE, Medical Officer of Health.

The Registrar General's estimate of the total population of the Urban District, mid-year 1962, was 80,950, which is an increase of 870 over the figure for the previous year. This population figure gives a density of 3.88 persons to the acre. The natural increase of population, measured by excess of births over deaths, was 636. The following Ward populations are based on the 1961 census population figure of 80,293:— Biggin Hill 4,086 Chelsfield 535 Crofton North 5,184 Crofton South 10,404 Cudham 1,243 Downe 1,107 Farnborough 4,828 Goddington North 7,844 Goddington South 7,709 Green Street Green 8,247 Knockholt 1,112 Knoll 6,052 Leaves Green 1,020 Petts Wood 6,880 Poverest 6,948 St. Mary Cray 7,094 80,293 Births. 1,407 live births appertaining to the area were registered during 1962, of which 727 were males and 680 females. 1,356 of these births were legitimate and 51 illegitimate. The crude birth rate for the Urban District was 17.4 per 1,000 total population,, (which is an increase of 1.1 over the rate for the previous year and is only 0.6 below the rate for England and Wales as a whole (18.0). The illegitimate birth rate was 36.3 per 1,000 live and still births, or 3.6 per cent of the total live births. There were 51 illegitimate live births, of which 23 were males and 28 females. There were 15 more illegitimate live births in 1962 than in 1961. 24 stillbirths were registered, giving a rate of 16.8 per 1.000 live and still births, and 0.3 per 1,000 total population. 14 of the stillbirths were males and 10 females. The stillbirth rate for England and Wales as a whole was 18.1 per 1,000 total births. 15 Infant Mortality. There were 20 deaths of infants under one year of age in 1962, which is four more than the figure for the previous year. The infant mortality rate for the year was 14.2 per 1,000 total live births, which is well below the figure of 21.4 for the country as a whole. The table which follows gives the Orpington mortality rate for legitimate and illegitimate infants, as well as for all infants, and also shows the comparison between the infant mortality rate in the Urban District and that for England and Wales during the past ten years.

I am pleased to report that there were no maternal deaths in the Urban District during 1962. The England and Wales maternal mortality rate for the year was 0.35 per 1,000 total (live and still) births. Only three maternal deaths have occurred in the Urban District during the ten year period 1953-1962. Two of these were in 1953 and the other in 1957. Deaths. 771 deaths appertaining to the Urban District were registered during the year, giving a death rate of 9.5 per 1,000 total population. The adjusted rate for use when comparing one area with another is 10.3. The rate for England and Wales as a whole was 11.9. Of the Orpington deaths registered, 385 were males and 386 females. The average death rate for the area during the past ten years was 9.3. The following is an analysis of the ages at death for the year 1962:- Males. Females. 20 were under 1 year of age 13 7 4 were one and under 5 years of age — 4 3 were 5 and under 15 years of age 3 — 8 were 15 and under 25 years of age 4 4 29 were 25 and under 45 years of age 20 9 158 were 45 and under 65 years of age 90 68 161 were 65 and under 75 years of age 91 70 388 were 75 years of age and over 164 224 385 386 17 Full details of the causes of death will be found in Table II in the appendix to this report, but the following table, giving details of certain causes of death in the Urban District during the past ten years, may prove of interest:— Disease. 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 Cancer (all sites) 108 108 134 131 131 158 172 159 169 155 Cancer of the lung, bronchus 19 25 23 34 33 38 48 33 43 47 Heart and Circulatory Diseases 285 320 262 264 284 328 348 321 382 384 Respiratory Diseases (excluding Tuberculosis) 81 44 79 135 88 119 107 110 90 104 Tuberculosis 10 5 6 7 4 4 4 3 3 7 Infectious Diseases 4 1 2 1 1 3 3 1 3 3 Road Accidents 5 8 6 6 5 10 12 13 12 9 Other Accidents 3 2 8 10 8 10 6 8 6 9 Morbidity Statistics.

Staff Medical Examinations. 114 members or potential members of the staff were given a medical examination during the year. 120 were examined in the previous year. 18 Unemployment I am indebted to the Manager of the Local Employment Exchange for the following information with regard to unemployment in the area during 1962:— "Throughout the year the number of unemployed persons has been higher than in 1961. January showed the highest figure with 269 unemployed and the lowest figure was 168 in June. The normal seasonal rise started earlier this year and the November figure (266) was nearly as high as January which is normally considered to be the peak month. There has been a general decrease in demand for labour particularly for unskilled workers." Open-Air Recreational Amenities. Approximately 292.28 acres of land have been secured for public recreational purposes within the Urban District, as under:— Parks and Recreation Grounds. Ward. Acreage.

Agriculture (Safety, Health and Welfare Provisions) Act, 1956. The responsibility of the Health Department under this Act is to ensure that farm workers have suitable and sufficient sanitary accommodation and adequate washing facilities. Atmospheric Pollution. Eighty-eight observations and visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors under the Clean Air Act 1956, during the year. The happy relationship which exists between factory managements and the Public Health Department continues and consequently any infringements which are detected are dealt with on an informal basis. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government prepared a map of the Greater London area and this district is not shown thereon as a black area. The district, with an acreage of some 20,000 is one of the largest urban districts in the country and is fortunate in having many open spaces, parks and recreation grounds. With many factories and dwellinghouses using smokeless fuels, the atmosphere is comparatively free from smoke pollution. The Council co-operates with the Fuel Research Station acting under the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in the measurement of atmospheric pollution. There are two sites in the district, at one of which a deposit gauge is positioned for the measurement of solid matter suspended in the atmosphere and at the other a Lead Peroxide Cylinder for the measurement of sulphur dioxide. At monthly intervals, samples are forwarded to the Council's Analyst and reports thereon are submitted to the Fuel Research Station. The Council is represented by the Chairman of the Public Health Committee and the Chief Public Health Inspector on the London and Home Counties Smoke Abatement Advisory Council, the National Smoke Abatement Society and the Standing Conference of Local Authorities which co-operate with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. 31 Cesspools. During the year, 107 cesspools were abolished. Twenty of these were on the line of sewers which were constructed before 1961, and the remainder on the line of recently constructed sewers at Leaves Green. The following summary shows the position at the end of 1962: — (1) on line of sewers constructed before 1st January, 1961 17 (2) not on line of sewers 2,286 Number of cesspools abolished and main drainage provided during the year 107 Number of houses with pail closets converted to cesspool drainage 2 Number of new houses erected with cesspool drainage 14 Number of loads removed from cesspools: On private property (subsidised) 4,959 On private property (non-subsidised) 654 On Council property 904 6,517 Complaints. During the year, 278 complaints were received from residents, but in no case was it necessary to take formal action to secure abatement of the nuisance. Diseases of Animals (Waste Foods) Order, 1957. The object of this Order is to prevent the spread of Foot and Mouth and other diseases of animals. The Order provides, inter alia, that where persons collect waste foods for feeding to animals or poultry, the foods must first be boiled for one hour in a plant licensed by the Local Authority. No further Boiling Plants were licensed during 1962. 52 licences have been issued since this Order came into force. Drainage and Sewerage. The trunk soil sewerage system is under the control of the West Kent Main Sewerage Board. Branch main soil sewers and main surface water sewers have been provided during the year by the local authority as under: — (a) Private Estate Development: Foul sewer 6in. 1,864 yards „ 9in. 1,144 „ 2 Pumping Stations and 379 yards 4in.

No instances of work in unwholesome premises were found, no notices were served, nor were any prosecutions undertaken. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952. No contraventions were found during the course of the year. Pet Animals Act, 1951. Licences in respect of six premises were granted or renewed during 1962 and six visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors. No nuisances or defects were found. The pets sold from these shops consist mainly of birds, fish and tortoises. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. The number of inspections and treatments carried out were as follow:—* Total number Number of of inspections. _ Infestations cleared. Local Authority's property 25 4 Dwelling houses (including Council houses) 5,275 630 Business premises 182 37 In addition, the Council's sewers were test-baited early in the year to ascertain the areas of infestation and this was followed up by treatment with poison bait in February. The degree of infestation was found to be negligible. Public Conveniences. In January, 1962, the management of public conveniences was transferred from the Engineer and Surveyor's Department to the Health Department. At this time there were four conveniences in use, namely White Hart, Petts Wood, Farnborough and Biggin Hill. Four new conveniences had been planned and during the year three of them came into use as follow:— St. Mary Cray (February). Green St. Green (October). Priory Gardens (December). The completion of the fourth one at Knoll Rise car park was held up for the addition of a room to accommodate a full-time attendant on the ladies side. 34 In order to maintain a reasonable standard of cleanliness in these premises throughout the day, the Council agreed to the employment of a full-time mobile cleaner who, in addition to supervising the work of the eight part-time cleaners and two full-time cleaner/attendants, is responsible for dealing with any essential cleaning during the day. One of the Council's old employees in the refuse collection service was transferred for this purpose and has proved to be an excellent choice. In the last six months of the period under review, no complaints at all were received from the public regarding unpleasant conditions in the conveniences. Maintenance and urgent repair work is carried out by the Housing and Estates Department. Rag, Flock and other Filling Materials Act, 1951. This Act is designed to secure the use of clean filling materials in upholstered articles and other articles which are stuffed or lined, or for purposes connected therewith. No contraventions were found under this Act during 1962. Rivers Streams and Lakes. Since 1950, the Kent Rivers Board has been responsible for the supervision of the two rivers in this area, i.e., the Cray and the Kydbrook. Sanitary Inspection of the Area. Total number of No. of premises at inspections and which defects or visits. contraventions were found.

During the year, two hundred and twenty-four inspections of shops were made and the following contraventions were found and subsequently remedied by the shop-keepers:— Neglect in displaying Statutory Forms .. .. 13 Inadequate heating 1 Inadequate washing facilities 1 Closing Hours contraventions 2 Inadequate facilities for meals 2 Swimming Baths and Pools. There is only one swimming bath in the district to which the public are admitted, and this is situated at Darrick Wood, Lovibonds Avenue, Orpington. It is owned by the Kent Education Committee, but is operated by Orpington Urban District Council in conjunction with the Committee 35 under a financial arrangement during the summer months, whereby, although it is normally reserved for the use of school children, the general public are admitted at certain times. The charge for admission is Is. 6d. for adults, 9d. for children, and 3d. for spectators. It is an indoor swimming bath covered with white glazed tiles. The water, supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board, is heated, chlorinated and then filtered continuously, this cycle taking eight hours. Three visits of inspection were made during the year by the District Public Health Inspector and three samples of the water taken for analysis proved to be satisfactory. Verminous Conditions and Uncleanliness. No cases of unclean premises were found during the year, but verminous premises were dealt with by the Department's Disinfector. Water Supply. During the year, one property was connected to the main water supply, having previously been dependent upon stored rainwater. Of approximately 25,000 dwellings, only 25 are not provided with a main piped water supply, and of these 19 are situated where a water main is not available in the roads fronting their premises. These are in isolated parts of the district and generally dependent upon rainwater collected from roofs and stored in underground (tanks, but three premises obtain their source of supply from a private well. The remaining six premises are not connected to a main water supply although it is available in the roads on to which they front. Two of these are a considerable distance from the road, but four premises are within 80 feet of the Metropolitan Water Board Main. Fourteen week-end bungalows are not connected to a main water supply. The total number of premises still dependent upon stored rainwater or well supply is made up as follows:— Ward. Number of premises with Stored rainwater. Well Supply. Biggin Hill 11 — Chelsfield 2 — Cudham 3 — Downe 2 — Farnborough — 3 Green Street Green 3 — Knockholt 1 — 22 3 The Metropolitan Water Board supplies the mains water for the whole of the district. The Public Health Department obtains samples of this water at monthly intervals from various dwelling houses throughout the district. Fifty samples were taken and the Analyst's reports show that they were all satisfactory. 36 The Director of Water Examination, Metropolitan Water Board, has kindly reported on the water supply to the Urban District during the year 1962:— " The water supply to the Orpington Urban District Council was satisfactory in quantity and quality during 1962. The supply to the district of Orpington was derived from Sundridge, Lullingstone, Eynsford, Horton Kirby, Orpington and North Orpington Wells. There were no new sources of supply instituted by the Board in this area during 1962 and there were no new important extensions of trunk mains, but a total length of 1,060 yards of local supply mains were laid in the area during the year. The following tables give the results of the chemical and bacteriological analyses of the various supplies to Orpington during 1962, including bacteriological quality of the well water before treatment." 37 Average Results of the Chemical Examination of the Water supplied to Orpington dining the Year 1962 Milligrammes per litre (unless otherwise stated).

HOUSING. 40 SECTION D. HOUSING. Clearance Areas and Individual Unfit Dwellings. At the end of the year, there were six houses remaining to be dealt with in proposed Clearance Areas and approximately twenty individual houses considered to be unfit for occupation. These will be dealt with by Demolition or Closing Orders in cooperation with the Housing Department who are responsible for accommodating the displaced persons. Rent Act, 1957. This Act came into force on the 6th July, 1957. The role of the Health Department in the administration of the Act is confined almost entirely to the consideration of applications made by tenants of controlled houses for Certificates of Disrepair. In broad terms, the possession of this Certificate enables a tenant to resist the rent increase permitted by the Act and the granting of a Certificate is justified only where the dwelling is in disrepair by reason of defects which ought reasonably to be remedied "having due regard to the age, character and locality of the dwelling". In recent years very few applications have been received and it is reasonable to assume that landlords do not now apply the permitted rent increases without first agreeing with the tenant the question of necessary repair. Housing Act, 1961. This Act extends and amends the principal Act of 1957. It seems apparent that the raising of the permitted Rent Increase from 8 per cent to 12j for improvements, as commented upon in my report for 1961, has not been sufficient inducement to the owners of tenanted houses to apply for improvement grants when they take into account the costs of their own contribution and of the essential repairs which have to be carried out to qualify for the grant. I think it is generally agreed that a bath, hot water supply and indoor water closet are necessary to provide a good standard of living and if this policy of improvement is to be pursued, it may be necessary for the Government to give compulsory powers to Local Authorities and at the same time offer all reasonable aid to landlords by way of grants and loans. 41 Twenty-five of the 28 applications for improvement grants were made by owner/occupiers. Housing Statistics for the Year 1962. Total number of valuation assessments, houses and flats, at 31st December, 1962 25,200 (1) (a) Total number of dwelling houses inspected for defects (under the Public Health or Housing Acts) 178 (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose 1,153 (2) Number of dwelling houses (included under sub-head (1) above) which were inspected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations, 1925 Nil (3) Number of dwelling houses found to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation 4 (4) Number of dwelling houses (exclusive of those referred to under the preceding sub-head) found not to be in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation 102 Remedy of defects during the year without service of formal notices: — Number of defective dwelling houses rendered fit in consequence of informal action by the Local Authority of their Officers 91 (5) (a) Unfit houses demolished 11 (b) Unfit houses closed 2 Moveable Dwellings. Sixty-four visits were made to the six caravan sites.

There is only one registered common lodging house within the area. This is situated at the junction of Poverest Road and Cray Avenue and its life is probably limited by proposals for re-development in the area. Renewal of registration at the end of the year was recommended on the condition that essential repairs, renewals and improvements were carried out. SECTION E. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOODS. 44 SECTION E. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOODS. General. During the year there were no outbreaks of food poisoning and only one of the forty-five single cases notified as suspected food poisoning was confirmed. This is a very encouraging state of affairs, and particularly to the Food Inspectors who spend so much of their time making inspections of food premises and who never lose an opportunity with food handlers of emphasising the importance of hygiene in the prevention of this very unpleasant illness. The general standard of cleanliness in food premises was found to be satisfactory. Food and Drugs Act, 1955. Food Sampling.

Inferior. REMARKS. No action. As the cork almost certainly came from the bottle's metal cap, no further action was taken. As the source of supply of the milk in question was outside this local Authority's district, the matter was taken up by the Milk & Milk Products Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and subsequent samples proved to be satisfactory. After investigation, it was arranged that the producer should mix the morning and evening milk together and thereafter follow-up samples proved to be quite satisfactory. This matter was taken up with the dairy concerned and a warning issued. The attention of the Manufacturer concerned was drawn to the deficiency in the meat content. The adulteration was thought to be due to evaporation and an appropriate warning was given to the pharmacist concerned. 47 Food Hygiene Regulations, 1960. There were no prosecutions under the above Regulations during 1962. A total of 915 inspections were made by the District Inspectors during the year. As a result of these inspections, 37 informal notices were served on the proprietors, and by the end of the year the following works had been carried out at various food premises:— Sanitary Accommodation: Cleansed and redecorated 4 Food protected from contamination 6 Soap, towels and nailbrush provided 2 Hot water supply reinstated 2 Walls and ceilings cleansed and redecorated 11 Floor repaired 1 Sink installed 1 Sink drainage board renewed 1 Food premises cleansed and redecorated 2 Waste bin provided 1 Dustbin provided for refuse storage 1 Water heater repaired 1 Doors rat-proofed 1 Ventilation improved 2 Structural repairs 1 Kitchen redecorated 1 New chopping block provided 2 Impervious working surfaces provided for working tables 2 Accumulation of rubbish removed 1 Food Complaints. Thirty-two complaints of unsound condition and/or contamination of food-stuffs were received from the public during the year, as under. Where the condition of the food could not be determined by visual examination, the article was sent to the Council's Analyst. In each case it was possible to give a satisfactory explanation to the complainant and restitution was made as necessary.

In addition to the samples previously mentioned, samples were submitted for bacteriological and pathological examination and other special tests, as under:— Milk (Tuberculin Tested) Bacteriological Examination 2 Milk (Pasteurised) Phosphatase Test 28 Milk (Sterilised) Turbidity Test 22 Milk (Channel Islands) 12 Ice Cream—Bacterioligical and Pathological Examination 37 Water—Bacteriological Examination 50 Water—Chemical Examination 1 Ice Cream. At the end of the year, two hundred and one premises were registered for the storage of, and sale of ice cream, but none for the manufacture of this commodity. Thirty inspections were made and conditions were found to be satisfactory. Thirty-seven samples were sent for bacteriological and pathological examination.

Milk and Dairies Regulations. Five dairies have been registered under the above regulations. The following licences were issued during 1962:— Pasteurised 2 Sterilised 1 Twenty-four visits were made to the dairies in the district during the year. Slaughterhouses and Slaughtermen. No slaughterhouses were licensed during the year, but licences were issued to eight slaughtermen under the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1958. 50 Restaurants, Hotels and Canteens. Ninety visits were made to these premises during the year. In five cases defects requiring the attention of the owner were dealt with by informal action. Butchers' Shops. One hundred and thirty-four detailed inspections were made of the forty-nine retail butchers' shops in the area. The butchers work in close collaboration with the Public Health Department, and during the year called upon the services of the District Inspectors in connection with carcase meat suspected of being unsound, as a result of which 1,498 lbs. of meat were condemned as being unfit for human consumption. In no case was there any evidence of unsound meat being exposed for sale. Bakehouses. Twenty-six inspections were made of the twelve premises during the year, and in four cases defects were found which required the attention of the department. Merchandise Marks Act, 1926. Nineteen visits were paid to premises during the year in connection with this Act. No contraventions were detected. Game Act, 1831. Five licences were renewed during the year. SECTION F. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. 52 SECTION F. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. General. Four hundred and twenty notifications of infectious diseases were received during the year, compared with 2,099 during 1961. The difference in the figures for these two years is mainly accounted for by the decrease in the number of cases of measles, there being 1,847 notifications of this disease in 1961 and only 253 in the year under review. Acute Anterior Poliomyelitis and Vaccination. One case of poliomyelitis (paralytic) was notified in 1962, and the patient was admitted to hospital. The County Medical Officer has kindly supplied the following poliomyelitis vaccination figures for 1962, based on the return submitted to the Ministry of Health: Year. 2 injections (Salk) 3rd Dose.

No cases of this disease were notified in the Urban District during 1962. The following table, details of which have been supplied by the County Medical Officer, shows the diphtheria immunisation figures for 1962, based on returns submitted to the Ministry of Health: Year of Birth.

Only one case of dysentery was notified during the year. 53 Food Poisoning. A total of forty-five cases were notified in 1962, one being admitted to hospital. All were single cases. There were no outbreaks of this disease. Salmonella was isolated in one case. No deaths from this disease were recorded. The following is a copy of the annual return forwarded to the Ministry of Health: Notifications (corrected). (1) First Quarter 12 Second Quarter 10 Third Quarter 18 Fourth Quarter 5 45 (2) Cases otherwise ascertained Nil (3) Symptomless Excreters Nil (4) Fatal Cases Nil (5) Particulars of outbreaks: No. of cases notified Nil No. of cases otherwise ascertained Nil Agent identified: Staphylococci Nil CI. Welchii Nil (6) Single cases: Agent identified: Salmonella 1 Unknown 44 (7) Salmonella infections, not foodborne Nil Measles. As was expected after a year of heavy incidence of this disease, notifications fell sharply during 1962, only 253 cases being brought to our knowledge, as against 1,847 in 1961. None of these cases was admitted to hospital and no deaths were recorded. Meningococcal Infections. No cases occurred in the area during 1962, there was, however, one death from this disease, the person concerned being temporarily resident outside the district when death occurred. Pneumonia. Twenty-nine cases of pneumonia were notified in 1962, as against forty-three in the previous year. Four of these cases were admitted to hospital and the remainder home nursed. There were fifty-seven deaths attributed to this disease. This latter figure includes people who are normally resident in the district, but who died outside the Urban District area. 54 Scarlet Fever. Notifications of this disease showed an increase, twenty-nine cases being notified as against eighteen in 1961. None of these cases was removed to hospital. No deaths from this disease were recorded and there were no "return" cases. Smallpox and Vaccination. No cases occurred in the Urban District area during 1962, but with the importation into the country of this disease during the latter part of 1961 and early in 1962, several suspected contacts were kept under surveillance for the requisite period. The Public Health Department was under considerable pressure for a considerable time as a result of this "scare", and one was glad that the policy of keeping staff vaccinations up to date had been in operation, thus avoiding anxiety on that score. With the rigid enforcement of the regulations applicable to International Certificates of Vaccination, it was necessary for the department to authenticate the doctors' signature on 4,561 such certificates. The following details of smallpox vaccination have been supplied by the County Medical Officer: Age at date of vaccination. Number vaccinated. Number re-vaccinated.

Mr. Crowe reports:— Regular weekly collections of household refuse were maintained throughout the year with only slight disturbance at Bank Holidays. Following the holidays, particularly Easter and Christmas, the work is very heavy. At these times, large accumulations of refuse await collection at practically all the premises when the men return to work. The severe weather conditions in the 1962/63 winter came after Christmas Day so that the disturbance which followed did not affect the year under review. As in my view it is essential to maintain a regular weekly collection on the same day each week and at about the same time, every effort is made after Bank Holidays to revert to the normal day and this is achieved by working overtime for a week or so. The method employed in the collection of household refuse is known as the relay system. Each team of collectors works with two vehicles and drivers, and at the commencement of the day's work, they divide into two collecting teams with a vehicle and driver. The divided teams work in close proximity and when one vehicle proceeds to the refuse tip with its load, the collectors join forces and complete the loading of the remaining vehicle. This principle is adopted throughout the whole day's work with the teams working either with one or two vehicles. Thus there is no waste of collector's time as with the single vehicle system. Collections are made weekly throughout the district from some 25,000 premises. A weekly collection of trade refuse is made from 300 shop premises and offices. A vehicle and driver and a collector are engaged on this work for which an annual charge is made. Collections of refuse are made from the numerous schools each week and three times weekly from the two large hospitals. Vehicles and personnel separate from the regular refuse teams are engaged on this work. The Council owns a fleet of 18 refuse collecting vehicles, eight of which are of the dual-tip rear loading type. It is the Council's policy, as replacements take place, to purchase this type of vehicle which enables the work to be carried out in a more cleanly manner than with vehicles which are loaded from the sides. Fifty-one workmen are employed on the work of collection and disposal. 59 All the refuse is disposed of by means of controlled tipping on low-lying land of poor agricultural value at Budgin's Hill, Pratts Bottom. The refuse is deposited in layer formation, consolidated, covered and sealed in accordance with modern principles of controlled tipping as laid down by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. The layer formations are arranged so that the final layer merges with the contours of the site. Completed sections are covered with soil, and then sown with grass seed, thus reclaiming the land and enabling it to be used as pasture. Two men are employed at the tip, a Fordson Major Tractor Muledozer being used for the levelling process and approximately 22,000 tons of refuse is deposited annually. The cost of collection and disposal compares favourably with districts of comparable size and characteristics. The costing returns of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government published in 1962 show that the net cost per 1,000 population for collection and disposal of house refuse was £580, and the net cost per 1,000 premises for collection and disposal was £1,800. The Abstract of Accounts prepared by the Council's Treasurer for the year ended 31st March, 1962, showed that on a unit basis, the cost of house refuse collection and disposal was £2 per dwelling per annum. SECTION H. BIGGIN HILL CIVIL AIRPORT. 62 SECTION H. BIGGIN HILL CIVIL AIRPORT. When customs facilities were granted to this airport, the local authority automatically became responsible for setting up a Health Control unit. A suitable room having been obtained, it was divided into two to provide both a consulting room and an isolation room. These rooms had to be furnished and equipped, and arrangements made for heating and boiling water which itself had to be laid on and a wash-basin provided. An approach was made to the three General Practitioners practising in the area and they agreed to go on a standby duty so that the airport could always call upon a doctor should the threat of importation of a serious infectious disease arise. The quarantinable diseases in which Health Control is interested are Plague, Cholera, Yellow Fever, Smallpox, Typhus and Relapsing Fever. A supply of fresh calf lymph for use in case of emergency vaccinations against smallpox, is kept in a refrigerator by courtesy of one of the local general practitioners, and the department replaces the lymph weekly, thus ensuring a constant fresh supply. So far no calls on the medical staff's services have been made, but the facilities must of course, be kept in a constant state of readiness, which necessitates regular cleaning. APPENDIX.
