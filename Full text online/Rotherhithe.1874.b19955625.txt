In consequence of the overflow of water from the river Thames on the 20th March 1871. the vestry caused all the public rights of way in the parish leading to the river, to be permanently raised to a heighth of 18 feet above ordnance datum, and also directed notices to he served upon the owners of property along the river side, requiring them to raise their wharves, docks and premises to a like height, to prevent as far as possible any future inundation from the river. The vestry having had to vacate the old stone depot. Well's Tenements, at the rear of the Workhouse, for the erection, by the Guardians of the Poor of St Olaves' Union, of the new Casual Wards and Infirmary, they obtained a piece of ground adjoining the Commercial Basin, of the Surrey Commercial Docks. Ploughroad, for the purpose of a Stone Yard, at a rental of £45 10s. 0d. per annum, including a right of wharfage, but exclusive of canal dues. The house No. 90, Paradise-street, has also been taken as an office for the Surveyor of Pavements at a rental of £20 per annum. The vestry have circulated hand-bills throughout the parish, cautioning shopkeepers, costermongers. and others, against sweeping or leaving refuse in the public streets, and calling their attention to the penalties they were liable to for so doing. The surface of the Burial Ground, Church-street, has been improved, the ground planted with shrubs, &c., and the footpaths gravelled, the works were carried out under the superintendence of Mr. E. Thomas, Surveyor of Pavement. The enclosure wall of the church-yard of St. Mary's Church having become dilapidated and dangerous to the public, the vestry caused counsels' opinion to be 20 taken as to who were the proper authorities to re-instate the same, which opinion was to the effect that the responsibility of keeping the church-yard and the enclosure walls thereof in a proper state of repair, did not devolve upon the vestry, but upon the churchwardens, and that any expense incurred could be raised either by a Church Rate or by means of the Poor Rate, under the 18th and 19th Victoria chapter 128 sec. 18. The matter was accordingly referred to the churchwardens, who have since carried out the necessary work.

The Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, Surrey. Gentlemen,— The low death rate which has obtained in this parish for several successive years, and which has placed its character in this respect on a par with the most favoured parishes in Loudon has undergone an increase during the year ending March 31st, 1875. The increase in the rate of mortality is not peculiar to this parish, but has prevailed throughout London, and was more particularly observed during the two last quarters of the year, it was probably due to powerful atmospheric influences, which caused diseases of the air passages and lungs to be unusually numerous and fatal in their effects, the most destructive to lite being Diptheria, Croup, Bronchitis, and Pneumonia. Zymotic Diseases. In this class the deaths are about the average number for the last seven years, the cases of Fever, Scarlatina and Diptheria have been more numerous than usual. Fever. Thirteen cases were registered, 9 as typhoid, 3 typhus, and 1 continued. Small-Pox. One death from this cause was recorded, and it is note-worthy that not a single death occurred last year. Scarlatina. There were fifteen deaths from this cause, a greater number in one year than has occurred since 1870, they occurred in the two last quarters of the year, and numbered 8 in the quarter ending December 31st, and 7 in the quarter ending March 31st, 1875. Measles. This disease destroyed 6 lives, which were not half the usual number. Whooping Cough. Twenty-six deaths were registered, being rather above the average number. 22 Diarrhoea. The number of deaths from this cause exceeds the average for the last seven years, 30 deaths were recorded. Diptheria. A striking increase in fatal cases of this disease, occurred in the two last quarters of the year, 1 case was registered in the second quarter, 6 in the third, and 11 in the fourth quarter, ending March 31st, 1875; during the former seven years, only 8 deaths from this disease were registered.

I intimated in my last annual statement that a larger increase in births would probably be noticed in future years, this expectation has been realized as regards the year ending March 31st 1875, one thousand two hundred and nine births having been registered, in the former year the number amounted to one thousand and sixty-nine, the increase will consequently be one hundred and forty in the year. An arrangement of the registered births into quarterly divisions will be as follows:- Males. Females. Total. From April 1st, 1874, to June 30th, 1874 131 126 257 „ June 30th, 1874, to September 30th, 1874 136 152 288 „ September 30th, 1874, to December 31st, 1874 170 160 330 „ December 31st, 1874. to March 31st, 1875 175 159 334 612 597 1209 Deaths. With a rapidly increasing population it is reasonable to expect an augmentation in the number of deaths, but the unusual increase during the year cannot be attributed to this cause alone, zymotic diseases, and diseases of the air passages and lungs have been more numerous and fatal, and these combined causes have raised the number of deaths, registered to 705 compared with 580 in the former 23 year the difference being 125. From the 705 deaths registered, we must deduct the number of persons, amounting to 13, who died in the St. Olave's Union Infirmary and were non-residents in this parish. It appears that 30 persons died in the Infirmary during the year, 17 parishioners of Rotherhithe, 8 of Bermondsey. 2 of St. Olave's and 3 of St. John'. Coroners inquests were also held on the bodies of 47 persons, and 17 were not parishioners of Rotherhithe, this number added to those who died in the Infirmary will be 30, and reduce the actual number of deaths during the year to 675.

The columns below represent the relative age of persons whose deaths were registers! during the last three years, and as respects the great mortality among the young, the record for this year exhibits as usual that nearly half the number of deaths occurred under ten years of age. 1878. 1874. 1875.

Bro., in the parish stone yard, seemed to be of great service during the severe epidemic of small-pox in 1871 and 1872 and in others of less severity that have subsequently occurred until it was taken down in 1874, and I regret that the vestry has not deemed it advisable to re-instate it in another place; by hesitating to take this course, our sanitary precautions have been weakened, and limited to disinfecting rooms, and the beds, clothes, &c., contained in them, and to cleansing and lime whitening the infected habitations. The dwellings of the poor often become unsuitable for human habitation, and are considered a nuisance; this form of nuisance, in addition to others engaged the attention of the sanitary officer and myself, 195 notices were served during the year to correct them. That part of the parish which receives its supply of water from the Kent Water Company, has now the advantage of an unintermittant distribution, the tenants of the houses appear satisfied with the alteration, and no complaint of a deficiency has reached me. The copious supply of water so long promised by the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company has not yet reached us, and the complaints of a deficient supply were as usual numerous during the summer months. Visits to the slaughter-houses and cow-houses were periodically made, and on these occasions they were found in a satisfactory condition. I mention with satisfaction that when the bake-houses were inspected, a marked improvement was perceptible in those which had formerly not quite satisfied the sanitary inspector and myself, altogether the bake-houses now appear to be kept in good order.
