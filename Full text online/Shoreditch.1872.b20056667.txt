A R E POET Of the Receipts and Expenditure, Assets and Liabilities of the Vestry of the Parish of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch, and of the proceedings of the Vestry, and of the Works undertaken and executed, &c., for the Year ending Ladyday, 1873. Published pursuant to the "Metropolis Local Management Act," 1855. N.B.—The Medical Officer's and Sanitary Reports will be issued separately. report of the vestry clerk. Gentlemen, During the year ending Lady-day, 1873. the amount Collected by the Poor's Rate was £66,520 14s. 9d.; the amount in the pound levied for the four quarters was 2s. 11d., being for the quarter to Midsummer, 1872, 10d.; to Michaelmas, 10d.; to Christmas, 9d.; and to Lady-day, 1873, 6d. The gross amount levied was £64,684 from which has to be deducted losses from defaulters, excused, vacant premises, and allowances to owners, equal in all to about 13 per cent, of the gross sum charged. The excess of the collection over the amount levied is owing to the higher rate of the previous year being included in this year's collection. The mode in which this sum has been expended will be seen by reference to the statement signed by the Poor Law Auditor given in the Accountant's Report. At Lady-day, 1872, the Vestry was indebted to the Gruardians on Contribution Orders £13,500, and at the same period, 1873, £7000. The amount of the Gruardians Contribution Orders for the year ending Lady-day, 1872, was £60,000, and for the year ending Ladyday, 1873, £44,000. Further particulars will be found in the Balance Sheet given with the Accountant's Report. 6 SEWERS AND GENERAL RATES. The Accountant's statement hereto appended will give the details of the receipts and expenditure on account of the Sowers and General Hates. It is only necessary here to state that the rates levied for the Inst two years, were 1872. 1873. General in the £. 1/5 1/6 Sowers ditto 4d. 4d. STATE OF COLLECTION. The total rates levied for the four quarters ending Lady-day, 1872, Poor mid Vestry inclusive, was £129,094, and at that period there was uncollected, including irrecoverable and allowances to owners, £34,876, being a proportion of 27.5 per cent. to the amount levied. The total amount levied for the corresponding period, 1873, was £105,221, and the amount uncollected at Lady-day, was £21,879, being a proportion of 20.2 per cent., consequently the state of the collection has improved during the past year by nearly seven and a half per cent, on the total levy of the year, or by more than one-fourth of the arrears. This may bo owing partly to the lower rates, partly to more prosperous times, and partly to the efforts made by the Finance Committee and the Collectors to accelerate the collection. ASSESSMENTS. The Provisional and Supplemental Valuation Lists for the year have been duly prepared, and the totals for the present year are fixed at £558,375 ,15s. gross value, and £445,490 10s. rateable value. The totals for the Metropolitan District, are, gross value £24,810,481, and the rateable value £20,391,124. It is upon the total rateable value that the Police, County, Metropolitan Board's, School Board's, and other charges are levied. In my Inst report I alluded to the appeal then pending by the Guardians of the Holborn Union against the assessment of St. Luke's Workhouse. By the Local Act the Workhouse of St. Luke is to be nominally rated so long as it is used for the maintenance of the Poor of St. Lukes. The Vestry were informed by Counsel's opinion carefully prepared, that this exemption would not extend to the Holborn Union, of which St. Luke's now forms a part. It was agreed to submit the point to the Queen's Bench by Special case. The argument was 7 opened, but stopped by the judges with an intimation that the exemption had ceased, but with liberty to the appellants to amend the case. The case was amended by inserting therein the fact, that an allowance was made to the Parish of St. Luke by the Union equivalent to the annual value of the Workhouse, the property of the parish. The case was re-argued during the last Easter term before a differently constituted court, and judgment was given in favor of the appellants, to the effect that so long as the premises were used for the maintenance of any portion of the poor of St. Luke's it was exempt from rating. Not only does this exemption apply to the original Workhouse of St. Luke's, but to an additional Infirmary erected at the cost of the Holborn Union, and will also to an additional building now in course of erection. Thus while the parish of Shoreditch is assessed for its Workhouse and the amount being included in the total of the Valuation List, the ratepayers of Shoreditch are charged upon the same in respect to all Metropolitan purposes probably to the extent of 2/- in the £, the ratepayers of Holborn Union are not charged in respect to the same purposes, and therefore in fact the ratepayers of Shoreditch and the Metropolis are taxed for the relief of the ratepayers of the Holborn Union. In 1871 the Government introduced a Bill to abolish all exemptions from rating conferred by Local Acts, but it was not proceeded with. This year the Government has three Bills in Parliament dealing with assessment and making and collecting of rates, but there is very little prospect of any of them passing.* METROPOLITAN IMPROVEMENTS. The Act of Parliament which the Metropolitan Board obtained last Session for the widening of the High Street, and the making of a new Street from Old Street to Shoreditch, &c., has been been put into operation; the works have not actually commenced, but the Metropolitan Board is actively engaged in settling the claims for compensation involved, and the actual works may be expected to commence in a short time. LOCAL IMPROVEMENTS. The Vestry has availed itself of an opportunity offered by the Haberdasher's Company to widen the opening of East Street into * The Eating (Liability and. Value) Bill has been rejected by the House of Lords, the others were -withdrawn by the Government. 8 Hoxton Street. The Haberdasher's Company give up a portion of the ground required, and the Vestry has agreed to purchase of other owners the remainder. The cost will be about £1600. The Metropolitan Board has consented to pay one-half of the same. The arrangement made last year with the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for the opening up of the thoroughfare from Luke Street to Curtain Road, through Charles Street, with some other alterations in the vicinity, has been carried out in accordance with the terms of the agreement mentioned in the last annual report. TRAMWAYS. The North Metropolitan Tramway Company gave notice of a Bill to extend the Tramway from Hackney Road to White Lion Street, Norton Folgate. The Metropolitan Board refused its consent and all Tramway extensions were struck out of the Bill. The amount which the Tramway Company has paid the Vestry for pavements taken by them was, to Lady-day last, £4259; since then £1500 has been paid for Hackney Road, and about £1500 will be received when the New North Road line is commenced. RAILWAYS, &c. The only Railway Bill affecting the parish this Session was one promoted by the London and North Western Railway Company which inter alia authorises the purchase by the Company of the site of the Chartered Gas Works in Worship Street, but the Vestry obtained through the Metropolitan Board, a clause giving the Vestry power to purchase a portion of the same for the widening of Worship Street, at the value of vacant land. The Vestry is in communication with the Metropolitan Board upon the question of effecting this Improvement.* THE PROPOSED MORTUARY. A preliminary agreement has been made between the Vestry and tho North London Railway for the exchange of land, by which a suitable site for a Mortuary will be placed at the command of the Vestry. It is situate in William Street, Curtain Road, thoroughly screened from observation, and altogether free from the objections which hitherto have made the provision of a Mortuary in the Parish next to impossible. • The Metropolitan Board has since agreed to effect this improvement. 9 DISORDERLY HOUSES. No prosecution for disorderly houses has taken place this year, but warnings have been issued to all that have been brought under notice, which in most cases have had the desired effect. Prosecutions will be directed in cases where a nuisance is complained of and proved, and where the warnings are unheeded. THE TOWN HALL. During the year the Large Hall has been let 181 times; the Council Chamber 35 times; the Committee Rooms have been frequently used by Local Societies, School Board Committees, &c. mostly free of charge. The receipts for letting were £1039 10s.; the amount paid for cleaning after letting, £123; the cost of Gas for the year, including consumption in Office, Yestry Meetings, &c., was £211 12s.; Insurance, window cleaning and repairs amounted to about £80, but a larger sum must be charged against the year for wear and tear. The expenses may be estimated at one-third of the receipts, the remaining two-thirds are applicable towards payment of interest on the Building Loan. The interest paid by the Yestry on the Building Loans during the last four years, was To Lady-day, 1870 £1268 7 8 1871 1221 13 4 . 1872 1174 19 8 1873 1118 6 8 The principal repayable each year is £933. COLLECTION OF RATES. (allowance to owners.) On the passing of tho Assessed Rates and Collection Act, 1869, the Vestry adopted the 4th section, making it compulsory for all owners of tenements rated at £20 and under to be rated, and for the Vestry to allow 15 per cent, to all such owners. An additional 15 per cent, was allowed to such owners as agreed to pay the rates for all such tenements, 10 whether full or empty. This system had been in partial operation from the passing of the Act in 1869, to Midsummer, 1872,—partial, because all owners were not rated, and it was found not only undesirable but next to impossible to rate all tho owners who did not desire to be rated and where the tenants were willing to be rated and to pay the rates. The Yestry determined to reeonsider this arrangement, and referred the question to the Finance Committee. After giving the subject a careful consideration and comparing the practice of this parish with that of other similar parishes, the Committee recommended the Yestry to rescind the former resolution and to act under the 3rd Section of the Act, which enables the Yestry and owners mutually to agree, without compulsion on either side, and the owners to pay the rates and receive an allowance. The maximum allowance under this Section is 25 per cent, and this is the scale adopted, and is to take effect from the present Midsummer. There will therefore bo a proper agreement between all owners and tho Yestry where the allowance is asked and given, and there will bo no longer a 15 per cent, and a 30 per cent, allowance, but an uniform scale of allowance of 25 per cent. It is anticipated that the difference of 5 per cent, in the allowance will be a saving to tho Yestry of about £1000 per year,—and this is important, seeing that the amounts which the parish has to pay to the Police, County, School Board, Metropolitan Board, &c. are calculated upon the fall rateable value of the property, and not upon the nett amount of rates received. ADULTERATION OF FOOD ACT. The appointment of an Analyst for this Parish, was under consideration at the end of the official year. Since then, viz. in May, Dr. Stevenson, Professor of Chemistry at Guy's Hospital, has been appointed the analyst for this parish, for one year, at a salary of £50, with 10s. for each analysis ; and the appointment has been approved by the Local Government Board. The Vestry has fixed 2s.6d. as the fee to be paid by purchasers of articles on submitting the same for examination. 11 SALARIES. During the year the Vestry has revised the Salaries of some of its Officers, as follows: Vestry Clerk £250 to £300 Assistant Clerk £100 to £110 with an increase of £10 per year until £150 is reached. Accountant £200 to £220 Assistant Surveyor £100 to £120 Mr. Drake,—Rate Clerk £110 to £120 Mr Young ditto £80 to £100 Mr. Jones ditto £80 to £100 Mr. Robinson,—Inspector £80 to £110 Mr. Bennett,—Clerk in Sanitary office 10s. to 15s. per week Mr. Russell,—Messenger 30s. to 35s. per week No alteration has been made in the remuneration of the Medical Officer, Surveyor, Mr. Dennis, Inspector, Rate Collectors, and Hall Keeper. Appended is a list of the Contracts taken by the Yestry for the Year, with other requisite information. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, E. WALKER, Vestry Clerk. Town Hall, Old Street, June, 1873. REPORT OF THE ACCOUNTANT. To the Vestry of St. Leonard, Shoredity Gentlemen, In accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, I have pleasure to submit the annexed statement of Receipts and Disbursements by the Vestry for the year ending on the 25th March, 1873; and, on reference thereto, it will be seen that the amount raised during the year by Poor and Vestry Rates alone amounted to the sum of £103,077 16s. 1d., there being a balance in the hands of the Treasurer of receipts over expenditure on the Poor rate of £5030 9s. 9d., and on the Vestry rates of £5576 7s. 8d. to be carried forward to the account of the next financial year. There has been a decrease of Poor rate collected during the year of £17,223 3s. 11d., as compared with the amount collected during the preceding year, which shows an improved state of things so far as the relief of the poor is concerned, and the diminution of parochial burdens imposed by law, under that charge, upon the ratepayers; still there is an increase in the gross amount of Vestry rates collected of £4689 16s. 1d. as compared with the total collection for municipal purposes under this head during the year ending Lady-day, 1872. The chief items of expenditure comprised payments to the Guardians of the Poor, on precepts, £44,000; County and Lunatic Asylum rate, £6,476 10s. 0d.; Police, £12,450 7s. 9d.; Collectors' Poundage and Salaries, £1,731 1s. 2d.; Parliamentary Registration, £498 12s. 3d.; repayment of Loans and Interest, £8,874 4s. 9d.; the Metropolitan Board of Works, £4,523 6s. 6d.; and tho London School Board, £1,643 3s. 1d. It will be likewise seen that under column 14 headed "Hire of Town Hall," the amount realised by letting the same during the year 1872-3 was £1,039 10s. 0d., a sum in excess by £341 5s. 0d. of that received during the year 1871-2. The other minor items are specified in the several respective columns, as they appear in the tabular statements appended to this report. It may be further stated that one penny in the pound on the assessment of property in the parish produced, last year, £1650 19s. 6d., and that the amount of losses caused by removals, empties, and allowances to owners under the Assessed Rates Act, with other sums allowed by the magistrates on account of poverty, was only £10 11s. 6d. per cent, upon the gross collection, which affords ample ground for congratulating the Vestry on the satisfactory condition of the parochial exchequer. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. E. COLE, Accountant to the Vestry.

East Division 989 West Division 1094 As regards the general condition of the parish, I beg to state that the carriageway paving is in very good order, as the greater portion of it is composed of new work; there are a few places which must before long be repaved, such as High Street, Shoreditch, (from Bateman's Row to the boundary) And, Hoxton Street (portions of.) 23 The footways are mostly in an unsatisfactory and dilapidated condition, and the repairs during the year having been very slight, unless some of the worst places are very shortly repaved they will become dangerous. A very large quantity of new work has been ordered and commenced since Lady-day last, and is now in progress. The condition of the sewerage is very satisfactory, the sewers being comparatively free from deposit, and there being but few places in the parish without efficient means of drainage. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, GEORGE CHAS. PERRETT, Town Hall, Surveyor. June, 1873. 24 APPENDIX B.
