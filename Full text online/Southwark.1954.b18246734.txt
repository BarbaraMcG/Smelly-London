The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Metropolitan Borough of Southwark. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to submit the Annual Report of the Health Department for the year 1954. The population figure of 95,370, as estimated by the Registrar General, shows a further decline of 1,500 persons on the previous year's figure. The General Death rate of 11.5, and the infant mortality rate of 20.6, are both near records. The infectious diseases also showed a considerable decline. The year 1954 may therefore be regarded as a healthy one, as indicated by the statistics kept by your Department. Before leaving the subject of infection, I would like to draw special attention to the question of Food Poisoning and Dysentery; both of which remained unnecessarily high. I repeat unnecessarily high because the cause and spread of these infections is largely dependent on the personal hygiene of our food handlers and the population as a whole; a high incidence, except in exceptional instances, is a reflection of our personal habits. The continued high incidence of Dysentery caused me much anxiety, and I decided to issue a leaflet on the subject, drawn up in simple but straightforward language, as follows:— "Dysentery is a highly contagious acute diarrhoeal disease, the motions often containing blood and mucous. It is caused by a germ which gains entrance to the body through the mouth. The commonest method of spread is by "infected" hands—fouled after use of W.C. A person suffering from Dysentery may infect the W.C. seat, the lavatory chain and handle, and also door handle; and in this way infect another person using the same W.C. shortly after. ii Unless strict personal hygiene is practised, and particularly washing after use of toilet, any food handler thus infected can infect food and spread the disease to many other people. A whole household can be infected by the housewife, should she herself be a victim of the disease or gets her hands contaminated with the dysentery germs, if she prepares the family meals without first taking the simple precaution of a thorough hand washing. Prevention. The spread of this disease can, to a large degree, be prevented by following simple rules of Hygiene. 1. Personal Hygiene. This is most important, especially hygiene of the hands. Nails should be kept short, and the hands well washed with soap and nail brush, followed by a liberal rinsing under tap, after every visit to the toilet, and also after exposure to contamination in other ways, such as handling individuals and articles which are, or may be, infected. Hands should always be washed before handling food or food utensils. It is important that facilities for the above should be adequate in every house, and in places outside the home, such as restaurants and public conveniences. Special attention is necessary to children who may be unable themselves to carry out this washing routine. 2. Evironmental Hygiene. Mop down after use with a weak solution of disinfectant (white fluid) the W.C. Seat, the handle of flushing cistern and door knob. Chamber pots used by small children should be carefully cleansed and disinfected with a solution of not more than two teaspoonsful of 'black fluid' to one pint of water. The chamber pot should be wiped round with a damp cloth before use in order to remove any adherent disinfectant. Infants suffering from diarrhoea or dysentery should have frequent changes of napkins. Care should be taken in changing soiled napkins not to contaminate clothing. After removal, nappies should be steeped in 'white fluid' (not more than two teaspoonsful to one pint of water) for one hour before boiling. iii 3. Other Preventive Measures. (a) Food handlers in factories—restaurants, etc., will be put off work until certified free from infection by the Medical Officer of Health. Special arrangements have been made so that contacts of infected cases who are excluded from employment on the Medical Officer of Health's instructions can apply at the Health Department for a certificate to obtain National Health Insurance Benefit. (b) Infants attending nurseries will be excluded until certified free from infection by the Medical Officer of Health. (c) Infected school children and child contacts in the same family will be excluded from school until certified free from infection by the Medical Officer of Health." This leaflet is given to the contacts of all cases when Dysentery occurs in a house. The rehousing of families living in overcrowded conditions, and those handicapped by medical conditions, continues to be one of the major problems. The extreme shortage of appropriate facilities causes the provision of satisfactory alternative rehousing accommodation to be so slow as to fall far short of the demand. Almost as quickly as those already on the waiting lists obtain other accommodation, either from the L.C.C. or the Borough Council, new applicants replace them on the lists. This is shown clearly by the figures of 86 overcrowded families, comprising 415 persons, rehoused during the year; but 104 families of 449 persons were added to the overcrowding list during the same period. A comparison of the figures for cases of tuberculosis, and other medical grounds reveals a similar situation. The housing position generally has brought the public to realise that unless they can obtain a priority on the housing lists, they stand little or no chance of securing better accommodation. There is, therefore, a growing tendency for those seeking rehousing to strive to obtain from their general practitioners medical certificates as evidence of their claims for priority treatment. The Borough Council and especially the Housing Committee of the Council, are fully aware of this great shortage, hence their iv anxiety to clear away the old outmoded houses, and to replace them with modern homes as rapidly as possible. The aged people in the Borough occupy my mind very greatly, particularly when we hear rumours of certain of the personal health services being returned by the L.C.C. to the control of the Borough Councils. In the body of the report will be found Miss Morris' report on the work of the Voluntary Old People's Welfare Committee, which shows a general and progressive expansion. The Borough Council help in the only way they can help at present, by financial assistance, but I feel that if Local Authorities only had the power, very much good could be done in the preventive field for the old people at very little cost, and at great saving to the State in their maintenance in beds in the Chronic Wards of Hospitals. The work of the Department has been very heavy, and again shows a considerable increase in work accomplished. I must pay tribute to the Staff from the Chief Inspector downwards, for the hard work they have put in, and for their cooperation and loyalty. I also wish to place on record my appreciation to the Members of the Council for their tolerance and consideration given to me, and my best thanks to the Chief Officers and their Staffs for their willing help and co-operation. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, W. STOTT, Medical Officer of Health. PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE (As at December 31st, 1954). Chairman—J. J. SHEEN. Mayor—H. E. STILLMAN, J.P., L.C.C.

The 1953/54 decrease was widened to 1,500. After a decline in the birth rate for each of the last six years from 1948 this figure showed a slight increase in 1954. The fall in the death rate in 1953 after increases in the two previous years showed a further decrease in 1954. The infant death rate dropped to the 1950 level following a heavy increase in 1953, which was the highest figure since 1949. The death rate of illegitimate infants, which reached an abnormally high peak in 1953, showed a dramatic decline in 1954 to the lowest recorded for many years. Unfortunately, the still-birth rate continued to rise and reached the highest point since 1938.

Dysentery remained at about the same level as previously, and although there was a considerable increase in Bacterial Food Poisoning there was a compensating decrease in those of a toxic origin. The figures for Measles and Whooping Cough, which had previously increased, shewed a decline, particularly in Measles. Other decreases were in Poliomyelitis and Scarlet Fever. There were more cases of Ophthalmia Neonatorum and Scabies during the year, and again a heavy increase in Puerperal Pyrexia. Only 26 of the latter notifications, totalling 76, were Southwark residents, and except in one home confinement, the infection was developed in hospital subsequent to admission for confinement. IMMUNISATION There was an appreciable increase in Diphtheria and Whooping Cough Immunisation during 1954 for children over five, and for the "booster" injections. Immunisation Under 5 years of age Over 5 Diphtheria 148 65 Whooping Cough 85 1 Combined 1,164 22 "Booster" injections 203 737 1,600 825 Total 2,425 PUERPERAL PYREXIA (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS 1954 These Regulations amending the principal 1951 Regulations, came into operation on January 1st.

JOf 76 Pyrexia cases—50 were not Southwark residents. Admitted to Hospital for confinements. 9 TREATMENT AND BATHING CENTRE The numbers of male persons and school children requiring treatment at the Bathing Centre for vermin show a welcome decrease from last year's figures. There has been, however, a slight increase in the number of female cases. This increase is, no doubt, due to the establishment by the London County Council of the Centre at 96 Great Guildford Street, for the reception of women with no fixed way of living. The total of 808 treatments for Scabies during the year shows a considerable increase on last year's figure of 381. The increased incidence has been amongst women and school children. Adults requiring treatment for body and head vermin come mainly from lodging houses and hostels, but only 4 persons—2 males and 2 females—from such establishments have been treated for Scabies during the year. Disinfestation of premises against the usual types of house vermin has decreased, but treatment for other types of infestation shows an increase, largely due to a heavy moth infestation in some blocks of flats. One unusual infestation dealt with during the year was for Clover mites (Bryobia praetiosa), infesting ground floor flats from the garden. Others included the treatment of stored foodstuffs in a warehouse to prevent the spread of "Book lice," (Psocids), from infested sugar beet seeds, and the treatment of premises for an infestation of "Bacon beetles" (Dermestes lardarius). The figures for notified cases of Dysentery, mostly amongst Nursery and Primary school children, remain at about the same level as last year. At one school, however, the incidence of diarrhoea was so high that it was considered necessary to disinfect the whole school premises and disinfection was carried out during the Easter holiday period.

Fourteen intimation notices were served of which 11 have been complied with. OFFENSIVE TRADES There are four premises engaged in offensive trades in the Borough as follows:—Skin Dressers 2, Tripe Dresser 1, Manure Manufacturer 1. During 1954, 47 inspections were made. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 Seventeen applications were received during the year for registration under the Act, all of which were satisfactory. 311 Inspections were made during the year. WATER SUPPLY The domestic water supply of the Borough is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board, and has been satisfactory in quality and quantity. During the year, three complaints were received regarding the taste of water. Two of these were due to dirty storage tanks. In the third case, the Metropolitan Water Board was informed and a sample analysed, which was satisfactory. Public Health (London) Act, 1936 - Section 98 During the year 118 notifications of the withdrawal of water supply were received from the Metropolitan Water Board. 14 Public Health (London) Act, 1936 - Section 95 Certificates have been issued in respect of the provision of a proper and sufficient supply of water at 383 new dwellings as follows:— Block "E" Edison House, New Kent Road 20 flats.

The conditions generally were found to be quite satisfactory. There were no cases of default in sending lists of outworkers to the Council, nor was it necessary to serve any notices or institute any prosecutions for work carried on in unwholesome premises (Sec. 111).

There are 1,015 manholes and flushing tanks in the sewer system. Prior to actual treatment a test bait of 4 ounces of bread rusk was deposited in each manhole and subsequently checked. From this test bait, 689 manholes were found to show infestation by reason of the bait being eaten. Of these, 333 were complete ' 'takes'' indicating a fairly heavy infestation. The quarterly poison treatments were commenced within three weeks with the following results:— Complete "Takes." Fairly Heavy Slight No "Takes." Infestations. 1st Qtr. (16 oz. Poison baits) 4 433 38 208 2nd Qtr. (12 oz.) 1 124 232 322 3rd Qtr. (12 oz.) 1 48 182 443 4th Qtr. (12 oz.) — 65 194 420 These appear to be very successful and it is gratifying to note the absence of normal seasonal build-ups of rat population. This method of treatment is being continued. RENT & MORTGAGE INTEREST RESTRICTIONS ACTS, 1920-1939 Twenty four certificates as to the state of repair of dwelling houses were issued during the year under the above Acts. HOUSING REPAIRS AND RENTS ACT, 1954 The Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, which came into operation on the 30th August, 1954, provides amended powers for dealing with unfit houses. Duties are also placed upon the Council for dealing with certain matters in relation to rent increases permitted by the Act. Part I of the Act, which deals with slum clearance and the reconditioning of unfit houses, requires local authorities to submit to the Minister of Housing and Local Government proposals for dealing with unfit houses in their district. In London these proposals must be submitted jointly by the London County Council and the respective borough councils and must be in the hands of the Minister by the 30th August, 1955. This part of the Act empowers local authorities to acquire houses in clearance areas or subject to demolition orders and to carry out such works as are necessary to render them capable of providing accommodation adequate for the time being. Financial assistance in the acquisition and maintenance of such houses is to be provided by the Exchequer. 17 Part II of the Act, dealing with rent increases, places upon local authorities the duty of issuing certificates, on application, that houses of which it is proposed to increase the rent are not in good repair, and are not reasonably suitable for occupation, having regard to stability, freedom from dampness, natural lighting, ventilation, water supply, drainage and sanitary conveniences, and facilities for the storage preparation and cooking of food, and for the disposal of waste matter. Such houses will be inspected by the Sanitary Inspectors. 166 certificates were issued during the year under the above Act. RAG FLOCK & OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 During the year six samples were taken and submitted to the prescribed Analysts Mr. John Hudson, M.A., F.C.S., and Mr. G. Ginger, F.C.S., Chiltern Research Laboratories, Ltd., Marlow. All these samples complied with the requirements of the Regulations. Nine premises are registered for the use of filling materials, and one licensed for manufacture or storage of Rag Flock. WELL WATER The three private wells in the Borough are still in use for industrial purposes. The supply in each case is satisfactory. PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1936: PROPOSED AMENDMENT The Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee requested the London County Council to insert an appropriate clause in their next General Powers Bill to empower local authorities to require information as to ownership of properties to enable them to serve any notices under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. Local authorities already have similar powers in respect of notices served under the Housing Act 1936. POULTRY PLUCKING The London County Council proposed to make an order under Section 140(1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, declaring the business of poultry plucking to be an offensive business, but before doing so, asked the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee for their observations. The opinion of this Council was that, although poultry plucking was not at present carried on in Southwark as a main business, the making of such an order was desirable. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1954—HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS. This Act became law on 5th July, 1954, and gave effect to a suggestion made by this Council by providing for the registration of hairdressers and barbers (other than those visiting premises or 18 carrying on part-time businesses) and the making of by-laws relating to the cleanliness of premises, instruments, towels, etc., and of persons employed. The Council may by resolution fix the day on which registration shall be compulsory in this Borough (which must not be less than one month after public notice is given). LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1953: DISCHARGE OF TRADE EFFLUENTS INTO SEWERS Part II of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1953, relating to the discharge of trade effluents etc., into sewers came into operation on 1st April, 1954. Section 4 (2) of the Act provides that the "sewer authority" in relation to the discharge or proposed discharge of any trade effluent into the London sewerage system shall be the County Council or the local sewer authority (i.e. the City Corporation or the Metropolitan Borough Council) in whom is vested the sewer into which the effluent will first enter; but this provision is subject to the provisions of section 13, by which the local sewer authority may, with the agreement of the London County Council, authorise that Council to perform on its behalf any of its functions under sections 9 to 12 (relating to requests to traders for information, imposition of conditions with respect to discharge of trade effluents, agreements with traders and provision of inspection chambers at trade premises). Such an authorisation may be subject to such conditions as may be agreed between the two authorities. Although there are many trade effluents already draining direct to the County Council's main sewers, by far the largest proportion of the trade effluents in London drain first to local sewers. The London County Council were informed that it was not proposed to ask that they should perform any of this Council's functions in this respect. 19 ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. Mr. G. Stubbs, the Council's Smoke Abatement Officer, has submitted the following report:— The figures of deposited matter in the Bankside area were still high, though there was an over-all improvement compared to the previous year. The old Bankside Generating Station was again brought into use during peak periods, and must have contributed considerably to the general pollution. At Newington Lodge the London County Council has now installed coke-burning furnaces to replace the old coal-fired boilers which caused smoke and soot nuisance to local residents. This remedial action by the L.C.C. was promised following letters of complaint sent by the Borough Council. Several complaints were received of smoke emission from factory incinerators burning waste straw, wood chips and rubbish. Visits by the Inspector and instructions on the proper methods of operating the plants produced good results. Most of the other complaints of smoke, were due to new stokers or excessive demands on the boilers. In connection with the classes held at the Borough Polytechnic for stokers and boiler-house operatives, the Council sent a circular letter to all firms operating furnaces in Southwark seeking their support in encouraging staff to attend. As a further step, the employers were invited to a meeting at which there were short lectures and a discussion on boiler efficiency and smoke abatement. The Public Health Department staged a Health Exhibition in the Municipal Offices and the section devoted to atmospheric pollution proved very popular. The Council appointed representatives to the newly formed South East Division of the National Smoke Abatement Society. As in previous years the Council has in use two Standard Deposit Gauges, three Lead-Peroxide Instruments and one Smoke and Volumetric Sulphur-Dioxide Apparatus. The figures of the deposited matter as recorded on the sites in Walworth Road and Bankside are as follows:— 1954 Walworth Road Bankside January 19.6 75.5 tons per square mile. February 30.2 78.8 tons per square mile. March 25.2 32.4 tons per square mile. April 11.2 19.4 tons per square mile. May 26.6 31.2 tons per square mile. June 20.4 20.5 tons per square mile. July 11.7 77.0 tons per square mile. August 14.5 22.3 tons per square mile. September 18.8 31.9 tons per square mile. October 22.8 72.5 tons per square mile. November 21.6 56.7 tons per square mile. December 22.7 75.9 tons per square mile. During the year fifteen complaints were received regarding smoke emissions; 179 observations and inspections were made by the Inspector, and 8 Intimation Notices issued. 20 FACTORIES Eight hundred and ninety one inspections of Factories were made during the year, and 39 notices were served. There are now 1,026 factories of all types on the register, comprising 254 factories without mechanical power, 742 with mechanical power, and in addition 30 building sites, for which a further 40 inspections were made, and one notice served.

During the year 40 samples of ice-cream were taken with the following results:— 17 samples, Grade I. 11 samples, Grade II. 9 samples, Grade III. 3 samples, Grade IV. In addition: 26 samples were chemically examined for compliance with the prescribed standards of composition of ice-cream. Three of these samples did not contain the requisite amount of fat and the vendors were cautioned. Samples subsequently taken at the premises were satisfactory. Periodical inspections were made to all premises. A "Code of Standards" was sent to each new dealer and inspections were carried out before the registration of any new premises to ensure that they were satisfactory and all requirements fully understood. Copies of the Public Analyst's reports on samples taken were forwarded to the vendors concerned. In the case of Grade III 28 and IV samples, special investigations were made at the premises in an effort to detect some fault which may have caused the unsatisfactory gradings. DESIGNATED MILK During the year the following Licences were issued under the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949, and Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949. 1 Pasteuriser's Licence. 116 Dealers' Licences for Pasteurised Milk. 137 Dealers' Licences for Sterilised Milk. 88 Dealers' Licences for Tuberculin Tested Milk. Supplementary Licences. 18 Supplementary Licences for Pasteurised Milk. 18 Supplementary Licences for Sterilised Milk. 15 Supplementary Licences for Tuberculin Tested Milk. Forty-eight samples of Designated Milks were taken and submitted to the Public Analyst for examination. All these satisfied the prescribed tests. Twenty-eight samples of Pasteurised Milk supplied to local schools were also examined by the Public Analyst, and the London County Council informed of the results. MILK SELLERS At the close of the year there were 161 registered milk distributors in the Borough, whilst the number of distributors purveying milk in the Borough from registered premises elsewhere was 17. 294 inspections of Milkshops and Dairies were made during the year. PUBLIC HEALTH (CONDENSED MILK) REGULATIONS Eight samples of condensed milk were purchased for analysis under the above regulations. They were all certified by the Public Analyst to comply with the said regulations. MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATIONS) (PASTEURISED AND STERILISED MILK) (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS, 1953 On October 1st, 1954, it became compulsory to use caps or covers overlapping the lips of containers of pasteurised milk. From the same date, pasteurised milk must be put into the containers in which it is to be delivered to the consumer, at the premises where it is pasteurised. BAKEHOUSES At the end of the year there were 27 Bakehouses in use in Southwark, of which 7 were Basement Bakehouses. 115 inspections were made by the Inspector. ITALIAN PEARS On 20th September, 1954, information was received that a wagonload of Italian pears had arrived at Dover and were being officially "landed" and cleared at Southwark. The pears were inspected and found, on examination, to be contaminated with varying amounts of a white powder spread more or less evenly over the surface, and in order to arrange for samples 29 to be submitted to the Public Analyst, the consignment (758 cases of approximately 9 tons) was detained in accordance with the Public Health (Imported Foods) Regulations, 1937—1948. The Public Analyst certified as follows:— Two pears of average size and contamination were analysed with the following results:— Lead. Arsenic. (Parts per million) No. 1 6.5 6.5 No. 2 9.7 7.5 These pears could not be allowed to go to the retail trade, and as a result of immediate negotiation with the Importers it was found possible for the pears to be dealt with at a canning factory where facilities were available for proper cleansing before preparation for human consumption. A letter was sent to the Italian Embassy protesting against this consignment of pears, contaminated with lead arsenate, being allowed to leave Italy. The Commercial Counsellor at the Embassy replied, expressing regret at the occurrence and stating that the matter had been brought to the attention of the Italian Institute for Foreign Trade. It was felt that the action taken by the Institute, coupled with the loss, estimated at £300, sustained by the Italian shipper, constituted a powerful deterrent against a repetition. PUBLIC HEALTH (PRESERVATIVES IN FOOD) REGULATIONS 1925 48: THIOUREA The Ministry of Food, in Circular MF 2/54 drew attention to the use by certain orange growers of thiourea and of fungicides containing thiourea as a rot and mould suppressant. Thiourea can penetrate the skin of citrus fruits and find its way into the juice. Experiments in the United States of America have shown that this chemical is lethal to some animals in very low concentrations. Its use is accordingly open to strong objections on grounds of toxicity. Moreover, thiourea falls within the definition of "Preservative" contained in the Preservatives in Food Regulations and the sale of any articles of food containing thiourea would be a contravention of these Regulations since no provision exists therein permitting its addition to food. For this reason it would not be appropriate to introduce legislation designed specifically to prohibit the importation and sale of citrus fruit so treated. In consequence of this circular, samples of various brands of oranges were obtained from consignments landed in the borough, or from retailers. Thiourea was found to be present in five brands of Spanish oranges. The importers and the Ministry of Food (and through them, the growers in Spain) were immediately informed of this infringement of the Regulations. Undertakings were received from the importers that they would take immediate steps to prevent further imports of oranges so affected, and the matter was also referred to the Spanish Chamber of Commerce and export authorities. 30 PUBLIC HEALTH (MEAT) REGULATIONS, 1924 52 Circular MF 10/54 from the Ministry of Food dealt with a number of points and suggestions in connection with the slaughter of animals and the inspection of meat intended for sale for human consumption. The Circular refers to the recommencement of private slaughtering on 2nd July, 1954, and to the relevant requirements of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations and the powers of local authorities to inspect and seize meat by virtue of Section 10 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. The Ministry will no longer control the disposal of meat unfit for human consumption. It is, of course, an offence under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, Section 9, for any person to sell or have in his possession for sale, meat which is intended for but is unfit for human consumption, and meat and offal at slaughterhouses which is rejected by an authorised officer must be disposed of in a manner which does not oontravene the provisions of that Section. On the repeal of the Livestock (Restriction of Slaughtering) Order, 1947, the statutory obligation on occupiers of slaughterhouses to have meat which is unfit for human consumption stained before it leaves the premises, will lapse. It is hoped that the practice of staining such meat will continue as a voluntary measure. No slaughtering is carried on in this Borough. SLAUGHTERHOUSES There is only one licensed slaughterhouse in the Borough, which is not in use. Four inspections of the premises were made during the year to ensure that no slaughtering was in operation. FOOD AND DRUGS AMENDMENT ACT, 1954 This Act has received Royal Assent, but except for one section (dealing with the restriction of private slaughterhouses) will not come into operation until a date to be appointed by order of the Minister of Food. The Act deals with the composition and labelling of food, and precautions against danger to health in connection with the sale of food, but its detailed provisions are to be the subject of regulations. THE LABELLING OF FOOD (AMENDMENT) ORDER 1953 This Order which came into operation on 1st January, 1954: (а) permits the use of the description "Atholl Brose'' for a product consisting of malt whisky, oatmeal, honey and cream and containing not less than 25 per cent. proof spirit. (b) permits flour, National Flour and National Brown Flour to be sold without a declaration of ingredients in so far as they comply as regards composition with the requirements of the Flour Order 1953. (c) removes from Table C of the First Schedule to the principal Order specific reference to soft drinks, saccharin tablets and sweetening tablets which are now the subject of Standards Orders and therefore fall within the first item in Table C which is a Table of pre-packed foods of which the ingredients need not be specified on the label. 31 FOOD STANDARDS (MARGARINE) ORDER 1954 This Order which came into force on the 16th May, requires that vitamins A and D shall continue to be added to all margarine sold by retail. The required vitamin A content is increased and is roughly equivalent to that of butter, whilst the vitamin D content remains the same, apart from a tolerance of 10 per cent. as under control. The Order applies to all home produced and imported margarine sold by retail, except that used by a caterer for cooking or made up foods. CHIPPED AND CRACKED CROCKERY Proposals to make regulations under the Food and Drugs Amendment Bill relating to the use of chipped and cracked crockery in catering establishments have received careful consideration. It has been felt, however, that it would be both unreasonable and impracticable to insist that all crockery ahould be without cracks or otherwise undamaged, particularly as there was no conclusive evidence of any epidemic due to the use of such utensils. CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS There are 480 catering establishments in the Borough. These include riverside snack bars, cafes, coffee stalls, mobile snack bars, public house restaurants, and industrial canteens. All have received systematic inspection and close supervision during the year, and a satisfactory standard has been maintained. REGISTRATION OF FOOD PREMISES (Food and Drugs Act, 1938) During the year 88 premises were registered for the purpose of the Preparation or Manufacture of Sausages or Potted, Pressed, Pickled or Preserved Food intended for Sale. There was 1 registration of premises used for the purpose of Wholesale Dealing in Margarine and 1 registration of premises used for Butter Blending and Packeting.

WELFARE OF THE AGED Miss M. Morris, The Organising Secretary of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee, reports that there was expansion in every Branch of the Committee's work during the year. A total of nearly 45,000 meals were provided during the year. 20,747 meals were served in the Gate House Restaurant, and 3,724 in the Nelson Square Luncheon Club. The two Meals-on-Wheels vans of the Old People's Welfare Committee supplied 11,485 meals, and the two W.V.S. vans supplied 8,933. This total of 20,418 nearly doubled the 10,515 total of the previous year. All meals were cooked at the Gate House Restaurant. 1,697 chiropody treatments were given, nearly treble the previous year's 600. 35 The number who went on the organised seaside holiday increased from 60 to 150. There were many day outings to seaside, country and theatre for the able-bodied; and the Rotary Club of Southwark again arranged private car outings and parties for the frail, infirm and house-bound. Twice weekly Club Meetings at the Gate House provided music, games, lectures, debates and entertainments, some of which were given also in the evenings. The number of individual cases referred to Old People's Welfare Committee by hospitals, doctors and others rose to 1,063, and covered a great variety of problems. The home visiting of these people was carried out by the Organising Secretary and a small band of voluntary visitors. Sixty-seven new cases were dealt with by the Public Health Department during the year. A number of aged and infirm persons were regularly conveyed to the treatment and bathing station, bathed and returned home by our transport. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT Compulsory Removals. One person was removed to an Old People's Home under Section 47, and the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, which provides for the compulsory removal of persons in need of care and attention. Burial of the Dead. During the year the Council arranged for twelve burials under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, at a total cost of £100 5s. Od.
