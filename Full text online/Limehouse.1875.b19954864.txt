The footway, curb, and channel on the West side of Burges Street, Limehouse, have been relaid by arrangement with the Trustees of the Cotton Estate. SPECIAL PAVING. Rich Street, Spread Eagle Street, and Gill Street, Limehouse, were paved by order of the Board at a cost of £1,500, and application was made to the Metropolitan Board to advance the amount by way of Loan. The cost of the paving of the Commercial Road having amounted to ,£20,500, and the amount borrowed for the same being only <£18,000, there was consequently a deficiency of £2,500; a further application was made to the Metropolitan Board to advance that amount by way of Loan. The cost of Paving the new thoroughfare of Sun Tavern Gap. Shadwell, amounted to £1,500; application was made to the Metropolitan Board to advance that amount by way of Loan. The Board having ordered the following streets to be paved, at an estimated cost of £5,000, viz., Rhodeswell Road, Featherstone's Buildings, Copenhagen Place, Frederick Street, New Street, Church Row, part of Regent Street, and Park Street, Limehouse ; application was made to the Metropolitan Board to advance the amount by way of Loan. The above sums, amounting together to £10,500, have been advanced by the Metropolitan Board of Works for the purpose of defraying the expenses of the before-mentioned paving works, the loan to be repaid in 15 years by 15 equal annual instalments, and to bear interest, payable quarterly, at £3.. 18..6 per cent, per annum. LIGHTING. The number of Public Lamps in the District is 790, being an increase of 6 since Lady-day, 1875. PUBLIC URINALS. A new Urinal, with 10 compartments, has been erected in lieu of the old one, in the Commercial Road, at the junction of the East and West India Dock Roads. The Urinals are flushed and cleansed with water by men employed by the Board, and have been maintained in good order. CLEANSING & WATERING. The principal paved streets are cleansed daily, and the others not less than twice a week. During the past season the whole of the streets, &c., have been constantly watered by the Contractors with water from the East London Water Works, nominal consideration; and Messrs. Middleton were willing to give up their interests also for a nominal consideration, subject to the Board purchasing the interest of Mr. Haden, and Mr. Wood, in respect of Nos. 171 and 181, and giving possession to Messrs. Middleton of the surplus portions of the said premises not required for the Improvement. I was instructed to negociate with Mr. Haden, and Mr. Wood, for the purchase of their interests in the property, and ultimately terms were settled and the property conveyed to the Board at a cost of £3,800. The Metropolitan Board were applied to to contribute half the cost of the Improvement, which that Board has consented to do. The sum of £3,800 has been borrowed from the Metropolitan Board of Works for the purposes of this Improvement, to be repaid by equal annual instalments extending over a period of 54 years, and to bear interest payable quarterly at £2 18s. 6d. per cent, per annum. BILLS SN PARLIAMENT. In the Regent's Canal and Dock Bill a clause was inserted at the instance of the Thames Conservancy for the construction by the Canal Company of two Landing places in lieu of those known as Kidney Stairs, and Duke Shore Stairs. Numerous clauses were also inserted at the instance of this Board for the protection of the interests of the Board and the District. A requisition was made by the promoters as to certain concessions they required to be made for the formation of Tramways across Fore Street and Narrow Street, and also Tunnels under, and Bridges over, the same streets. The requisition was granted by the Board upon certain conditions, and an agreement was entered into between the Board and the Promoters lor carrying the same into effect. ADDITIONS TO LABORATORY. The Analyst having brought under the consideration of the Board the necessity for an addition being made to the Laboratory, so that certain delicate parts of the apparatus used might be kept distinct, pursuant to the direction of the Board, I prepared a plan shewing the addition required, and the Board approved the same, and ordered the work to be done, and the same has been carried out by Mr. Stuttle, at a cost of £59 8s. 9d., as per Contract entered into with him. HIGH TIDES. A communication having been received from the Metropolitan Board with reference to the intention of that Board to apply to Parliament for power to require Vestries and District Boards and Owners of Property abutting upon the River to make proper walls and fences for protection from floods, a letter was addressed by order of this Board to the Metropolitan Board of Works, informing them that in the opinion of this Board power should be obtained to compel owners of wharves on the side of the River to raise them sufficiently high to keep out the tide, and also calling their attention to the fact that no provision now exists for the purpose. 'I he Board referred the matter to the Works Committee, to watch the progress of the Bill, with a view to clauses being inserted therein for giving the Local Authorities power to carry out the works. The Works Committee of your Board appointed a Deputation to attend before the Parliamentary Committee of the Metropolitan Board of Works upon the subject, when the views ot this Boaid upon the whole question were laid before such Committee bj the Officers of your Board, and a promise was given that the mat cr should receive due and careful consideration. PROPOSED TUNNEL UNDER THAMES. The attention of the Board having been called to the proposal before the Metropolitan Board of Works for the making of a Tunnel from the East India Dock Road under the River Thames to Greenwich, and thus provide a communication between the North and South sides of the Thames, a Memorial was presented to the Metropolitan Board of Works by direction of this Board, urging upon them the desirability of carrying out the proposed scheme. NEW BRIDGE & PLATFORMS AT STEPNEY STATION. The works in connection with the construction of the new Bridge across the Commercial Road, and Platforms across York Street East and York Road are proceeding satisfactorily. The plans of the new Bridge and Works have been submitted to, and received the approval of, the Board. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, CHARLES DUNCH, Surveyor of the Board. BOARD OF WORKS for the LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. ■ ■ «■ • REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER of HEALTH for V the year 1875. to the BOARD OF WORKS for the LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honor to submit to you my Report on the sanitary condition of your District during the year 1875. In that period there were registered in the District 2,167 births, and 1,341 deaths. From this number of deaths there must be deducted 27, the number of deaths of non-residents in the District "which occurred in the East London Hospital for Children; and to the remainder (1,314) must be added 204, the number of deaths of residents in the District which occurred in Institutions outside it; we therefore obtain a total of 1,518 deaths as representing the total mortality in the Limehouse District during the year. 5- 2 The following Table shows the population, the number of inhabited houses, and the number of births, deaths, and marriages in the year 1875, and 10 years preceding Population estimated at the middle of the year 1875. 58,659 No. of Inhabited Houses in District.

Population at Census 1871, 57,690, 2. Area in acres, 576. 3. Average No. of Persons in each house atCensus 1871, 7.5. As shown by the above Table, the average number of persons in each house at the census in 1871 was 7.5. I have no reason to suppose that these figures do not represent the average number of persons in each house in 1875. The population of the District I estimate at 58,659, which number, allowing 7.5 persons to each house, Avould indicate that there is in the District 7,820 inhabited houses: this number agrees closely with the figures of a return recently made to me. It thus appears that your District, the area of which is 576 acres, has a population of 58,659 persons, who inhabit 7,820 houses, which numbers give an average of about 100 3 persons to an acre, and 7.5 persons to a house. Of the 2,167 Births, 1,251 were registered in Limehouse, 571 in Ratcliff, and 345 in Shad well and Wapping. It was the largest number of births registered in any of the last ten years. Of the 1,518 deaths 716 occurred in Limehouse, 355 in Ratcliff, 243 in Shadwell & Wapping, 200 in the Sick Asylum at Bromley, and 4 in the Fever Hospital. It was the largest number of deaths registered in any year since 1866, when the number was 1,852. The births and deaths were above, and the marriages below, the average of the last ten years. Permit me now to draw your attention to the following Table, which exhibits the Annual Birth Rate, the Rate of Mortality, Death Rates among Children, and Deaths in Public Institutions for the year 1875, and 6 years preceding:— Birth Rate per 1,000 of the Population. Annual Rate 01 Mortality, per 1,ooo living. Deaths of Children under 1 year ; per centage of total Deaths. Per centage of deaths of Children under i year to Registered Births. Deaths of Children under 5 years : per centage of Total Deaths. Total Number of Deaths in Public Institutions. 1875 37 25.8 28 19 47 204 1869 32 25 28 22 57 —190 approx 1870 35 21 28 17 50 190 1871 34 21 26 16 48 190 1872 35 19 29 15 52 190 1873 36 23 27 19 50 200 1874 36 21 25 16 46 176 Average of 6 years. 1869—1874 34.7 21.7 27 17.5 50.5 189 Upon examination of this Table, we shall see that the birth rate in 1875 was higher than it had been for some years, and that it exceeded the average of the last six years by over 2 per 1,000; that the death rate was also high, and exceeded the average of the last 4 six years by 4 per 1,000; that the per centage of deaths of children under one year to the total deaths was likewise above the average, as was the per centage of deaths of children under one year to the registered births; that the per centage of deaths of children under five years to the total deaths was 47, being less than the average of the last six years; and that the total number of deaths in public institutions was somewhat above the average. For detailed information regarding the causes of the mortality in the District, I beg to refer you to Table IV. in the Appendix. By referring to it you will find that of 1,314 deaths, 724—or more than one-half—were those of children under five years of age. Zymotic diseases, viz., Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, and Diarrhoea, killed 242 of such children, the total deaths from these causes during the year having been 287. Ninety-two deaths of children under 5 were attributed to diseases of a constitutional character, such as Consumption and Hydrocephalus, the total deaths from such causes having been 233. Two hundred and seventythree deaths, out of a total of 581 from Local Diseases, were those of children under five years of age; and of 152 deaths from Developmental Diseases, 100 were those of children of a similar age. We here again encounter that great infant mortality, which it is my duty to bring to your notice year after year, and which, in my opinion, should be very much reduced. Of course improved dwellings and prosperous times would aid materially in bringing about a reduction in the infant and general death rate, but I regard the dissemination of sanitary knowledge among the people as indispensable to such a result. How is this to be effected ? There is no doubt that the various 5 Nuisance Authorities, by their officers, do much to diffuse sanitary knowledge, but this is not sufficient. I should regard the teaching of at least the rudiments of the science in every school, public or private,, as a means well calculated to aid in bringing about the desired result. Exhibitions or Scholarships might be established ; lectures might be given ; and by various means which will suggest themselves to the thoughtful on such subjects, sanitary knowledge would become common among us. to our great benefit. The following Table shows the mortality from certain classes of diseases, and proportions to population, and to 1,000 deaths in the year 1875:— Total Deaths. Deaths per 1,000 of Population. Proportion of Deaths to 1,000 Deaths. 1. Seven Principal Zymotic Diseases 240 4.3 157 2. Pulmonary Diseases (other than Phthisis) 301 5.2 198 3. Tubercular Diseases 188 3.2 124 4. Wasting Diseases of Infants 124 2.1 81 5. Convulsive Diseases of Infants 168 2.9 110 NOTES. 1. Includes Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria Whooping Cough, Fever, and Diarrhoea. 3. Includes Phthisis, Scrofula, Rickets, and Tabes. 4. Includes Marasmus, Atrophy, Debility, want of Breast Milk, and Premature Birth. 5. Includes Hydrocephalus, Infantile Meningitis, Convulsions, and Teething. 6 From this Table it appears that 240 deaths were registered from the seven principal Zymotic diseases, that four persons out of every 1,000 of the population died from them, and that of every 1,000 deaths registered in the District during the year, 157 were occasioned by diseases of that class. We find also that 301 deaths were due to Pulmonary diseases (Phthisis excepted), that five of every 1,000 persons living died of such diseases, and that of every 1,000 deaths 198 were produced by them. Tubercular diseases killed 188 persons during the year : diseases of this class were fatal to 3 in every 1,000 of the population, and of every 1,000 deaths 124 were due to them. One hundred and twenty-four is the number of deaths registered from Wasting Diseases of Infants: this number indicates that diseases of this class killed 2 in every 1,000 persons living, and that of 1,000 deaths 81 were the result of such diseases. Convulsive Diseases of Infants caused 168 deaths; they were fatal to 3 in every 1,000 of the population, and of every 1,000 deaths 110 were due to them. The next Table shows the number of deaths from the seven principal Zymotic diseases in the six years 1869 to 1874, and in the year 1875:— Disease. 1869 1870 1871 1872 1873 1874 Annual Average of 6 years. 1869-1874 Proportion of Deaths to 1000 Deaths in 6 years 1869-1874 1875 Proportion of Deaths to 1000 Deaths in 1875. Smallpox 29 34 110 8 3 0 30 23 0 0 Measles 27 12 30 40 65 36 35 27 20 13 Scarlet Fever 152 43 18 19 19 105 59 46 48 31 Diphtheria 9 4 4 2 4 4 4.5 3.5 1 .6 Whooping Cough. 89 44 47 49 70 30 55 42 79 52 Fever 12 21 18 13 19 26 18 14 15 10 Diarrhœa 65 73 67 64 85 45 66.5 51 / 77 50 Total 383 231 294 195 265 246 268.0 206.5 240 156.6 7 From it we shall find that the mortality from Small Pox gradually increased from 29 in the year 1869 to 110 in the year 1871. In the following year there were but eight deaths from it, while for the last two years no death has been registered from this loathsome disease. Measles was not so fatal as it had been for the last four years, only twenty deaths having been registered from it. Scarlet Fever, too, was much less fatal than in 1874, fortyeight deaths being the number in 1875, while 105 deaths were registered in 1874. hooping Cough appears to have caused a greater mortality than in any year since 1869, no less than 79 deaths from it having been registered in the period under consideration. Fever does not appear to have been particularly fatal, the deaths from this disease having been 15—a little more than half the number that occurred in 1874. Diarrhœa caused 77 deaths, a greater number than has been registered during any of the last six years, except 1873, when that disease was the cause of eighty-five deaths. As usual Diarrhoea was fatal principally to the very young, 72 of the 77 deaths having been those of children under five years of age. Taking the number of deaths from the seven principal Zymotic diseases in the year as a crude test of the health of the population of any given area, I am of opinion that the public health of your District during the year 1875 was of a satisfactory character, inasmuch as the deaths from the seven principal Zymotic diseases in that year were considerably under the average of the last six years. 8 Sanitary Work. The year 1875 will be memorable in Sanitary annals as having been the year in which was passed that important piece of legislation—the Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act: that some such action was needed no one can doubt, previous Acts bearing on the subject, though excellent in theory, were found to be too intricate and cumbrous in practice. So far as one can see, this objection does not apply to the new Act. It appears to me to deal with the subject of the improvement of the dwellings of the poor in a comprehensive and broad manner, attacking unhealthy areas rather than single buildings (which can be treated more successfully by some of the other Sanitary Acts), and thus enabling the authority to clear away the numerous plague spots which exist in the Metropolis. As regards its action in this District, I must point to the extreme corner of Wapping, where that parish joins Aldgate, as the spot where I deemed it my duty to first exert the power given to me by the Act. The area, though not large, contained abominations sufficient for an area three times its size. Here were crowded houses, built no one knows when, how they stood was a marvel; their walls bulged, their floors sank, an indescribable musty odour pervaded tliem, water supply, drainage, closets, all were bad, and in my opinion nothing could remedy such a state of things short of pulling down the rickety dwellings. I made my representation accordingly to the Metropolitan Board, and in due course appeared before the Commissioner appointed by the Secretary of State to receive evidence, and hear objections. The evidence was indisputable, the objections futile; 9 the Commissioner reported favourably as to the putting in force of the Act in the locality; the Secretary of State approved of the plan submitted by the Metropolitan Board; the necessary Act of Parliament will be applied for and I hope passed; and one unhealthy area the less will exist in your District. An important addition to our Sanitary appliances has been made daring the year. I allude to the Disinfecting Apparatus. The necessity for the more efficient disinfection of bedding and clothing had long been apparent; and with a view to recommend to the Board what I considered the most effectual method of dealing with the question, I made enquiries regarding different disinfectors in various quarters. For efficiency and cleanliness none appeared to me to equal Leoni's patent, and I reported accordingly. Instructions were given by your Board forthwith to Messrs. Leoni & Co. to erect a disinfecting apparatus in premises belonging to the Board in Ratcliff, and about Easter the work was completed. A covered hand truck for the conveyance of infected articles was built by Messrs. Robinson & Napton, and two men were instructed in the method of using the apparatus. The opinion I formed of it has been justified by my experience of its working. It is economical, cleanly, and efficient. For a detailed account of the routine Sanitary work performed, such as disinfecting houses after contagious diseases, cleansing dirty houses, providing dust receptacles, water supply, and so forth, I beg to refer you to Table V. in the Appendix. 10 Cow Sheds. The owners of these premises in the District having given notice to your Board that it was their intention to apply for a renewal of their licenses, I was instructed to inspect and report upon the condition of these places. This having been done, notices were served upon the owners to remedy the defects reported, and the terms of these notices having been complied with, the licenses were renewed by the Justices. It was thought advisable, however, to oppose applications for licenses to two new premises on the ground of general unfitness for the purpose for which they were to be used. In neither case was a license obtained. Slaughter Houses. As you are aware, the Metropolitan Board of Works, by virtue of their authority, drew up bye-laws for the regulation of these places. In many cases it was found that these bye-laws could not be complied with; in other cases compliance would have necessitated extensive structural alterations, which owners were disinclined to undertake. In consequence the renewal of licenses to many of these buildings was opposed successfully, and there is now a great reduction in the number of such premises in the District. Adulteration of Food Act During the year 81 samples of food and drink were examined, viz., 12 of vinegar, 3 of cocoa, 8 of bread, 28 of milk, 1 of coffee, 10 of pepper, 13 of mustard, 4 of arrowroot, and 2 of flour. 11 Of these all the vinegars contained sulphuric acid, though not in a larger quantity than is allowed by law, viz., 1 part in 1,000. All the cocoas were genuine. Of the eight breads 7 contained no alum, the eighth contained a small quantity. Of the milks twenty-two were pure, and six were adulterated with water. The coffee contained a small quantity of chicory. Of the peppers all were genuine. Of the mustards three were mixed with flour, and coloured with turmeric. Of the arrowroots two consisted entirely of potato starch. Both the flours were genuine.
