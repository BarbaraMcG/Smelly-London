Metropolis Local Management Act. BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. SAVIOUR'S DISTRICT. THE NINTH ANNUAL REPORT. LONDON: PRINTED BY ASH & FLINT, LONDON BRIDGE, S.E. MD000LXV. THE NINTH ANNUAL REPORT, of the St. Sabiour's District Board of Works. RESPECTFULLY PRESENTED TO THE INHABITANTS. The Board of Works for the St. Saviour's District, pursuant to the 198 sect. of the Metropolis Local Management Act, submit their Ninth Annual Report and Abstract of Accounts to the Inhabitants of the District ; showing the Receipts and Expenditure of the Board for the twelve months ending on the 25th March. Annexed also are the Annual Reports of their Medical Officer and Surveyor. Appended to the Medical Officer's Report are statistical Tables, showing the state of health in the District, and setting forth the more important matters in connection with the sanitary condition of : the District which have engaged his attention and that of the Inspector during the past year. From these last it will be seen that numerous visits have been made, resulting in many instances in useful sanitary works, and that matters affecting the public health have engaged the vigilant attention of the Board and their Officers. The Surveyor's Report contains the usual details of works performed in his department, and of the materials used. The proceedings of the Board up to the 24th of June, the date of this Report, may bo epitomised as under:— In the month of November last the Board determined upon the removal of the Wellington Clock Tower, at the foot of London Bridge, on account of the obstruction it occasioned to the traffic, and steps were shortly afterwards taken for the removal of the Clock and obtaining possession of the portion of the Tower occupied by the London District Telegraph Company ; and advertisements were issued with a view to disposing of the materials. But, subsequently 4 to these proceedings, the Board bearing in mind the fact that a new park was about to bo formed in Bermondsey and Rotherhithe, and thinking that the Tower might with advantage bo re-erected in such park, and thus be preserved in the vicinity of Southwark, offered the same to the Metropolitan Board for their gratuitous acceptance, on condition of their so re-erecting the same, and that Board readily agreed to accept it, and undertook to remove and re-erect it at their own expense. It is in contemplation to provide, upon the removal of the Tower, a suitable Sanctuary and Lamp Column near the site, for the accommodation of the public. The Board, in the latter part of last year, seeing that considerable progress was being made in building operations in Southwark Street, and that a large amount of valuable property was being rapidly accumulated in the new buildings, put themselves in communication with the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company, and requested them to provide water mains and a supply of water as a precautionary measure in case of fire. The Board further requested that such mains might be laid in the subway, but the Company positively declined to avail themselves of the subway, and therefore the mains will have to be laid in the usual manner. The Metropolitan Board have handed over the charge and responsibility of lighting and maintaining the two ornamental lamp columns erected by them at the sanctuaries at each end of Southwark Street to the District Board. The Board have thought it desirable to appoint a Clerk of the Works, whose name and address will bo found in the List of Officers at page 32. During the recent Session of Parliament the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company introduced a Bill into Parliament for the widening and extension of their line, thereby seeking, inter alia, the entire closing of Holland Street, and the vesting of the site of a portion thereof in the Company. Immediately upon the introduction of the Bill the Board, foreseeing the great injury that would be inflicted upon the inhabitants of the District and others in the event of the Bill passing, took measures to oppose the same, and employed counsel to appear for them before the Committee of the House of Commons, but were unsuccessful in their opposition in that House. Afterwards, in consequence of the urgent requisition of numerous inhabitants of the District, they also opposed the Bill in the House of Lords, and were assisted by the co-operation of the Metropolitan Board of Works and a number of private inhabitants, but their joint opposition did not avail to prevent the closing of the street. The Board, however, have obtained the insertion of a clause stipulating for the formation of a subway for foot passegers from Holland 5 Street under the station into the Blackfriars Road, and an alteration in another clause, whereby Green Walk will be made 50 feet wide instead of 45 feet. The Contracts for cleansing and dusting the parish of Christchurch and Clink Liberty having expired, the Board, on the 1st instant, entered into fresh Contracts, which, as to dusting, are on far more favourable terms. The Metropolitan Board have contributed £150 towards expenses incurred in removing the House, No. 1, Broad wall, referred to in the last Annual Report. The Board finding the Board Room and Offices in Emerson Street inconvenient, have determined to render the same more suitable and commodious, and with that view have entered into a contract for considerable alterations and improvements, which are now being carried out according to the designs and under the directions of Mr. Franklin, architect and surveyor; meanwhile, the trustees of the Borough Market have kindly placed their new board room and offices at the service of the Board. The new works are to be completed by the 31st of August for £970 net, but this contract price docs not include repairs that are indispensably necessary to the old portion of the Building. During the past year the Board have presented petitions and memorials as under, viz.: to Parliament, respecting the sewage on the north side of the Thames, praying for further inquiry before disposing of it: in opposition to the Justices of the Peace Procedure Bill : in opposition to the Metropolitan Toll Bridges Bill, as regarded the proposed extra rating of St. Saviour's: to the Metropolitan Board, requesting them to oppose the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company's Bill (No. 1) seeking, inter alia, the closing of Holland Street: to the same Board, against the proposed vote of gratuities to their engineers: and to the House of Lords in opposition to the said Railway Bill. A List of Contracts in force on the 25th of March, and other particulars will bo found at the end. HERBERT STURMY, Clerk.

Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, The mortality of London, during the past year, was considerably in excess of the average of the four and twenty years preceding. The rate of mortality for the complete year was 2.645 per cent. of the population. This was exceeded in 1847—the Influenza year—and in the two Cholera years 1849 and 1854. But the average of 25 years, which include those epidemic periods, was only 2.482, which gives for 1864 an excess of more than two deaths per thousand beyond the average of the last quarter of a century. As this increase of mortality does not appear to have been confined to any particular districts, it may bo legitimately attributed to the long continuance of cold weather. In seven months of the year the mean temperature was below the average of the 23 years preceding, and in only two out of the remaining live was it slightly above it. Small Pox proved fatal in 2,012 cases in 1868, and in only 537 last year; and Scarlet Fever, which rose to 5,075 deaths in 1863, was fatal in only 8,242 instances in 1864. The prevailing epidemics were Measles, Whooping Cough, Typhus, and Diarrhoea. From the statistical tables I have the honor to submit for your inspection, you will observe, that the same causes which have raised the death rate of London have also increased the mortality of the Saint Saviour's District; and therefore, although the result is unfavorable compared with the previous year, it is not to any large extent attributable to local causes. Taking the population of 1861 as the basis of calculation, the per centage of deaths in your district contrasts very favorably with the rest of London ; and although the population of the Metropolis has probably increased in greater proportion than that of Saint Saviour, it may fairly be concluded, that if it were possible to base a calculation upon a corrected census, your district would still admit of favorable comparison. During the nine years this Board has been in existence, the number of deaths have been respectively 868, 920, 1,047, 996, 929, 1,066, 918, 828, and 891. The mortality of 1864 is therefore 63 in excess of the year preceding, but less by 49 than the average of the nine years. In London, the South Districts, and the district of Saint Saviour, the deaths from Epidemics have been respectively about one-fifth the of whole mortality ; and it is interesting to observe, 9 that the same increase and diminution of specific Zymotic diseases prevailed in every part of London. Measles, Typhus, and Diarrhoea, were more prevalent last year than in 1863, but Small Pox and Scarlet Fever less so. In Saint Saviour's District there was only one fatal case of Small Pox recorded, against fifteen in the year preceding. Twenty-nine persons died in the District during the year whose united ages amounted to 2,450 years, being an average of nearly 85 years each. Of these, two died at the advanced age of 89 and one at 90 years. In the Workhouse here were 124 deaths during the year. The mortality occurred chiefly in the severe weather of the early part of the year ; of this number fifty-nine were between the ages of 60 and 80, and fifteen above 80 years old. Nearly two-thirds therefore of those who died in the Workhouse were above 60 years, and the number above 80 exceeded the mortality of the whole District at that advanced age. The largo number of deaths in the Workhouse is attributable to the fact, that the out-door poor very generally entertain the opinion that the new building is an Infirmary for the district, rather than a convenient place of separation for the sick poor of the Workhouse. Application for admission to this Infirmary is not unfrequently made by persons who express the utmost surprise when they are informed that their object can only be attained by an admission into the Workhouse. The Hospital authorities are becoming more and more exclusive, and Workhouse Infirmaries are to a large extent supplying their place. With about two-thirds of the number of inmates of former years, the Saint Saviour's Workhouse contains at present nearly double the number of sick cases. There were thirty-four Coronor's Inquests held in the District during the year, and ten in Guy's Hospital. These represent fortyfive deaths from sudden, accidental, or violent causes. Ten of the eighteen deaths in the Hospital were the result of fire, and five in the District are attributable to Asphyxia. A large proportion of these cases arise from parental negligence—more than 300 Infants being annually suffocated by their parents in London alone. 1,107 Births were Registered during the year, giving an excess of 210 births over deaths. Notwithstanding an increase in the number of deaths from causes which are supposed to be more especially under human control, it will be observed, from the Table of sanitary work done, that more than ordinary exertions have been made to prevent the spread of disease. Upwards of nine hundred visits have been made in different parts of the district; three hundred and ninety houses inspected; two hundred and sixty-one notices to remove nuisances 10 issued; eleven houses ventilated ; twenty-nine cesspools emptied and drained ; eighty-six privies cleansed and repaired ; one hundred and forty-seven houses limewashed, and disinfectants plentifully applied to urinals, gullies, and wherever else required. Seventeen slaughter-houses, ten cow-houses, and twenty-nino bakehouses have also been regularly inspected. These statistics represent a large amount of labour, especially on the part of your Inspector, and it may be fairly presumed that disease has thus been in some measure prevented, and death robbed of his spoils. The most urgent wants of the District, however, are not those which are in the power of this Board to supply. What the laboring poor require is more room, and more water. There are families in the District paying 2s. 6d. weekly as rent for single ill-ventilated back rooms, whose area docs not exceed 9 feet by 8. In such cases it is useless to dilate upon the benefits and comfort of cleanliness. Where a family has to wash, cook, work, sleep, and perform all domestic duties in so small a compass, cleanliness involves a larger amount of labor than they who are more comfortably situated generally suppose. They who have to toil all day to procure the day's food, have but little heart to add labor which, to bo effectual, requires to be so often repeated. What the laboring poor in a neighbourhood like this require, is at least two rooms, at a rent proportionate to their wages. The man with 2s. 6d. or 8s. a day cannot afford half that amount for house accommodation alone. Only those whose occupation gives them experience can fully understand the difficulty the poorer classes, with large families, undergo in procuring a shelter of any kind. Where the demand is pressing, children are objected to, and thus, those who require the best accommodation are from the necessity of their position, compelled to accept the worst. This over-crowding is one of the most formidable difficulties your Board has to contend with, and it is not easy to discover a remedy. The poor themselves consider they are oppressed by the rich, who, to make money by railways, relentlessly deprive them of the comforts of their homes, and thus, compel them to reside at a distance from their work, or submit to an exorbitant price for inferior and unhealthy accommodation. It is also found in many parts of the District, that the water supply is insufficient; in some localities one tap is made to serve several houses. The water is turned on for a short period of the day, and the surrounding inhabitants have, within a very limited time, to store up what they require in pots, pans, tubs, pails, or any other utensils they may possess. In addition to the inconvenience of this system, it is stated, that the supply is exceedingly irregular. It will be readily believed that such a state of things is deleterious to health, and if, in addition to over-crowded rooms, the poor are stinted in the supply of that which is most essential to cleanliness, it 11 an excite no surprise that disease and death are the result. Unclean and intemperate habits among the poor are still most fruitful sources of disease, and although it appears almost impossible to eradicate these, yet it is frequently easy to remove hindrances to the cultivaion of the opposite virtues. The want of a comfortable and clean come is, in most instances, the origin of intemperance, and its concequences, neglect, poverty, and disease. For the existence of these habits the poor are far from excusable, but while human nature remains what it is, the good of the commonwealth or the ultimate food of the individual will be found to be insufficient with the gnoraut, as motives to self restraint, cleanliness, temperance and order. Show them some present good, and the old may be weaned rom pernicious and degrading practices, and the young kept true to hat path, which it is to be hoped all propose to keep when they tart on the journey of life. I have thought it desirable to dwell on this subject longer than nay be considered necessary, as I have a very strong conviction of the magnitude of the evil, and the comparatively small amount of attention it commands. To some extent, it may be true that this ???tate of things is exceptional and transitory, and will eventually right ???tself. Whether that may be the case or not, it is gratifying to those whose duty it is to watch over the health of the people, to observe, chat the tendency of recent legislation is to give greater freedom to the poor, and there can be little doubt that the law of settlement, which mas hitherto fixed the helpless to one spot, will ere long be abolished, and thus leave them to go wherever their interest or health may incline them. It is now, for the ninth time, my pleasing duty to thank the Board and its Officers for their kind assistance and co-operation in all my attempts to discharge the duties of the office entrusted to me. I am, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ROBERT BIANCHI. 12 PARISH OF CHRISTCHURCH— Population at Census, 1861, 17,030.
