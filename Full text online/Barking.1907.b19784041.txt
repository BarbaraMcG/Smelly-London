To the Chairman and Members of the Barking Town Urban District Council. Gentlemen, The population of the Urban District of Barking Town, estimated up to the middle of the year 1907, was 29,500 persons. This compared with the population as per census of 1901 gives an increase of 7,973. The number of occupied houses at the end of 1907 was 5,434, and the number of empties 218, leaving the nett number of inhabited houses as 5,216. The alterations at the Railway Station, including the approaches thereto, account for a loss of 144 houses, representing a disturbance of 806 persons. The basis of my calculation is the figure established at the last general census of 5.6 persons per inhabited house. 6 The number of inhabited houses in March, 1901 (census), was 3,851, which shews therefore an increase of 1,385 houses. Natural Increase of Population. Deaths. Births. Increase. 1900 398 783 385 1901 383 799 416 1902 336 817 481 1903 357 856 499 1904 385 896 511 1905 397 900 503 1906 360 873 513 1907 320 868 548 It seems to me that since 1900 the steady increase in the natural increase of the population is worthy of remark. In 1900 the nett gain was 385, in 1906 513, and in 1907 548. Water Supply. I insert a recent analysis of the water supply of the town. The water is supplied by the South Essex Water Company. DATA.

No case of disease arising from contaminated water has been detected during the year. We are still doing all we can to get the water for domestic use from the main, instead of passing through storage cisterns which so easily become foul. No house should be erected without this provision. Many houses during the year have been provided with clean fresh water in this way. The cottages at Creeksmouth have been connected with the public water supply, so that very few houses in the district now remain disconnected. I append the list here:— Property. Source and Condition. Two Cottages adjoining Longbridge Farm Shallow well. Bush Grove Farm „ Parsloes Lodge „ Scratton's Farm „ Starling's Hall „ Nos. 1, 2, 3, Lodge Lane „ Lodge Farm House „ Cottage adjoining „ Parsloe's Farm House „ Two Cottages in Gale Street „ Great Porters „ Mogg's Farm „ Nos. 1 to 6, Ripple Hall Cottages „ Alpha Cottage „ 9 Magazine Cottage No supply. De Pass' Cottages „ Magazine Cottage, Ripple Marsh „ Greatfields Farm House Main Public Supply. Two Cottages adjoining „ Davey's Tar Works (Cottage) No supply. Food Supply. The meat sold in the town has been found to be of good, wholesome quality, except in a few instances, but even then I could not pronounce it unfit for food. Vegetables have been good, and not dear, but are not used as much as they should be. In this connection, as I have pointed out before, the encouragement of small holdings with the establishment of a retail market for the disposal of the produce would, I am sure, work well. No food has been seized as unfit for use during the year. Milk Supply. This matter has not, owing to the cooler weather, been as much to the front as in former years. As will be seen from the annexed tables only three cowsheds remain in the district, and though a great deal remains yet to bring the methods adopted therein up-to-date, yet I do think substantial progress has been 10 made in this direction. The great thing is how to get the milk from the cow to the consumer without undue pollution. Of course, the first point of contamination is in the cowshed. The chief difficulties in connection with contamination here are: 1. Dirtiness of udders, teats, and flanks of the cows. 2. Want of cleanliness of vessels, churns, etc. 3. The necessity for covering the vessels when full, and cooling forthwith. 4. Cleanliness of cooler. I have done my best to get these items attended to, but most dairymen look upon it all as fads and theories of the Medical Officer and as a sort of persecution which adds to the expense of production, and until the public are alive to the necessity for clean milk and are prepared to pay for it, I fear little will be accomplished. Then there is the contamination in retailing, and lastly in the consumer's house—open milk jugs exposed to all kinds of contamination, flies, etc.—so that dirty milk is not all the cowkeeper's fault, but has to be apportioned between the producer, the retailer, and the consumer. To my mind the only method of any value is: (a) Milk produced clean. (b) Bottled clean. (c) Kept in the bottle until used. Of course this means a little more expense, which will be readily paid I think when the public become educated up to realizing the absolute necessity for it. COWSHEDS IN THE DISTRICT.

These have been inspected during the year, and the regulations adopted by the Council under the Factory and Workshops Act enforced. These regulations relate to:— (a) Overcrowding. (b) Ventilation. (c) Light. (d) Communication with bedroom. (e) Communication with w.c, ashpit, or privy. (f) Cleanliness and whitewashing. (g) Drain openings. (h) Water supply. There are no underground bakehouses in the district for which certificates of suitability have been given. There were several in occupation on January 1st, 1904, and as the requirements of the Council were not carried out they were all closed. Slaughter Houses. Two registered slaughter houses now remain, and one of these will probably be closed shortly. There is no regular supervision of the animals killed in these places. The only supervision is in respect of the cleanliness and suitability or otherwise of the premises. This is a great defect in our Sanitary administration, 15 The licensed house is in good order. Knacker's Yard, Creeksmouth.— This has been systematically and frequently inspected during the year, and generally has been found in fairly good order. Rivers and Streams of District. Several times during the year the Roding river and the Loxford water have been in a very grossly polluted condition, but generally there has not been nearly so much nuisance as in former years. Owing to the coolness and amount of rainfall during the summer the water courses intersecting the marshes have not been complained of. Chief Industries of District. 1. Beckton Gas Works.—This includes all kinds of labour, skilled and unskilled, coal porters, general labourers, stokers, engineers, etc. 2. Chemical Manure Works.—Including— (a) Manufacture of Manure and Disinfectants. (b) Manufacture of Sheep Dip. (No complaint of arsenical poisoning). 16 3. Tar "Works, Muriatic Acid Works, Varnish and Paints Works and other manufactories of a similiar nature. 4. Glass Bottle Manufacture. 5. India Rubber Mills. 6. Agriculture. 7. Iron Foundry Works. 8. All classes of workers, male and female, employed in London. 9. Various manufactories of light goods. General Inspection of District. A house to house inspection has been made during the year as the work in the department will allow. A summary of the work done in the sanitary department and nuisances detected will be found by reference to the Sanitary Inspector's report. I append a list as usual of those courts and alleys of the town which require special and constant attention. In all cases of Infectious disease special Inspections are made, and in connection with all complaints. 17 Name of Property. Sanitary Improvements required. St. John's Retreat The drain 1 to 4 needs re-laying. Partially re-drained These houses are now undergoing repair. The surface of the court has been improved. Red Lion Place Has been re-drained. Requires paving in front of houses. Alma Place Has been re-drained. The surface of the court should be drained and repaired where necessary. It has been suggested to cut up the surface of the court with gardens for the houses. Back Reform Place The main drain which receives the drainage from these houses, and also from Reform Place, North Street, has been relaid and ventilated. The house connections have been partially attended to. Back Lane The drains of Nos. 1 to 22 need re-laying Bifron's Square The drains belonging to this property have been reconstructed and ventilated. A w.c. has been provided for each house. The surface of the square has been made up with a road, curbed and channelled. The houses themselves have been modernised in appearance, and thoroughly renovated inside, and are let at a rental of 4s. 6d. per week inclusive. Several of the houses are needing attention. 18 Name of Property. Sanitary Improvements required. Linsdell's Court The surface of the court has been made up under the 150th section of the Public Health Act, 1875, and the houses are now let at a rental of 4s. per week inclusive. This property has again become most insanitary. Orchard Avenue The houses have been put in good repair and are now all occupied. Morgan's Yard The sewer has been relaid and ventilated And the court paved. Houses require cleaning. Morgan's Quay The main sewer has been relaid and ventilated, and the road made up. The paving at the back of the houses has been laid. The yard needs scavenging. The back ways have been separated with good effect. Factory Road and Emily Cottages These drains have been re-constructed and ventilated. The houses have been modernised, thoroughly cleansed and renovated. The back yards have been concreted and divided off in Factory Road. In Emily Cottages the back yards have been concreted but not divided. Park Terrace New water service has been laid on. Property in good order. Albert Terrace The sewers belonging to these properties need ventilating and re-construcing. It would probably prove a great advantage if the backs ways to these properlies were abolished. Collier Row 19 Name of Property. Sanitary Improvements required. Collier Place The drains belonging to this property have been re-constructed and ventilated. The hack ways have been done away which has been a great improvement. Barking Place The sewer has been relaid and ventilated. The Council do the scavenging. Garden Place These properties, all situated in Axe Street, have been re-sewered, fresh w.c. accommodation, and flushing cisterns provided. The yards are now partially paved. They need scavenging badly. New water service by arrangement with owner has been laid on for Suffolk place. Wellington Buildings Parson's Buildings Padnell Place Suffolk Place Arthur Cottages, East Street This property is now in the possession of the Railway Company. In fairly good order. Bridge Street, London Road Lands repaved, curbed, and channelled. Roofs attended to. Houses now in fair condition. The road is now being made up afresh. Over-the-Gates This property have been thoroughly inspected, and any defect fouud remedied, except in a few instances. Holly Square Fair condition. Main drain defective. Tanner Square Drain not ventilated, probably defective. 20 Drains found to be defective but not yet dealt with. Northbury Cottages— Defective, and should he relaid. 70-76, North Street, need relaying and ventilating 90-92, require ventilating and repairing 109-119, need relaying 85-103, need ventilating 105-7-8, need relaying (? private drain) 4-6, need relaying 14-16, need relaying 52-60, need relaying Broadway— 29-31, need ventilating, etc. 10-12, need ventilating and relaying 41-43, need relaying and ventilating 45, needs relaying. (? private drain) 33, needs ventilating, etc. Heath Street— 5, needs relaying 1-3, need relaying. Axe Street— 49-59, need ventilating and possibly relaying Fish Offal Collection. No complaint has come to hand duiing the year. 21 Scavenging. This is undertaken by the Council, and in my opinion is done very well. As I have pointed out before, the courts abutting on Axe Street and Fisher Street should come within the scope of their operations. At present they are suffering badly for the want of it. Collection of House Refuse. The Council's men visit every house in the distriot once a week. This means about 800 calls per diem. The responsibility for tho proper carrying out of this item is in the hands of the Public Health Department. The only complaints of noncollection which have been received have been due to unavoidable delay through holidays. The gross cost of the work for the year ending March 31st, 1907, was £1,209, which means that the cost per house per week was just one penny. Sewerage and Sewage Disposal. The disposal of the sludge at the works has occupied a good deal of attention during the year, and some quantity has been removed by barge. The same method as in former years is adopted for sewage treatment, viz., the precipitation of the sludge by means of alumina salts. A very fair effluent is thus obtained. The Shone elevators are still working well. 22 The emptying of cesspools has been greatly facilitated by the purchase of an exhauster, by which means the work is done in much less time and at about half the cost, and as there is no smell the work may be carried on in the daytime without contravening police regulations. The question of the extension of the public sewer to Creeksmouth has been discussed, but no scheme has been adopted. Offensive Trades. No offensive trade has yet been licensed in the district, but bye-laws have been adopted by the Council, and confirmed by the Local Government Board, with respect to these trades. Houses of the Working Classes. Houses of the smfll cottage type are still greatly in demand. Four rooms and a wash-house are the usual size, but I am sure a fair number with a bedroom extra are greatly needed. The rent, usually obtained is 5s. 6d. per weak, inclusive, for the smaller The houses belonging to the Council let well, and just about pay for themselves. It is thought that the extension of the District trains to Barking will create more demand for these houses, though even at the present time there are only 218 houses empty in the town, or just 4 per cent. 23 In the section of this report devoted to inspection will he found a table shewing briefly the condition of the slum propertyremaining in the town. There are only one or two slums left which cause much trouble, and to a very large extent their condition is due to the habits of the people themselves. Factory and Workshop Act, 1901.

Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria. Total North Street 1.6 .5 1.5 Gascoigne Road 1.05 .4 1.45 Westbury 1.1 .4 1.5 Church of England 1.07 .3 1.37 Roman Catholic .8 .8 1.6 Creeksmouth 1.1 .0 1.1 Castle 2.0 .0 2.0 The total number of children attending the Public Elementary Schools of the Council was on January 30th, 1908, 6,338; which gives a total percentage of scholars attacked by Scarlet Fever during the year of l.2 per cent., by Diphtheria .4 per cent., or a total of 1.6 per cent. attacked by notifiable Infectious Disease during the year. This seems to me to be a most excellent record. On several occasions on the occurrence of cases of Scarlet Fever in one class I have examined the whole, but during this year have not discovered any undetected case. A large number of dirty and verminous children have been visited and cleansed, and rendered fit to attend school. I regret very much to add that in my opinion there is a great lack of cleanliness in our midst, which is sadly apparent in the condition of the children and the Lome. I am quite sure too that it is on the increase. No real progress either in sanitation or education will ever be made without the insistence of parental responsibility to a much larger extent than has been done up to the present. In my judgment the Act for providing needy children with food 27 and medical inspection both work in that direction. In the work of examining and cleansing of the children the services of the Lady Health Visitor have been invaluable. During the year there has not been any epidemic of either Measles or Whooping Cough, nor has it been found necessary to close any school or class for the occurrence of infectious disease. Infantile Mortality, 1907. Early in the year the position of Barking Town in relation to this question was discussed by the Council, and several recommendations were adopted, and subsequently carried into effect. These recommendations were: (a) That a register of all births be kept in the Public Health Department, giving particulars as to parentage, environment, food, number in family, etc. This was begun on April 1st, and all the registered births were visited and generally looked after. This item is now working more efficiently by the adoption of the Notification of Births, Act, 1907, which came into force in the district on January 1st, 1908. (b) The appointment of a Lady Health Visitor. This appointment was made on 9th April, and the lady commenced her duties on the 27th of May. I am of opinion that her services have been of the greatest possible value to the district, and especially in the poorest 28 localities. Mothers of all classes accorded her a hearty welcome, except a very few who refused her admittance into their house, and contemned any suggestions she might have to make. Every house, with very few exceptions, in which a birth has been registered since April 1st, 1907, has been visited, and in many cases re-visited, the number up to December 31st, totalling 415 primary visits, but not including re-visits. On October 23rd I was allowed by the Council to obtain the services of a Probationer Health Visitor to assist in the work of visiting and re-visiting, to which latter I attach very great importance, as it is only by frequent observation and encouragement that one can hope in the poorest districts to get much success. (c) A pure milk supply. I was partially able to solve this difficulty by supplying a special modified preparation of dried milk. To those who were able to provide it for themselves I recommended its adoption through the ordinary business channels. The poorest (those who were absolutely destitute) got it free, and others paid what they could. The Council had no power to help financially in this, so that I had to rely on the generosity of the Councillors individually, and others, including the manufacturers of the food, to come to the rescue. The results were far beyond my most sanguine expectations. When systematically and properly given I had no failure. The children were weighed regularly every fortnight, and in most instances increased in weight, and developed very satisfactorily. See following table — 29 Age of Child. Date and Weight at commencement. and Weight when discontinued. 4 months 26th June, 11lbs. 8oz. 2nd Dec., 161bs. 8oz. 9 „ 22nd Aug., 141bs. 19th Nov., 151bs. 8oz. 3 „ 21st Aug., 11lbs. 4oz. 3rd Dec., 131bs 8oz. 1 month 20th Aug., 81bs. 6oz. 9th Dec., 14lbs 6oz. 1 „ 1st July, 8lbs. 2nd Dec., lllbs. 4oz.

In connection with food supply, one of the most satisfactory discoveries has been the number of breast-fed infants. We found that out of 415 enquires, 336 were breast-fed, 53 partially breastfed and hand-fed, and only 26 entirely hand-fed. I consider these figures very good indeed, and I am confident if I can assure proper food for the hand-feds and partially hand-feds, and by visiting and instructing the mothers so that the milk for the breast-feds is kept up to the standard necessary for the nourishment and development of the infant (and this is not always the case), we shall find that the mortality in infants from diarrhœa, malassimilation, and other wasting diseases, will permanently lessen. The circulation of leaflets with instructions as to feeding and the general care of infants has been, I am sure, useful, 30 I have been compelled through lack of funds to stop the distribution of milk at the Public Offices, and with it the ystematic weighing and inspection of infants has greatly diminished, but I am hoping to begin again shortly and encourage mothers to bring their children to be weighed, and so to be quite sure of the proper assimilation of their food. The question of infantile mortality is admittedly a very complex one, and it will probably necessitate years of patient i nvestigation and labour to permanently reduce it in a population such as we have to deal with at Barking. The following are the principal causes of infantile death during 1906-07:— 1907. 1906. Diarrhoeal Diseases 11 41 Wasting Diseases— Premature Birth 19 12 Congential Defects 7 3 Atrophy, Debility, Marasmus 18 21 Tuberculous Diseases 8 7 Convulsions 7 16 Bronchitis and Pneumonia 14 7 Overlying 2 6 86 113 The average infantile mortality rate for the past 10 years was 162 per 1,000 births registered, and the rate for the year 1907 was 112. This low rate I believe to be almost entirely due to the cool summer which brought with it a low mortality from epidemic diarrhoea. The number of deaths from this disease in 1906 being 56, and for 1907, 15. 31 The infantile mortality rate for the first six months of 1907 was 117, and for the second six months 108, thus shewing that a very considerable waste is going on continually, quite apart from the heavy mortality usually coming on in the third quarter from diarrhoea. In 1907 the Diarrhœa rate was almost nil, but in 1906 the mortality was very heavy from that disease. The infantile mortality rate for the first six months of 1906 was 110, and for the second six months 210, but this latter includes 41 deaths from diarrhoea, which if excluded gives a rate of 120, which is about the average or a little above it. Therefore, apart from diarrhœl diseases, the infantile mortality rate in Barking is too high. Infectious disease is responsible for a variable number depending to a large extent upon whether there has been or has not been an epidemic of Measles or Whooping Cough during the year. Tuberculous diseases caused 8 deaths in 1907, and 7 in 1906, or a rate of about .9 per 1,000 births registered. With regard to Wasting Diseases (Premature Birth, Atrophy, Debility and Marasmus are the chief names under which this condition is registered) a rate per 1,000 births registered of 50.7 is obtained. Out of this number premature birth and congenital defects account for 29.9, and premature births alone for 21.8. How many deaths among these is due to congenital weakness only I think it very difficult to say, but in my opinion in Barking very few. Probably if the premature births were properly looked after and properly fed most would live, and the same 32 remark applies to those certified as dying from atrophy, debility, and marasmus. It is on these lines that our efforts will be directed during the coming year, giving special attention to those infants apparently belonging to the class just referred to. As to Ante-Natal causes, and the effect on the child of maternal weakness or disease, we find reliable information is difficult to obtain without great tact and care, but most valuable. From semi-official returns I know of about 30 still-births, and as many abortions occurring during the year, and if we add to these numbers 19 deaths from premature birth, 7 from congenital defect, and 18 from atrophy, etc, we get a total of 104 losses at least, which may be due and probably are due primarily to maternal influence. As regards ante-natal causes of infantile deaths, I do not think I can do better than quote the words of Dr. J. W. Ballantyne at the Infantile Mortality Congress last year in a most able paper on the subject. He says "most of the causes of infantile deaths are post-natal in operation; but ante-natal causes are not a negligible quantity and must be kept in mind." In conclusion, one feels that to pull down the infantile mortality rate a tough piece of work has been undertaken, but if we are on the right road, and I believe we are, we shall in time be rewarded by some measure, perhaps a large measure of success. Accident Ambulance. At the beginning of the year a fund was started with the object of providing the town with an accident ambulance. The 33 Urban Council, through their Clerk, solicited subscriptions, to which such a generous reponse was made that in a very short time about £120 was collected. The selection and equipment of the ambulance was left in the hands of a sub-committee, and during the month of July the ambulance was delivered and started work. In my opinion it has been of the greatest possible benefit in the town. Cases of accident and acute disease have been removed to hospital without injury, and with a minimum of inconvenience. To the poorest no charge is made, and the remainder pay as much as they can towards the cost of removal. PART II. INFECTIOUS DISEASES, ETC. 35 Infectious Disease. STEPS TAKEN TO PREVENT INFECTION. On the receipt of a notification of infectious disease the residence of the sufferer is at once visited by a member of the sanitary staff with a view to obtain particulars as to means of isolation, cause of infection, condition of the premises, overcrowding, cleanliness, &c. If necessary the case is then removed to the Isolation Hospital and the bed, bedding and room disinfected. If the patient remains at home the necessary instructions are given and disinfectants supplied. A postcard is left at the house to be filled up by the doctor attending when the case is ready for disinfection. Notices are sent from the Public Health Department to the schools at which the patient was attending, or those who may have been in contact with infection. The Attendance Officers, the Librarian and Pawnshops are also notified. In cases of Scarlet Fever, in addition to the disinfoction by means of formalin spray, the rooms are stripped, re-papered and whitewashed where necessary. The following tables show the distribution, age, and place of treatment of the cases notified during 1907:— Disease. North. South. East. West. Total.

This gives zymotic case rate of 7.9 which is the lowest for which I have any record. The zymotic death rate was 1.2 which is the lowest since 37 The total number of deaths from notified Infectious Disease during 1907 was 10, or a death rate per cent. of 4.2. Out of the total number of notified cases, 107 occurred in the children attending school, or 45 per cent. Scarlet Fever.

The number of cases treated in the hospital was 110 or a percentage of 86.6. The number treated at home was 17 only. Four cases out of the total were return cases. 38 Diphtheria. The Diphtheria cases occurring in the district again shewed a decrease as compared with the preceding year, in tact it was the lowest number recorded in any year since 1899. The number of deaths was 6, or a death rate of 11.7 per cent., or of .2 per 1,000 persons living. 82.3 per cent. of the cases were treated in the Hospital, where the death rate was 9.5 per cent. that is nearly 2 per cent. less than outside. The age period between one year and under five was the most fatal, no less than 83 per cent. of the cases occurring then. I should like again to draw the attention of the Council to the following resolution passed by the London County Council with regard to the prevention of Diphtheria in Schools:— "That the Education Committee be authorised to refuse during the presence of Diphtheria in any district re-admission to school of children excluded on account of Diphtheria or Sore Throat until such children shall have obtained a medical certificate of freedom from infection, based on a bacteriological examination." I also recommend that a further resolution be passed that no child should be allowed to return to school until two weeks have elapsed after he or she has been discharged from Hospital, or certified as " clear " when treated at home. I append the following table for comparison with former years:— 39 Year. No. of Cases. Deaths. No. treated in Hospital. Percentage treated in Hospital. Death Rate per cent.

The number of notified eases during the year was 28 with 3 deaths. This is a larger number than last year, when the number was very small indeed. In the first six months of the year only 9 cases occurred. The number in the latter part of the year was greatly increased by a small outbreak in and around Morley Road. Seven cases were found in one house, and apart from this the amount of infection was about the same as the year before, I found it exceedingly difficult to assign a cause. The milk and water supplies were carefully overhauled, and a bacteriological examination made of the suspicious ones. No Bacillus Typhosus were found, but the milk was found to be very dircy. The chief point against the milk being the cause of infection was the fact that large numbers of persons partook of the same milk all over the town, but the only people who got it were those living in that particular locality, therefore I think we were justified in assuming 40 that there was some local influence at work. In that particular group of houses in which most of the cases occurred the drains were thoroughly tested with the smoke test, and also opened up and examined, but no serious defect was found, except that the ventilation was, in my opinion, insufficient. The cases ceased as quickly as they came and all recovered. I append a list of the cases shewing the different localities in which they occurred. All the defects in the sewers and drains were remedied, and further ventilation shafts are to be provided in that locality therefore.

Phthisis. The number of deaths registered from this disease during the year 1907 was 39, which gives a death rate from this disease of 13 per thousand of the estimated population. In 1906 the rate was .6 per thousand or a little less than half. This year was the first in which the voluntary notifications of phthisis was adopted in the district and it is very curious that in that year the number of cases should go up to double the normal or very nearly so. I have no facts at present available to propound any theory to account for it, possibly it is merely coincidental, but be the reason for it what 42 it may the figures are very curious 39 deaths and 45 notifications. The number of deaths to notifications is accounted for I think by the fact that many of the notifications were cases which were in the last stage; this discrepancy will of course right itself this year. In the first year of notification a number of the old chronic cases were swept in. As to the usefulness or not of voluntary notification it is early to give an opinion, but as far as we have gone in Barking I think it is likely to prove most beneficial. The treatment of the disease among the poor from which most of our cases are drawn is admittedly most unsatisfactory. In a fair number I succeeded after a very great deal of difficulty in getting in-patients letters for them for one or other of the consumptiv e hospitals. I found that in all cases there was benefit and in many cases great benefit, but on their discharge from hospital and the return to the old surroundings the old symptoms returned, and in a few months the sufferer was as bad as ever. A great many (some of them the poorest) after struggling along for varying periods find their way into the Union Infirmary. Cancer. The number of cases dying from this disease during the year was 8, as against 12 for the year before. This gives a crude rate per 1,000 persons living of .27. Seven of these took place in the age period 25 to 65, and only one in the age period 65 upwards. 43 Measles. This disease has been singularly absent during the year. No Schools or Classes have been closed. The death rate per 1,000 persons living works out at .13. Whooping Cough. There were a large number of cases of this disease in the earlier months of the year, though only eight deaths were recorded. This gives a death rate per 1,000 persons living of .27. Erysipelas. No death occurred during the year from this disease. Twenty-one cases were notified. Puerperal Fever. Three cases were notified, and one died. Disinfection was in every case thoroughly carried out, especially as regards the nurse in attendance. Small Pox. No case has been notified during the year. 44 Vaccination. The total number of Primary Vaccinations performed during the past four years is as follows Vaccinations. No. of Primary No. of Births. 1907 786 868 1906 768 873 1905 761 900 1904 769 896 1903 907 856 Rainfall in 1907. Observer: Mr. T. Booton.

The rainfall for the year 1906 was 22.94 inches. 45 Pauperism during 1907. I am assured by the Relieving Officer that there has not been an excessive amount of pauperism in the town during the past year. Further Sanitary Requirements of the District. 1. An improved method of dealing with the sludge at the Sewerage Works. 2. New Nursing Home and administration block at Hospital. 3. Suitable means of sewage disposal at the Hospital. Vital Statistics. THE DEATH RATE. The nett death rate for the year is 10.8 of the estimated population (June 1907). This is the lowest rate for which I have any record. The average nett rate for the past 10 years works out at 16.5 per 1,000 The uncorrected rate for 10 years (1897-1806) =15.0. The uncorrected rate for 1907=9.1. 16 The total number of deaths was 320, against 360 last year. Ten years ago the total number was 360, and the population was estimated at 18,500. The deaths divided according to the different age periods are as follows:— Under 1 year 98 143 One year and under 5 year 46 68 Total under 5 years 144 211 Five years and under 15 years 14 14 Fifteen and under 25 years 11 15 Twenty-five years and under 65 years 108 70 Sixty-five year3 and upwards 43 50 Total 320 360 In comparing these figures with those of last year the decrease in the proportion of deaths under five is noticeable and encouraging. In 1906 the deaths under five years were in the proportion of 53 per cent. to the total number, and in 1907 only 45 per cent. The only other noticeable features I think in regard to the numbers in the particular age periods are the larger number of deaths from Phthisis in 1907, viz., 22 iu the age period 25 to 65, as against 13 in the same age period in 1906, and Heart Disease which gives 7 in 1903, and 15 in 1907. The Birth Rate. The number of births registered in 1907 was 868, which gives a birth rate for the district of 29.4 This is the lowest for which there is any record. 47 The following list shews the gradual and steady decline of the rate in the district. Ten years ago the birth rate was 41.6 per 1,000. 1900 36.4 1901 36.7 1902 34.7 1903 34.2 1904 33.8 1905 32.1 1906 30 1907 29.4 ZYMOTIC DEATH RATE Per 1,000 persons living 1.2 1906 3.22 1905 2.7 1904 3.66 1903 2.24 1902 2.55 ZYMOTIC CASE RATE Per thousand persons living 7.9 1906 8.19 1905 9.2 1904 10.7 1903 13.6 1902 14.5 Marriages. Number 144. Rate per 1,000 persons living, 18.4. 48 Isolation Hospital. The number of cases removed to Hospital during the year was 176, viz.:— Membranous Croup 2 Enteric Fever 15 Diphtheria 52 Scarlet Fever 107 Outside Cases 14 Cases remaining in the Hospital on January, 1907 29 Total 219 The total number of deaths out of this was 7, which give a nett death rate if 31 of the total cases admitted, or a rate of 3.6 excluding the cases remaining in at the beginning of the year. Diphtheria.—These cases as regards severity have been much the same as in former years, I cannot see any diminution in the virulence of the poison as has been alleged, but I find they are brought under treatment sooner and so the serum injected can operate benefically. The mortality rate works out at 7.6 per cent., as against 7.1 per cent. last year. Cases of marked paralysis seem to have disappeared, I have not observed one during the year, nor have I seen one case of collapse in the second week, a condition which 15 years ago was very common. Cases of the Laryngeal variety have been very common, and I am glad to say most successful in result. Scarlet Fever.—These cases have been numbered the same as last year. Only one case died, though many more were very serious cases of the disease. The mortality rate was .8 per cent 49 The number of return cases was very small, only three times during the year did we get eases returned after a patient had been discharged. There had not been any post Scarletinal Diphtheria cases or any return eases of Diphtheria. Enteric Fever.—Fifteen cases have been treated during the year and all have recovered. There has been accommodation for all cases requiring admission during the year, though I could wish that the wards were more up-to-date. The results, however, shew a record which leaves little to be desired. The Staff consists of:— Matron Staff Nurse Three Assistant Nurses Three Probationers Three Ward Maids Cook Laundry Maid (with Assistant) Caretaker The cost for the year ending December 31st, 1906, was £1,436 inclusive of everything, or at the rate of £6 10s. per patient, or 3/6 per diem whilst in the Hospital. The average number of days each patient was detained was 37. I think these figures are most satisfactory. I regret very much indeed, that the accommodation for nurses, and the kitchen, and food storing accommodation remain as they were, and trust that the Council may see their way to consider these matters at the very earliest opportunity. 50 The year under survey has been in many respects a very active one with respect to Public Health administration. The voluntary notification of Phthisis has also been adopted with the greatest benefit, especially to the poor. The subject of Infantile Mortality has been well to the fore, and with the appointment of a Health Visitor and instructions to mothers as to proper food for the infant, not forgetting the attempt to supply the very poorest with that food, I think we ought in time to see some good result. The Notification of Births Act, 1907, has also come into force and should prove of very great value. No one who has watched the growth and development of infants when fed and mothered as they should be will have the slightest doubt as to the physical soundness of our population. Under the auspices of the Philanthropic Society a Baby Show was held in the summer and a more creditable display of infant life could not possibly be found anywhere.

SANITARY INSPECTOR. Public Health Department, Public Offices, Barkings March, 1908. To the Chairman and Members of the Barking Town Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report dealing with the sanitary work carried out during the year 1907. Inspections. The number of Inspections made during the year was 2,009, these include house to house inspections, houses in which Infectious Disease occurred, houses which have been the subject of complaint, and miscellaneous inspections. In 1,460 of the houses inspected sanitary defects were discovered, and to effect the remedying of these defects it was necessary to serve 732 preliminary and 92 statutory notices and it also involved the writing of a number of letters. In a number of instances defects wore remedied alter personal interview with 56 the owner, and it is satisfactory to note that in no case was it necessary to have recourse to legal proceedings. House to House Inspections.
