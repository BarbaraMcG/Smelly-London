Smith that the Bill having been reached before 12 on the 1st inst., it had been impossible to prevent the Bill being read a second time, and that there remained no alternative but for the parishes to appear before the Select Committee, whereupon it was resolved that the Vestry appear by Counsel for the purpose of obtaining an equitable adjustment of the cost of the maintenance of the New Streets on the most favourable terms. ST. JAMES'S PALACE. As the result of prolonged negociations and communications a letter was, on the 16th April, 1885, submitted to the Vestry from H.M. Treasury stating that they would be prepared to contribute a sum of £450 per annum in respect of residences and apartments in St. James's Palace, not in the personal occupation of the Sovereign, on the Vestry and Overseers agreeing that so long as such contribution is received no rates shall be made by the parish upon the occupier of any such residences or apartments.

DUNCAN IRVINE, 1 RICHARD WILLIAMSON, J Auditors. Vestry Hall, 22nd June, 1886. 70 MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT, 18 8 5. Annual Report on the Health of the Parish of St. Martin-in-theFields,for the Year 1885. To the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you my Sixteenth Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Parish. Births. During the year 1885 there were 350 Births registered, of which 180 were males, and 170 females. This is the lowest number of the last 10 years. For many years past the births have been gradually decreasing in the Parish, owing, as I stated in my Annual Report for the year 1884, to so many of the families of the inhabitants residing in the suburbs. 71 The following Table gives the number of Births occurring in each month of the year:— Males. Females. Total. January 14 14 28 February 7 15 22 March 15 22 37 April 19 10 29 May 13 13 26 June 15 11 26 July 14 15 29 August 14 9 23 September 13 28 41 October 16 14 30 November 16 11 27 December 24 8 32 180 170 350 The birth-rate of the parish for the year 1885 was 19.3 per 1,000 of the population. The birth-rate for the whole of London in the year 1885 was 32.6 per 1,000. Deaths. In the year 1885 there were registered 426 Deaths, of which 250 were males, and 176 females; this number was 43 more than in the previous year. 72 The following Table gives the number of Deaths occurring in each month of the year:— Males. Females. Total. January 26 19 45 February 18 13 31 March 24 13 37 April 21 25 46 May 22 16 38 June 14 13 27 July 21 9 30 August 21 9 30 September 17 12 29 October 19 14 33 November 21 15 36 December 26 18 44 250 176 426 Of the above 426 Deaths, 177 occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, and of this number who died in that Institution, 139 were non-residents in the Parish. In public institutions situate without the Parish, 64 deaths of Parishioners occurred. Amongst the tables will be found one giving details of these 64 deaths. The Death-rate of the parish for the year 1885 was 19*3 per 1,000, slightly less than in the previous year. Ratio of deaths to population, 1 in 51 7. 73 The Deaths registered in London during the year 1885 were exactly 80,000, and corresponded to an annual rate of 19.7 per 1,000 inhabitants. This was the lowest rate on record in London. Appended is the annual death-rate per 1,000 in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields during the last ten years:— 1876 17.2 1877 16.9 1878 17.5 1879 18.6 1880 16.8 1881 18.5 1882 17.6 *1883 19.0 1884 19.7 1885 19.3 Ages at Death. Of the above 426 total deaths occurring within the parish, 64 were under 1 year, 49 from 1 to 5 years, 36 from 5 to 20 years, 91 from 20 to 40 years, 106 from 40 to 60 years, 71 from 60 to 80 years, and 9 above 80 years. *This is the first year returns have been supplied to me from the Registrar-General's Office of deaths of parishioners occurring in Public Institutions outside the Parish, which deaths have been added to the death-rate.—J. J. s. 74 Causes of Death. Zymotic Diseases.—The seven principal Zymotic Diseases are Small-pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Fever, and Diarrhoea. From these complaints 30 deaths occurred. This number is 17 less than in the previous year, and the lowest of the last ten years, with the exception of the year 1877, when the deaths from this class of disease numbered 26. Small-pox.—No death from this malady occurred in the Parish. Six cases came to my knowledge, 1 passed through the complaint at home, the other 5 were removed to Hospital, 4 of which died. Measles.—Nine deaths were recorded from this complaint. Scarlet Fever.—As in the previous year only 1 death occurred from this disease. Two cases coming under my notice were removed to Hospital and there recovered. Diphtheria.—Three deaths were due to this disease, the lowest number of the last 7 years. Whooping Cough.—Seven deaths were registered from this disorder, against 13 of the previous year. Fever.—This includes Typhus, Typhoid, Simple Continued Fever, and Remittent Fever. Four deaths only were due to this class of disease. In the years 75 1885 and 1876 the mortality from fever was the lowest of the last ten years, the number of deaths in each of those years being 4. Diarrhœa.—Six deaths were due to this complaint, all in children under 5, and the lowest number during the last ten years. Diseases of the Respiratory Organs, including Consumption, destroyed 126. 11 less than in the previous year. Disease of the Heart.—39 deaths were due to this complaint, against 24 of the previous year. Cancer was fatal to 22 persons. The deaths from all other causes, with the ages, at death, will be found fully detailed in a table further on. Inquests. In the year 1885, there were held 63 inquests. Subjoined are the causes which produced death:— Natural causes 24 Injuries received from being knocked down or run over in the street 8 Burns and scalds 5 Carried forward 37 76 Brought forward 37 Suffocation 5 Injuries received from falling downstairs 2 Drowning. 3 Poison. Nitric Acid 1 „ Chloral 1 „ Laudanum 1 Pistol-shot wound 1 Chloroform when about to undergo an operation 1 Wound of throat 2 Found in the River Thames suffering from fracture of skull and spine 1 Found in Pall Mall in a helpless condition suffering from fracture of thigh 1 Injuries received from falling off the driving seat of a cab .. .. 1 Injuries received from falling off a ladder 1 Injuries received from falling off an omnibus 1 Injuries received from falling off roof of house 1 Injuries received from falling off a staging at Cox's Bank 1 Injuries received from falling out of bed 1 Injuries received from falling down the well of a staircase 1 63 77 Sanitary Work. In the year 1885, 110 notices were served upon the owners or occupiers of property, besides numerous verbal recommendations to remedy nuisances and sanitary defects. Cecil Court.—In one of my fortnightly reports towards the latter part of the year 1884, I brought to your notice the unsanitary condition of the houses in Cecil Court. I pointed out in a letter (a copy of which I read to you) addressed to the Agent of the property, the bad and unwholesome condition of these premises, and that they were not at all suited for the habitation of so many families. After a great deal of correspondence, extending over several months, had passed between the Agent and myself, it was eventually arranged that the Agent and I, in company with your Surveyor, should make an inspection of the houses in question. We did so and arrived at the conclusion that the houses were past repair and should be closed. The Agent accordingly promised he would give the tenants three months notice to quit. They are now (June 1886) nearly all closed with a few exceptions, which are in a less dilapidated condition. Hunt's Court, Leicester Square.—I also drew your attention to the unsanitary and decayed condition of the house number 7 in this court. Subsequently . your Surveyor and I made an inspection of this house, 78 when we both agreed it should either be demolished or closed. The owner eventually voluntarily caused the premises to be vacated and closed, without our having to resort to legal measures. Bake-Houses. The bake-houses have been duly inspected, and with the exception of three, which required limewhiting, they were all in a cleanly and orderly condition. I could not ascertain that any lad under the age of 18 was employed during the restricted hours, viz., from 9 o'clock at night till 5 o'clock in the morning. Houses Let Out in Lodgings. Your Inspector, whom you appointed permanent inspector of these houses, has regularly inspected them, and reported to me all sanitary defects that may come under his notice. By your directions I drew up a sanitary notice which was printed and freely distributed amongst the parishioners. In this notice suggestions were made as to the management of dust-bins, water-cisterns, w.c.'s, stables, etc., also recommendations for the use of disinfectants. The pipe-sewers have been regularly flushed, those gullies emitting offensive effluvia have also been 79 flushed with carbolic acid and water, and the several courts and passages in the Parish lime-whited. In conclusion, I must again bear testimony to the zeal and intelligence of your Inspector in the discharge of his duties, and also acknowledge with thanks the promptitude with which the Relieving Officer of the district keeps me informed of all infectious diseases and nuisances coming under his notice. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN J. SKEGG, Medical Officer of Health. 29, Craven Street, June, 1886. 80 BIRTHS and DEATHS, &c., for the last Ten Years. 1876 1877 1878 1879 1880 1881 1882 1883 1884 1885 Births 494 491 467 481 445 418 412 403 401 350 Deaths 418 466 519 557 491 451 474 408 469 426 ,, under 5 years 152 133 177 184 171 138 164 146 142 113 ,, from 5 to 60 191 247 256 282 249 225 248 210 252 233 „ over 60 years 75 86 86 91 71 88 62 52 75 80 ,, from Small-pox 1 0 0 0 0 1 O 0 0 O ,, ,, Measles 5 5 3 5 5 7 7 27 8 9 ,, ,, Scarlet Fever 4 0 5 14 12 12 3 5 1 1 „ ,, Whooping Cough 11 5 12 12 20 7 13 2 13 7 „ ,, Diarrhoea 18 8 12 7 17 10 7 11 14 6 „ „ Fever 4 8 7 7 5 16 5 6 7 4 ,, „ Consumption 51 76 70 74 55 51 43 43 46 51 „ in Charing Cross Hospital 78 153 186 198 160 148 188 118 178 177 Inquests 54 63 65 60 49 74 69 54 73 63 81 TABLE OF THE CAUSES OF DEATH, AT VARIOUS AGES, In the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields,for the Year 1885.
