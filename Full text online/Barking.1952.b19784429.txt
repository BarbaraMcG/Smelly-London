Of this total 16 died within the first month of life, with prematurity being given as the cause of death in 8 of these cases. The infant mortality rate for Barking for 1952 is 21.66 and the table on this page gives the rates for the past 25 years. The average infant mortality rate in Barking for the past 5 years is 21.93. This is well below the rates for England and Wales for the same period. MATERNAL MORTALITY With regard to the maternal death recorded for 1952, it is to be noted that the onset of the principal cause of death in this case, i.e. damage to the brain tissues, occurred many years ago when unfortunately the deceased had a stroke during childbirth. Page 8 THE PREVALENCE OF AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Notification The following is a summary of the cases notified during the year:— Acute Anterior Poliomyelitis 9 Dysentery 17 Erysipelas 11 Food Poisoning 5 Measles 1,350 Meningococcal Infection 1 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 1 Paratyphoid Fever 1 Pemphigus Neonatorum 1 Pneumonia 48 Puerperal Pyrexia 18 Scabies 11 Scarlet Fever 104 Whooping Cough 100 No difficulty was met in arranging for the admission of cases to hospital, and most cases went to Ilford Isolation and Rush Green Hospitals. Acute Anterior Poliomyelitis Of the nine cases notified, eight developed paralytic symptomsunfortunately the disease proved fatal in one case. Diphtheria I am happy to record again that not one single case of diphtheria burred in Barking.

Apart from the serious lack of entrants, we have lost staff through promotion to other areas. Shortage of staff and changes in personnel have had the effect of slowing down the work and at the end of the year we were two inspectors below the establishment strength. Later in this report, will be found statistical tables showing the work of the Sanitary Inspectors. RAINFALL The rainfall for the year 1952 was 20.13 inches compared with 30.80 inches for the previous year and the number of days on which rain fell was 135. WATER SUPPLY South Essex Waterworks Company continues to supply water to all domestic dwellings in the Borough. All samples submitted for bacteriological and chemical examination were found to be pure and wholesome. Samples from the wells of three factory premises have also been examined and found satisfactory. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE Once again I am to report that there has been no change. The whole of the sewage is dealt with at the works of the London County Council. Page 12 Rivers and streams As from 1st October, 1952 the newly established Essex River Board Bassumed statutory responsibility within its area for the prevention of river pollution and other functions conferred upon it by the River Boards Act, 1948, and the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1951. It is hoped that the Board will do much to restore the wholesomeness of our rivers by preventing the contamination to which I referred in my last It is pleasing to note that certain major improvements are projected at Loxford Water and the Mayesbrook in the year 1953. DUTBIN OWNERSHIP BY THE CORPORATION The supply of dustbins by the Corporation has been a subject of much concern. Whilst the number of premises on record as premises where dustbins are supplied and maintained in accordance with Section 75(3) of the Public Health Act, 1936, has increased, a number of premises in one ownership, owing to default It on the part of the owners in maintaining their payments, have created new problem. Towards the end of the year the Council decided that ir future action should be taken in accordance with Section 75(1) instead of Section 75(3) of the Act. I realise this action was taken to meet the difficulties experienced following the increase in the dustbin charges to 5s. per annum. I regret the need for this change and would add that this dustbin problem, in my opinion, w ill not be resolved until the supply is one for the Corporation only and the cost borne as a rate charge. PUBLIC CLEANSING AND REFUSE DISPOSAL During the year, 62,638 yards of refuse were collected and disposed of by tipping at Jenkins Lane tip, the average weight being 5.58 cwts. per yard, and the total weight 17,434 tons. In addition, 46,446 tons of refuse from outside the Borough was also deposited at the Corporation tip. Tipping is carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Essex county Council Act, 1933 (Third Schedule). ERADICATION OF BED BUGS The standard of cleanliness in dwellings continues to improve. I am pleased to report that only 25 bug-infested properties called for action on the part of your officers and of these a number were minor infestations. Page 13 Of the properties treated with insecticide 12 are owned by the Corporation. FLY NUISANCE As anticipated in my last report the spray treatment of vacant lands, refuse tips, piggeries and stables has been very much extended during the summer months of the present year by the inclusion of the premises of fishmongers and butchers. In addition to the vacant lands, including grass verges, 47 premises were treated by the mobile spraying unit. This service which is operated at the low annual cost of £150, is welcorned by the residents in the Borough. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 RODENT CONTROL IN SEWERS Owing to heavy infestation in certain areas during the year 1951, the Infestation Control Division of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries authorised an interim treatment of those areas. This took place in February when 140 manholes were baited with the following results. Number showing prebait take 106 Number showing complete prebait take 77 Number showing poison bait take 91 This treatment was considered highly successful and the normal halfyearly treatments were carried out in the months of May and November with the following results. I May November Number of manholes baited 422 422 Number showing prebait take136 183 Number showing complete prebait take 32 61 SURFACE INFESTATION Rodent infestation above ground, subject to prior investigation by the Sanitary Inspectors, is dealt with by the Corporation's rodent operative who carries out treatments at factories, business premises, private dwellings and properties owned by the local authority. Private dwellings are cleared without charge but a charge of 5s. per hour is made for this service to factories and business premises. The following information is taken from the report furnished to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries for the year 1952. Page 14 1.

Page 15 ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION During the year measurement of atmospheric pollution was continued and revealed a fall in the average sootfall per square mile per month. This was in spite of an abnormally high deposition during the long period of fog in December. A comparative table is set out on page 17. Such a fall may be attributed to the fact that a number of factories in the Borough have been able to install new plant or overhaul existing plant so that their furnace equipment operates more efficiently and consequently with less smoke emission. Your officers have been continuously active in administering the Smoke Bye-laws and discussing with factory managements methods of reducing smoke emission. 283 atmospheric pollution investigations were carried out and 20 contraventions of the Smoke Bye-laws were dealt with. The increased popularity of the continuous burning stove has no doubt had a beneficial effect upon the pollution from domestic chimneys by burning coal more efficiently. The prolonged fog of December provided an opportunity for studying the effects of atmospheric pollution upon the public health. The fog itself was a purely natural phenomenon, not uncommon in such areas as the London Basin. It was quite shallow and photographs were taken on Bos Hill in bright sunshine showing the fog in the valley below. Atmospheric conditions were such that the fog was unable to rise and dissipate. All the smoke and sulphur dioxide emitted from the chimneys of the factories and houses of London was held by the fog and accumulated for four days. Much of this would have risen to the upper atmosphere and thus been spread over a wide area. The effect upon the health of the population of such a polluted atmosphere can be judged from the fact that in the administrative County of London deaths per million population during the week following the fog exceeded the normal by 445. In the Essex portion of Greater London the number of deaths was 2 1/2 times the normal. It is more than ever apparent that something positive must be done to overcome the menace to health and the waste of money and material resources which arise from the present use of our coal supplies. NOXIOUS FUMES The control of noxious fume emission still occupies the close attention of your officers. One company causing a nuisance from its chemical plant has left the district following representations from the Corporation.

This company carries on a variety of processes all of which are likely to cause a nuisance unless adequately supervised. Generally speaking it may be said that the complaints of nuisance from noxious fume emission have been less in number. EXHIBITION Once again we have staged an exhibition which was intended primarily to bring to the notice of the public how the health of the people could benefit by the use of smokeless fuel burning appliances. Coinciding as it did with the Charter Anniversary Celebrations, it was decided to take the opportunity of enlarging the scope of the Exhibition to include all the services provided by the Council for the people of Barking, and the title chosen for the event was "Barking Charter Anniversary Civic Exhibition". The Infestation Control Division of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries generously provided the stands which were used for the display of propaganda by the following Departments of the Council:—Public Health, Libraries, Town Clerk's, Borough Architect's, Borough Engineer's, Works Manager's, Education and the Borough Treasury. We were assisted in the sphere of atmospheric pollution by exhibits provided by the Electricity and Gas Boards and the Coal Utility Council. The Infestation Control Division provided a large speaking unit which displayed live rodents and insects together with an explanatory talking film exhibit. Background music was supplied by the courtesy of Messrs. CollaroLtd., to which Company thanks are due for the loan of a microgram. At an "open forum" in the Municipal Restaurant members of the public were able to ask a panel of speakers questions concerning "local government and the citizen". ATMOSPHERIC CORROSION OF METALS The apparatus for measuring atmospheric corrosion of metals, refers to in my last report, was removed in September, having satisfactorily Provided the information required. In a report issued by the British Iron and Steel Research Association and designated "Correlation of Atmospheric Corrosion and Atmospheric Pollution", it is stated:— "Early in 1951 arrangements were made to correlate the rates of corrosion of the reference specimens used for the work described in this report with the pollution of the atmosphere by sulphur dioxide. The Fuel Research Station, D.S.I.R. collaborated in this research by recommending sixteen suitable sites where routine determinations of sulphur Page 18 dioxide are being made and by rendering assistance with the exposure of some of the specimens. The sixteen sites were selected to represent four degrees of increasing pollution; "slight", "moderate", "considerable" and "severe", each degree being represented by four sites". The correlation of the figures obtained from the sixteen exposure sites demonstrates that the sulphur dioxide concentration in the air is the primary factor determining the intensity of corrosion in Great Britain. Examination of the tables issued with the report shows that the Barking site at Greatfields Park was found to be in an area of "considerable" contamination. Its place was closely approximate to the "moderate" group and only 50% of the contamination related to the "severe" group. The Corrosion Committee of the British Iron and Steel Research Association and also the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research expressed their thanks to the Corporation for its co-operation and help in the course of their research. SWIMMING BATHS AND POOL East Street Bath— This bath was used by 67,971 bathers during the open season of 22 weeks. Of this number 37,944 were children. It is of interest to note that the slipper baths were used on 43,500 occasions during the period of 12 months. Open Air Pool, Barking Park.—The pool was used by 80,827 bathers, including 53,445 children. Samples of baths water were taken during the year as follows:— East Street Bath 9 Open Air Pool 5 South East Essex Technical College 11 AH the samples were satisfactory on bacteriological examination. AGED AND INFIRM PERSONS The problem of aged and infirm persons, in many instances living alone, who are unable owing to their physical condition to devote to themselves proper care and attention remains unsolved. During the year we have investigated nine such cases, four of which volunteered for admission to institutions and were duly removed. Two cases were referred to the Essex County Welfare Officer. Of the remaining three cases, one was considered to be receiving care and attention by relatives in the same premises and two are being kept under observation from time to time. The conditions at their homes have improved.

These were dealt with as follows:— 47 repaired by owners. 2 legal proceedings instituted. 5 remaining outstanding and of these, work is in progress in 4 instances, the remaining 1 being held up at request of occupier. Where legal proceedings were instituted an order was obtained in the first case and the work was carried out by contractors on the owner's instructions and in the second case the Council did the work and the cost was made a charge on the property. In addition, works of repair to water closets, drains, gutters and rainwater pipes were carried out by the Borough Engineer in default of the owners at five premises. RENT AND MORTGAGE INTEREST RESTRICTIONS ACTS, 1920-39 One application was made by an occupier and a certificate was issued. ESSEX COUNTY COUNCIL ACT, 1933, PART IV Establishments for Massage and Special Treatment.—There are still four holders of licences to carry out massage and special treatment in the Borough. During the year the premises and records were inspected but no contraventions were found. HOUSING ACT, 1949—IMPROVEMENT GRANTS During the year two applications for grants under Section 20 of the Act were investigated by your officers. One application was referred to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government for approval, the other being refused. BURIAL OR CREMATION OF THE DEAD In accordance with the duties of the Local Authority under Sub-section (1) of Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the body of one deceased person was disposed of by burial during the year. FOOD POISONING The number of cases of Food Poisoning notified during the year showed a very pleasing reduction. Five cases were investigated and specimens sent to the Public Health Laboratory Service. Of these, three were reported to show Salmonella typhimurium. All the patients recovered. Page 27 FOOD ICE-CREAM—CHEMICAL EXAMINATION Forty-five samples were submitted for chemical examination. A summary of analysis is given below:— Samples submitted FAT ANALYSIS Under 2.5% 2.5%-5% 5 %-8.5 % 8.5%-10% Over 10% 45 — — 15 ICE-CREAM—BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION Seventy-seven samples of ice-cream were bacteriologically examined, These were also submitted to the Ministry of Health Provisional Methylene Blue Reduction Test. The results of these examinations are set out below:— Bacteriological Examination Satisfactory Unsatisfactory 77 68 9 Methylene Blue Test Grades I & II Grades III & IV 77 72 5 Ice-cream manufacturers, vendors and their premises, are required to be registered in accordance with the provisions of Section 160 of the Barking Corporation Act, 1933. Manufacturers.—At the commencement of the year, 3 manufacturers having premises within the area were so registered. Vendors.—91 vendors and their premises within the Borough and vendors with premises outside the Borough were registered for retail sale at the beginning of the year and during the year the following applications for registration have been received and granted:— Vendors with premises inside the area 15 „ „ „ outside the area MILK SUPPLY The number of premises registered with the Corporation for the retail sale of pre-packed milk is now 41. There are also 10 milk purveyors occupying premises in other districts registered to retail milk in Barking. Page 28 Seventy-four samples of milk were submitted to the methylene blue reduction test and phosphatase examination of which two were unsatisfactory. The unsatisfactory samples occurred during hot weather. Two samples of sterilized milk satisfied the turbidity test. Sixty samples were submitted to biological examination for the presence of tubercle and all were reported free from infection. SAMPLING OF FOOD AND DRUGS During the year 183 samples were submitted to chemical analysis, details of which are set out hereafter. The following three samples were reported to be unsatisfactory:— 1. Buttermints, 2. Butterscotch— In these cases the analyst reports that the samples of sugar confectionery, in each instance described by names in which the word "butter" appears, are objected to on the grounds that they contained insufficient butter fat to justify the description. In these samples the amount of butter content amounted to 0.5 per cent. and 1.0 per cent. respectively, whereas the content agreed between the Ministry of Food and the Confectionery trade was "not less than four per cent." unless qualified by the term "flavoured". 3. Chocolate Easter Eggs— The analyst confirmed that these small whole easter eggs had a mouldy taste and showed the presence of mould growths of which the cause could not be established. Appropriate action was taken by your officers in these cases. Proceedings were instituted in the following instances where food of which complaint was made was condemned. The results of these proceedings were as follows:— 1. Fairy cake, containing beetle— The defendant pleaded guilty and a fine of £5 was imposed. 2. Mouldy sausage rolls— The defendants pleaded guilty and were fined £10. 3. Mouldy meat pies.— In this case two partners in the defendant company were each fined £5 together with £1 for witnesses' expenses. The following schedules show the number and type of food samples submitted for examination and the unsound food condemned and destroyed during the year.

Table I.—Details of the families in Barking who have been rehoused during the year 1952. By Barking Council 110 By other Local Authorities 12 By own efforts 19 By exchanging accommodation 239 380 Table II.—The number of permanent dwellings in the control of the Council is as follows:— One-bedroom dwellings 319 Two-bedroom dwellings 1,464 Page 32 Three-bedroom dwellings 1,173 Four-bedroom dwellings 125 Five-bedroom dwellings 20 Total tenancies—4,194 Table III.—Total applications on Housing Register- 3,544 Families seeking transfer to other accommodation 855 The year has been one in which we have been marking time and endeavouring to alleviate the worst conditions of over-crowding and unfitness until progress is made with the large estate of 1,700 houses to be erected at the Thames View Site. It was unfortunate that circumstances arose which again prevented the erection of a substantial number of houses for general purposes, special purposes or slum clearance. Slow progress continues to be made with rehousing from clearance areas, due to the delay arising from a shortage of new accommodation. In consequence rehousing can only be carried out on the cleared site. For a considerable time the problem of the sub-standard house has been under consideration nationally and the Central Housing Advisory Committee appointed a special sub-committee to report. Among other requirements this sub-committee reported that a satisfactory house should be provided with an efficient and adequate means of supplying hot water for domestic purposes and have a fixed bath, preferably in a separate room. The general standard of housing in Barking is above the national average. There are 20,520 dwellings in the Borough. Of this number 12,400 were erected between the wars and a further 1,937 since the second world war. This leaves a balance of some 6,000 houses erected before 1914. Of this 6.000 it is estimated 3,400 are without bathrooms. Every house or flat has a w.c. inside the house in 15,000 of the total dwellings. Every house also has a piped main water supply inside the main building. The Council is aware that no less than 550 dwellings are scheduled for demolition as unfit when new accommodation can be provided for rehousing Purposes. In addition to these unsatisfactory dwellings there is a total of 180 families living in camp hutments. Such a situation cannot continue indefinitely and I am of the opinion the Council should consider in what way improvements can be made to the Standard houses in the Borough with a view to achieving such a standard comfort as is expected by present-day occupiers.
