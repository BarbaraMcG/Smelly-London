REPORT TO THE VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Vestry Hall; 30th June, 1870. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you the usual Annual Statements of Works executed, and the chief business transacted in the Paving, Lighting and Sewers Departments, during the year ending Lady-day, 1870:— Paving. The Footways in various Streets, exceeding one mile, have been re-paved and widened, and otherwise greatly improved. The Carriageways fronting Stables and Coach-houses in two Mews have been re-paved with squared stones, and rendered more convenient for the Occupiers and the Public. The Water Channels in several Streets have been improved by paving them with squared granite. 4 Twelve Crossings of Streets have been paved with the best description of Granite Cubes. Eight New Streets, or portions thereof, have been formed and paved by the Vestry under the powers of "The Metropolis Management Acts" at the cost of Owners of Houses and Land bounding or abutting on such Streets. Additional Streets have been completed by Owners of property at their expense, and to my satisfaction, and afterwards cleansed, watered and repaired at the cost of the Vestry, which, with the previous number, make 40 miles 3 furlongs 184 yards at the present time under the control of the Vestry. The Streets have been opened in 2318 places by Gas and Water Companies, and other parties, for the purpose of laying and repairing pipes, and effecting alterations and additions to Houses and Stables. Lighting. Thirty-nine additional Lamps have been erected in different parts of the Parish, making a total of 1614. Fifteen Lamps have been removed to new positions, in order to improve the lighting of several Streets, and to accord with the footways in such places as required widening. 5 Buildings, Sewers and Drains. Eighty-two Notices have been given to the Vestry for the erection of 264 Buildings; namely, 1 Church, 2 Public Schools, 1 Dairy Buildings, 217 Houses, and 43 Stables, in accordance with the 76th Section of the Act of 1855. The Orders of the Vestry in these cases have been notified to the Parties concerned. Sixty-four Applications for the construction of Drains under the Public Roads and Footways to 109 Houses and Premises have been received, and the Works executed at the cost of Owners of Property. Sewers in the undermentioned Streets and Places have been constructed by the Owners of Property at r their expense, viz.:— feet. ft. in ft. in, Elnathan Mews 600 run of 3.9 by 2 6 whole Brick Sewer. Saltram Crescent 2300 „ „ ditto Road between Warwick Road West and War 250 wick Road North Total 3150 The estimated value of the above-mentioned Sewers, together with 3 miles 1221 yards run of drain pipes laid down, is about £3475. 6 Two miles eleven hundred and fifty-nine yards of Brick Sewers, in which the deposit varied from six to nine inches in depth, have been cleansed, and the hard deposit removed, at a cost to the Vestry of £78: 7: 5. Five side entrances, seventeen Ventilating Shafts, and fifty-three Gulleys have been constructed and reconstructed, and forty-six Gulleys repaired in various parts of the Parish. One hundred and seven Gulleys have been cleansed, at a cost to the Vestry of £12: 16: 8. Six hundred and eighty-five distinct Works relative to the repair of Sewers and Gulleys, laying pipe drains, fixing traps, &c., have been executed, at a cost of £1056: 15: 1. This amount includes the sum of £457: 15: 3 received from Owners of Property, for fixing traps at outlets of existing Drains, constructing Gulleys, and laying Drain Pipes under Streets. In addition to the before-mentioned Works, two hundred and twenty-five complaints have been attended to, chiefly with reference to Sewers, Gulleys, Drains and Pavements. 7 Re-Naming Streets and Re-Numbering Houses.

The localities and streets in which these deaths occur are shown in my Quarterly Reports. 6 When we consider the annual increase of population, this is highly satisfactory to find the Zymotic forms of disease do not increase in proportion; and had not the Scarlet Fever epidemic intervened, there would have been a very great diminution in this preventible class of diseases. Systematic House to House Inspections. The materials accumulated by systematic house to house inspection are now of great value and interest as a study of the condition of streets and houses sublet and occupied by weekly lodgers. The issue of some thousands of sanitary orders during the last few years, many of which are for constructive work, must have had the effect of lessening the discomfort and dangers to which the working population in these streets are exposed. The death-rate is however very high in the tenant house population generally; not from any neglect of local authority in this Parish, but from causes inherent in the people themselves. Much time and zealous effort to train and teach people sanitary and social economy will have to be spent before they learn to husband the resources necessary for keeping themselves in health, strength or comfort. Want of space for breathing or overcrowding is the worst evil they have to contend against, and it is the most difficult to deal with; except, perhaps, intemperance, which too often acts both as a cause and an aggravation of the mischief. An average cubic space for each individual of a family consisting of man, wife, and three to five children, living in a single room, is in some instances less than 200 feet, while 400 or 500 are necessary. It may easily be imagined when the doors and windows of houses are closed at night, how readily the air is polluted—even rendered poisonous by rebreathing. PARISH OF PADDINGTON. TABLE V.

Many families are living happily on their limited means, paying 3s. 6d. or 4s. a-week rent for a kitchen in a clean and respectable house. It is a puzzle to me to know what to do with a family so circumstanced, and more so, if the people are dirty in their habits, and if Scarlatina or Measles break out with one of the children. They cannot be treated as paupers. The extent to which overcrowding has been abated in some streets of this parish may be demonstrated by comparing returns of former inspections with the most recent one. Streets and Places.

An epidemic of Scarlet Fever has been prevalent more or less in all parts of the Metropolis during the last 18 months; and it has scarcely yet subsided. Paddington has severely suffered. In the details here appended, I have shown its progress, and the distribution of fatal cases, and as far as the limited space at my command will permit I will endeavour to point out some matters of interest relative to its propagation, with the best methods of checking its ravages amongst the community. The large annual loss of life in this country from Scarlet Fever, and its frequent occurrence as an epidemic, are matters of sufficient public concern to render any contribution acceptable to those who are entrusted with the administration of laws relating to public health. The total mortality during the last 18 months is shown in the following table :— 1868. 1869. 1870. October . 8 January 4 July 6 January 13 February August 15 November 11 March 4 September 21 February 7 April 11 October 13 December 4 May 7 November 16 March 11 June 10 December 14 It is singular that the mortality is much higher in boys: out of 102 cases, 64 are boys, 38 girls. I have no means of knowing the exact proportion of fatal cases to the whole number of persons attacked with the disease; but I have been accustomed to believe that about one death happens in every ten eases of the disease. My Colleague in Marylebone, 9 Dr. Whitmore, estimates the fatal cases much higher. According to my estimate of persons attacked, there would have been one thousand seven hundred and fifty cases of Scarlatina during eighteen months in this Parish, and I have no reason to believe this to be an exaggeration. The largest number of fatal cases are at the ages of above one year and under five years. According to the class of families where this disease has appeared, it seems to have had no special relation, to the conditions of destitution and poverty ; the rich, the middle class, and poor have suffered alike. Sanitary defects in house construction and ventilation, smells and malaria from drains, do not appear to have had any perceptible influence upon the course of this malady. Houses were again and again inspected without either discovering any sanitary defects at all, or such as were common to all or any other dwelling in the same street. One thing only was notably certain, its contagious and spreading character; the disease had either extended itself from one to others in the same house, or was imported into the house from a school, or a house where other cases existed. There was seldom any difficulty in thus tracing the origin of the disease. On the very border of this Parish, but in two adjoining parishes, two instances occurred showing the sad havoc of this disease in large families. In one family five deaths occurred in succession ; in another four ; all were in children supposed to be previously strong and healthy. 10 The following is a list of streets or districts where more than one death has been recorded; those marked0 are in houses where more than one death occurred : — From October 1868, to March 25th, 1870.

Ought the reiterated lessons of former experience to be cast aside? It has been fully proved by the fact and observation that Scarlet Fever is a disease recognised as blood poisoning; a poison received into the constitution giving rise after a certain time to a well marked eruption, and a set of symptoms indicative of efforts on the part of nature to eleminate it. It is true that the particles of the poison have not yet been seen by the most powerful microscope; but persons labouring under their effects have enough of it hanging about them in the skin and secretions, in clothes and bedding, to infect others who come within the range of an atmosphere charged with it. Exact experiments are wanting to complete the demonstration of these familiar facts; but it would not be difficult to obtain proof of them from the hands of a competent observer with time and money at his command. It is indeed one of those duties that ought to be undertaken with public money for the public good. No public body ought to grudge the reasonable expenditure for promoting investigations for the discovery of methods to check the ravages of fever poisons. We learn that by proper methods of isolation, and free ventilation, the poison may be diluted, and by disinfection the further progress of the disease may be arrested from travelling beyond its first seat; but how seldom is that efficiently carried out. There are also mechanical means of diluting the poison: sponging, oiling, bathing and cleansing the surface (Dr. Budd), and the removal of excretions; perhaps also chemical means of destroying it. Condy's liquid undoubtedly destroys the power of fever poisons. Carbolic acid has its influence, but hitherto we have relied too implicitly upon medical treatment, which as far as the administration of drugs 14 go, I may quote the authority of Sir W. Jenner in saying they have been useless; and there is nothing to hope for in that direction. Is it not therefore to preventive, or sanitary medicine, that we ought to turn our attention and seek for better success in checking, preventing and stamping out epidemic maladies? The main sphere of action now depends upon those who are entrusted with the administration of Sanitary Laws and the excellent provisions therein embodied. These laws are unfortunately only permissive and not compulsory in their action, and thus permission generally is interpreted as a permission not to enforce them. Sanitary Works Executed. Sanitary Orders for various works executed during the years, principally by the Owners of property, were as follows:— Consequent upon Consequent upon Systematic Inspection of houses.

The two Companies that supply this district with water, derive their supply from the Thames, at Kingston, where it is found to contain less than 20 grains of solid matter per gallon, and of late years this has been three or four grains reduced by better methods of storage and filtration. In my Report of last year, I mentioned, that by the Thames Conservancy Board having stringent power to prevent pollution, and that the Act extended to the tributaries of the Thames, we have no fear that the future supply should fail to be pure and abundant. In the periodical Analysis of the Register General, Dr. Frankland, has shown that the waters of the two Companies (the West Middlesex and Grand Junction Company) which supply Paddington, were the purest in the metropolis, and this no doubt has been attained by their improved methods of filtration. The Constant Water Supply Act, 15 & 1G Vic. Cap. 84, Sec. 15, contains the following provisions for constant supply:— "Four-fifths of owners "and occupiers on one main, must make a requisition "in writing; one-fifth of the houses on such main "must be supplied with cocks, &c. for the reception and "distribution, to the satisfaction of the company." It is only just that the Company may have the right to enter, and send their Surveyor to examine pipes and cocks, and that with the consent of the Board of Trade, after due notice, where the waste is fraudulently and wilfully neglected, this may suspend the supply. The public have, during the last year, again agitated the question of a constant water supply, and thus seek for fresh legislation. This appears to be scarcely necessary. For while no doubt need be entertained that the present system of storing water in cisterns placed in situations where pure water is readily defiled 16 by gaseous exhalations from the water-closet waste-pipe, or emanations from the dust bin, is highly objectionable, it must be remembered that the public have the remedy much in their own hands. A majority of the public is not prepared for submitting to the conditions which a constant supply would necessitate. Occupiers of houses in streets and districts can at any time avail themselves of this mode of supply by attending to, and going to the expense of proper pipes, cocks and machinery to prevent waste of water. Periodical Examination of Milk sold in Paddington. I have as usual made examinations of milk sold and supplied, both wholesale and retail, in various parts of the Parish. Between thirty and forty specimens have been taken and submitted to tests, showing the percentage of cream, the specific gravity, and the probable amount of dilution with water and other adulterations in them. The occasional examination of milk by Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health has undoubtedly been the means of improving the quality of London milk. Dairy companies and dairies have professed to supply the public with a better quality of milk by bringing it from the country by rail. A keen competition of London cow-keepers has also brought about a better mode of cow feeding. The health of these cows is attended to, so that the quality of London milk may now be favourably compared with that brought from the country to London by railway. The result, after analysis, of specimens, purchased casually from the milk shops by a responsible person, is shown in Tables VIII. and IX. and X. 17 Five specimens were taken from the Great Western Railway Station (from wholesale purveyors), four of which contained seven per cent. of cream, while one contained only two per cent. of cream, the average specific quality being 27. I find the Companies professing to supply pare Milk have no superiority over the best London dairies, and this opinion is borne out by Mr. Chalmers Morton, Dr. Voelcher, and Dr. Whitmore, who all concur, as the result of their examination, that London milk is superior to country milk. "As a rule;, says Dr. Whitmore, "it contains more casein or cheesey matter, and more butter than country milk; it is in fact a mere question of careful and proper feeding." In one of the suburban dairies, Messrs. Welford and Son, Warwick Farm Dairy, I have invariably found in the samples examined a high standard quality of milk, viz.: more than 12 per cent. of cream, the other constituents in the same proportions. Milk containing only six per cent. of cream if compared with this at 12, each costing 4d. per quart, shows the enormous benefit of getting good milk at 4d per quart, rather than milk having six per cent. of cream at less money. Some kinds of milk are worth double in money than others that contain but little of nutritive ingredients. In some recent examinations of London milk by the Medical Times and the British Medical Journal— milk produced by London cow-keepers yielded on an average 10 per cent. of cream, the country yielding 6½ per cent. of cream. Some specimens contained 33 per cent. of diluted water, making them not really worth more than 2½d. per quart. There is moreover some disadvantage in bringing the milk long distances by rail; it must be often 10 or 12 hours old before delivery, and is then kept 8 or 10 hours more before it is consumed. It is to be feared 18 that the faults of old London dairymen are now practised by country farmers, viz.: taking off the cream before sending it up to London, or so managing the feeding that cows produce quantity rather than quality. In carrying the analysis beyond the rough and ready test, I have ascertained by a more complete analysis, as in the table X., (under the direction of Dr. Muter, Analytical Chemist to the Food Journal) what are the proportionate quantities of other nutritive matter, viz.: the butter, casein, or cheesey matter, sugar of milk, and mineral ingredients,— those which give milk its well known value as an article of nutrition either for the infant, invalid, or adult. The tables VIII. & IX. show the result of milk testings, and the quantities supplied to families in poor and rich neighbourhoods. The worst examples are too often found in shops of poor neighbourhoods, thickly populated. It will be seen that the higher class families consume ten times more than is supplied to the working man's family. The working class suffer many disadvantages in their milk supply. Firstly, parents err in not being sufficiently aware of the economy and necessity of a good supply of milk for their young and growing offspring, and too frequently they are ignorant of the various forms in which it may be used as an article of nourishing diet. Dr. Edward Smith, in a Report to the Privy Council, 1864, found the average quantity of milk consumed by each adult in Bethnal Green to be 1½ ounce per week only, and the lower class in Paddington is not at present much more abundantly supplied. Secondly, milk they do provide is too frequently, as shown by table 50, diluted with 30 per cent. of water. There is even a third disadvantage to the poor, that large dairies professing to give genuine milk are not willing to supply the more humble class of customers who consume less 19 TABLE VIII.

XT: n- 21 than a pint per diem. They are thus forced to buy in the worst market. Although it is now no part of the duty of Public Health Officers to regulate cow-keeping and inquire into the health of cows, there are reasonable grounds for instituting more supervision than exists. The effects of over-prolonged lactation upon the secretion of milk are known to be injurious in many ways, by impairing the health of the animal it may give use to grave suspicions that the properties of milk are so far deteriorated as to render it an improper article of diet, and even to communicate and generate disease. The best guarantees we have for the quality and purity of milk, are to purchase it from farms near London, where pure air and good grazing can be assured, and where the milk can be delivered to the consumer as soon as possible after it has been taken from the cows. Public Baths and Laundry. Before we can consistently expect poor persons to carry out Sanitary orders for the cleansing of rooms, bedding and linen, or get the necessary amount of washing done as it ought to be, away from the premises in which they live, it is essential that Public Baths and a Laundry should be accessible. It will be then a question whether "forced ablution" is not a sound principle of Sanitary agency, to be carried out under authority and penalty. In the casual wards, in common lodging houses, and in prisons and lunatic asylums, contagious maladies have no place. In the army and in schools forced ablution is capable of, and is essential to the preservation of large numbers of congregated individuals free from the spreading diseases. There are in this Parish large numbers of men and women engaged in the most dirty of occupations; the dust women at the yards on the Canal basin, carmen 22 and coal porters at the dust and coal wharves, horsekeepers from numerous stables, blacksmiths, engineers, stokers, firemen from the railway — whose garments leave the grime on walls or staircase, as soon as they have been papered by the landlord. How can these persons be expected to keep clean, either their persons, clothing, bedding, linen, blankets, &c.? How can washing, drying, mangling and ironing be done at home in one room? Every drop of water has often to be carried up for personal use, and then the slops, unless they remain all night in the room or adjoining passage, have to be taken down (no sink being provided for the upper rooms). In some houses a wash-house is built with a copper outside the house; in others, it is in the back kitchen, and lodgers take it in turns to do their washing. Great indeed would be the comfort and convenience of being able to have the washing done away from all houses where more than one family reside in the same house. The vapour of steam, the smell of soap-suds, and a general dampness constitute a real nuisance both to landlord and tenant, who ought in self-defence to unite in petitioning the Vestry to put into force the Act of 1844, authorizing the erection of Public Baths and Washhouses. The Public Baths and Washhouses have in almost every instance been successful, have paid out of profits the capital invested, and have never permanently taxed the Rate-payers one farthing. It is a sad spectacle to find in this rich country our working classes often worse housed, and less cleanly, than the soldiers, sailors, criminals, paupers and lunatics. I have in my former Reports alluded to this subject, and cannot but feel that the industrial portion of the community in this wealthy Parish is not well provided for in this respect, and that if some intelligent members of the Vestry will make an appeal for the 23 establishment of Public Baths and Washhouses in the Parish, it would almost unanimously meet with the support it merits. Disinfection under Clauses of Sanitary Act of 1866. In my Report for 1868, I complained that disinfection of houses, clothing, bedding, &c. had not been actively carried out in this Parish, and that owing to the imperfect means of obtaining early information, a judicious and prompt action could seldom be taken to prevent the spread of contagious diseases. In 1869 I intimated to the Vestry, that the time had arrived when increased facilities should be given for personal ablutions and change of linen and clothing by establishing a Public Bath and Laundry, to which should be attached an efficient Disinfecting and Cleansing Apparatus for those who have need of it. Since then, a painful experience has shown the absolute need of putting into force provisions in clauses relating to disinfection in the Act of 1866.* No farther proof is needed than a reference to what has happened within the last 18 months. In the epidemic of Scarlet Fever now prevailing 175 deaths have occurred in this district: representing more than ten times the number of cases of this disease. A single case becomes the focus of the disease, spreading from house to house, not among the poor particularly, but equally penetrating the mansions of the rich, taking off not the sickly and young offspring of delicate parents, but the finest children in the best families, at the most interesting period of their developement. *Sec. 23. The Nuisance Authority in each district may provide a proper place with all necessary apparatus and attendance, for the disinfection of woollen articles, clothing and bedding, which have become infected, and they may cause any article brought for disinfection to be disinfected free of charge, if from poverty, or otherwise, the owner or occupier in the opinion of the Nuisance Authority is unable to carry out the requirements of this Section. 24 In November last, I made a complete Report on this subject, pursuant to the following Resolution of the Sanitary Health Committee:- As to whether adequate means of Disinfecting (with special reference to the provisions of the Sanitary Act of 1866,) exists in this Parish, and, if not, to specify in detail what could be recommended for carrying out measures of Disinfection in an adequate and effectual manner. I will here remark that after more mature experience I have nothing to add or retract on the minute details I then proposed; the manner in which the important subject was treated by the Vestry, by postponing its consideration for six months, is to be regretted, feeling assured, as I do, that this attempt to check contagious diseases would have been successful; while in all probability a self-supporting institution would have met with the approval of Rate-payers. Nothing is more objectionable than the usual obnoxious practice of sending infected linen to a laundress; washwomen may convey contagion to all parts of the town; it is difficult to compel persons to carry out properly disinfection of woollen clothes, carpets, curtains blankets and bedding in their own homes, while, on the contrary, there were many instances where well-to-do persons called at the Vestry Hall, expressing willingness to carry out disinfection, if they could but be informed where to take the infected things. Sanitary authorities should offer every facility for disinfection and cleansing, by providing a suitable place to resort to, and afterwards see that the provisions of the Act are duly carried out, rather than pretend to keep up a staff of officials to do the actual work. It is an unwise policy for any Parochial authority to do for the community what is clearly the duty of individuals themselves to perform. 25 In the instance of the present epidemic of Scarlet Fever, extremely few pauper cases were treated, as shown by the books of the Parochial Medical Officers. The Workshops Regulation Act. I have taken some trouble in endeavouring to discover any neglect in the carrying out of the provisions of this Act. During the past year, inspections have been made of 64 establishments in this Parish where generally more than five young women were employed, principally in millinery and dressmaking. The result of inspections is noted on a form kept for the purpose, which has been approved by the Inspector of Factories. As a rule, the provisions of the Act are fairly attended to, and the hours of labour are not expessive. I have had anonymous and other communications, which have, in every instance, been investigated, but I was not able to prove the accusations made against the proprietors of some of the shops indicated. In two instances, the proprietors were ordered to increase the cubic space of the work-room; and in two others to remove the young women from the kitchen, which had improperly been used as the work-room. Since writing the above, I received information and obtained a conviction, under the Act, for keeping girls illegally at over work in the night, on Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning. Mrs. Marian Pridham, of Tankerville House, Queen's Road, Bayswater, was summoned before Mr. Mansfield, upon satisfactory evidence she was found guilty in two instances and fined £6 penalty for the offences. In this case the health of one young lady was affected by over-hours at night work. According to my inspections, more than 500 dressmaking young women are employed, but there are undoubtedly in establishments near Westbourne Grove vast numbers still not brought under notice, from not knowing the private residences of many who employ young persons in dressmaking. 26 The Adulteration of Food. A Bill, brought before Parliament, proposing to amend the former Act of 1862, was withdrawn in the month of May; it contemplated making compulsory on local authorities to nominate an officer as public analyst, whose duty it would be to inspect and report upon the quality of articles used as food, and drugs exposed for sale within his district. It is at present no part of my official appointment to carry out systematically the duties of such an office, but recognising as I do its importance as one of the functions of a true officer of health, I have ventured to make some investigations for my own private satisfaction. Besides the examinations of milk, on a large scale, as shown in this Report, which I have been accustomed to make annually for the last three years, this year I have examined the following articles in every day use: butter, lard, tea,* a few samples of coffee, some specimens of confectionery, and two samples of whisky. The slightest reflection and experience goes to show that a public officer entrusted with real powers to check these frauds, might exercise great influence upon the commercial morality of a neighbourhood, and at the same time render valuable service to the public health. The loss of even a few pence daily in articles of food purchased by the wages of a working man has a cruel effect upon him as the bread-winner for his family. He is either defrauded in quantity got for his money, or he must work harder to get *In February last, Dr. Letheby exposed the frauds going on in the sale of tea at bonded warehouses in the City. He found chests of re-dried leaves of exhausted tea, containing but a trace of the active principles of tea. In England this tea has gone by the name of "Fine Moning Congou; but at Shanghai it was called Maloo mixture, from the name of the Street, where we are informed that heaps of it may be seen drying in the sun, dogs and pigs walking through it, and that thousands of packages oi this spurious stull are shipped over to foreign countries. 27 enough money to purchase the full quantity; working harder, means taking more food or losing strength. What generally happens with the hard-working artizan is this, his own strength is kept up, come what may; the wife and children often fall short, or suffer from inferior qualities of food. With regard to the new "Adulteration of Food. Bill;" there are great defects in it. The fines are much too high for obtaining convictions without legal difficulty. The penalty appears to depend upon adulteration of articles of food with substances injurious to health. Milk therefore can be adulterated by water with impunity; arrowroot and flour can be used largely, as they now are, for adulterating lard, cocoa, &c. Wine, beer and spirits, being excisable articles, are exempted; tobacco being neither food, nor drugs, nor poison, is not inclucled in the Bill, and is sold largely adulterated. Neither can defects with regard to fraudulent weights and measures be taken cognizance of, as they ought to have been in a properly constituted Act. Meat, Fish, and Fruit destroyed. A barrel and two pounds of plaice and whiting were seized and condemned; one barrel of sprats; halfa leg of mutton and two mutton chops. Complaints were lodged against eight persons; in most instances they returned the purchase money to those who had bought meat unfit for food. Fruit shops and costermonger's stalls are watched; and the proprietors warned against selling bad fruit. The Dead-house or Mortuary Register. The number of bodies brought in the Dead-house in Manor Place during the year was 38. Inquests were held on 28; of these, post-mortem examinations were made in the Dead-house in 25 cases. 28 The Fever Ambulance. During the past year four small-pox patients were removed to the Small Pox Hospital at Highgate; and five cases of Fever were sent to the Fever Hospital at Islington, at an expense of £14: 10s. "Why should industrious, prosperous and wealthy communities see their people perish year after year at appalling rates, without trying some radical and effectual measures of reform? This is not a question of mere opinion, but of life and death; it is not a question of a day, but of all time. Shall the town breeds degenerate and die out, or improve and live? There appears to be disputes as to particular measures to be adopted; Why should not experiments be made in various blocks of houses? The water supply is an excellent preliminary, but the houses must follow. The refuse must be day by day removed from the dwellings, and this the householder cannot accomplish in large towns.

Systematic Sanitary Inspection of Streets during the quarter enables me to present complete details of a group of streets in the neighbourhood of Moscow Road. In some of these houses a large number of families live; several instances of overcrowding have been abated within the last year by simple notice, or a threat of proceedings under the powers of the Nuisances Removal Act. The result of systematic Sanitary Inspection enables me to add the following record of Streets and Places to the list published in former Reports:— Streets Inspected Systematically.

On the 16th of April a Committee was appointed, of which Mr. Greatorex was the Chairman, to discuss the question of opening the old closed Burial Ground. It was recommended to the Vestry to improve, plant, and open the place to the public. The populous neighbourhood of the Hall Park Estate, comprising several streets, would be materially benefitted by having a public thoroughfare at the North-West corner, which is unfortunately kept closed. It was further resolved by the Committee, that in any plan for opening the old Church Yard, a scheme for erecting, under the powers of the Sanitary Act of 1866, a Public Mortuary and Dead House, should be comprehended, and placed there, and under the management of a proper person, having for the time being the care of Paddington Green, and that such a person be required to live contiguous thereto. I have constantly expressed my opinion that a Public Mortuary has become a necessity for this parish, and have reported fully as to its management, and the circumstances which frequently come before the Coroner, showing the necessity of some responsible person having the custody of bodies placed in a public mortuary. I feel confident that no better place could be found than the North end of the Church Yard. The Alleged Deficiency of Water Supply. In some of the densely-populated houses in streets leading out of Harrow Road, the water supply has been found occasionally to run short on Sundays and Mondays. I was instructed to write to the Grand Junction Water Works Company, and make application for a supply at such a time as would enable the occupiers of these houses to avail themselves of water at any early hour on Monday. The turncock now gives the supply late on Saturday night, so that no deficiency shall occur on the Sunday or Monday, it being evidently those days when the ordinary supply is insufficient for the additional personal ablution, house cleaning, and family washing of linen, which at this time of the week is in greatest demand, and for which the usual quantity in the cistern is not enough. Public baths and washhouses are much needed for a very numerous class of persons, belonging to the artizan class,who live in this locality. Stokers, engine drivers, smiths, coal porters, and other men, whose occupations are such, that personal ablution at home in the living room, which also serves as a bed-room, becomes impossible. The washing and drying of their garments at home is a real nuisance, and can only be abated by establishing a Public Laundry, open to all. 8 Examples of Over-crowding in Newly-built Houses. The houses in Amberly Road, although all newly-built and tolerably spacious, having eight good-sized rooms, two on each floor—ventilation well provided for back and front, cleanliness, good drainage, water supply, and closet in fair order, yet from several families living in a house generally intended for one— we find the worst evil of over-crowding—viz.: spreading of contagious disease. Here are examples :—No. 33.—A clean house, cases of typhoid have occurred—perhaps from sewer gas finding its way through the waste pipe. No. 47. —Three cases of Scarlet Fever, one death of late, and several cases of illness since it first became inhabited—eighteen months' ago. No. 35.—This is a double house, fair to look at outside, but a perfect pest-house within. The closet is out of order from bad fittings at first. Here have been cases of fever and other illnesses; now we find four of Scarlet Fever. Population:—Kitchen; man, wife and three children ; Parlor or ground floor; man, wife and four children, living principally in the one room; man, wife and two children in another; man and wife in another. First floor; man, wife and three children in one room; woman and three children in one large room; two men lodgers in another; two females and three children have two rooms. Second floor ; a man, wife and four children in two rooms; a man, wife and child in two other rooms. Number of rooms, 15; number of persons, 40. Cubic space for each individual varies from 160 to 300 cubic feet. No. 22.—In the lower rooms; kitchen— front, man, wife and two children; back, a woman and child; the death from Scarlet Fever is in the back room ; no other illness at present in this house, which is clean throughout. Here is another instance:—No. 12, Desboro' Street, eighteen persons in six small rooms; perfectly clean; two cases of Scarlet Fever occurred in this house. Five holdings or distinct lodgers. In parlor floor; man, wife and five children; occupy the two rooms; first floor; man, wife and three children in one room; man, wife and child in the back room ; second floor; two sets of lodgers, but four persons only in all.

The number is 13 less than the corresponding quarter of last year. The births in the same period were 635, being 200 in excess of deaths. The rate of mortality is only 16.8 per 1000, assuming that the same rate of increase in population has been going on. Some allowance, however, must be made for the demolition of houses for the Metropolitan Railway Works. The deaths from Zymotic diseases were 97 or 22.2 per cent of the total deaths. In young children under 5 years of age 195 deaths are recorded, or 44.7 per cent of the total mortality. 43 deaths from Diarrhoea were recorded, chiefly in very young children; almost half the amount of the corresponding quarter in 1868. Scarlatina was fatal this quarter to 36 children, varying in age from 1 to 8 years. The average annual mortality 2 has for 3 years from Scarlet Fever been 56, 31, 46; but during the last 12 months, 98 deaths have occurred This is double the normal amount, and the weekly numbers continue to increase rather than diminish; a fact suggestive of whatever means can be taken to prevent a further extension of this very contagious malady. It appears to have been very fatal in the houses and streets in (see Table V.) Harrow Road and North Wharf Road Districts, but by no means confined to the lower class of dwellings in this District. Whenever information has been obtained sufficiently early as to the seat of this disease, or a death has been recorded from this cause, the house was visited, and disinfection ordered forthwith, if not previously done. Disinfection and Flushing of Sewers and Gullies. Foul effluvia from the Sewers in Hereford Road have been much complained of, four of the gullies were therefore trapped, but during dry weather smells still escape through these openings here, as well as in many other parts. In the month of August, sewers and gullies were extensively flushed throughout the Parish with dilute Carbolic Acid. Improvements have been suggested for the flushing of the public urinal in Uxbridge Road, were the smell was a nuisance to the persons opposite. The usual number of Sanitary Orders and Works have been completed. TABLE II. Deaths from Zymotic and other Diseases during 13 weeks ending September 25th, 1869. Weeks, ending Small-Pox. Measles.

The following notes are supplementary to the information given in above table:— 1. These houses are inhabited principally by persons engaged on the dust wharves, very dirty and poor. 5. Several cases of scarlet fever have occurred here lately, formerly there was small-pox. Great improvement have been effected in them by sanitary works. Overcrowding also abated. 2 & 3. These houses are getting very dilapidated, some are over-crowded, and the people very dirty. 4. There has been a good deal of illness here at times, leas lately—the houses are overcrowed, people improvident. Many pauper cases have been treated here by the Parochial Medical Officers. 7 The Canal Basin. In consequence of the very imperfect manner in which the cleansing of the Canal Basin was performed in May last, and with a view of suggesting better arrangements for the future, I wrote to the Secretary of the Company, enclosing a copy of my Special Report made in July 1868. As a large number of persons are interested in knowing what was done, and what further steps should be taken to abate this long standing nuisance, I would ask them to refer to that document which contains four special recommendations for preventing the recurrence of so dangerous a nuisance in the centre of a populous district. So inefficient was the cleansing in May, that in four weeks after the operation, the water began to show signs of putrifactive fermentation. The following are the four recommendations alluded to, which I am prepared to insist upon for the effectual abatement of the Canal Nuisance:— 1. The Board of Works must withdraw the restriction they now place upon the Company draining water from the canal, , and give permission to drain into the sewers in the ordinary manner, with proper precautions. The necessity for making timely and effectual arrangements for the protection of the lives of men working in the main sewers was the original ground for demanding 72 hours notice from the engineer of the Canal Company. Such a notice is unreasonable, and it is doubtful whether any danger would arise from any efflux of water into the sewers from the canal even if no notice at all were given— for a sudden storm will let more water into the sewers in a short space of time, and causes greater danger, if any, while it is found practically that the men have ample time to take care of themselves. 2. The second recommendation was enforcement of ByeLaws, by which all persons who wilfully or carelessly neglect, shall be subject to a penalty. The Canal Conpany have in their own hands means of preventing evils which the Sanitary Committee are perpetually struggling to remedy. An efficient Water Baliff should be appointed; he would have a marvellous effect in a short time in checking many of the present mal-practices with regard to loading, in preventing those accumulations and detentions of offensive matters, and reckless loading on the wharves, which cause nearly all the mischief. This has been done to some extent this year. 3. A third recommendation which the Sanitary Committee ask to be carried out by the Company, is an increased watercloset and urinal accommodation for the numerous men, women 8 and families employed both on the wharves, and living on the barges. This has been effectually done. 4. A fourth recommendation consists in the adoption of a more regular and systematic plan of cleansing once or twice a year. Cleansing once a year would probably be satisfactory, if other precautions and suggestions were carried out, and the cleansing operations were done in a more complete manner, viz., in accordance with the following suggestions;—It is quite practicable to let off the water from the basin during the night, to fill the barges with mud, which in a few hours will be ready for loading ; the boats can be filled and made ready for floating off in the afternoon, when the water could be let in to take them away. With a proper and viligant arrangement beforehand, this has been, and can at any future time be accomplished. The practice of partly loading a few barges, and of throwing np the remainder of the putrid mud on the wharves or bank is highly objectionable, and ought not to be permitted in hot weather. It not only calls for much additional labour, but the offensive mud lying some days exposed to the sun on the banks until the owners of each wharf can take it away, is a dangerous practice, and altogether unnecessary. Between 30 and 40 barges are required to be in readiness, moored over night in the middle of the Canal, and a gang of men, will in a few hours load all the mud within range of them. One perfect cleansing would make much easier, and quicken all future operations. From want of these preconcerted arrangements, the letting off and refilling of the Canal, has on several former occasions been inconvenient, ineffectual and dangerous. Such precautions and arrangements for the work to be done speedily, will render less necessary any process of deodorization, that would otherwise be safer to adopt in the hot months of summer.

The births are 726, or 28.8 per 1000. The Zymotic diseases were fatal to 94 persons, chiefly young children; Small Pox 1, Measles 9, Scarlet Fever 44; Hooping Cough 1, Fever 8, Diarrhoea 16. The epidemic of Scarlet Fever has been severe in most parts of London, and still prevails here. The Tubercular diseases 75, (including 46 cases of Consumption) are rather lower than the average. Inflammatory Diseases of the Chest, Bronchitis, Pneumonia and Pleurisy did not reach their usual weekly average ; 59 only during the quarter have been recorded. The deaths in young children (102) are also lower than usual; showing throughout the quarter (except from Scarlet Fever) a very favorable state of the public health. 2 Nuisances and Complaints. The register book of complaints and nuisances contains 123 cases, which admit of the following classification :— Defects of drainage and untrapped gulleys. 16 „ „ water supply 4 Dirty state of premises, water closets, urinals, stagnant water, percolations, &c 17 Offensive trades, marine stores, frying of fish, ammoniacal liquor, bad meat, &c 1 Overcrowding and bad ventilation 1 The state of the dead house 26 visits. Smoke nuisances 0 Animals being kept, and noises from 2 Smells from the Canal Basin 0 Accumulation and deposit of manure, garbage, refuse, dust, dung, &c 39 Smells from decaying substances 7 Miscellaneous other complaints 10 123 Arrest of Fever, &c. In November, the Medical Officer of the Privy Council issued a Circular, inquiring what steps were taken in this Parish for carrying out the Disinfection Clauses of the Sanitary Act of 1866, as a means of arresting the progress of fever, prevailing in most parts of the Metropolis. In reply, the Lords of the Privy Council were informed that no cases had occurred in this Parish, and that in the event of fever or any epidemic arising, the Sanitary Committee were prepared to recommend to the Vestry the adoption of Clause 10 of the Sanitary Amendment Act. Out-Patient Department of Hospitals and Dispensaries. In December I prepared a Report on the Ventilation and accommodation for Out-Patients in the Hospitals, Dispensaries, and Workhouse of this Parish, with a view more particularly of ascertaining what risk, if any, exists of propagating contagious diseases from patients in the waiting rooms. Some alterations and improvements in the rooms were effected in consequence of this inquiry. The Sanitary Committee therefore decided not to take further action upon the matter. 3 TABLE II.

Sanitary Orders are numerous, indicative of grave defects and neglect; but it will be observed that the average cubic space is not up to the mark of what would be considered over-crowding. When epidemic maladies have been from time to time recorded in the books of the Parochial Medical Officers, inspection has been made forthwith, and the necessary orders given for disinfection. 7 Sanitary Inspection of Dwellings. Systematic Sanitary inspection has been carried on during the quarter in the following places :—Polygon Mews, Stanley, Alexander, Lanark, and some other Mewses. Completed returns of several highly populated streets can now be added to those already published in my Quarterly Reports. North Wharf Road, Iron Gate Wharf, Carlton and Andover Place, in Table VI., are the worst conditioned places in the Parish of Paddington, and are constantly under sanitary inspection. A Public Disinfecting Establishment. On the 13th of November, the Sanitary and Public Health Committee directed me to report in detail the steps necessary for carrying out Disinfection in this Parish in an adequate and effectual manner. I refer to that report, which enters most fully into the subject, showing urgent need of a public disinfecting establishment, and the probablity is of it being a self-supporting institution in this wealthy and populous Parish. The deaths from scarlet fever alone during the last 4 years have been 268, representing about ten times the actual cases of disease, scarcely any one of which, whether in the house of rich or poor, have had the opportunity of properly effecting the disinfection of woollen clothes, curtains, blankets, carpets and bedding which retain the contagion. Is it therefore surprising that the epidemic continues to extend ? Persons are willing and anxious to pay for this accommodation. Sanitary Authorities do not pretend to carry out this kind of work for the people, inasmuch as, first, they known not of the whereabouts of the fresh cases as they appear ; secondly, if they did, the proper responsibility lies with the persons themselves, except in eases of poverty, where powers are given to execute the duty. The • consideration of the subject was postponed for six months. Uses of Trees in Towns. I was requested to report upon the alleged nuisance of trees overhanging the street in Victoria Place, Talbot Road. Amongst the minor nuisances complained of, were those of obstruction to light in some windows, and to gutters and gullies by falling leaves in Autumn. The benefit, however, of their shade in keeping rooms cool in summer, and above all, the purification of air by absorbing carbonic acid and exhaling pure oxygen, far out-weigh any little inconvenience. I consider that trees in towns ought to be better protected and cared for by public authority. The Committee did not sanction the removal of the trees. 8 Opening of St. Mary's Church-yard. A Committee, of which Mr. Greatorex is Chairman, was appointed in April, reported that they consider a Public Mortuary a necessary acquisition to this Parish, and that the most appropriate site exists at the North End of the Burial Ground, proposed to be opened to the Public. That the keys of the Public Mortuary, or of the present dead house, and of the Burial Ground, should be kept exclusively by a man in charge of the Burial Ground, whose duties would require him to be always on the spot, and he should be required to live contiguous thereto. The Committee are of opinion that in order to render this improvement readily accessible to all parts of the Parish, a thoroughfare should be made into Cuthbert Street, Hall Park, from Manor Place, by taking down two houses at the end of Manor Place.

The births Avere 718. The deaths are more than 100 in excess of the usual amount. The deaths from epidemic diseases were 92, or 16.0 per cent, of the whole deaths, being an average of the three last quarters and not in excess of former ones. Ten deaths were from measles, 31 from scarlet fever, 22 from whooping cough, 11 from diarrhoea, 16 from fever. This last item requires explanation : it includes deaths returned as : gastric fever 3 ; brain fever 2 ; nervous fever 1 ; typhoid fever 8. I believe there are no true cases of typhus. The typhoid are doubtful and complicated with other diseases.
