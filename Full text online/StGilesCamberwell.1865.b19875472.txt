CAMBER WELL: PRINTED BY E. BILLING AND SON, COTTAGE GREEN. 1866. TENTH ANNUAL BEPORT of the Vestry of the Parish of St. Giles, Camberwell. In conformity with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, the Vestry of the said Parish submit to the Parishioners a statement of their proceedings in the execution of the various powers vested in them. And an Account of their Eeceipts and Expenditure for the year ending 25th March, 1866. SURVEYOR'S REPORT. 1865-6. To the Yestry of St. Giles, Camberwell. Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you the account of Works executed (during the past financial year) under my directio:- GENERAL PURPOSES. HIGHWAYS. The general maintenance of the Local Roads under the Vestry's control, have been carried out in the usual manner, and as reported upon by me from time to time; but as suggestions have been made in the Vestry, as to alterations in the system of conducting these Repairs, I beg to say I shall have pleasure in giving them full consideration, as 4 well as to introduce some few alterations which have occurred to my observation, This matter being about to receive the special attention of the General Purposes Committee, I need not at present further dilate upon. The late Turn Pike Roads (within this Parish) fell under the Vestry's control in November last, Contracts for their repair, &c. were entered into, which contracts extend to Machaelmas next. The continued wet weather of the last Winter, necessitated a large amount of labour and material thereon; but from the circumstance that the whole of the Turnpike Eoads in the Southern portion of the Metropolis lapsed into a new control at the same time, the demand for material for repairs became so great, that the proper supply could not be procured when most required, aud the limited quantity when obtained, was procurable only at an advanced price ; for this reason, I have found it necessary to continue the repair of these roads during the Summer season to a greater extent than I had anticipated, the necessity being also increased from the fact now ascertained, that the crust of wearing material upon these Roads has been only supplied from time to time, according to actual necessity, and which the wear and tear of a 5 few months traffic and slopping, almost wholly removes. I think it proper to state, that to efficiently prepare these roads for general traffic, and for eventual periodical repairs only, a thorough coating of material on their entire surface would be most economical in the end, and although I do not presume to ask for the increased funds which would be required for this purpose, I do fear that it may be found necessary to extend these repairs, and increase the expenditure of material beyond that which was anticipated in the provision for that porpose. Much of this anticipated increase will depend upon the state of the weather of the ensuing Winter. I would earnestly suggest that our contracts for road material, be issued early, so that a supply for the coming season may be stored ready for use, and that an uniform supply should (in addition thereto) be exacted by the the terms of the new contract from the party whose tender may be accepted. / The Vestry has been moved to take under its consideration the expediency of contracting for a term of years for the entire work of repairing, cleansing and watering the main thoroughfares. Although I have reported my opinion contrary to 6 this desire, I beg to say, that should the Vestry decide to try the experiment, I shall be only too happy to endeavour to frame a contract to meet these requirements, and to give full effect thereto ; but I am still of opinion, that the present arrangements are the best suited to the proper execution of these Eoad repairs. It may be interesting and useful also to provide the Yestry with some particulars relating to the expenditure of material, &c. on these Roads, for which purpose I append the following:— From 1st November, 1865, to Lady-day, 1866 (= 5 months only)— 2069 Cube yards of Granite. 218 Ditto Flints. Before leaving this portion of my Report, I would beg to direct the attention of the Yestry to the great expense of repairing main Roads of heavy traffic with broken stone, as laid down under the present system, the constant removal of material, labour of cleansing, and cost of removal of slop, leads me to anticipate at no very distant date, the adoption of pitched paving for those portions of our public thoroughfares, as by their incidental position are subjected to very heavy wear and tear. 7 NEW KOADS. The following are the New Roads and Streets which have been repaired and adopted by the Vestry during the past year:- (Total number of Streets taken are 12.) viz.:— Length. Atwell road 175 yards. Nunhead grove 345 „ North street 70 „ Wood crescent road 533 „ College street and 190 ,, Fowler street Gloucester place, Old Kent road 75 „ Albert grove 200 „ Choumert grove 130 „ South street 140 „ Bedford street and 270 „ Norfolk street 2128 yards. 8 A number of other roads are now under notice to repair in a similar manner to the above. IMPROVEMENTS. The widening of Wells Street (adjacent to), and rendered necessary by the re-building of St. George's Bridge, by the setting back of the railings of St. George's Church, has been carried out by the V estry. PAYING WOEKS. New Paving "Work has been executed from Church Street, around the enclosure of Catnbervvell Green (on the south and eastern sides) to the " Red Cap " public-house. NEW KIRBING. The usual amount of Kirbing has been laid down as provided for in the several wards, amounting during the past year to about 18,000 feet. Also,' the completion of the Kirbing and Chan. 9 nelling of Camberwell Grove, and Gravelling the footpaths throughout. RE-NUMBERING STREETS. The following thoroughfares have been re-numbered under directions from the Metropolitan Board of Works:— Neate street Avenue road. Several other Roads have been submitted to the consideration of the Metropolitan Board of Works for the above purpose. RAILWAYS, &c. Plans were deposited in November last, for the consideration of Parliament in the forthcoming Session, of a number of Branch Lines from the existing Railways, and also of some new lines, all of which were either wholly withdrawn, or failed to comply with the standing orders of Parliament. I may, I think, be here permitted to remark upon the continuous sacrifice of the time of the officers of the Yestry consequent upon these Railway projects, which after all the consideration necessarily devoted 10 to them, generally ends in the withdrawal or defeat of the various schemes. In the case of the London, Chatham and Dover (Peckham Line), after much opposition and time occupied in attendance upon Parliamentary Committee, this Act was extended for twelve months, in regard to its purchasing powers only, but no extension was granted for its ultimate completion, viz. August, 18C8. LIGHTING.

In the above list of Roads and Stre 'ts is included the Sewers Works which were provided for in the Loan of £13,000. A perusal of the foregoing list of Sewerage Works, will afford ample proof that the Vestry has been neither negligent or dilatory in the performance of one of its most important duties. Last year's Report, announced the execution of New Sewers Works on the High Level, this Year's Report announces the completion of a large section 15 (Block 4) of the Loiv Level Sewerage, and at the time of the compilation of these remarks, two other Blocks, viz. Nos. 3 and 5 are well on towards completion of an additional 12 miles of Sewers Work, and also a part of Block No. 6, eventuating a further outlay of nearly £40,000 The important share I have in carrying out these Works, is I assure you, to me, a matter of much laudable pride; the approbation of the Vestry thereon has lately been expressed to me in a manner which I beg to be permitted to take this opportunity to acknowledge, and also to express a hope that I may continue to retain the confidence of the Vestry, which I feel it is my good fortune to have secured. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. C. REYNOLDS, Surveyor. Office of Works, Wells Street, Southampton Street, Camberwell. 1866'. 1865-6. MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. ANNUAL REPORT BY J. S. Bristowe, M.D., Land., Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, Physician to St. Thomas's Hospital. Gentlemen, The year 1865 was, upon the whole, a tolerably healthy year. The deaths in London were 4263 less than they were in 1864, while the births had increased by 4535; and the mortuary rate was 2.462 per cent.: the rate for 1864 having been 2.653. Further, although in that year (as compared with 1864) deaths from diarrhoea rose from 2861 to 3577, deaths from cholera from 154 to 193, deaths from hooping cough from 2386 to 2921, and deaths from small-pox from 537 to 646 ; deaths from measles sunk from 2750 to 1302, deaths from scarlet fever from 3242 to 2181, deaths from diphtheria from 564 to 433, and deaths from fever from 3689 to 3232. It is satisfactory to find that the Southern districts were still, as has been usually the case of late years, amongst the most favoured of the Metropolitan districts. Their Mortality was less in proportion to population than that of any of the other groups of Metropolitan districts with 20 the single exception of the Western group, and less than that of London as a whole. The respective mortuary rates, according to the Registrar General, were as follows:— London 2.462; West districts 2.301; North districts 2.454; Central districts 2.697; Eastern districts 2.644, and Southern districts 2.323. If now we come to the examination of our own parish, we find there an at least equally satisfactory state of health We find, as regards zymotic diseases, that although, since 1864, deaths from measles have increased from 29 to 39, and deaths from small-pox from 10 to 12; deaths from diphtheria have sunk from 16 to 14, deaths from hooping cough from 61 to 52, deaths from scarlet fever from 83 to 55, and deaths from fever from 51 to 31. And we find further that, although a larger total number of deaths occurred in 1865 than in 1864 (1907 in the former year, and 1843 in the latter year) the increase was no more than can be fairly accounted for by increase of population. I have pointed out in former reports how difficult it is to estimate the population of the several out-lying, semirural districts of the Metropolis, and that the calculation of their death-rates is therefore liable to grave error. I have given on former occasions, and I give now, three different estimates of the population of this parish, one founded on the rate of increase, between the years 1851 and 1861, of the Southern districts of the Metropolis; the second founded on the rate of increase, between the same dates, of Camberwell itself; the third founded on the number of births which took place in the year 1865. The 21 estimates are widely different. According to the first, the population of the parish was, in the middle of the year, 78,734; according to the second, 80,837; according to the third, 91,500. And the mortuary rates calculated on these several estimates of population, are respectively 2.42, 2 36 and 2.08 per cent. Now even the first of these deathrates, it will be seen, is less than that of either London, or of its Northern, Central or Eastern districts; while the last of them is far below that of either the Southern or the Western group. The actual death-rate lies somewhere, I have no doubt, between these extremes: nearer the last, however, than the first. The total number of deaths registered in the 52 weeks of 1865 was 1907, of which 960 were of males, 947 of females; and of which 31 occurred in Dulwich, 649 in Camberwell, 706 in Peckham and 521 in St. George's. Of the 649 returned from Camberwell proper, 120 occurred in the workhouse and 80 in the lunatic asylums; and since these 200 deaths are included by a kind of accident only in the return of the Camberwell sub-district, they should be deducted from that return, in comparing the health of this sub-district with that of the other sub-districts; but since, again, these deaths are chiefly parochial deaths, their entire subtraction would render the Camberwell returns unfairly favourable as compared with those of other Metropolitan districts. To avoid the latter unfairness, I have divided the 200 deaths proportionately among the several subdistricts of the parish; and supply the following amended statement of their mortality:— 22 Dulwich 35, Camberwell 501,Peckam 789, St. George's 582. The difficulty of estimating with any degree of accuracy the populations, and the death-rates, of the sub-districts of the Parish is much greater than that of giving similar estimates in regard to the parish at large. I have, however, made three separate estimates of population and of death-rate founded on the same data as those which I have employed above. According to the first estimate, the populations and death-rates of the sub-districts were, for the year 1865, as follows:— Dulwich. Camberwell. Peckham. St. George's. Population 1898 23,456 30,987 22,393 Death-rate 1.84 2.14 2.55 2.59 according to the second:— Population 1763 23,113 33,478 22,780 Death-rate 1.99 2.17 2.36 2.55 according to the third:— Population 1476 23,839 35,382 30,801 Death-rate 2.37 2.10 2.23 1.89 I may add my belief (without assigning my reasons for it, excepting so far as they may be deduced from the observations on the subject made in my last year's Report) that the mortuary rate of Dulwich was really smaller than 23 either of those assigned to it in the above list; that that of Camberwell is fairly represented by any one of the three; and that those of Peckham and St George's are not improbably the means of the last two estimates for each sub-district respectively: in other words, that the death-rate of Peckham was not improbably about 2.3, and that of St. George's about 2.2 per cent. If the views just expressed be correct, the death-rates of the sub-districts, like that of the whole parish, are on the whole highly satisfactory. Yet an analysis of the rates seems to show that Peckham has been somewhat less healthy than the other parts of the parish: for zymotic diseases have prevailed in a somewhat higher degree here than elsewhere, and the mortality of children under 5 years of age has been very considerable. Thus, measles caused 9 deaths in Camberwell, 14 in Peckham and 16 in St. George's; hooping cough 15 in Camberwell, 24 in Peckham and 13 in St. George's; scarlet fever 10 in Camberwell, 28 in Peckham and 17 in St. George's; fever 9 in Camberwell, 12 in Peckham and 10 in St. George's; small-pox 5 in Camberwell and 7 in Peckham; and further, while 215 children under 5 years of age died in Camberwell, and 240 in St. George's, the number that died in Peckham was 345. The number of children born in the year was 3036; of whom 1558 were boys, 1478 girls; and of whom 49 were bora in Dulwich, 791 in Camberwell, 1174 in Peckham, and 1022 in St George's. The year 1865 was in many respects a remarkable 24 year; it was on the whole a year of excessive heat, it was a year too in which we seemed to be threatened with epidemics from various quarters. During the spring, the public was alarmed with rumours of an outbreak of the Siberian plague, as it was called, in St. Petersburg, and of its advance towards this country ; it was alarmed also, at the same time, with the reported prevalence of a peculiar epidemic disease at Dantzic and in neighbouring situations, which was called epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis; cholera, again, which had been imported into Europe by Pilgrims from the East, raged more or less over the whole basin of the Mediterranean, subsequently penetrated into the interior of France, and of some other continental nations, and in the autumn, invaded Southampton, and appeared also in the neighbourhood of Epping; lastly, towards the end of June, there was suddenly imported into the Metropolitan Cattle Market, and thence distributed over the country, a disease of remarkable virulence, now known as the Cattle Plague, which had not been seen in this country for a century, but the possible introduction of which had been foretold both by Professor Simonds and Professor Gamgee. As regards the (so called) Russian Plague; this, on investigation under the direction of the Medical Department of the Privy Council, turned out to be simply the prevalence in St. Petersburgh of two diseases: the one typhus fever, already prevalent in this metropolis: the other, relapsing fever, a fever of low mortality, arising out of famine, and little likely to be dangerous even if introduced into this country. As regards the cerebro- 25 spinal meningitis, which was also investigated in the locality of its prevalence by order of the Privy Council, I must speak guardedly; the disease seems to have been known in the valley of the Vistula off and on for some time, but as an epidemic or endemic disease has never appeared in this country; and there appeared then, and appears still, but little danger of its introduction among us. We had much more reason to fear an invasion of cholera, although from the unusual route the disease took throughout Europe, or perhaps rather from its uncertain course, there seemed some ground for hoping we might escape it. The appearance, however, of the disease in an unquestionable form, during the autumn, both in Southampton and at Epping, proved that the poison of the disease had found its way into this country, and made it exceedingly probable that there would be an epidemic outbreak in the autumn of the present year. I may mention that, during the autumn of last year, there was in the Metropolis, and also in our own parish, an unusual prevalence of diarrhoea. There is, however, little doubt that this was due to the exceptional heat of weather alone, and in no degree to the presence of the true choleraic poison. Of the cattle-plague, I need perhaps scarcely speak. The disease, which has a considerable resemblance to human small-pox, but which is by no means identical with it, is one of the most virulently contagious diseases with which we are acquainted, and one of the most fatal. No precautions were taken to arrest its course, notwithstanding the earnest remonstrances of those Englishmen who were best acquainted with it, such as Professors Simonds and Gamgee. The public was unwilling 26 to believe that the disease was incurable, and veterinary and other charlatans encouraged, either through gross ignorance, or for their own ends, this unbelief; the papers also, with scarcely an exception, took the same side with all the noisy vigour of ignorance and irresponsibility. The disease consequently, instead of being strangled in its infancy as was done on its introduction from this country into Paris, was allowed to spread like wildfire throughout the length and breadth of the land, until thousands of cattle, and millions of property were sacrificed, and dearly bought experience proved even to the editors of journals the truth of those principles which had been the subject of their ridicule. Under the advice of the Commissioners, appointed by Government, precautions have since been taken, which have arrested in great measure the progress of the disease, and which there is reason to believe will ere long bring it to an end. The plague committed great devastation in London, and even in the parish of Camberwell. I may add, that although principally a disease of cattle, it affects (but in a less degree) other ruminants, such as sheep, deer, and goats. Yet notwithstanding these plagues, and rumours of plagues, the year was, as I have already stated it to be essentially a healthy year; the mortality was, as I have pointed out, not high; zymotic diseases were not very fatal; and the epidemics which I have just enumerated, though they threatened, and in some instances, attacked this country, in no case originated here. They were all of foreign origin. 27 I add a list of works executed in my department, chiefly by the labours of your Sanitary Inspectors, during the twelve months which ended on the 31st March, 1866. These works, owing in great measure to the progress of sewerage throughout the parish, have been in some respects considerably more numerous than such works had been during several preceding years. I have continued to examine periodically the gas supplied by the South Metropolitan Gas Company, and to furnish you with the results of my examinations, which so far as they have gone have always been satisfactory. I have continued also, with the valuable assistance of my friend, Dr. Bernays, lecturer on chemistry at St. Thomas's Hospital, to test monthly the waters supplied respectively by the Kent, Southwark and Yauxhall and Lambeth Water Companies, and have generally, up to the time to which this Report relates, found their chemical condition fairly good. I may add that the outbreak of the cattle plague, in the cow-sheds of our parish, threw for a time a considerable amount of extra work on the Inspectors and myself; that, inasmuch as the cow-sheds had been placed under the supervision of the Vestry, and it was a question at first how much the spread of the disease might be due to their insalubriqus condition, and subsequently whether the existence of the plague in them was likely directly or indirectly to affect the health of human beings, it became necessary to examine carefully into their coudition, and to 28 watch the progress of disease in them. Subsequently all responsibility was taken out of our hands, and placed in those of a special department of Government. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant J. S. BRISTOWE. TABLE I.
