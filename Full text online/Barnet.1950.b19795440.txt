Public Health Department, 31 Wood Street, Barnet. To the Chairman and Members of the Barnet Urban District Council. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in presenting to you my Annual Report on the Health of the District for the year 1950. It is drawn up on the lines indicated in Circular 112/50 of the 6th December, 1950 - as requested by the Ministry of Health. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA.

The Council are not the appropriate Local Authority for the purpose of the National Health Service Act, 1946, and do not therefore control any of the Hospitals or ancillary services in the District. Within this District, and under the control of the Barnet Group Hospital Management Committee, are the following:- Barnet General Hospital, Wellhouse Lane, Barnet. (Formerly known as Wellhouse Hospital) 475 Beds. St. Stephen's Hospital, Mays Lane, Barnet. (Female post-operative, Ear, Nose and Throat, and male long-stay cases) 88 Beds. Victoria Maternity Hospital, Wood Street, Barnet. 48 Beds. "Elm Bank", Arkley. (Female long-stay cases) 25 Beds. The following is a list of Clinics etc, available in the District. Tuberculosis Clinics are held daily, by appointment, at Barnet Chest Clinic, Wellhouse Lane, Barnet. At Vale Drive, there is a Minor Ailments Clinic for Schoolchildren every Monday morning, a Speech Therapy Clinic on Wednesdays and Fridays, Child Guidance Clinic on Thursdays and an Eye Clinic on the first, third and fourth Fridays in each month. These Clinics are subject to (4) alteration and it is advisable to enquire of the Vale Drive Clinic (BAR: 6194) for the current days and times. Home Helps Service. The local office of the Herts County Council Home Helps Service at No. 31 Wood Street, Barnet, is open daily from 11 - 12 noon, Monday to Friday inclusive. PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF.

Ø Salary Contribution of one half from Exchequer Grants. x Part-time Officer. WATER SUPPLY. The major area of the District is supplied with water from the mains of the Barnet District Water Company, and the remainder is served by the Colne Valley Water Company. All water supplied by the Barnet District Water Company is chlorinated. A pathological staff is maintained and the water is regularly tested at all stages. During the year, a total of 217 Chemical and 1446 Bacteriological examinations of the water were made by the Company's own staff. The Company submitted some 94 samples for examination by an independent laboratory, all of which were B. Coli. absent in 100 millilitres. Of the Bacteriological samples representative of supply, the percentage of first class (i.e. Coliform organisms absent in 100 millilitres) was 98«9$> which is regarded as quite satisfactory. The Colne Valley Water Company exercises constant supervision, and members of (5) the staff are on duty day and night throughout the year examining samples. All the water supplied by this Company is chlorinated. The water supply is satisfactory both from the Chemical and Bacteriological aspects. The water supply to the whole district is considered adequate, and all houses are supplied by these companies mains. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. The town is drained and sewered on the separate system, excepting the older portions of the district where it is a combined system. The sewage is conveyed to an Irrigation Farm of 56 acres, but before it is turned on the land it is screened and treated by means of detritus and sedimentation tanks, and three rotary filters. Pumping is necessary for three sewers which have their outlets at a low point on the farm. Part of the Totteridge area drains to the Finchley Borough sewers; in the outlying areas some properties are on cesspool drainage or domestic sewage disposal plants, and a few only have pail closets. SANITARY CONDITIONS AND WATER SUPPLY OF SCHOOLS. There are in the district ten schools administered by the South Herts Divisional Education Executive Committee, viz:- Queen Elizabeth's Boys and Girls Grammar Schools; Ravenscroft Secondary School; Fould3 School (Junior Mixed and Infants Departments); Christ Church School (Junior Boys and Girls, and Infants Departments); The Elizabeth Allen Secondary Modern School; Grasvenor Infants School; Underhill School (Junior Mixed and Infants Departments); St. Andrew's Church of England School (Junior Mixed and Infants Departments) and St. Catherine's Roman Catholic School (Junior Mixed and Infants Departments). In my report of last year, reference was made to the proposals which were in hand for the replacement of the last trough closet, by individual water closets, at the Christchurch School, Alston Road, Barnet. During the year, as previously reported to the Council, all trough closets in both branches of this School, i.e. in Alston Road and St. Albans Road, have now been replaced by modern type pedestal water closets. (6) DISPOSAL OF HOUSE REFUSE. The house refuse is collected weekly in covered mechanical conveyances and conveyed to the Council's Sewage Farm, where it is loaded into Contractor's covered lorries and disposed of daily by controlled tipping outside the district. PREVALENCE OF. AND CONTROL OVER. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. The following table shews the number of Notifications to the Sanitary Authority during the year, of each disease specified in the Public Health Act, 1936 and the various Infectious Diseases Regulations, and the number of cases removed to Hospital:- DISEASE NOTIFIED REMOVED TO HOSPITAL Scarlet Fever 38 21 Whooping Cough 193 1 Diphtheria and Membranous Croup Nil Nil Measles 417 10 Acute Pneumonia 15 1 Meningococcal Infection Nil Nil Acute Paralytic Poliomyelitis 4 3 Acute Encephalitis , Nil Nil Dysentery 2 2 Ophthalmia Neonatorum Nil Nil Puerperal Pyrexia 19 19 Smallpox Nil Nil Typhoid 1 1 Food Poisoning 1 1 Erysipelas 4 3 Cholera Nil Nil Typhus Nil Nil Tuberculosis 32 23 TOTALS 726 85 (7) AGE INCIDENCE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE.

The cases of Tuberculosis removed for treatment are usually sent to Clare Hall or Ware Park Sanatoria; other patients with an infectious disease being sent to Coppett's Wood Hospital, Muswell Hill, N.10. The Case Rates, of certain diseases, per 1,000 of the population for the district are as follows, with the rates for England and Wales shewn in parenthesis:- Scarlet Fever 1.52 (1.50); Whooping Cough 7.74 (3.60); Measles 16.73 (8.39); Acute Pneumonia 0.60 (0.70); Acute Paralytic Poliomyelitis 0.16 (0.13); Puerperal Pyrexia (per 1,000 live and still births) 5.62 (5.81); Food Poisoning 0.04 (0.17); Erysipelas 0.16 (0.17). (8) The number of cases of Measles is slightly higher than last year. A minor outbreak which reached its peak in June and continued with sporadic cases over the Summer holidays, suddenly flared up again in November and December. These periods corresponded with the rising figures in the weekly returns for England and Wales, published by the Registrar General, which shewed over 14,000 cases per week in December. Whooping Cough ran on much the same lines but to a lesser degree. The Case Rates indicate that Barnet had more than its share of these two infectious diseases. VACCINATION. No primary or revaccinations were performed by the Medical Officer of Health under the Public Health (Smallpox Prevention) Regulations, 1917• TUBERCULOSIS. NEW CASES AND MORTALITY DURING 1950.

PUBLIC HEALTH ACT. 1936. SECTION 172. COMPULSORY REMOVAL TO HOSPITAL OF CASES OF PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS. No action was necessary under the above Section. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT. 1948. - SECTION 47. No official action has been taken under this Act to secure the removal, to suitable premises, of persons in need of care and attention. MORTAL STATISTICS. Of 242 deaths, 5 occurred under one year of age. The following were the chief causes of death:- Heart Diseases 95> Cancer 41 (17 males and 24 females); Vascular Lesions of nervous system 29; Bronchitis 12; Pneumonia (all forms) 12; Nephritis 3> Tuberculosis 5; Motor vehicle accidents 2; Other accidents 6. SCABIES (PUBLIC HEALTH) NO. 1 ORDER. 1944. Only two cases (one adult and one schoolchild) of Scabies were notified during the year, both being treated at home. Since 1944 when the Order came into force and over 200 patients were treated, there has been a steady decline in the number of cases. It would now appear that this condition, which became prevalent due to war time conditions and overcrowding, is well under control. I am, Yours faithfully, ARTHUR L. HYATT, M.R.C.S.(Eng.), L.R.C.P. ACTING MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. (10) BARNET URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. CHIEF SANITARY INSPECTOR'S REPORT. Public Health Department, 31 Wood Street, Barnet. To the Chairman and Members of the Barnet Urban District Council. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report giving details of the work of the Department during the year 1950 in administering the various Acts, Regulations and Byelaws in force in the district. With the ever rising cost of materials and labour, property owners are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain their houses in a proper state of repair within the economic limits of a pre-war controlled rental. There appears to be little, if any, prospect of adjustment of these controlled rents, and this does have some bearing on the action taken to enforce repairs under the Housing Act, 1936. With the smaller property, in particular, the stage will soon be reached where the only procedure available will be that of Section 11 of the Act, which means demolition of the property if the owner is not prepared to spend an unreasonable amount of money on repairs, having regard to the value of the house, which value is set by the controlled rent and not by any hypothetical vacant possession valuation. Under the present conditions of housing shortage, the demolition of houses, although of great importance from the point of view of the health of the occupants does nothing but aggravate an already serious position. INSPECTION OF DISTRICT. General Inspections of the district have been carried out periodically and all complaints investigated. The process of serving a preliminary or intimation notice upon the person in default, specifying the works necessary to remedy the defects found, is usually followed. It was found necessary to ask your authority to serve only twentyeight Statutory Notices, where persons failed to comply with the preliminary (11) notice, or the strict legal procedure was necessary in the first instance. SANITARY INSPECTION OF AREA. The following is a list of the number and nature of visits and inspections: Visits re: nuisances and sanitary defects 1299 Visits re: infectious diseases 136 Visits and inspections under Petroleum Acts 43 Visits to factories 36 Visits to Outworkers' premises 15 Visits to dairies and milkshops 28 Visits to food manufactories, cafes etc 172 Visits to public halls, cinemas etc 20 Visits re: Overcrowding Survey 101 "Permitted Number" Certificates issued under Housing Act, 1936 60 Visits to inspect meat and other foods 127 Visits to Schools 37 Visits re: pollution of watercourses 70 Visits re: Smoke Nuisances 71 Visits to Tents, Caravans and Sheds 71 Visits under Shops Act 76 Visits re: Animals etc., improperly kept 100 Visits re: Rodent Infestations 1415 Visits re: other infestations 34 Miscellaneous visits 145 NUMBER OF NOTICES SERVED DURING YEAR. Number of Informal Notices 192 Number of Statutory Notices 28 Informal Notices complied with 176 Statutory Notices complied with 20 The Council instituted proceedings,at the Barnet Petty Sessions, against the agents for the owners of four houses to enforce the repairs required by Abatement Notices, served by the Council, under the Public Health Act, 1936, which had not been carried out within the prescribed period. The cases were proved to the satisfaction of the Court, Nuisances Orders being made which were duly complied with. SANITARY WORK AND REPAIRS, The following is a list of repairs effected as a result of informal and formal notices served: Roofs repaired and made weatherproof 38 Gutters, downspouts repaired or renewed 28 Exterior brickwork repaired or repointed 31 Walls, dampness remedied 44 (12) Ohimeny stacks and pots repaired or renewed 12 Yaed syrfaces reoaured or repaved 3 Ceilings repaired or renewed 59 Wall plaster repaired or renewed 53 Walls and ceilings cleansed and decorated 89 Floors repaired or renewed 22 Sub-floor ventilation rectified 12 Doors and frames repaired or renewed 29 Windows repaied 58 Stair treads and balusters repaired 1 Fireplaces repaired or renewed 8 Coopers repaired or renewed 1 Drains cleared 36 Drains repaired or reconstructed 34 Inspection chambers repaired or reconstructed 12 Soil or vent pipes repaired or renewed 6 Gullies, channels and fenders repaired or renewed 34 Sinks,waste pipes repaired or renewed 26 Water closet pans, fittings, repaired or renewed 15 Storage cisterns, cleansed, repaired or renewed 4 Water services, repaired, recewed or re-instated 15 Dustbins renrwed 9 Refuse accumulations removed 2 Animals and fowls:nuisaces from improper keeping 5 HOUSING ACT. 1936. In accordance with Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936, four houses were reported as unfit for human habitation and incapable of repair at a reasonable expense. Two of these are in a long terrace: demolition is impracticable for the time being and the owner has given undertakings that these houses will not be used for human habitation. A Demolition Order was made in respect of a third house and the eventual time of demolition will be dependent upon the action in respect of the fourth property, which was not completed by the end of the year. OVERCROWDING. With the well known acute shortage of housing accommodation, it is impossible to administer strictly the provisions of this Act with respect to overcrowding. It is reasonably safe to say that the majority of cases of overcrowding which do exist are already on the Council's Housing list, additional points being given amounting to some priority for those families who are living under these conditions. The Council have rehoused six overcrowded families during the year, leaving some eleven cases to be dealt with. (13) PUBLIC HEALTH ACT. 1976. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. INVESTIGATION AND DISINFECTION. Investigations have been carried out of the more important cases of infectious disease listed in the Medical Officer of Health's Report, and forty-two premises were disinfected. Where necessary, bedding is taken for disinfection to the Barnet General Hospital under arrangements made during the year. Prior to this, bedding was disinfected at the Coppett's Wood Isolation Hospital which involved a longer cartage distance with consequent higher cost. Two hundred and forty library books rere disinfected before return to libraries. DAIRIES. COWSHEDS AND MILKSHOPS. The control of the production of milk is now vested in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. The local authority is responsible for the inspection and registration of milk distributors and other dairy premises not directly concerned with the production of milk, and for licensing for the sale of Designated Milks. In June 1950, a sample of milk submitted for biological examination for Tubercle Bacilli proved to be positive. The farmer, who retails the milk in this district, was interviewed and he voluntarily agreed to despatch all milk from the herd to the local Pasteurisation plant. Eventually one cow, found to be secreting tuberculous milk, was destroyed and the restriction on the sale of the raw milk was removed. Twenty-seven samples of milk have been taken, in course of delivery to the consumer, and submitted to the appropriate tests with the following results: (14) Designation. No.of Samples Taken. Satisfactory. Unsatisfactory. Tuberculin Tested (Farm Bottled). 2 2 Nil Accredited. 1 1 Nil Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised). 5 5 Nil Pasteurised. 11 11 Nil Pasteuriped (Homogenized). 2 2 Nil Sterilised. 4 4 Nil Ungraded. 2 Nil 2 TOTALS 27 25 2 In connection with the two unsatisfactory samples of raw ungraded milk, copies of the reports were forwarded to the appropriate department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries for action. Seven Dealer's Licences and twenty Supplementary Licences were granted for the retail sale of milk under the Milk (Special Designation)(Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949 and 1950, and the Milk (Special Designation)(Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 and 1950* viz:- Designation„ Dealer's Licences. Supplementary Licences. Tuberculin Tested. Accredited. Pasteurised. Sterilised. 3 Nil 2 2 6 1 6 7 PRIVATE SLAUGHTER-HOUSES AND SLAUGHTER OF ANIMALS ACT. 19T5. Since Food Rationing was introduced the Private Salughter-houses in the district, three in number, have been closed, meat rationing being more easily organised and administered from one abbatoir supplying a large area than from a number of small slaughter-houses in each district. It is doubtful whether these small private slaughter-houses will again be permitted to function. There are ten persons licensed by the Council as fit persons to slaughter animals, one less than in the previous year. These slaughtermen, although (15) licensed by this Authority, work outside the district. No complaint has been received from the districts in which they work concerning the conduct of any of these men. MEAT AND FOOD CONDEMNED. The following is a list of the articles of food condemned as unfit for human consumption during the year. Meat. Beef (English) 152 lbs. Bacon 36 lbs. Mutton (English) 6 lbs. Pressed Beef 4 lbs. Lamb (Imported) 4½ lbs. Corned Beef 189 lbs. Sausages 51 lbs. Ham 233 lbs. Meat Pies 9 lbs. Luncheon Meat 152 lbs. Fish. Wet Fish (Whiting) 15 stones. Herring Roes 20 lbs. Kipprrs 2 stones. Herring Fillets 14 tins. Sathmon 7 tins. Sardines 10 tins. Fish Spread 18 tins. Miscellaneous 14 tins. • Fruit. Oranges 105 lbs. Plums 22 tins. Raisins 20 lbs. Cherries 10 tins. Miscellaneous 27 jars and tins. Vegetables and Cereals. Peas 52 tins. Barley Flakes 24 lbs. Beans 29 tins. Flour 9 lbs. Tomatoes 21 tins. Oatmeal 13 lbs. Vegetables, Miscellaneous 15 tins. Breakfast cereals 17 pkts. Groceries. Tea 3¾ lbs. Fruit Puddings 26 lbs. Fats 23¾ lbs. Milk 196 tins. Cheese 28 lbs. Soup 6 tins. Sugar 5 lbs. Dried soup 114 pkts. Cake 9½ lbs. Pastry mixture 22 pkts. Jam and Marmalade 45 lbs. Pickles and Sauces 34 bottles. Dried Egg 3½ lbs. Coffee Essence 42 bottles. Eggs 360 Nos. (16) FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. 19^8. Those sections of the above Act concerning sampling of food-stuffs for adulteration and sophistication are enforced by the County Authority in this district. The following details shew the number and nature of the samples taken in the Urban District of Barnet during the year, and the results of the analyses. Article. No. of Samples Taken. Genuine. Adulterated. Milk 8 8 - Lunch Meat 1 1 - Whisky 1 1 - Pork Sausages 1 1 - Meat Pie 1 1 - Tinned Cherries 1 1 - Pickles 1 1 - Beef Extract 1 1 - White Pepper 1 1 - Totals 16 16 _ In view of the Ministry of Health suggestions that samples should be taken on the ratio of 3 per 1,000 of the population the number taken in this district could with advantage be increased, having regard to the fact that Barnet, as a shopping centre, serves a greater number of people than the resident population. FOOD PREMISES. During the year the Council adopted the Model Byelaws Series I, concerning the Handling, Wrapping and Delivery of Food and Sale of Food in the Open Air, which were confirmed by the Minister of Food in November, 1950. Owing to difficulties in the Printing trade copies of the Byelaws were not available by the end of the year for issue to all food premises, but with the co-operation of the local Chambe: of Commerce a few copies,of the Byelaws were circulated amongst their members. The number of visits to food preparing premises shews an increase over last year, and kitchens and cooking utensils were inspected for cleanliness. The practice of giving advice on the spot to those concerned is achieving the results required. No residents of this district were notified as suffering from Food Poisoning, but in February some fifty children from a local school were sent home suffering (17) with diarrhoea and nausea. No samples of food from the suspected meal were available, although organisms of the food poisoning type were isolated from patients' stools. During the investigation, it was found that the meat was cooked on the day that it was delivered and re-heated before serving the following day. This is apparently common practice which should, however, be avoided wherever possible unless adequate refrigeration facilities are available. In this case, it was discovered that the refrigerator was being used, although not in working order: the refrigerator did not therefore inhibit the growth of the organisms, in fact, due to its insulation and lack of ventilation it maintained the meat at a temperature suitable for the growth of organisms. DRAINAGE. The drains of twelve premises were found to be defective and were reconstructed under supervision of this department, in addition to which a combined earth closet for three cottages was condemned and replaced by individual brick built closets. A length of drainage pipe, serving four premises, situate between the interceptor chamber and the Council's sewer in the highway was blocked on several occasions and eventually opened up and relaid by the Council, the expenses being recovered from the owners concerned. FACTORIES ACT. 1937. Fifty-two inspections of factories with and without power, and outworkers premises were made during the year. One notification of contravention of the requirements of the Act was received from H.M. Inspector of Factories, in respect of the means of escape in case of fire. Following inspection of the premises, notice was served upon the owner requiring certain works to be carried cut. The term of the notice had not expired by the end of the year. Three other factories were inspected concerning revision of their existing certificates. One certificate was issued, but in the other two cases structural alterations were required which were not completed by the end of the year. (18) VANS USED AS DWELLINGS. The vans which entered the district for the purpose of attending Barnet Fair were in many instances visited in order to ascertain their sanitary condition, and to enquire as to any illness which might be of an infectious character. The provision of temporary sanitary accommodation was enforced in different sections of the fair for the use of the caravanners and public, and regular removal of refuse was arranged. HERTFORDSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL ACT. 1935. Provision is made in this Act for the conduct and regulation of: (1) Hairdressers' and Barbers' Premises; (2) Swimming Baths and Pools, and (3) Employment Agencies. Hairdressers' and Barbers' Premises. The Council made Bye-laws for securing the cleanliness of these premises in 1937- There are seventeen such establishments in the district. No complaints were received concerning their cleanliness or conduct nor were any serious breaches of the Bye-laws noted during inspections of such premises. Public Swimming Baths and Bathing Pools. The only public swimming pool in the district, viz, at "The Barn", Barnet ByPass, is not now in use. Employment Agencies. Prior to the war there were four employment agencies in the district. These, however, are no longer in existence owing to the control of labour and it seems unlikely they will be started up again. PETROLEUM (REGULATION) ACTS. 1928 and 1936. There are thirty-six persons licensed to store petroleum and petroleum mixtures upon the Register. The Licences are for varying quantities from 10 gallons to 6,000 gallons. The total quantity of petroleum spirit and mixtures which may be kept in the various stores is 27,9^3 gallons. Forty-three inspections were made, but there was no serious breach of the Regulations to report. One Licence was issued for the storage of 112 lbs. of Carbide of Calcium. The scale of fees for Licences to Store Petroleum ranges from 5/- for a quantity not exceeding 100 gallons to £1 for 1,000 to 5^000 gallons. (19) RODENT CONTROL. On March 31st, 1-949, the Council accepted the delegated powers of the Herts County Council under the Rats and Mice Destruction Act, 1919, and on March 31st, 1950, the Council became the appropriate authority for the enforcement of the provisions of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949- A full time rodent operator is employed for treatment of infestations of rats and mice. The table below gives details of the work carried out. 1. PREVALENCE OF RATS AND MICE. Type of Property. Number of properties in Local Authority's area.

Ø Excluding treatments included under block treatments. (20) Two notices were served under Section 4 of the Act, on occupiers of dwelling houses, requiring the execution of works to fowl houses. A test bait was made of 10% of the soil sewer manholes in the district, from the results of which are based the two maintenance treatments of the sewers, required by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries as one of the conditions under which the Ministry pay 50% of all rodent control expenses. This year, it was necessary to poison 47 and 25 manholes in these maintenance treatments as compared with 83 manholes poisoned in the only treatment carried out in the previous year. No charge is made for the use of the Rodent Operator's services in treating private domestic premises, provided that the occupiers co-operate in carrying out their duties under the Act. The cost of treatments at all other premises is recoverable. PISINFESTATI0 NS. No infestations of bed bugs have been treated during the year but twenty-two premises were sprayed with a D.D.T. solution, or otherwise treated, for infestations of beetles, ants, crickets, etc., and 12 wasp's nests were destroyed. For economic reasons these reports have been typed on both sides of the paper. I am, Yours obediently, J. Bo WILSON. Chief Sanitary Inspector.
