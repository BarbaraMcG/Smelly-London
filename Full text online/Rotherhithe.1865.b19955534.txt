The Vestry in December, 1865, caused a Memorial to the Metropolitan Board of Works to be prepared, urging the formation of the "Southwark Park" without delay, and a Deputation from the Vestry waited upon that Board to present same, when the Chairman (Sir John Thwaites) informed the Deputation that the park would be carried out as speedily as possible, having regard to the interests of the Rate-payers. Upon the application of the Vestry, the Commissioner of Police has appointed a standing for four Hackney Carriages in Church-street, to commence at the corner of Princes-street, and extend along Church-street towards the " Europa," Public-house. The Vestry have applied to the Metropolitan Board of Works, for their formal order (under the 87th section of the 25 and 26 Vict. c. 102) for the renumbering of the houses in the following thoroughfares in this parish, viz.—Union-road, Paradise-row, and Deptford Lower-road. During the past year the Vestry have presented the following petitions to the House of Commons (through John Locke, Esq., M.P.) viz:— A Petition for the Amendment of the Statute of Merton and the General Enclosure Act, so as to prevent Lords of Manors from enclosing commons within 20 miles of London, without a special Act of Parliament. A Petition for such an alteration in the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Bill, as would ensure a contribution from the Insurance Companies of not less than the sum of £25000 (the expense of the late Fire Brigade), and that the Rate to be raised on the Metropolis, should not exceed one farthing in the pound on the County Assessment. The Vestry deeming it expedient upon the rebuilding of the property destroyed by fire in Rotherhithe-street, near Hanover-street, that the first mentioned street should be widened at that spot, they arranged with the Freeholder and Leaseholders; and the premises, viz.— 1'he " Ship Public-house, the two adjoining houses and carpenter's shop, were set back 3 feet <> inches, at a cost of £455, one third, (£151 13s. 4d.) of which was contributed by the Metropolitan Board of W orks, leaving £303 6s. 8d. to be borne by the Vestry. 17 Messrs. Porks submitted a plan for improving the portion of the Surrey Mill Stream between Millpond Bridge and Union bridge, to which the Vestry saw no objection, and the work is now in progress. Upon the dwceas.' of Mr. Joseph Bishop, the late clerk of the Works, the Vestry revised the duties of the office, so that the officer to be elected would have the overlooking of tinworkmen cmploved upon the streets and roads as well as the sewers' workmen. Advertisements for candidates for the office were issued, and from 30 applicants the Vestry elected Mr. Edward Thomas as their clerk of the Works, under the Surveyors of Sewers and Pavements, at a salary of £3 per week. APPENDIX No. I. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. From 25th March, 1865, to 24th March, 1866. To the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, Surrey. GENTLEMEN, I HEREWITH lay before you my Fourth Annual Report. Tables of mortality for each quarter of the elapsed year, and for the whole year are annexed to it. It treats of the causes of that mortality, of the number of births and increase of population, of nuisances abated, and miscellaneous sanitary work done. Except in the year when the census is taken, it is exceedingly difficult to make a correct estimate of the number of the inhabitants of Rotherhithe. Certain it is, however, that the quantity of peoplo in this parish is rapidly on the increase. The growth of trade which brings every year a larger number of shipping into the river and Surrey Commercial Docks, augments the floating population, the present thriving state of the yards and manufactorie s has attructed numerous lubourers and workmen from neighbouring districts. Somo dwellings, it is true, have lately been pulled down to make room for a great public work, yet but few of the inmates of those dwellings have migrated elsewhere, and during the last twelvemonths many houses have been, or are now being built. There is srarcely a tenement or even an apartment to let in the locality, and such in the eagerness to obtain residences, that houses are occupied long before they are properly finished, F 18 and the whole place bears visible signs of increase and prosperity. I trust also, that this Report will show an improved state of healthfulness, to whatever cause it is to be attributed. From the years 1851 to 1861, the population of Rotherhithe increased by 6697 souls, or at about the rate of 670 annually; that during the last five years, and particularly during the past year, a rapid growth has taken place is clearly and distinctly proved by an unfailing test, namely, the number of births, which exceeded by 72, those of the preceeding twelvemonths. Without entering into minute details, let it be here stated that I believe the resident inhabitants of this parish to be at least 25,000, and the floating inhabitants (all males), to average about 2000, in all 27000, and upon this number, I shall base my calculations. If any person were to cast a glance over the tables annexed to this report, he must be struck with one fact, namely, the large amount of inquests in proportion to the total of the registered deaths. Thus, to 581 of the latter, there are 54 of the former, or in round numbers about 1 in 11, so that one might be naturally enough led to conclude that every eleventh death in Rotherhithe is either sudden, accidental, or violent. Such, however, is not the case. From the set of the tide in the Thames, many bodies are cast ashore at the Point, and inquests are held on them. Thus out of the 54 above mentioned, 24 had no connexion whatever with the parish, except that of the inquest on them being held in it, though they swell on the register the apparent mortality. Of the 30 remaining, by far the greater number were oh the bodies of men drowned in the river, or the docks, labourers, lightermen, and seamen, English and Foreign. All these however must be counted, as they form part of the floating population. Let then, 24 be deducted from 581, and we leave 557 as the true mortality from March 25th 1865, to March 24th 1866, and taking 27,000 as the population, the death rate has been 20-64 in the thousand, or about 3 below the average mortality of the metropolis. Let us now compare the death rate with that of the preceding two years. No of deaths regd. Corrected mortality. Death rate. From March 25, 1863, to March 24, 1864 664 647 24 do. 1864, do. 1865 592 577 21.8 do. 1865, do. 1866 581 557 20.14 Thus, notwithstanding the increase of population, both the mortality and the death rate from March 1865, to March 1866 were smaller than in either of the two previous years, and it may be safely assumed that the elapsed year was a very healthy one. Let us here remark that the number of deaths from 1863 to i864 was much augmented by the presence in the parish of two epidemic diseases, fever and small pox, but from 1864 to 1865 may be considered as an average year. 952 births were registered, namely, 478 males, and 474 females, being 72 in excess of the year preeediug. I here is no surer sign than this, of the rapid growth of population. 1 he registered births exceeded the registered deaths by 371, and the corrected mortality after deducting the 24 inquests above mentioned by 391. With regard to the seasons the largest mortality, 176, was during the summer quarter From June 24, to September 29, and the smallest during the Autumn from September 29, to December 25. 19 218 died under two years of age, and 56 from two to five, making in all 274, or about 16 less than half. The oldest person registered was aged 98 years. During the past year, 148 notices were served for various nuisances, principally arising from imperfect drainage, dung heaps, accumulations of filth, pigs, pools of stagnant water, &c. The report of the surveyor will give the length of new sewer constructed, and the number of drains repaired or completed. All this was done without a single summons being taken out, or any proceedings being instituted in a Court of Law. Quiet remonstrance, and an appeal to the better feelings of the inhabitants has always attained the desired object. Thus, two years have passed away without any officer of the vestry having appeared in a Court of Justice on the part of the parish. The water supply of Rotherhithe is abundant in the eastern district, and more abundant than it used to be in the western, at any rate, fewer complaints of deficiency have reached the ears of the sanitary officers, It is now generally recognised that the health and life of large and populous communities is greatly affected by the water supply. Where water has been deficient and impure, there disease has been rife and the mortality high. It is to be regretted that the supply is still intermittent and stored in butts, which, among the humbler clases are often allowed to become filthy. The water supplied by the companies is of good quality, but is often contaminated by the foul state of the receptacle in which it accumulates. When the cholera raged in Rotherhithe, in the year 1849, the inhabitants of the waterside portion of the eastern district made use either of water from the Thames, or from shallow wells, often rendered impure by the leakage of drains, rat-holes, and percolations from gutters and cesspools; and the mortality in that part of the parish was frightfully large. The cholera again made its appearance in 1854; in the interval, the district had been drained and supplied with excellent water from the Kent Water Works. No part in London suffered less from the epidemic of 1854, and the waterside portion continues to this day, the healthiest in Rotherhithe. There used to be in this parish, four licensed cow-houses, in which were kept from 25 to 30 cows. The fear of the rinderpest has altered this; one cow-keeper has entirely given up business, another finds it more profitable to get his daily supply of milk from the country. Two still remain, and 1 believe there are at present (1st June, 1866), but four cows in the licensed shed*. Two beasts died of the cattle plague, at Mr. Blake's, dairy-man, near the St. Helena. The slaughter-houses have never been complained of. During the summer of 1865, a oow affected with lung disease was brought under my notice at a licensed slaughterhouse. The government cattle inspector, Mr. Lowe, to whom I applied, gave orders that the animal should be at once killed. The earcass was taken back to the place whence it came, (Burnt Ash Farm, Kent), and buried there under the supervision of Mr. Sanders, the Inspector of Nuisances. There is reason to believe that the Fish Manure Factory, Jamaica Ixjvel, will shortly disappear, the occupier being now under notice to quit at Midsummer next. Unpleasunt stenches are still ol'u n exhaled from the manure makers at Globe Wharf. The black ditch which furuished, continually, the sanitary officers and other inedieal persons with a subject of vituperation, will probably in a short space of time be covered over 20 by the Metropolitan Board, and the days of the Surrey Mill stream are numbered. The abominations of the latter have been recently described in one of my monthly reports. To conclude, the elapsed year has been a very healthy one. Let us, however, not relax our endeavours, as there remains undoubtedly still much to do, but our success in the past, is an encouragement to exertion in the future. Every year's experience, says a modern authority, shows more completely, that man, by the application of his knowledge of the laws by which the Creator governs the world, can (to a certain extent), control the causes of disease and death. I have to thank the Board for its continued kindness towards me, and the Yestry Clerk and Surveyor for their valuable advice and assistance. Yours, respectfully, (Signed) W. MURDOCH.
