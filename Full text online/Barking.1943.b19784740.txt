BARK 78 BOROUGH OF BARKING. THE ANNUAL R E P 0 R T of the SCHOOL MEDICAL OFFICER. FOR THE YEAR 1943 (War Edition) C. LEONARD WILLIAMS. B.SC.,M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., D.P,H. BOROUGH OF BARKING. ANNUAL REPORT of the School Medical Officer for the Borough of Barking, in the County of Essex, for the year ended 31st December, 1943. (War Edition). Public Health Department, Barking, Essex. April, 1944. To the Chairman & Members of the Local Education Authority. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in submitting my report for the year ended 31st December, 1943. Once again, owing to the war it is in attenuate form, but I proudly believe it is neither pale nor anaemic, but shows a robust state of affairs. It shows that your services have stood up to the strain of wartime conditions and, what is more important, it shows that the children have stood up to the strain of wartime conditions. It shows that although during the days of the great blitz we lost some of our ideals with regard to cleanliness, the people of Barking are resilient; that so soon as the blitz was over they began to set their houses in order so far as cleanliness was concerned. Indeed, herein I would advise you that if that small percentage of dirty people who form a reservoir of infestation were dealt with drastically, the rest of the people would have a much easier, and certainly a less anxious, time. I have no desire at this stage to draw wonderful conclusions from our happy state with regard to the relatively small incidence of diphtheria amongst school children, but at least it must be stated that this freedom is associated with mass immunisation against diphtheria, which on the whole has been carried out very successfully in Barking. Although the teachers in' the schools have so many incidental duties which interfere with their work proper, and although my own staff have had so many incidental duties placed upon them by reason of the war, and although one might jump to the conclusion that all this must mean from time to time that pettifogging difficulties are bound to arise, as a matter of fact that is not so. The generous measure of co-operation we have always received from the teachers has been most generously maintained and I wish to express my appreciation for all the help which I have received and which all the members of my staff have received from them. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, Medical Officer of Health. - 2 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SCHOOL MEDICaL OFFICER, FOR THE YEAR 1943. (War Edition). 1. STAFF. The following indicates the changes that have taken place in the Staff daring the year 1943. Medical Staff. Dr. C. J. de Vere Shortt, Deputy Medical Officer of Health (temporary) - Resigned 30. 9.43.

During the year mambers of the staff have continued to participate in the Civil Defence Scheme, tut for the most part they have been engaged upon their normal duties in connection with the Public Health and Medical Services, - 3 - 2. hygiene. The general conditions of the Schools regarding sanitaryarrangements etc., are as satisfactory as possible under existing circumstances. Heating has, of course, been a problem, but one with which it has been relatively easy to deal because I have been able to give favourable consideration to applications for fires to be restarted when the weather has been cold. Your Feeding Centres are visited regularly by Medical Officers and with few exceptions their reports are satisfactory both as regards the quantity and quality of the food provided for the children. 3.FOLLOWING UP. Valuable work has been done by Health Visitors and School Nurses in this direction and in each case where treatment has been offered and not taken advantage of, one of your Nurses has paid a visit to the home in an endeavour to get the treatment carried out. In the period under review School Nurses and Health Visitors paid 4,586 visits to the homes of your school children. 4. MEDICAL INSPECTION. During the year 1943 Routine Medical Inspection has been carried out at each school in accordance with Board of Education Circular No. 1523, and with few exceptions all children attending schools in Barking have been medically examined, including those under five years of age who attend the Wartime Nursery Glasses. The following table summarises the number of children examined within the prescribed age groups, together with the number of those examined outside such groups - placed in the category of "Other Routine Inspections":- (a) Routine Medical Inspections. Year 1942. Year 1943. Entrants 1,888 1,425 Second Age-group 1,790 1,204 Third Age-group 1,330 944 Total 5,008 3,573 Number of Other Routine Inspections. 4,175 5,700 Grand Total 9,183 9,273 - 4 - (b) Other Inspections. Many children were examined under this head with the result that defects referred for treatment or observation in previous years were cleared. The numbers of Special Inspections and Re-inspections during the last two years are shewn below from which it will be observed that there is an increase of approximately twenty three per cent on comparison with the year 1942. Year Year 1942. 1943. Number of Special Inspections and Re-inspections. 21,549 26,493 5. CONTROL SERIES OF HEIGHTS AND WEIGHTS OF CHILDREN LIVING IN BARKING. The Chief Medical Officer of the Board of Education was again supplied with particulars of the heights and weights of selected children living in Barking for comparison with those who had been evacuated to Camp at Hydon Heath. The following statement shows the progress of children in the various age groups during recent years:- AVERAGE HEIGHT AND WEIGHT. BOYS. AgeGroup. Number of individual children examined.

A. Gray - from three to five per week. The first additional session commenced in March and in October permission was given for one further session. This session commenced on the 9th November, 1943. A total of 184 sessions were held during the year compared with 154 in 1942, and 104 in 1941. The following table showing the number of defects dealt with during the past three years is appended for your information. 6. ARRANGEMENTS FOR TREATMENT. (a) Minor Ailments.

Mr. F. Courtenay Mason, your Consultant Specialist, held forty four sessions at the Central Clinic, an increase of sixteen sessions over the previous year. Operative Treatment was carried out at Queen Mary's, King George and St. Mary1 s Hospitals. It was not found possible to recommence operations at the Barking Hospital. The statistics set out hereunder, indicate that there was a decided increase during 1943 in the number of children treated for Nose and Throat conditions. TREATMENT OF DEFECTS OF NOSE AND THRO AT.

The facilities for the treatment of children at dental clinics were maintained despite the unavoidable, changes in staff during the period under review. A summary of the activities of this service for the twelve months ended 31st, December, 1943 is reproduced herewith together with a similar statement in respect of the years 1941 and 1942. - 8 - (l) Number of children inspected Ty the Dentist: - (a) Routine Age-groups:- Year 1941 Tear 1942 Year 1943 Age 5 (and 4) 431 174 524 6 470 130 459 7 677 244 536 8 646 279 503 9 784 296 538 10 747 299 516 11 400 451 504 12 604 516 379 13 541 358 322 14 (and 15) 119 138 20 Totals 5,419 2,885 4,301 (b) Specials:- 607 875 977 (c) TOTAL (Routine and Specials). 6,026 3,760 5,278 (2) Number found to require Treatment:- 5,001 3,229 3,301 (3) Number actually treated: - 1,911 1, 821 2,728 (4) Attendances made by children for Treatment:- 6,114 7,069 10,863 (5) Half-days devoted to:- Inspection 44 18 35 690 797 1,063 Totals 734 815 1,098 (6) Fillings - Permanent Teeth. 3,410 3,847 5,507 Temporary Teeth. 137 227 865 Totals 3,547 4,074 6,372 (7) Extractions - Permanent Teeth. 1,021 1,306 1,542 Temporary Teeth. 3,099 2,962 6,084 Totals 4,120 4,268 7,626 (8) Administrations of general anaesthetics for extractions. 1,767 1,892 3,174 (9) Other operations Permanent Teeth Temporary Teeth 3,189 4,470 3,494 - 9 - (e) Report on the work of the Orthopaedic Clinic. Mr. A. M. A. Moore, your Consultant Specialist, examined Two hundred and eleven children during the year, which is a slight decrease compared with the number of school children examined in 1942, (254). The work carried out by the Masseuses increased to such an extent however, that it was found necessary to engage the service of an additional assistant who took up her duties in October, 1943.

This treatment is still available for appropriate cases but none were treated during 1943. - 10 - (g) Speech Training. Speech Training was recommenced in the year 1943, and eighty one children were examined and recommended for inclusion in Speech Training Classes. Latterly, consideration has been given to the question of the age at which children would most benefit from Speech Tuition and it was agreed that children under the age of eleven years, attending a Junior School, should not normally be recommended for such Tuition, except in specially selected cases. (h) Foot Clinic. The Municipal Foot Clinic has been held throughout the year at the East Street premises.The attendances of school children are much less than in the previous year, this being due, in large measure to the decline in numbers of children suffering from Plantar Warts, which was rather prevalent in the latter part of 1942. Year Year Year 1941. 1942. 1943. Attendance of O.E.S. Scholars at Municipal Foot Clinic 277 436 213 7. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. (a) Scarlet Fever. Two hundred and fifty three cases were notified as suffering from Scarlet Fever, this being somewhat more than the number (211) notified in 1942. There were no outstanding features however and the cases reported were of a mild nature. The temporary arrangements approved by the Ministry of Health whereby medicine and medical assistance with nursing can be supplied, where necessary, are still in operation. (b) Whooping Cough. There were ninety four notified cases of school children suffering from Whooping Cough but I am pleased to be able to report that here again nothing in the shape of an epidemic was experienced. (c) Measles. This type of disease shewed a marked decrease, only three hundred and thirty five cases being notified in 1943 against six hundred and sixty one during the previous year. (d) Diphtheria. Only nine cases were notified which is thirteen less than in 1942 when there were twenty two notifications. In my last report I referred to the campaign against this disease by means of immunisation and there is no doubt that the danger of children contracting the disease is greatly diminished thereby. It is significant that out of a School population of 10,718, at the 31st December, 1943, ten thousand five hundred and sixty eight school children had been completely immunised, (about ninety one per cent). - 11 - 8, SKIN DISEASES. (a) Scabies. The incidence of Scabies decreased during the year under review due, I think, to our arrangements for the followingup of suspected cases and the provision of baths and out-patient treatment. Perusal of the statistics shows a fall of thirty three per cent in such cases. (b) Other Skin Diseases. Reference was made in my Report for 1942 to the inauguration of a clinic specially for the treatment of skin diseases. A further step forward in your health services has been achieved by the appointment to your consultant staff of Dr. Arthur Burrows, Specialist Consultant in skin diseases at the London Hospital. Dr. Burrows attends weekly, his first session being held on the l6th February, 1943, and up to the end of that year, Two hundred and seventy one school children were seen by him. Treatment recommended by your Consultant is carried out at the treatment clinics held on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and during 1943, One thousand two hundred and seventy five attendances were made by three hundred and fourteen school children. By adaptation of the premises at your Central Clinic, oases of skin diseases can now be segregated from other out-patients. This procedure was adopted from the 11th October, 1943, and up to the end of December, One hundred and eleven cases received One thousand and forty one treatments. The following table shows the defects dealt with at all your Clinics for the treatment of skin conditions in school children for the past three years:- Year 1941. Year 1942. Year 1943.

On the 31st December, 1943, the number of children attending Elementary Schools in Barking was 10,718, of whom 9,273 had been medically examined at School. The standard of nutrition disclosed by such examinations has in most cases proved to be satisfactory, but as pointed out in my survey last year, there are no generally recognised standards of Nutrition, and classification remains in the hands of Medical Officers whose standard of values has been fixed by experience outside Barking, and in some instances, outside England. After allowing for the individual differences amongst Medical Officers at such examinations it is still encouraging to note (see table on Page 13 of this Report) that malnutrition in its worse sense still remains infrequent amongst children attending the elementary schools of your Town. 12 - Table showing the number of children inspected in the Routine Age-groups during the years 1941, 1942 and 1943, and the Classification of the Nutrition of such children.

UNCLEANLINESS. The question of cleansing was included in my Report to the Education Committee in January 1943, and dealt chiefly with your deoision not to build a Cleansing Station as, in my opinion, you rightly held that the duty of cleansing verminous children rested primarily with the parent. It may well be that owing to abnormal conditions in the early days of the war parents were unable to devote sufficient time to oleansing of childrens heads. Whatever the cause, there is no doubt that such cases increased between the years 1939 and 1942. Records for the year 1939 show that 25 per 1,000 children inspected were found to be unclean, whereas in 1941 and 1942 the figure had increased to 36 per 1,000 despite the reduced numbers of individual children inspected, owing to evacuation etc., During 1943 we accelerated our efforts to obtain the cooperation of the parents, and urged them to keep constant watch on the heads of their children. This seems to have met with success, as the number of individual children found uncle am fell to 33 per 1,000 and I am hoping that this improvement will continue. CLEANLINESS INSPECTIONS AND RESULTS.

NURSERY CLASSES. Since tho commencement of hostilities these Classes have grown so much that practically all your Schools cater for the reception of children between the ages of three and five, where adequate rest and reasonable discipline are provided. Medical examination of children at each Nursery Class is made when Medical Officers visit the School for Routine Inspection, in addition to -Which your Health Visitors and School Nurses visit the Classes regularly for the purpose of examining each child as to cleanliness and to follow-up any defect which may be brought -to their notice. Children are thus imbued at an early age with the need for cleanliness etc., At the close of 1943, there were Six hundred and ninety seven children attending these Classes, - 14 - 12. SPECIAL SCHOOLS. Faircross School continued to function, the number of Physioally defective children on the roll being Sixty-seven and Mentally defective forty-five. Nineteen sessions of School medical inspection were carried out. 13. OPEN-AIR EDUCATION. (a) The suspension of week-end school camps continued throughout 1943. (b) No. 5 NATIONAL SCHOOL CAMP, HYDON HEATH. Hydon Heath Camp School continued to function and the Camp Matron sends me an interesting report each week which future historians, if these come to their notice, will find an interesting commentary of the days in which we are living. The number of ohildren in the Camp during the year varied from One hundred and fifty to One hundred and eighty. This is quite a fair sized Camp, and notwithstanding its size the amount of infectious disease has been remarkably small. Two children only had colds sufficiently serious to give than a temperature, three children had mumps and five children suffered from impetigo. I doubt whether there is any similar body of children elsewhere which can show a better record. What has struck me also is the relative freedom of the children at the Camp from infestation by nits and lice. This Camp has shewn that the degree of infestation which, unfortunately, we have come to look upon as quite usual, can be reduced almost to nothing if people have the opportunity of living under decent conditions and make the best of these conditions. Naturally, when thinking of this favourable condition I think of our Camp Matron, Miss Everett, and, of course, a lot of the credit it due to her. I also want to pay a very generous tribute of praise to Miss Jakeways, the Headmistress, and her staff, who are maintaining at this Camp a very high standard of personal hygiene. The accident rate is not high. There were only fifteen accidents during the year and I know of no way of allowing children to enjoy themselves, and by sturdy independence to become self reliant, without having a few tumbles. I am happy to say that all the accidents, save one, need not be looked upon as serious from a surgical standpoint. A synopsis of the work undertaken AT THE HYDON HEATH SCHOOL CAMP is submitted herewith - MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS AND ATTENDANCES FOR TREATMENT. Year 1941. Year 1942. Year 1943.

PROVISION OF SCHOOL MEDICAL SERVICES TOR SECONDARY AND TECHNICS SCHOLARS IN THE AREA. The Medical Inspection of pupils attending Secondary and Teohnical Schools in Barking continues to be carried out on behalf of the Essex County Council. The majority of your treatment services are also available including the Specialist Consultant services. Medical examinations of students who had been granted Intermediate Awards as Intending Teachers were also conducted and five reports upon such cases were forwarded to the County Authority. The following statistics show the extent to which the numerous services, afforded by the Barking Authority, are utilized by the Secondary and Technical pupils, and I think it right to draw attention to the fact that no dental inspection was made, chiefly owing to staffing difficulties.
