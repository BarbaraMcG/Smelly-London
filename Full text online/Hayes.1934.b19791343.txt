Madam and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report on the health of your Urban District for the year 1934. There has been no noteworthy epidemic during the year, the cases of Scarlet Fever notified having dropped from 181 in 1933 to 109 in 1934. My thanks are due to the Members and Officials of the Council for their interest and help in the discharge of my duties. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, J.

Gross £827 Net (Est.) £747 SOCIAL CONDITIONS. The Urban District of Hayes and Harlington was formed by the union of the Parishes of Hayes, Harlington and Cranford, but during the year 1934 that portion of Cranford lying east of the River Crane was transferred to the Borough of Heston and Isleworth and various other adjustments in the boundary were made, thus reducing the area from 5,513 to 5,161 acres. Formerly the district was purely agricultural and horticultural but the last thirty years has seen a distinct alteration in its character as factories have sprung up in considerable numbers, chiefly in the neighbourhood of the railway station and canal. There arc a few farms left and a number of nurseries for the growing of strawberries, fruit trees, etc. Befng of recent construction the factories are for the most part of not unpleasant appearance, one of them being especially well laid out in the middle of its own playing fields and gardens. The highest point in the district is at Charville Lane (182 feet above sea level) and the lowest (70 feet above sea level) below the bridge where the Bath Road crosses the River Crane. The sub-soil is clay in the north and east and gravel in the west, the surface being for the most part quite flat. Public parks in the district have an area of 190 acres, some of them having been laid out for games and sports. There is an absence of slums, no doubt on account of the fact that until recent years there were few houses at all in the 5 This year the Registrar-General has supplied a Comparability Factor for adjusting the local death-rates of 1931 and subsequent years. This adjustment takes into consideration the proportions of the population in regard to sex and age. The crude death rate does not do this. By multiplying the crude death rate by this factor we get a figure of 9.91 per thousand which is a truer estimate of the death rate of this area as compared with the country as a whole.

Six of the fatal cases were pedal cyclists, two were motor cyclists and four pedestrians. SECTION B. GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA. No alteration has been made in the health services of this area during 1934. PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITY. The Staff of the Public Health Department consists of one part-time Medical Officer and two Sanitary Inspectors, the Chi6f Sanitary Inspector being also the Inspector under the Petroleum Acts. The Chief Sanitary Inspector holds the special Meat and Food Inspector's Certificate of the Royal Sanitary Institute, and the other Officer has also passed an examination in meat inspection. Contributions to the salaries of these Officers are received under the Public Health Acts. Hospitals.—Hospital accommodation in this area is adequate. The Urban District Council contributes the equivalent of a penny rate to the Hayes Cottage Hospital, and the Harlington Cottage Hospital, the contributions being apportioned according to the rateable value of the respective parishes. There has been no change in nursing arrangements, laboratory facilities, hospitals, ambulance facilities, or clinics and treatment centres. 9 SECTION C. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Water.—Four samples of water from private wells and three from piped supplies have been submitted for bacteriological examination, the results of which are set out in the Schedule. Seven of the eight houses involved have now been provided with supplies from the main ; the remaining one, being too far from a piped supply to connect, is being kept under observation. Drainage and Sewerage.—The following lengths of branch sewers were completed in the Parish of Harlington during the year:— Diameter. Length. 4" 1,764 feet. 6" 10,623 „ 9" 10,132 „ 12" 2,481 „ 21" 1,051 „ and the following lengths of trunk sewers in the northern part of the district:— Diameter. Length. 6" 113 feet. 9" 2,563 „ 12" 745 „ 15" 1,389 „ 21" 3,216 „ 24" 1,592 „ 27" 110 „ 30" 2,791 „ 36" 1,087 „ Size 52" x 36" 1,227 „ „ 56"x36" 2,535 „ Hayes Gate Pumping Station was enlarged, two electrically driven pumps capable of lifting 51,000 and 77,000 gallons per hour were installed with automatically operated raking apparatus on the screen, a new 14"/15" pumping main to the Minet Drive Disposal Works was put in and the three ejector or pumping stations fn Park Lane, Yeading Lane and Grange Park Estate were superseded ; the sewage now gravitates to the Hayes Gate Station. 10 It is anticipated that the West Middlesex Sewerage Scheme will be ready to receive a portion of the sewage about the end of the year 1935 and the balance at a later date according to the progress with the completion of the Mogden Works. Closet Accommodation.—Every house connected with the sewer has a water-closet provided with flushing apparatus. Of the premises not connected with the sewer a number have water-closets and the remainder pail-closets, of which the Council undertake the cleansing. During the year 602 new W.C.s have been constructed, and one privy with fixed receptacle and 12 with movable receptacles have been converted. The estimated number and type of closets at the end of 1934 are as follows:— Water Closets 8,497 Privies (movable receptacles) 204 Privies (fixed receptacles) 13 Public Cleansing.—Closed motor vehicles are used to remove house refuse to the dump at Yeading, collections being made once weekly. The tip is covered daily with dead ashes from older parts of the dump. Pail closets are also emptied every week, a clean pail being substituted for the used one. Cesspools are emptied by a large motor exhauster, the contents being discharged onto the sewage farm. During the year the Middlesex County Council promoted a Bill in Parliament which provided that after 1st April, 1935, new regulations could be made enabling the Local Authorities to impose stricter conditions on the disposal of refuse at Yeading by the Paddington Borough Council. 11 SUMMARY OF REPORTS ON WATER SAMPLES SUBMITTED FOR BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION, 1934. Report No. and Date. Organisms produced on gelatine plates incubated at 20°C. for 3 days. Organisms produced on agar plates incubated at 37.5CC. for 2 days. B. Coli. Streptococci. B. Enteritidis Sporogenes. REMARKS. 1656 (Godfrey's Farm) 15/1/34 1,580 per c.c. 260 per c.c. Present in 2 c.c. Present in 10 c.c. Present in 25 c.c. The sample contains a considerable number of excremental organisms and is not fit for drinking purposes in its present condition. The surroundings of this well are undesirable in a domestic supply and there is some evidence to suggest that the water has been in a worse condition than it is at present. 14720 (Victoria Cottages) 23/3 34 7,400 per c.c. 24 per c.c. Present in 2 c.c. Present in 10 c.c. Present in 25 c.c. The water contains a considerable number of excremental organisms and there are indications that it has been in this state for a considerable time. It should not be used for drinking purposes, but if there is no alternative supply the water should be boiled before use. 14721 (Bet-linge Cottages) 23/3/34 320 per c.c. 7 per c.c. Present in 100 c.c. not found in less. Not found in 30 c.c. Not found in 100 c.c. The examination shows a few B.Coli not associated with other excremental organisms and therefore not indicating definitely pollution with excrement. These bacilli might quite well be accounted for by the loose-fitting cover and sewage pollution is highly improbable. The water is reasonably safe for drinking as judged by this examination. 32047 Pinkwell Cottages) 25/6/34 1,500 per c.c. 375 per c.c. Present in 25 c.c. Present in 30 c.c. Present in 100 c.c. The water is found to contain a large number of microorganisms a small percentage of which are of excremental origin. The close proximity of manured land and animals and the comparative nearness of a cesspool are undesirable features and it might be advisable to boil the water before drinking. 53248 (S.W. Suburban Water Co.) 31/10/34 12 per c.c. 7 per c.c. Not found in 100 c.c. Not found in 30 c.c. Present in 100 c.c., not found in less The sample contains a few objectionable spores but taking the result as a whole the water can be regarded as suitable for drinking purposes from a bacteriological point of view. 53249 (Rickmansworth Water Co.) 31/10/34 80 per c.c. 26 per c.c. Not found in 100 c.c. Not found in 30 c.c. Not found in 100 c.c. The sample contains a few short streptococci in a quantity over 30 c.c. but as they are not of a faecal type they can be disregarded. The water is suitable for drinking purposes from a bacteriological point of view. 53250 (Allied Building Corpn.) 31/10/34 11 per c.c. 6 per c.c. Not found in 100 c.c. Not found in 30 c.c. Not found in 100 c.c. The sample .shows a low bacterial contence and no excremental types of bacteria are present. From a bacteriological point of view this water is of excellent quality.
