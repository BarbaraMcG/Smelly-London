Analytical and Consulting Chemist (Part-time) 1 TO THE MA YOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE BOROUGH OF SUTTON AND CHEAM Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the Annual Report on the health of the Borough for the year 1960. It has been prepared in accordance with Ministry of Health Circular Number 1/60. The estimated population showed an increase of six hundred and eighty. The birth rate was slightly higher at 13.6 per thousand of population (13.0 in 1959). The death rate declined to 113 per thousand of population from 12.0 in 1959. The infant mortality rate dropped to 13.9 per thousand live births (16.5 in 1959), which again compares very favourably with the National rate. There was no maternal death for the second year running. There was a lower incidence of infectious disease, despite increases in Whooping Cough and Dysentery. There was no case of Diphtheria, Meningococcal Infection, or Enteric Fever, nor, for the second successive year since 1944, of Poliomyelitis. A mass miniature radiography unit visited the Borough from 21st November to 1st December. Housing remains one of the Borough's major problems. Too many families live with grandparents, or have other shared accommodation, which nearly always leads to irritation and friction and other ills. It is to be hoped that the Council's efforts to institute a major housing scheme will be successful in 1961. Five new houses or flats were provided during the year and a further ninety one were planned or under construction at the end of the year. Six families were transferred to New Towns and seven to Frimley and Camberley during the year. Work proceeded during the year on the design of Stage III of the reconstruction scheme at the Worcester Park Sewage Works, and improvements were made at the Sutton Sewage Disposal Works. The controlled tip was closed in September on completion of the Council's refuse transfer station, and since then all refuse is conveyed out of the Borough for tipping. The Noise Abatement Act, 1960, came into force on 27th November, and should be of assistance in dealing with complaints arising where a noise nuisance is found. The water supply of the district was maintained at a high standard of chemical and bacteriological purity. My thanks are due to the Water Engineer and Chemist of the Sutton District Water Company for keeping me advised on all matters affecting that supply. The work of sanitation was efficiently carried out under the direction of the Chief Public Health Inspector I thank him for his helpful collaboration and report, and also the Inspectorial and clerical staffs for 2 the work they have done during the year. I am grateful for the continued co-operation received from the County staff at both County and Divisional levels, from Hospital and Laboratory staffs, and the General Practitioners of the district. This is true also of my fellow Chief Officers and their staffs. Finally, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I should like to express my thanks for the support you have given me during the year. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN C. BIRCHALL Medical Officer of Health. 3 SUMMARY OF VITAL STATISTICS FOR I960 Area in acres 4338.15 Population: Registrar General's Estimate of the Resident Population (at 30th June 1960) 79,860 Census, 1951 80,664 Number of inhabited houses (end of year) according to the Rate Book 25,233 Rateable Value £1,645,012 Product of a Penny Rate £.6,733 Males Females Total Live Births 565 518 1083 Legitimate 543 497 1040 Illegitimate 22 21 43 Illegitimate Live Births per cent of total Live Births 3.97 Live Birth Rate per 1000 of the Estimated Resident Population: Crude 13.56 As adjusted by comparability factor (1.03) 13.97 (England & Wales 17.1 ) Still Births 12 8 20 Legitimate 12 8 20 Illegitimate 0 0 0 Still Birth Rate per 1000 total (live and still births) 18.13 (England & Wales 19. 7) Deaths 410 490 900 Death Rate per 1000 of the Estimated Resident Population: Crude 11.27 As adjusted by comparability factor (0.96) 10. 8 (England & Wales 11. 5) Deaths from Sepsis 0 Other Maternal Causes 0 Death Rate from Maternal Causes per 1000 total (live and still births) 0.00 (England & Wales) 0.39 Deaths of Infants under one year of age: All Infants per 1000 live births 13. 9 (England & Wales) 21. 7 Legitimate Infants per 1 000 legitimate live births 11. 5 Illegitimate Infants per 1 000 illegitimate live births 69. 7 Neo-natal Mortality rate (under 4 weeks) 12. 9 (England & Wales) 15. 6 Early Neo-natal Mortality rate (under 1 week) 11. 1 Perinatal Mortality Rate (still births+deaths under 1 week) per 1000 total live and still births 29.0 4 CAUSES OF DEATH IN THE BOROUGH OF SUTTON AND CHEAM DURING 1960 M.

Of these, twelve were legitimate infants and three illegitimate infants. The infantile mortality rate was 13.9 per thousand live births, compared with 21.7 per thousand live births for England and Wales. Of the: fifteen deaths, fourteen occurred in the neonatal period within one month of birth, twelve being within the first week, as is shown in the following table of causes and age groups.

(2) Offices Act, I960 Comes into force on the 1st January 1962 and is an Act to make further and better provisions for health, welfare and safety in Offices, and empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations specifying the standards as to the structure, arrangement and operation to be applied in Offices. 6 (3) Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960 This Act made further provision for the licensing and control of caravan sites, authorised Local Authorities to provide and operate caravan sites, and amended the law relating to enforcement notices, etc. under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947. (4) Oil Burners (Standards) Act, 1960 This Act comes into operation on the 1st January 1961 and the Secretary of State may make regulations which provide for safety standards and instructions for use of oil heaters. HEALTH EDUCATION Apart from the health education given by all members of the staff during their routine visits, the following subjects have been dealt with. (i) Talks were given by the Medical Officer of Health: to an old age pensions association on Home Safety; to infant welfare clinic parents on Infectious Diseases; and to a secondary boys school on the Work of the Medical Officer of Health. The Chief Public Health Inspector gave two talks to political organisations, on the work of the Public Health Inspectors. (ii) Poster displays were run 6n Coughs and Sneezes in January and December; and on Poliomyelitis in May and September. Posters on Food Hygiene were obtained in July for distribution in food premises by the Public Health Inspectors. In July assistance was given to the Divisional Medical Officer's drive for Home Helps, by a display of posters. Publicity in connection with the Mass Miniature Radiography Unit's visit to Worcester Park was given in November. During the year arrangements were made for getting Venereal Disease posters displayed in the conveniences at railway stations within the Borough. (iii) Articles were written by the Medical Officer of Health in a ratepayers' gazette on Winter Infections; The Importance of Clean Food; The Present Position of Tuberculosis; Accidents in the Home (II); and the Mental Health Services. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS Eighty six medical examinations of staff were undertaken during the year, consisting of seventy two for superannuation purposes and fourteen sick pay cases for reports to the Establishment Committee. 7 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 Section 17 (Removal of Persons in Seed of Care and Attention) No action was necessary under this Section of the Act. Nine old persons were brought to notice for the first time in 1960 as possibly being in need of care and attention, and were visited. Of these, four were able to manage at home, four were admitted to hospital, and one was admitted to an old persons home. Eleven aged persons already known continued under observation from the previous year. Nine remained at home, and one of these died during the year. The other two were admitted to hospital. Section 50 (Burial and Cremation of the Dead) One burial was arranged under the powers granted to the Council by this Section. MORTUARY During 1960, two hundred and two bodies were admitted and underwent post mortem examination. Ninety two of the bodies were admitted from hospitals, and nine from other local authority areas. NEW MORTUARY The new mortuary came into operation on the 27th December, and the last three bodies were examined in it. The conditions and facilities available are the best that can be provided for this type of work. LABORATORIES The Public Health Laboratory, Epsom, served the Borough for bacteriological examinations. This service is supplemented by the use of the laboratories at Sutton and Cheam Hospital and St. Helier Hospital. Approximately seven hundred and forty specimens connected with infectious diseases were submitted to the laboratories during the year. It is with regret that I learn that Dr. D.M. Stone of Epsom Public Health Laboratory will be retiring at the end of March, 1961, and I would like to record my appreciation of the high standard of service that has been received from this Laboratory under her direction. CLINICS Details of the clinics available in the district are given at the end of this report. (Pages 53-54) 8 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply. The water supply is mainly derived from the deep wells in the chalk of the Sutton District Water Company situated at Sutton, Cheam and Woodmansteme. A small area in the North Ward is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board. A new reservoir, the North Looe, was brought into operation during the year. The water from all the wells of the Sutton District Water Company is softened to under nine degrees of hardness. A high dose of chlorine in the form of chloramine is administered to the water as a protective measure. Most of it is removed later, leaving a small residual chloramine to pass out to public distribution. The water is not liable to be plumbo-solvent. Almost thirty five gallons of water per person per day were supplied in 1960, of which approximately six and a half gallons were supplied to trade, and twenty eight gallons were used domestically. As opposed to 1959, rainfall in 1960 was 20.4 per cent, above the average. Samples of the raw and treated waters are examined daily by the laboratory at the Sutton Works. Samples are also examined at monthly intervals by the Company's Consultant Analyst, and copies of his reports are received. Twenty four bacteriological and twelve chemical samples are taken annually by five District Councils in the area of supply (two bacteriological and one chemical per month, in rotation). No action was necessary in respect of contamination during the year. The supply from all sources has been satisfactory in guality and guantity. All the dwelling houses have a direct supply from the public mains, as follows:- (a) Twenty five thousand, two hundred and twenty eight houses, with a population of seventy nine thousand, eight hundred and fifty, are supplied to a tap directly into the house. (b) Five houses, with a population of ten, are supplied by stand-pipes. The Sutton District Water Company supply twenty four thousand, seven hundred and eighty nine dwellings, and the remaining four hundred and forty four dwellings are supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board. The following is the average of monthly analyses:- Chemical Results in Parts per Million Average Appearance Bright with a slight white deposit of minute particles of calcium carbonate. Turbidity Less than 3 Colour Nil Odour Nil pH 8.19 F ree Carbon Dioxide 0.58 Electric Conductivity 271.66 9 Chemical Results in Parts per Million Average Dissolved Solids dried at 180° C 204.58 Chlorine present as Chloride 19.42 Alkalinity as Calcium Carbonate 58.75 Hardness (grains per gallon) - Carbonate 4.13 Non-carbonate 3.9 Total 8.03 Nitrate Nitrogen 10.48 Nitrite Nitrogen 0.0 Ammoniacal Nitrogen 0.12 Albuminoid Nitrogen 0.0 Oxygen Absorbed 0.06 Residual Chlorine 0.18 Metals - Iron, Zinc, Copper and Lead Absent Bacteriological Results No. of colonies developing on Agar per ml for 3 days at 20° C 1.09 No. of colonies developing on Agar per ml. for 1 day at 37° C. 0.0 Presence of Bacillus Coli in 100 ml 0.0 Swimming Baths There are two public swimming baths in Sutton and Cheam. The Maiden Road Bath, Cheam, was opened in 1938, and so is reasonably modern. It is open between April and September, and in Winter it is converted into a fine public hall. The Throwley Road Bath, Sutton, is much older and has changing cubicles round the sides of the bath. It is open all the year round. Maiden Road Bath Throwley Road Bath Maximum Clothes Accommodation 312 250 Quantity of Water 150,000 gallons 70,000 gallons Treatment Cycle Time 3½ hours 3½ hours Both work on a continuous cycle of pressure filtration and chlorination, the actual water being emptied out once a year and the Baths being refilled with mains water. Records are kept at both Baths showing the number of bathers, water temperature and residual chlorine levels at various times during the day and from these it was clear that an adeguate degree of chlorination was being maintained. Five bacteriological and one chemical sample were taken from the Throwley Road Bath, and four bacteriological and one chemical sample from Maiden Road Bath. The nine bacteriological samples were all reported as being satisfactory, and the two chemical samples were reported to be excellent. In addition, there is a learner swimming bath at Avenue Road County Primary School, Belmont Rise, Belmont. Owing to the very poor weather conditions prevailing during the Summer months, the pool was in use only intermittently from the beginning of May to the end of July, and was used only once or twice during the month of September. The pool was emptied 10 and refilled with mains water on three occasions during the Summer months. A small pressure filter and chlorinator was in use and a complete circulation of water was obtained every eight hours. Owing to the infrequent use of the pool, only one sample of the water was taken for bacteriological examination, which was found to be satisfactory. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE Worcester Park Sewage Disposal Works. It was not possible to proceed with the cleaning out of the existing sludge digestion tank and the repair of the mechanism therein during 1960, and it is now intended that this will be carried out during 1961. The design of Stage III of the Reconstruction Scheme including the construction of a Generating Station and the construction of a Low Level Pumping Station is nearing completion and it is anticipated that work will commence during 1961. The effluent being discharged to the Beverley Brook is of reasonable quality. Sutton Sewage Disposal Works. During the year work has been carried out to old tanks to enable a tertiary treatment system to be operated. This has resulted in an effluent of very good quality being discharged to the Pylbrook. Drainage. No major work of sewerage has been carried out during the year, but it is anticipated that during 1961 work will take place on the following Schemes Relief surface water sewer for a portion of the High Street, Sutton; relief surface water sewer in Morden Way; soil sewer in Cuddington Way; and soil sewer from Ventnor Road to Downs Road, Belmont. Rivers and Streams. The streams within the Borough have been maintained in a satisfactory condition. Refuse Collection and Cleansing. The collection and disposal of house refuse, together with the cleansing of public highways, is carried out under the supervision of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor. The controlled refuse tip at Ridge Road was closed in September on completion of the Council's refuse transfer depot. Mitcham Corporation deliver all the refuse from their area to the transfer station where the Mitcham and Sutton refuse is loaded into bulk haulage vehicles which then convey the refuse to a tip outside the Borough. Closet Accommodation. There is only one cesspool in use in the Borough, and one septic tank. In the past thirty-two years, one hundred and sixty two premises, originally with cesspool drainage, have been connected to sewers. Only two pail closets and three chemical closets are in use, not including those in temporary use on new building sites. 11 SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA Report of the Chief Public Health Inspector under Regulation 25 (20) of the Public Health Officers Regulations, 1959.

Six families, consisting of a total of 14 persons, were rehoused by the Corporation, and one family found other accommodation on their own initiative. The eighth house was unoccupied when the official representation was made on the 21st July, 1959. (B) 25 to 43 (odd), Malden Road, Cheam The houses in this 'Clearance Area', acquired by the Borough Council in 1959, were still in occupation at the year-end. However, tenders have now been invited for the works involved in the redevelopment scheme, and it is anticipated that the occupants will be accommodated in the new dwellings as the works proceed and the area cleared in 1961. 5. Housing Act, 1957 - Sections 16 and 17 (A) 17 and 19, Ling field Road, Worcester Park The occupiers of No .1.7, Lingfield Road were rehoused by the Borough Council, and both houses demolished during the year. No. 19 had been empty for some time. (B) 2, Elm Villas, Clarence Road and 64, Robin Hood Lane, Sutton The above-mentioned semi-detached houses were considered on the 26th April 1960 by the Borough Council as being unfit for human habitation and not capable at a reasonable expense of being rendered so fit. Appropriate notices were served on the owners under Section 16 of the Act, and in the absence of undertakings being given Demolition Orders were made by the Borough Council. The occupiers were rehoused by the Council, and both houses subsequently demolished down to first floor level by the owners. (C) 5, 7 and 9, Maiden Road, Cheam These houses were considered on the 27th September, 1960 by the Borough Council as being unfit for human habitation and not capable at a reasonable expense of being rendered so fit. It was also reported that the owners were willing to give an undertaking as to the future use of the houses, and the Council decided to accept such an undertaking. The Minister of Housing and Local Government had placed these houses on the Supplementary List (Grade 3) of buildings in the Borough which, whilst not regarded as possessing a sufficient degree of architectural or historic interest to merit inclusion in the Statutory List, were regarded as possessing sufficient interest to justify their being borne in mind. However, the County Planning Committee are now of the opinion 15 that a Building Preservation Order should be made in respect of these premises together with the adjacent historical buildings known as "Whitehall" and "Nonsuch Cottage", but if an appropriate form of development could be negotiated on the land at the rear of the properties there would be no objection to the demolition of Nos. 5, 7 and 9, Maiden Road. Further re-development plans are now awaited. (D) 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15, Park Road, Cheam These dwellings comprise a terrace of five wooden constructed houses and a vacant shop, probably erected in the seventeenth century. Nos. 7, 9, 11 and 13 Park Road had been placed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government on the Supplementary List (Grade 3) of buildings in the Borough referred to in (C) above. An official representation was made to the Borough Council on the 27th September, 1960 in respect of the five houses, as being unfit for human habitation and not capable at a reasonable expense of being rendered so fit. It was decided to accept an undertaking from the owners as to the future use of the houses, two of which were unoccupied at the year-end. 6 Housing Act, 1957 - Section 157 (A) 125, 127, 129, 131 and 131a, Cheam Common Road and 1 and 3, Woodbine Lane, Worcester Park Consideration was given by the Borough Council on the 22nd November 1960 to official reports submitted regarding the above-mentioned properties consisting of six houses and a vacant shop. The dwellings were stated to be unfit for human habitation and incapable of being rendered so fit at a reasonable expense, but as it was understood that the owners were willing to negotiate for the sale of the properties to the Borough Council, decision was deferred and instructions given that the District Valuer be asked to negotiate with the owners on the basis of his previous report. On the 20th December, 1960 the Borough Council recommended, after having considered the District Valuer's report and valuation of these houses together with Nos. 5 & 7 Woodbine Lane, that all the properties be purchased at an inclusive price, subject to a loan being obtained from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. (B) 5, 7, 9 and 11, Wilcox Road, Sutton An official representation was made to the Borough Council on the 20th December, 1960 in respect of these four houses, (two of which are of back-to-back construction) as being unfit for human habitation and not capable at a reasonable expense of being rendered so fit. It was decided, as the owner was willing to sell these properties to the Corporation, to defer consideration of the reports, pending the outcome of negotiations between the owner and District Valuer on behalf of the Council. 7 Housing Act, 1957 - Part IV Overcrowding (a) (1) Number of dwellings overcrowded at the year-end 55 16 (2) Number of families dwelling therein 114 (3) Number of persons dwelling therein (i.e. Equivalent number of adults) 335 (b) Number of new cases of overcrowding reported during the year 36 (c) (1) Number of cases of overcrowding relieved 21 (2) Number of persons concerned in such cases (i.e. Equivalent number of adults) 67 (d) Particulars of any case in which dwelling houses had again become overcrowded after the local authority had taken steps for the abatement of overcrowding Nil These figures are based on the known cases of statutory overcrowding, and are obtained from cases discovered during routine inspections of dwellings, applications made for Council housing accommodation, and on information received in the Department, all of which have been checked by your Inspectoral Staff at the year-end. During the year 304 visits were made to dwelling-houses in respect of overcrowding enquiries and permitted number of occupants. The 21 cases of overcrowding abated were relieved by the following means:- (a) Rehoused by the Borough Council 3 (b) Reduction in the number of occupants 2 (c) Other accommodation obtained on own initiative 16 8 GRANTS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OR CONVERSION OF HOUSES Section 20 of the Housing Act, 1949 empowered local authorities to make grants, at their discretion, for the improvement of dwellings by the provision of such amenities as a bath, hot water system, water closet, food storage facilities, etc., and for the conversion of houses into flats. The Borough Council decided to operate the scheme in October, 1954. The House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, which came into force in May, 1959, added a new kind of grant (Standard Grant) to which an owner is entitled as of right provided certain preliminary conditions are complied with. The following is a summary of applications for grants received and dealt with by the Borough Council up to 31st December, 1960 as supplied by the Town Clerk 17 Applications Received Discretionary Conversions Standard Total From inception of the scheme to 31st December, 1960 160 28 52 240 During 1960 26 3 34 63 Withdrawn, ineligible or not granted From inception 23 15 8 46 During 1960 4 1 5 10 Approved From inception 135 13 41 189 During 1960 20 2 26 48 Outstanding at 31st December 1960 2 0 3 5 Total grants paid to 31st December 1960, £21,612.9.8d.

The main effect of the Act was to free from rent control houses and flats with rateable values exceeding £40 in the Metropolitan Police District, and the City of London, or over £30 elsewhere in England and Wales, and to allow limited increases in the rents of houses and flats still under rent control. The Act has the general objective of enabling rented properties to be put in repair, of increasing the total stock of rented accommodation and of securing a better use of existing housing accommodation. The following summary shews the number of applications received for 'Certificates of Disrepair', and for the cancellation thereof during the period 6th July 1957 to 31st December, 1960. 18 (A) Applications for Certificates of Disrepair From 6.7.1957 to end of 1960 1960 only Number of applications received 136 8 " decisions not to issue certificates, - - "" applications withdrawn 8 - " decisions to issue certificates 128 9 (a) in respect of some, but not all defects 102 8 (b) in respect of all defects 26 1 Number of undertakings given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule (Form K) 73 6 Number of undertakings refused by Local Authority under proviso to paragraph 5 of the First Schedule 1 1 Number of certificates of disrepair issued (1 application withdrawn after service of Form 5) 55 4 (B) Applications for Cancellation of Certificates Number of applications received 27 3 Number of objections to cancellation received 6 2 Number of certificates cancelled 22 1 Number of objections to cancellation upheld 5 2 Number cancelled in spite of tenant's objection 1 - PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1936 - WORKPLACES Inspections Number of written Occupiers and verbal notices prosecuted 71 5 - CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 Stroke Abatement and Atmospheric Pollution There are but few industrial chimneys in the Borough. Six complaints of smoke emission were received and dealt with during the year, 3 of these were in respect of bonfires, two from heating appliances in industrial premises, and one in respect of an incinerator. Grit Deposit Measuring Gauges In conjunction and with the co-operation of the Department of Scientific & Industrial Research, the grit deposit measuring gauges have been maintained and samples collected monthly for analytical examination. The following is a summary of the results obtained during the year:- 19 MONTH Gauge No 2 Gauge No. 6 Gauge No. 7 Rainfall in inches Total Solids (Tons per sq.mile) Rainfall in inches Total Solids (Tons per sq. mile) Rainfall in inches Total Solids (Tons per sq. mile) January 1.96 7.12 2.32 6.49 1.82 6.56 February 1.77 11 .86 2.11 10.61 1.61 9.34 March 1.78 13.52 2.10 10.50 1.75 11.40 April 0.98 11.56 0.92 8.79 0.61 6.70 May 2.01 13.23 2.05 23.05 1.95 10.54 June 1.09 10.41 1.36 9.78 1.30 15.97 July 3.50 9.11 2.85 12.81 3.28 7.06 August 2.87 6.93 3.10 5.60 4.29 8.68 September 2.91 10.67 2.83 8.56 2.76 9.67 October 5.28 13.69 5.92 13.11 4.90 10.24 November 4.00 9.45 4.57 10.70 3.26 4.87 December 2.93 9.87 3.34 9.29 1.76 6.66 Yearly Totals 31.08 127.42 33.47 129.29 29.29 107.69 Monthly Average 2.59 10.62 2.79 10.77 2.44 8.97 The Borough is adequately covered by the three grit deposit gauges which are sited roughly 1½ miles apart. DAILY MEAN CONCENTRATION OF SMOKE AND SULPHUR DIOXIDE A smoke filter and volumetric sulphur dioxide apparatus was installed in Manor Park House after consulting the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research as to the suitability of the site. A daily record has been kept since the 1st November, 1958 of the amount of smoke or suspended matter and sulphur dioxide in the air. It has long been recognised that a distinction must be drawn between relatively coarse particles of solid matter which are quickly deposited by their own weight, and which comprise most of the particulate matter collected in the deposit gauge, and the very fine particles which settle slowly, if at all. These fine particles, commonly referred to as 'smoke', are less than about 20 microns (0.002 cm) in size and consist largely of carbonaceous matter, including tar, produced by the incomplete combustion of coal; some fine ash is also included. It is important to realise that little of this fine material is collected in the deposit gauge which in consequence gives no information about pollution by smoke. To obtain such information a smoke filter is necessary. 20 The following table gives a summary of the daily readings taken during the year 1960. The 1959 annual figures are shewn for comparison purposes at the foot of the table. Smoke (Milligrams per 100 cu metres) Sulphur Dioxide (Parts per 100 million) Highest.

The maximum proportion of whiskey in the article was such that one would have to eat over 17 lbs. of the chocolate in order to consume the equivalent of one small whiskey. Cautioned The importers were informed of the infringements, and an agreement had been reached on having new labels printed bearing the words Flavoured with Genuine Irish Whiskey instead of 'contains Genuine Irish Whiskey but specimens of the new labels had not been received for approval at the yearend. 2888 Creme Advocaat Labelling Infringements The wrappers in which tnese three samples of chocolate were contained implied the presence of alcohol, but on analysis were found to contain no alcohol, but only artifical flavouring. Cautioned After taking the matter up with the importers arrangements were made for the printing of new labels bearing the word 'Flavour' after the description of each article. 2889 Creme Mocha Rum 2890 (Informal) Creme Coffee & Brandy 2905 (Informal) Curd Cheese This article was found to consist of skimmed milk curd cheese fortified with a little cream, and contained only 4 4% of milk fat instead of 10% or more Cautioned A meeting was arranged with the manufacturers' representative, Public Analyst, and the Chief Public Health Inspector, when the infringement was fully discussed, but the matter had not been finalised at the year-end. 2915 (In formal) Mixed Cut Peel Labelling Infringements The ingredients of this article, and the name and address of the packer were not specified on the label contrary to the Labelling of Food Order, 1953 Cautioned The Packers made arrangements for the printing of new labels which would conform to the requirements of the Order. Sample No. Article Sampled Type of Infringement Action taken and Remarks 2927 (Informal) Sauerkraut Labelling Infringement Although this sample was found to be of genuine canned sauerkraut, it contained no Vitamin C, in spite of the fact that the label stated 'Our manufacturing process safeguards against loss of vitamins, so that our product is of superior taste and quality' Cautioned The Dutch manufacturers were notified by the importers of the infringement, and a request made for deletion of all reference to Vitamin content on the labels 2917 (Informal) Veal, Ham and Egg This article was sold as 'Veal, Ham and Egg' but was not labelled on exposure for sale It was found to consist of veal, ham and egg loaf, containing 72% meat and 12% cereal filler Cautioned Upon informing the retailer of the wrong description given to this article, it was shewn that the commodity had been invoiced as 'Veal, Ham and Egg Galantine' The Manager stated that the assistants had already been instructed to sell it as Galantine, and would give further instructions to always give the correct description to this article No further action was considered necessary 25 26 Sampling Observations It will be seen from the detailed classification that of two hundred and nineteen samples taken during the year 0.91% were found to be other than genuine and labelling infringements accounted for a further 2.74% making a total of 3.65% For comparative purposes the figures for 1959 were 1.38% and 2.29% respectively, making a total of 3.67% The pattern of sampling has followed that of previous years in that a wide range of commodities has been covered A satisfying result has emerged since the infringements revealed were generally of a minor character and with the willing co-operation of retailers, importers and/or manufacturers were usually readily adjusted. Comments by the Public Analyst Sampling of foods and drugs throughout the year has followed the usual general pattern, a wide variety of articles having been submitted. Basic foods have received their due attention and in addition many foods of an unusual character or for which special claims of one kind or another are made have been thoroughly investigated Imported foods prepacked in the country of origin or packed in this country on behalf of the manufacturer are on the increase On the whole these foods conform with British legal requirements as to composition and freedom from forbidden preservatives, colouring matters etc., and the labelling is also satisfactory. Many foods of a somewhat specialised and often expensive character appear on the market for a relatively short time, but do not become well established. It would appear that many people are prepared to try anything once, however unusual and costly it may be, but that afterwards they exercise normal judgment and the article sells to a large extent on its merits. There are exceptions to this rule as when the sales of an inferior article or one which is no better than its competitors are boosted by artificial means such as massive advertising on a national scale or by price cutting. In the absence of special claims it is not the function of the public analyst to discriminate between goods of various qualities provided the poorest quality does not fall below a minimum standard recognisable largely by commercial practice and consumer acceptability. Many people, however, would undoubtedly feel themselves prejudiced if sold an article of low quality at a high price and it may be possible in the future to devise a legal form of protection taking this into account. Quite independent of any variation in quality it is of importance to ensure that articles sold conform with the terms used to describe them It is becoming increasingly common to use the argument that a low price justified a misdescription and it is one which must be resisted. At the present time there are two categories of food in particular where the need to establish the true meaning of words is urgent These are are meat products and soft cheeses As to the former it must be recognised that where the description used is in terms of meat only, with no particular qualification there is no justification for the presence of flour or starch fillers with the consequent increase in water content and reduction of meat. For example an article described as veal and ham or chopped pork must consist almost entirely of meat with only the addition of a little gelatine as may be necessary to bind the cooked meat. An example of this misdescription was Sample No.2917 - Veal, Ham and Egg in which the veal and ham portion contained only 72 per cent of meat , the remainder being cereal filler and water (apart from a little seasoning). Ordinary soft cheeses made from milk or skimmed milk, are frequently misdescribed as cream cheese, whereas the latter term must be reserved for a natural cheese made directly from cream. The public cannot be expected to distinguish by appearance or taste between cheese made from milk and cheese made from skimmed or partly skimmed milk and it is essential that some suitable form of description be agreed. In the meantime, where the word cheese is used without a recognised qualification indicating removal of part of the fat, it must be assumed that the cheese is made from whole milk. Sample No.2905, which was described as 'Curd Cheese', is a case in point; This sample was prepared from skimmed milk with the addition of a little cream or butter, but only sufficient to give a fat content of just over 4 per cent. A cheese of similar water content made from milk without any addition of cream or butter would contain as much as 15 per cent of fat. Both the above categories of foods, canned meat products and soft cheeses, are now being considered by the Food Standards Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and it is to be hoped that satisfactory standards both of description and composition will ultimately be laid down. MILK SUPPLY Food and Drugs Act, 1955 Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations 1959 The Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations 1949 to 1954 The Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulation 1949 - 1953 The Borough of Sutton and Cheam is a specified area for the purpose of the Milk (Special Designations) (Specified Areas) Order 1951, therefore all milk sold in the Borough is designated milk. All milk distributors in the area are licensed to use the special designation in relation to the milk retailed, and are granted a dealer's supplementary licence for that purpose. Routine inspection of milk pasteuriser's and distributors' premises reveals that the provisions of the various Regulations are generally well observed. The following licences to sell graded milks in the Borough were issued in 1960. Grade of Milk TYPE OF LICENCE Dealers Supplementary Pasteuriser's Tuberculin Tested 29 11 - Pasteurised 33 11 1 Sterilised 33 12 - TOTAL 95 34 1 27 CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF MILK AND CREAM SAMPLES MILK Fifty-five formal and fifteen informal samples of milk were taken for chemical analysis; all of which were found to be genuine. Twenty-eight samples of 'Channel Island' and 'South Devon' milk contained satisfactory averages of 4.43% milk fat and 8.97% milk solids other than milk fat; and forty-two other samples of milk contained satisfactory averages of 3.51% milk fat and 8.66% milk solids other than milk fat. The results were well above the minimum standard of 4% milk fat laid down in the Milk and Dairies (Channel Islands and South Devon Milk) Regulations 1956; and of 3% milk fat and 8.5% milk solids other than milk fat required under The Sale of Milk Regulations 1939. CREAM Analysis of eight informal samples of cream showed three double cream samples to contain an average of 49.66% milk fat and five single cream samples a satisfactory average of 23.84% milk fat. The minimum standards in relation to cream are as follows 'double cream' not less than 48% by weight of milk fat, and 'other creams' described as single cream, pouring cream, coffee cream, fruit cream, or as any other description of cream - not less than 18% by weight of milk fat. To comply with the Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, Tuberculin Tested Milk must not decolourise Methylene Blue within 4Vi hours if the sample is taken during 1st May to 31st October, or within 5lA hours if taken between 1st November and 30th April. 28 BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF MILK SAMPLES One hundred and sixteen samples of milk were examined as follows:- Class of Milk Number of samples examined Type of Test applied Results Passed Failed Pasteurised 64 Phosphatase 64 - Methylene Blue 64 - Sterilised 8 Turbidity 8 - Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised 20 Phosphatase 20 - Methylene Blue 20 - Tuberculin Tested (Farm Bottled) 24 Methylene Blue 23 1 TOTALS 116 115 1 Of the total samples examined under these Regulations only one sample of Tuberculin Tested (Farm Bottled) Milk failed to pass the prescribed test. This sample was taken during the 4½ hours test period and decolourised Methylene Blue in 3 hours. It is the practice immediately to notify failures of farm bottled milk to the dairy company concerned so that the matter may be taken up with the responsible producers as speedily as possible. To comply with the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) and Pasteurised Milk must not give a reading of more than 2.3 Lovibond blue units in the phosphatase test and must not decolourise methylene blue in 30 minutes. The 84 samples examined under these Regulations were all found to be satisfactory. MILK AND DAIRIES The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations 1960 Mention may be made of these Regulations which will come into force on the 1st January, 1961, insofar as they relate to dealers licences, but which came into operation insofar as they relate to producers licences on the 1st October, 1960. The Regulations consolidate and re-enact with amendments the Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations 1949 to 1954, and the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations 1949 to 1953. The principal changes include the following:- (a) Dealers licences except for a few kinds which will be granted by the Minister of Agriculture Fisheries and Food, will be granted by the food and drugs authority for the area within which are situated the premises at or from which the milk is to be pasteurised, sterilised or sold as the case may be; dealer's licences will permit sales outside as well as inside the area of the licensing authority and supplementary licences are to be discontinued. (b) A dealer's (pre-packed) Milk licence is introduced to permit the sale of all three kinds of specially designated milk, where milk is obtained by a dealer in a container in which it is to be supplied to the customer, or is pasteurised or sterilised by the dealer. (c) The period for which a dealer's licence will be granted is extended from one year to five years. ICE CREAM Food and Drugs Act, 1955 Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations, 1959 Food Standards (Ice Cream) Regulations, 1959 Registrations During the year twelve applications for the registration of premises for the sale and storage of ice cream were received and granted. 29 At the end of 1960 a total of one hundred and sixty-six premises had been registered for the sale of ice cream in accordance with Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, and on three of these premises ice cream could be manufactured. BACTERIOLOGICAL SAMPLING OF ICE CREAM During the year seventy-four samples of ice cream were obtained for bacteriological examination and provisional grading. The following table shows the 1960 percentage results in each grade and for comparative purposes the results obtained in 1959.

The regulations prescribe amended standards for ice cream and for "Parev" (Kosher) ice and introduce separate standards for dairy ice cream (or dairy cream ice or cream ice) and for milk ice. 30 The standards for dairy ice cream and for milk ice provide that they shall contain no fat other than milk fat except such as may be introduced by the use of any egg, any flavouring substance or any emulsifying or stabilising agent. The requirement in the 1953 Order that ice cream should contain not less than 10% of sugar is replaced by a provision that no type of ice cream shall contain any artificial sweetener. Alternative standards are prescribed for certain descriptions of ice cream containing fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree. The standard of composition for ice cream is now as follows:- (a) Ice cream shall contain not less than 5% fat and 7½% milk solids other than fat. (b) Ice cream containing any fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree shall either conform to (a) above or, alternatively the total content of fat and milk solids other than fat shall be not less than 12½% of the whole including the fruit etc. and such total content of fat and milk solids other than fat shall include not less than 7½% fat and 2% milk solids other than fat. (c) Dairy Ice Cream, Dairy Cream Ice, or Cream Ice shall in each case contain not less than 5% milk fat and no other fat (except as mentioned in second paragraph above), and not less than 7½% milk solids other than fat. (d) Milk Ice or Milk Ice containing fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree shall contain not less than 2½% milk fat and no other fat (save as mentioned in second paragraph above), and not less than 7% milk solids other than fat. Twelve samples of locally produced ice cream were submitted tc chemical examination during the year and found to contain constituent percentages well above the prescribed standard, as under:- Sample No. Constituent Percentages Fat Milk Solids other than fat 2806 8.7 12.6 2818 6.1 8.3 2833 7.7 10.8 2844 6.9 9.9 2845 11.6 11.7 2859 7.2 12.5 2876 5.5 8.5 2877 12.2 13.3 2884 8.16 11.7 2895 6.2 9.5 2914 7.8 13.6 2926 11.7 15.8 Average 8.3 1 11.5 31 32 ICE LOLLIES BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION There is no prescribed standard for water ices or ice lollies sold as such, but as in former years ice lolly samples have been submitted to a test similar to the one applied to ice cream. Thirty-six lollies were examined and found to be satisfactory. FOOD & DRUGS ACT, 1955 FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1960 These regulations which came into operation on the 1st October, 1960, amend and consolidate the Food Hygiene Regulations 1955 to 1957. A number of amendments have been embodied in the general provisions of the Regulations in the light of the experience gained since they first came into operation. The most important of these amendments are described below:- (a) The term "catering business" has been introduced into regulations 25(2) (temperature at which certain foods are to be kept) and 28(1) (supply of water to stalls), in order to indicate more clearly the type of business to which these requirements apply. (b) The definition of "meat" has been extended to include rabbits, game and poultry. (c) The scope of the expression "handling of food" is widened so that the obligation of food handlers will in future extend to persons who wash up or clean food equipment (d) Herbal smoking mixture and snuff are now included with tobacco, which a person engaged in the handling of food shall refrain from using whilst he is handling open food or is in any food room in which there is open food. (e) Regulation 26 as amended makes it clear that food transport and delivery vehicles have to be kept clean and in good condition, and suitably and sufficiently lighted when being cleaned. A proviso has been aded to permit the driving compartment of a stall or vehicle to be used as a sleeping place if it is effectively separated from the food compartment. The following is a summary of the number of food premises in the Borough:- Bakehouses 12 Butchers (including one horseflesh shop) 56 Confectioners (sugar and flour) 180 Fishmongers/Stalls/Fried Fish Shops 30 General Stores/Shops 18 Greengrocers/Stall/Stores 84 Grocers 133 Ice Cream (Manufacture and sale of) 181 Licensed Public Houses 33 Milk Purveyors/Depots/Dairies 39 Restaurants/Cafes/Snack Bars/Dining Rooms 62 School and Industrial Canteens/Kitchens/ Service Rooms 44 Other Food Premises 13 TOTAL 885 During the year 1677 visits were made to food business premises, 86 notices were served in connection with the 166 infringements discovered as detailed in the following table:- Food Hygiene Regulations Number of Infringements found in 1960 Number of Infringements rectified in 1960, including infringements discovered in 1959, but rectified in 1960 Regulntion No. 5 1 1 „ 6 6 11 „ 8 9 12 „ 9 2 5 „ 10 1 1 „ 12 1 1 „ 14 42 38 „ 15 2 2 „ 16 21 32 „ 17 8 5 „ 18 2 7 „ 19 5 7 „ 20 - 1 „ 21 - 1 „ 23 59 59 „ 24 - 1 „ 25 - 1 „ 26 6 9 „ 28 - 1 „ 29/30 1 1 TOTAL 166 196 It is gratifying to record that the majority of the traders continue to show a willing co-operation to comply with the requirements of the Regulations. Mention must also be made that the standard of hygiene in the various food premises and the cleanliness of the persons engaged in the handling of food is much improved. Prosecutions Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955 to 1960 No proceedings were taken during the year under the Regulations. Complaints Regarding Food Unfit for Human Consumption The following is a summary of various complaints received and investigated during the year. The general circumstances of these cases did not warrant legal proceedings being taken, but the merits of each case were considered and appropriate action taken where necessary. 33 Brush bristle in loaf Confectionery - damaged by fire at premises Currant in loaf - thought to be rodent dropping Dirty loaf - external Dirty milk bottles - 4 Glass in crumpet - from complainants own butter dish Grease deposits in bread - 3 Jute fibres in loaf Larvae in packeted rice Meat - transported in boot of private car Moth larvae in chocolate Paraffin smell in milk bottle Pieces of old dough in loaf Strip of paper in milk bottle Sultana skin in loaf Tainted fish Tainted lamb Wood splinter in loaf REGISTERED FOOD PREMISES The following table shows the number of food premises registered by type of business, and the number of inspections made:- A.

Slaughter of Animals Act, 1958 One licence to act as slaughterman was granted in 1960. Bakehouses There are thirteen bakehouses in the Borough, with one exception, all are provided with mechanical power. The standard of cleanliness and the sanitary conditions in the majority of cases were found to be satisfactory. Sixteen visits of inspection were made during the year. Shops Act Six hundred and seventy-five visits were made to various premises under the Shops Act and revealed that the arrangements made for the health and comfort of the shop workers are in the majority of cases satisfactory. Schools The sanitary conditions and the water supply to the Schools in the area are generally satisfactory. Hairdressers' and Barbers' Premises There are sixty-nine establishments in the Borough. Sixty-three inspections were made during the year, and the premises generally were found to conform to the requirements of the Hairdressers and Barbers Bye-laws 1947. Merchandise Marks Act One hundred and eighty-six visits were made to food premises under this Act. The infringements discovered were principally in connection with the marking of imported applies, tomatoes and dead poultry. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 The intention of the Act is to secure the use of clean filling material in upholstered articles, and other articles which are stuffed or lined. The Act provides for the registration of certain premises by the Local Authority on payment of a registration fee and the licensing of certain other premises on payment of a statutory fee. One application for renewal of Licence to store rag flock was received and granted in 1960. 36 Pet Animals Act, 1951 This Act came into operation on 1st April, 1952 and provides that no person shall keep a pet shop except under the authority of a licence granted by the Local Authority in accordance with the provisions of the Act and on payment of a fee not exceeding ten shillings. Twenty-three visits of inspection were made during the year. Six licence renewal applications and two new applications for licences were received and granted during 1960 Licensed Places of Public Entertainment There are seventeen licensed places of public entertainment in the Borough. They are used mainly for cinematograph shows, concerts, dancing and social functions. The general standard of cleanliness was good. Licensed Public Houses Twenty-nine visits of inspection were made to the 33 licensed public houses in the Borough. As a result of the Food Hygiene Regulations a considerable number of improvements have been carried out at many public houses. These include the provision of additional or improved sanitary conveniences, washbasins, hot water supply, improved ventilation to kitchens, bars and cellars, and the more general use of detergents and sterilising agents for the washing of utensils, beer pipe lines and pumps. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952 Sixteen visits were made to premises which sold heating appliances. These involved the carrying out of numerous Jests on the many types and designs of heaters offered for sale. No infringements of the Act were discovered. Noise Abatement Act, 1960 Under section 1 of this Act which came into operation on the 27th November, 1960, noise or vibration which would amount to a nuisance at common law becomes a statutory nuisance which can be dealt with according to the procedure provided in part III of the Public Health Act, 1936. Local Authorities will under this procedure be able to reguire the abatement of a noise or vibration nuisance by the service of an abatement notice on the person causing the nuisance or on the owner or occupier of premises on which it arises and if the notice is not complied with it can be enforced by proceedings in a magistrates court. Apart from action by a local authority, three or more occupiers of land or premises who are aggrieved by a noise or vibration nuisance may make a complaint to a magistrate. 37 Section 2 of the Act deals with the use of loudspeakers in streets. It prohibits their use for any purpose between 9 p.m and 8 a.m. (except in special circumstances) and at any other time for advertising any trade, business or entertainment with the exception that between noon and 7 pm. a loudspeaker fixed to a vehicle used for the sale of perishable foodstuffs may be operated to announce that the commodities are for sale. The loudspeaker is, however, not to be so operated as to give reasonable cause for annoyance to persons in the vicinity. One complaint of vibration has been received and investigated since the Act came into operation, but was not confirmed Disinfection and Disinfestation Council Private Other Houses Houses Premises Number of houses treated with insecticide for bugs and fleas 4 11 - Twelve school canteen kitchens and eight hospital kitchens were sprayed for flies, ants and moths. The insecticides used were Pybuthrin, D.D.T Residual and Municipal Spray, Gammexane Liquid Spray, Zaldecide M. Powder and Fumex Fumigators. RODENT CONTROL The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 A. Surface Treatments (1) Five thousand one hundred and fifty-four visits were made during the year by the Rodent Operator and One thousand, one hundred and sixty by the Public Health Inspectors to premises infested or possibly harbouring rats or mice. Five hundred and seventy premises were cleared of rats or mice no major infestations were recorded. (2) The work for the year is generally summarised as under:- Complaints received or cases discovered and investigated 565 Number of premises found to be infested 555 Number of premises where no evidence of rodents found 10 Number of premises cleared of rats or mice (including 97 previous year's cases) 570 Number of premises still being treated at the year end 82 (3) The cause or site of infestation at the 555 infested premises was:- Keeping of poultry 5 Inside premises (under floors etc.) - rats 28 Inside premises (under floors etc,) - mice 54 Buries, scrapes etc , in gardens land etc 288 Under or inside sheds 180 Defective drains 15 TOTAL 570 38 (4) Type of premises found to be infested: - With Rats With Mice Total Council Property 7 5 12 Dwellinghouses 442 20 462 Business Premises, etc 29 15 44 Schools, Hospitals, Canteens etc 10 22 32 Land 5 - 5 TOTAL 493 62 555 (5) Summary of the type of premises and methods employed in clearing premises of rats and mice:- Type of Premises Cleared Dwellinghouses (mainly in gardens) 475 Food shops and food premises 27 Non-food shops 15 Waste land and building sites 9 Hospitals and Schools 17 Factories and Workplaces 5 Council Premises (other than dwellings) 12 Miscellaneous 10 TOTAL 570 (6) Methods employed in clearing 570 premises of rats and mice. Warfarin and other Poison Baits 561 Rat and Mouse Proofing 2 Drains repaired 7 TOTAL 570 B Sewer Treatments (1) Treatments for 1959/60 In the Annual Report for the year 1959 details were given of the experimental rat control treatments which were to be carried out in two areas of the Borough, by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food The areas chosen for the experiment consisted of (a) The "Sutton Area" enclosed by the Carshalton and Cheam Roads, the St Heller and Wimbledon Branch line of the British Railways, All Saints Road, Benhill Road, St Barnabas Road, and, (b) The "Worcester Park Area" enclosed by London Road, Tudor Avenue, Sandr.ngham Road Lynwood Drive, Green Lane, Browning Ave nue, Ebbisham Road Burnham Drive. 39 Following the census on 30 selected manholes in each of these two. areas in November, 1959, when it was shown that substantial numbers of rats infested the sewers; the Ministry commenced the first poison treatment in the "Sutton Area" on the 31st December, 1959, using the acute (quick acting) poison sodium fluoracetate with damp sausage rusk as a base. The second treatment in this area was commenced on the 29th March, 1960 the same poison being used but this time pin head oatmeal and water were provided as a base. The first treatment in the "Worcester Park Area" commenced on the 4th January, 1960, the poison used on this occasion was the acute poison fluoracetimide with damp sausage rusk as a base. The second treatment in this area was commenced on the 2nd April, 1960, again the poison used was fluoracetimide this time with pin head oatmeal and water as a base. On the 6th April, 1960, a post census of the 30 manholes in each of the two areas was carried out and the result showed that all rats had been exterminated. The following is a summary of the results and treatments carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from November, 1959 to April, 1960.

The work commenced with the test baiting of 181 selected manholes in the Borough including the two areas already dealt with by the Ministry. The result of this test revealed that 38 manholes were infested with rats. The first maintenance treatment 1960/61 (Treatment No. 27) was commenced on the 21st November, 1960 and continued until the 14th December, 1960. The anticoagulant poison Warfarin 0.5% Master Mix was used with pin head oatmeal, technical white oil, castor sugar and para-nitrophenol (mould inhibitor) as a base. The results achieved were very encouraging, rebaiting and reexamination of manholes taking place until all rats had been exterminated. The following is a summary of the results obtained by treatments carried out by the Sutton and Cheam Public Health Department Staff during September/December, 1960.

Scarlet Fever. One hundred and sixty six cases were notified in 1960, as against two hundred and ninety four in 1959. The incidence was highest in the first and second quarters of the year, there being seventy cases in the first quarter, fifty one in the second quarter, twenty three in the third quarter, and twenty two in the fourth quarter. The illness was generally mild and there were no deaths. The present less exacting control of Scarlet Fever, with its lesser interference with school attendance of cases and contacts, is probably justified whilst the illness remains so mild, although hindering prevention of spread. Diphtheria, No case was notified during the year. The last case in Sutton and Cheam occurred in 1951. Diphtheria Antitoxin The oossibility of Diphtheria must always be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of infections of the throat. The early injection of antitoxin is the only effective treatment of Diphtheria. Swabs for diagnosis should be taken before any antibiotic is administered. Any suspected cases should be admitted to isolation hospital at once for diagnosis and treatment. Diphtheria Immunisation. Outbreaks of Diphtheria occurred in several areas of the Country during 1960, including the London area. Diphtheria Immunisation is therefore still very necessary. Immunisation is safe, simple and effective. Every child should be immunised before the age of twelve months (and if triple antigen is used, immunisation should be started as early as the third month), with reinforcing doses at appropriate intervals thereafter. Immunisation is free of charge and can be arranged through the family doctor or at Child Welfare Clinics. During 1960, one thousand one hundred and fifty eight children received a primary course of immunisation, as follows:- Age: Under 1 1 2 3 4 5-9 10-14 Over 15 Total Number Immunised: 930 70 23 10 12 105 6 2 1158 In addition, seven hundred and forty three children received reinforcing injections. The following table shows the immunisation state of the local child population at the 31st December, 1960. 42 Number of children at 31st December 1960, who had completed a course of immunisation at any time between 1st January 1946 and 31st December, 1960.

Forty eight cases were notified in 1960, compared with thirteen hundred and six cases in 1959. There was no death. Thirty two of the cases were notified during the last quarter of the year. The monthly incidence of notified cases is shown in the following table:- January 2 July 0 February 1 August 4 March 1 September 1 April 1 October 2 May 0 November 29 June 6 December 1 Measles cases must be kept out of school for ten days after the appearance of the rash and may then return if the child is sufficiently well to do so. Contacts are not excluded except the under fives, who should be excluded for fourteen days from the date of appearance of the rash in the last case in the home. However, all contacts should be carefully scrutinised daily before being allowed to go to school, and should be excluded if suffering from a cough, cold, chill or red eyes. No child who is known for certain to have had the disease need be excluded. The illness can be prevented or modified by the injection of gamma globulin early in the incubation period. A small quantity is available to doctors for cases of special risk. 43 Health visitors are informed of notified cases of children under five years of age so that they may give advice where necessary. Whooping Cough Eighty three cases were notified in 1960, compared with thirty cases in 1959 There was no death Two-thirds of the cases were notified in the second and third quarters of the year. The monthly incidence of notified cases is shown in the following table:- January 3 July 12 February 6 August 11 March 5 September 1 April 2 October 4 May10 November 10 June 19 December 0 Whooping Cough is a serious infection in early infancy. The cough imposes a severe strain on the lung tissues. The danger of mortality is highest in the first three months of life and diminishes with age. Every effort should be made to protect babies and weakly infants from contact with infection. The vaccines give substantial protection. Immunisation should commence not later than three months of age. Cases are excluded from school for twenty eight days from the beginning of the characteristic cough. Child contacts under seven years of age should be excluded for twenty one days from the date of onset of a case in their home if they have not had the disease. Health Visitors are informed of notified cases of children under five years of age so that they may give advice where necessary. Immunisation against whooping Cough. Immunisation against Whooping Cough is available tree of charge for children under five years of age, either through the family doctor or at Child Welfare Clinics. In 1960, one thousand and forty three children received immunising injections Three injections of 1 c.c. are given at monthly intervals. The injections are given subcutaneously, either separately or combined with immunisation against Diphtheria, or Diphtheria and Tetanus. In addition, fifty eight children were given reinforcing injections during the year. Smallpox. No case was notified. Vaccination against Smallpox. The speed of travel has increased the risk of Smallpox being imported. Our protection depends on vaccination. There is no drug which will cure the illness. Vaccination is safest in infancy and provides a basal immun ity which can be reinforced later with reduced reaction. Vaccination is voluntary and free of charge and can be arranged through the family doctor or at the nearest Child Welfare Centre. It is, therefore, with some misgiving that I record the following reduced figures for Smallpox Vaccination in 1960. During the year, four hundred and seventy four babies under the age of one year were vaccinated. The percentage of 45.1 compares with 65 5 in 1959 and 62.9 in 1958 44 The following table shows the number of vaccinations during 1960 - Age Number Vaccinated Number Re-Vaccinated Under 1. 474 _ 1 32 - 2-4 19 11 5-14 23 33 Over 15 56 271 Totals 604 315 Puerperal Pyrexia Eight cases were notified in 1960, compared with twenty two in 1959. Only one case occurred at home. Puerperal Pyrexia is "any febrile condition occurring in a woman, in whom a temperature of 100.4° Fahrenheit (38° Centigrade) or more has occurred within fourteen days after childbirth or miscarriage". Tetanus. A scheme for the immunisation of children against Tetanus on reguest by parents is in operation. The Tetanus bacillus is present in horse manure and in manured land. Infection enters the body through contaminated wounds and abrasions which may be so slight as to escape notice. The object of immunisation is to prepare the tissues in advance to resist the Tetanus bacillus. All who work in agriculture or in stables should be immunised. Children are prone to abrasions and should be protected from the incidental risk of infection. At present it is a routine to inject anti-tetanic serum after wounds. This serum occasionally causes undesirable allergic reactions and its use can be avoided by precautionary immunisation with toxoid before injury. Immunisation against Tetanus can be given separately, or combined with immunisation against Diphtheria and Whooping Cough, and must be sustained by reinforcing injections at appropriate intervals. A record of the dates of injection should always be carried on the person. During 1960, one thousand and seventy five children received primary injections, and fifty two children received reinforcing injections. Food Poisoning Four cases were notified in 1960, compared with fifteen cases in 1959. All cases were in one family and were caused by Salmonella Typhimurium, The infection occurred during the Christmas period, with relatives present. It was not possible to identify the source of infection. The low incidence of infections due to Salmonellae and Staphylococci in food is satisfactory. Prevention of infection depends on scrupulous cleanliness in the production, storage, manufacture and distribution of food. The washing of hands after use of the W.C. is the most effective protective measure against intestinal carriers of infection. Early notification of cases of food poisoning is necessary so as to obtain the residue of suspected food for bacteriological examination. No food handler should ever be allowed to return to work without bacteriological clearance. Dysentery. There were forty seven cases of Dysentery. All were of the Sonne type. Fifteen cases occurred in connection with a small 45 nursery school outbreak in February. Twenty eight cases, involving twenty families, were sporadic, three cases occurred in connection with outbreaks outside the Borough, and one case occurred in a laboratory worker. Sonne Dysentery is a highly infectious form of gastro-enteritis The infection is spread by faecal contamination of hands, objects, and in particular, lavatory seats. Prevention depends on the washing of hands after use of the W.C. and on the efficient cleansing of communal W.C.'s in schools and public places. It is most desirable that all cases of diarrhoea should be checked bacteriologically. Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fevers. No case was notified. Meningococcal Infection. No case was notified. Poliomyelitis. 1960 was the second successive year the Borough has been free from this infection since 1944. The number of cases in England and Wales generally also declined still further during this year. As it seems very probable that poliomyelitis vaccination is largely responsible, all persons under the age of forty should seek protection in order that this happy state may long continue. During the year approximately two thousand, six hundred and ninety four persons were vaccinated against Poliomyelitis in the following groups. (1) Persons born 1942 - 1960 1006 (2) Persons born 1933 - 1941 236 (3) Persons born 1920 - 1932 1320 (4) Other priority groups 132 In addition, seven thousand, five hundred and thirty four persons received third injections. Acute Encephalitis. One case of Post-infectious Encephalitis occurred in a man of forty four, twelve days after an attack of Chicken Pox. He was admitted to hospital, but recovery was uneventful. Pneumonia. There were forty five deaths from Pneumonia in 1960, compared with forty three in 1959. Nine cases of Pneumonia were notified in 1960, compared with sixty seven in 1959. Two were cases of Influenzal Pneumonia. Non-Notifiable Diseases. School teachers reported two hundred and nineteen cases of Mumps, three hundred and fifty four cases of Chicken Pox, and nine cases of German Measles. School returns are a useful index of the prevalence of non-notifiable diseases and are a basis for consultation with the school medical officer. Infestations.

In 1960 there were two deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis, the same as in 1959. The death rate remained at 0.025 per thousand of population. There was no death from non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis, compared with one in 1959, when the death rate was 0.01 per thousand of population. For England and Wales the death rate for Pulmonary Tuberculosis was 0.07 per thousand of population and for non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis 0.01 per thousand of population. The number of new cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis was nineteen, compared with forty one new cases in 1959. Residual foci of infection still persist, particularly among the middle aged and elderly, and intensive search will be necessary to eliminate the disease. The use of B.C.G. vaccine in adolescent children gives a high measure of protection. Six hundred and eighty two children received injections in 1960, and twenty five children were found to be Mantoux positive. The response rate in the thirteen year age group was 73.1 per cent. Six new cases of non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis were notified in 1960, compared with four in 1959. The Sutton and Cheam Tuberculosis and Chest Care Committee continued its valuable assistance to patients suffering from Tuberculosis and other chronic chest conditions and to their families throughout the year. Additional nourishment, clothing and bedding were provided where necessary. Grants were made to provide occupational therapy, and holidays were arranged for children, mothers, and convalescent patients. Miss N.L. Tayler, Care Almoner of Sutton Chest Clinic, who replaced Mr. F.J. Stevens, most competently advised the Committee on all necessitous cases. The Chairman is Mrs. F. Smyth, J.P., and the Hon. Secretary is County Alderman Mrs. Margaret Walkden, O.B.E., J.P., 9, All Saints Road, Sutton.

One thousand, five hundred and fifty five persons were examined. The results were as follows:- Male Female Total Number of persons examined 635 920 1555 Pulmonary Tuberculosis: Cases requiring treatment or close clinic supervision 2 1 3 Primary lung cancer - - The incidence of active Pulmonary Tuberculosis was 1.9 per thousand persons examined. The findings are an index of infection in a sample of the population. They show the value of Mass Radiography in securing diagnosis and treatment. 50 APPENDIX ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN RESPECT OF THE YEAR I960 FOR THE BOROUGH OF SUTTON AND CHEAM IN THE COUNTY OF SURREY PRESCRIBED PARTICULARS ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE FACTORIES ACT, 1937 PART 1 OF THE ACT 1.
