Sanitary Department, Vestry Hall, Kensington. June, 1866. Gentlemen, It again becomes my duty to present you with a brief annual record of the mortality which has taken place in your Parish during the past year, with the number of Births; also the amount of Nuisances, the number of Cow Sheds and Slaughter Houses licensed by your Board, and with a short account of the general Sanitary condition of the Districts. The first fact to which I beg to call your attention is, that, during the last year, the total amount of Deaths has amounted to 1,733. This death rate, I am happy to inform you, is, with our rapidly increasing population, less by 116 than in the past year. males. females. total.

This ratio of mortality must be considered highly satisfactory when we take into consideration the increased number of inhabitants. It is worthy of note that, during this time, 130 deaths have occurred in the Hospital for Consumption, all of whom (with the exception of 7) were non-parishioners. 17 The Births during the year have been— males. females. total.
