PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, Town Hall, Hackney, N.E. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney. Gentlemen, I beg to present herewith my Seventeenth Annual Report on the Public Health of the Borough of Hackney. From a public health point of view the year 1908 must be regarded as specially satisfactory, even more so than the year 1907, which was a year favourable to low mortality statistics. The former year, now under review, was characterised by a low general death rate, 13.9 per 1,000 of the population. This is the lowest corrected annual death rate for Hackney experienced for many years. The infant mortality was 116 per 1,000 births, exactly the same as last year, which was a record year in respect of low infant mortality. Infectious disease was also much less prevalent, and the zymotic death rate considerably lower than during 1907. These figures must be considered together with the facts that the population of the Borough of Hackney has a density of 71.0 persons per acre, which 6 density has been increasing year by year, and that the Borough is changing more and more from a suburban residential district to an urban industrial centre. Increasing density of population, and the change from suburban residential to urban industrial conditions are usually marked by an unfavourable change in mortality statistics. This has not been the case in connection with Hackney. In spite of increasing density and the gradual change to urban conditions the annual mortality from all causes and the infant mortality have progressively declined. The following table will illustrate this favourable change and the increasing healthiness of the Borough, in spite of adverse circumstances. Table showing Density of Population, Annual Mortality from all causes and Infant Mortality in the Borough of Hackney, during the 10 years ending 1908. Year. Density. General Death Rate (per 1,000 living). Infantile Mortality Rate (per 1,000 births). 1899 67.5 17.9 165 1900 66.5 17.4 162 1901 66.7 16.6 137 1902 67.3 16.0 121 1903 67.9 14.7 127 1904 68.5 16.0 155 1905 69.1 15.0 140 1906 69.8 14.1 123 1907 70.6 14.4 116 1908 71.0 13.9 117 In reference to the subject of Infant Mortality I may incidentally mention the institution in the Borough during the past year by the Mayor, Alderman Billings, of an agency for training Voluntary Health Visitors, for the purpose of visiting and giving to parents needing it elementary instruction in the care and feeding of infants. I look forward with some confidence to this agency doing much good in the Borough. I am pleased to state that the officers of the Public Health Department have, on the whole, carried out the duties entrusted to them to my entire satisfaction. 7 Population and Density.— On the basis of the increase of population of the Borough of Hackney, which took place during the period 1891 to 1901, I estimate the population of Hackney at the end of June, 1908, to be 233,528 persons. On this estimate the density of population becomes 71.0 persons per acre for the whole Borough, varying from 50.5 per acre in the North Sub-District to 104.7 in the South-West Sub-District. The following table gives the population and density of the Sub-Districts, compared with the whole of London:— Table Showing estimated Population, Area and Density of the Registration Sub-Districts in Hackney, at middle of 1908. North. Central. SouthWest. SouthEast. Total for Hackney Total for London. Estimated Population 54,674 55,909 61,243 61,702 233,528 4,795,757 Area in square acres 1,082 856 585 764 3,287 74,839 Density—persons per acre 50.5 65.3 104.7 80.7 71.0 64.0 Marriages and Marriage Rates.— During the year 1908 there were 1,996 marriages solemnized in the Borough of Hackney. The annual marriage rate for persons married during this period is 17 per 1,000 of the estimated population, and that for all London for the same period is 15.9 per 1,000 of the population. The following table gives the number of marriages and the marriage rates for the Borough of Hackney and London for the ten years 1898-1907:- 8 Year. Borough of Hackney. London. Marriages. Marriage Rate.

The figures show a diminution of 88 in the number of births compared with that registered during the year 1907. The annual birth rate for Hackney for the year 1908 is therefore 24.3 per 1,000 of the population. The table below gives the number of births registered in the different sub-districts with their respective birth rates compared with that of London. The birth rate for London for the same period is 25.2 per 1,000 living. Illegitimate Births and Birth Rates. — There were 403 illegitimate births registered in the Borough of Hackney during the year 1908, but of these 259 occurred in the Salvation Army Rescue Home, Mare Street, 253 being of mothers from places outside of Hackney, also 17 illegitimate births occurred in the Hackney Union Infirmary—the mothers belonging to other districts. Deducting these 270 from the total registered there remain 133 illegitimate 9 births amongst the population of Hackney during 1908. This is equal to an illegitimate birth rate of 23.4 per 1,000 births. Below is given the rates for the respective sub-districts of the Borough. Table. Births. Registration District of Hackney.

On the other hand, 430 residents of Hackney died in institutions outside the Borough. Making the necessary corrections, the number of deaths amongst Hackney residents during the year was 3,126. This shows a decline of 108 deaths upon the number for the preceding year. The general death rate from all causes for the year 1908 is therefore 13.3 per 1,000 of the estimated population. On making further correction for age and sex distribution by means of the factor 1.04262, I obtain for the Borough the corrected general death-rate of 13.9 per 1,000 of the population. The corrected general mortality rate for the year 1907 was 14.49 per 1,000 living, so the rate for last year shows a satisfactory improvement upon the rate for the preceding year. Amongst the sub-districts I find as usual the lowest death-rate in the North (11.0 per 1,000) and the highest (15.0 per 1,000) in the South-East district. The corrected annual death-rate from all causes for London during 1908 is 14 5 per 1,000 living. Sub-District. , Population. No. of Births. Birthrate. Total Deaths. Deathrate. Deaths under 1 year.

This is a decline of one on the number registered during 1907. The infant mortality rate, therefore, for the last year is 117 per 1,000 births, practically the same as that during the year 1907. Diarrhœal diseases caused 141 deaths; wasting diseases, including premature births, were responsible for 203 deaths; tuberculosis diseases, 33 deaths; overlying, 26 deaths; lung diseases, 101 deaths; and the common infectious diseases, 34 deaths. It is obvious that a large number of these are preventable. The infant mortality for all London for the year 1908 is 113 per 1,000 births.

That this Conference expresses its appreciation of Parliament having passed the Notification of Births Act, 1907, and urges upon all Local Authorities the importance of adopting the Act, and appointing qualified women to carry out its provisions. 2. That in order to combat the prevalent ignorance, resulting in wastage of infant life and injury to the health of many survivors, the Conference urges upon the Board of Education and upon Education Authorities generally, the importance of securing to all girls, in every grade of school, a satisfactory training in domestic and personal hygiene, and in the duties of womanhood. 3. That this Conferences welcomes most gladly the Children's Bill, introduced into the House of Commons by Mr. Herbert Samuel, M.P., for the amendment of the Infant Life Protection Act, 1897, and recommends the Executive Committee to ask that it be specially amended to include the cases in which one child is put out to nurse for reward. 4. That the Conference, being convinced of the injury done to infant life and health through infants being taken into publichouses, urges upon Parliament the necessity of providing such legislation as will prevent this. 5. That the Children's Bill be amended to empower Local Authorities to charge upon the rates the cost of carrying out the existing statutory provisions for the prevention of cruelty to children. 6. That this Conference is of opinion that Boards of Guardians ought to make greater use of their existing powers to adopt children incorrigible parents. 15 7. That all preparations offered or sold as foods or drugs for infants should be certified by a Government analyst as noninjurious, and that each packet should contain its analysis; and that the provisions of the Fertilisers and Food Stuffs Act should be applied to drugs and foods sold purporting to be for the use of infants. 8. That the Conference shall confirm the resolution of the former Conference that the Midwives Act, 1902, be extended to Scotland and to Ireland. 9. That this Conference shall continue as a Committee to give effect to the foregoing resolutions, with power to remit to an Executive Committee to carry out the same. On the motion of the Mayor of Jarrow, it was resolved to refer to the Executive Committee to consider whether, at the next Conference, it would be desirable to table a resolution, asking the Government, when passing Adoptive Acts, to at the same time provide part of the means whereby they can be administered locally. It was further moved that, in view of the unsatisfactory conditions under which milk is produced and distributed, this Conference, being of opinion that immediate amendment of the law is desirable, urges upon Parliament the necessity of at once taking such steps as are necessary to effect this. The resolution was carried unanimously. Senile Mortality.—The deaths which occurred in the Borough at 65 years and upwards numbered 847, and of these 418 occurred between the ages of 65 and 75 years; 342 between the years of 75 and 85 years, and 87 were at the ages of 85 years and upwards. The annual mortality rate of persons of 65 years and upwards is 3 6 per 1,000 persons living. Deaths in Public Institution!.—There were 1,307 deaths in public institutions in the Borough during 1908 ; of these 499 were residents of other districts, and the remaining 808 were residents Hackney. 16 The following lists give the institutions within the Borough, receiving persons both from and without the Borough, and also the institutions outside the Borough receiving sick and infirm persons from the Borough, with the number of deaths in each institution during the year 1908.

During the year 1908 there were 2,055 cases of infectious disease compulsorily notified in the Borough; but of these, 75 were subsequently found not to be suffering from the disease notified, thus reducing the number of genuine cases of notifiable disease to 1,980 cases. The number shows a decline on the number notified in 1907. The attack rate for the year in respect of the compulsorily notifiable infectious diseases is, therefore, 8.4 per 1,000 persons living. In addition there were 102 cases of phthisis voluntarily notified. This is a decline of 55 on the number notified during the previous year. The deaths from the seven chief zymotic diseases numbered 346. This is equal to a zymotic death rate of 1.05 per thousand living persons in the Borough. A. NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Smallpox.—One case supposed to be smallpox was notified during 1908, but was subsequently found not to be suffering from this disease. Scarlet Fever.—The total number of cases of this disease notified during 1908 was 1,252, but of this number 38 were found subsequently not to be suffering from scarlet fever. The genuine cases of this disease is, therefore, reduced to the number of 1,214. This is a decrease of 483 on the number which occurred in the Borough during 1907. The attack rate of scarlet fever for the year 1908 is 5.2 per thousand living persons. The chart accompanying this report shows the incidence of this disease week by week throughout the year. It will be observed that it was at its lowest point during the months of April, May, June, July and August, but was much higher during the remaider of the year. The number of cases of scarlet fever removed to hospital during the year was 1,133. This is equivalent to more than 90 per cent. of the number of eases notified. The following table shows the dates of removal of these cases in relation to the date of notification:— 33 SCARLET FEVER—1907. Nursed at Home. Removed to Hospital. Removal to Hospital after Notification. Before Receipt of Notification. Same Day as Notification Received. 1 Day. 2 Days. 3 Days. 4 Days. 6 Day». Over 7 Days. 119 803 294 27 5 1 2 1 0 Total Cases Removed, 1133. The following table shows the distribution of the disease in the respective sub-districts of the Borough. Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Cases of Scarlet Fever. 283 337 306 326 Attack rate per 1,000. 5.0 60 5.0 5.2 This table shows that scarlet fever was rather more prevalent in the Central Sub-district than in the remaining sub-districts. The deaths from scarlet fever numbered 27. This is equivalent to a mortality rate of 22.2 per 1,000 attacked and 0.1l per 1,000 living persons. The mortality for London for the same disease during the same period is 0.11 per 1,000 living persons. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup.—There were 382 cases of diphtheria and membranous croup notified in the Borough during 1908, but of these, 31 cases were subsequently found not to be suffering from diphtheritic disease, thus reducing the genuine cases of this disease to 351. This is a decrease of 118 upon the number of genuine cases notified during 1907. The attack rate for the year 1908 is 1.5 per 1,000 living persons. As may be seen from the chart, the incidence of the disease was low during the whole year. The number of cases removed 34 to ho8pital was 324. This is equal to 84 per cent, of the total notified. The following table shows the distribution of diphtheritic disease in the various sub-districts of the Borough during 1907 :— Sub-Districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Cases of Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. 91 103 85 103 Total attack rate per 1000. 1.6 1.9 1.3 1.6 It will be noted from the above table that the largest number of cases notified occurred in the Central and South-West subdistricts. The deaths from diphtheria and membranous croup during the year numbered 44. This is equal to a mortality rate of 12.5 per cent. attacked, and .19 per 1,000 living persons. The death rate from diphtheritic disease for all London for the same period is 0.15 per 1,000 living. During the year 208 swabbings from throats of persons suspected to be suffering from diphtheria were bacteriologically examined, 74 of which gave positive and 127 negative results, and 7 were doubtful. Typhoid or Enteric Fever.—During the year 1908 there were 66 cases notified as typhoid or enteric fever; but of these 5 cases were found later on not to be suffering from this disease, thus reducing the genuine cases to 61. This 'is a fall of 35 on the number of genuine cases of enteric fever notified during 1907. The attack rate for the year 1908 is .26 per 1,000 living persons. The chart shows the disease to be present in the Borough practically the whole year. There was a slight rise during the 35 later months of the year. Of the 66 cases notified 56 were removed to hospital. This is equal to 89.2 per cent. of the total. The following table gives the distribution of the cases in the sub-districts of the Borough.

The deaths from enteric or typhoid fever numbered during the year 9. This is equal to an annual mortality of nearly 15 per cent. attacked, and 0 03 per 1.000 living persons. During the year 20 specimens of blood from persons suspected to be suffering from enteric or typhoid fever were examined; of these 4 gave " Widal's " reaction, and the remainder gave negative results. The mortality for all London for the same period is 0 05 per 1,000 living persons. Typhus.—No case of this disease was notified in the Borough during 1908. Continued Fever.—No case of continued fever was notified during 1908 in Hackney. Puerperal Fever.—There were 12 cases of puerperal fever notified during 1908, of which 9 were removed to hospital. The deaths from puerperal fever during 1908 numbered only 2. The attack rate was 2.3 per 1,000 births, and the mortality rate 0.4 per 1,000 births. c 2 36 Plague.—No case of plague occurred in the Borough during 1908. Erysipelas.—There were 233 cases of erysipelas notified in Hackney during 1908. This is equivalent to an attack rate of nearly 1.0 per 1,000 persons living. Of the 233 cases notified, 58 were removed to hospital, which is equal to nearly 24 per cent. of the total. There were 7 deaths during 1908 in the Borough ascribed to erysipelas. This is equal to a mortality rate of 3 per cent. attacked, and .03 per 1,000 living persons. Below is given the distribution of the disease in the several subdistricts of the Borough. Sub-districts.

In two of the cases the specific micro-organism, the diplococcus intracellularis was isolated. B. NON-NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Influenza.—This disease was the cause of 54 deaths in the Borough during 1908. This is an increase of 26 on the number occurring during 1907. The death rate from this disease is therefore .23 per 1,000 living persons, that for all London .27 per 1,000. Chicken-pox.—One death was attributed to chicken-pox during the year 1908. 37 Diarrhoea.—Diarrhoea was registered as the cause of 153 deaths during 1908, and of these 102 were amongst infants under 1 year of age. The total shows an increase of 66 upon the number during the previous year. In addition there were 51 deaths from enteritis. The death rate from diarrhoea is .65 per 1,000 living persons. The mortality rate for London for the same period is .53 per 1,000 living persons. The distribution of the deaths from diarrhoea is given below. Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East.

This is an increase of 13 on the number occurring during the previous year. The mortality rate of this disease for 1908 is .3 per 1,000 living, and that for all London .31 per 1,000 living. The following table gives the distribution of the deaths in the different sub-districts:— Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East.

In each of these cases a leaflet on the prevention of the spread of measles was despatched to the parent. Whooping Cough.—There were 42 deaths from whooping cough in Hackney during 1908. This is a decline of 23 upon the number which occurred during 1907. The mortality rate for 1908 from this disease is, therefore, 18 per 1,000 living persons. The death rate for all London for the same period is .20 per 1,000 living. The following shows the distribution of the deaths from whooping cough in the Borough :— Sub-districts. North. Central.

In each of these cases a leaflet on the prevention of the spread of whooping cough was despatched to the parent. CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. Tuberculosis.—During the year 1908 there were 102 cases of pulmonary phthisis voluntarily notified by medical practitioners practising in the Borough. This is a decline of 55 upon the number notified during 1907. Bateriological examination of sputa from 92 suspected cases was made during the same period. In 14 of these cases the examination revealed the presence of the bacillus of tuberculosis, and in the remaining cases the results were negative. 39 The deaths from tuberculosis in the Borough numbered during the past year 379, which are classified as follows :— Tuberculous Phthisis 225 Phthisis 37 General Tuberculosis 39 Tuberculous Meningitis 35 „ Peritonitis 19 Tabes Mesenterica 12 Tubercle of other Organs 12 379 The annual mortality rate for tuberculous disease for Hackney is 1.6 per 1,000 living.

ALCOHOLISM. During 1907 there were 9 deaths caused by acute alcoholic poisoning. In addition 26 deaths were ascribed to cirrhosis of the liver, a disease due in most cases to excessive indulgence in alcohol extending over considerable periods. VACCINATION. The following is a summary of the Supplementary Returns made by the Vaccination Officers respecting the vaccination of children whose births were registered in Hackney from the 1st January to 31st December, 1907, inclusive.

(a) Complaints of Nuisance.—During the year 1908 there were 2,003 complaints of nuisances made to the Public Health Department, and investigated by the Sanitary Inspectors of the Borough. A considerable number, about 13 per cent., were anonymous; but these received the same consideration as other complaints. Notices were served for the abatement of any nuisances found, on the person or persons liable under the above Act to abate the nuisances. (b) Infectious disease.—There was a less number of houses inspected after infectious disease during 1908 than during the previous year owing to less prevalence of notifiable infectious disease in the Borough. The number of houses so inspected was 1847. This is a decline of 657 upon the number so inspected during 1907. The nuisances found, were dealt with in the usual way under the provisions of the above Act. (c) House to House Inspections. — Inspections under this head are distinct from and in addition to those made under the headings (a) and (b). There were 1,554 house to house inspections made in the Borough during 1908. These inspections have been made as may be seen from the Register of Work given in another part of this Report in various parts of the Borough, but chiefly in Homerton, London Fields, Spring Hill and Hackney Wick, i.e., the poorer parts of the Borough. The nuisances found on inspection were abated in most cases on the service of an Intimation Notice alone. The total number of such notices served during the year was 4,365. It was necessary, in addition, to serve 429 Statutory Notices and to issue 16 Summonses to secure the abatement of certain nuisances. The result of these 16 prosecutions is given in the appendix to this report. The following details refer to the house to house inspections made by the Special Inspectors appointed for this work. 43 Details of house to house inspections made in the London Fields District during the year 1908 by Inspector W.

DAIRIES, COW-SHEDS AND MILKSHOPS. Cow-houses.—There are 21 licensed cow-keepers iu the Borough owning 32 cow-sheds. This number is the same as at the end of 1907. Inspector Bobbitt reports that he made 269 visits of 47 inspection to these premises during the year and served two notices to remedy some small defects and for the removal of an excessive accumulation of manure. The notices were immediately complied with. On the 6th September the Public Health Committee made an inspection of the cow-houses of the Borough. These were all found to be in a satisfactory condition, with the exception of one cow-house which was dirty and untidy. A notice was subsequently served upon the cow-keeper to remedy the nuisance found. Dairies and Milk Shops.—During 1908 there were 35 milk places removed from the register and 24 new milk places added. The total on the register at the end of 1908 was 362. The Inspector reports that he made 1,218 visits during the year to these premises. During these visits he discovered dirty utensils in 35 of the milk places; there were also discovered 7 premises, on the owners of which it was necessary to serve notices for repairs. The notices were immediately attended to. Offensive Trades.—At the end of 1908 there was only one premises in the Borough licensed to carry on an offensive trade, viz., a tripe boiler. The Inspector reports that he made 16 visits during the year to these premises. No breach of the regulation relating to offensive trades was discovered. The London County Council resolved during 1908 to add to the list of offensive trades that of fish-skin dressing. By-laws relating to this trade have been made by the Council and came into force on January 1st, 1909. In the appendix will be seen a copy of these By-laws. Slaughter-houses.—There were 25 slaughter houses in the Borough at the end of 1908. During the year one was struck off the list by the London County Council. The Inspector reports that he made 393 visits of inspection to the slaughter-houses of the Borough during 1908. As a result he had only to serve three notices for slight repairs. On the 6th September the Public Health Committee made their annual inspection of the slaughter-houses of the Borough. During this inspection the sheep pound of one 48 slaughter-house was found to be improperly used; and another slaughter-house was discovered to be dirty and untidy. With these exceptions all the slaughter houses were found to be in a very satisfactory condition. The following statement gives particulars as to the milk-places cowsheds, slaughter-houses, and offensive trades in the Borough Premises. Number op Places. Number of Inspections, 1908.

The Inspector reports that he made 76 visits to these places during the year, and found all the carcases and meat used on these occasions to be free from disease. Smoke Nuisances.—During 1908 the Smoke Inspector made 1,480 observations of chimneys of factories, workshops and other places in the Borough. These observations lasted from half-an-hour upwards. Intimation notices for the abatement of smoke nuisances were served to the number of 46, and Statutory notices to the number of two. One summons was issued for smoke nuisance, and an order on the defendant was made to abate the nuisance and to pay £1 3s. costs. Water Supply.—Section 48 (2) Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Under this Section 42 certificates of proper and sufficient supply of water were issued to owners of new or rebuilt dwelling houses in the Borough. The certificates refer to 97 houses and tenements. By -laws for Houses let in Lodgings. — During 1908 the whole of the occupied registered houses let in lodgings in the Borough were inspected. The number registered is 463, of which 226 are situate in Hackney Wick, and 237 in the London Fields Districts. The following tables show the number inspected and defects found and give other details respecting the registered houses let in lodgings in the Borough :— HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS—INSPECTION 1908.

During the year 1908 applications were made to me by five owners of tenement properties to inspect their property, with a view to giving certificates that the tenements were so constructed "as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or " persons dwelling therein, and that due provision is made for their "sanitary requirements," for the purpose of obtaining exemption from Inhabited House Duty. The five applications had reference to 37 tenements. These I inspected, and granted the required certificates, after the execution of certain necessary alterations. CANAL BOATS ACT, 1877-1894. The Canal Boats Inspector of the Borough reports that he made 83 visits to the waterways in the Borough during 1908, and inspected 50 canal boats. Amongst these he found three infringements of the Regulations, i.e., the marking on the boat required by Act was not legible, the boat required repainting and the Certificate of Registration was not on board.

The following is a summary of certain regulations made December 18th, 1908, under Section 130 of the Public Health Act, 1875, as amended by the Public Health Act, 1896, by the Local Government Board, for the prevention of the spread of Tuberculosis, including Pulmonary Tuberculosis. PUBLIC HEALTH (TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS, 1908. Article I. Is concerned with defining the various terms used in the Regulations. Article II. Determines that the Regulations shall come into operation on the 1st January, 1909, and shall have effect throughout England and Wales, and be enforced by every Council, Board of Guardians, Joint Committee and Board of Managers. Article III. Determines the Authorities to supply necessary notification forms as set forth in the Schedule to the Regulations and other details as to the mode of notifying. 56 Article IV. Provides that the Medical Officer of a Poor Law Institution shall, within 48 hours after his first recognition of the symptoms of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in a poor person, an inmate of the Poor Law Institution, notify particulars of the case as set out in the Schedule to the Medical Officer of Health of the area in which the poor person resided immediately before his admission to the Poor Law Institution. Article V. Provides that the District Medical Officers shall, within 48 hours of first recognition of the symptoms of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in a poor person, upon whom he is in medical attendance, notify certain particulars as set out in the Schedule to the Regulations to the Medical Officer of Health for the area in which the residence of the poor person is situate. Article VI. Provides that the Superintending Officer of a Poor Law Institution shall, within a period of 48 hours after the departure of a poor person from a Poor Law Institution in which he has been an inmate, and in relation to whose case the Medical Officer of such Institution has, in pursuance of Article IV, posted a notification to the Medical Officer of Health, as far as he is able, notify the actual or intended place of destination and address of the poor person, in accordance with Form C in the Schedule, to the Medical Officer of Health of the area in which the place is situate. Article VII. Provides that a Relieving Officer, within 48 hours after having obtained accurate information of change of address of a poor person residing in his relief district, in relation to whose case a District Medical Officer has, in pursuance of Article V. sent a notification to a Medical Officer of Health, shall notify in accordance with Form D in the schedule such change of address to the Medical Officer of Health for the area in which the changed residence of the poor person is situate. Article VIII. Gives instructions as to the filling in of particulars in the counterfoil attached to each notification form, and determines the remuneration to be paid to the several officers whose 57 duty it is to make the required notification and also the procedure to be adopted in connection with these payments. Article IX. Provides that no enactment shall be put in force in respect to any poor person in relation to whom a notification in pursuance of these Regulations has been posted to a Medical Officer of Health, which "renders the poor person, or a person in charge of the poor person, or any other person, liable to a penalty, or subjects the poor person to any restrictions, prohibition or disability affecting himself, or his employment, occupation, means of livelihood, or residence, on the ground of his suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis." Subject to the above, a Council may, on the advice of their Medical Officer of Health in relation to such poor persons notified as suffering from pulmonary tubercnlosis :— 1. Take measures under any enactment relating to Public Health which have reference to the destruction and disinfection of infected articles, or the cleansing or disinfecting of premises. 2. To take all proper and necessary measures for the safe disposal or destruction of infectious material in connection with cases of pulmonary tuberculosis; and for the prevention of the spread of infection from any such material. 3. Supply all reasonable assistance or articles, as the circumstances of the case require, which may remove or diminish the risk of infection arising from conditions affecting the use of any room when used by the poor person as a sleeping apartment. 4. Furnish on loan or otherwise, any appliance or utensil which will assist in preventing the spread of infection. A Council may also, on the advice of their Medical Officer of Health, provide, publish, or distribute suitable summaries of information and instruction respecting pulmonary tuberculosis, and the precautions to be taken against the spread of infection from that disease. 58 Article X. Provides that all expenses incurred by a Board of Guardians, a Joint Committee, or Board of Managers, in pursuance of these Regulations, shall be defrayed as part of their establishment expenses under the Acts relating to the relief of the poor. Article XI. Provides that any question or difference arising in relation to any subject, matter of, or anything done under these Regulations, shall be determined on application by the Local Government Board. Article XII. Provides for certain modifications in areas where Local Acts containing provisions with respect to pulmonary tuberculosis are in force. Article XIII. Gives the title to the Regulations, viz.: "The Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908." CHILDREN'S ACT, 1908. Part I deals with Infant Life Protection, and provides that a person who undertakes for reward the nursing and maintenance of one or more infants under seven years of age shall, within fortyeight hours, notify in writing the fact to the Local Authority and shall again notify on change of residence. Such person shall also notify, within the same period, to the Local Authority, its removal from the care of such person. On the death of any such infant notice must also be given within twenty-four hours to the Coroner. A person having charge of any infant must have no interest in the life of the child for the purposes of the Life Assurance Act, 1774, and it will be an offence under the Act for such person directly or indirectly to attempt to insure the life of such infants. Every local authority must make inquiries within its district of persons who undertake the nursing and maintenance of infants and appoint Infant Protection Visitors to visit the infants so nursed and maintained. Local Authorities may combine for the purpose of executing the provision of the first part of this Act and for defraying the expenses thereof. The Local Authority may exempt from visitation any premises which appear to them to be properly 59 conducted, and may fix the number of infants under the age of seven years which may be kept in any dwelling; they may cause the removal of any infant from premises which are overcrowded, dangerous, or insanitary, or from the custody of any negligent, ignorant, drunken or criminal person. Every person guilty of an offence under this part of the Act is liable to imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding £25. The provisions of this part of the Act shall not extend to any relative or legal guardian of an infant undertaking its nursing and maintenance. Part II deals with the prevention of cruelty to children and young persons. Any person over the age of 16 years who has the care of a child or young person and wilfully illtreats, neglects, abandons such child or young person so as to be likely to cause injury to health, shall be liable to imprisonment with or without hard labour or to a fine. Where the death of an infant under the age of three years has been caused by suffocation whilst in bed with a person under the influence of drink such person shall be deemed to have neglected the infant and be liable to imprisonment or to a fine. It is an offence under the Act for a person having the care or custody of a child or young person, to cause or allow such child or young person to beg in any street or place ; or to allow a child to be in any room containing an open fire grate not protected against burning or scalding the child, or to allow children or young persons to be in brothels, or causing or encouraging or favouring the seduction of a girl under 16 years of age. Any child or young person in respect of whom an offence has been committed under this part of the Act may be taken by an authorised person to a place of safety, and may by an Order of a Court be removed from the custody of a person convicted of an offence, and may make an order on the parent or other person liable to contribute to its maintenance during a certain period. Part III is concerned with Juvenile Smoking, and imposes a penalty for selling cigarettes to children and young persons. It 60 gives power to a constable or park-keeper, to seize cigarettes or cigarette papers in the possession of any person, apparently under the age of sixteen years, who may be found smoking in any street or public place and also to search any boy found so smoking. Measures may also be taken to prevent cigarettes being obtained from automatic machines where such machines are used by children or young persons. Part IV is concerned with Reformatory and Industrial Schools, with their certification, inspection and management, and specifies the children who are liable to be sent to such schools ; it also gives power to subsequently apprentice or dispose of such children; provides for the expenses of certified schools; and for the establishment of Industrial Day Schools, &c. Part V is concerned with Juvenile Offenders; the methods of dealing with children and young persons charged with offences. It provides that a child or young person shall be kept apart from adults during detention at a police station ; and imposes certain restrictions as to their punishment; also provides for places of detention for children and young persons and for their custody therein, and the maintenance of such places of detention. Part VI consists of miscellaneous and general sections. It provides a penalty on vagrants preventing children receiving education, and on persons giving intoxicating liquor to children under the age of five years, except in sickness or other urgent cause. A publican renders himself liable to a fine if he allows a child to be in the bar of licensed premises, except during the hours of closing. This part also provides for the safety of children at entertainments and for the cleansing of verminous children. The expression "child" is defined as "a person under the age of fourteen years," "young person" as "a person who is fourteen years of age and upwards and under the age of sixteen years." The Local Authority for the whole of the Metropolis is the London County Council. 61 GLANDERS AND FARCY ORDER OF 1907. This new Order came into operation on the 1st January, 1909. It provides amongst other things that the Inspector of the Local Authority (in London the County Council) shall give notice of all cases of glanders and farcy to the Medical Officer of Health of the sanitary district in which the animal died or was slaughtered, or in which the carcase was at the time of the inspection. The clause requiring such notice by the Inspector runs as follows:— 3. (1) Every person having or having had in his possession or under his charge any diseased or suspected horse, aes, or mule shall, with all practicable speed, give notice of the fact of the horse, ass, or mule, being or having been so diseased or suspected to a constable of the police force for the police area wherein the diseased or suspected horse, ass, or mule is or was. (2) Every person licensed to slaughter horses who has in his possession a carcase of any diseased or suspected horse, ass, or mule shall, with all practicable speed, give notice of that fact to a constable of the police force for the police area wherein the carcase is. (3) The constable receiving the notice shall forthwith give information of the receipt by him of the notice to an Inspector of the Local Authority, who shall forthwith report the same to the Local Authority and also to the Medical Officer of Health of the Sanitary District in which the animal died or was slaughtered or hi which the carcase was at the time of the notice. (4) Where the notice of the disease relates to a carcase of an animal that has died or been slaughtered in the district of a Local Authority, other than the Local Authority which receives the notice, the latter shall forthwith inform the other Local Authority of the receipt of the notice. 62 The object of the Order is not only to prevent the spread of this disease amongst animals, but also to prevent infection of human beings. On the reception of the notice of a case of the disease in the Borough, I instruct one of the Inspectors to visit the premises where the case has occurred, and to report to me what disinfection has been taken and also the measures which have been adopted to prevent the spread of infection. During the year there were 17 cases of glanders notified. Upon inspection of the premises in which the cases had occurred, enquiries were also made as to the health of the stablemen and others; but on no occasion did it appear that human infection had arisen from any of the cases notified.

Number of Rooms Fumigated and Cleansed each Month during 1908. Month. Rooms Fumigated. Rooms Cleansed. Remarks. January 259 142 The method of fumigation is by burning sulphur. After fumigation the rooms to be cleansed are stripped of their wall-paper and cleansed with a solution of carbolic acid. The ceilings are afterwards whitened.

This disinfection is accomplished by means of high pressure saturated steam. The number of articles thus dealt with was 5,032 less than during the previous year. In addition to these there were 90 articles destroyed on request from the owners. These are set out in the following table:— Articles Destroyed. Beds 16 Quilt 1 Bolsters 6 Mattresses 16 Pillows 18 Palliasses 11 Blankets 2 Sundry Articles 5 Carpet 1 Overlay 1 Cushions 10 Sheets 3 Total 90 (c) Public Library Books.—In the month of May, 1908, the first Public Library was opened in the Borough. Amongst the Rules and Regulations to be observed by borrowers occurs the following:— 26. "No person shall take out of the Library any book for use in a house in which there is a person suffering from infectious disease." " Should a case of infectious disease occur in a house, any inmate of which has borrowed a book from the Public Library, notice must at once be given by the borrower to the Medical Officer of Health at the Town Hall, who will send for the book for the purpose of disinfection or destruction as he may consider best for the prevention of the spread of infection." In order to give effect to that part of this rule which refers to the disinfection of books, it was necessary to make special arrangements at our Disinfecting Station for the systematic disinfection of books. These articles are best disinfected by means of the gas formic aldehyde, which may be produced by the vaporisation of tablets of formalin in specially designed lamps. This is the method I have adopted for the disinfection of the public library books. It has the double merit of being economical and effectual. Since the opening of the library to the end of December, 1908, the officers of the Public Health Department have collected, disinfected, and returned to the Chief Librarian, 84 books. 74 Articles Disinfected During the Year 1908.

During the year 1908 there were 87 persons admitted to the Shelter while their homes were being disinfected. This total consisted of 21 men, 27 women, and 39 children, showing a decrease of 101 persons compared with the number admitted during the year 1907. The cost for maintenance of the above during last year was £10 5s. 9d. The average period of stay in the shelter was 21 days. The table on page 80 gives further particulars concerning these contacts. The expenses incurred in the conveyance of persons to and from the shelter during 1908 amounted only to 7s. 6d. CLEANSING OF PERSONS ACT, 1897. It is a gratifying fact that the facilities afforded by the Borough under the above Act for the cleansing of persons have been taken advantage of during the past year to a greater extent than in previous years. The number of baths given to persons affected with vermin since the baths were instituted are given below— Year 1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 1907 1908 No. at Baths 3 11 9 241 330 457 724 During the year 1908 the total number of baths given reached the number of 724, of these 165 were hot sulphur baths, and 559 ordinary hot water baths. Amongst those cleansed was a large number of children who had been excluded from school attendance owing to their being infected with vermin. Below is given a list of the schools in the Borough attended by these children, with the number and character of the baths given. 82 It is satisfactory to learn from enquiries I have made that a marked improvement has been observed in the cleanliness of the children attending the elementary schools of the Borough during the latter part of 1908, which is largely to be attributed to the facilities for cleansing offered by the Borough Council at their Disinfecting Station.

During 1908 there were collected by the Contractors from houses in the Borough 38,569 tons, 5 cwt., 3 qrs., and 2 lbs. of house refuse and removed to the Destructor at a total cost of £8,447 2s. 6d. From the North Division of the Borough 18,041 tons, 4 cwts., 1 qr., 14 lbs., were removed at the rate of 4s. per ton during the months of January, February and March, and at the rate of 4s. 6d. per ton during the remaining months of the year—the total cost for the North Division for the whole year being £3,930 13s. 3d. From the South Division 20,528 tons, 1 cwt., 1 qr., 16 lbs, were removed at the rate of 4s. 4d. per ton during the months of January, February and March, and at the rate of 4s. 6d. during the remaining months of the year—the total cost for the South Division for the whole year being £4,516 9s. 3d. The total amount of refuse removed during the whole year from the whole Borough shows an increase of nearly 183 tons and a tota increase in cost of £418 9s. 9d. This increased cost is not due solely to the increased tonnage, but was mostly due to the increased price charged per ton by the Contractors under the new Contracts which came into force on April 1st, 1908. The increased prices are given above. The cost of disposal of the house refuse removed to the destructor during 1908, which includes the destruction of the refuse by fire and the disposal of clinker arising from the refuse, together with the disposal of tins and other non-combustible material has been estimated by the Borough Electrical Engineer at the rate of 86 2s. 11½d. per ton for the first three months of the year, and at the rate of 3s. 3¾d. per ton for the remaining months of the year, and the total cost for the disposal alone of the house refuse for the Borough for the year at £6,187 12s. 7d. Adding this to the cost of removal, we get a total of £14,634 15s. 1d. for removal and disposal of the house refuse during 1908. Compared with the year 1907 this shows an increased cost of £208 7s. 4d. upon the total cost for the latter year. Distributing the total cost of the year over the estimated population of the Borough, it amounts to nearly 1s. 3½d. per head. I give below the usual table, showing the number of "refusals" and "no answers" given to the dustmen at their weekly calls. DUST REFUSALS AND NO ANSWERS FOR THE YEAR 1908. Week ending Refusals.

INFANT MORTALITY AND THE NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS ACT. Gentlemen, In considering the question of the adoption of the Notification of Births Act certain facts should be remembered, viz.:— 1. That the infant mortality is high in the Borough of Hackney. 2. That the measures hitherto taken to preserve the public health have not had any appreciable influence in lessening the infant mortality. 3. The main cause of the prevailing high infant mortality is improper feeding and care during the early months of life, which must be attributed largely to ignorance and carelessness on the part of those having the care of infants. 4. The local authority as the Public Health Authority of the Borough has a duty cast upon it to do everything in its power to lessen this mortality. The Notification of Births Act was passed with the object of giving local authorities an opportunity of obtaining information of births within thirty-six hours of their occurrence. It is recognised that such knowledge is requisite if anything material is to be done to prevent infant deaths in the early months. At present I receive weekly copies of the registrations of births from the Registrars of births in the Borough; but many of these births are not registered until some weeks after the births have actually occurred. G 2 100 During the month of September in this year I received from the Registrars notice of 446 births. The following table shows the time which has elapsed between the birth and the receipt of information of such births. AGE OF INFANTS WHEN BIRTHS WERE FIRST NOTIFIED TO LOCAL AUTHORITY, SEPTEMBER, 1908. Districts. 1 to 2 weeks. 2 to 3 weeks. 3 to 4 weeks. 4 to 5 weeks. 5 to 6 weeks. Over 6 weeks. Total. North 3 7 5 15 30 23 83 Central — — 4 9 28 46 87 South-West 5 9 11 15 44 65 149 South-East 2 8 8 9 31 69 127 10 24 28 48 133 203 446 Of this total 384 or 86 per cent. were not registered until more than one month after birth, and 203 or 45 per cent. until more than six weeks after birth. In connection with the above facts, it must be remembered that the largest number of infants die during the early months of life, especially during the first month. This fact is borne out by the following figures relating to infant mortality during the year 1908:— DEATHS OF INFANTS UNDER ONE YEAR DURING 1907. Ages. Under 1 month. 1 to 2 months. 2 to 3 months. 3 to 4 months. 4 to 5 months. 5 to 6 months. 6 to 7 months. 7 to 8 months. 8 to 9 months. 9 to 10 months. 10 to 11 months. 11 to 12 months. Total. No. of deaths 248 91 61 48 33 23 27 31 32 24 25 24 667 Out of a total of 667 deaths under one year 248 or 37 per cent. occurred under the age of one month, 339 or 50 per cent. under the age of two months, and 328 or 50 per cent. between the ages of two months and twelve months. 101 It is obvious from these facts that the early weeks of infant life are the most dangerous, therefore the earlier preventive measures are taken in the interest of the infant the more likely they are to be successful, and the greater the results to be anticipated. The further question to be considered is the use to which such information as the notification of births may be applied. This can most briefly be explained by the following quotation from a circular letter of the Local Government Board on the subject of the Notification of Births Act, 1907:— " The object of this Act, which will only be in operation where it has been adopted by the Local Authority with the consent of the Board, is to provide a speedy means whereby the information of the birth of a child may be given to the Medical Officer of Health of the Local Authority so that, if necessary, advice may be given to the mother in regard to the rearing and nurture of the child." The Act provides that notice shall be given to the Medical Officer of Health within 36 hours of birth. The Board further state that "in their opinion there is no occasion for imposing upon parents and others the obligation of notifying births unless steps are taken to carry out the ultimate object of the measure, viz., the giving of advice and instruction to those who have charge of the infants, and in ordinary circumstances they would not be prepared to consent to the adoption of the Act, unless it appeared that arrangements had been made for this purpose. These arrangements would usually be best carried out by local agencies under the Medical Officer o Health. The Board trust that the Council will consider the question of adopting the Act, and of co-operating with any agency that may exist, so as to secure its successful operation." It may be seen from the above quotation that the Local Government Board is not only anxious that the local authority should adopt the Act, but that co-operation with local agencies 102 would be regarded by the Board as satisfactory arrangements for giving advice and instruction to those who have charge of infants. This expression of opinion by the Local Government Board might alone be sufficiently convincing to induce some Local Authorities to adopt the Act; but apart from this, if a Local Authority, recognising its responsibilities to protect the health of all classes and ages, is interested in this question of infant mortality and is desirous of lessening it, if this result can be achieved by a reasonable expenditure consistent with the ends aimed at, then arguments are not wanting to show that the adoption of the Act, if properly supplemented, will lead ultimately to a diminution of infant mortality. Infant mortality being largely due to carelessness and want of knowledge, it follows that if measures are adopted to bring the necessary knowledge to those having the care and nurture of infants, there must be in course of time an improvement in the infant death rate. The dissemination of knowledge is the means employed everywhere to remove evils due to ignorance, and such means has met with signal success in every sphere of activity. Why should such efforts in this special field meet with less success? Prejudice, obstinacy, and unwillingness to receive instruction have ever been urged against any improvement, but these have always yielded when the proposed change has been based upon science and reason. No public health measure has ever been proposed based upon surer and more reasonable grounds than the proposal to bring to those needing it a knowledge of the proper principles of the care and nurture of infants. The cost as estimated by me is trifling, considering the end worked for. It is difficult to express in current coin of the realm the commercial value of a human life; but the late Dr. Fanestimated that the child of an agricultural labourer at birth is worth £5 to the community; at the age of 5 years, £56; at the age of 10 years, £117; at the age of 15 years, £192: at the age of 25 years, £246, then gradually decreasing in value to the age of 70 years, when its worth is represented by £1. 103 While attempts to represent the value of human life in terms of money must be more or less unsatisfactory, it must be admitted that the loss of infant life, now taking place in all parts of the country, is a loss in strength and value to the nation at large, and any attempt to diminish that loss, which promises a fair amount of success, ought to commend itself to a local authority. To adopt the Notification of Births Act would be the first step in such an attempt. The further steps to be taken after the adoption of the Act would be to organise, under proper supervision, a body of women workers, competent to advise nursing mothers as to the proper rearing and nurture of their infants. My experience in connection with the Hackney Infant Life Protection Society, organised by the Mayor, Alderman Billings, convinces me that a sufficient number of competent workers, for the purpose in view, may be found in connection with this Association. These only require to be set to work under supervision, but it would be impossible for me to personally supervise the work of more than one or two without some assistance. I am of opinion that if the Council appoint one woman Health Visitor, who has had an experience as midwife or nurse in a children's hospital, with some knowledge of sanitation, to assist me in this supervision, a creditable attempt might be made, with the help of the voluntary workers above referred to, to cope with the discreditably high infant mortality of the Borough. The annual cost of carrying out such a scheme would be trifling. It would mean the salary of one Health Visitor, and some incidental expenses for printing, &c. A competent woman for Health Visitor could be secured for a salary of £100 per annum, half of which would be refunded by the London County Council, and the incidental expenses would, I believe, not amount to more than £25 per annum.

To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. INTERCHANGE OF SANITARY INSPECTORS' DISTRICTS. Gentlemen, Reference.—"That each Sanitary Inspector appointed by the Council to a sanitary district shall be annually transferred to another sanitary district." I have carefully considered the above reference and beg herewith to report thereon. In the year 1901 the Public Health Committee had this question under their consideration, and enquiries were made of a large number of sanitary authorities as to whether they had adopted the system of interchange of sanitary districts, and with what results. In only a few cases had the experiment been made, but the general opinion was that the adoption of such a system would be prejudicial to public health administration. The Committee, therefore, took no further action in the matter. Considering the question again after the lapse of seven years, I am still at a loss to know any definite reason why the change should be made. I understand that the supporters of the change sum up their reasons in the general statement " that the Inspectors when settled in a district are liable to get too familiar with builders and owners of property in their respective districts." The above statement when examined appears to admit of two inferences, either the Inspectors do their work unsatisfactorily as permanent district Inspectors, or they are guilty in their relations with builders and owners of property of conduct unworthy of the confidence reposed in them. But in support of these inferences no evidence of misconduct or of negligence in the performance of their duties is forthcoming. On the other hand, apart from the behaviour of the Inspectors in relation to their duties and to builders and owners of property, 105 if it could be shown that the proposed change would lead to a better and more complete sanitary supervision of the Borough, it would be a strong argument in its favour; yet not only has this not been shown, but, on the contrary, a great deal of evidence could be advanced to show that the proposals would be highly prejudicial to the sanitary supervision of the Borough. (1). I believe that the periodical exchange of the Inspectors to other districts would lead to a great confusion in keeping the records of sanitary wcrk. At present the details of Sanitary Inspection, &c., of each district are recorded in the books kept by each district Inspector. It is comparatively easy to ascertain at present the sanitary works done at any particular house, and the officer supervising them, especially if the search is supplemented by the officer's local knowledge; on the other hand, if the Inspectors change their districts, either new diaries will have to be taken by the Inspectors at the change, or we will have the sanitary details of two or more districts recorded in the same Inspector's books. This, in the course of a few years, would render it increasingly difficult to find the records relating to sanitary work done in connection with any particular premises. (2). If the change is arranged to take place at the beginning of the year, we should have the difficulty of Inspectors making inspections and serving notices for sanitary works during the last few weeks of any year for other Inspectors at a later date to supervise; or if as an alternative each Inspector has to supervise the execution of work required on any notice served by him, we should have the unusual and confusing spectacle of every one of the Inspectors working in two districts. It is hardly necessary to add that such a condition of things would be extremely wasteful of the time and energies of the Inspectors. (3) There is another result which I am afraid would follow from the interchange of sanitary districts, and that is, a prejudicial effect upon the Inspectors themselves. The permanent appointment of the Inspectors has hitherto appeared to inspire them with a spirit of enthusiasm and healthy competition to acquaint themselves 106 with the prevailing nuisances and conditions prejudicial to health and an interest in the sanitary improvement of their respective districts. Such a spirit in officers is absolutely necessary to secure the best results of their appointment. The interchange of districts would, in my opinion, abolish this spirit, as the Inspectors would know that their appointment to any district would only be for a short time, and they would probably not see the results of their work, they would naturally lose interest in their district. (4) The interchange would add to my own difficulties in supervising the work of the Inspectors. Where they are regularly interchanged it is obvious I should have more difficulty, after a time, in tracing the officer who supervised any particular work, or of obtaining from him details of work, executed at some previous time. (5) It is clear that positive advantages do arise from the permanent appointment of officials to districts or portions of districts, for under such a system the Inspectors acquire a thorough knowledge of house property and its condition in their districts, which is invaluable to the Public Health administration of the district. By interchanging the Inspectors these advantages would be more or less lost. If we consider some other appointments of municipal officers, we see they are appointed for an indefinite time to districts, or portions of districts, and are usually only changed when there is a vacancy. I refer to the offices of Rate Collector, Relieving Officer, District Surveyor, etc, and the same may be said of Factory Inspectors, and some other Government Officers. That such a system is general shows clearly enough that satisfactory results are obtained from it; otherwise we should expect it would long ago have been exchanged for some other system yielding better results, either administrative or economic. Rate Collectors and District Surveyors must become acquainted in the course of their work with builders and owners of property, 107 but I have never heard this fact advanced as a reason why they should be changed into itinerant officers. (6) Another point must be considered, and that is the probable attitude of the Local Government Board to the proposed change. It is well known that half the salary of the Inspectors is paid by the Local Government Board through the London County Council, on the condition that their appointment and the conditions of appointment, etc., are subject to the Board's approval. The appointment of Inspectors to districts, or parts of districts, is favoured and approved of by the Board. It is assumed that the Officer will not be removed from his district except for some weighty reason. I do not think the Board, when consenting to an appointment, contemplate the periodical exchange of districts, nor do I think the Board would consent to such an arrangement unless very strong and conclusive reasons were advanced in favour of it. At any rate, if the Committee resolve to make the experiment, I am of opinion that it will be necessary to take the Local Government Board into their confidence before making the change. In conclusion, I am of opinion, for the reasons above advanced, that the proposed interchange of Sanitary Inspectors would lead to confusion and difficulty in the sanitary administration of the Borough, and to that extent would be prejudicial to the interests of public health. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. KING WARRY, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. 108 PROPOSED BATHING POOL—HACKNEY MARSHES. Report of the Medical Officer of Health on the condition of the water of the River Lee Navigation Stream and its suitability for bathing purposes. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Hackney N.E., 2nd January, 1908. To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, The proposal to construct a bathing pool adjacent to the River Lee, to be supplied with untreated water from that source is not new. It may be remembered that on the 4th March, 1896, I received a letter from Mr. Sexby, the Chief Officer to the Parks Department of the London County Council, stating inter alia that the Council had enlarged a part of the River Lee and constructed two dams at this point, forming a pool, the river water being excluded, and the pool being filled by percolating subsoil water only. The letter went on to state, "As bathing will shortly commence I write to inform you what the Council propose to do at this place. It is suggested to make a convenient bridge across the island to the bathing pool, and to erect a rough and inexpensive shelter where bathers can undress, &c. "I understand, however, you raised some point as to the water supply and as to the propriety of bathing at all in Lee water. 1 think it right to acquaint you with the fact that the Council do not propose to lay on a pure water supply, but that the pool has been enlarged on the assumption that the bathing which has been allowed for so many years would still be permitted. Of course, the conditions would be considerably improved, not merely as regards provision against danger from drowning, but also as regards the purity of the water. The only times when Lee water will be 109 admitted are in flood time, and, if necessary, occasionally at high tides, should it become desirable to introduce fresh water into the pool, but as a rule the percolation of sub-soil water will be sufficient to keep the pool well supplied and in comparatively pure condition." "I submit these facts to you before advising the Council to proceed with the construction of the proposed shelter, as I wish it to be made quite clear that your Vestry would not offer, on sanitary grounds, any objection to the continuance of the bathing. Should it think proper to do so, I probably should advise the Council to remove the dams and to take no steps whatever with regard to bathing in the river, leaving matters as they are now.'' This letter was considered by the Sanitary Committee of that time who made a visit to the site of the bathing pool, and finally instructed me to communicate with the Parks Committee in the terms of the following letter:— Town Hall, Hackney, N.E., 13th May, 1896. HACKNEY MARSH. Dear Sir, I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 22nd ultimo, upon the subject of the bathing place in the River Lee adjoining the Council's land, which was laid before the Sanitary Committee at their meeting, held on Thursday last, and in reply, I am requested to inform you that the Committee have inspected the bathing pool and had a sample of the water analysed, and from the analysis, copy of which is enclosed, it appears that the water is highly polluted; and having fully considered these facts, together with the statement in your first communication, that " the only times when Lee water will be admitted are in flood times, and, if necessary, occasionally at high tides," they are of opinion it would be dangerous for bathing to take place in such water and are not prepared to give their approval to the scheme. 110 Provided, however, that if your Committee were to devise some method of keeping the Lee water out of the pool, except such as has been purified by sub-soil percolation, or lay on a pure supply, the Sanitary Committee would withdraw all opposition to the use of the pool for bathing purposes. I am, Dear Sir, Yours faithfully, (Signed) J. KING WARRY, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. The Chief Officer, Parks Department, London County Council. On receipt of this letter the London County Council abandoned their proposal to give an official sanction and encouragement to bathing in the impure waters of the River Lee. Such is the account of the earlier attempt to establish a bathing pool on the Hackney Marsh to be supplied with its impure waters. The present proposal owes its origin, I am informed, to the desire to provide work for the unemployed during the winter months. The proposal seems to have been first made in the month of October, 1906, in the following resolution passed by the Distress Committee, viz.:— "That, with a view to providing work for the unemployed, this Committee suggests that an open-air bathing place be constructed near the River Lee, and that the Borough Council be asked to approach the Central (Unemployed) Body for London on the subject." This resolution has been under consideration up till October, 1907, when a reference was received by the Public Health Committee from the Works and General Purposes Committee, asking if the water in the Lee Navigation Stream surrounding the Hackney Marshes, or at Horse Shoe Point, was in a fit condition for bathing purposes. Before coming to any decision on the subject, I was instructed to visit the places mentioned and report as to whether the water 1ll was in my opinion suitable for the purposes indicated. I beg herewith to report the result of my investigations:— The Lee Navigation Stream stretches in a south-easterly direction from the Tottenham Lock past the Waterworks of the Eastern District, forming up to this point the eastern boundary of the Borough, whence it cuts across the Hackney Marsh in the same direction past Hackney Wick to Poplar. The character of the water in this part of the river varies at different seasons of the year. During the summer months the putrefactive processes are more active in the water, and during the winter months the river is frequently in flood, receiving pollutions of all kinds. During all times of the year the river receives a large amount of pollution from its floating population and from the towing path. At the time of my visit the water was turbid, partly due, no doubt, to some rain which had fallen a day or two before, and it did not present an inviting appearance for bathing. In order to get some idea of the character of the water at the present time, I had samples taken, one from a point about 40 yards below the old Tottenham sewage works, and another at Lea Bridge. I assume that if the Lee water from the Navigation Canal were used to supply a bathing pond, it would be taken from some part between these two points. Annexed is the result of the analyses. It will be seen that the Lee water of the Navigation Canal is an extremely polluted water. When the samples were taken the river was in partial flood, but it had not risen to any appreciable extent. Whilst the recent partial flooding of the river may have added a considerable amount of suspended matter, and a small quantity of organic matter to the water, I am of opinion, with this qualification, that the samples fairly represent the average condition of the water of the Lee Navigation Canal. Is this water in a fit condition for bathing purposes? The chief object in bathing is that of cleanliness; the secondary object, the acquision and use of a healthy exercise. With polluted water the former would not be attained, and the exercise would become dangerous and unhealthy. Swimming cannot be indulged in, 112 especially in fresh water, by learners, without some water being swallowed. Polluted water, such as that of the Lee Navigation Stream, would, if swallowed, set up intestinal disease. For these reasons, I am of opinion that the water of the Navigation Stream is unfit to be used for bathing purposes. 1 remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. KING-WARRY, M.D., D.P.H.

On letter dated 19th May, 1908, from the Secretary, Social Democratic Federation (Central Hackney Branch), forwarding copy resolution passed, upon the subject of the recent fire in Derby Road, Kingsland; also letter dated 25th May, 1908, with reference to the report of the Public Health Committee upon the same subject. Report of the Medical Officer of Health thereon, as follows:— Public Health Department, Town Hall, Hackney, N.E., 7th July, 1908. To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, Re Nos. 1 to 32, Derby Road, Kingsland. I beg herewith to lay before the Public Health Committee for their consideration certain circumstances in connection with the above-named property. A fire resulting in a lamentable loss of life which recently occurred at 11, Derby Road, has drawn public attention to this property, and has raised certain points which it is desirable that the Public Health Committee should deal with. The chief points under discussion have been:—1. That responsibility for the provision of means of escape from fire. 2. Overcrowding. 3. The provision of adequate sanitary conveniences. Escape from fire.—The question of fire in occupied dwellings is dealt with in the London Building Acts (Amendment) Act, 1905, in Sec. 9 (1), and Sec. 12 (1), herein quoted. London Building Acts (Amendment) Act, 1905. "9—(1) From and after the First day of January, One thousand nine hundred and seven, in the case of any existing building (except 115 a dwelling-house occupied as such by not more than one family) which is— (a) A high building; or (b) A building in which sleeping accommodation is provided for more than twenty persons or which is occupied by more than twenty persons or in which more than twenty persons are employed. The Council if in their opinion such building is not provided with proper and sufficient means of escape therefrom in case of fire may at any time serve on the owner of such building a notice requiring him to provide such means of escape as can be reasonably required under the circumstances of the case." "The expression 'upper storey' means any storey the level of the upper surface of the floor whereof is at a greater height than fifty feet above the level of the footway (if any) immediately in front of the centre of the face of the building in which such storey is situate or (where there is no such footway) above the level of the ground before excavation:" "The expression 'high building' means any building any storey whereof is an upper storey as hereinbefore defined:" "12—(1) (a) Every existing building to which the section of this Act whereof the marginal note is 'projecting shops' applies and every other existing building except a dwellinghouse occupied as such by not more than two families; and (b) Every new building; shall if having more than two storeys above the ground storey or if exceeding thirty feet in height be provided (unless and except so far as the Council otherwise allow) by the owner with either— (a) A dormer window or a door opening in a suitable position approved by the district surveyor on to the roof with proper access thereto; or (b) A trap door in a suitable position approved by the district surveyor, covered with copper or zinc and hung on h 2 116 hinges so as to admit of the same opening to the fullest extent and furnished with a counter weight so as to ensure that the same shall open automatically when unfastened, and also with a fixed or hinged step-ladder leading to the roof; or (c) Other proper means of access to the roof; and with a sufficient parapet or guard-rail where reasonably practicable and necessary to prevent persons slipping off the roof. Any dormer window or trap-door provided under this sub-section shall only be fastened in such a manner as to ensure access to the roof being always readily available from the inside of the building." From these sections two facts become obvious, firstly, that as the Building Acts are administered in London by the London County Council that body is responsible for enforcing the provision of means for escape from fire; secondly, that neither County Council nor Borough Council has any power to compel the provision of means of escape from fire in the Derby Road property, because owing to the conditions of occupancy and the height of the dwellings they are expressly exempt from the operations of the Act. Overcrowding.—Immediately the question of the sanitary condition of these premises was raised I had an inspection made. The premises 1 to 32, Derby Boad, consists of a row of three-storied houses. Almost every house is occupied by more than one family, the practice being for the whole house to be let to one tenant, who sublets portions of the house to lodgers. The facts referring to occupancy are set out in the annexed table. In considering the question of overcrowding in relation to premises of the Derby Road character, it is customary to apply the standard of cubic space for each occupant adopted in our By-laws for houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. The following are the special By-laws referred to:— "3. A lodger in a lodging-house and subject to the provisions of these By-laws, the landlord and tenant of the lodging-house shall not knowingly cause or suffer a greater 117 number of persons than will admit of the provision of three hundred cubic feet of free air space for each person of an age exceeding ten years, and of one hundred and fifty cubic feet of free air space for each person of an age not exceeding ten years to occupy, at any one time, as a sleeping apartment, a room which is used exclusively for that purpose, and which, in the case of a lodger, has been let to that lodger." "4. A lodger in a lodging-house and subject to the provisions of these By-laws, the landlord and tenant of the lodging-house shall not knowingly cause or suffer a greater number of persons than will admit of the provision of four hundred cubic feet of free air space for each person of an age exceeding ten years, and of two hundred cubic feet of free air space for each person of an age not exceeding ten years to occupy, at any one time, as a sleeping apartment, a room which is not used exclusively for that purpose, and which, in the case of the lodger, has been let to that lodger." On reference to the table of occupancy it will be seen that in only four of the tenements did the amount of cubic space fall below the above standard, i.e., in only four tenements was there overcrowding, and these were low degrees of overcrowding, i.e., in three instances to the extent of one child and in the other one adult too many in the available space. Sanitary Conveniences.—The adequacy of the provision of sanitary conveniences to these premises has been also questioned. On inspection it was found that each house was provided with one w.c., situated on the ground floor and approached from the yard. From the table before referred to it may be seen how many individuals in each house would use this convenience. It may be here stated that there is no fixed standard of w.c. accommodation for dwelling-houses. The provision of such accommodation in London is governed by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Sec. 37 (1), (3), (4b). 118 Regulations as to Water-closets, dc.—Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Sec. 37. 37—(1) It shall not be lawful newly to erect any bouse or to rebuild any house pulled down to or below the ground floor without a sufficient ashpit furnished with proper doors and coverings, and one or more proper and sufficient water-closets according as circumstances may require, furnished with suitable water supply and water supply apparatus, and with suitable trapped soilpan and other suitable works and arrangements, so far as may be necessary to ensure the efficient operation thereof. (2) If any person offends against the foregoing enactment of this section, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds. (3) If at any time it appears to the sanitary authority that any house, whether built before or after the commencement of this Act, is without such ash-pit or water-closets as aforesaid, the sanitary authority shall cause notice to be served on the owner or occupier of the house, requiring him forthwith, or within such reasonable time as is specified in the notice, to provide the same in accordance "with the directions in the notice, and if the notice is not complied with the said owner or occupier shall be liable to a fine not exceeding five pounds, and a further fine not exceeding forty shillings for each day during which the offence continues; or the sanitary authority, if they think fit, in lieu of proceeding for a fine, may enter on the premises and execute such works as the case may require, and may recover the expenses incurred by them in so doing from the owner of the house. (4) Provided that— (a) Where sewage or water supply sufficient for a water-closet is not reasonably available, this section shall be complied with by the provision of a privy or earthcloset; and (b) Where a water-closet has before the commencement of this Act been and is used in common by the 119 inmates of two or more houses, and in the opinion of the sanitary authority may continue to be properly so used, they need not require a water-closet to be provided for each house. (5) Any person who thinks himself aggrieved by any notice or act of a sanitary authority under this section may appeal to the County Council, whose decision shall be final. It appears clear from these sections that the local authority has power in individual cases to require owners of property to provide a sufficient number of water-closets for the convenience of occupants of private dwelling houses, regard being paid to the number of users of the same. An examination of the table herewith given will show that the number of occupants of these houses varies from two to twenty persons. Although I have not received any complaint from the occupants of these houses of inadequacy of water-closet accommodation, I am of opinion that in certain of them the sanitary conveniences, viewed both from the standpoint of sanitation and decency, are inadequate, and that the question of causing additional accommodation to be provided should receive the Committee's attention. With respect to the other nuisances, it was found on inspection that five of the houses had defective drains, and that several had minor defects as dilapidated dust bins, defective yard paving, and others required cleansing and minor repairs. Most of these defects have since been remedied. A further point which I should like the Committee to consider is the desirability or otherwise of registering the Derby Road houses as houses let in lodgings under the By-laws in force in the Borough, as they appear to be premises which might properly be registered, the rental for the tenements being such as to bring them within the operations of the By-laws if the Committee so desire. 120 I am, Gentleman, Your obedient Servant, J.

On letter from the London County Council, dated 12th February, 1908, calling attention to Sections 36 and 37 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, with reference to the cleansing of verminous [persons, and asking, before they make any definite arrangements to put the Act in force, to be favoured with information as to the extent of the provision already existing in the Borough of Hackney in regard to disinfection, &c., and the facilities which the Hackney Borough Council would be prepared to afford the Council in the matter. The Medical Officer of Health submitted the following Memorandum:— Memorandum on the means provided by the Hackney Borough Council for dealing with verminous persons under the Cleansing of Persons Act—by the Medical Officer of Health:— 1. Two bath rooms are provided, each containing one bath, full size, with hot and cold water, &c. These bath-rooms are quite separate and have separate entrances. One is reserved for males, and one for females. Each bath-room is provided with a hopper arrangement, communicating with the infected side of the disinfecting chamber, to receive the infected clothes for disinfection while persons are being bathed. 2. The duty of the staff at the cleansing station is to keep the bath and bath-room clean, to get the bath ready with soap, towels, and dressing-gown, and to disinfect the clothing. Hitherto we have insisted upon the parent or some adult attending with the children to superintend the cleansing of the child. In a few cases the hair of children attending to be cleansed has been cut by one of the staff. 122 3. The clothes are disinfected by high pressure saturated steam whilst the cleansing is taking place. 4. Carbolic soap is provided with a hot bath for persons affected with lice; a sulphur bath (¼lb.of potassium sulphide to 30 gallons of water), and yellow soap for cases of scabies. It was Resolved—That the London County Council be informed that this Council is prepared to afford them the above facilities for the purpose of dealing with persons in a verminous condition, provided that this Council is not called upon to incur any additional expenditure thereby.
