Ladies and Gentlemen, I nave pleasure in presenting my Annual Health Report for the year 1947, this being the twenty-fifth submitted by me as your Medical Officer of Health. The population of the District, as estimated by the Registrar-General at mid-year, was 70,580, as compared with 67,870 last year. The Birth Rate continues to remain steady, this being equal to 20.9 per thousand of population, as against 20.8 last year. A decrease again took place in the Death Rate, the Rate for the year being equal to 8.9 per thousand of population, as against 9.4 last year and 10 5 in 1945. A small increase took place in the Infantile Mortality Rate, this being equal to 29 per thousand registered births, as compared with 24 last year and 32 in 1945. During the year, 1,311 Certificates of Notification of Infectious Disease were received, as compared with 924 last year. This increase is mainly due to a larger number of cases of Measles being notified. The diseases accounting for the largest number of notifications were: Measles 630, Whooping Cough 293, and Scarlet Fever 199. As this is the last Annual Report which I shall place before you, I take the opportunity of expressing my grateful thanks to members of this and past Councils, who have, by their helpful and sympathetic support, rendered my task of carrying out the Public Health work of the District both easier and pieasanter. I should like also to thank all the officers of the Council for their continuing help and support, and especially during the difficult war years. In conclusion I desire to thank all members of the Public Health Department for their efficient services, and especially for their loyalty and for the happy relations which have always existed between us. I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, P. N. CAVE, Medical Officer of Health. 2 Urban District Council of Chislehurst and Sidcup PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE. H. N.

Notices. 1,206 Informal Notices were served, drawing the attention of property owners and others to the existence of nuisances and requesting abatement.

In 27 cases the remedial works were still outstanding at the end of the year. 4. Housing. (i) Routine Inspections. 339 visits were made to premises in connection with the Housing Act, 1936.
