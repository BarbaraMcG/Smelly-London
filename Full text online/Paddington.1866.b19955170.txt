(By Order) FREDERICK AVELING, Vestry Clerk. Vestry Hall; 12th July, 1867. SANITARY REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1866-67. BY J. BURDON SANDERSON, M.D., F.R.S., Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, Physician to the Hospital for Consumption, and Assistant Physician to Middlesex Hospital. LATE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. REPORT TO THE VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Vestry Hall; 13th July, 1807. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you the usual Annual Statement of the measures carried out during the year ending Lady Day, 1867, under the direction of the Sanitary Committee, for the maintenance and improvement of the Public Health in this Parish. Proceedings under the Local Management Act. During the twelve months which terminated March 25th, 1867, 675 preliminary Orders for the improvement of houses, or for the removal of nuisances, received the sanction of the Sanitary Committee. Of these, 527 have been complied with, while the rest have been transferred to the list for 1867. In my previous annual reports I have repeatedly had occasion to refer to delays and difficulties which had in every instance attended the proceedings' taken in this Parish for the enforcement of 12 the sanitary provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act. Under that Act there are two courses open to the Vestry in case of the failure of owners to comply with their orders. At the expiration of the time limited in their Notice for the completion of the requirements therein contained, they may either execute the works at the owner's expense, or they may proceed against him in the manner provided in the Act, for the recovery of the penalties to which his default renders him liable. Prior to 1866, the former of these courses was always pursued by the Vestry, at the advice and under the direction of their Solicitor. The results so obtained being very unsatisfactory, it was resolved by the Sanitary Committee early in 1866 to recommend to the Vestry the adoption of the other alternative. Accordingly, forms of order, applicable to the principal cases in which constructive works are required, were prepared by the Vestry Solicitor at the request of the Sanitary Committee. These were approved by the Vestry on the 19th of March, last year, when it was also resolved that the old mode of proceeding should be abandoned, and that in future penalties should be recovered, in accordance with the terms of the Notice, in all cases of default. The success which has attended this measure has been most satisfactory. No less than 78 cases have been reported to the Vestry by the Committee in which their preliminary notices had been neglected. In each instance Orders were made 13 by the Vestry, to the number in all of 105 in the course of the following twelve months. Of these Orders many were complied with before the expiration of the periods limited. In all the rest, proceedings were taken at the Police Court, and penalties amounting to £39:13:0 were inflicted, some of which, however, were subsequently mitigated with the consent of the Sanitary Committee, on the eventual compliance of the owners of property with their requirements. In every case the necessary works have sooner or later been carried out. For this comparatively favourable result the Vestry are lafgely indebted to the impartial attention which has been accorded to the sanitary business of this Parish by Mr. Mansfield, before whom all the cases have been heard. Much credit is also due to the zeal and ability with which the proceedings have been conducted by the Inspector of Nuisances. In my last Report I gave an account of the steps taken in the beginning of 1866 against the owner of the houses Nos. 36—48 North Wharf Road, who had so repeatedly disregarded the Orders of the Vestry. By direction of the Sanitary Committee I took part in a conference held between the Vestry Solicitor and that gentleman on the 1st of May, 1866, at which he promised, in accordance with my recommendation—(1) To construct at his own expense in rear of the houses, in the course of the insufficient drain then existing, a pipe-drain of suitable size and inclination, with branches 14 nected with each inlet. (2) To provide proper water-closets in each house, having their cisterns so fixed, and their water supply apparatus so constructed and arranged as to ensure the efficient scouring of the soil pan: and (3) To carry out these and all other necessary works under the supervision of the Surveyor. It is satisfactory to be able to state that these improvements, which have occupied the attention of the Sanitary Committee for many years, were eventually, though after much delay, thoroughly completed. With reference to the reconstruction of the drainage of Alfred Road, I much regret that I cannot report any progress since the date of my last account. The houses are drained on the same plan as those in North Wharf Road, and the same remedy is applicable in the one case as in the other. As previously stated, the matter was placed in the hands of the Highway Committee, who in January, 1866, ordered that estimates should be prepared. The further steps taken will be recorded in the next Annual Statement. Proceedings under the Nuisances Removal Act. In my last Report I referred in detail to the proceedings under the Nuisances Removal Act against the owner of No. 15, Church Place, who, having been convicted on the 14th of March, after two adjournments, disregarded the Order then made, so as to place the Local Authority under the necessity of carrying out the requirements of the 15 Magistrate at his expense. In this case the works were satisfactorily completed, but the greatest difficulty was experienced in recovering the expenses. The same defendant was again summoned on the 9th of June in respect of No. 18, Church Place, and convicted. The works were carried out, though in so imperfect a manner as barely to satisfy the requirements of the Order. The defendant was warned that in case the nuisance should recur, the premises would be closed as unfit for occupation. The owner of No. 11 Park Road was proceeded against on the 9th of June for the general filthiness of the premises and the improper keeping of animals. The case was adjourned, the defendant having given an engagement in writing to abate the nuisance and make the necessary improvements. This he subsequently did. The same defendant was also summoned on the 18th of August, during the prevalence of Cholera, in respect of No. 3, Carlton Place, as to which I reported last year that although material improvements had been effected, some of the most important requirements of the Sanitary Committee had not been complied with. I referred particularly to the improper position of the water-closets and the defective ventilation of the houses, which were such as to render them dangerous to health. These evils have been at last satisfactorily remedied. On the 16th of June complaint was made against a horse-keeper in Hermitage Street. At the 16 adjourned hearing on the 23rd, the defendant was convicted: an Order (which has since been carried out) was made for the amendment of the paving and drainage of his stable; and he was further required to remove the manure three times a week. During the prevalence of cholera, proceedings were taken against several dealers in rags, for the purpose of restraining the accumulation of offensive matters on their premises. Two of these cases were heard on the 18th of August, evidence being given in each instance by the Medical Inspector in charge of the district in which the alleged nuisance existed. As it appeared to the Magistrate that the evil complained of had been mitigated, he dismissed the charges, after warning the defendants that in case the nuisance should be repeated he would make an Order and impose penalties. Similar proceedings were taken on the 21st of September against the occupier of a large rag store at No. 101, Star Street, the allegation being that "putrid "parings of meat, ham-skimmings, bones, and "other substances so foul as to be a nuisance "injurious to health," were found on the premises. Medical evidence having been given that serious disease had arisen in the neighbourhood in consequence, the defendant was convicted, and ordered to remove immediately the offensive accumulations and to cleanse and limewash the premises; a permanent order was also made requiring the defendant to adopt precautions for the proper regulation of the trade in future. Proceedings for the abatement of overcrowding 17 were taken against the owner of No. 17, Dudley Street, on the 16th June. The defendant having engaged to discontinue the unlawful occupation of his premises, the further hearing was adjourned to the 29th, when it appeared that he had ejected his tenant and thoroughly cleansed the overcrowded room. Similar proceedings were taken on the 1st September against the owners of No. 1A, Caroline Place, and No. 2, Francis Street, with satisfactory results. Proceedings under the Padding ton Local Act. The line of action initiated in 1865 for restraining the undue detention of manure on the wharves has been pursued during the past year with greater success. As during the epidemic of cholera the Sanitary Committee were anxious to use every available means for placing the Parish in a good state of defence against the threatened danger, it was resolved to repeat the experiment which had unfortunately failed before, of enforcing the important sanitary provisions contained in the 69th section of the Paddington Local Act. Accordingly, after due notice had been given, proceedings were taken against certain parties engaged in the manure trade for the recovery of penalties incurred by them for various acts in contravention of these provisions. The first cases were heard on the 15th of October, when several Owners of barges and manure-dealers were convicted and fined 20s. each. In order that all persons concerned might in future be well aware of their liability, notice was given by C 18 conspicuous placards that proceedings would be promptly taken by the Vestry against all persons committing any of the undermentioned Offences contrary to the Provisions of the Paddington Local Act, 5th George IV., cap. 126, for the prevention of Nuisances: Depositing any Noisome or Offensive Matter on anyplace or Wharf within 500 yards of any dwelling.house; Discharging any Cart, Boat, Barge or other conveyance, containing any Noisome or Offensive Matter, otherwise than at once from the same into some other conveyance directly ; Detaining any such Cart, Boat, Barge or other conveyance more than 12 hours after any such Offensive Matter shall have been placed therein; Using any Cart or conveyance for the reception of any Offensive Matter, which is not properly constructed to prevent the escape of smell; and that the Sanitary and Public Health Committee would proceed summarily against Offenders for full Penalties in all future cases. Although the effect of this measure was satisfactory, it was again found necessary to have recourse to the Police Magistrate. On the 13th of November several wharfingers were summoned; in some of the cases substantial fines were inflicted, while in others the penalties were merely nominal. Again, on the 9th of January two wharfingers were fined 40s. each, and one 20s.; on the 14th of February a wharfinger was fined 10s.; and on the 28th another 5s.; and similar convictions have taken place since. In all these cases the offences 19 consisted in the undue detention of manure or other offensive matter on wharves or in barges. The Section was also successfully brought to bear in another direction. On the 13th of November, complaint was made against Mr. Thomas Ferguson, the well known contractor "for using a "cart for the conveyance of offensive matter, the "same not being properly constructed so as to "prevent the escape of offensive smell." * The case was proved, but in consideration of the fact that the cart complained of was of the kind usually employed in London for the purpose in question, no fine was imposed. The further hearing was adjourned in order that a model cart might be constructed, in accordance with the requirements of the Vestry. The model having been completed, and approved on inspection by the Sanitary Committee, the case was dismissed, on the understanding that Mr. Ferguson would provide himself sufficient carts of similar construction, and would in future employ them for the conveyance of all offensive refuse through the public streets. Lastly, a conviction was obtained on the 15th of December, under the same Section, against a builder, in respect of an accumulation of offensive animal and vegetable matters used in the *It is proper to state that in this case the proceedings were of a friendly character, the object being to establish the illegality of conveying offensive matters through the streets in uncovered carts. 20 tion of a roadway in the immediate neighbourhood of inhabited houses. Proceedings under the Sanitary Act, 1866. The Sanitary Act passed last Session confers on the Vestry powers of very great value for the maintenance of public health,several of which have been beneficially exercised in the Parish during the short period which has elapsed since it came into force. The first in importance of its powers is unquestionably that which enables the Nuisance Authority, with the sanction of the Secretary of State, to make regulations as to lodgings. Strongly convinced that great sanitary benefits would result from the exercise of this power in certain parts of Paddington, I lost no time in introducing the subject in one of my fortnightly Reports. On the 3rd of January the question was carefully considered by the Sanitary Committee, who appointed a Sub.Committee of their number to prepare draft regulations, which, having been approved of, were finally submitted to the Vestry. The further steps which have been taken in this matter will come within the scope of the next Annual Statement. The 22nd Section gives power to the Local Authority to cause premises in which contagious disease has occurred, to be cleansed and disinfected ; and it is further provided in the 39th Section that if any person "knowingly lets any house, room, or "part of a house in which any person suffering "from any dangerous infectious disorder has been, 21 "to any other person, without having such house, "room, or part of a house, and all articles therein "liable to retain infection, disinfected to the "satisfaction of a qualified Medical Practitioner, "as testified by a certificate given by him, such "person shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding "£20." During the outbreak of small.pox, which occurred in January, February and March, these Sections were applied in very numerous instances. In every case where small.pox was reported (unless it was known that proper measures of precaution had been already taken) a notice was served on the occupier of the house in which the patient resided, requiring him to use means for disinfection. In order to ensure the effectual performance of this duty, the owners of property were advised to have it carried out, whenever possible, under the immediate supervision of the Inspector, who invariably visited the premises at the same time that he delivered to the parties interested the printed form of notice. With a similar view the Vestry sanctioned the employment of a labourer and the use of chemicals at the public expense in all cases in which there appeared reasonable ground for supposing that the requirements of the notice could not be otherwise satisfactorily carried out. The good thus effected was, unquestionably, very great, not merely because it ensured the adoption of the best means for preventing the spread of the disease through the clothes and bedding of the sick, but because it inspired confidence into the minds of those who were exposed to infection, and thus by quieting their apprehension, diminished their risk. 22 By another Section, the 37th, the Vestry are enabled "to enter into any agreement with any "person or body of persons having the manage"ment of any hospital for the reception of the sick "inhabitants of its district, on payment by the "Authority of such annual or other sum as may be "agreed upon." Accordingly, on the 4th of January, the Sanitary Committee authorized me to confer with the Guardians of St. Marylebone as well as with the Managers of the Small.pox Hospital. As a result of these conferences, the Committee subsequently recommended the Vestry to make an arrangement with the Managers of the Smallpox Hospital for the reception of patients at £3:3:0 each. This recommendation was not acceded to. In accordance with the 53rd Section, notice was given by placards posted in conspicuous places throughout the Parish for the periodical removal of manure; and in one instance proceedings were taken for the recovery of penalties. As, however, these proceedings failed in consequence of a technical difficulty, it appeared to the Sanitary Committee that no advantage would be gained by repeating the experiment. Appointment of an Assistant Inspector. On the 3rd of May the Sanitary Committee, in consideration of the great increase in the Parish of houses requiring Sanitary supervision, and the augmentation of the duties devolving on the 23 spector in attending to complaints, in the preparation of notices, and in business connected with proceedings at the Police Court, resolved that it was necessary to appoint an additional Officer, whose sole duty it should be to assist in carrying out the systematic house to house visitation which the apprehended advent of Cholera rendered so necessary. Accordingly, a temporary Assistant was appointed, who was employed from the 25th of May until the end of September, when his services were discontinued on account of ill health. During the prevalence of the epidemic, a second Assistant was engaged (as Has been already stated in the Report of the Special Committee), who after its decline was employed in similar duties under the order of the Sanitary Committee. On the 5th of February the Office of Assistant Inspector was made permanent; his principal duty being to visit in each week such houses as he should be instructed by the Medical Officer of Health to inspect, and to report daily on their condition. The Canal Basin. I have this year little to add to the long history of the transactions of the Sanitary Committee with reference to the Canal Basin. Early in the summer some correspondence took place between myself, on behalf of the Committee, and the Company, as to the process of dredging which was then being carried on in the neighbourhood of Warwick Crescent, to the great annoyance of the 24 tants. In consequence of my remonstrance, the dredging was immediately discontinued; and it was agreed that nothing of the kind should be again attempted during the summer months. Whether, as a result of the thorough cleansing which the Basin had received during the previous year, or of the moderate temperature of the season, the water remained in a tolerable state during the whole of July. As soon as it appeared necessary, I requested that the Basin should be emptied, which was accordingly done, the Basin remaining empty three hours. Large quantities of foul deposit were found opposite the manure wharves, as well as at the east end of the Basin. Of this only a small quantity could be removed in so short a time, the rest remaining for a more favourable opportunity. Offensive Trades. During the past year, further improvement has taken place in the condition of the manure wharves in consequence of the enforcement of regulations based on the provisions of the Local Act. The principle long contended for by the Sanitary Committee, that all manure or other offensive refuse should at once be shot from the carts in which it is collected into the barges in which it is to be conveyed into the country, without being deposited on the wharves, is now recognized by the Wharfingers as a rule, of which the infringement will not be tolerated by the Vestry. As a consequence, the manure trade which in former years was so great 25 a nuisance as to attract the attention of the whole community, is now carried on in a much more wholesome and inoffensive manner. It would have been still more satisfactory if I had been able to report its complete removal from the Parish. Great improvements have been introduced into the collection and sifting of dust and domestic refuse. On the one hand, as already stated, the obligation to employ only such carts for the conveyance of offensive matter as are specially constructed and approved by the Sanitary Authorities for the purpose,has been fully recognized by the Contractors. On the other, the process of dust sifting has been accelerated by the substitution of machinery for hand labour. By this improvement, the character of the process has entirely changed, and its injurious effects on the public health diminished. While progress has been made in these directions, another standing nuisance,even more injurious to health, though perhaps not so productive of annoyance, remains undiminished. The half liquid mud charged with animal impurity which is scraped from the streets by the scavengers, is still stored in enormous quantities in the very centre of the Parish; and in a closely inhabited neighbourhood. Here it is allowed to decompose gradually until it attains the proper consistence for exportation, during which process offensive gases and other more dangerous products of putrefaction D 26 are freely disengaged. If it were intended to contrive an arrangement for developing malaria in the midst of a town population, nothing could be better adapted for the purpose. In fact, the conditions are precisely those which are recognized as the source of danger in those countries in which malarious diseases are endemic. The subject has been very frequently under discussion by the Sanitary Committee. I regret, that though so strongly impressed with its importance, I have been unable to suggest a practicable remedy ; and I can only express the hope that my successor in office will be more fortunate.* Small.pox. During the months of December, January, February and March, small.pox prevailed throughout the Metropolis, and cases occurred in *There are three ways in which the material swept from the paved streets and macadamised roads becomes a source of disease. By the use of grit as an ingredient in mortar, a quantity of animal matter containing infectious germs is introduced into the construction of the houses of the poor. This practice affords, as I have been long convinced, the true explanation of the otherwise inexplicable fact that, although as a rule newly built houses are better provided with sanitary appliances and better drained than old houses, contagious diseases, and especially scarlet fever, prevail more fatally in the former than in the latter. I would further instance the use of slop collected from macadamised roads, as a material for constructing roadways, which has long and justly been regarded as a fruitful source of unhealthiness. Lastly, the storage of slop alluded to in the text. 27 various parts of the Parish. The preventive measures employed were of the following nature:— (1) In all the localities as to which information was received that the disease had appeared, house to house visitation was immediately made, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the children had been vaccinated. In all cases of neglect, information was given to the Vaccinator of the district; and, in addition, a special notice was handed to* the parents, requiring them forthwith to have the unvaccinated child vaccinated. During the months of January and February, 347 houses, inhabited by 1435 families, were visited with reference to vaccination; 88 notices were served on parents, all of which were eventually complied with. (2) Whenever small.pox was known to exist, the most efficient measures of disinfection were carried out under my orders: infected linen and wearing apparel were soaked in water containing an ounce of solution of chloride of soda in each gallon; such articles as could not be so cleansed being burnt or otherwise destroyed.* The ceilings and walls of infected rooms were washed with quicklime water, and the wood.work cleansed with soap and water; in addition to which, the practice was usually followed of disengaging chlorine by pouring dilute sulphuric acid over chloride of lime in ajar, and allowing it to remain in any room * In those, the parties, if poor, received compensation. 28 which had been occupied by a person affected with small.pox, for twenty.four hours. Of 42 houses which were reported as infected, 28 were cleansed in the manner above described, by a labourer employed by the Vestry. Of the remainder, live were disinfected by the owners, under the supervision of the Inspector; while of the nine others, certificates of disinfection were received from the Medical Men in attendance, in accordance with the Sanitary Act, in respect of all but one. It is satisfactory to add that, although the disease was so generally diffused throughout the Parish, only six persons died, of whom two were infants. Slaughter.houses and Cow.houses. Forty.nine persons gave notice, as required by law, of their intention to apply at the Special Sessions to be held in October for Licences to keep Slaughter.houses or Cow.houses. Of the applications for licences to keep cows, four were objected to by the Vestry, viz.: those relating to 6, Carlton Place, 60, Market Street, 20, Bayswater Terrace, and Maryland Farm. Of these, the first two were refused; the third was granted with a caution; while the last was suspended in order that the necessary improvements might be carried out. The applications of four other cow keepers were also suspended for various reasons. In all these cases the licences were eventually given. 29 Public.houses. In February, I requested the Inspector to make the systematic visitation of all the public houses in the Parish, for the purpose of ascertaining the condition of the urinals and water.closets, directing his attention specially to those known to be defective. The results of this inspection were embodied in a Report which I submitted to the Chairman of the Special Sessions, held here on Monday, the 4th of March, In several of the cases, in which it appeared to the Licensing Magistrate that the arrangements were unsatisfactory, the licences were suspended for a month, in order that the applicants might have time to carry out the necessary improvements. In this way, several nuisances which had long been subjects of complaint were dealt with in such a manner as to be satisfactory alike to the owners of property and to the public. In concluding this Report, I have pleasure in calling your attention to the unusual progress which has been made during the year in the sanitary administration of the Parish. Important works of house improvement, the necessity of which had been long recognized, have been successfully completed ; many standing nuisances have been abated, and the offensive trades carried on around the Canal Basin have been subjected to wholesome 30 regulations.

LIGHTING AND SEWERS DEPARTMENTS. By GEORGE F. STEVENS, surveyor. 1 REPORT TO THE VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Vestry Hall; June, 1867. Gentlemen, I beg to submit a Report of Works executed in the Paving, Lighting and Sewer Departments, during the year ending March 25th, 1867:— Improvements. The four open spaces within the enclosure of Paddington Green have been fenced off, planted with Trees, Shrubs and Flowers, and laid out in plots of Grass with Gravel Footpaths formed around them, and Garden Seats fixed in suitable positions. The Bridge, so long complained of on account of its narrowness (21 feet in width) over the Canal in Harrow Road at Westbourne Green, belonging to the Grand Junction Canal Company, has been taken down and another constructed in its place, 50 feet wide. The cost of the new Bridge, with 42 the expense of raising and widening the Road, now in progress on the North side, will probably amount to £ 6000. Of this sum the Metropolitan Board of Works have agreed to contribute £ 1500, and the remainder will have to be defrayed out of the Parochial Rates. The old and worn-out Pavements in the footways and channels of Albion Street, Cambridge Street and Porchester Place, have been removed, an increase has been made in their widths, and the whole have been re-paved with the best materials now in use. The old Pebble and Rag Stone Paving in Southwick Mews and Oxford Mews, have been taken up and used for macadamizing purposes in other parts of the Parish, and the whole have been re-paved with new Granite Cubes suitable for the purpose. The Footpaths in Edgware Road, opposite Canterbury and Carlton Villas, and around the Enclosures of Sussex Gardens and Paddington Green, and in Harrow Road, from Ranelagh Bridge to Queen's Road Bridge, have been paved throughout ; other Footways have been protected by a Granite Kerb. Thirty-three Crossings have been paved with the usual description of Stones. 43 General Works. Thirteen additional Streets, or portions of Streets, have been cleansed, watered and repaired ; which, with the previously existing Streets, make 37 miles 7 furlongs and 155 yards, now under the jurisdiction of the Vestry. Eight New Streets, or portions of Streets, have been formed and paved under the powers of the Metropolis Management Acts, 1855 and 1862, at the cost of the Owners of Property. The number of openings made by Gas and Water Companies, and various Parties, in the Streets, and which have been reinstated at their expense, amount to 2096. Lighting. Thirty-one additional Lamps have been erected in various parts of the Parish, making a total of 1509. Twenty-nine Lamps have been removed to new positions where Footways had been widened, and in Streets requiring additional Lamps for the better lighting thereof. 44 Buildings, Sewers and Drains. Forty-five Notices have been given to the Vestry for the erection of 144 Buildings, namely, 92 Houses, 51 Stables and 1 Church, in accordance with the 76th Section of the Act of 1855. Seventy-six applications for the re-construction of Drains under the Public Roads and Footways, to 94 Houses and Premises, have been received, and the Works executed at the expense of Owners of Property. Sewers in the undermentioned Streets and Places have been constructed by the Owners of Property at their expense:— The Metropolitan Railway} ft. in. ft. in. .

Three miles twelve hundred yards of Brick Sewers, in which the deposit varied from six to eighteen inches in depth, have been cleansed, and the hard deposit removed, at a cost to the Vestry of £ 143:3:7. Seventy-six Gulleys have been repaired, five side entrances to Sewers, two ventilating Shafts, and one hundred and seventeen Gulley Drains constructed in various parts of the Parish. One hundred and sixty-seven Gulleys have been cleansed at a cost to the Vestry of £18:17:9.
