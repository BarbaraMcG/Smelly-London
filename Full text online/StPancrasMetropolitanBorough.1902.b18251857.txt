PANCRAS. From careful perusal and comparison of the figures relating to the Census of 1901, set out in my previous Annual Report, a number of interesting inferences can be drawn, and especially in regard to the condition of housing of the population, 17 Between the Census of 1881 and that of 1891, the number of inhabited houses in St. Pancras decreased from 24,705 to 24,443, some 262, and the population from 236,363 to 234,379, some 1,984 persons. Between the Census of 1891 and the recent Census of 1901, and taking the neu boundary as the area of the Borough, the number of inhabited houses decreased from 24,511 in 1891, to 23,715 in 1901, some 796 houses, but the number of inhabitants increased from 234,749 to 235,317, some 568 persons. And it must be also remembered that the houses that are demolished are mostly houses of six, eight, or ten rooms, and that the new houses erected are mostly artizans' buildings containing a number of dwellings of less than five rooms. If we go closer into the movement of population, we find that between 1881 and 1891, the natural increase of the population (that is, the excess of births over deaths) during the ten years was 25,456, but at the Census of 1891 it was found that the population had actually decreased by 1,984 persons, so that no less than 27,440 persons had migrated from St. Pancras. Between 1891 and 1901 the excess of births over deaths during the ten years was 20,897, but at the Census of 1901 the actual increase was only 533 persons, so that 20,364 persons had migrated from St. Pancras. In fact, from 2,700 to 2,300 persons migrate from St. Pancras every year; there is no room for them, and those that remain are packed closer in the houses, as shown by the fact that the number and size of the inhabited houses are decreasing, and the number of population is increasing. If we look at the statistics of tenements, we find that the number of one-room tenements decreased between 1891 and 1901 by some 1,951, and that the two, three, and four room tenements increased 607, 721, and 953, respectively, making an increase of 7,189 rooms; but then the five or more room tenements decreased by 630, and these tenements generally represented 6, 8, and 10 roomed houses, so that the 630 must be multiplied by 8 at least to find the decreased number of rooms, namely, 5,040, to which must be added the 1,951 single rooms, making a total diminution of rooms equal to the total increase. From which it may be assumed that during the ten years 189l-1901, there was no increase of dwelling accommodation, and as a matter of fact the Census of 1901 showed a decrease of 300 in the total number of dwellings of all kinds in St. Pancras. The number of persons occupying this diminished number of tenements was increased by 938. So that, during the last decennium in 300 fewer dwellings 938 more persons were housed, but at the same time the number of persons living in one room diminished by 6,857 and the number living in two, three, four, and five or more rooms, increased, respectively, by 931, 1,779, 4,233, and 852, a total of 7,795, equalling the 6,857 + 938. 18 METEOROLOGY.

Schools, Training Ships, &c., about250 POPULATION. The figures of the 1901 Census have been taken as a basis and the 2237 inmates of Extra Borough Institutions have been added to the Sub-Districts in proportion to the population as the deaths amongst these inmates are included in the Statistics in the year, and 500 non-residents in the hospitals in the Borough have been omitted as their deaths are also omitted.

At the end of the Report, in Table 7c, will be found set out the number of deaths under 5 years of age and at 5 years upwards, from each of the Notifiable Infectious Diseases in the respective Registration Sub-Districts, and the entire District of St. Pancras. In Table 8, in a similar manner, the deaths from the non-notifiable "principal zymotic diseases" will be found set out. From these two Tables the mortality of the respective diseases, and of each of the groups, have been obtained, as shown in Tables Nos. 9a and b, and Tables Nos. 10a and b, and as compared as follows :— Phthisis. —This disease, the type of the tubercular group of diseases, was the cause of 454 deaths compared to 445 deaths in 1901, 477 in 1900, and 481 in the year previous to that.

The excess of births over deaths is only 0.3 per 1000 in the Tottenham Court Sub-District and 3.3 per 1000 in the Gray's Inn Lane, rising to 8'6 per 1000 in Somers Town. So that, although Somers Town has the highest death- 26 rate at all ages, followed by Gray's Inn Lane and Tottenham Court, the deathrate is more largely infantile in proportion to the population at other ages. Whereas the death-rate from phthisis, mainly a disease of adults due to conditions of housing and occupation is highest in Tottenham Court, followed by Gray's Inn Lane, and then by Somers Town. The death-rate of the infantile respiratory, infectious, and zymotic diseases are highest in Somers Town. But the influences adverse to infant and child-life generally appear to be greatest in Gray's Inn Lane and Tottenham Court, followed at some little distance by Somers Town. The age and sex distribution of the population in a given area must be reckoned with in considering the birth and death-rates. Unfortunately the age and sex of the populations in Sub-Districts are not published. INFLUENZA.

In the "Final Report of the Medical Officer of Health upon the small-pox epidemic of 1901-2 in St. Pancras and London,"dated 7th January, 1903, and printed in the Minutes of the Council, of the 14th January, there appeared a complete history of the epidemic, together with full statistical tables. The main facts brought out in that Report were— 1.—That there was no decided and permanent fall in the small-pox morlality in London until after the year 1885, and the Metropolitan Asylums Board had removed the Small-pox Hospitals out of London. 2.—That although the utmost promptitude in removal to Hospital was practised in those cases diagnosed or suspected to be small-pox, yet the delay in other cases in the recognition of the symptoms, and in the seeking of medical advice by patients, or by persons in charge of them, and also in the mistaking of small-pox for chicken-pox, and other disease'', were large factors in the spread of the disease amongst a susceptible community, even when the small-pox Hospitals had been removed to a distance from the Metropolis. 3.—That the proportion of cases notified and of deaths certified during the previous six years in London, showed that the case fatality per cent, was rising, and that the gradually increasing number of unvaccinated persons, with the consequent accumulation of a more and more susceptible population, culminated in the epidemic of 1901-2. At the commencement of the epidemic the earliest local outbreaks in several parts of London appeared in a number of instances to be due to unrecognized cases, probably imported from abroad, especially Paris, and manifested themselves amongst laundry workers handling dirty and probably infected linen, and amongst persons in contact with travellers and others suffering from symptoms to which no attention was paid, or which were erroneously regarded as less serious eruptions, especially chicken-pox. Experience further showed how difficult it often was to recognise modified small-pox, how numerous were the doubtful cases, and what great opportunities small-pox thus possessed of spreading unsuspectedly and uncontrolled through a susceptible community. The course of the epidemic demonstrated the necessity for four series of precautions apart from vaccination, for the prevention of the spread of smallpox— (A) the prompt finding and recognition of small-pox cases, (B) the rapid dealing with cases when discovered and diagnosed, (C) the dealing with persons in contact as to their health, cleanliness, and clothing, and (D) the better isolation of small-pox Hospitals. These series of precautions indicated the requirement of the following measures:— (A.) Discovery of Small-pox Cases. 1.—The disclosure of suspicious eruptions by the notification of chicken-pox by patients, or persons in charge, when small-pox threatens. 2.—The confirmation by further medical examination, and at least a second opinion, of doubtful cases, before pronouncing them definitely to be "not small-pox." 31 (B.) Dealing with Small.-pox Patients. 3.—The prompt notification by medical certificate. 4.—The rapid removal of the patient to hospital. 5.—The immediate and thorough disinfection and cleansing of the infected parts of houses and their contents. (C.) Dealing with Small-pox Contacts. 6.—Inquiry as to the names, ages, addresses, occupations, and places of occupation of all contacts. 7.—Observation of contacts as to the continuation of good health until the expiry of the incubation period, and this implies the preventing of contacts without fixed abode from changing their dwelling places until the expiry of the incubation period of at least a fortnight, but does not necessitate interfering with their fixed occupations. 8.—Personal cleansing and disinfection of contacts and their clothing. 9. —Disinfection of Laundry-linen before being handled in laundries both for the prevention of small-pox and of other diseases readily conveyed by body-linen and bed-linen. (D.) The better Isolation of Small-pox Hospitals. 10.—A wider danger radius round small-pox Hospitals than the present requirement of the Local Government Board of a quarter of a mile, within which it is dangerous to allow a person to reside or work unless protected by a previous attack of small-pox or by vaccination within a limited period of years. These precautionary measures are indicated by the important facts:— (1) That small-pox is a disease which is many degrees more infectious than the most infectious of dangerous infectious diseases, and whereas in other dangerous infectious diseases the number of contacts infected are counted by units, in small-pox they are counted by tens. (2) That the infection of small-pox is much more readily carried than that of other dangerous infectious diseases by the person and clothing, not only of patients, but also of healthy persons who have been in contact with patients, and who, although not attacked by the disease, convey the infection to others, who become victims of the disease. (3) That unlike any other dangerous infectious disease, small-pox spreads beyond the hospital in which patients suffering from the disease are isolated, and that this striking distance is measured by quarters of a mile. Of these indicated precautionary measures, those (A) for the discovery of small-pox cases were met by providing for disclosure by the compulsory notification of chicken-pox, and for recognition by the confirmation of diagnosis by additional medical examination. Those measures (B) for tho prompt notification and removal of patients and the thorough subsequent disinfection, being already in action, were quickened and strengthened. But, when the measures (C) for dealing with small pox contacts came to be applied, it was found that inquiry failed from time to time to elicit true information 32 as to the names, ages, addresses, occupations, and places of occupation of contacts, that observation of contacts from time to time could not be carried out in the case of persons without fixed abode, or who may change their residence without a moment's notice, that the personal cleansing and disinfection of contacts and their clothing was avoided in some cases for various reasons, that the disinfection of laundry linen was not carried out in laundries ; also that the measures (D) for the isolation of small-pox patients were partly ineffectual, and healthy persons working or living in the neighbourhood of a small-pox Hospital carried the disease to their families or friends, and that infection spread from the hospital to communities at a distance. It became apparent that additional provisions are required for dealing with contacts in the prevention of the spread of small-pox and upon these lines:— (1) That it be declared an offence to refuse or withhold information or give false information with respect to persons living in a house in which small-pox has broken out, with regard to their names, employment, or occupation, schools attended by their children, or as to any person not living in such house but employed therein. (2) That it be provided that any person inhabiting any part of a house in which a case of small-pox breaks out, who knowingly associates with other persons, without having his or her own person and clothes cleansed and disinfected, be liable to a penalty. (3) That in laundries the examining, sorting, or marking of dirty linen be prohibited by the Home Office as dangerous, under the Factory and Workshop Acts, until after it has been effectually disinfected by boiling and washing in strong soap and water, or by some other equally effectual means. (4) That in common lodging houses and poor men's hotels, e.g., Rowton Houses, &c., when small-pox breaks out inmates be prohibited from leaving the house until after the expiration of a fortnight from the date of removal of the patient, except to be removed to a small-pox hospital or to a quarantine station. Provided that this prohibition do not apply to inmates that submit to immediate disinfection and cleansing of their clothing and person, and undertake to remain in residence at the house during the above-mentioned period, and to submit themselves to medical examination when required. Provided also that the Sanitary Authority be empowered to make such compensation as they may consider adequate to any inmates complying with any requirements they may make. (5) That small-pox hospitals be required by the Local Government Board to provide an area of wider radius, free from workers and residents. It may be said that such provisions are ideal, but so long as all the possible measures for the prevention of small-pox remain unexhausted, so long will the opposition to vaccination remain; and that if it can be proved that the application of these ideally-complete measures of prevention fail in actual practice, the stronger the case in favour of vaccination and revaccination becomes. 33 Additional Medical Examination.—The results of additional medical examinations of cases in St. Pancras presenting pocks, rashes, or symptoms suggestive of small-pox or allied diseases, are set out in the following Table, which speaks for itself.

As illustrations of the exceedingly infectious nature of small-pox some groups of a typical nature may be mentioned. These embrace (1) a street group, (2) a common lodging-house group, (3) a cubicle lodging-house group, (4) a family group, (5) a public house group, and (6) a hospital group. (1) The T— Street Group.—The first case of small-pox was an unrecognised case occurring in a sorter of dirty linen who was treated at home for measles and chickenpox, and infected her two sisters who infected L— B—, a female, aged two years and four months in the next house, who was certified on the 14th of August. The child sickened on August 6th and was regarded as suffering from chickenpox, she died on August 11th, but it was not known to the Public Health Department until the 14th that the child had died of smallpox, and as soon as the certificate was received the body was removed to the Infectious Mortuary. In the mean time the patient had been visited by her relatives and friends, A— A—, her sister-in-law of 41 S— Street, became infected and 13 other cases occurred in T— Street making a total of 16. Two other cases occurred at 41 S— Street, and a child living in G— Street contracted the disease while playing with other children in T— Street, while A— H— living at K— Street was removed to hospital after having visited friends in T— Street. Two officers of the Borough Council became infected. 34 This group contained 23 cases consisting of 10 males, 6 females, and 7 children under ten years of age, and extended over a period from August 1st to September 20th. (2) The H— Street Common Lodging Home Group.- On November 2nd a communication was received stating that E— W—had been removed from Charing Cross Hospital and that he gave an address at a C. L. H. in II— Street; the source of infection in this case was not discovered, Nine other lodgers in this house became infected and all the occupants refused re-vaccination. The barmaid from a neighbouring public house, used by these lodgers, not feeling well went home to her relatives at Islington from where she was removed. On November 14th, R— M— of L - Street was attacked, and stated that he saw the above E — W— in Covent Garden Market and accompanied him to Charing Cross Hospital. « A— A— of 0— Crescent was removed to hospital having been out with one of the lodgers from the infected house. A— II— of P— W— Crescent was an associate of some of these men and was in the habit of drinking with them in the above public house ; he fell ill and was removed to hospital, and so was his wife and also his two children. This group contained 16 cases, and included 12 males, 3 females and 1 child under 10, and lasted from November 2nd to December 11th. (3) The R— H— Cubicle Lodging-house Group.— The II — H— is a large cubicle lodging-house in K. C. Road which nightly accommodates six or seven hundred lodgers, and small-pox broke out on three distinct occasions. The first case occurred on 7th December, 1901; the infection did not spread. The second occasion was that of a man who was removed from the Workhouse, who fell ill on the second day after admission; up to the time of entering the Workhouse he had been a lodger at this house, but he did not infect any other person. The premises again became infected on 4th May, 1902. Between this date and 26th June 17 cases occurred amongst the inmates. The source of infection could not be obtained, as no definite particulars of the patients could be ascertained, as they were all removed from public institutions except one, who was removed from his workplace. In no case could the occupation or place of occupation of the patient be obtained. These persons did not seek medical advice when feeling unwell; it was not until the rashes appeared and the nature of the cases could no longer be concealed that medical treatment was sought under pressure from the superintendent of the house. There was only one member of the staff of the establishment who refused revaccination; he contracted the disease and died before removal to hospital. A young woman living in the same house as the last patient also contracted the infection. The owners ultimately decided to enforce vaccination and revaccination of the lodgers, and those that refused to undergo the operation were not admitted to the house. When this was done small-pox disappeared from the premises. Altogether 17 males and 1 female were attacked in this group. (4) The I)— W— Family Group.—Two members of this family residing at E— Street were certified as suffering from small-pox on 15th November, and 35 they had come from an infected house in Westminster on 1st November, where 5 other cases had occurred; 4 relatives of this family living in M — Mews became infected and were removed to hospital. J— L —, a greengrocer working in these Mews and residing at S — Street, contracted the disease; this patient was the link that illustrated how the disease may be spread from one family to another, although total strangers to each other. S— L—, sister of the above J— L—, was removed from the same address as her brother. D — L—, an unvaccinated child, and nephew of J— L—, who had been staying with its grandparents and uncle, became infected and was returned to its parents at 24, C— Grove before the rash appeared, and its father became infected ; a sister-in-law of the last patient living at the next house, 22, C — Grove, became infected, and also persons named D— G -, father and son, living on the first floor in the same house. After these last two patients had been removed to hospital the wife, E— G —, and an infant three weeks old left this address and went to live at B — H— Yard, where the baby died of small-pox and the mother was removed to hospital. R— G—, a sister-in-law of the last patient, residing at E— Street, became infected, so did also C— M—, residing at A— Street, who is also a sister-inlaw of E— G— and nursed her during her confinement at 22, C— Grove. M — L—, who also visited the latter premises, was removed from Islington. 22, C— Grove became again infected when A— G—, brother of the first patient, D — G —, was removed to hospital. The last patient in this group was a child 13 months old, un vaccinated, daughter of the above C— M— and niece of D— G—, of 22, C— Grove. Not any of these patients would be revaccinated or allow their children to undergo the operation. The infection lasted over a period from 1st November, 1901, to 20th March, 1902, and comprised 24 cases, 7 of which were males, 10 females, and 7 children under ten. (5) The R— S— Public House Group.—F — B— of E— Road was removed to hospital on November 1st He was a customer at the above public house, from where 3 cases were subsequently removed. Twelve other cases were traced as having taken the infection directly or indirectly from this house. Six males, 8 females, and 2 children became infected in this group. The infection extended over a period from November 1st to December 28th, 1901. (6) The Smallpox Hotpital Group.—Owing to the want of accommodation during the recent small-pox epidemic, the Metropolitan Asylums Board decided to build additional hospitals at Long Reach, Darenth. The work was let out to various contractors whose employees were the means of carrying the infection to various parts of London and the Suburbs. The first case traceable to this source occurred in St. Pancras on January 29th, 1902, and the last on May 7th. 36 Twenty-five persons were directly or indirectly infected, consisting of 15 men, 7 of whom had been working at the hospitals, 9 women, (1, whose husband brought the infection home and was not himself attacked), and 1 child. There were 15 different families in this group. SMALL-POX IN ST. PANCRAS.

At the commencement of the epidemic, in June, July, and August, 1901, if reference be made to the memoranda of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, it will be found that the principal local outbreaks at that time were due to the mistaking of modified small-pox for chicken-pox. Before and since, also, there have been numerous instances. If the memoranda published by the Metropolitan Asylums Board be referred to for a number of years past it will be quite frequently found that the small outbreaks in London have been either due to, or aggravated by, the mistaking of small-pox for chicken-pox. At the beginning of the outbreak of small-pox in St. Pancras the very first case was a female laundry hand (a sorter of dirty linen), who was regarded ar.d treated as suffering from chicken-pox. This girl gave the disease to her two sisters, to a child next door, and to others. The child next door was also regarded as suffering from chicken-pox, was so treated, and died after giving the disease to six other members of the family living in other parts of London, to seven other persons in the same house, and to some twenty others in the same street. Many other examples can be cited of small-pox mistaken for chicken-pox with the most disastrous results; in fact, modified small-pox will always be liable to be so mistaken, and it is a strong argument in favour of re-vaccination, became, after primary vaccination in infancy young adults tend to have a very mild and modified form of small-pox often mistaken for chicken-pox. In "Public Health" for September, 1902, there is an interesting paper on "An examination of the blood as an aid in the diagnosis of Small-pox," by Dr. H. Roger, of Paris, and he says, "One disease alone gives similar results, that is chicken-pox. This is not surprising, for chicken-pox seems to depend upon a similar germ to that of small-pox." It has been proved over and over again that the two diseases are not the same and are not convertible, but there is a remarkable parallelism between the two complaints. They appear to prefer to attack unprotected persons at the same age, at the same season of the year, and under the same meteorological conditions. My opinion is that it is not necessary that chicken-pox should be a notifiable disease when small-pox is absent, but that immediately upon the appearance of small-pox, chicken-pox should be made notifiable as one of the protective measures against the more fatal disease. The procedure in dealing with chicken-pox in St. Pancras has been as follows:—When a case of chicken-pox is notified or becomes known, if it is not medically certified, it is referred to a medical referee, who certifies or not accordingly; when it has been medically certified, inquiry is made by letter as to vaccination or revaccination. If the certificate relates to a person under ten years of age, a copy is sent to the Vaccination Officer, inquiring as to the vaccination; and if over ten years of age, to the medical practitioner, as to revaccination. The number over ten years of age is very few (7 or 8 per cent. only) compared with those under, and as it is extremely rare for a person efficiently vaccinated in infancy to be attacked by small-pox under ten years of age, it follows that a statement that the patient has been efficiently vaccinated confirms the dagnosis of chicken-pox almost to a certainty. In the case of adults successfully revaccinated within ten years, it also confirms the diagnosis. 51 The number of cases of chicken-pox unknown to school-teachers is found to be about 88 per cent. of the number known to medical practitioners; and of the total number of cases made known to the Sanitary Authority, only about 14 per cent. do not obtain medical advice, these percentages being the result of experience in St. Pancras. When doubtful cases came to be referred to medical referees, the second medical opinion greatly reduced the chances of mistaken diagnosis, on the one hand saving households from exposure to infection through small-pox being mistaken for chicken-pox, and on the other saving many patients from a long and tedious ambulance journey, with risk of infection through chicken-pox being mistaken for small-pox. Medical referees do not protect persons other than medical men from regarding modified small-pox as chicken-pox; but the fear of prosecution leads to the notification of chicken-pox not medically attended, and enables proper means to be promptly adopted for ascertaining its true nature. Hence the notification of chicken-pox when small-pox is prevalent is of great value in insuring that the utmost care is taken by patients, or the parents and guardians of patients, as well as by medical attendants, to make as sure as human skill can that every case of small-pox is discovered and dealt with promptly. The number of cases of chicken-pox notified week by week during the epidemic of small-pox, and the ages of patients, is stated in the tables under the head of small-pox above. DIPHTHERIA ANTITOXIN. A circular letter, asking whether Diphtheria Antitoxin is kept for sale, and if so, at what hours it is procurable and in what strengths, quantities and prices, was sent to all the Pharmaceutical Chemists in St. Pancras and certain agents and producers of Antitoxin outside St. Pancras, in the City, West Centre, and West End. From the replies it appears that eleven Pharmaceutical Chemists in different parts of St. Puncras keep Antitoxin in stock, obtainable at almost any hour, that five Pharmaceutical Chemists who do not keep it in stock are prepared to obtain it at short notice, and in all probability the majority of the fifty or more Pharmaceutical Chemists in St. Pancras will be prepared to obtain it at short notice for any medical man who gives an order. With regard to the replies from outside St. Pancras, three are original makers, one is an agent for a Continental maker, one for an American maker, and one for a London Institution. Diphtheria Antitoxin may be used as a curative agent in the case of a patient purposely detained at a home for nursing or unable to be admitted to hospital on account of lack of a bed. The danger of either of these events is that other persons, especially children, in the house may become infected and then it may be advisable to inoculate the healthy children as a precaution to prevent the disease, and Diphtheria Antitoxin may then be regarded as a preventive, the duration of its efficacy being reported to be about three weeks, according to the experience of the Children's Hospitals in Paris. For curative purposes from 1,000 to 4,000 Behring units of potency may be inoculated at a dose, the usual number being 2,000 units in 5 cubic centimetres 52 of serum, sold in hermetically sealed tubes or flasks at 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. each. For prophylactic or preventive purposes three quarters, a half, or a quarter of the number of units are used. The question is whether Diphtheria Antitoxin is to be distributed gratuitously ? DISEASE AND FOOD. In Part V. (Food) will be found some account of the connection of food with disease under the heads of Enteric Fever and Shellfish, Diarrhoea and Milk, and Ptomaine Poisoning and Pork Pies. § 2.—ISOLATION.

This point arises particularly when the nature of the disease is not diagnosed until the third week has been reached. In such cases the distance to the hospital is commonly supposed to be an important element in the risk of haemorrhage or of perforation of the intestine involved in removal. Dr. Brownlee has tabulated the number of cases of enteric fever occurring in patients aged 10 years and upwards who have been removed from each mile zone to Belvedere Fever Hospital since the introduction of pneumatic-tyred ambulances, and the corresponding fatality. The numbers in each of the first four zones varied from 441 to 921, a sufficient number to eliminate mistakes due to accidental causes of variation. In patients admitted from a distance under one mile, the fatality was 21.7 per cent., in patients admitted from a distance of one to two miles it was 20.3 per cent., from a distance of two to three miles 21.3 per cent., and from a distance of three to four miles it was 21.1 per cent. In other words, the distance from which the patients were removed made no difference, so far as the prospects of recovery were concerned. This is a valuable result, and it ought to remove prejudices against the removal of enteric patients who cannot be safely and efficiently nursed at home. Dr. Brownlee has also investigated the influence of date of removal on the prospects of the patient. His conclusion is that, "though the death-rate among the cases removed to hospital in the third week exceeds that of those removed in the first and second, yet that result is just as likely to be due to the want of attention received during the earlier stage of the fever, where there is often great lack of skill and knowledge of nursing." And it may be added that, as there is great danger of other members of the family becoming infected where there is any lack of skill or knowledge in nursing an enteric fever patient, removal to hospital is strongly indicated. § 3.—DISINFECTION.

Upon the recommendation of the Health Committee, the late Vestry resolved on the 21st December, 1898, that the Board of Guardians be asked to carry out the provisions of the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897. The principal provisions of the Act are:—Sec. 1.—On and after the passing of this Act, any Local Authority shall have the power, when in their discretion they shall see fit, to permit any person who shall apply to the said Authority on the ground that he is infected with vermin to have the use, free of charge, of the apparatus (if any) which the Authority possess for cleansing the person and his clothing from vermin. The use of such apparatus shall not be considered to be parochial relief or charitable allowance to the person using the same, or to the parent of such person, and no such person or parent shall by reason thereof be deprived of any right or privilege, or be subject to any disqualification or disability. Local Authorities may expend any reasonable sum on buildings, appliances, and attendants that may be required for the carrying out of this Act, and any expenses for these purposes may be defrayed out of any rate or fund applicable by the Authority for general sanitary purposes or for the relief of the poor. Sec.2.—In this Act, "Local Authority" means, in England, the Council of any County Borough, the District Council of any District, any Board of Guardians, and, in the County of London, any Sanitary Authority as defined in the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Upon inquiry I was informed that applicants at the Workhouse gate were referred to the Relieving Officers, and that since 1898 there had been four or five such applicants. In order to compare results, I also made enquiries in Marylehone, and received the following information:—A bath-house and disinfector were erected adjoining the family shelter and stone-yard between Capland Street and Grove Road, St. John's Wood, at the commencement of 1898, and the number of persons who have taken baths and their clothes disinfected has been 3,306 in 1898 (10 months), 4,340 in 1899, 3,432 in 1900, 4,282 in 1901, and 4,351 in 1902 (to the 15th December). Of these the Salvation Army Shelter in Burne Street provided in each of the above years, 3,079, 4,084, 3,168, 3,882, and 3,737 men, the Shaftesbury Institute in Harrow Street provided 5, 0, 31, 142, and 274 women, and from the common lodging houses came 222, 256, 233, 258, and 274 men. The men and women that came were all described as in an unfit condition to go to the public baths. In St. Pancras there is no Salvation Army Shelter or Shaftesbury Institute, but there is a larger common lodging house population than in Marylebone, frequenting the parks and public places equally as much. I recommended— 1.—That baths be placed in the building adjoining the Disinfecting Station, and that verminous and uncleanly persons, inadmissible to the public baths, be admitted to the use of them whilst their clothes are being disinfected. 56 2.—That a placard be drafted and printed on the lines of this recommendation and be sent to be posted in the common lodging houses, Rowton Houses, and similar dwelling places; in the Public Baths, Public Conveniences, and other places under the control of the Borough Council; and in the various buildings under the control of the Guardians, the Out-patient Departments of Hospitals, the Police Stations, and such other places as may appear fit. Family Shelter.—The following Table gives for the year the dates of admission, the number of families, of males, females, and children, the place from whence they came, and the disease after which disinfection was required, and for which the Shelter was sought:— Date. 1901. Adults. Children under 10. Dwelling Place. District. Disease. Length of Stay. (Days.) Males. Females. Shelter devoted to cleansing and disinfection of contacts. The total number of persons cleansed and disinfected during the year was 684. § 4. VACCINATION.

The following is the Special Inspector's Report:— St. Pancras Town Hall, 9th March, 1903. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to submit my report for the year 1902. Small-pox. During the recent small-pox epidemic I investigated 480 certified cases of small-pox. It was not found necessary to obtain a magistrate's order to compulsory remove a small-pox patient to hospital, the relatives and friends being only too anxious for prompt removal. Upon the receipt of a notification certificate the case was telephoned to the Metropolitan Asylums Board for removal, and the disinfectors were instructed, and sometimes arrived at the premises at the same time as the ambulance nurse. I experienced considerable difficulty in getting the bodies of small-pox patients who died at home removed to the infectious disease mortuary, undertakers not caring about the work, and the difficulty was increased tenfold when it became known that two assisfant undertakers had been removed to hospital suffering from small-pox after removing an infected body. There were two cases in which police court proceedings were taken under Sec. 68 P. H. (L.) A. 1891 "for wilful exposure in a public place while suffering from small-pox." The maximum penalty of £5 was inflicted in each case. One defendant had been suffering from small-pox for some two or three weeks, during which time he had been following the calling of a firewood seller. It was not until he had infected his wife and child that the nature of his complaint was discovered, and while being aware of his infectious condition he walked about the public streets and visited public houses in the Borough before he was conveyed to hospital. The other defendant walked from Highgate to Deptford with the doctor's certificate in his pocket certifying that he had got small-pox. Luckily such cases us these were rare. Personal Cleansing and Disinfection of Clothing of Small-pox Contacts. Arrangements were made in January to convert the family shelter into a personal cleansing station. From 28th January to 31st July, 1902, 684 contacts were cleansed and had their clothing disinfected. 63 Some persons required a considerable amount of persuasion to undergo the process, but it was satisfactory to note that when one person came from an infected house several other occupants followed upon being told that having a bath was "not so bad after all." Others expressed great surprise when they found that the bath did not consist of anything more elaborate than clean warm water and yellow soap, clean towels, dressing-gown and slippers, while the clothing was being disinfected. A few persons were very indignant when asked to have a bath, especially those who badly needed it. In one case, where two or three generations were living together in an underground room, there were three fatal cases of smallpox. When I pointed out the necessity of personal disinfection to the eldest female of the family, she, with a fierce look in her eye, indignantly exclaimed, "Do you think that I am going to have a bath at my time of life ? "By her appearance she must have been very young when she had the last one. She did not come to the station. As it is, the statute provides for the disinfection of infected premises and articles, but not for infected persons. In one of the largest lodging-houses in the Borough, which nightly accommodates between 600 or 700 lodgers, 17 cases of small-pox occurred, the infection spreading over a period of about eleven weeks. Not one lodger came to the disinfecting station, although nearly all the patients mixed with the other lodgers in the common rooms. The Borough Council provided an ambuiance to convey contacts to the disinfecting station. 197 persons availed themselves of the conveyance, which was found to be most useful to convey children and old people. General Disinfection. At the end of January a new system was brought into operation which enabled the disinfectors to commence their out of door work at 9 a.m., and not attend at the office engaged in clerical work, by this means a considerable amount of time has been saved and the work expedited. 46,634 articles of bedding, clothing, &c., were disinfected by steam in 715 batches during a period of 292 days. 1528 articles were destroyed by fire with the owners' consent. It speaks well for the manner in which the disinfectors do their work when it is taken into consideration that a claim for damaged articles is of very rare occurrence. An additional steam disinfector was fixed and a new van provided. Stripping and Cleansing of Rooms. A great improvement has taken place in the stripping and cleansing of rooms after infectious disease, the introduction of a default contractor has had a salutary effect, the work being executed with greater care the day after fumigation. 164 I append a table shewing the number of rooms fumigated, stripped, and cleansed. Disease. Number of Rooms Fumigated. Number of Rooms Stripped and Cleansed. Small-pox 328 cubicles, 1 omnibus, and 368 rooms 328 cubicles, 383 rooms, Scarlet Fever 4 cubicles and 1067 rooms 4 cubicles and 1063 rooms. Diphtheria 723 rooms 739 rooms. Membranous Group 9 „ 9 „ Total 332 cubicles, 2185 rooms, 1 omnibus 332 cubicles, 2194 rooms. Registered Tenement Homes. 982 houses Were added to the register, bringing the total up to 1270, the majority of which are in the Southern Divisions of this Borough. 1761 inspections and 4357 re-inspections were made of these premises. A vast improvement has been made in the condition of these houses by enforcing the Bylaws, the rooms and passages being periodically cleansed, and the premises generally being put into a wholesome condition. That good work has been done by the Tenement House Inspectors is demonstrated by the fact that two Inspectors were specially instructed to visit Registered Tenement Houses between the hours of 4 and 8.30 a.m., and made 1140 inspections, and discovered a comparatively small number of cases of excessive overcrowding. On comparing the early morning inspector's return of occupants they actually saw on the premises with the return made out by the inspector who measured the premises prior to being placed on the Register, it is seen that overcrowding was abated upon the primary inspection of the premises in most cases. It is an occasional occurrence for an inspector serving a notice for the abatement of overcrowding to come across the displaced family overcrowding at another premises, only to be turned out again. By periodical inspection these are dispersed amongst the better class of workers and gradually improve in their habits. Inscribed Dwellings. There are 186 dwellings inscribed on the register for periodical inspection, to which 215 inspections were made. These consist of dwellings to which the Tenement House By-laws do not apply by being occupied by members of not more than one family, such as stable dwellings and some blocks of self-contained dwellings, 65 Underground Booms. From special weekly returns made by the Temporary Inspectors 7474 basement rooms were measured up and particulars taken of occupation, use, &c.; this number practically includes all the basement dwelling rooms in tenement houses in the Borough. The enquiries extended over a period from November, 1901, to June, 1902, as the occupation of these rooms is constantly changing; some of those rooms that were illegally occupied at the time of enquiry may be legally occupied, or unoccupied now. I append a table showing the number of streets and houses where inquiries were made, also the number and use of the rooms, approximately:— Number of Streets. Number of Houses. Number of basement rooms. Occupied for sleeping. Occupied for other purposes. Unoccupied. Occupied for sleeping. Illegally so occupied. Legally so occupied. 129 4480 7474 2324 1077 1247 4615 535 Smoke Shafts. There are 215 smoke shafts on the register requiring periodical observation. Under the present mode of smoke inspection the shafts attached to bakehouses escape observation. The ordinary time of observation is between 10.30 a.m. and 5.30 p.m., during which time very little baking is done. The smoke problem in St. Pancras will always be a difficult one to deal with owing to the number of railways and railway sidings in the Borough. I am, &c., W. G. Auger. 66 § 2.

Census, 1901. 68 ATMOSPHERE. We live at the bottom of an ocean of air and at certain spots on this bottom we crowd together in towns and cities. A city discharges its emanations into this ocean, and from this ocean at the same spot a city takes its air supply. The rate of dilution by diffusion is very slow and the rate of purification by vegetation is slower still, so that the air of the cleanest of cities is impure, and pollution rapidly accumulates until reduced mechanically by high winds and heavy rainfalls. The grossest forms of pollution of the air of cities are dust and smoke, and in addition the effluvia of various industrial and trade processes. Smoke.—Dealing for the moment with smoke, the main sources from whence it issues are trade premises, locomotives, and dwelling houses, but the last do not come under the ban of the law controlling atmospheric pollution. With regard to trade premises, the chimney shafts in St. Pancras are now kept under more frequent observation, and notices are being more frequently served to abate the production of smoke. Smoke is not only deleterious to the common air supply, but also a wasteful consumption of fuel and a loss to the producer. Much money would be saved if it were better understood that unconsumed carbon (smoke) is waste of fuel and waste of heat. With regard to locomotives, St. Pancras is provided with a large amount of open space by the railway Companies, but this open space grows no vegetation to assist in purifying the air. On the contrary, it contributes considerably towards polluting it with smoke and fine ash from locomotive engines. For the better understanding of the powers of the Council, the enactments dealing with smoke are set out below:— SMOKE. Public Health [London) Act, 1891. 24.—(a) Any fireplace or furnace which does not, as far as practicable, consume the smoke arising from the combustible used therein, and which is used for working engines by steam, or in any mill, factory, dyehouse, brewery, bakehouse, or gaswork, or in any manufacturing or trade process whatsoever ; and (b) Any chimney (not being the chimney of a private dwelling-house) sending forth black smoke in such quantity as to be a nuisance; shall be nuisances liable to be dealt with summarily under this Act, and the provisions of this Act relating to those nuisances shall apply accordingly: Provided that the Court, hearing a complaint against a person in respect of a nuisance arising from a fireplace or furnace which does not consume the smoke arising from the combustible used in such fireplace or furnace, shall hold that no nuisance is created, and dismiss the complaint, if satisfied that such fireplace or furnace is constructed in such manner as to consume as far as practicable, having regard to the nature of the manufacture or trade, all smoke arising therefrom, and that such fireplace or furnace has been carefully attended to by the person having the charge thereof. 69 23,—Furnace and steam vessels to consume their own smoke.— (1) Every furnace employed in the working of engines by steam, and every furnace employed in any public bath or washhouse, or in any mill, factory, printing house, dyehouse, iron foundry, glasshouse, distillery, brewhouse, sugar refinery, bakehouse, gasworks, waterworks, or other buildings used for the purpose of trade or manufacture (although a steam engine be not used or employed therein), shall be constructed so as to consume or burn the smoke arising from such furnace. (2) If any person being the owner or occupier of the premises, or being a foreman or other person employed by such owner or occupier — (a) uses any such furnace which is not constructed so as to consume or burn the smoke arising therefrom ; or (b) so negligently uses any such furnace as that the smoke arising therefrom is not effectually consumed or burnt; or (c) carries on any trade or business which occasions any noxious or offensive effluvia, or otherwise annoys the neighbourhood or inhabitants, without using the best practicable means for preventing or counteracting such effluvia or other annoyance ; such person shall be liable to a fine not exceeding five pounds, and on a second conviction to a fine of ten pounds, and on each subsequent conviction to a fine double the amount of the fine imposed on the last preceding conviction. (3) Every steam engine and furnace used in the working of any steam vessel on the river Thames, either above London Bridge, or plying to and fro between London Bridge and any place on the river Thames westward of the Nore Light, shall be constructed so as to consume or burn the smoke arising from such engine and furnace ; and if any such steam engine or furnace is not so constructed, or being so constucted is wilfully or negligently used so that the smoke arising therefrom is not effectually consumed or burnt, the owner or master of such vessel shall bo liable to a fine not exceeding five pounds, and on a second conviction to a fine of ten pounds, and on every subsequent conviction to a fine of double the amount of the fine imposed on the last preceding conviction. (4) Provided that in this section the words consume or burn the smoke " shall not be held in all cases to mean " consume or burn all the smoke," and the court hearing an information against a person may remit the fine if of that opinion, such person has so constructed his furnace as to consume or burn, as far as possible, all the smoke arising from such furnace, and has carefully attended to the same, and consumed or burned, as far as possible the smoke arising from such furnaee. 70 (5) It shall be the duty of every sanitary authority to enforce the provisions of this section, and an information shall not be laid for the recovery of any fine under this section except under the direction of a sanitary authority. (6) The provisions of this Act with respect to the admission of the sanitary authority into any premises for any purposes in relation to nuisances, and with respect to the giving of information of a nuisance, shall apply in like manner as if they were herein reenacted, and in terms made applicable to this section. (7) This section shall extend to the port of London, and as respects the port shall be enforced by the port sanitary authority. (8) Nothing in this section shall alter or repeal any of the provisions of the City of London Sewers Act, 1851, or of the Whitechapel Improvement Act, 1853. Smoke—Railway Locomotives. The Railway Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845 (8 Vic. Ch. 20.) Section CXIV. Every locomotive Steam Engine to be used on the Railway shall, if it use Coal or other similar Fuel emitting Smoke, be constructed on the principle of consuming, and so as to consume its own Smoke; and if any Engine be not so constructed, the Company or Party using such Engine, shall forfeit Five Pounds for every Day during which such Engine shall be used on the Railway. Section CXLV. Every Penalty or Forfeiture imposed by this or the Special Act, or by any By-law made in pursuance thereof, the Recovery which is not otherwise provided for, may be recovered by summary proceeding before Two Justices, and on complaint being made to any Justice he shall issue a Summons requiring the party complained against to appear before Two Justices at a Time and Place to be named in such Summons, and every such Summons shall be served on the Party offending, either in Person or by leaving the same with some Inmate at his usual Place of Abode ; and upon the Appearance of the Party complained against, or in his Absence, after Proof of the due Service of such Summons, it shall be lawful for any Two Justices to proceed to the hearing of the Complaint, and that although no Information in "Writing or in Print shall have been exhibited before them; and upon Proof of the Offence, either by the Confession of the Party complained against, or upon the Oath of One credible Witness, or more, it shall be lawful for such Justices to convict the Offender, and upon such Conviction to adjudge the Offender to pay the Penalty or Forfeiture incurred, as well as such Costs attending the Conviction as such Justices shall think fit. Section CL. The Justices by whom any such Penalty or Forfeiture shall be imposed may, where the Application thereof is not otherwise provided for, award not more than One Half thereof to the Informer, and shall award the Remainder to the 71 Overseers of the Poor of the Parish in which the Offence shall have been committed, to be applied in aid of the Poor's Rate of such Parish, or if the Place wherein the Offence shall have been committed shall be extra-parochial, then such Justices shall direct such Remainder to be applied in aid of the Poor's Rate of such extra-parochial Place, or, if there shall not be any Poor's Rate therein, in aid of the Poor's Rate of any adjoining Parish or District. Section CLIX. Provided always, and be it enacted, that notwithstanding anything herein or in the special Act, or any Act incorporated therewith, contained every penalty or forfeiture imposed by this or the Special Act or any Act incorporated therewith, or by any byelaw in pursuance thereof, in respect of any offence which shall take place within the metropolitan police district, shall be recovered, enforced, accounted for, and, except where the application thereof is otherwise specially provided for, shall be paid to the receiver of the metropolitan police district, and shall be applied, in the same manner as penalties or forfeitures other than fines upon drunken persons, or upon constables for misconduct, or for assaults upon police constables, are directed to be recovered, enforced, accounted for, paid and applied by an Act passed in the third year of the reign of her present Majesty, intituled " An Act for regulating the police courts in the metropolis" ; and every order or conviction of any of the police magistrates in respect of any such forfeiture or penalty shall be subject to the like appeal, and upon the same terms, as is provided in respect of any order or conviction of any of the said police magistrates by the said last-mentioned Act; and every magistrate by whom any order or conviction shall have been made shall have the same power of binding over the witnesses who shall have been examined, and such witnesses shall be entitled to the same allowance of expenses, as he or they would have had or been entitled to in case the order, conviction, and appeal had been made in pursuance of the provisions of the said last-mentioned Act. The Regulation of Railways Act, 1868 (31 & 32 Vic., Ch. 119). Section 19. Where proceedings are taken against a Company using a locomotive steam engine on a railway on account of the same not consuming its own smoke, then if it appears to the Justices before whom the complaint is heard that the engine is constructed on the principle of consuming its own smoke, but that it failed to consume its own smoke, as far as practicable, at the time charged in the complaint through the default of the Company, or of any servant in the employment of the Company, such Company shall be deemed guilty of an offence under the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, Section 114. Section 40. Every penalty imposed by this Act shall be recovered and applied in the same manner as penalties imposed by the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, and the Railways Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act, 1845 (as the case may require), are for the time being recoverable and applicable. Effluvia.— There are only two places in which trades classed statutorily as "noxious trades" are carried on in St. Pancras, but there are numerous places in which fish frying, rag and bone storing, and smoke curing are carried on, 72 which not only, from time to time, are definite nuisances to adjoining residents, but continuously add their quota, small or large, to the pollution of the atmosphere. The powers dealing with these are contained in the following enactments:— Effluvia and Offensive Trades, Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Section 19. — Prohibition and regulation of establishing anew certain offensive businesses, and by-laws as to offensiveibusinesses. (1) If any person— (a) establishes anew the following businesses, or any of them; that is to say, the business of blood boiler, bone boiler, manure manufacturer, soap boiler, tallow melter, or knacker; or (b) establishes anew, without the sanction of the County Council, the following businesses, or any of them; that is to say, the business of fellmonger, tripe boiler, slaughterer of cattle or horses, or any other business which the County Council may declare, by order confirmed by the Local Government Board and published in the " London Gazette," to be an offensive business, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds in respect of the establishment thereof, and any person carrying on the same when established shall be liable to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds for every day during which he so carries on the same : (2) Provided that this enactment shall not render any person liable to a fine for establishing anew, with the sanction of the County Council, or carrying on, the business of soap boiler, if and as long as that business is a business in which tallow or any animal fat or oil other than olien is not used by admixture with alkali for the production of soap. (3) The County Council shall give their sanction by order, but, at least fourteen days before making any such older, shall make public the application for it, by serving on the sanitary authority within whose district the premises on which the business is proposed to be established are situate, and by advertising, notice of the application and of the time and place at which they will be willing to hear all persons objecting to the order, and by causing a copy of the notice to be fixed in a conspicuous part of the said premises ; and they shall consider any objections made at that time and place, and shall grant or withhold their sanction as they think expedient. (4) The County Council may make by-laws for regulating the conduct of any businesses specified in this section, which are for the time being lawfully carried on in London, and the structure of the premises on which any such business is being carried on, and the mode in which the said application is to be made. (5) Any such by-law may empower a petty sessional court by summary order to deprive any person, either temporarily or permanently, of the right of carrying on any business to which such by-law relates, as a punishment for breaking the same, and any person disobeying such order shall be liable to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds for every day during which such disobedience continues. (6) Any sanitary authority or person aggrieved by any proposed by-law under this section, or by any proposed alteration or repeal of a by-law, may forward notice of his objection to the Local Government Board, who shall consider the same. (7) There shall be charged for an order of the County Council under this section, and carried to the county fund, such fee, not exceeding forty shillings, as the County Council may fix. (8) For the purposes of this section a business shall be deemed to be established anew not only if it is established newly, but also if it is removed from any one set of premises to any other premises, or if it is renewed on the same set of premises after having been discontinued for a period of nine months or upwards, or of any premises on which it is for the time being carried on are enlarged without the sanction of the County Council; but a business shall not be deemed to be established anew on any premises by reason only that the ownership of such premises is wholly or partially changed, or that the building in which it is established having been wholly or partially pulled down or burnt down has been reconstructed without any extension of its area. (9) Nothing in this section shall render an order of the County Council necessary to authorise the slaughter of cattle at the Metropolitan Cattle Market, or at the cattle market at Deptford, or shall authorise the making of by-laws affecting either of those markets or the slaughter houses erected thereat either before or after the commencement of this Act. (10) In the application of this section to the City of London, the Commissioners of Sewers shall be substituted for the County Council and the consolidated rate for the county fund. Section 21.—Duty of Sanitary Authority to complain to Justice of nuisance arising from offensive trade:— (1) Where any manufactory, building, or premises used for any trade, business, process, or manufacture, causing effluvia, is certified to the Sanitary Authority by their Medical Officer of Health, or by any two legally qualified medical practitioners, or by any ten inhabitants of the district of such authority, to be a nuisance or injurious to the health of any of the inhabitants of the district, such authority shall make a complaint, and if it appears to the Petty Sessional Court hearing the complaint that the trade, business, process or manufacture carried on by the person complained of is a nuisance, or causes any effluvia which is a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to the health of any of the inhabitants of the district, then, unless it is shown that such person has used the best practicable means for abating the nuisance, or preventing or counteracting the effluvia, the person so 74 offending (being the owner or occupier of the premises, or being a foreman or other person employed by such owner or occupier) shall be liable to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds. (2) Provided that the court may suspend its final determination on condition that the person complained of undertakes to adopt, within a reasonable time, such means as the Court may deem practicable, and order to be carried into effect, for abating the nuisance, or mitigating or preventing the injurious effects of the effluvia. (3) The Sanitary Authority may, if they think fit, on such certificate as in this Section mentioned, cause to be taken any proceedings in the High Court against any person in respect of the matters alleged in such certificate. (4) The Sanitary Authority may take proceedings under this Section in respect of a manufactory, building or premises situate without their district, so, however that the summary proceedings shall be had before a Court having jurisdiction in the district where the manufactory, building, or premises are situate. (5) Section one hundred and fifteen of the Public Health Act, 1875 (set out in the first Schedule to this Act), shall continue to extend to London, with the substitution of a Sanitary Authority under this Act for a Nuisance Authority mentioned in the said Section, and any reference in that Section to a nuisance in the Metropolis or to any building, manufactory, or place in the Metropolis which is injurious to health, shall include any nuisance within the meaning of this Act, and any manufactory, building, or place which is dangerous to health. Section 23.—Furnaces and steam vessels to consume their own smoke:— (2) If any person, being the owner or occupier of the premises, or being a foreman or other person employed by such owner or occupier— (e) carries on any trade or business which occasions any noxious or offensive effluvia, or otherwise annoys the neighbourhood or inhabitants, without using the best practicable means for preventing or counteracting such effluvia or other annoyance; such person shall be liable to a fine not exceeding five pounds, and on a second conviction to a fine of ten pounds, and on each subsequent conviction to a fine double the amount of the fine imposed on the last preceding conviction. Section 2.—What nuisances may be abated summarily :— (1) For the purposes of this Act,— (a) Any premises in such a state as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health; 75 (d) Any accumulation or deposit which is a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health ; shall be nuisances liable to be dealt with summarily under this Act. (2) Provided that— (i) Any accumulation or deposit necessary for the effectual carrying on of any business or manufacture shall not be punishable as a nuisance under this Section, if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the accumulation or deposit has not been kept longer than is necessary for the purposes of the business or manufacture, and that the best available means have been taken for preventing injury thereby to the public health ; These various modes of pollution of the atmosphere have now been placed under the control of the Special Inspector, who is paying particular attention to them, and from whose observations it is to be hoped the results at the end of another year will be good. The preceding enactments have been set out for the guidance of the procedure of the Committee and the Department. § 3. DWELLINGS. House-to-House Inquiries and Inspections.—For the purpose of ascertaining the mode of occupation and subletting, 91 inquiries were made from house to house in tenemented streets. For the purpose of discovering underground dwellings, inspections in 131 streets and 4,672 houses were made from house to house in tenement streets with basements below ground level. Registered Tenement Houses. — During the year 386 tenement houses were measured for registration, and at the end of the year 1,270 houses were upon the Register; 1,761 periodical half-yearly inspections of these houses were made, 4,357 re-inspections after the service of notices. Also 186 dwellings were entered in the Register of inscribed dwellings, of which 29 were inspected. Underground Dwellings.—On the Register are 36 underground dwellings ordered to be closed. Reports upon a large number of underground dwellings are being prepared for the consideration of the Public Health Committee. Registered Common Lodging Houses.—In Part VI. (headed Legislation) will be found quoted the new clauses as to Common Lodging Houses in the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902 (2 Edw. VII.. Ch. clxxiii.). Canal Boat Dwellings. — During the year, to the 31 wharves, the Canal, and canal boats 245 visits were paid. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES: ACTS. Part I. Area No. 1, Somers Town. 1 (a)—Church way Scheme.—In continuation of the previous Annual Report on this subject, the London County Council have completed the three blocks of 76 buildings in Church way, named respectively, Wellesley, Somerset, and Seymour Buildings, and the buildings are fully occupied. The fine new roadway of Church way unfortunately still awaits the removal of the houses 146, 148, and 150, Euston Road, for the purpose of opening the new thoroughfare into Euston Road. When this is carried through this great improvement in the heart of Somers Town will be complete. Part II. Area No. 1, Somers Town — continued. 1 (b)—Part of Area—West of Chalton Street and North of Drummond Street. No scheme was made, but the houses were dealt with individually some years since. 1 (e)—Part of Area—East of Chalton Street.— 1 (ci) Chapel Grove Scheme.—In continuation of the previous Annual Report, on the 4th June, 1902, it was resolved to affix the seal of the Council to the Chapel Grove Improvement Scheme, 1898, Amendment Scheme, 1901, as settled by Counsel, and to take all necessary steps to forthwith carry the scheme into effect, and the plans were received, approved, and adopted. On the 24th September, the Amended Scheme, together with that of Eastnor Place, having been duly sealed and notices duly served on all owners, lessees, and occupiers, instructions were given for Petitions to be prepared and lodged with the Local Government Board, for Orders sanctioning the Amended Schemes. 1 (c ii) Eastnor Place Scheme.—In continuation of the previous Annual Report, it was resolved on the 19tli March, that the London County Council having approved of the Amended Scheme, the seal of the Council be affixed to the Eastnor Place Improvement Scheme, 1898, Amendment Scheme, 1901, and that all necessary steps be forthwith taken to carry it into effect. Areas No. 2 and 3. Prospect Terrace and Brantome Place Schemes.—In continuation of the previous Annual Report in reference to these areas and the modified and supplemental schemes, on the 15th January, 1902, your Council resolved—that the Order made by the Local Government Board on the 7th December, 1901, sanctioning the said schemes be published by the Borough Council inserting forthwith a notice thereof in the London Gazette, and by serving notices thereof on all theowners. On the 5th February it was decided to apply to the London County Council for a loan of £24,165 15s. Od. for the purpose of providing dwellings on the Great College Street (supplemental) site in accordance with Article 6 of the Order of the Local Government Board, dated 7th December, 1901, and also for the approval of the London County Council to the proposal of the Borough Council to form a new street through the Brantome Place area, to be known as a continuation of Burton Street. On the 19th March, a communication from the Skinners Company suggesting modifications of the scheme was received and acknowledged, and a Petition was lodged by the Skinners Company against the scheme. On the 19th March, the conditional consent of the London County Council to the erection of dwellings on the Prospect Terrace site was approved by your 77 Borough Council, and the sanction of the London County Council to the formation and laying out of the new street through the Brantome Place area, in continuation of Burton Street, was received, followed by the formal order seven weeks later. On the 7th May, the consents of the London County Council to the erection of the proposed dwellings on the Prospect Terrace and the Brantome Place areas were received. On the 4th June your Council approved the action of the Public Health Committee, who after receiving a copy of the Petition of the Skinners Company from the Local Government Board, instructed your Council's Solicitors to negociate with the Skinners Company for the withdrawal of their Petition against the Order of the 7th December, 1901, as soon as possible. On the 3rd September, an amended application to the London County Council for a loan of £25,436 was approved. On the 15th October, the Council's Solicitor's report was received to the effect that no modification of the scheme could be effected until the Order has been confirmed and that terms must first be arranged with the Skinners Company for the withdrawal of their opposition. On the 26th November, your Committee were informed that the Local Government Board was of opinion that it was impracticable to modify the Order before its confirmation, and suggesting the continuance of negociations with the Skinners Company. On the 25th February, 1903, Mr. T. B. Westacott was appointed to act as Valuer on behalf of the Borough Council in the matter of the Order of the 7th December, 1901, and to forthwith enter into negotiations with the Skinner's Company. Great College Street Site (Supplemental Scheme). — On the 5th February, 1902, your Council resolved that, in accordance with the Order of the Local Government Board of the 7th December, 1901, (which required the Local Authority within two years of the date of the Order to themselves erect dwellings), the Borough Council proceed to erect dwellings for the working class on the Great College Street site, and to apply to the London County Council for a loan of £24,165 15s. for the purpose, in accordance with article 6 of the Older of the Local Government Board of the 7th December, 1901. On March 19th Messrs. Fleetwood, Son, and Eversden were appointed Quantity Surveyors for the proposed buildings; the houses Nos. 2 and 4, Great College Street, were ordered to be vacated, and the Borough Engineer was instructed to remove the Stone Yard, and to clear the whole site. On the 16th April the working drawings, details, and specification for the proposed dwellings were received from the Architect, Mr. Keith D. Young, and sent on to the Quantity Surveyors. On the 4th June, the bills of quantities, the agreement and schedule of conditions of building contract, and form of bond and tender, having been received, it was resolved to advertise for tenders for the erection of the dwellings. On the same date an agreement was settled with Messrs. Mayer, the adjoining occupiers, as to the boundary wall. And on the 25th June, the tender of Messrs. L. Whitehead & Co., of Portland Place North, Clapham Road, was accepted to erect the proposed dwellings for the sum of £17,734. On the 16th July, your Council approved of the appointment of Mr. Owens as Clerk of Works, and of the provision of sums to meet expenditure whilst awaiting the loan from the London County Council. On the 3rd September an amended application to the London County Council for a loan of £25,436 was approved. On the 29th October the Foundation Stone was laid by the Right Worshipful the Mayor, Edmund Barnes, Esq., J.P., and the proposed dwellings named Goldington Buildings. 78 THE SITE VALUES OF INSANITARY AREAS. In order to carry out a scheme of demolition of an insanitary area under the Housing of the Working Classes Act the Public Authority purchases the area and buildings at market value. By Act of Parliament the cleared area is earmarked for the erection of dwellings for the working classes. Any private individual, Company, or Public Authority before erecting such dwellings must estimate the probable rental to be obtained, and the cost of erection and maintenance of such dwellings, in order to arrive at the value at which the area of land so ear-marked can be purchased or credited, In other words, the area is purchased at market value for demolition, and re-purchased or re-credited at ear-marked value for re-housing. The loss by difference between the market value and the ear-marked value of the site may be trifling, considerable, or great, according to the situation of the land. In moderate sized towns and the outskirts of large towns there may be no difference, or so little as not to weigh seriously; in the inner parts of larger cities, and in the outer parts of London, it may be considerable; and in the inner parts of London it may be great, This increase in difference of value increases in direct proportion to the importance of the locality as a centre of national or imperial interests. For instance, the army of workers necessary to cater for the wants of the immense population of travellers from all parts of the world frequenting the centre and middle belt of London. As, in order to protect these interests, Parliament ear-marked insanitary areas for the purpose of housing the workers that minister more especially to these national and imperial visitors and their immediate wants, Parliament should repay out of the imperial funds the difference between the market value and the housing value of insanitary areas. Accordingly, on October 15th, it was resolved— (a) That the Council do present a Petition to Parliament under Seal, either to relieve the Borough Councils of the obligation to use insanitary areas for re-housing schemes, or to repay to those Councils out of Imperial Funds the difference between the market value and the housing value of such areas. (b) That a communication be addressed to the other Borough Councils of the Metropolis calling their attention to the matter, and asking them to take similar action. § 4. SCHOOLS.

Reports of Inspectors.—The following are the reports made to me by the Sanitary Inspectors of Workshops. The man Inspector has been relieved of drainage work, and also of the inspection of effluvia businesses, offensive trades, and smoke shafts, and when the underground bakehouse question is disposed of he will have more time available for completing his Registers of Workshops and Restaurant Kitchens, and for periodical inspections. Public Health Department, Town Hall, St. Pancras, April, 1903. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to submit the following report upon the work done during the year 1902. Bakehouses. —The bakehouses upon the Register have been inspected regularly in April and October and the cleansing done. Many bakehouses had to be inspected twice or oftener before the necessary limewashing was completed. 28 84 notices for cleansing, etc., were served necessitating 43 re-inspections. The sanitary conditions as to cleanliness were generally good. During the latter part of the year I was engaged almost continually in preparing drawings of the underground bakehouses for the Committee in accordance with your instructions. Factories. — 297 Factories are entered in the Register, several of which have been inspected during the year, some upon complaint, and notices served when necessary. Generally the factories visited were in a satisfactory condition. Workshops. — 734 Workshops are entered in the Register, many have been inspected upon complaint and notices served for the abatement of nuisances where such existed. Workplaces.—The inspection of restaurant kitchens was started, and 54 have been entered in the Register as employing male labour; 22 notices were served, mostly for cleansing. The kitchens inspected were generally fairly well ventilated, but the temperature appeared to be high and in excess of that experienced by me in the bakehouses, which are at their maximum working temperature in the very early morning. Smoke Shafts.—There are 214 smoke shafts entered in the Register, of which 49 inspections and 24 re-inspections were made. 72 complaints were received during the year and attended to by inspection, making 145 separate observations of from one to two hours' duration, and 16 intimation notices were served for abatement of nuisance arising from black smoke. Effluvia Businesses and Offensive Trades.—13 inspections and observations were made during the year ; the conditions generally were satisfactory. Generally.—During the early part of the year I was also engaged in superintending drainage works in factory and workshop premises and preparing plans as occasion required. I have also been engaged in the office writing up the various Registers and extracting therefrom information necessary for reports. Your obedient Servant, F. A.

The King Street and the Prince of Wales Baths are supplied with water from their own artesian wells upon the premises. § 7. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. Drain Testing.—Upon receipt of a complaint, notification of infectious disease, or other cause, a Sanitary Inspector tests a drain. He tests it to confirm or disprove a nuisance, the nuisance being the escape of sewer gas into or adjacent to a house. The test employed is a gaseous test, the substance used being judged through the sense of smell by the characteristic odour it produces, e.g., oil of peppermint or other essential oils, or, better still, by the odour and in addition through the sense of sight by the visible fumes given off in the chemical exchange of two substances, e.g., phosphide of calcium and sulphide of allyl which, in the presence of moisture and water, decompose and re-combine with phosphorescent combustion giving off white fumes of phosphide of allyl, having the pungent odour of garlick. Every precaution is taken that the test is not discharged until lodged within the drain, and that the drain is trapped or stopped at every inlet and outlet. If then the fumes of the test escape from within the drain and through the ground and are smelt in or about the house, it is evident that the drain is defective, and the owner is so informed either verbally or by written intimation notice. It is necessary to suggest to owners, magistrates, County Court judges, and others, that Sanitary Inspectors have no more power of seeing through solid ground than ordinary mortals, and that the constant request made that a Sanitary Inspector should state what work is required to be done to a drain that he has not seen is unreasonable. The next step is for the owner to open the ground at the most likely points to ascertain the defects, and whether the Inspector previously give or do not give instructions that the drain must be exposed, it is obvious that the nuisance cannot be abated unless the ground is opened and the drain exposed. 88 Drain Tests.—The following table represents the results of tests applied to drains during the year 1902.

Dairymen.—Section 34 of the Contagious Diseases Animals Act, 1878, under which the General Orders of 1885 and 1886, as to Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops were made by the Privy Council and the Local Government Board respectively, was repealed, as to London, by Sub-section 1 of Section 142 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and was re-enacted as Section 28 of the same Act, but under Sub-section 7 of Section 142 of the same Act, the existing General Orders and Regulations made thereunder passed as unrepealed, and to be read as if the corresponding provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 28, were mentioned therein or referred to, instead of the repealed provisions. Article 6 of the General Order of 1885 requires that all purveyors of milk shall be registered with the Local Authority, and the Local Authority in 1885 and 1886 was the Metropolitan Board of Works, but was displaced in 1889 by the London County Council under the Local Government Act of 1888, and in the Public Health (London) Act of 1891, Section 28 (1) (a) it is expressly enacted that the Local Government Board may order the registration with the London Courtly Council of all dairymen, and by Sub-section 1 of Section 5 of the London Government Act of 1899, the powers of the County Council under Section 28 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, of registering dairymen, were transferred to the Borough Councils. In this manner is the duty placed upon the Borough Council to enforce the registration and to keep and revise a Register of Dairymen, and in addition to enforce by periodical inspection the Regulations with regard to Dairies. By Section 141 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Interpretations, the expression "dairyman" includes any cowkeeper, purveyor of milk, or occupier of a dairy, and the expression "dairy" includes any farm, farmhouse, cowshed, milkstore, milkshop, or other place from which milk is supplied or in which milk is kept for the purpose of sale. Dairies.—By Section 6 (4) of the London Government Act, 1899, it is enacted that it shall be the duty of the Borough Council to enforce within their Borough the bye-laws and regulations for the time being in force with respect to dairies and milk, and with respect to slaughterhouses, knackers' yards, and offensive businesses. There are not any bye-laws in force with respect to dairies and milk, but it is the duty of the Borough Council to enforce the existing regulations of the London County Council, which were originally framed by the Metropolitan Board of Works and taken over by the London County Council under the Local Government Act of 1888. The following are the statutory Provisions, Orders, Regulations, and Transfers by which this is effected:— A.—Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops.—Section 34 of the Contagious Diseases Animals Act of 1878 (41 & 42 Vic. C. 74). B, —The Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1885. 97 C.—The Regulations as to Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops, made by the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1885. D.—The Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1886. E.—Sub-Section (8) of Section 40 of the Local Government Act of 1888 (51 & 52 Yic. C. 41). F.—Sub-Section (1) of Section 4 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. G.—Article 6 of Duties of Sanitary Inspector in General Order of Local Government Board under Section 108 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. H.—The Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1899. I.—Sub-section (4) of Section 6 of the London Government Act of 1899 (62 and 63 Yic. C. 14). J.—Slaughterhouses and Knackers' Yards.—Sub-section 7, Section 20 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. K. — Offensive Businesses. —Bye-law of the London County Council under 37 and 38 Vic. C. 67. ICE CREAMS. Ice Cream Dealers. —Part VIII. of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902, giving powers to the Borough Council to control the manufacture, sale, or storage of ice creams is quoted in this Annual Report under the head of Legislation, Part VI. The Manufacture.—On account of the occurrence of symptoms of poisoning amongst the telegraph boys at the General Post Office in July, the Medical Officer of Health of the City of London (Dr. Collingridge) made inquiries into the manufacture, sale, and storage of ice creams, and reported fully upon the subject at Michaelmas. His description of the manufacture of ice creams is of such permanent interest that it may with advantage be quoted for the information of your Council and the guidance of your Officers. At the outset it may be stated that, generally speaking, the materials are good in the sense that they are not unfit for food, and certainly their condition is not such as to give rise to the symptoms met with. There are practically four methods of manufacture:— (i) The real ice cream, which cannot be sold at a low price, and which is made simply by mixing cream (with a small proportion of milk), fruit or fruit pulp, and sugar. This mixture is then at once frozen. This form of ice cream was not implicated. (it) Milk is flavoured with fruit or fruit essence and sugar, and has then added to it a small quantity of dissolved gelatine, and at once frozen. In these two processes there is no boiling, and both are frozen immediately after mixture. (Hi) This is the ordinary "ice cream" as vended in shops and in the streets. Milk is boiled, either with or without the addition of some form of starch (generally corn flour), with a certain number of eggs, sugar, and flavourirg. Practically the number of eggs used varies inversely with, the amount of starch, the effect of 98 both being to thicken the mixture; and in some cases the practice has been to at once freeze the mixture; in others, in order to economise the consumption of ice, the heated liquid has been allowed to cool naturally, under conditions to which reference will again be made. (iv) This method of manufacture was only met with in one case. A freezing mixture is bought which contains all the materials in a dry powder, and all that is necessary is to boil a certain quantity of this in milk, and subsequently freeze it. This "ice cream" was found to be wholesome. The important stage of the operation would appear to be that between the boiling and freezing. Professor Klein, in his report, called special attention to the fact that the majority of the specific pathogenic bacilli discovered in several of the samples were of a non-sporing variety, and that, therefore, if originally present in the material, would have been destroyed by boiling, and, if found subsequently, must have gained access to the material while cooling. The subsequent freezing, while it might inhibit such bacillus, would certainly not destroy it, and on ingestion and melting its growth and development would again commence. Now the effect of boiling such a mixture would be to sterilize it to a considerable extent, and destroy all the benign or protective organisms usually present. If, therefore, the material were stored while cooling in dirty and insanitary places, where infective organisms could gain access thereto, such organism, free from all interference of saprophytic bacilli, would be under the most favourable conditions for their rapid multiplication. In other words, the mere fact of the previous sterilization would greatly increase the possibility of danger, provided that the pathogenic organism found an entrance. If this be true, then such ice creams as were stored under improper conditions, and especially those which were exposed thereto for any length of time, would be found especially dangerous. As a matter of fact this was usually found to be the case. MILK AND DIARRHŒA. Infantile Mortality.—Buchan and Mitchell demonstrated that, taking a period extending over thirty years in London, the death curve of both sexes at all ages, and from all causes showed (I) a winter upward curve from a minimum in the middle of October rising to a maximum in December and January, falling more slowly again to a minimum reached in the middle of June; and (2) a summer upward curve commencing in the middle of June, reaching its maximum at the end of July and beginning of August, and falling more slowly to a minimum in the middle of October. This summer Jpyramidal curve is practically confined to the third quarter of the year, the months of July, August and September. 99 These writers further demonstrated that the summer pyramid was entirely due to infantile mortality, and that by eliminating the deaths under one year of age the pyramid of mortality in London in the third quarter of the year entirely disappeared. Infantile Diarrhœa.—The same writers further showed that the summer pyramid of mortality was almost entirely due to bowel complaints. Diarrhœa and Enteritis form the bulk of bowel complaints, and of the cause of death amongst children under one year of age bowel complaints bulk largest. The conclusions are that the excessive number of deaths during the third quarter of the year is due to the deaths of infants, that these infants die of bowel complaints—diarrhceal diseases—and that the primary cause of these seasonal diseases is heat. In what manner does heat act in causing diarrhœal diseases? Briefly, by encouraging the growth of micro-organisms, and quickening the infection and decomposition of food within the bowels after consumption, but commencing in the air before consumption. Improper food, that is, food of a kind or material that should not be given to infants, exerts its influence more or less all the year round, but only produces fatal diarrhœal disease on a larger scale during the third quarter of the year. Improper kind of food, therefore, is but of secondary influence as a predisposing cause, aggravating the effects of food infected with the causative organisms of diarrhœal diseases. This is corroborated by the fact that the number of deaths from diarrhœal diseases during the summer of infants fed directly from the breast, and whose milk is not subject to external pollution, is only a tithe of the number of those fed upon cows' milk (in various forms), which is subject to numerous opportunities of pollution during shorter or longer periods. The contamination is cumulative—the shed, the cow, the hands, the pail, each add their quota; the mixing vessels, the hands again, the churns, the carts, the station depot, the railway vans, the railroad dust, the terminal platform, add something more; the milk dealer's cart, the milkshop, the open counter vessels, the milk cans, the dippers, the hands again, and the dust of the street, complete the mixture. The first question is, How can the contamination of milk be prevented in its passage from the cow to the house? and the second, How can the mother in the home be taught to properly handle and administer the milk when she has obtained it? The answer to the first indicates that a complete revolution in the present primitive mode of milk collection and distribution is necessary; and to the second, that education is required in the feeding of infants as part of the greater knowledge of the rearing of infants and young children. Tuberculous—The only satisfactory method of preventing the distribution of milk containing tubercle bacilli derived from cows with tuberculous udders is for the Board of Agriculture to make the periodical examination of the udders of cows by Veterinary Surgeons obligatory throughout the whole country, and for the Inland Revenue Department to cause imported milk to be examined for the presence of tubercle bacilli. The Life of Tinned Condensed Milk.—Tins of milk are supplied by certain producers unlabelled and unmarked, and the wholesale dealers or middlemen 100 label them with brand names or signs, with or without their own names and addresses, and supply them to retail grocers, milkmen, provision shops, oilshops, general shops, and others. The shopkeepers who sell the tins of milk put by all the tins that have burst in the shop, or have been sold and opened by customers and returned, and at intervals return these tins to the wholesale dealer, and recoup the cost. What becomes of these opened tins of unsound condensed milk? Some shopkeepers can recognize tins of condensed milk when unsound and blown, and blown tins are put aside and returned to the wholesale dealers, and the shopkeepers recoup themselves. What becomes of the blown tins of condensed milk returned into the wholesale dealer's hands? Some shopkeepers cannot or do not recognise unsound milk in blown tins. Hitherto the Inspectors have not made formal seizures of these, but have called the attention of shopkeepers to blown tins in the window or on the shelves or otherwise exposed or deposited for sale, and have obtained surrenders of them with written requests to destroy them as trade refuse.

In September, 1902, at Derby, a serious outbreak of ptomaine poisoning occurred. It was traced to the eating of pork pies, the meat of which had become contaminated in the chopping-house by excretal matter and the large intestines of the animals slaughtered in an adjoining building. The meat was chopped up in a place where the large intestines were being prepared for sale. Some sausages, a polony, and a pork pie bought at the inculpated premises in Derby on the morning of Thursday, 4th September, were brought to London by the daughter A—of a family named B—in J—Street, St. Pancras, and eaten with the following results:— Name.

The following are the Reports of the Food Inspectors:— Public Health Department. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, Herewith I submit my Annual Report for the year ending 31st December, 1902. Market Inspections. —The markets, streets, stalls, Costers' barrows, &c., have been inspected daily; 1,939 inspections, and 13 seizures of articles of unsound food have been made during the year, all of which have been dealt with in accordance with the law. Food Factories.—The food factories in my district have had my special attention; 155 inspections have been made of these premises. I have found them kept in a fairly clean and sanitary condition. A great improvement has taken place since frequent and constant inspections have been made, and a willingness to comply with any suggestions for improvements your Inspector may make. There has not been any cases of unsound or unwholesome food found on any of those premises during the past year. Food and Drugs Adulteration Acts.— 250 samples of food of various kinds have been taken and submitted to the Analyst for analyses; his certificates show 51 samples were adulterated. Licensed Slaughter-houses.—I have made 260 inspections of the slaughterhouses and have found the Bye-laws and Regulations properly observed and the premises clean and in a sanitary condition; the animals slaughtered being free from disease and generally of prime quality. Licensed Cowhouses.—There are seven licensed cowhouses in my district; 96 inspections have been made, the Eye-laws and Regulations have been adhered to and the animals kept clean, and found to be healthy and free from any infectious or contagious disease. Registered Dairies and Milkshops.—I have made 680 inspections of premises registered for the sale of milk; as a rule the utensils have been found clean, and it has not been necessary to report any infringement of the regulations, but I am of opinion that milk is sold at a large number of places which are totally unsuited for such an important article of food to be kept for sale. Legal Proceedings. — I have made 60 attendances at the Police Courts in connection with prosecutions it has been necessary to institute in connection with the discharge of my duties as Food Inspector. I am, Sir, yours obediently, J. Osborne. Borough of St. Pancras. Canal Boats Act. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, During the year ending 31st December, 1902, I have made 245 inspections on the Canal situate in this Borough. Eighty registered dwelling boats have been inspected; the Bye-laws and Regulations have been fairly well observed, only in four cases have I had to report any infringement of the Act. In each instance a letter has been sent to the owners of the boats, calling their attention to the breach of the Regulations, when the matter has been put right without having to resort to any legal proceedings. Yours obediently, J. Osborne, Canal Boats Inspector. Inspector's Office, Town Hall, St. Pancras, To Dr. J. F. J. Sykes, March, 1903. Medical Officer of Health, Dear Sir, I beg to submit to you a report of my work in the Northern and Eastern Divisions of the Borough for the year ended 31st December, 1902. 106 107 Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.—I obtained 250 samples of different articles for analysis by the Public Analyst, of which 49 samples were adulterated, and proceedings were taken in 16 cases. Licensed Slaughter-houses.—I made 212 inspections of the eight private slaughter-houses in the divisions, and saw 590 animals killed and dressed, and such organs as on examination were found to be diseased I had removed by consent of owners under Sub-section 8 of Section 47 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. I append the following table showing the number of animals found to be diseased, nature of disease, how affected and disposed of:— No. Description of Carcase. Disease. How Affected. How Disposed of. 1 Pig Tuberculosis Carcase and Organs Destroyed at Dust Destructor. 5 Oxen Abscess Livers „ „ 1 Ox Abscess Lungs „ „ 1 Ox Flukes Liver „ „ 1 Ox Tuberculosis Liver and Lungs „ „ 1 Ox Echmococcus veterinorum Liver „ „ In addition, I found a few pigs' and sheeps' liver and lungs affected with parasitical diseases; these were also destroyed. In one case only did I find a breach of the By-laws; I served a notice on the owner according to instructions. Licensed Cowhouses.—I paid 246 visits to the nine licensed cowsheds, and found them fairly satisfactory. Milkshops.-I made 647 visits to milkshops, and with a few exceptions found the premises generally satisfactory. During these visits 1 found 45 persons selling milk without being registered in accordance with the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order. Marketing Places. —I made 1,612 inspections of the various market places, including also butchers, pork-butchers, poulterers, fishmongers, greengrocers and fruiterers, and made applications to the magistrates sitting at the police courts to condemn and order to destroy certain unsound foods. The following food was destroyed, in addition to that found at slaughter-houses, but in most cases by request of owners:— 2½ pigs' heads. 3¾lbs. of cherries, lcwt. of mackerel. 3¼cwts. of skate. 36 William pears. 60 bananas. 81bs. plums. Tomatoes and lemons. 108 Tinned Foods.—I visited various places where tinned foods are kept for sale, and found the following goods unsound:— 18 tins of peaches. 3 tins of tomatoes. 156 tins of condensed milk. 473 tins of sardines. 2 tins of salmon, &c. Prepared Foods.—There is only one tripe-boiler who prepares tripe, livers, hearts, and other organs for consumption by domestic animals as well as by man and sells both classes of food in the same shop. I have made inspections from time to time, and always found the above satisfactory. Sausage Makers.—I visited several of these places, and examined the meat in preparation for sausages, and always found it sweet and sound. Meat Extractor.—There is only one place where extract of meat is prepared, which I always found satisfactory. During the month of August, while Mr. Auger was away on annual leave, I was relieved of my district to carry out his duties in regard to disinfection and small-pox. I may mention that since my last report I have obtained the Certificate of the Sanitary Institute, which qualifies me as an Inspector of Meat and other foods. I am, &c., Harry Robt. Child. VI.—LEGISLATION. During the year the following Acts of sanitary and administrative interest to public health were passed:— The Midwives Act, 1902 (2 Edw. VII., Ch. xvii.); an Act to secure the better training of midwives and to regulate their practice. The Cremation Act, 1902 (2 Edw.

To issue and cancel certificates. And generally to do any other act or duty which may be necessary for the due and proper carrying out of the provisions of this Act. Rules framed under this section shall be valid only if approved by the Privy Council: and the Privy Council, before approving any such rules, shall take into consideration any representations which the General Medical Council may make with respect thereto. 8.—Every Council of a County or County Borough throughout England and Wales shall, on the commencement of this Act, be the local supervising authority over midwives within the area of the said County or County Borough. It shall be the duty of the local supervising authority— (1) To exercise general supervision over all midwives practising within their area in accordance with the rules to be laid down under this Act. (2) To investigate charges of malpractice, negligence, or misconduct, on the part of any midwife practising within their area, and should a prima facie case be established, to report the same to the Central Midwives Board. (3) To suspend any midwife from practice, in accordance with the rules under this Act, if such suspension appears necessary in order to prevent the spread of infection. (4) To report at once to the said Board the name of any midwife practising in their area convicted of an offence. 110 (5) During the month of January of each year to supply the Secretary of the Central Midwives Board with the names and addresses of all midwives who, during the preceding year, have notified their intention to practise within their area, and to keep a current copy of the roll of midwives, accessible at all reasonable times for public inspection. (6) To report at once to the Central Midwives Board the death of any midwife or any change in the name or address of any midwife in their area, so that the necessary alteration may be made in the roll. (7) To give due notice of the effect of the Act, so far as practicable, to persons at present using the title of midwife. The local supervising authority may delegate, with or without any restrictions or conditions as they may think fit, any powers or duties conferred or imposed upon them by or in pursuance of this Act, to a committee appointed by them, and consis ing either wholly or partly of members of the Council, and the provisions of sub-sections one and two of section eighty-two of the Local Government Act, 1888, shall apply to every Committee appointed under ihis section and to every Council appointing the same, and women shall be eligible to serve on any such Committees. 9.—A County Council may delegate, with or without any restrictions or conditions as they may think fit, any powers or duties conferred or imposed upon them by or in pursuance of this Act, to any District Council within the area of the County, and the powers and duties so delegated may be exercised by a Committee appointed by such District Council and consisting either wholly or partly of members of the District Council, and women shall be eligible to serve on any such Committee. Any expenses incurred by a District Council in the execution of any powers or duties so delegated shall, to an amount not exceeding such sum as may be prescribed by the County Council, be repaid to such District Council as a debt by the County Council, and any excess above the sum so prescribed shall be borne by the District Council as part of their ordinary expenses. The provisions of this section shall apply to the administrative County of London in like manner as if each Metropolitan Borough were a County District and the Borough Council were the District Council of that district. 10.—Every woman certified under this Act shall before holding herself out as a practising midwife, or commencing to practise as a midwife, in any area, give notice in writing of her intention so to do to the local supervising authority, or to the body to whom for the time being the powers and duties of the local supervising authority shall have been delegated under this Act, and shall give a like notice in the month of January in every year thereafter during which she continues to practice in such area. Such notice shall bo given to the local supervising authority of the area within which such woman usually resides or carries on her practice, and the like notice shall be given to every other local supervising authority or delegated body within whose area such woman at any time practises or acts as a midwife, within forty-eight hours at the latest after she commences so to practise or act. Every such notice shall contain such particulars as may be required by the rules under this Act to secure the identification of the person giving it; and if l11 any woman omits to give the said notices or any of them, or knowingly or wilfully makes or causes or procures any other person to make any false statement in any such notice she shall on summary conviction be liable to a fine not exceeding five pounds. 11.—Any woman who procures or attempts to procure a certificate under this Act by making or producing, or causing to be made or produced, any false and fraudulent declaration, certificate or representation, either in writing or otherwise, shall be guilty of a misdemeanour, and shall on conviction thereof be liable to be imprisoned, with or without hard labour, for any term not exceeding twelve months. 12.—Any person wilfully making or causing to be made any falsification in any matter relating to the roll of midwives shall be guilty of misdemeanour, and shall be liable to be imprisoned with or without hard labour for any term not exceeding twelve months. 13.—Any offences under this Act punishable on summary conviction may be prosecuted by the local supervising authority.

THE CREMATION ACT, 1903. This Act makes all the provisions of the Burial Acts which refer to the provision of a burial ground, applicable also to the provisions of crematoria; it also applies, for similar purposes, the provisions of the Public Health (Interments) Act, 1879. It further enacts that no crematorium shall be constructed nearer than 200 yards to any dwelling house except by consent in writing of the owner, lessee and occupier of such house, nor within 50 yards of any public highway nor in the consecrated part of the burial ground of any burial authority. The regulations as to the maintenance and inspection of the crematoria and all details as to the burning of the body, the disposal of the ashes and a variety of details are to be settled by the Secretary of State. 112 LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1902, [2 EDW. 7, CH. CLXXIII.] Part VIII.—Ice Cream*. 42.—Any person being a manufacturer of or merchant or dealer in ice creams or other similar commodity who within the County— (a) Causes or permits ice creams or any similar commodity to be manufactured, sold, or stored in any cellar, shed, or room in which there is any inlet or opening to a drain, or which is used as a living room or sleeping room; (b) In the manufacture, sale, or storage of any such commodity does any act or thing likely to expose such commodity to infection or contamination or omits to take any proper precaution for the due protection of such commodity from infection or contamination; or (c) Omits on the outbreak of any infectious disease amongst the persons employed in his business, or living or working in, on, or about the premises in or on any part of which any such commodity as aforesaid is manufactured, sold, or stored, to give notice thereof forthwith to the Medical Officer of the Sanitary District in which such business is carried on or such premises are situate; shall be liable for every such offence on conviction in a Court of Summary Jurisdiction to a penalty not exceeding Forty Shillings. 43.—Every itinerant vendor of any such commodity as aforesaid shall, if not himself the manufacturer thereof, exhibit in a legible manner on a conspicuous part of his barrow a notice, stating the name and address of the person from whom he obtains such commodity, and if such vendor is himself the manufacturer of such commodity he shall in the same manner exhibit his own name and address.

(4) If a licence or renewal of a licence be refused upon the ground that the premises are not suitable or suitably equipped for the purposes of a common lodging-house, the magistrate shall have power to appoint a person, being a properly qualified surveyor or architect to examine and report to him upon the condition of such premises and their suitability for the purposes of a common lodginghouse. (5) The costs of any such appeal including the expenses of any such examination and report as aforesaid shall be paid in such manner and by such parties to the appeal as the said magistrate may direct. 51.—From and after the expiration of the period of notice to be given by the Council as aforesaid, no person, unless he shall have applied for and obtained a licence under this part of this Act, shall keep a common lodging-house in the County or receive lodgers therein. 52.—Any person who shall hereafter be desirous of becoming a licensed lodging-house keeper in the County shall be at liberty to make application to the Council in the same manner as if he had at the date of the passing of this Act been a registered common lodging-house keeper, and the provisions of this part of this Act shall apply accordingly. 53. — (1) From and after the passing of this Act, Section 9 of the Common Lodging-Houses Act, 1851, shall cease to be operative or have the effect in the County.

LEGAL DECISIONS. The King v. Jones Removal to Hospital of a person suffering from Small-pox by Order of a Magistrate upon a certificate of a Medical Officer of Health. On the 2nd May, 1902, in the King's Bench Division, Mr. Schultess Young moved for a rule nisi for a certiorari to quash an Order made by Mr. T. F. Jones, a Justice of the Peace for Surrey, under Section 124 of the Public Health Act, 1875, that one, W. C. Quelch, residing with his father, Mr. J. J. Quelch, at Onslow Gardens, Wallington, should be removed to the Small-pox Hospital at Cheam, on the ground that he was suffering from that disease and that there was no proper accommodation at his father's residence. Counsel stated that the patient was 26 years of age, the house was well fitted for his accommodation, there was no one in the house but the patient and his mother and a nurse; and the Magistrate made the Order without notice to Mr. Quelch on a certificate given by Dr. Fegen, Medical Officer of Health for the Rural District of Croydon. Mr. Quelch had obstructed and prevented the execution of the Order and was now summoned for a penalty. There was no evidence of want of proper accommodation. An appeal was pending against the Order. The patient was now well and in Court. If the certificate was on oath there might be evidence of want of proper accommodation. The Lord Chief Justice said there must be no rule in this case as the Magistrate was entitled to act on the certificate of a medical man under Section 124 of the Act, and certiorari did not lie as to the exercise of jurisdiction by Magistrates on a matter in which they had jurisdiction.—(Times, 3rd May, 1902.) 117 Wimbledon Urban District Council v. Hastings. High Court of Justice. King's Bench Division. June 24th 1902. Before Lord Alverstone, L.C.J., Darling and Channell, J.J. Public Health Act, 1875, Sections 91 and 102—Nuisance from Overcrowding— Day School—Right of Entry. A day school is a "house" within the meaning of Section 91 (5) of the Public Health Act, 1875, and a nuisance may arise from overcrowding due to an excessive number of scholars being taught in one room. A Justice, before making an Order to admit the officer of a local authority under Section 102 of the same Act, may receive evidence offered by the occupier of the premises as to whether there is reasonable ground for believing that a nuisance exists. The Order ought also to be confined to the subject matter of the alleged nuisance. This was an appeal by way of a case stated from the Surrey Quarter Sessions, the appellants being the Wimbledon Urban District Council and the respondent being the head-mistress of a high school for girls within the district of the appellants. A complaint was made to the Council that one of the schoolrooms was overcrowded, owing to too many scholars being taught in the room at the same time. An inspector of nuisances visited the school and applied for admission to examine the school, for the purpose of seeing whether the alleged nuisance existed. The respondent refused to grant him admission. A letter from the Clerk produced no better result. An application was then made to the Justices of the Peace for an Order under Section 102 of the Public Health Act, 1875, requiring the respondent to admit the inspector, and upon the oath of the inspector an Order was made requiring the respondent to admit the inspector to the premises. The respondent appealed to the Court of Quarter Sessions, and contended that the Order was bad on several grounds, among others that Section 91 (5) of the Public Health Act, 1875, applied only to dwelling houses and not to day schools, so that there could be no nuisance within that provision, and that scholars were not inmates, and also that the Justices had not reasonable grounds for making the Order The form of the Order was also questioned as being too general, as it did not specify any particular nuisance. The respondent desired to tender evidence to show that the nuisance did not in fact exist, but this evidence the Court of Quarter Sessions declined to hear; but they decided that scholars were not inmates within the meaning of Section 91 (5) of the Public Health Act, 1875, and that therefore no nuisance was alleged to exist. They therefore allowed the appeal, and quashed the Order of the Justices. 118 The words of Section 91 (5) are:—"Any house or part of a house so overcrowded as to be dangerous or injurious to the health of the inmates, whether or not members of the same family." By Section 4 of the same Act it is provided that "In this Act, if not inconsistent with the context, the following words and expressions have the meaning hereinafter respectively assigned to them—that is to say, . . . 'house' includes schools, also factories and other buildings in which]persons are employed." By Section 102 it is enacted that "the Local Authority or any of their officers shall be admitted into any premises for the purpose of examining as to the existence of any nuisance thereon, at any time . . . between the hours of nine in the forenoon and six in the afternoon, or, in a case of nuisance arising in respect of any business, then at any hour when such business is in progress or is usually carried on. ... If admission to premises for any of the purposes of this Section is refused, any Justice, on complaint thereof on oath by any officer of the Local Authority (made after reasonable notice in writing of the intention to make the same has been given to the person having custody of the premises), may, by Order under his hand, require the person having custody of the premises to admit the Local Authority, or their officer, into the premises during the hours aforesaid, and if no person having custody of the premises can be found, the Justices shall, on oath made before him of that fact, by Order under his hand, authorise the Local Authority, or any of their officers, to enter such premises during the hours aforesaid." C. A. Russell, K.C., and Humphreys appeared for the Appellants; Macmorran, K.C., and Daldy for the respondent. The Court allowed the appeal. Alverstone, L.C.J., in giving judgment, said the Court of Quarter Sessions had decided that the Order of the Magistrates was not a proper Order, because it related to a school, and that school was not, in their opinion, a house or part of a house so overcrowded as to be dangerous or injurious to the health of the inmates. Now, the interpretation clause of the Act, Section 4, says that "house" is to include school, and prima facie, when you are dealing with the matter of niusances, there would not seem to be any reason why there should not be the same power of inspection with regard to a school kept for the purpose of boys or girls being received and passing several hours of the day there for the purpose of their education, just in the same way as power is given to go into a private house under certain circumstances in a proper case where the Justice might make the Order for inspection in the private house. Mr. Macmorran contends that must mean dwelling house in the ordinary sense of the word, where people sleep, and he fortifies his argument by referring to Section 6, dealing with factories and the overcrowding of a factory, which would otherwise come within Sub-section (5), and he says that shows that as overcrowding of a factory is mentioned in Sub-section (6), " house " is limited to a dwelling house in this Section. I think the answer to that is that, with regard to factories, the legislature were desirous to bring in other things, and to give a wider scope to the power of the local authority, and they used the words " not kept in a cleanly state, or not ventilated," &c.; and then to avoid it being said that overcrowding was not within the Section, they have to add those words at the end as to overcrowding. We think, therefore, that the particular point upon which the Court of Quarter Sessions held the Order was bad was wrong, and the case must be further dealt with. 119 On the subordinate points we are all of opinion that neither the Justices out of Sessions nor Quarter Sessions have to decide whether there was a nuisance or not, but they may have to consider whether there is reasonable ground for suspecting there is a nuisance, and there is an obvious difference between this case and cases of complaint of want of sanitary appliances or insufficiency of drains, as to which inspection may in many cases be the only way to decide if they are fit or not; but when allegations are based on questions of fact we think it would be going too far to say that the Justices ought not to be allowed to receive evidence as to what was the true state of facts before them on which they purport to act. We think, therefore, that they were entitled to hear evidence to show that the allegation on which a ground for inspection was based was without foundation. We think, further, that the Order ought to be made in reference to the particular subject-matter, and should not give an officer a right to inspect everything. Darling, J., concurred. Channell, J., also concurred, and, as to the question under Section 102, added that the Order is to be made on notice to the party, and therefore it is obvious that the Magistrate must have something else to consider than the mere fact that the officer desires to go. I think the Magistrate is entitled and bound to to see the object for which the officer wants to go, and see if it is a matter that can come within the first part of the Section. Suppose, for instance, that Miss Hastings had said, "It is an entire mistake; I do not keep any school at all. I have no schclars coming to me, and no one in the house at all." It is perfectly clear she would be entitled to give that evidence, and to say: "This is not a school. There are not 400, or 200, or 32, or any other number of scholars. There are in all two or three children of my own or inmates of the house." The object for which the person wants to go is certainly a matter to be inquired into by the Magistrate, and it seems to me that the other party is entitled to offer evidence, not for the purpose of showing that there is no nuisance in fact, but for the purpose of showing there is no object in examining the premises. Note.—It must be added that this ruling does not apply to infectious diseases nor to unsound food, in which cases the Orders of Magistrates are made upon ex parte applications provided that they are accompanied by proper certificates. See Queen v. Davey, M.O.H., Annual Report for 1899, p. 30, and other cases. Humphrey v. Young. Semi-detatched houses, two buildings in separate curtilages and combined drain, a Sewer. This was a case stated by Magistrates for the opinion of the Court upon a question of law arising upon the hearing of a summons against the respondent for refusing to obey a notice served by the appellant, an Inspector of Nuisances for the Borough of Reigate, requiring the respondent to make certain alterations to the drains of Nos. 36 and 38, Somers Road, in that Borough, of which houses the respondent was the owner. The premises in question were a pair of semidetached houses, built, apparently, at the same time, having one continuous roof and divided by a party wall which did not go up through the roof. The 120 premises had always been the subject of a separate letting, and separately assessed and rated in the poor and other rates. The drain or sewer in question was used for the drainage of both houses. The Magistrates found as a fact that the two houses were two separate buildings and not within the same curtilage, and were of opinion, on the authority of "Travis v. Utley" (1894 1 Q.B., 233), that the drain or sewer in question was a sewer within the meaning of the Public Health Act, 1875, vested in the Local Authority, and that the respondent could not be required to alter or amend it. The question for the opinion of the Court was whether the Magistrates, in deciding that the two houses were in fact two buildings, had come to a right decision in law. Mr. It. Bray, K.C., and Mr. 01. Humphreys were for the appellant; Mr. Macmorran, K.C., and Mr. Naldrett for the respondent. Mr. Bray contended that the Magistrates had come to a wrong decision, Mr. Justice Cozens-Hardy had decided, in the case of "Hedley v. Webb" (1901, 2 Ch., 126), that a pair of semi-detached houses constituted one building. That case was an authority binding upon the Magistrates. The Magistrates had not directed their minds to the proper question, as the question was not how the buildings had been dealt with, as by a separate letting or otherwise, but whether the houses were, in fact, one building. It was impossible to say that these houses, built at the same time and being under one continuous roof, were two separate buildings. Mr. Macmorran, on behalf of the respondent, argued that the decision of Mr. Justice Cozens-Hardy in "Hedley v. Webb" left it a question of fact in each case whether or not a pair of semi-detached houses constituted one building. The Magistrates had decided that the houses in question were two separate buildings, and this decision on a question of fact should not be disturbed. The Magistrates were right in deciding that the drain was a sewer. The case of "Travis v. Utley" decided that a drain passing through private ground, but receiving the drainage or more than one building, was a "sewer" within the meaning of the Public Health Act. The Lord Chief Justice, in delivering judgment on Monday, said that it had been argued that a pair of semi-detached houses must be found to be one building, because they were built at the same time and were under one continuous roof. He doubted whether the word "building" in the Public Health Act was intended to have so wide a meaning. Section 4 of the Act said, "Drain means any drain of and used for one building only, or premises within the same curtilage, &c." If it had been intended to deal with the question of structure some more distinct definition would have been given. He thought that it must come to a question of fact in each case. The Magistrates had found as a fact that the houses formed two buildings, and that, therefore, the drain in question was a sewer vested in the public authority. The case of "Travis v. Utley," in which case the structure of the houses was somewhat similar, was an authority for the proposition that each case must stand on its own merits. The decision of Mr. Justice Cozens-Hardy in "Hedley v. Webb" went on many grounds. He was of opinion that it must be a question of fact in each case, and that no general rule could be laid down to the effect that a pair of semi-detached houses must in all cases constitute one building. The decision of the Magistrates could not be disturbed, and the appeal must be dismissed. 121 Mr. Justice Wills and Mr. Justice Channell concurred, and the appeal was dismissed. (Before Mr. Justice Lawrence and a special Jury.) (Times, 7 th November, 1902.) Woodford Urban District Council v. Stark. Meaning of " a Drain or Drains for a House." The meaning of Section 25 of the Public Health Act, 1875, is that a person who erects a house must provide a separate drain for that house. The District Council appealed from a decision of Magistrates who had dismissed two informations against the respondent under Section 25 of the Public Health Act, 1875. The respondent deposited with the Council notice of intention to erect two houses in one block, with a block plan thereof showing a combined drain. The plan was disapproved on the report of the Council's Surveyor, on the ground that the drainage was unsatisfactory, and the Council made an order under the said Section that a separate drain should be provided for each house. The respondent, nevertheless, constructed the combined drain according to the plan. The Council thereupon laid two informations against him—one in respect of each house—for building a house contrary to the provisions of the Section, which provides that it shall not be lawful in an urban district to erect a house unless a covered drain or drains be constructed of such size and materials and at such level and with such fall as on the report of the Surveyor may appear to the Urban Authority to be necessary for the effectual drainage of the house. The Magistrates dismissed the informations, as they were of opinion that the Council had no jurisdiction to order a separate drain, but were confined by the Section to considering only such matters as size, materials, level, and fall. The following cases were cited:—Bradford v. Mayor of Eastbourne (1 C.C.C,. 94), Hedley v. Webb (6 C.C.C., 48), Pilbrow v. St. Leonard, Shoreditch (1895, 1 Q.B., 433), and Matthews v. Strachan (6 C.C.C., 121). Held—That Section 25 meant that there should be a separate drain for each house. Appeal allowed and case sent back to the Magistrates. Decided K.B.D., Lord Alverstone, C.J., Darling and Channell, J.J., March 17th, 1902. [112 L.T., 480; 18 T.L.R., 439.] Kyffin v. Simmons. King's Bench Division. 27th March, 1903. Appeal before the Lord Chief Justice of England (Lord Alverstone), Mr. Justice Wills, and Mr. Justice Channell. A building which is let in separate tenements for dwelling purposes is a house let out in lodgings within the meaning of Section 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. 122 Statement of Case. "The appellant was summoned before me sitting at the Guildhall Justice Room in the City on the said 3rd June, 1902, to answer an information laid by the respondent, the Sanitary Inspector appointed by the Sanitary Authority of the said City, in respect of the following offence, namely, for that he the appellant on the 9th day of May, 1902, in the said City, at No. 13, Shaftesbury Place, Aldersgate Street, E.C., being a house let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, did knowingly cause or suffer a greater number of persons than would admit of the provision of air space required for each to occupy at one time, as a sleeping apartment, a room used exclusively for that purpose contrary to the third By-law made by the Sanitary Authority of the said City, and contrary to the Statute. The By-law in question is as follows:— The landlord of a lodging house or a lodger therein shall not knowingly cause or suffer a greater number of persons than will admit of the provision of 350 cubic feet of free air space for each person of an age exceeding 10 years, and of 175 cubic feet of free air space for each person of an age not exceeding 10 years, to occupy at any one time as a sleeping apartment a room which is used exclusively for that purpose and which is under the control of such landlord, or which has been let to or is occupied by such lodger respectively, as the case may be. A copy of the said By-laws is hereto annexed, numbered 1. On the hearing of the said summons the following facts were proved:—(a) No. 13, Shaftesbury Place is an ordinary six-roomed house, and was not specially constructed to be let in separate tenements. It was rated as one hereditament. It consists of three floors and a basement. It has one common internal staircase and one common front door, which door is always kept open. On each floor there are two rooms, and each floor is separately let to and occupied by a separate family. The ground and first floors have each one door opening on to the staircase. The top floor has a door from each room opening on to the staircase. There is no separate washing or sanitary accommodation for the different floors, but in the basement there is a scullery and washhouse, and in the yard there is a tap and a w.c., all of which are used in common by the tenants of the different floors. A plan of the premises in question is annexed hereto and marked No. 2. (b) The appellant is the landlord of the said premises and lets the different floors therein to different families, all of whom are ordinary weekly tenants and pay rents of from 5s. to 5s. 6d. per week. (c) The first floor was let to one Cornelius Edward Liddington at 5s. 6d. per week and was occupied by him, his wife, his son aged 11, and his three daughters, each under 10 years old. (d) The appellant does not reside on the premises, nor has he any representative there. He attended every week to collect the rents, but beyond that there was no evidence of control over the tenants. He knew the number of people who were sleeping in the back room in question, but until after the date of the alleged offence he took no steps to alter the condition of things by giving the tenant notice to quit or otherwise. It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the said house was not a lodging house within the meaning of the said By-laws, and in support of that contention the case of Weatheritt v. Cantlay (1901), 2 King's Bench, 285, was cited. I, however, decided that the said house was a lodging house within the meaning of the said By-laws, and that the appellant being the landlord thereof had knowingly caused and suffered a greater number of persons than would admit of the provision of air space required for each to occupy at one time as a sleeping apartment a room, to wit, the said back room on the first floor used exclusively 123 for that purpose. On the facts as above stated I held that the room was under the appellant's control within the meaning of the said third By-law. I therefore convicted the appellant, and I fined him £5 and ordered him to pay £2 2s. for costs. The question for the opinion of the Court is—Whether the premises so constructed and let as aforesaid were a lodging-house within the meaning of the said By-laws. If the Court is of that opinion, then my said decision is to stand; if the Court is of the contrary opinion, my said decision is to be quashed, or such other Order is to be made herein as to the Court may seem just." Judgment. The Lord Chief Justice: If this house under the circumstances stated in the case does not fall within the Section, I fail to see what house would fall within the Section. The Magistrate has found as a fact that it is an ordinary six-roomed house with a common staircase, each pair of rooms being occupied by a separate family, and it is within the words " house occupied by members of more than one family "the Magistrate has found that, and whether it is a question of degree or a question of fact makes no difference. He has found it as a fact, and if there was evidence upon which he could so find it we should not upset it. It was conceded that the case of Weatheritt v. Cantlay was contrary to that. I asked Mr. Hinde to read the judgment in that case, which he kindly did, and it seems from that that the test which the Magistrate has applied here is the right test. In that case there were a number of floors containing separate tenements which might be defined to be separate houses, and they did not cease to be separate houses because they were under one common roof. I there used the expression, which I repeat, that if that were not the true test, all blocks of buildings occupied as flats would be places occupied by more than one family and would come within the purview of the Section. I think that is an observation which is entitled to weight. I think that here the Magistrate was perfectly entitled to come to the conclusion that this is a house within Section 94 of the Act. Mr. Justice Wills: I am of the same opinion. I think this is a house, or the Act of Parliament would be of no use. Mr. Justice Channell: I agree on the ground that it is a question of fact. I have a little doubt whether the separate tenements were separate houses, but I think that upon the facts as found the Magistrate was right. Mr. Muir: The appeal is dismissed with costs. The Lord Chief Justice: Yes. Weatherett v. Cantlay. This case was quoted in the Mcdical Officer of Health's Annual Report for 1901, page 96, and the following case (Roots v. Beaumont) is also interesting:— Roots v. Beaumont. Queen's Bench Division. April 6th, 1886. Public Health Act, 1875, Section 90.—By-laws as to Houses let in Lodgings. A local board made by-laws requiring registration, &c., from the landlord of a lodging-house, and defined "lodging-house," to mean "a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family B. let four unfurnished rooms of her house to M. and his family. Held: The Justices were wrong in holding that B. did not come within the meaning of the definition as landlord of a lodging-house. (L.I.J.P., p. 197.) 124 REPORTS OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, 1902.
