To the Right Worshipful the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Islington. Gentlemen, In presenting you with this Report on the health and sanitary condition of your Borough for the year 1906, I am pleased to be able to congratulate you on the very good state of health which it discloses, particularly as coincident with the close of the year, I completed as Medical Officer of Health, a quarter of a century of work, of which over fifteen years have been busily spent in Islington. During this period it has been my constant, and as I think very successful, aim to keep the Borough as a whole in a good sanitary state. I cannot, however, conceal from myself the fact that the homes of a very considerable section of it are now growing very old; that very many of them are occupied by numerous families; that many of the landlords are careless of the requirements of their tenants, and that, consequently, it will become more and more difficult to preserve the low death-rate which has obtained in Islington for some years. A great deal, however, can be accomplished by continuous and untiring effort. There must be no relaxation in the incessant inspection of these properties, and in the enforcement of the sanitary statutes, particularly those relating to overcrowding and the provision of sufficient sanitary accommodation for the persons occupying them. It is because of this that I have dwelt so long in the early part of the report on the housing of the people, on which subject I presented a very full report a few years ago, a copy of which I will be happy to forward to any of you who may desire to be more fully informed on the subject Wholesome houses, a good water supply, a pure milk supply, and the proper care and feeding of infants are the chief means whereby Islington's great salubrity can be preserved. And these can only be secured by maintaining a sufficient and efficient staff of Inspectors. viii. The report deals fully with the work of the department, which grows with each succeeding year larger and more important, and I trust its perusal will lead to an appreciation by the members of the Council, so many of whom, now for the first time, become acquainted with it, of its great importance to the community. I cannot conclude without thanking the members of the Public Health Committee for the kindly manner in which they have received my reports and suggestions, and saying that it has been a great pleasure to me to work with men whose greatest anxiety has been the health and welfare of the Borough. I must also thank my colleagues in the Public Health Department, who, from Mi". J. R. Leggatt downwards, have always endeavoured to afford me every assistance, and to render my task as light as possible. I am. Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, Medical Officer of Health. Town Hall, Islington, N. ls< June, 1907. X. SUMMARY of Vital Statistics, 1906.

THE POPULATION, AREAS AND DENSITIES OF THE SUB-REGISTRATION DISTRICTS, THE WARDS AND THE BOROUGH. 8 [1906 REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health FOR THE YEAR 1906. There are three factors which must be accurately determined, and fully considered, when discussing the vital statistics, or to be quite accurate, the statistics relating to mortality, of any community, before a correct interpretation of their significance can be formed by the inquirers after truth. This is especially essential if he should desire to contrast the returns of one County, City, or district with those of another; it is even more necessary in London, where the mortality of a district is so frequently gauged by a comparison with that of the metropolis as a whole, or with specially selected Boroughs within the County. In this connection there are three factors of importance to be considered: namely, Area, Population and Density. The Area at first sight may not seem of so much consequence as either of the other factors, but after a little consideration it will be apparent that it is of great moment to know how it is divided, how much of it is open space or lake, river or park, and how much is built upon. It will be necessary to know respecting the Population how its ages are cast; the relative proportions of infants, children, youths, middle-aged, and old persons, for as the mortality rates vary at different ages, so will differences in the way that the population is cast be important, because they will affect the number of deaths. With respect to Density, which in this respect signifies the number of persons located in houses on each acre, it is apparent that a population which is crowded together on a limited space is not so likely to be equally healthy with one that has more room to breathe. We will, therefore, proceed to examine B 2 4 1906] these matters so far as Islington is concerned and at the same time draw attention to similar particulars affecting the metropolis, and some of its boroughs which, as it were, encircle this borough. Area. Of the Borough.— The Islington boundaries embrace 3,092 acres, of which only 45⅜, or 1.5 per cent., are open space, a proportion which is small when compared with the Metropolis, where it represents 7.6 per cent., or more than five times that of Islington. In Hackney the open space represents 18.6 per cent. of the area, in Finsbury 1.9, in Hampstead 12.4, in St. Pancras 15.4, and in Shoreditch 1.1 per cent. Consequently Islington is worse off with respect to open space than any of these boroughs except Shoreditch, and, therefore, it is at a disadvantage so far as what are not inappropriately called "lungs" are concerned. These breaks in the continuity of streets and houses are of the greatest advantage, particularly when they are nicely planted and carefully tended, for they not only form reservoirs, as it were, of more or less pure air, but also afford a place to which the aged poor, the infirm, and the invalid can come to enjoy the sight of flowers and plants, and to rest. To them they are, indeed, God's gift, for they tend to lighten many an hour, as well as to hasten restoration to health. Happy is the community that possesses many of them ! The area of Islington, though very large, is— it will be a surprise to many Islingtonians, who are accustomed to speak of it as the largest parish in England, to learn— not so large as several of the London Boroughs. Thus Greenwich covers 760 more acres than Islington, Hackney 197, Lambeth 988, Lewisham 3,922, Wandsworth 6,038, and Woolwich 5,185. Since all these places possess lesser populations, the greater area is an advantage to them from a sanitary point of view. Of the Sub-Registration Districts.— The area of the Borough has been sub-divided by the Registrar-General for registration purposes into seven sub-districts, whose sizes vary very considerably. Thus Highbury embraces 798 acres, and Upper Holloway only 290, while the areas of the other districts are as follows:— Tufnell 417, Tollington 320, Lower Holloway 413, Barnsbury 309, and South-East Islington 545. In only four of these subdistricts are there open spaces, viz.:— Lower Holloway, in which they cover 11¼ acres, in Highbury 29½, Barnsbury 2⅛, and in South-East Islington 3¼. 5 [1906 Of the Wards.— These also differ very much in size, varying from 417 acres in Tufnell and in Highbury to 137 in Barnsbury, The areas of the other wards are, Upper Holloway 290 acres, Tollington 320, Lower Holloway 413, Mildmay 337, Thornhill 172, St. Mary's 148, Canonbury 286, and St. Peter's 155. With respect to open spaces, it is to be remarked that none of the northern wards, Tufnell, Upper Holloway or Tollington, possesses any, while Lower Holloway is favoured with 11¼ acres, Mildmay with 1¼, Highbury with 27¼, Thornhill with Barnsbury with 1¼, and Canonbury and St. Peter's together with ⅝, Canonbury with ½ (a playground) and St. Mary's v/ith * 1⅜ acres. So much for the area of the borough and its sub-registration districts and wards. It is next to be told how these areas are peopled, and the several ages and sexes of those living on them. Density. Of the Borough.— By this term is meant the number of persons living, on an average, on each acre of the borough. It has gradually increased year by year as the population has increased, for there has been no extension of the borough boundaries, and consequently more and more people have been squeezed together on its area. It will be recollected that at the beginning of the last century the great parish of Islington was the same size as ihe borough of Islington is to day; but then it was nearly all green fields, with only 10,311 persons living within its boundaries, while to-day there are no green fields, and, as we have seen, its population is 344,987. Hence its density has increased from slightly over 3 persons per acre in 1801, to nearly 112 in 1906. The gradual increase of the density may be seen from the following figures, which are based on the decennial census returns. Year. Persons per acre. Year. Persons per acre. l801 3.28 1861 50.0 l8l1 4.84 1871 68.8 1821 6.89 1881 91.0 1831 12.1 1891 102.8 1841 17.9 1901 108.4 1851 30.6 1906 (estimate) 111.6 6 1906] At the present time Islington is more densely populated than any of the great provincial towns, and in the County of London it ranks twentysecond of the boroughs in order of density, there being only seven with a higher one. These are facts it is well to keep in view when considering its mortality returns, which are unusually low for a community which is so numerous and so crowded. Of the Sub-Districts.— Not all the districts are alike crowded— Indeed, when comparison is made between them it is found that whereas Tufnell and Highbury possess respectively only 82 and 84 persons to the acre, South-East Islington and Barnsbury confess respectively to 140 and 175, while Lower Holloway with 101, Tollington with 112, and Upper Holloway with 124 occupy the intermediate positions. Of the Wards.— Here too, the density varies considerably, as it ranges from 74 persons per acre in Mildmay, 82 in Tufnell, and 84 in Highbury, to 150 in Barnsbury, 195 in Thornhill, and 212 in St. Peters, while between these come Lower Holloway with 101, Tollington with 112, Canonbury with 115, St Mary's with 118, and Upper Holloway with 124. Generally speaking, it is found that those districts and wards which are most densely populated exhibit the highest death-rate, which will be shown when the death returns are discussed. Population. Population of the Borough.— The estimated population of Islington at the middle of the year was 344,987, which has been calculated on the figures that were obtained at the censuses of 1891, 1895, and 1901. This estimate shows an increase of only 1993, or 0.5 per cent., on that of the preceding year. If a comparison be made with the figures of the earlier years of the Borough, or rather of the old Parish, it will be apparent that the annual increase is much less than it was in those times when it was no uncommon circumstance for the growth to be three, four, five, or even seven per cent. This is very well seen in the figures (reprinted from the annual report for 1904) in which it is shown that from 1801 onwards to 1851 the percentage increase was continually rising, but that from this date down to the last census (1901) it gradually decreased. 7 [1906 Census Years. Enumerated Actual Decennial Percentage Population. Increases. Increases. l801 10,212 — — l8l1 15,065 4,853 39.7 1821 22,417 7,352 40.5 1831 37,316 14,899 66.4 1841 55,776 18,460 49.4 1851 95,329 39,553 70.7 l86l 155,341 60,012 63.1 1871 213,749 58,408 37.1 1881 282,865 69,116 32.3 1891 319,155 36,290 12.8 1901 334,991 15,836 4.9 The annual increase has fallen to 0.49 per cent. now, which is the lowest in the history of Islington. It is a moot question, however, whether or not this percentage increase shall fall still lower. The probability is that it will not, because, although there are empty houses in Islington, the majority of which were occupied by members of only one family, it is more than likely that many of these will be lei out in the future to two or more families, probably occupying a lower status in the community than their former tenants, so that the population may possibly increase at a greater rate than at present. Of course, this would mean more crowding in an already fully peopled Borough, and would tend to promote a less favourable condition of health in the community. Hence it becomes more essential than hitherto not only not to abate by one jot or tittle the stringency of sanitary inspection, but to keep even more vigilant watch and ward over the sanitation of the borough and the food of the people. Housing of the Population.— It is not easy to obtain information as to the actual number of inhabited houses in the Borough, as the rate books only show rateable premises or hereditaments, of which there were 46,531† in 1906, and do not distinguish those that are dwellings from mere business places or other unoccupied premises. We are, therefore, compelled to fall back on the census of 1901 for the necessary figures, at which period it was found that there were 38,645 occupied houses, each of which contained on an average 8.6 persons. These last figures indicated the greatest amount of crowding hitherto recorded in the old parish or more modern borough of † In 1896 the number was 44,748. 8 1906] Islington. It may be of interest to see how the population was, housed, in the past. This is shown in the following figures:— No. of inhabitants Year. No. of houses. to each house. 1811 2,339 6.3 1821 3,495 6.4 1831 5,797 6.4 1841 8,508 6.5 1851 13,528 7.0 1861 20,704 7.5 1871 27,079 7.9 1881 34,046 8.3 1891 37,875 8.4 1901 38,645 8.6 This statement indicates that the housing of the people did not keep pace with the increase of the population, and that consequently the residents crowded more and more together, so that a house wherein a single family lived at one time became occupied by two or more families. This points to the steady growth in the number of tenements which were let to individual families, to which allusion will be made presently. The number of occupants in the house is naturally not the same in each of the sub-districts, for it is found that:— In Highbury there are 8,786 houses with 7.3 persons per house. In Upper Holloway there are 12,149 houses containing on an average 8.2 persons per house. In Islington South-East there are 8,034 houses with 9.4 persons per house. In Barnsbury there are 5,558 houses with 9.8 persons per house. In Lower Holloway there are 4,118 houses containing on an average 10.1 persons per house. In a most complete report, which was presented to the Council in 1904, the question of crowding was dealt with at great length, and it was then shown as indicated by the figures just given, that the houses of Lower Holloway are more crowded than the houses in any of the other sub-districts, after which comes Barnsbury, then Islington South-East, next Upper Holloway, and lastly Highbury. As this report is so replete with information respecting the housing of the people of Islington it is very essential that the present Borough 9 [1906 Council should have some inkling as to its tenour, and therefore it seems to the Medical Officer of Health necessary to quote the following extract from it:— "Now with respect to the number of separate families living in the borough, I find that in 1891 there were 72,652 families distributed among 37,875 houses, which give an average of 1.91 (nearly 2) families per house, and that they had increased in 1901 to 79,129 families, living in 38,645 houses, or an average of 2.04 families per house. Thus there was an inciease of 0.13 family per house. This is not a very large increment, but when it is recollected that there are many thousands of houses occupied by single families, it represents much more than it appears to do by a mere recital of the fact, for the increase occurs only in tenement houses. This is more apparent when the different sub-districts are examined separately. It is not, however, possible to contrast the figures calculated from the last census returns with figures based on the 1891 census, because the latter unfortunately did not give the necessary information for the sub-districts. I have, however, made calculations on the figures obtained in the census of 1901, and I find that— In Upper Holloway, 22,357 families live in 12,149 houses, or 1.84 families per house. In Lower Holloway, 9,243 families live in 4,118 houses, or 2.24 families per house. In Barnsbury, 13,781 families live in 5,558 houses, or 2.48 families per house. In Islington, South East, 18,847 families live in 8,034 houses, or 2.34 families per house. In Highbury, 14,901 families live in 8,786 houses, or 170 families per house. "It is, therefore, found that the houses in Lower Holloway, in Barnsbury and Islington South East, contain more families per house than the average which obtained throughout the Borough, and that those in Upper Holloway, and Highbury contain fewer families. "These facts do not, however, enable me to come closely in touch with the small areas of the Borough containing comparatively few people, that is to say, from 1,000 to 1,500, and with houses that are overcrowded, although they do direct attention to particular districts which might be all the better for closer examination. 10 1906] "In seeking for suitable areas for my investigations I was driven to adopt the enumeration districts that were defined when the census was last taken, for about them alone could particulars be obtained; although I am bound to state that they do not altogether meet my requirements, for many of them are ill-defined, badly planned, and of extraordinary contours. An examination of the map* which I have laid before you will fully bear out this statement Nevertheless I have been able to extract from the returns concerning these areas particulars which are of the greatest importance, and were most useful in the preparation of this report. "For the purposes of the census the borough was divided into 271 Enumeration Areas, each of which contained, on an average, 1,235 persons. The averages varied, however, in the several registration sub-districts. Upper Holloway was divided into 66 areas, each with an average population of 1,513; Lower Holloway into 36 areas, each with an average population of 1,150; Barnsbury into 54 areas, each with an average population of 1,008; Islington South East into 70 areas, each with an average population of 1,077; and Highbury into 45 areas, each with an average population of 1,417. "From the returns relating to each area, I have abstracted the number of tenements containing less than five rooms, together with the number of persons residing in them. I have also after a long—though fortunately not difficult— process ascertained the number of these tenements that are " overcrowded," by which term I am to be understood to mean overcrowded according to the dictum of the Registrar-General †; and from the figures thus obtained I have calculated the percentage number of tenements that are overcrowded, as well as the percentage number of persons living under overcrowded conditions; and lastly I have abstracted the ages of these persons at four periods of life. It is much to be regretted, however, that the ages of children between 5 and 10 were not available, as they are very material factors in deciding the question of overcrowding, because every two children under that age only count as one person, a circumstance which seems to have been either entirely forgotten or else ignored by the Registrar General. The result of this omission is that I have been compelled to use his method, and to make my calculations as if the persons were all adults. It may be stated, however, that a fairly accurate estimate of the number of children under ten years of age may be obtained by halving the number of persons betweeen 5 and * This Map may be seen in the Medical Officer of Health's office. † "Ordinary tenements which have more than two occupants per room, bed rooms and sitting rooms included, may be safely considered as overcrowded," Census General Report, 1891. 11 [1906 15 years of age and adding the result to the number of children under 5 years This method is based on the fact that 51 per cent. of the children living in the borough above five years, but under fifteen, are between the ages of five and ten years; and, therefore, it is a fair inference that a similar proportion exists throughout the various areas, with possible slight vaiiations. "Now I have ascertained that 18 percent. of the tenements of the borough containing less than five rooms are overcrowded, and I have consequently made this figure the basis for classifying the degree of overcrowding which obtains in each of the 271 enumeration areas which are set out in Table 6, and I have used it in this way. Those areas in which the overcrowded tenements are more than 25 per cent. below the average of the overcrowding of the borough as a whole (18 per cent.) I have called Class I.; those which are less than 25 per cent. below the average of the borough I have called Class II.; those which are less than 25 per cent. above the average of the borough I have called Class III.; while those which are more than 25 per cent. above the average of the borough I have called Class IV. Let me illustrate this by an example. In Table 6*, column 6, it is stated that 26.34 per cent. of the tenements under five rooms are overcrowded, then the calculation is 18.0:26.34::100:146.3. Consequently the crowded tenements are 46.3 per cent. above the average, and therefore, the area would be included in class IV.

This Table, which exhibits the extraordinary variations that occur in the several areas with respect to the character of the tenements, is worthy of careful study, for in some it is seen that one room tenements are the most numorous, in others that two-room tenements are most numerous, and so on. "Indeed, it is a good index also of the circumstances of the inhabitants, for the poorer they are the fewer rooms they occupy. "I have now laid before you the fullest particulars that it is possible to obtain respecting the borough unless, indeed, such as could only be ascertained by a house to house investigation, and, in a great borough like Islington, at a considerable expense and by the employment of a special staff of Inspectors. I think, however, that with the information which is now in your hands you will be enabled to come down on the overcrowded spots of the borough. "It, however, rather exaggerates the prevailing conditions owing to the Registrar-General's definition of "overcrowding;" but bearing this in mind you will be able to distinguish between it and legal overcrowding— that is, from overcrowding to abate which you would obtain an Abatement Order in a Court of Summary Jurisdiction. I do not, however, suggest that you should take no action on this account. Far from it, because I think, firstly, it would be extremely unwise to allow overcrowding to go on until its abatement could only be obtained by legal force ; and, secondly, that the great health interests of the public are best served by the prevention of evils, rather than by their abatement when they have arisen. It is folly to wait to close the stable door until the steed has beenjstolen." 17 [1900 Table 1.

It is obvious to any persons carefully, and with unprejudiced mind, studying these figures that Islington demands very careful watching to prevent its houses becoming greatly overcrowded. Its days for building new houses have all but passed away, for there is no building ground, or very little, available, and, therefore, as people, who for the most part are artizans, come into the borough to reside, they are domiciled in houses that at one time were let to single families. Happily, the action of the Sanitary Staff has up to now greatly retarded overcrowding, to the annoyance and possibly the pecuniary loss of some owners, who aver that they cannot make the properties pay unless more people are allowed to live in them. However this may be, it must be impressed on those who govern this great borough, that it will be an evil day for it when there is the slightest relaxation of the stringent measures that are now and have been for a long time adopted here, for it would quickly become a large slum area, and a menace to the metropolis. c 2 20 1906] The Number of Persons living at different ages.— To arrive at these figures it is necessary to refer to the census of 1901, at which time it was found that there were:— 108 persons in every 1.000 of the population between o— 5 years of age. 185 „ „ ,, 5—15 „ 199 „ „ „ 15—25 „ 182 „ „ „ 25—35 „ 130 „ „ „ 35—45 „ 93 „ „ „ 45-55 „ 60 „ „ „ 55—65 „ 31 „ „ „ 65—75 „ 12 „ „ „ 75 and upwards. These were not always the proportions into which the population was divided, for an analysis of the preceding two censuses show that a change has been coming gradually over its age distribution. This can be best seen by placing in juxtaposition the analyses of the last three enumerations of the people in Islington. Age Periods. 1 Years. Percentage of increase or decrease (+ or —) between. 1881 2 1891 3 1901 4 1881 & 1891 5 1881 & 1901 6 1891-1901 7 0—5 133 1l8 108 —11.3 —l8.8 -8.5 5—15 206 206 185 — -10.2 —10.2 15—25 197 200 199 +1.5 +1.0 -0.5 25—35 172 172 182 — +5.8 +5.8 35—45 122 124 130 +1.6 +6.5 +4.8 45—55 8l 87 93 +7.4 +14.8 +6.9 55—65 52 54 60 +3.8 +15.4 +11.1 65—75 27 28 31 +3.7 +14.8 +11.0 75 and upwards 10 11 12 +11.0 +20.0 +9.0 Here it is seen that at the age period 0—5 there has been a steady decrease in the relative proportion of persons living at this age compared with 21 {1906 the whole population, so that between 1881 and 1891 the number fell from a proportion of 133 in every 1,000 of the population to 118, or a decrease of 11.3 per cent., and between 1891 and 1901 it fell from 118 to 108, or a decrease of 8.5 per cent., while between 1881 and 1901 the fall was from 133 to 108, or 18.8 per cent. When the age period 5-15 is examined, it is noticed that the proportion of 206 to every 1,000 of the population remained the same in 1891 as it was in 1881, but when comparison is made with 1901, it is at once apparent that there has been a heavy decrease, namely from 206 to 185, or 10.2 percent. In 1901 the decrease compared with 1891 was continued into the 15—25 age period, although it is slightly above the 1881 period. Thus it is seen that at the present time there is a continued decrease in the proportion of persons living at the several groups of ages up to and including the 15-25 period, while at the later groups of ages there is a steady increase. This means that the proportion of old people is increasing and that of young people is decreasing. To see rightly what this means it would be well to apply the figures given in columns 2 and 3 to the estimated population of the year (1906) and to contrast the result with each other. This has been done in the following table:— Number of persons that would be now living Estimated in Islington if the population had been cast in population the same proportions as in in Age periods. 1881. 1891. 1906. o— 5 45,883 40,708 37,258 5—15 10,067 71,067 63,823 15—25 67,962 68,997 68,652 25—35 59,338 59,338 62,789 35—45 42,088 42,778 44,848 45—55 27,944 30,017 32,084 55—65 17,942 18,629 20,699 65-75 9,314 9,659 10,694 75 and upwards 3,449 3,794 4,140 All ages 344,987 344,987 344,987 22 1906] Thus the movement in the age of the population between 1881 and 1901 has shown the great decrease of 15,879 in the number of persons living at the age 0-15, of which the period 0-5 is responsible for 8,625. These figures very clearly indicate the direction in which the population has changed and is changing. It is becoming more mature; infancy, childhood, adolescence are passing away. How serious the shrinkage in juvenile life is may be grasped from the fact that if the population under 5 years of age had been the same as in 1881, there would now be living 8,625 more children than there are, and even if it had remained as in 1891, there would be living in the borough 3,450 more than are recorded. When we examine the figures at the next age period (5-15), it is found that in 1881 and 1891 they were in the same proportion, but owing to the change in the population in 1901, it is found that it has caused a decrease of 7,244. At the third age period (15-25,) although there was a change for the better in 1891, yet in 1901 there was a decrease in the number compared with the aggregate population, so that to-day it is estimated that there are 345 fewer persons living than if the proportion of 1891 had obtained in 1901. The fourth and subsequent age periods show an increased number of persons living compared with what they would have been if the 1881 and 1901 proportions had obtained. It is not necessary to go through them seriatim, for they are set out in the table, but they emphasize the fact that the population of Islington is an older population than it has been hitherto. Similar changes are occurring in other communities, and without doubt will affect not only them but the Kingdom also. In England and Wales the age distribution of the population has been changing, as may be seen by the following figures, which show the number of persons living at the several age periods in the last three censuses:— 75 and 0-5 5-15 15-25 25-35 35-45 45-55 55-65 65-75 over. 1881 136 229 188 146 113 83 59 33 13 1891 123 228 193 151 115 86 57 34 13 1901 114 210 196 162 123 89 60 33 13 Hence it seems that in England and Wales similar changes to those occurring in Islington are taking place. Thus in the age period 0-5, the proportion of chillren has fallen from 136 per 1,000 in 1881 to 123 in 1891, and 23 [1906 then to 114 in 1901. Among those from 5 to 15 years old the proportion has decreased from 229 in 1881 to 228 in 1891, only a small decrease, and to 210 in 1901. In the next age period, that of adolescence, 15-25, the population has increased from 188 per 1,000 in 1881 to 193 in 1891, and to 196 in 1901, although in Islington it has remained practically stationary, the proportion being 197, 200 and 199 respectively at the average censuses. At the remaining age periods the general tendency has been for the proportions to increase, and consequently the population throughout the country contains more persons in proportion, and actually, than it has contained at any time during the last sixty years. What bearing these changes may have on the vital statistics will be considered when the mortality returns are dealt with. Table I.

MARRIAGES, BIRTHS AND DEATHS. 80 1906] MARRIAGES. The number of persons married in the borough during 1906 was 5,928, as against 5,968 in 1905, 5,896 in 1904, 6,106 in 1902, and an average of 6,097 in the preceding ten years. The marriage-rate (that is to say the persons married rate) was in the proportion of 17.18 per 1,000 of the population, as compared with 17.40, 17.29 and 18.00 in the three preceding years, and a mean rate of 17.67 in the ten years 1896-1905. The marriage-rate was the lowest since 1895, when it was 15.97 Per 1,000 inhabitants. It varied considerably in the several quarters, being as low as 9.34 per 1,000 in the first quarter, 18.69 in the second, 21.68 in the third, while it fell to 19.01 in the fourth. Table VII.

The number of births registered in the year was 8,659, which were in the proportion of 25.10 per 1,000 persons living in the borough. These births were distributed to the several Sub-Districts as follows:— Births. Birth-rates. Tufnell 746 21.92 Upper Holloway 1,06l 29.46 Tollington 747 20.77 Lower Holloway 1,118 26.8l Highbury 1,348 20.13 Barnsbury 1,679 31.10 South-east Islington 1,960 25.68 8,659 25.10 Illegitimate Births.— So far as can be ascertained from the returns there were 244 illegitimate births, equal to a rate of 0.71 per 1,000 inhabitants, as compared with 242 in 1903, 273 in 1904, and 227 in 1905. A table showing the number of these births in each year, with three exceptions, since 1841 is given below, from which it is seen that the average annual number in each decennial period has been as follows:— Births Births per annum. per annum. 1841-50 64 1881-90 348 1851-60 134 1891-1900 272 1861-70 265 1901-1906 244 1871-80 343 From this statement we learn that during the last twenty-six years there has been a steady decrease in the actual number of illegitimate births, notwithstanding that there has been a large increase in the population ; and, moreover, the figures are even better than they appear, when their relationship to population is studied. Thus the average rate in each decennium was as follows:— D 84 1906] Per 1,000 Per 1,000 Inhabitants. Inhabitants. 1841-50 0.88 1881-90 1.16 1851-60 1.11 1891-1900 0.82 1861-70 1.46 1901-06 0.72 1871-80 1.40 (6 years) The illegitimate birth-rate is, therefore, nearly 50 per cent. below that which prevailed during the ten years 1871-80, nearly 39 per cent. below the rate that obtained between 1881 and 1890, and 13½ per cent. below that during 1891 and 1900. These figures relating to illegitimacy are of course satisfactory, but the figures for the total number of births denote a steady and continuous decline in the general birth rate. The birth-rate for the year 1906 was, as we have seen, only 25.10 per 1,000 inhabitants, which is the lowest hitherto chronicled locally. It is more than 12 per cent. lower than the mean birthrate (28.65) of the ten years 1841-50, when the borough was in its infancy; 27.3 per cent. lower than the decennial rate 1851-60 when the rate was 34.54 per 1,000; 32.5 per cent. lower than in the period 1861-70, when it was 37.20; 17.2 per cent. lower than the rate between 1871-80, when it was 30.3; nearly 22.9 per cent. lower than that of 1881-90, when it was 32.56; and 14.3 per cent. below that of the five years 1901-05, when it was 29.31. This fall in the birthrate has been general to the kingdom, and has attracted universal attention, particularly in view of the fact that the death-rate among infants remains practically stationary, although the general death-rate has steadily declined. In preceding reports the causes of the decline of the birth-rate have been discussed and they may be summed up as follows:— 1. The deliberate act of married persons not to procreate children. 2. The later age at which women marry. 3. Variation in the proportion of women at the child-bearing age in the population. 4. Variation in the marriage rate. 5. Decrease in illegitimate births. The Registrar-General in his report for 1905 avers that there are, however, sufficient grouuds for stating that during the past 35 years approximately 35 [1900 about 17 per cent. of the decline of the birth-rate (based on the proportion of births to the female population aged 15-45 years) is due to the decrease in the proportion of married women in the female population of conceptive ages, and about 10 per cent. is due to the decrease in illegitimacy. With regard to the remaining 75 per cent. of the decrease, although a proportion of the reduced fertility may be ascribed to the changes in the age constitutions of married women, there can be little doubt that the greater part of it is due to deliberate restriction of child bearing on the part of the people themselves. These remarks, made with respect to the country, are equally applicable to Islington, where, without doubt, the same factors are at work in lowering the birth-rate. The following statement gives for comparative purposes the birth-rate for the country as well as for some of the most populous places:— England and Wales 27.0 per thousand living. 76 Great Towns 27.8 „ „ „ less London 28.3 „ 142 Smaller Towns 26.5 „ London 26.5 „ Birmingham 29.4 „ Liverpool 32.7 „ Manchester 29.3 „ Leeds 26.2 „ Sheffield 29.9 „ Bristol 25.9 „ St. Pancras 26.0 „ Stoke Newington 20.8 „ Hackney 24.7 „ Hornsey 18.3 „ Finsbury 30.2 „ Shoreditch 34.2 „ The Encircling Districts 26.2 ,, Islington 25.1 D 2 1906] 36 Birth-rates of Islington from 1841 to 1906.

The number of deaths registered in Islington during the year 1906 were 5,050, as compared with a corrected average of 5,910 in the preceding 20 years; and the resulting death-rate was in the proportion of 14.64 to every 1,000 of the population, as against a mean rate of 17.13 during the years 1886-1905. This low rate is very little higher than that which obtained in 1905 when it was 14.44; and if we examine the mortality statistics from 1838, the first year of registration to the present time, it appears that on only two occasions has it been so good, namely in 1903, when it was 14.27, and in 1905 as already stated. Such a low rate as that now reported is highly gratifying, and testifies to the healthy condition of Islington, the largest of the Metropolitan Boroughs. Perhaps the improvement is best seen by comparing the present deathrate with the rates which obtained in the past. Periods. Death-rates. Periods.

The results are now seen in reduced death-rates, despite the fact that strong influences are at work in another direction. It has been hinted already that a change that has come over the population of the borough, through the alteration of its sex and age incidence, has had some effect on its mortality returns, but unfortunately not a favourable one. In a previous part of this report it has been shown that, if the population had been cast as regards sex as it was in 1891, there would have been 162,684 males, and 182,303 females in the borough, instead of respectively 163,524 and 181,463, which it is estimated, on the basis of 1901 census, at 41 [1906 present prevails. Presuming that the death-rates were the same among the males and the females as those which obtained in 1906, namely 15.8i among males and 13.53 among females, then the number of deaths that would have been registered would have been 2,583 males instead of 2,593, and 2,466 females instead of 2,457, which were actually registered, making a total of 5,049 instead of 5,050 actually registered, a difference of only one death. Consequently it is apparent that the change in the casting of the sexes did not make any material difference in the general mortality. When, however, the variation of the ages of the population is considered then the effect is more substantial, for it is found that the male deaths would have numbered only 2,527 instead of 2,593, the actual number, and the female only 2,440 instead of 2,457, the actual number. Deaths that would have occurred if the age distribution of the Actual Deaths Population had remained in 1906. as in 1891. Difference. Males - - 2,593 - 2,527 - 66 Females - 2,457 - 2,440 - 17 Total - 5,050 - 4,967 - 83 Thus the change in the age distribution has unfavourably affected the mortality returns by 83, which although a comparatively small number in so large a population, yet is of importance when it is recollected that the deathrate of the borough has steadily diminished despite the facts that the change in the age incidence as well as in the position in the social scale of its inhabitants are working against it, and is an additional proof, if any were wanted, that the administration of the health affairs of the borough have had an enormous effect in reducing the death-rate. The unfavourable effect of the change in the age incidences has possibly been even greater than has been stated, because it must not be forgotten that it is now six years since the census was taken, that at that time the change was in process, and consequently that there has been a greater variation in 1906 than has been indicated. The actual changes at each period of life produced by the alteration of the age incidence of the population is seen in the following table :— 42 1906] Males. Females. Age. Death-rate in 1906.

The Borough Rate Contrasted with those of other places—By a reference to Table XXV it is seen that not only was the Islington death-rate lower than that of England and Wales, of the 76 Great Towns but also of rural England. It was also lower than the death-rate for the County of London, in which the rate was 15. per 1,000, and than the collective rate of the boroughs which encircle Islington, which was also 15.1 per 1,000. The Ages at Death.—These are fully set out in Table XVI where it is satisfactory to note that there was a decrease in the number of deaths at all ages up to the 45-55 period of life Thus there was a decrease of 338 when compared with the average (uncorrected for the increase in the population) of preceding ten years in the deaths of children under five years of age, of which, however, 146 were due to the changed incidence of the ages, as set out in the 43 [1906 table on opposite page; of 42 between the ages of 5 and 15, of which 15 were due to the same cause; of 48 between 15 and 25; of 40 between 25 and 35; of 69 between 35 and 45: and of 11 between 45 and 55. There was, however, an increase of 12 in the age period 55-65; of 24 in that of 65-75; of 38 in that of 75 and 85, and of 22 above 88 years of age. These figures are most satisfactory because they show a decrease in the number of deaths exactly at those periods of life which are most affected by the sanitary conditions amidst which people live, and are therefore, testimony to the improvement that has taken place in them. Mortality in the Sub-Registration Districts.—The highest deathrate, 17.90 per 1,000, was experienced in Barnsbury where the deaths numbered 967, and the lowest, 11.63, in Highbury where 779 were registered. In Lower Holloway the rate was 17.30, and the the deaths numbered 721; while in Islington South-east the rate was 15.51 per 1,000, and 1,184 deaths were recorded. In Upper Holloway the death rate reached only to 15.05 with 542 deaths, and in Tufnell it was as low as 12.70 per 1,000, caused by 432 deaths; Tollington was nearly as healthy as Highbury, for there the death-rate reached to only 11.82 per 1,000 with 425 deaths. (Vide Table XVIII.) Mortality in the Wards.—The most healthy ward was Mildmay, where the death-rate was 10.32 per 1,000, and then followed in order Tollington 11.82, Tufnell 12.70, Highbury 13.32, Canonbury 13.43, St. Mary's 14.62, Upper Holloway 15.05, St. Peter's 16.43, Lower Holloway 17.29, Barnsbury 17.51, and Thornhill 18.15 Per 1,000 inhabitants. (Vide Table XIX). SEASONAL MORTALITY. The mortality during the year varied considerably according to the season. Thus in the first quarter there were 1,391 deaths registered, and the death-rate was 16.12 per 1,000, or 3.83 per 1,000 below the mean-rate of the similar quarters of the preceding twenty years. In the second quarter they fell to 1,151, equal to a death-rate of 13.34 Per 1.000, or 3.05 below the meanrate of the years 1886-1905. Again in the third quarter the mortality slightly increased, the death-rate being 13.48 per 1,000, but 2.48 below the record of the years mentioned, while in the fourth quarter it rose still further to 15.59, which was, however, 2.79 below the mean-rate of the twenty years. Very full particulars as to the causes of death have been published already in the reports for the several quarters. 44 1906 Table XV.

The mortality among infants is perhaps the most important subject which at present is engaging the attention of all persons who are directly or indirectly interested in the prevention of disease or death; and the fact that a bill, recently introduced by a private member into the House of Commons, to compel the notification of births to the Medical Officer of Health within thirty-six hours was received with sympathetic cheers from all political parties, points to the deep impression that has been made on the minds of our legislators as to the necessity of something being done to stop the great waste of infant life that is taking place in this country, owing to the ignorance and carelessness, not always intentional, of mothers about the care of themselves both before and after their children's births, as well as of the infants whom they are expected to rear. This subject is happily engaging the serious attention of the Public Health Committee of this borough and it is hoped that when their report comes before the Council that it will receive that great consideration which the subject demands, and which those who understand this question expect. In 1906, out of 8,659 infants that were born, 1,083 died before they had reached the end of their first year of life, so that the deaths were in the proportion of 125 to every 1,000 infants who were born. This is a high mortality, although happily not nearly so high as that which occurs in other boroughs or districts. The rate is almost identical with the figure for 1905, namely 123, and with this exception is the smallest hitherto recorded in Islington. The record of the mortality of infants has never been published in full in any report of the Medical Officer of Health, and, therefore, as the subject is of such vital interest, it is now given as far as the returns can be accurately ascertained. 56 1906] Table XXVI.

In other words that where in the former period out of every hundred births 15 infants died, in the latter period 13 died. The reduction is so insignificant that it may be considered of little moment, and that the record of these sad deaths, arrived at for the most part through untold suffering, remains stationary. If such a state of affairs were to have been the result of the sanitary efforts put forward to prevent illness and to reduce the death-rate among the population at large it would be conceded at once that they had been without avail and that the money spent on them had been thrown away. Unhappily no attempt has been made and therefore no expenditure has been incurred in endeavouring to lessen the mortality among these little ones. It is nearly thirty years since the present Medical Officer of Health of Islington, then a young private practitioner, first drew attention to this waste of infant life*, but although the subject was afterwards commented upon by the "Lancet" and other medical papers, nothing was done. The public were careless, and the importance of the subject had not yet been brought home to the nation, whose leaders have only recently commenced to grasp its serious consequence to the growth and virility of the country. A nation with a young population is full of energy, vitality, and "go," whereas, when the opposite is the case its people are much less vigorous and energetic in their pursuits. The causes of the 1,083 deaths among infants is set out in-Table XXVII, which also gives a summary of those in the preceding ten years. Its careful study will show that many of the deaths there recorded are entirely preventable, and, therefore, would not have occurred if only the mothers knew and understood the duties of maternity and the method of rearing children. In this connection it may be stated that during the summers of 1905 and 1906 special inquiries were made as to the method of feeding of 220 infants who had died from diarrhœal diseases, when it was found that only 23, or 10.5 per cent., were reared on the breast alone, while 197, or 89.5 per cent., were fed on cows' milk and artificial foods. It was further ascertained that 72, or 32.7 per cent., were fed from a boat bottle, 112, or 50.9 per cent., from a tube bottle, and 13, or 5.9 per cent., from a spoon or cup. * " The Preventive Causes of Infantile Mortality," a Lecture delivered before the Portsmouth Literary and Scientific Society. 58 1906] These are facts and figures that must give cause for thought, for they indicate strongly and with no uncertain voice that the maternal breast milk is the one and only food, except where the mother's state of health prevents, on which to rear an infant. It is clear, from the information that was obtained, that in the larger number of cases the mother was able to suckle her progeny, for it showed that her health was Good in 151, or 68.6 per cent., of the cases. Moderate in 24, or 10.9 „ „ Bad „ 37, or 16.8 „ „ Not stated,, 8, or 3.7 „ „ 220 100.0 Why, then, did not the mothers with good and moderate health rear their children? It is difficult to say; but whatever the cause, they have evidently forgotten that their first duty is to the helpless infant they have brought into the world, and that every consideration should be subservient to this end. The Infantile Mortality in the various parts of the borough was as follows:— Deaths under one year. Births. Deaths per 1,000 Births. Tufnell - 91 ... 746 122 Upper Holloway- 111 ... 1,061 105 Tollington 95 ... 747 127 Lower Holloway - 173 ... 1,118 155 Highbury 128 ... 1,348 95 Barnsbury 232 ... 1,679 138 South-East Islington 253 ... 1,960 129 The Borough 1,083 ... 8,659 125 • ... - - It will be noticed that the death-rate was least in those districts where the social scale was highest, and highest where the social scale was lowest, thus supporting the statement that ignorance is a large factor in the causation of infantile deaths. 59 [1906 In England and Wales, in the seven greatest towns, and in the boroughs surrounding Islington, the infantile mortality rates were as follows:— England and Wales 133 Per 1 000 births.

Small Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Fevers {that is to say Typhus, Enteric and, Continued), and Diarrhœa. The returns from these diseases are satisfactory for they record only 562 deaths, as compared with a corrected average of 779 in the preceding twenty years, so that there has been a decrease of 217. The epidemic death-rate for the year was 1.63 per 1,000 of the population, compared with a mean rate for the twenty years of 2.26. Only twice previously has it been so low, namely 1903, when it was 1.39 per 1,000, and in 1905 when it was 1.54 per 1,000. An examination of the registers reveals the pleasing feature that, with the exception of an insignificant increase in the mortality from measles and diarrhoea, each of the diseases exhibited a decline (vide Table XXVIII), which amounted to as many as 86 in the case of Diphtheria, 98 in that of Whooping Cough, and 24 in that of Enteric Fever. The decline in the epidemic diseases is best seen by making a comparison between the quinquennial periods. During the five years 1886-90 they numbered 3,885; from 1891 to 1895, 3,969; from 1896 to 1900, 4,013; and from 1901 to 1905, 2842. Thus in the last quinquennial period there was a decrease on its predecessor of 1,171 deaths, of which Measles contributed 335, Scarlet Fever, 35, Diphtheria, 335, Whooping Cough, 251, Enteric Fever, 60, and Diarrhcea, 202.

There was no death registered from this disease. MEASLES. There were registered 187 deaths, equal to a death-rate of 0.54 per 1,000 of the population, of which 93 occurred in the first quarter of the year, 75 in the second, II in the third, and 8 in the fourth. This disease is very difficult to control, especially since the attendance of children at school has been more rigidly enforced, and it therefore causes great anxiety to all school and health authorities, who are devoting great attention to the problem of its prevention in schools, because once it has made its appearance among the scholars it is almost impossible to prevent its spread. Measles therefore receives special care. In the following ix schools, class rooms were closed and disinfected. ist Quarter. Vittoria Place L.C.C. School. St. Thomas' Schools, Everilda Street.

The secondary causes set out in the death certificates are generally the real causes of death, as uncomplicated measles is not usually fatal, and of these pneumonia and bronchitis are the most frequent.

Exactly the same number of deaths were registered as in the preceding year, namely 37. which are equal to a death-rate of o.11 per 1,000 inhabitants. It is a notable fact that since 1897 the deaths have never exceeded 40, although previously they had been far more numerous. There seems little doubt that the disease is not so virulent as it used to be. Indeed, the fatality rarely exceeds 3 per cent., and during the year under discussion it was only 27 per cent. The deaths were distributed very equally in the four quarters of the year, 10 being credited to both the first and second 9 to the third, and 8 to the fourth. 75 1906 Table XLI.

Only 32 deaths were ascribed to Diphtheria, under which term is included Membranous Croup, as compared with an average of 69 in the five years 1901-05, and 136 in the five years 1896-00. The decrease in the number of deaths has been accompanied by a decrease in the number of cases, but the former have decreased in a far greater ratio than the latter, as may be seen in the following statement:— Year.

The return of 74 deaths is the lowest registered in the Borough for very many years, indeed, it is doubtful if since 1851 there have been so few. The figures for each year are not available, although those for each decennium are, and they show that between 1851-60 the deaths averaged 102; between 1861-70, 173; between 1871-80, 286; between 1881-go, 207; and between 1891 and 1900, 170 per annum ; while during the five years 1901-05 they have averaged only 116.

For the fourth year in succession the deaths from this disease have been remarkably few, and in 1906 they numbered only 19, as compared with a corrected average of 43 in the preceding twenty years. In 1903 there were 22 deaths, in 1904, 18, in 1905, 17. Its records for each year since 1885 have been given in Table XXVIII, but it may be stated that in the five years 1896-90, on an average, 52 deaths were registered per annum; in the next five years 1891-95, 37; in the succeeding five years 1896-1900, 44: and in the five years 1901-05, 20. This reduction in the deaths from Enteric Fever is especially gratifying, as it is essentially a disease amenable to sanitary measures. The deaths occurred at the following age periods:— 5-15 I or 0.0. per 1,000 living at this age 15-25 5 „ 0.07 99 99 25-35 4 99 0.06 „ „ 35-45 4 99 0.09 99 99 45-55 4 99 0.12 99 99 55 and upwards 1 99 0.02 99 99 79 1906 Table XLVII.

No death was recorded during the year, which is the seventh in succession since one was registered. Indeed only 5 deaths have been known since 1888. CONTINUED FEVER. Nil return. DIARRHCEA. The deaths from diarrhoea, including Epidemic Enteritis, were 213 as compared with a corrected average of 216 in the preceding twenty years, and were equal to a death-rate of 0.62 per 1,000 of the population. This rate compares favourably with the rate for the County of London, in which it was 0.94 per 1,000, and with that of the combined rate for the boroughs which encircle Islington, which was 0.88. The deaths recorded in the several periods of the year were:— Diarrhoea. Other Diarrhceal Diseases.

Thus in the first quarter they exceeded it by 6, in the second by 2, in the third by 8, and in the fourth by 7. It will be noticed that as usual the largest number of cases occurred in the third quarter which is the hottest period of the year, and a reference to the Table I in the Medical Officer's report for that period shows that out of the 167 deaths of Diarrhoea and Epidemic Enteritis 134 were under a year old. The fact is that the bulk of this mortality was due to the careless and ignorant manner in which infants are fed and their food stored. As the subject is receiving special attention by the Public Health Committee it will not be pursued further here at present. 81 [1900 Table XLIX.

This disease was more than usually prevalent, and caused 67 deaths, as compared with 54 in 1905, 48 in 1904, and 40 in 1903, and with a corrected average during the ten years 1896-1905 of 70. Although the 13 deaths in the first quarter of the year were 25 below the average, yet in the second quarter the 21 deaths were 9 above it. In the third quarter the deaths numbered 7, or 3 above the average, while in the fourth they increased to 26, or 10 above the average, the total number for the year being 3 below it. Influenza has now been more or less endemic in Islington since 1890, when it caused 38 deaths, which ro?e in the following year to 184, and was followed in the succeeding years by 18 r, 123, 51 and 179, and thence onwardb by the deaths which are given in Table LVII. Prior to 1890 and as far back as 1856, the disease was hardly known here, for a careful search of the returns has shown that between 1856-60 only 18 deaths were registered ; between 1861-5,12; between 1866-70,10; between 187175, 2; between 1876-80, 2; between 1881-5, 2; between 1886-90,40, of which 38 were registered in 1890. Between 1891 and 1895, however, the number increased to 718, which were followed in the next five years, 1896-00, by 410 deaths, and then by 271 in the five years 1901-5. When the disease made its appearance in epidemic form in the United Kingdom in 1890 it was known as Russian Influenza and as La Grippe, and it was generally thought that after a short time it would disappear altogether. It is doubtful if the disease which we know as Influenza is the same as that registered prior to the great pandemic of 1899-90, but rather one of a catarrhal description, usually spoken of as an " influenza cold," which was unaccompanied by those severe neurotic, cardiac, and gastric symptoms which render it so fatal, particularly to the weak and the old. Epidemics of the disease in its present form have, however, occurred before in this country, and their history is fairly well known. Indeed, a malady, whose symptoms may be said to have been identical with what was known later on as Influenza, was described in the fourteenth century in Ireland. It was epidemic in Europe in the early part of the sixteenth century, and since then in various countries. It has been with us all too long now and its disappearance would be gladly welcomed, the more so that it does not appear amenable to sanitary control, nor do overcrowding, bad ventilation, or 89 [1906 insanitation seem to favour its spread. Indeed, it Has been remarked of it that it spreads as quickly through the suburbs as it did through the crowded streets and alleys, and is, therefore, in these respects, very unlike the ordinary infective diseases.

Under this heading are included those affections which were formerly comprised under the terms typhlitis, peri-typhlitis, epi-typhlitis, paratyphlitis, &c., all of which, however, have their origin in that part of the bowel known as the appendix. It attacks both males and females, but apparently the former more than the latter, for in the report of the RegistrarGeneral for 1905 the mortality appears to have been 60 per million of the population among men and 40 per million among women. It assails persons of all ages, but more particularly those between twenty and thirty. It may occur in an infant or a person eighty years old. The reason it is more frequent among males than females is probably that they are more subject to traumatism, which is a condition of the system resulting from an injury, to which persons who undergo much muscular exertion or lift heavy weights are liable. Recent investigations, too, seem to indicate that heredity has some influence, for it is not uncommon, according to a recent writer, to find "two, three, or even four cases in one family." Errors in diet may lead to an attack, as also fœcal concretions, and, occasionally, foreign bodies as apple pips and other fruit seeds (causes which are greatly exaggerated), while also microorganisms play an important part, for there is now no doubt that when bacilli coli collect in the appendix they become virulent and set up inflammation. During the year 20 deaths were registered in the Borough at the following ages:- 1906. 1905. 0-5 years 0 1 5 ,, 3 4 10-15 „ 2 1 15-20 „ 3 6 20-25 ,, 1 3 25-35 ,, 2 3 35-45 ,, 5 4 45-55 „ 1 4 55-65 ,, 2 2 65-75 ,, 1 1 20 29 Of these 20 cases 12 were males and 8 females. 92 1906] SEPTIC DISEASES. The best known of these diseases are Erysipelas, Pvæmia, Septicaemia, and those grouped under the general term Puerperal Fever. Altogether they caused 45 deaths. Erysipelas.—The register returns 16 deaths, 7 being of males and 9 of females, as compared with a corrected average of 14 during the ten years 1896-05, and they were equal to a death-rate of 0.05 per 1,000 of the population. It appears to have been fatal to 3 children under a year old, while of the remaining number, 2 were between 1 and 5 years, and 11 were over five years. Six of the deaths occurred in the local institutions. Table LIX. Deaths from Erysipelas in the Sub Districts during the Year 1906. Deaths. Death Rates. Tufnell 1 00.3 per 1,000 inhabitants.

This return is 1 below the average of the preceding ten years, and is in the proportion 127 per 1,000 registered births as compared with 1.05 in the decennium 1896-1905. It is sad to think that several of these cases would never have occurred if only proper precautions had been observed by the mothers themselves with respect to cleanliness in their surroundings prior to the birth of their children. Inquiries have shown that it is a habit among women in the lower classes to put soiled and dirty clothing on their beds and on themselves, at the time of their confinement, when it is essential that every article brought into contact with them should be scrupulously clean. It is a heavy punishment when women have to pay for their ignorance with their lives. They do not know, and they do not understand, that the cardinal rule at a lying-in is absolute 94 1906] cleanliness of the room, the bed, the bedding, the clothing, and the person, not only of the patient herself, but of her attendants, whether they be medical men, nurses, or unskilled women, while at the same time it is not possible for the air of the room to be too pure.

In this group of diseases are included Cancer, Tubercular Diseases, Rheumatic Fever, Rheumatism, Rickets, Diabetes, Gout, and a few other diseases (vide Table LXVIII). It is proposed to refer briefly to some of them. Cancer or Malignant Disease.—It is an unpleasant fact to have to chronicle that under this heading there were registered no less than 363 deaths, which are equal to 10.52 per 10,000 of the population. That is to say that just over 1 in every 1,000 of the population died during the year. Inasmuch as only 9 of these deaths occurred in persons under 25 years of age, it is at once apparent that the deaths assume a high proportion among those who are over that age. Thus between 25 and 35 among every 10,000 persons, there were 1.11 deaths, which increased to 779 in the next age period, 35-45; and to 28.06 in that following, 45-55; until between 55 and 65 over 52.85 persons out of over 10,000 died; between 65-75, 69.98; and above 75 years of age 93.46. These are very serious figures, and therefore, no surprise can be expressed at the anxiety of scientists to discover the true cause of these diseases. 96 1906] The deaths among men during the year numbered 154, and were equal to 9.39 Per 10,000 of that sex living in the borough, while those among women numbered 209, or 11.55 in every 10,000 females. In the last report of the Registrar-General for England and Wales he points out that the mortality from malignant disease is not alarming until after the 35th year of life, and that with advancing age it rapidly becomes more fatal. This, too, is the Islington experience, as has already been pointed out. Inasmuch as the question is of great moment and, therefore, of interest, the comparison between Islington and England and Wales is shown in the following table, which gives the death-rate per ten thousand of the population. MALES. FEMALES. Ages. Islington. England and Wales. Islington.

It is a sad list, and indicates that many poor souls have had a rough passage to eternity. What is occurring in Islington is taking place throughout our land and, therefore, it is no wonder that at the present day there is so much investigation and so much anxiety to discover the cause of the malady in the hope that something may then be found to neutralize or destroy it. 97 [1906 The record for Islington since 1891 is again given:— [##3]Years Deaths Deaths per 10,000 Pop.

Tuberculosis of the Lungs or Phthisis, Tuberculosis of the Brain, Tuberculosis of the Larynx, Tuberculosis of the Abdomen or Tabes Mesenterica, and General Tuberculosis. Phthisis-It is satisfactory to find that the return of 411 deaths is the lowest which has been made in Islington during thirteen years, and that it is as many as 135 below the corrected average of those years. The death-rate was equal to 1.19 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 1.58 per 1,000 in the period 1894-1905. The mortality from Phthisis always bears a high ratio to the deaths from all causes registered in the Borough, and during 1906 it was 8.14 per cent., a proportion which compares favourably with that of 9.96 per cent. during the thirteen years selected for comparative purposes. 1906] 102 A statement of the Heaths during the Inst 13 years is set out below, and shows the enormous death toll which this disease demands annually:- Years.

It is one of early life and is without doubt amenable to preventive measures, the carrying out of which, however, mainly devolves on the mothers of the children. 24 deaths were those of males and 12 of females. Tubercular Meningitis or Hydrocephalus was noted as the cause of 80 deaths, of which 36 were those of males and 44 of females. With 23 exceptions all were among children under 5 years of age. Tuberculosis of the Larynx caused 3 deaths, one of which was that of an infant, and the other 2 of persons over 5 years of age. General Tuberculosis was registered as having caused 32 deaths, of which 7 were under 1 year old, 13 between 1 and 5, and 12 above this age. 104 1906] Table LXVII.

These diseases, which include Acute and Chronic Bronchitis, Pneumonia, Pleurisy,and Asthma, caused 904 deaths, or 17.9 per cent. of the total number of deaths from all causes, and were equal to a death-rate of 2.62 per 1,000 of the population. Bronchitis, Acuta.- To this cause were ascribed 161 deaths, of which 81, or just one-half, were those of infants under a year old, a fact which causes serious misgivings as to the care with which their young lives were tended, because one naturally inquires how came it that these children were so exposed as to contract this ailment. The total death-rate was 0.47 per 1,000 inhabitants. Bronchitis, Chronic.—288 deaths were registered, 131 of males and 157 of females, and were equal to 0.83 per 1,000 of the population. Pneumonia caused 410 deaths, of which 103, or just one-fourth, were those of infants under twelve months old, many of which were due, without doubt, to causes which were entirely within the power of the parents to prevent, as in the case of acute bronchitis. 218 deaths were those of males, and 192 of females. The deaths were in the proportion of 119 to every 1,000 persons living in the borough. Pleurisy was the ascribed cause of the deaths of 19 persons, of whom 9 were males and 10 females. Asthma caused 16 deaths, 9 males and 7 females. Other diseases of respiration were returned as the cause of the deaths of 10 persons, 5 of whom were males and 5 females. It is not satisfactory to find so many as 184 infant deaths ascribed to bronchitis and pneumonia, for reasons that have been stated. An analysis of the returns shows that they occur chiefly in the first and fourth quarters, that is in the cold weather, when infants require the greatest care. 107 [906 Acute Bronchitis Pneumonia Total 1st quarter 25 44 69 2nd „ 16 21 37 3rd „ 6 10 16 4th „ 34 28 62 81 103 184 ALCOHOLISM. Under this head there were registered the deaths of 16 persons, of whom 5 were men and 11 women. This return is the smallest during five years and 9 less than in 1905, and 12 less than the average number which obtained during the years 1901-5. The number of deaths during each year sinc£ 1901 have been as follows:— Acute. Chronic. Total Males. Females. 1901 27 27 7 20 1902 9 29 38 20 18 1903 3 23 26 13 13 1904 4 18 22 12 10 1905 4 21 25 9 16 1906 3 13 16 5 11 Totals 154 66 88 On the basis of these figures it is apparent that Alcoholism has been more fatal to women than to men, in the proportion of 57 of the former to 43 of the latter in every hundred deaths. 108 1906] VENEREAL DISEASES. To these diseases, which comprise Syphilis and Gonorrhoea, were ascribed the deaths of 16 persons, of whom 11 were males and 5 were females. They included, it should be noticed, the deaths of 9 children under a year old, while only 6 were adults. The record of these diseases during the last six years has been as below:- Under l year. 1-5. Adults.

It is not to be supposed, however, that the deaths among adults due to venereal diseases are so few as this return would show, for there are undoubtedly many diseases of mature life, causing death, which would never have occurred if the persons attacked by them had not suffered at an earlier period from syphilis. The chief of these are locomotor ataxia, dementia paralytica, certain types of epilepsy, and arterio-sclerosis. Indeed, the heart, arteries and veins of syphilitic persons are all liable to be affected. Many deaths consequently are attributed to these and other diseases as the primary causes, whereas they are in reality only secondary. DEATHS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. The returns show that 1,603 persons, residents of Islington, died in the public institutions of London, or 22 more than in the previous year, and 96 above the average of the preceding ten years. The return is the highest since 1902 when it was 1,646 and is even worse than it appears, for whereas in 1902 109 [1906 the deaths represented 29.2 per cent. of the deaths from all causes, they represented 31.5 per cent. in 1906, while the mean percentage for ten years has been 27.4. Within the Borough.—In 1906 the total number of deaths in local institutions numbered 1,574, which 955 were of Islingtonians, and 619 were of strangers who had come into the borough for treatment at a local institution or at the Holborn Infirmary, which is situated in Upper Holloway, and of whom 418 died. Inhabitants.-Of the 955 who died, 717 were registered from the Islington Infirmary, 98 from the Workhouses, and 106 from the Great Northern Hospital. Besides these, there were 2 deaths in St. Pelagia's Creche, 4 in the Tufnell Park Nursing Institution, 3 in the London Fever Hospital, 11 in the Memorial Cottage Hospital, 2 in the Invalid Home, Aubert Park, and 5 in the Clothworkers' Almshouses (vide Table LXX.) Non-inhabitants.-In addition to the deaths of 418 persons in the Holborn Infirmary already referred to, there were 28 others who died in the Islington Infirmary. 94 in the Great Northern Central Hospital, 6 in the Aged Pilgrims' Asylum, 19 in St. Pelagia's Creche, 12 in the Aged Blind Home, 2 in Tufnell Park Nursing Institution, 10 in the London Fever Hospital, 10 in the Memorial Cottage Hospital, and 3 in the Invalid Home, Highbury Terrace (vide Table LXX.) Without the Borough.-No less than 648 Islingtonians died in 1906 in 84 institutions outside the borough, whither they had gone for treatment, and the names of which are set out in Table LXXII. It must be noted, however, that as many as 76 of these deaths occurred in the Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street, 69 in St. Bartholomew's Hospital, 51 in the London Temperance Hospital, 38 in University College Hospital, and 36 in the North Western Fever Hospital. It is to be noted also that there were 21 deaths in the Claybury Lunatic Asylum. Within and without the Borough.-Altogether 1,603 inhabitants of Islington, or 31.5 per cent., of the total deaths of Islingtonians, died in Public Institutions which were situated within or without the Borough. Accidental and Sudden Deaths without the Borough.-36 such deaths occurred in the several Metropolitan Districts, and are set out at the end of Table LXXII. In the preceding year they numbered 31. 110 1906] Table LXIX.

THE NOTIFICATION, ISOLATION, FATALITY, AND PREVENTION OF DISEASE. INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN THE PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND ON BUSINESS PREMISES, TOGETHER WITH THE OCCUPATIONS OF THE PERSONS ATTACKED. 120 1906] NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Small Pox, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Membranous Croup, Enteric or Typhoid Fever, Erysipelas, Continued Fever, Relapsing Fever and Cholera. These are the infectious diseases which medical practitioners and parents and guardians, or those having charge of patients, are compelled to notify to the sanitary authority of Islington under the provisions of section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. During the year under observation the number of notifications was 2,275, or 347 more than were made known in the preceding year. They are, however, 375 below the corrected average of the preceding 10 years (Vide Table XCV). The notified cases in proportion to the population represent an attack-rate of 659 per 1,000 of the inhabitants, which is slightly in excess of the rate of the preceding year, when it was 5.62, but below that of the preceding 15 years, during which it averaged 8.6 per 1,000. There is, therefore, a decrease of 20.1 in the rate. The return is particularly satisfactory, as with the exception of Scarlet Fever, all the diseases were below the average records, after correction for increase of population, of the preceding 10 years, and even in the case of Scarlet Fever, the increase (20) was so small that it is hardly worthy of consideration. Thus Small Pox was 41 below the average, Diphtheria as many as 239, Enteric Fever 79, Erysipelas 33, and Continued Fever 2, while Typhus Fever and Puerperal Fever remained at the average. The returns for the County of London show that there were 35,340 notifications, which represent an attack-rate of 7.48 per 1,000 of the population of the metropolis. In the Encircling Boroughs 5,956 cases were notified, which are equal to an attack-rate of 7.25 per 1,000 of the inhabitants. 121 [1906 The figures are as follows:— Cases. Attack-Rate. St. Pancras 1,419 6.oo Stoke Newington 240 4.51 Hackney 1,864 8.08 Hornsey 631 7.26 Finsbury 838 8.60 Shoreditch 964 8.30 The above Boroughs 5,956 7.25 County of London 35,340 7.48 Islington 2,275 6.59 From this return it will be seen that Islington does not compare unfavourably with the neighbouring great sanitary authorities. Indeed when one considers how it is circumscribed, its density of population, and the large number of its schools, it is hardly too much to say that its health, as judged by the notifications, is very good. In previous reports a statement of the number of cases of each disease that were notified since 1891 have been given, but as the great majority of the present Council have not had an opportunity of studying them, they are set out again. They are as follows:— Years. Cases. Attack.rates. 1891 2,059 =6.43 per 1,000 inhabitants. 1892 3,318 =10.26 ,, ,, 1893 4,853 =14.84 ,, ,, 1894 3,121 =9.44 ,, ,, 1895 2,841 =8.50 ,, ,, 1896 3,822 =11.32 ,, ,, 1897 2,906 =8.62 ,, ,, 1898 2,418 =7.18 ,, ,, 1899 2,943 =8.75 ,, ,, 1900 2,276 =6.78 ,, ,, 1901 2,852 =8.50 ,, ,, 1902 3,164 =9.20 ,, ,, 1903 1,707 =5.03 ,, ,, 1904 1,941 =5.69 ,, ,, 1905 1,928 =5.62 ,, ,, 1906 2,275 =6.59 ,, ,, 122 1906] Sub Registration Districts.-The infectious diseases were distributed in the sub-registration districts as follows:- Cases. Attack-rates. Tufnell 193 5.67 Upper Holloway 241 6.69 Tollington 160 4.45 Lower Holloway 313 7.5o Highbury 374 5.58 Barnsbury 372 6.90 Islington South East 622 8.15 Total 2,275 6.59 This table shows that the largest number of cases in proportion to population occurred in South-East Islington sub-district, whilst the smallest came from Tollington. In the former the attack-rate was 8.15 per 1,000 of the inhabitants and in the latter 4.45. In the Wards the cases notified and their proportion to the population were as follows:- Cases. Attack-Rates. Tufnell 193 5.67 per 1,000 inhabitants.

They were 80 below the corrected average (552) which obtained in the first quarter of the preceding 10 years. This was due to a decrease on the average of the 10 years of 14 Small Pox, 47 Diphtheria, 2 Membranous Croup, 21 Enteric Fever, 16 Erysipelas, 1 Puerperal Fever and of 1 Continued Fever. The quarter, as judged from these returns, was eminently healthy. The return showed an increase of 21 cases of Scarlet Fever on the corrected average (256) of the first quarter, 1896-1905. In the Second Quarter, the cases, which numbered 484. produced an annual attack-rate of 5.61 per 1,000 of the inhabitants, were 74 below the average (558) of the corresponding quarters of the preceding 10 years. The decrease included 17 cases of Small Pox, 64 Diphtheria, 3 Enteric Fever, 5 Erysipelas, and 2 Continued Fever. The return showed an increase of 22 cases of Scarlet Fever on the corrected average of the corresponding period for 10 years. In the Third Quarter 569 cases, producing an annual attack-rate of 6.6o per 1000, were notified, as compared with an average of 726 in the corresponding period of the preceding 10 years. The decrease of 157 cases included 4 Small Pox, 47 Scarlet Fever, 68 Diphtheria, 14 Enteric Fever, 21 Erysipelas, and 3 cases of Continued Fever. In the Fourth Quarter there was 750 cases notified, which represent an attack-rate of 870 per 1,000 of the inhabitants, as compared with the corrected average of 814, and an attack-rate of 943 in the corresponding period of the preceding 10 years. The decrease of 64 included 5 cases of Small Pox, 56 Diphtheria, 40 Enteric Fever, and 2 cases of Puerperal Fever. The return, however, showed an increase, on the corrected average, of 21 cases of Scarlet Fever and 19 cases of Erysipelas. Fatality.-By the term "Fatality" in this report is meant the percentage proportion of deaths to the cases of infectious disease notified. It is a means of estimating the virulence of a disease. In the year under observation there were 115 deaths among the 2275 cases that had been made known by medical practitioners, and these were equal to an annual fatality of 5 per cent., which is the lowest percentage 124 1906] hitherto recorded. In the preceding year it had fallen to 5.5 per cent., while on the other hand the average of 15 years had been 8.5 per cent. In this long period 44,427 cases have been notified, of which 3,765 have died, or a percentage of 8.5. An examination of the returns given below, particularly of those since 1900, show that there has been a steady diminution in the fatality from the infectious diseases. This is particularly noticeable in the cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria, which will be shown later under their proper heading. The numbers of the total cases for each year since 1891 are as follows:— Years. Cases. Deaths. Fatality. 1891 2,059 258 12.5 1892 3,318 291 8.7 1893 4,853 383 7'9 1894 3,121 339 10.8 1895 2,841 266 9.3 1896 3,822 390 10.2 1897 2,906 258 8.8 1898 2,418 173 7.1 1899 2,943 238 8.1 1900 2,276 202 8.8 1901 2,852 250 8.7 1902 3,167 268 8.4 1903 1,707 108 6.3 1904 1,942 119 6.1 1905 1,927 107 5.5 1906 2,275 115 5.0 Total 44.427 3,765 8.5 125 [1906 SMALL-POX. It is satisfactory to note that only one case of Small-pox was notified. This occurred in Highbury, but was not indigenous to the Borough, as the person who was attacked had only arrived within a few days from Bilbao, where, without doubt, he contracted the disease. He was removed to hospital, where he recovered. The patient had been vaccinated in infancy. In the County of London there were only 31 cases notified, which occurred in the following districts:- Paddington, Islington, Hackney, Bethnal Green, Stepney, Poplar, Bermondsey, Chelsea and Deptford.

The number of cases gradually increased from the beginning of the year, for while 277 were notified in the first quarter they grew to 307 in the second quarter, to 341 in the third quarter, until they reached 461 in the fourth quarter. Fortunately the type of the disease was very mild, so that only 37, or 27 per cent., died. Although the number of cases was more than usual, the rate was less than that of the County of London, in which it was 4.31, and of the Encircling Boroughs, where it was 423 per 1,000. Hospital Isolation.-As many as 1,226, or 88.4 per cent., of the cases were removed to hospital. This is a very large proportion, and without doubt the removals largely tended to prevent the spread of the disease in many houses let in lodgings or tenements, and also to safeguard the London County Council Schools from infection. Fatality.-Out of the 1,386 cases, only 37 patients, or 2.6 per cent., died. This fatality is in marked contrast with that of 15 years ago, for an examination of the returns shows that at that period it amounted to 6.8 per cent. Table LXXVII.

Diphtheria was notified in 437 instances, as compared with a decennial average of 678, so that there was a very substantial decrease in the known cases of this disease. The cases were equal to an attack-rate of 1.27 per 1,000, as against a rate of 1.96 during the preceding decennium. It is also satisfactory to note that it compared favourably with the attack-rate of London, which was 1.71, and with that of the Encircling Boroughs, which was 1.48 per 1,000. Hospital Isolation.-It is gratifying to observe that 344, or 78.3 per cent., of the cases were removed to hospital for treatment. Fatality.-32 deaths were registered among the 437 cases, so that the fatality rate was equal to 7.3 per 1,000 of the known cases. This is the lowest record since their notification was first made compulsory, when it was as high as 23.5 per cent. This record is so remarkable that the return of the cases, deaths, and fatality is herewith given, as it is well worthy of permanent record, showing, as it does, that it has decreased 69 per cent. since 1891.

There were only 149 cases of Enteric Fever notified, as against a decennial average of 228, or a decrease of 79. The disease, however, was of a particularly mild type. These cases were equal to an attack rate of 0.47 per 1000, as compared with a decennial rate of 0.66. This rate is slightly above that of the Encircling Boroughs and of the County of London, in which there were respectively 0.37 and 0.34. Hospital Isolation.-122 cases, or 8r.9 per cent., were removed to hospital for treatment and isolation. Fatality.-Only 19 deaths, or a fatality of 12.7 per cent., occurred among the 149 cases. This fatality compares favourably with the preceding year, when it was 17.0 per cent., and with the decennial period 1891-1900, during which it averaged 16.9 per cent. The percentage now recorded is the lowest that has been known since the notification of infectious disease became compulsory in Islington. Table LXXXVI.

One case of Typhus Fever was notified. Curiously enough, the medical practitioner returned the case as one of Enteric Fever, and it was only when there was an opportunity of carefully examining the patient in hospital that the true infection was diagnosed. It is impossible to ascertain how he became infected, but it is probable he contracted the disease at Peterborough, where he had been on a holiday. An examination of his home showed the surroundings to be very good, while his employment, that of a telegraph messenger at the Great Northern Railway, suggested that it could have played no part in the infection. This is only the fourth case that has occurred in Islington during six years and the 14th in a period of 16 years. The patient was removed to hospital, where he ultimately recovered. ERYSIPELAS. The notifications from this disease numbered 274, and are 33 less than the decennial average of 307. They represent an attack-rate of o'8o per t,ooo of the population, as against a decennial rate of o'8g. In the Encircling Boroughs the rate was rn, and in the County of London ro6 per 1,000 inhabitants. Hospital Isolation.—52 cases, or 19 per cent, were treated in hospital, whither they had gone in the first instance, and whence they had been notified. Fatality.—16 cases, or 5 8 per cent, of those attacked, died. This rate is slightly in excess of that in the preceding year, when it was 47, but considerably less than the fatality that occurred in 1904, when it was as high as S'2 per cent.

Twenty-five cases of this disease were known, and represented 277 per 1,000 of the women who had been delivered of children during the year. This number exactly coincides with the decennial annual average. The attack-rate is slightly in excess of that of the Encircling Districts, in which it was i-go, and of London, in which it was 2*38 per 1,000 births. Hospital Isolation.—Only 8 cases were removed to hospital, or 32 per cent, of the entire number. Fatality.—The number of deaths was it, or 44 per cent., as compared with 25 per cent, in the preceding year, which was a remarkably low rate. In 1904 the fatality was as high as 56 per cent.; in 1903, 47-3 ; in 1902, 54*5 per cent.; in 1901, 44*3 percent.; while from 1891 to 1900 it averaged 38-o per cent. Table XCII.

Phthisis has been voluntarily notified by medical practitioners to the Medical Officer of Health since January ist, 1905, since which time 145 cases have been reported by them, of which 64 were notified during 1906, 30 occurring in their private practice and 34 in their public practice. The Relieving Officers also gave information concerning 62 cases, so that altogether 126 cases came to the knowledge of the Public Health Department. A call was made in each instance at the patient's residence and printed instructions as to the precautions it was advisable to adopt were left with him or with his guardians. In addition to these cases 411 deaths came to light through the death registers, and in every instance, where the deceased had died at home, the Medical Officer of Health offered the occupiers of the premises to disinfect the patient's rooms and bedding. As a result of the information gleaned through the notifications and the death registers, as many as 369 rooms in 258 separate premises were disinfected, while the bedding, &c., were also disinfected. This action on the part of the sanitary authority must have a good result, for undoubtedly the thorough disinfection of premises and rooms wherein patients suffering from consumption of the lungs have lived must, by destroying the bacilli which are the active agents of its spread, considerably check the spread and propagation of the disease. The offer of disinfection is, as a rule, gladly received and highly appreciated by the relatives and friends. Indeed, while the Medical Officer of Health was writing these lines the following letter, received from a man who had lost his wife, was placed in his hands :— Baking Street, 8th May, 1907. Dear Sir, Yours of the 6th inst. to hand. I am only too pleased to help you in stamping out this awful disease, but as the funeral does not take place until Saturday I must ask you to leave it until Monday. Kindly let me 154 1906 know what time the Inspector will call and I will make arrangements for someone to be there, as you will see by the above address that I am not staying there. Thanking you for same, Yours faithfully, A. E. Harris, Esq., F. C. M Medical Officer of Health, Town Hall, Islington, N. From the above facts it may be judged that the Sanitary Staff of the Borough are performing thoroughly good work. INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. An examination of the investigation sheets of the Sanitary Inspectors disclosed the fact that out of the total of 2,276 cases of infectious diseases notified by the medical profession, 998 were children who attended one or other of the public elementary schools in the borough, and that 508 children who were not scholars lived in houses from which other children attended these schools. Thus 43.9 per cent, of the total number of notifications were children attending school and 22.3 per cent, were children who lived in the same house with scholars. The returns further show that the scholars suffered from the following diseases:— Scarlet Fever 785 Diphtheria 177 Enteric Fever 33 Other notifiable diseases 3 998 These figures compare with 640 cases of Scarlet Fever, 138 cases of Diphtheria, 31 of Enteric Fever, and 23 of other diseases in 1905, and are in excess of the returns so far as Scarlatina is concerned since 1902, and of Diphtheria and Enteric Fever since 1903, while other diseases were below previous records.

Indeed, the London County Council School Code prohibits their admission in most cases until the teacher has received a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health stating that the premises were free from infection. It may be mentioned here that the regulations of the London County Council, with regard to the exclusion of children, have recently undergone revision, and it is therefore necessary to state those that now prevail. 156 1906 LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL SCHOOLS.

Note.—If a medical attendant or the medical officer of health should certify, in any special case, that periods of exclusion should be extended, teachers are to observe their instructions and to at once communicate with the Medical Officer (Education). 157 1906 Small Pox.—No case of this disease was known amongst children attending the public elementary schools. Scarlet Fever.—785 children were attacked, as against an average of 655 during the past 10 years. This return is the highest since 1896, when 842 scholars suffered from this disease. It is, therefore, no wonder to find that Scarlet Fever attacked some scholars in every school except one, namely, St. Pauls, Dorset Street. The schools chiefly affected were Rotherfield Street, in which 36 cases occurred; Station Road, where there were 35; Canonbury Road, 32; Blundell Street, 44; Ecclesbourne Road, 40; Queen's Head Street, 40; Burghley Road, 26 ; Cottenham Road, 21; and Gifford Street, 24 cases. A list is given of the cases in each school in Table CVII. These were also known 280 cases among children who lived in houses from which other children attended the several elementary schools. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup.—177 cases were known amongst scholars, as compared with an average of 274 in the preceding 10 years. With two exceptions this is the smallest number that has hitherto been chronicled. There were also 145 cases among children who lived in houses whence other children attended school. Enteric Fever. - 33 cases occurred among scholars and were distributed among 22 schools. The return is 13 below the average of the preceding ten years. There were also 50 cases known among persons who lived in houses whence children attended school. Other Fevers, which include Erysipelas, attacked only three children, while on the other hand 31 cases were known among persons who lived in houses from which children attended the several elementary schools. Non-Notifiable Diseases.—Never before in the history of the London public elementary schools have so many cases been reported to the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough as in 1906, when 4,135 cases were notified by the head teachers. Of these 1,935 were Measles, 425 Chicken Pox, 300 Whooping Cough and 1,375 other diseases such as Mumps, Skin Diseases, etc. In the great majority of these cases the Sanitary Inspectors visited the scholars' houses and left instructions as to what the parents should do under 158 1906] the circumstances and as to the attendance at school of other children in the houses. This return is very satisfactory, for it shows that at last the school authorities are alive to the assistance they can obtain from Medical Officers of Health in protecting their schools from infectious disease. From 1891-1898 no returns, or only very few, were received by the Medical Officer of Health, but in 1899, owing to the strong representations that had been made, 829 cases were notified. In the following year the number rose to over 3,000, and then, with a slight increase in 1901, fell again in 1902. The exact numbers notified in each year are as follows:— 1899 829 1900 3,066 1901 3,395 1902 2,307 1903 2,298 1904 2,425 1905 3,397 1906 4,135 It need not be said that the notification of such a number of cases has enormously increased the work of the Sanitary Inspectors. 159 [1906 Table CVII.

Out of the 2,276 cases that were notified, 1,755, or 77.1 per cent., were treated in hospital and 521, or 22.9 per cent., remained at home. Out of a total of 1,755 cases of notifiable epidemic sickness which were treated in hospitals, as many as 1,577, or 89.9 per cent., were treated in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's hospitals. Altogether 115 deaths occurred among the notified cases of epidemic diseases, of which 82, or 4.6 per cent., occurred in hospitals, and 33, or 6.3 per cent., at home. The Metropolitan Asylums Board's hospitals into which the cases were received are fully set out in Table CIX. It should be pointed out that the 77.1 per cent. of the notified cases treated in hospital in 1906 is the highest figure which has hitherto obtained in Islington, as the following statement shows:— 1896 48.4 1897 55.7 1898 58.4 1899 64.6 1900 68.2 1901 69.6 1902 71.9 1903 72.6 1904 75.5 1905 76.1 1906 77.1 Small Pox.— Only 1 case was known. The patient was a traveller who contracted the disease at Bilbao, and he was isolated in South Mimms Private Small Pox Hospital for treatment. Scarlet Fever.—1,226 out of 1,386 known cases, or 88.4 per cent., were removed to hospital, leaving only 160, or 11.6 per cent., to be attended to at home. This is the largest percentage of Scarlet Fever cases that has hitherto been isolated in hospital. Diphtheria.—Here again the percentage of cases treated in hospital was high, as 344 out of 439 notified cases, or 78.3 per cent., were removed for isolation and treatment; thus leaving only 95 cases, or 21.7 per cent., at home. It must be notified that while 6.4 per cent. of the cases died in hospital, 10.5 died at home, and that too, despite the fact that, as a rule, it is the M 162 1906] severer cases that are sent away. It will be interesting to note that the fatality from this disease in the Metropolitan Asylum Board hospitals has gradually fallen from 29.3 per cent. in 1894 to 8.3 in 1905, which result is generally ascribed to the anti-toxin treatment. Enteric Fever.—Out of the 149 notified cases, 122 or 81.9 per cent. were treated in hospital and of these 72 were isolated in the Metropolitan Asylums Board hospitals. Table CIX.

As usual, a very careful note was made during the year as to the nature of the businesses that were carried on in houses in which the notifiable infectious diseases occurred, and inquiry revealed the fact that in 252 instances the occupiers pursued a trade of some description. This subject has assumed more importance than formerly, because the Factory and Workshops Act makes it a penal offence for the occupier to make, cleanse, or repair any wearing apparel in any dwelling house or building wherein there is a case of Scarlet Fever or Small Pox; consequently the Inspectors are always on the alert to see that these provisions of the Act are not contravened. Apart from its requirements, it is of importance that no businesses should be conducted on premises in which a case of any dangerous infectious disease has occurred, when there is not complete and thorough isolation, a safeguard which is not frequently found. Scarlet Fever.—This infection was noted as being present in 156 business houses. Among the trades carried on were the making of artificial flowers boxes, boots, blouses, belts, confectionery, dresses, mantles, embroidery, tobacco, and many other articles, while in others milk was sold, hair was dressed, wood was cut and many other businesses as set out in Table CXI. Diphtheria was notified from 40 premises whereon businesses were conducted. In all these cases the businesses were suspended where there was a possibility of the goods being infected, until the premises had been disinfected, and the suspected articles had been removed to the Disinfecting Station for sterilization. 165 [1906 Table CXI.

Particulars respecting the occupations of 1,487 patients were obtained, of whom 1,063 were school children, 109 were Housewives, 17 were Clerks, 8 were Porters, 13 were Labourers, 9 were Dressmakers, 5 were Factory Hands, 6 were Milliners, 10 were Charwomen, and the remainder were of various occupations as set out in Table CXII. Small Pox attacked one male, who was an Agent and Traveller. Scarlet Fever was responsible for disease among Teachers, Clerks, Factory Hands, Labourers, Messengers, Machinists, Nurses, and Porters. It also attacked a very large number of school children. Diphtheria.—This disease was answerable for the infection of Blousemakers, Barmaids, Carpenters. Clerks, Gardeners, Cheesemongers, Cornchandlers, Carmen, Draughtsmen, Errand Boys, Housewives, Messengers, Milliners, as well as a large number of school children. Enteric Fever was found among Apprentices, Bookkeepers, Barmaids, Barmen, Clerks, Housewives, Labourers, Milliners, Nurses, Porters and school children. Erysipelas infected 184 persons of varying occupations. For further particulars vide Table CXII. 168 1906] Table CXII.

During the year 376 pathological specimens were examined for the purpose of diagnosing Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, and Phthisis, and of this number 167 were swabs from diphtheritic throats, 56 blood from Enteric Fever cases, and 153 sputum from phthisical patients. Diphtheria.— Of the 167 swabs examined, 68, or 40.7 per cent., gave indications of the disease. It may be pointed out that this is the largest number of examinations that has been made for the diphtheria bacillus since the Council undertook to make them for medical men. Enteric Fever.—Of the 56 samples of blood, 27, or 48.2 per cent., gave the necessary reaction to prove that the cases were Enteric Fever. The number of specimens examined was identical with the preceding year. Phthisis.—There were not quite so many specimens of sputum examined as in the preceding year, when there were 218, but otherwise the number is much larger than in any previous year. In 57 instances the tubercle bacilli were detected, to the great assistance of the medical men who forwarded them. Since the close of the second quarter of 1898, 2,658 examinations have been made for the medical profession, of which 1,003 were swabs from the throats of diphtheritic patients, 662 were specimens of blood from Enteric Fever patients, and 996 samples were sputum from the lungs or throats of persons suspected to be suffering from phthisis. The results of these examinations are set out in the following table:— Diseases. Total Examinations. Positive Results. Negative Results. Percentage of Positive Results.

The complete returns of the children vaccinated in Islington can only be given for the year ending 1905 as they cannot be made up tor fully twelve months after the year has closed. The last return is not so good as that for 1904, for it is found that the vaccinations were in the proportion of 80.5 per 100 births (less infants who died un-vaccinated) as compared with 823 in that year. Notwithstanding this falling off, the figure is higher than any that had been registered between 1894 and 1903. It may be seen in the return which is given on the next page, that from 1880 to the end of 1894 the percentage was never less than 84 per cent., while it was as high as 91.1 per cent, in 1882. During the year 1905, out of 8,603 infants born, 6,360 were successfully vaccinated, 28 proved insusceptible to the operation, 709 died before the time arrived for their vaccination, and 66 were postponed on the production of a medical cetitificate. There were also 110 exemption certificates granted to conscientious objectors, so that altogether there remained 1,330 children, or 17*5 per cent., who were not finally accounted for. 189 [1906 Years.

Disinfectants.—For the first time in buying carbolic disinfectants, the Public Health Committee resolved that they should be tendered for according to their germicidal or bacteriological value, so that so far as possible those with high germicidal properties, and consequently costing more money, might be placed on an equal footing with those whose power was not so great. This method of tendering has come about owing to the standardisation of disinfectants by a process invented by Messrs. Rideal and Walker, and is known as the " Rideal Walker Method." The means of arriving at the relative cost of each is simplicity itself and is ascertained by dividing the co-efficient of efficiency, which interpreted means the number of times the disinfectant is stronger than pure carbolic acid when acting on a pure culture of B. Typhosus, into the price of the disinfectant. By this method the cost per gallon per co-efficient is ascertained. For example, if a sample with a carbolic acid co-efficient of n is quoted at 4s. per gallon, its cost per co-efficient would work out at 4^d., and similarly a disinfectant whose carbolic acid co-efficient was 4*5 and price gd. per gallon, would work out at 2d. per co-efficient. Thus in purchasing, the Sanitary Authority is enabled to procure an article whose exact germicidal value as compared with pure carbolic acid is known. So far the method has answered satisfactorily, but in future it would be well for the Council to invite tenders for disinfectants on the basis of a fixed carbolic acid co-efficient. In this way all manufacturers of disinfectants would be equally enabled to tender on an equality, while the Sanitary Authority would get the exact article it required and it would not be necessary for them to reduce the strength of the disinfectant to that at which they would use or distribute it. The disinfection of rooms, as well as their cleansing and stripping, of schools, and of clothing and bedding, are important features of the work of the Public Health Department. During the last few years also, owing to the passing of the provisions dealing with the disinfection of the premises and clothing of verminous persons, work of this character has fallen on the department, and consequently its duties have been slightly increased, but fortunately nothing more than it has been able to deal with. Prior to 1895, when the Disinfecting Station was erected, the disinfection of clothing, bedding and articles that had been exposed to an infection were sterilized (?) by private contractors, and in the year ending 1895 (March), £378 were paid for that purpose. Since that date this work has been done by the 198 [1906 late Vestry and the present Council themselves at an average cost of about £460 per annum, or £84 more than they paid to the Contractor, while at the same time the work done has been at least tenfold more than formerly ; in other words, if to-day the Council had to pay a contractor for the disinfection of their bedding, clothing, etc., it would cost them nearly £4,000 per annum instead of £462. This is an enormous saving, and fully establishes the utility and desirability of a Sanitary Authority possessing their own disinfecting apparatus. At one time too, it was the custom of the Public Health Department to distribute disinfectants to any person who applied for them at the Town Hall, and at last the abuse became so great that it was decided on the advice of your Medical Officer of Health not to give them away, with the result that whereas formerly fully £1,300 per annum were spent in this way, the sum has now fallen to between £50 and £60, and without detriment to the welfare of the Borough. The fact is that disinfectants as used by the public never, or rarely ever, accomplish any good, for generally speaking they are used unscientifically and only as a means of cloaking one smell with another, and this accomplished, they are satisfied, forgetting altogether that the only true remedy is to discover the cause of the nuisances and to abate them by the application of the necessary measures. Disinfection of Rooms.—During 1906, 2,685 separate rooms were disinfected after the occurrence of an infectious disease, as compared with 2,393 in 1905 and 2,195 in 1904. The disinfectant, as in the preceding two years, employed for this purpose, was formaldehyde, which was used according to the circumstances of the case either in the form of a spray or of a gas. It has proved most useful, economical and reliable, and the results have consequently been most satisfactory. Cleansing and Stripping of Rooms —535 rooms were cleansed and stripped after the occurrence of an infectious disease, as compared with 552 in 1905; and 392 in 1904. The practice has again been pursued to require the stripping only in cases where the infected patient has been for a considerable time in the room, or where the paper has been much broken and very dirty, or when the walls were covered with several papers. In doing this, however, great care has to be exhibited that no damage is done to the walls, the plastering of which is often only held together by the papers that are superimposed. Since the use in Islington of formaldehyde as a disinfectant, the stripping of walls has not been so largely practised. Indeed in 1900, 1,233 rooms were o 1906] 194 stripped, whereas in the following year 1901 only 324 were similarly treated. The figures, however, rose again in 1902 and 1903 owing to the prevalence of Small Pox, in the case of which disease it is essential, as the virulence of the infection is so great, to remove and burn the papers so that there might be no possibility of it spreading. In the following year, when it had disappeared, it will be noticed in the subjoined return that the number of rooms stripped was again small. Rooms Rooms Date. stripped.

Disinfection of Schools.—Principally owing to the presence of Measles in class rooms, disinfection was carried out in the following public elementary schools:—Vittoria Place ; St. Thomas', Everilda Street; Westbourne Road ; Newington Green; Gifford Street; Shepperton Road; Gillespie Road; Pakeman Street; Hanover Street; Holy Trinity; St. Mary Magdalene; St. Pauls, Dorset Street; and Hargrave Park. Verminous Premises.—In seven instances the disinfection of verminous premises was undertaken by the Public Health Department, but the rule has been to serve a notice on the owner under the provision of the London County Council General Powers Act, 1904, to execute the necessary work. In some instances it has been found most difficult to get rid of these pests and their destruction has, therefore, proved a costly matter for the owners. It has generally been found that where they exist in greatest numbers the papers on the walls are most numerous. This should be a lesson to landlords to strip the walls of their rooms when they are about to re-paper them, because there is no better breeding place than in the layers of many papers, where there also is found a proportionate amount of paste on which it is said bugs live, thrive, and propagate their species. 195 [1906 Table CXVIII.

The Act under which it became incumbent on Sanitary Authorities to inspect workshops and places where people are employed is known as the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901. As these duties are very important, and as the Council to which this report is addressed consists for the most part of members new to the work, it is most essential that they should clearly understand the obligations which rest on them under the Act; and, therefore, the Medical Officer of Health feels it his duty to reprint from his Annual Report for 1903 the digest which he there gave. FACTORY AND WORKSHOPS ACT, 1901. This Act, which consolidated and amended all previous Acts relating to factories and workshops, made considerable alterations and additions to the duties of Sanitary Authorities in regard to factories, workshops and such places, and under these circumstances it has been deemed advisable to set before you those features which affect local authorities in London. Definitions.—Factories are classed in two categories— (1) All places in which mechanical power is used in aid of the manufacturing processes; and (2) All places, whether mechanical power is used or not, in which certain specified industries are carried on, that is to say, print works, bleaching and dyeing works, earthenware works, lucifer match works, percussion cap works, cartridge works, paper staining works, fustian cutting works, blast furnaces, copper mills, iron mills, foundries, metal and india rubber works, paper mills, glass works, tobacco factories, letterpress printing works, bookbinding works, flax scutch mills, electrical stations. Workshops are defined to be any premises or places named in Part Two of the Sixth Schedule of the Act, which are not a factory. They include— (1) Hat works, rope works, bakehouses, lace warehouses, shipbuilding yards, quarries, pit banks of metalliferous mines, dry cleaning works and bottle washing works, unless mechanical power is used. (2) Any other premises (not being factories) in which manual labour is exercised by way of trade, or for purposes of gain, in, or incidental to, 201 [1906 the making, altering, repairing, or ornamenting, finishing or adapting for sale of any article, and to or over which the employer of the persons working there has the right of access or control. (3) Any workplace (termed in the Act " tenement workshop ") in which, " with the permission of or under agreement with the owner or occupier, two or more persons carry on any work which would constitute the workplace or workshop of the persons working therein, were in the employment of the owner or occupier." Laundries do not come within the definition of "factory" or "workshop;" but under sect. 103 are, so far as sanitation and means of escape from fire are concerned, to be treated as factories, if mechanical power is used, and as workshops if mechanical is not used. Workplaces are not defined in the Act, but the term is used in the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, sec. 38, where the words " factory, workshop and workplace" occurs, and it was held in a case (Bennett v. Harding) that the word " workplace " is not to be limited to places where something is being manufactured or made, but includes "any place where work is done permanently, and where people assemble together to do work permanently of some kind or other." It is, therefore, a word of wider signification than " workshop." In the case mentioned a stable and stable yard where men were employed as cab cleaners and horse keepers were held to be a workplace. Since then the Secretary of State has been advised that the kitchens of restaurants, etc., though they are not workshops, come within the meaning of the term " workplace." Duties of the Borough Council.—Factories.—The chief duty with respect to factories is the enforcement of the 38th section of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which requires that every factory, workshop or workplace shall be provided with sufficient and suitable accommodation in the way of sanitary conveniences. Workshops and Workplaces.—The Borough Council has important duties with respect to these places: (1) As to their sanitary conditions ; (2) As to special sanitary regulations for bakehouses; (3) As to home work. (1) " Sanitary Conditions."—The Council is made responsible for the sanitary condition of the workshops and workplaces, while the Factory Inspector is responsible for the sanitary condition of factories. Sanitary conditions include (a) Cleanliness; (6) Airspace; (c) Ventilation, and (d) Drainage of the floors. 1906] 202 (a) Cleanliness.—(Sec. 2). Every workshop and workplace must be kept in a cleanly state and free from effluvia arising from any drain, privy earth closet, water closet, urinal or other nuisance ; and if they be not so kept the Council may deal with them under sec. 2 (g. i) of the Public Health London Act, 1891. (b) Air Space.—(Sees. 2-3). Workshops and workplaces must not be over-crowded so as to be dangerous or injurious to the health of the persons employed, and if they are in this condition the Council is empowered to deal with them as a nuisance under sec. 2 (iii.) of the Public Heaith (London) Act, 1891. Under sec. 3 (1) of the Factory and Workshop Act, a workshop is overcrowded, " if the number of cubic feet of space in any room therein bears to the number of persons employed at one time in the room a proportion less than two hundred and fifty, or, during any period of overtime, four hundred, cubic feet of space to every person." By sec. 3 (3) of the Act the Secretary of State has power to alter this amount in the case of a workshop, not being a domestic workshop, " which is occupied by day as a workshop and by night as a sleeping apartment " ; and by his Order of the 17th January, 1902, the amount in such cases has been increased to 400 cubic feet. The Act requires (sec. 3 (4) ) a notice " specifying the number of persons who may be employed in each room," to be affixed in every workshop. (c) Ventilation (sees. 2, 7).—Every workshop and workplace must be ventilated in such a manner as to render harmless as far as practicable any gas, vapours, dust, or other impurities generated in the course of the work, that are a nuisance or injurious to health ; and any such place may be dealt with under sec. 2 (ii) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. This provision is supplemented by a special requirement (sec. 7 (1) of the Factory and Workshop Act), that " in every room in any factory or workshop sufficient means of ventilation shall be provided, and sufficient ventilation shall be maintained," and when a standard has been presented by the Secretary of State, which he has power to make under the succeeding sub-section for any class of workshops, that standard must be observed. By section 157 of this Act, men's workshops, that is to say, workshops conducted on the system of not employing any woman, young person or child are excluded from the operation of this requirement. 203 [1906 In workshops where dust, gas or impurities are generated, and inhaled by the workers, the Factory Inspector may direct that a fan or other mechanical means be provided, if he thinks that thereby such inhalation can be prevented ; and the Home Office recommends that " if in any case the Council are of opinion that this power could be usefully employed, they should refer it to the Inspector of the District." (d) Drainage of Floors (sec. 8).—This is a provision which requires that adequate means shall be provided for draining off the wet in every workshop or part of a workshop in which any process is carried on which renders the floor liable to be wet. A workshop not so drained may be dealt with as a nuisance under sec. 2 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. This section does not apply to men's workshops, or to domestic factories or workshops, but it does to laundries, which are practically the only places affected in Islington. Sanitary Accommodation (sec. 9).—This section does not apply to London, but it enacts that every factory and workshop must be provided with sufficient and suitable accommodation in the way of sanitary conveniences, and where both sexes are employed separate accommodation must be provided. In London proceedings must be taken under sec. 38 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which contains similar provisions. Bakehouses.—The duties of the Borough Council with respect to bakehouses are many, and they deal with — a. The sanitary accommodation. b. The water supply. c. The drains. d. The sanitary fitness. e. The lime-washing, painting, and cleansing. /. Sleeping rooms on the same level as the bakehouse. g. The prohibition of the use of certain underground houses. h. The certification of underground bakehouses. Home Work (sees. 107-115).—The Council possesses important powers of controlling the conditions under which certain classes of work are done, and which are dangerous to the health of the persons working therein; home-work 1906] 201 is prohibited in unwholesome and infected dwellings; and the Council may make an order prohibiting any work being given out to any person living or working there. In case of urgency this power may be exercised by any two or more members of the Council acting on the advice of the Medical Officer of Health. This provision is analagous to the powers given to sanitary authorities with respect to schools under the " Government Code of Regulations for Day Schools." Outworkers' Lists (sec. 107).—Formerly outworkers' lists had to be sent to the Factory Inspectors only, but were to be open to the inspection of the Council. Now, however, they must be sent instead twice every year to the Council. These lists must also be sent in on a prescribed form, which shows the names and addresses of all persons employed by the occupiers of factories or workshops. It is the duty of the Council to have these lists examined, and if the place of employment is in another district to furnish the name and place of employment to the Council of that district. In Islington the outworkers are for the most part females, engaged in making clothing for local, city, or west end employers. Register of Workshops.—The Council must keep a register of all workshops in Islington. Medical Officer of Health (sec. 132).—A new and onerous duty is placed on the Medical Officer of Health, who in his annual report to the Council " shall report specifically on the administration of this Act in workshops and workplaces, and he shall send a copy of his annual report, or so much of it as deals with this subject, to the Secretary of State." The Memorandum of the Local Government Board as to Annual Reports of Medical Officers of Health lays down that the chief points to be reported on by him are :— (1) Sanitary conditions of workshops and workplaces, including (a) Cleanliness. (b) Air space. (c) Ventilation. (d) Drainage of floors on which wet processes are carried on. (e) Provision of suitable and sufficient sanitary conveniences. (2) Special sanitary regulations for bakehouses. 205 [1906 (3) Home-work. Under this heading comes the prevention of homework being carried on in dwellings which are injurious or dangerous to the health of the workers through overcrowding, want of ventilation, or other sanitary defect, or in dwellings in which infectious disease exists. (4) The keeping of the lists of outworkers in certain branches of industry which are to be furnished by employers, and the transmission of the name and place of employment of any such outworker, who does not reside in the district to the Council of the district in which he works. (5) The keeping of a register of workshops. It may be convenient to state here that sec. 102 of the Act, which deals with the enforcement of the law as to retail bakehouses, enacts that " for the purposes of this section, the Medical Officer of Health of the district council shall have and may exercise all the powers of entry, inspection, taking legal proceedings, and otherwise of an inspector "—i.e., of a Factory Inspector. It is also the duty of the Medical Officer of Health, under sec. 133 of the Act, to inform the District Inspector of Factories if he finds any woman, young person or child employed in a workshop in which no abstract of the Act is posted up. Default of Council (Sec. 4).—In the event of the Council failing to administer the provisions of the Act, or of the law relating to public health in so far as it affects factories, workshops or workplaces, the Secretary of State may by Order authorise a Factory Inspector during such time as may be mentioned in the Order, to enforce these provisions, and the Factory Inspector shall be entitled to recover from the Council any expenses incurred by him which are not recovered from any other person. Information by Factory Inspectors (Sec. 5).—Where a Factory Inspector finds " any act, neglect, or default, in relation to any drain, water closet, earth closet, privy, ashpit, water supply, nuisance, or other matter in a factory or workshop, is punishable or remediable under the law relating to public health," but not under the Factory and Workshop Act, he shall give the Council notice in writing. Having so far explained the duties of the Council and the general scope of the Act, it becomes the duty of your Medical Officer to report on its administration. 19061 200 It is with the greatest satisfaction that one can look back to the administration of this Act in Islington, for here, unlike the majority of other places, the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1891, as well as those of the older Factory and Workshops Act, were carefully administered with the assistance of two Inspectors, one a man and one a woman, whose sole duty was to inspect workplaces where men and women were employed. Consequently when with the Act of 1901 new duties and responsibilities were cast on the Council, they found themselves in a very favourable position for executing the additional duties that devolved on them. The work of administration has been no less successfully carried out during 1906 than in preceding years, and it reflects considerable credit on every person engaged in the work, which, however, it must be noted, daily increases. Indeed, during the year it was felt that it was impossible, without the assistance of an additional Inspector, to pay the necessary attention to the homes of the outworkers and the kitchens of restaurants, and consequently on November 6th the Council appointed an additional Female Inspector whose sole duty it will be to look after these places. Inspections and Visits.—There were two Inspectors (a male and female) employed during the whole year, together with one Female Inspector from November 6th to its close, who together made 6,980 inspections and re-inspections to the several workshops and workplaces in the Borough. This entailed the necessity for serving 389 written notices on the owners and occupiers. The particulars of the places inspected were:— Factories, including Factory Laundries ... ... 329 Workshops, including workshop Laundries ... 1.977 Workplaces, not inclusive of the homes of outworkers ... ... ... ... ... ... 257 Inspection of the homes of out-workers ... ... i»435 Miscellaneous re-inspections ... ... ... 2,982 Of the notices served, 55 were with respect to factories, 226 to workshops, 8 to workplaces other than outworkers' premises, 26 premises of outworkers, while the defects found were want of cleanliness 414, want of ventilation 6, overcrowding 30, want of drainage to floors 2, insufficient sanitary accommodation 30, unsuitable, defective, or foul sanitary accommodation 184, 207 [1906 insufficient accommodation for the sexes 6, and other nuisances 386, while altogether 1,075 defects were remedied. The fact that more defects were remedied than found is explained by the circumstance that some of the nuisances discovered had not been abated at the close of last year. The complete analysis of the work of the Inspectors is set out in the several tables which accompany this part of the report. Registers.-The registers show that there are 2,166 workshops on the register, as compared with 2,309 in the preceding year. Of these 578 were workshops where men only were employed, and 845 where women only are employed, 147 were laundries, 260 were bakehouses, and 336 were restaurant kitchens. Sanitation.—The improvement of the general state of the workshops goes on apace. Latterly it may be said that the efforts of the Public Health Department have been met with much less resistance than formerly by the owners, the true significance of which is that in Islington, at all events, they have recognised the determination of the authorities, the Home Office and the Borough Council, to enforce the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act. The following table is here appended, as it shows at a glance what has been done in Islington since 1896 :— 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 Total Overcrowding 26 12 15 14 22 14 4 13 4 13 3° 167 Ventilation 14 13 2 5 4 3 5 8 11 4 3 77 Dirty rooms 311 195 109 99 217 218 231 423 630 412 448 3.293 Drains 554 458 375 313 216 177 90 50 19 15 4 2,271 W.C.'s 420 325 34i 355 411 375 154 161 165 I5I 190 3,048 Water supplies 79 41 35 20 19 13 83 54 18 38 17 4'7 Surface drains 79 109 37 5i 78 81 2 53 40 34 39 653 Cleansing.. 412 375 393 424 437 387 558 441 609 490 497 5.023 Cleanliness. —From the reports of the Inspectors it is found that there was a want of cleanliness found in 414 instances in workshops, all of which have been remedied, together with some others that had stood over at the end of the preceding year. This number compares with 550 in the preceding year. It will, therefore, be seen that there has been a slight improvement in this respect. 19061 208 Effluvium Nuisances.—No instances came under observation. Want of Air Space, Overcrowding—Overcrowding was discovered in 30 workrooms, as compared with 14 in the preceding year, and with 4 in the year 1904. On notice being given, the number of employees was in each instance reduced, and where it was necessary, cards showing the number of persons who were permitted to be employed in the particular rooms were distributed. These also stated their cubic capacity. Want of Drainage of Floors.—In only two instances was it required to call attention to this insanitary state, which almost entirely affects laundries, tripe dressers, and gut scrapers, and in each a remedy was effected. This number compares with three in the preceding year. Want of Ventilation.—In 6 cases insufficient ventilation of workrooms was discovered, which defects were put right with the addition of 4 which had stood over from the end of the preceding year. Sanitary Accommodation.—In 30 instances insufficient sanitary accommodation was discovered. In 184 cases W.C's. were found to be unsuitable, defective or foul, while in 6 cases no separate accommodation had been provided for females. At one time very few workshops in the Borough made provision for the sexes. Now, however, it is a rare thing, except in some newly occupied workshops, to discover this breach of the Factory and Workshops Act. This is due to the fact that there is no provision of the Act that has received more attention, and has been more diligently enforced, than that of suitable accommodation for women and girls ; and it has been the aim of the Public Health Department to see that it was in every way suitable, particularly with respect to the approaches, which in the older workshops were very frequently side by side with that of the men, a state of affairs which was most undesirable and inadmissible. Bakehouses.—There are on the register 260 bakehouses, to which 215 visits were paid. They were also inspected by Mr. Leggatt, who since the passing of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901, inspects them carefully every year. He made his usual inspection during the months of May and June. His visits have always had a very useful result, for they enable the Sanitary Authority to place their views with respect to the use of their bakehouses before the owners. Mr. Leggatt's report is as follows:— 209 1906 Town Hall., Upper Street, N. June 8th, 1906. Dear Sir, I have to report that I have inspected the whole of the Bakehouses in the Borough, and have found them to a very great extent in a satisfactory condition. There is no doubt that owing to the illness of Inspector West, who since last November has practically been unable to keep them under supervision, that there has been a slight falling off on the part of the occupiers to observe the conditions as to cleansing, etc., as they have done in previous years. In my opinion, if the high standard that has been reached in regard to the state of our Bakehouses is to be maintained, a more frequent inspection should be made, and I would also suggest that printed instructions should be issued to the occupiers as to the proper use of Bakehouses and the months of the year that the cleansing, etc., should be carried out. I have found ironing being done on a trough, clothes being dried in several instances in the Bakehouse, and in some cases workmen resting on the troughs. Of course, these may be looked on as small matters, but I certainly think that they should be discouraged. There still remain a large number of Bakehouses which have not been in use for several years, but as the ovens have not been bricked up, they have to be inspected for the purpose of ascertaining whether they have been used, and to do this necessitates a great many visits being paid. 1 am, Yours faithfully, JAMES R. LEGGATT, Superintendent and Chief Sanitary Inspector. With respect to his remark that there had been a slight falling off on the part of the occupiers in the observations of the conditions as to cleanliness, etc., it should be observed that owing to the illness of Inspector West during several months in the early part of the year, it was not possible to visit the bakehouses more frequently. In any case, increasing duties under the Factory and Workshops Act made it incumbent that some means should be devised for their more frequent inspection. This was effected later on in the year by relieving him of certain duties which he had previously carried out, and by the appointment of a Female Sanitary Inspector to look after the kitchens and restaurants, a work to which he had devoted considerable time. With respect to the statement that Mr. Leggatt had found several bakehouses that were used for drying clothes, it might be pointed out that there is no power under any Act of Parliament to prevent this practice. His suggestion, therefore, that printed instructions should be issued to the occupiers, is worthy of consideration. The drawback, however, is that if they were made the P 1906] 210 Council would possess no power to enforce them. Indeed the only way this could be effected would be for Parliament to amend the Factory and Workshops Act by a short Act, prohibiting the use of bakehouses for any purpose other than that of baking, and also to specify the periods at which they should be cleansed. At the same time it would be well to endow the authorities with power to deal with their state as regards the cleanliness of the troughs and vessels used in connection with the trade. Until this is done, it is impossible to prevent owners from using their bakehouses for purposes other than baking, or to keep their troughs and utensils in that state of cleanliness which is so necessary in the preparation and making of our staple food.

The names of 583 outworkers, together with their addresses, were forwarded to the other Boroughs in conformity with the Factory and Workshops Act. Altogether 1,435 inspections of outworkers' premises were made. The importance of this work is considerable, for, as Mrs. Young points out, a large number of the workers are engaged in making wearing apparel which is generally worn in the condition in which it leaves their homes. Cleanliness and thorough good sanitary conditions are therefore essential, and it is not too much to say that unless these homes were carefully and systematically inspected, most unsatisfactory conditions would prevail. It may be pointed out that in 9 instances an infectious disease was discovered in their homes, and of course in every case where the clothing 215 [1900 had been exposed to infection it was disinfected at the Council's Disinfecting Station, and at the same time the tradesman who supplied the work was notified of the fact. In reference to the work carried on at home by outworkers, Miss Brown, one of the Female Inspectors, has made some very valuable remarks in her report, which are well worthy of very careful thought and study by everyone who takes an interest in matters that affect the working classes very closely. Restaurant kitchens and places where food is prepared.—In a report which was presented to the Public Health Committee in July, the Medical Officer of Health pointed out that there were 336 restaurants and places where food was prepared and eaten in the Borough, and that it was most desirable that they should be closely inspected, but that unfortunately in Islington, in consequence of the limitation of the staff, comparatively little attention had been given to them, although such visits as had been made had undoubtedly led to improvements. He recommended that they should be visited more frequently and as this would require a very large portion of the time of an Inspector, it would be advisable to appoint one, who should be a woman, for the purpose. He, therefore, advised that another Female Inspector, who would devote her time to this work and to the inspection of the homes of outworkers, should be appointed. This recommendation was adopted by the Council, who towards the end of the year appointed Mrs. Young. It is, therefore to be hoped that much good will be effected in the course of the current year, as undoubtedly there is much scope for useful work. There were at the end of the year 147 laundries, containing 308 workrooms, on the register, as compared with 161 in the preceding year and with 193 in 1904. These figures show that there has been a considerable decrease in their numbers, which is chiefly due to the absorption of the smaller laundries by the larger establishments, in which for the most part steam power is used. They were, of course, closely inspected, and it is satisfactory to be able to report that they were found in a very fair state. They show a general improvement upon previous years. Workshops notified to H.M. Inspector.— Under section 133 of the Factory and Workshops Act it is required that the Medical Officer of Health, when he becomes aware that any woman, young child, or person is employed in a workshop to which no abstract of the Act is affixed, shall forthwith give written notice to H.M. Inspector for the district. 1900] 216 In conformity with this provision 165 workshops in which 614 females and 18 male young persons were employed, were notified.

Town Hall, Islington, n. February, 1907. To A. E. Harris, Esq., Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to submit to you a report of the work done by me during the year 1906 in connection with workplaces where women are employed. The inspections made during the year may be classified as follows:— Inspections of Factories, including Factory Laundries 78 Inspections of Workshops, including Workshop Laundries 947 (These comprise 1,558 Workrooms). Inspection of premises of Outworkers 390 Miscellaneous re-inspections and visits 1,845 Total 3,260 Register of Workshops and Laundries.—During the year 171 premises have been added to the Register, while 175 have been removed from it, thus leaving at the end of the year 992 workplaces containing 1,719 workrooms.

In many of the workshops only about half the former number of employees are now at work. This is very satisfactory from a sanitary point of view as regards possible overcrowding, but appears to suggest some radical fault in the economic system. This depression in trade has been noticeable for some time, but latterly has seemed more marked. Most of the industries visited in Islington appear to have been affected, some to a very great extent, others in a lesser degree. The occupiers of workshops attribute this state of affairs partly to foreign competition, which, they say, interferes with their means of livelihood. Many things are made abroad at a very cheap rate, and are sent here and sold for a price for which it would be impossible to produce them in England; thus underselling English goods and ruining English industry. This foreign competition appears operative both in the case of articles of inferior quality as well as in those of a better class. Thus cheap ties, mantles and boxes are sent in from abroad, while at the same time the best artificial flowers from the Continent are taking the place of our home products of the same class. Even when the goods are exactly the same price and quality, there is said to be a preference given to the foreign article in the English market. In the case of box-making, it is interesting to note that boxes can be made in Japan, carried all the way here, and sold at a cheaper rate than those manufactured in England. The alien also in England enters in open competition with the native worker, and manages to absorb a goodly share of work by offering to do it at a sum which would mean slow starvation for the English worker. In some industries the export trade seems to have largely declined; thus, in the case of tie making, where formerly large shipping orders were received, Germans, Americans, and Australians now make their own goods, and English work is principally done for the home market. The general impression that one gets from visiting workplaces and hearing the opinion of those who, through personal interest are conversant with the subject, is that England is being injured materially by foreign competition and also by the influx of foreign paupers, who, by sweating themselves and others, are enabled to undersell English labour. This depression in trade also to a certain extent affects the employment of Outworkers, as it has caused some of those workshops which remain as Domestic workshops to dispense with their indoor workers. Workrooms could not be kept open owing to the uncertainty of work, so when a busy time comes the system of employing Outworkers is adopted instead —if system it can be called. Employers are thus relieved from the burden of rent, gas, fuel, etc., which falls on the Outworkers, who, in spite of the fact that they are out of pocket for tram fares, and lose much time in fetching and carrying the work as well as in waiting for it to be given out, do not receive any better payment for the same work than an indoor hand. One striking feature of the system of employing Outworkers is the varying rate of pay given by different firms for the same work. This matter of low pay is infinitely the worst evil to which homework is liable. The homeworkers themselves can do nothing to remedy this state of affairs, for homeworkers isolated and oppressed are incapable of organization. The whole system of the employment of Outworkers requires to be regulated by legislation, determining the hours and conditions under which such work is done, and securing, if possible, a minimum wage, thus protecting the workers against themselves as well as against the employer. This has been tried in the Colonies, notably in Victoria and New Zealand with great success. Thus, instead of leaving the matter as here to the will of the individual employer, wages boards have been established there, and fair prices fixed by a committee of representatives of employer and employed. Consequently wages have been 1906] 224 raised, and a substantial improvement effected in the condition of the homeworker. It appears desirable also that the employer should be made responsible, at least in some degree, for the conditions under which his work is done, instead of, as at present, shifting the entire responsibility on to the shoulders of the Outworkers. It would undoubtedly be difficult to legislate for these conditions, but that it can be done has been proved by the success attending like measures of reform in other countries. A Bill to establish Wage Boards has already been introduced, and it is hoped that this may eventually become law. During the year 138 Workshops, Laundries and Factories in which the abstract of the Factory Act was not affixed or which had not been already visited were forwarded to H.M. Inspector for the district. The majority of those starting new workshops do not appear to realize their legal responsibility in the matter of notifying to the Home Office the fact that they are employing protected persons. This notification in some cases is purposely omitted in order to escape the attention of the authorities, but in most cases appears to be due rather to carelessness or to an imperfect knowledge of the law. In accordance with section 107 of the Factory and Workshop Act, the names and addresses of 567 Outworkers working for Islington employers while residing outside the Borough have been forwarded to their respective districts. The Sanitary defects found in connection with the workplaces where women are employed may be summarized as follows:— Overcrowding.—Overcrowding was found in 25 workrooms during the year. The number of employees was in each case reduced on notice being given. 364 workroom cards were distributed stating the cubic capacity and the number allowed in each room. Cleanliness.—181 workrooms were found in a dirty condition during the year, and 183 have been cleansed. Ventilation.—Additional means of ventilation have been provided in 5 workplaces which were found to be insufficiently ventilated. While in other respects the condition of work places seems to be gradually improving, there does not appear to be any marked improvement in the matter of ventilation. Even where there is an ample supply of means of ventilation, there is often no attempt made to use the existing means. The employee seems most to blame for this state of affairs, as frequently the employer is anxious as far as possible to meet the wishes of the authorities in this respect. Many of the workers who appear not to have even elementary ideas as to the advantages of fresh air, refuse to have the windows open; consequently they remain closed, unless an Inspector happens to call. The subject of fresh air and ventilation in its relation to health might with advantage be made a very special subject of study in our elementary schools, as the want of fresh air must necessarily affect unfavourably the health and consequently the other conditions of the worker. Sanitary accommodation.—Twenty-one instances of premises having either insufficient accommodation or want of separate accommodation were found during the year and have, with accompanying defects, been dealt with by Inspector West. Miscellaneous defects. In addition to the matters already mentioned, 182 miscellaneous defects were found. Of these, 145 had been remedied before the end of the year. Two Statutory Notices and 90 Intimation Notices have been served during the year. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, JOSEPHINE J. BROWN, Sanitary Inspector of Workshops. Table CXX.

Town Hall, Upper Street, Islington, N. March 14 , 1907. T. A. E. Harris, Esq. Medical Officer of Health. Sir, Herewith I have pleasure in submitting a report of the work done from November 6th, when I commenced my duties, to the end of the year 1906. During this period the whole of my time was occupied in visiting the homes of Outworkers residing in the Borough. The total number on the register at the end of the year was 1,940, viz.:— Reported by firms trading in the Borough 1,102 Names and addresses received from other Boroughs 838 1,940 583 names and addresses were forwarded to other Boroughs (567 by Miss Brown), leaving a total of 1,357 outworkers residing and working in this Borough. These figures represent the total number of names notified during the second half of the year, viz., those sent in August (as required by the Home Office); therefore not being in any way duplicated by the February lists for the first half of the year, they may be taken as an (approximately) correct estimate of the actual number of persons thus employed. The following is a list of their various occupations:— The making of wearing apparel 1,779 „ „ furniture and upholstery 7 ,, „ paper and card boxes 140 ,, ,, brushes 10 ,, ,, electro-plate 4 1,940 That so large a porportion of these workers are engaged in the making of wearing apparel, which is generally worn in the condition in which it leaves the home of the outworker (without washing, or any sort of cleansing), points to the absolute necessity of cleanliness in the conditions of their workrooms, especially as these rooms are frequently used as bed and living rooms by the family; but, unfortunately, the scale of wages paid to this class of workers is so low; and they are often compelled to work so many hours to gain a Q 1906] 226 mere subsistence, that attention to the common rules of cleanliness in their homes and persons becomes a matter of secondary consideration in the struggle to earn a bare living. During the period under report:— 512 visits have been made to the homes of the Outworkers on the register; Of these, 77 were found to have removed, or were not known at the address given. 17 workrooms were dirty. 2 sanitary conveniences dirty and defective. 2 workrooms overcrowded. 1 house without a dustbin; and 9 miscellaneous defects were found. 140 of the premises visited though not sufficiently dirty, or badly ventilated to necessitate the service of a written notice, were unsatisfactory, either through want of cleanliness in the general conditions, vitiated atmosphere, or the neglect of personal care- in the workers. 2 cases of overcrowding have been abated. 1 dustbin supplied. 2 sanitary conveniences repaired. 3 miscellaneous defects remedied. 12 intimation notices have also been served; and 16 names and addresses of outworkers residing in other Boroughs have been forwarded to their respective districts.

Outworkers.—In accordance with Section 107 of the Factories and Workshops Act, 1901, I have during the year sent through you to the Medical Officers of Health of the Metropolitan Boroughs, the names and addresses of 523 outworkers who reside in the various Boroughs of London and suburbs, and who work for tradespeople in Islington. I have also forwarded the names and addresses of several outworkers to their respective districts which have been sent to this borough in error. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, GEORGE WEST, Sanitary Inspector of Workshops. INSPECTION OF HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. There were at the end of the year 991 houses on the unofficial register, which is the number that were on the register in 1905. The term " unofficial register" has been used advisedly, because under the new by-laws which came into force on 6th August, 1906, it is no longer incumbent on the local authority to keep a register, as these by-laws apply equally to every tenemented house in Table CXXI.

In any of the following cases a lodging-house shall be exempt from the operation of these by-laws; that is to say:— (а) Where the tenant himself resides on the premises, and the letting by such tenant is to not more than one lodger. (b) Where the rent or charge payable by each lodger occupying not more than one room, and exclusive of any charge for the use by the lodger of any furniture, is at the rate of not less than four shillings and sixpence per week, and such room is occupied by not more than two persons. (c) Where the rent or charge payable by each lodger occupying not more than one room, and inclusive of any charge for the use by the lodger of any furniture, is at the rate of not less than six shillings per week, and such room is occupied by not more than two persons. (d) Where the rent or charge payable by each lodger occupying two or more rooms, and exclusive of any charge for the use by the lodger of any furniture, is at the rate of not less than seven shillings and sixpence per week. (e) Where the rent or charge payable by each lodger occupying two or more rooms, and inclusive of any charge for the use by the lodger of any furniture, is at the rate of not less than ten shillings per week. Nevertheless it is not intended, to keep all the houses to which the by-laws would apply under constant and systematic supervision, for that would be an absolute impossibility without enormously increasing the staff, and, therefore, the Public Health Committee decided that all the houses on the old register should be inspected as before, and that other houses, which were known to be systematically neglected by their owners, or were a source of frequent complaint should be added to the list. This is now being done, and it is hoped that by the close of the current year, many more houses than formerly will be under frequent supervision. There is one great advantage in the new by-laws, and that is that every tenemented house, let as described, can be dealt with by the district inspectors, when they find insanitary conditions which come within their scope, whereas 230 1906] formerly they were powerless to apply them unless the houses had been first registered by the Council, which was a cumbrous and dilatory method, and, therefore one that was never practised. On the resignation of Inspector Rolfe, one of the District Inspectors, Mr. J. J. Jordan, who was an Inspector engaged in the inspection of houses let in lodgings, was transferred at his own request to the vacated district, and Mr. T. H. Hancock was appointed to fill his place. During the year 12,185 visits were paid to these houses, of which 5,787 were to those in the northern part of the borough, and 6,398 to those in its southern part; while each house on an average received 14 visits. The houses in Campbell Road continue to be the most difficult to deal with, because of the character of the tenants, to many of whom dirty and insanitary surroundings are matters of utter indifference. It is no wonder therefore, that the Inspector (Bridel) is constantly in evidence there. At one time there was great difficulty in dealing with the owners of the properties in this road, but it is satisfactory to find that latterly they are much more amenable to reason and are less unwilling to execute necessary works, although still there remains much to be desired. At the same time it must be admitted that the tenants would try the patience of any man and that to many of them cleanliness is an unknown quantity Nuisances Abated. - Altogether 2,211 separate nuisances were abated, in the course of which it was necessary to execute the following works Drains constructed 27 „ repaired 76 Traps fixed 58 W.C.'s—extra provided 10 „ amended 51 „ supplied with water 129 Dust bins provided . 99 „ repaired or covered 7 Surface drains and yard pavement constructed or relaid 60 Water supply—cisterns provided 2 „ „ repaired and cleansed 81 „ provided 3 Houses—repaired 81 „ cleansed and limewashed 384 „ ventilated 4 Overcrowding abated 45 231 [1906 HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS.

There are fourteen inspectors engaged in the general inspection of the borough, to each of whom there is an area allotted on which an average of more than 24,000 persons dwell. This is a large charge, and is not always recollected when persons discuss the number of Inspectors employed in Islington. There are many towns in England where with populations of such a size at least two Inspectors are employed. It can be affirmed that their numbers are none too great for the important, and let it be added ever increasing, duties which they have to perform, as may be gathered from the fact that during the year they made over 83,000 visits for one purpose or another. Inspections and Visits.—9,134 houses were inspected, entailing 62,663 subsequent calls, so that altogether 71,797 visits were made, in addition to which 11,371 visits were entailed in inspecting ice-cream factories, dairies, and milkshops, stables and yards, manure depots, and railway sidings, houses for which Inland Revenue exemption certificates had been applied, new houses as to their water supply, smoke nuisances, etc. An important part of their duty, too, is the enquiries respecting infectious disease, which it may be said is sometimes very trying, because no matter what the ordinary work for the day may be the enquiry respecting these diseases must be made so that the Public Elementary Schools, and, indeed, all schools, may be apprised of infection among their scholars, or in their homes, at the very earliest moment. The following return gives a synopsis of the nature and number of the visits of the Inspectors:— House to House Inspections 2,088 Other Inspections of Dwelling Houses 7,046 Re-inspections and calls made 62,665 Infectious Diseases (Notifiable) 2,275 Infectious Diseases (Notified by Schools) 4,135 Butcher's Shops, Stalls, etc., on Saturday evenings 6,240 Ice-Cream Shops and Factories 458 Dairies and Milkshops 2,239 Stables and Yards 6,517 Manure Depots .... Workshops—re Drains 1,004 Certificates under Customs and Inland Revenue Acts 53 Water Certificates Samples under Sale of Food and Drugs Act - 44 Registered Lodging Houses 2 Smoke observations 783 233 [1906 3.936 intimations with respect to nuisances were served by the inspectors, of which 3,805 were served personally and 131 by post. In 312 instances it became necessary to serve, by order of the Public Health Committee, statutory notices, of which 82 were served personally and 230 by registered post. Improvements Effected.. The following list of the principal improvement, effected speaks for itself as to the character and utility of the work that has been carried out, and it contrasts favourably with the record of previous years :— Houses. Dirty 800 Damp 209 Out of Repair 303 Water Closets. Foul 663 Without water supply 224 With deficient water supply 219 Improperly constructed 631 Defective 426 Stopped 100 Improperly situated 25 Insufficient external ventilation 49 Insufficient in number 103 Soil Pipes. Defective 156 Unventilated 165 Improperly ventilated 163 Yards. Improperly paved 573 Dirty . 76 Undrained 31 Drains. Foul 51 Defective 1,104 Choked or stopped 217 Unventilated . 339 Cesspools. Abolished 19 234 1906] Overcrowding. Abated . 91 Underground Rooms. Abolished for sleeping . . 37 Other Nuisances 8.687 Total nuisances . 15.461 Cesspools.—These are occasionally found, and are of course abolished, unless there is some strong reason for a contrary action. During the year under consideration 23 were discovered and filled up. Overcrowding.—In 91 instances overcrowding was detected, which is the lowest number for several years. It compares with in cases in 1905 and 138 in 1904. In addition to this, the Inspectors of Houses Let in Lodgings had 45 cases abated, so that altogether 125 were dealt with. Underground Rooms.—The disuse of 37 underground rooms was ordered, as against 40 in 1905, 57 in 1904, 25 in 1903, 48 in 1902, and 57 in 1901. Houses closed.—No house was closed as being unfit for human habitation. Manure Depots.—The manure depots were inspected on 141 occasions and were found in a satisfactory condition. The depot at the Great Eastern Railway siding, Upper Holloway, was also carefully inspected by the Medical Officer of Health on several occasions in consequence of complaints received from the Yerbury Road London County Council School, but he was unable to detect any nuisance with which the Council could deal. It is hardly too much to say that this siding is kept in a most admirable manner and that its state reflects credit on those in charge of it. Regent's Canal.—This canal, which in the past has given so much trouble, was kept under observation during the year, but it is a satisfaction to note that no complaint was made against its state by the Inspectors or by the public generally. Offensive Trades.—These trades fortunately are few in number, only 7 being on the register. They include 3 tripe dressers, 2 gut scrapers, 1 tallow 235 [1906 melters and i knacker's yard, and were most carefully inspected from time to time by Inspector Wilkinson, who paid 87 visits to them Only one of them offended, viz., the tallow melting establishment, Pleasant Grove, York Road, where it was found that noxious fumes were allowed to escape into the air instead of being consumed by passing through fire. Smoke Nuisances.—783 observations were made of smoke issuing from the following factory chimneys : — smoke observations.

Before these were given it became necessary for the Inspectors to make 420 visits. The granting of these certificates effects a very useful purpose, for it ensures (a) that the service pipe shall be buried in the ground to a depth of 2 feet 6 inches; (b) that where it passes through an open area or through cellars it shall be amply protected from frost; (c) that a draw.off tap for dietetic purposes shall be fixed to the main pipe in a suitable position, and (d) that the storage cistern shall be placed in an easily accessible position, and shall be of sufficient capacity for the requirements of the people living in the house.

There can be no doubt that the removal of dust from the houses in Islington is performed in a very satisfactory manner as judged by the number of applications made for its removal during the year 1906, in which period they were only 58 as compared with 89 in the preceding year. This is a very different tale from that which prevailed in 1891, and, indeed, up to 1896, for in the former year 10,138 requests were made to empty ashpits and dustbins, and in 1896, 4,245. Thenceforward the numbers rapidly decreased, so that in 1897 there were only 312, and in 1898, 303; and so on until in 1906 there were as few as 58. The following statement is of interest as showing the improvement that has been effected in the removal of dust since 1891. Applications to Remove Dust.

Dust Receptacles provided.—During the year 772 receptacles were provided under notice by the owners of houses, while 116 were repaired. R 1906] 212 Table CXXVI.

Paupers relieved—The average weekly number of paupers relieved in Islington during 1906 was 9,069, as contrasted with 9,224 in 1905, with 8,086 in 1904 and with 8,004 I9°3. The number is also 1,702 above the average of the 10 years 1896-1905. It can only be said that the return is satisfactory in so far that it does not exceed that of the preceding year. The average number of paupers relieved in each year since 1896 has been as follows:— 1896 6,436 per week relieved. 1897 6,486 „ 1898 6,635 1899 6,854 1900 6,956 1901 7,327 1902 7,768 1903 8,004 1904 8,086 „ 1905 9,224 Average 7,367 „ ^ 1906 9,069 Indoor Paupers—The average weekly number of indoor paupers, inclusive of adults and children, was 4,189, as compared with 4,295 in 1905 and 3,622 in 1904, and with an average of 3,469 in the 10 years 1896-1905. (vide Table CXXVII.) Outdoor Paupers.—These numbered 4,878, which is a deciease of 51 on the return of the preceding year, when on an average 4,929 were relieved weekly. In 1904 the number was 4,464, and the weekly average for the 10 years 1896-1905, 3,898. The number of adults relieved was 3,335 as against 3,302 in 1905, so that there was an increase of 33. With respect to children under 16 years of age, 1,545 were relieved on an average every week, whereas in 1905 they numbered 1,627. The average weekly number in the preceding 10 years had been 1,355. Vagrants.—The number of vagrants relieved has averaged only 12 per week, as against 58 in 1905 and 65 in 1904. The number was also 14 less than the weekly average of 10 years. Children Boarded-out.—There were 134 children on an average boarded out during the year, as against 126 in the preceding year, 122 in 1904, and an average of 120 in the ten years 1896—1905.

The revelations in the public press respecting the canning industries of the United States, especially in Chicago, naturally caused a very great alarm throughout the United Kingdom, because this country consumes a very great quantity of the canned goods prepared in that country, and at the first meeting of the Council after the revelations were made, the Medical Officer of Health made the following statements " I am glad of an opportunity of being able to say that there is nothing in Islington, so far as can be discovered, w hich would cause any uneasiness to the public mind. " So far as tinned or canned goods are concerned, I may state that there is power to inspect or seize any food products, whether canned or not, which might be open to suspicion, but it must be clear to the average mind that it would be almost impossible for an Inspector to enter a shop where these goods are sold and to demand that he should be allowed to open them for examination unless he had the very greatest reason for supposing that they were unsound. Nearly all kinds of food products in an unsound state are from time to time brought to me by the public when they think they have been sold something that was unsound or unwholesome, but it is a strange fact that during 14 years I can only bring to mind one instance in which canned meat was brought to the office for examination. " This seems to show that there has not been much unsound meat of this character sold in the Borough. " With respect to the canned goods manufactured in Islington, I may point out that the trade is practically confined to three firms, two of whom are in a comparatively small way of business. Their premises arc regularly visited, at least once a fortnight, and in no instance have they been discovered preparing food that was unfit for human consumption, and I may add that their trade has been conducted under the most cleanly conditions. There are also 4 places in which tripe is prepared, and these have been inspected once in every two or three weeks throughout the year. The proprietors of these places take the greatest care as to the character of the food they deal in, and during last year one of them, not thinking it quite up to the mark, sent for the Meat Inspector to ask him his opinion as to its soundness. " Samples of Lard have been from time to time examined analytically in the Borough, but they have invariably been found to be pure. Chemical analysis, however, cannot show whether it was the product of diseased animals, 251 \itm and, indeed, I doubt il this had been so whether the germs could have survived the ordeal of its manfacture owing to the great heat which it undergoes in the process, " I would like to state also that no less than 10,000 visits were paid to the Restaurant, Bakehouses, Slaughterhouses, Butchers' Shops, fish Shops and Cowhouses in the Borough during the year, from which il will be perceived that the inspection of the places where food is prepared has Ixeen unremitting, " In reference to butcher's meat, I might remind the Council that I have reported to them in my annual reports that every year a considerable quantity of meat is seized and destroyed by the Council's Meat Inspector, and this amounted in 5 years to over 17J tons, an amount which shows that active inspection is carried out. Of course, this quantity is not to be compac d with that seized in the neighbouring Borough of Finsbury, nor yet with that of the City of London, in both of which districts there are large wholesale markets and wholesale merchants who sell meat in enormous quantities, but it is nevertheless a very large weight when the different conditions of the sale of meat in Islington are taken into consideration. " Taking all these matters into account, I think that Islington has every reason to be satisfied with the manner in which its food products are looked after." At the time of the scare a special inspection was made in Islington, as indeed was the case in every borough throughout the country, of the places where food was prepared, of the food before preparation, and of the manufactured articles themselves, as well as of the processes by which they were made. So far as Islington was concerned, nothing was discovered, but on the contrary the shops and factories were found in a very fair condition, while the food stuffs were of good quality, some indeed being exceptionally good. Just after this Inspection had been made the Local Government Board sent out the following circular letter signed by Dr. G. S. Buchanan. Local Government Board. Office of Inspector of Foods, etc., 50, Parliament Street, S.W. June 19th, 1906. Dear Sir, I understand that in many administrative districts under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, samples of canned and preserved meats are 1906] 252 being sent to the Public Analyst, in view of the recent events in the United States. I am anxious to utilise the opportunity to collect information as to use of preservatives and colouring matters in the foods in question. The presence of preservatives and colours in such foods as sausages, potted shrimps, etc., has of course often been ascertained, but the condition of certain other meat products, whether of home or foreign manufacture, in regard to preservatives is less clearly established ; and there seems to be special need for information as to presence or absence of preservatives in "canned," tinned or other foods which are hermetically sealed, in view of the indication that may be afforded that the meat was not fresh at the time of " canning." Accordingly I am inviting Public Analysts by letter to supply me with facts as to preservatives and colouring matters in any meat products which they have lately examined or may shortly be receiving. In order that this information may be as complete as possible I would be much obliged if you would kindly arrange to transmit to the Analyst, in regard of samples lately collected, or shortly to be collected, full particulars as to each sample, viz.: (a) the description of the article purchased, (6) the nature of the receptacle, if any, in which it was purchased (hermetically sealed can or tin, covered pot, etc.), (c) the name of the manufacturer, brand of goods or any other statements on the label. I may state here that it is not intended to make published use of any name, etc., by which individual firms may be identified. I would like to make a further suggestion regarding samples which may shortly be collected, namely, that in the case of meat products in cans, tins, etc., it would often be best that the whole sample as purchased should be sent to the analyst. This proceeding would prevent prosecutions being instituted in the case of such samples, but on the other hand the principle point in many of these cases, alike for local and central authority, is knowledge of the facts, before questions of prosecution are considered. By not dividing the sample the analyst has more material for examination; he can if he desires, make bacteriological examinations to see if the contents of the can, etc., are sterile, and he is better acquainted with the nature of the material he is testing. If in ordinary circumstances arrangements regarding sampling under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts do not come under your direction, I 268 [1906 would be glad if you would kindly forward this request to the Officer or Officers of the Council with whom such arrangements rest. I am, Yours faithfully, G. S. BUCHANAN. The Medical Officer of Health, Islington. In consequence of this circular, a number of samples were procured in various parts of the Borough and were submitted to Dr. F. L. Teed, the Public Analyst for Islington for examination, with the result that nothing of a deleterious character was discovered. The following are the particulars of these examinations set out in tabular form:— Foods. Extraneous Colouring Matters. Preservatives. Ptomaines. Bacteriological Examination.

" Beef Pork and Beans Bloater Paste ( Insuffi■j for ( Exam. 1906] 254 A very full report on "Foods, Preservatives, etc." was also presented by the Medical Officer of Health to the Public Health Committee, who reported to the Council as follows:— We have had under consideration an exhaustive report from the Medical Officer of Health on the subject of "Foods," copies of which we have caused to be circulated amongst the members of the Council. It will be seen from that report that the Medical Officer of Health makes important recommendations with regard to the use of preservatives and colouring matters and to inspection with the object of securing better protection for the public against the consumption of unsound, diseased, or unwholesome food, and we are in accord with these recommendations. We therefore recommend. (a) That the Local Government Board be asked to introduce legislation at an early date:— 1. To secure that all meat, including canned food, shall be inspected on entry to this country, and that the importation of "pricked " cans shall be prohibited. 2. To enable sanitary authorities to deal with the uncleanliness of vessels, machines, instruments. appliances and furniture used in the preparation, the cooking and the sale of food. 3. To carry out the recommendations of the Departmental Committee on preservatives. 4. To secure the licensing of milkshops and dairies. (b) That the London County Council be asked to seek parliamentary powers to erect public slaughterhouses for the slaughtering of animals intended for consumption in London, and to build stations at which all meat entering London could be officially examined. These recommendations having been considered by the Council were adopted. Soon afterwards the Chicago scare passed away, but undoubtedly it has left behind it a strong impression that American canned goods are to be avoided, notwithstanding the fact that the United States Government let it be known throughout the world that in future the very greatest watchfulness would be exhibited in Chicago and elsewhere over the manufactured food products. Food Destroyed.—During the year the Inspector condemned 2 tons 1 cwt. 1 qr. 2 lbs. food stuffs, the particulars of which, quarter by quarter, are set out in the following statement:— 255 [1906 1st Quarter. cwts. qrs. lbs.

SlaughterHouses.—These numbered 39 at the close of the year, and to them were paid 2,240 visits, during which time 32,994 animals which had been slaughtered came under inspection. This number was 79 below that of the animals killed in 1905. The figures for the past three years are given for the sake of contrast in the following table: — Animals killed. 1904. 1905. 1906. Oxen 2,360 2,195 2,172 Cows 4 17 - Calves 154 127 143 Sheep 32,973 30,686 30,668 Pigs 25 48 11 35,516 33,073 32,994 The most remarkable feature about this return is that not a single cow was killed in an Islington slaughterhouse during 1906. During the previous three years the slaughter of old cows had been gradually declining, although at one time a very large number was dealt with, as the following figures obtained from the Inspector's reports will show:— 1899 402 were killed. 1900 668 „ 1901 440 ” (six months). 1902 498 „ 1903 173 ” 1904 4 ” 1905 17 ” 1906 - ” 257 {1906 Nearly all these animals were slaughtered in a private slaughter-house at Roman Road, and were very carefully inspected both by the former Meat Inspector, Mr. Young, and by his successor, Mr. Wilkinson, with the result that many, either wholly or in part, were seized as being unfit for human food. The strictness of the inspection by no means pleased the parties who sent these cows for slaughter and the result has been that so far as Islington is concerned the trade has ceased. This is not a matter for regret. It would be, however, of considerable interest to discover where they are now killed and how they are dealt with. It may be noted that the regulations laid down for the guidance of Meat Inspectors by the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis were those which were followed by the Inspectors in dealing with these animals, so that no undue or unfair examination was made. Inspector Wilkinson in his report also alludes to the decrease in the total number of animals slaughtered in Islington from 44,785 in 1902 to 32,994 in 1906, a decrease of 11,791, which he, with a thorough knowledge of the meat trade, ascribes partly to the fact that there are now fewer animals slaughtered locally for the wholesale market, whilst also there is a decreased prejudice against the use of foreign meat, whether killed at the port of importation, or cold or frozen meat brought from the United States, from the Argentine Republic, or from New Zealand.

Total 39 Slaughter-Houses 259 [1906 Butchers Shops and Shops where Food is sold.—These include, in addition to the butchers shops and fish shops, other places where foods such as preserved meats and sausages are sold or prepared for sale, as well as shops, street stalls, and similar places, where perishable food-stuffs are exposed for sale. They have been carefully and systematically inspected during the year and as many as 6,968 visits have been paid to them. A fall list of the foods that were di-covered to be unfit for food is set out in table B of Inspector Wilkinson's report, and they include 26 pigs heads, 2 pigs carcases and various quantities of beef, mutton, pork, as well as various cooked meats. There were also rabbits, bacon, eggs, margarine and cheese included in the list. Cowhouses.—These numbered 9 at the end of the year, which is the same number as existed in the preceding year, although five years ago there were four more. During the twelve months under review there was an average of 93 cows producing milk in the Borough, but the Inspector has estimated that this number shows a reduction of fully 29 per cent. in five years. If one were satisfied with the inspection of cowsheds, and places where the milk of cows is kept, and that they were rigidly inspected and kept scrupulously clean, in the country, it would not be a matter of regret that the cowsheds as well as the number of cows had grown fewer in Islington, for of course the ideal place, and the natural place, for a cow is in the country; but in view of the fact that many rural authorities do not fulfil the obligations cast on them by the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, it is regretable that the numbers should decrease, for so long as they were kept under observation in Islington, so long could the public be assured of a comparatively pure supply of milk. The administration of the law respecting cowsheds and the keeping of cows has been so frequently brought under the notice of the Local Government Board that the President not long since was enabled to announce that regulations are now in force in all but 340 out of some 1,800 urban and rural districts. It is improbable, however, that they will be largely enforced by the rural authorities, recollecting that their members are for the most part farmers engaged in producing milk, and who themselves would be liable to be dealt with by the authorities of which they are members. S 2 1906] 260 The proper and only course to adopt would be to transfer to the County Councils from these authorities the administration of the Order and the regulations made under its provisions. Until this is done there can be little hope of a pure, as distinguished from an unadulterated, supply of milk for London or the large towns. Not long since the Medical Officer of Health, being in the country within 3 miles of London, was invited by a farmer to inspect his cows, which were, he stated, of a special breed, most excellent animals in their way, and good producers of milk both as to quantity and quality. He was taken to the cowshed, which to his horror he found to be at least three to four inches deep with filth, while the walls were splashed all over with cow dung, and the flanks and teats of the cows themselves were in an abominable state. Under these circumstances he contented himself with viewing the animals from the door of the byre.

Public Health Department, Town Hall, UPPER Street, N. April 29th, 1907. To A. E. Harris, Esq., Medical Ojficer of Health. Dear Sir, I have pleasure in submitting the following particulars respecting my duties for the year ending December 29th, 1906. The number of slaughter-houses has remained unchanged during the year and now stands at 39, but some of them are very seldom used for the purpose for which they are licensed, although the bye-laws and regulations are fairly well observed. To these 2,245 visits have been paid, and I found that as a whole they have been well conducted, although in three instances I suspected that breaches of the bye-laws (i.e., allowing the blood of animals to enter the drain) had taken place and warnings were given. Several minor defects were also found during the annual visits paid prior to the renewal of licences, such as defective joints or broken concrete in the floors of the slaughterhouses or pounds, and these were promptly remedied on your sending official letters to the respective licensees. The number of animals slaughtered during the year was as follows :— Oxen Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Total. 2,172 Nil 143 30,668 11 = 32,994 If these figures are compared with those of the year 1902—which was the first year of my official connection with this Borough—it will be found that there has been a decrease of 11,791 animals slaughtered in the Islington private slaughter-houses during the year 1906, as compared with that year, which works out at a reduction of 26.3 per cent. during the five years. for the purpose of comparison I submit below the number of animals of different kinds slaughtered during the two years under consideration, from which it will be seen that the reduction consisted of 25.2 per cent of sheep and lambs, 26.7 of calves, 27.5 per cent. of oxen, 84.7 of pigs, and 100 per cent. of cows. Sheep Oxen Cows Calves and Pigs Total Lambs. Year 1902 2,996 498 195 41,024 72 = 44,785 Year 1906 2,172 Nil 143 30,668 11 = 32,994 824 498 52 10,356 61 = 11,791 This reduction is very considerable, even taking into account the fact that the number of slaughter-houses have been reduced from 44 to 39 in that period, and it is no doubt owing 1906] 262 to a multiplicity of circumstances; one reason being that there are fewer animals slaughtered for the wholesale market than there was previously in Islington, whilst there is no doubt that the prejudice against foreign meat is dwindling down considerably, not only of that which is killed at the port of debarkation in this country, but also of the chilled beef which is imported from the United States of America and the Argentine Republic, and also of the frozen mutton and lamb (especially the latter) imported from New Zealand. Hut the most marked reduction is that of the number of cows killed, which has been brought to nil. This is undoubtedly due to a regular and systematic inspection within the borough, as you are well aware that the prevalence of disease in cows is considerably in excess of that in oxen, and therefore the rigid supervision has been the cause of their displacement. Proof of this will be seen by the amount of diseased carcases and organs condemned in the former year as compared with the latter, although there has been no relaxation in the supervision over the animals slaughtered, which have been of excellent quality generally and remarkably free from disease. Only five cases of tuberculosis were detected, two of which were in an incipient form over the lung pleura, whilst in two others the disease was of a localised character, the remaining case being of a generalised form, necessitating the rejection of the entire carcase and all organs, which was a somewhat serious loss to the butcher, who had doubtless purchased it at a full market price without any suspicion of its diseased condition. Other abnormal conditions found in individual organs or carcases will also be found in the table below. TABLE A. No. Description of Animals. Extent of Disease or Affection. Nature of Disease.

I ascertained, however, in the former part of the year that a rather large quantity of pigs' heads were being regularly consigned from a firm of bacon curers in the country to a preserved meat factory within the borough, and fearing that there might not be sufficient inspection over them at the place of slaughter I gave special attention to these consignments tor a short period, resulting in the detection of a number of tuberculous heads and the ultimate prosecution of the consignors, who appeared at the Clerkenwell Police Court and endeavoured to prove that they had no guilty knowledge of the diseased condition of the heads in question, and that each one was carefully examined before being sent out. It transpired, however, that the person who had been held responsible for such examination was not well versed in the detection of the disease, although latterly it was evident that some attempt had been made to discover whether or not disease existed in the lymphatic glands, but the glands most commonly affected had escaped notice. The magistrate, having regard to a long-established good repute of the firm, accepted their defence, and ordered them to pay the costs of the proceedings, which were fixed at £5 7s. It is pleasing to report that although considerable quantities of pigs heads have since been consigned to the same place, only two have been detected which were tuberculous, and these only in a very slight degree. Two butchers were prosecuted during the year for exposing and depositing for the purpose of sale meat which was unsound and unfit for human consumption by reason of its decomposed condition, and they were at the Clerkenwell Police Court fined £5 and 2s. costs and £10 and £2 2s. costs respectively. On one occasion I found several pieces of pork from a small pig which had evidently suffered from hydremia, rendering the meat, in my opinion, unfit for human consumption on account of its impoverished condition. The meat was formally seized, and after being submitted to you, was condemned at the Clerkenwell Police Court, and on the circumstances being reported to the Public Health Committee they decided to take no action. 1 he detection and disposition of other unsound food-stuffs during the year are fully set forth in the Table B of this report. Cowsheds.—With respect to cowsheds, I have to report that there are now only 9 (containing 97 cows) on the register, as compared with 13 five years ago; whilst a comparison of the number of cows kept within the Borough shows a reduction of nearly 29 per cent. during that period. This is no doubt owing to the fact that Milk Purveyors find that a supply of country milk can be obtained at a less cost than by keeping their own cows, and that their business can thus be carried on with less capital and risk. From a public health standpoint this feature presents two different aspects. On the one hand, a supply of milk produced under more natural conditions where the cows can graze in the open several months of the year, is preferable to that produced by artificial feeding in a shed from which the cows never emerge from year to year. Yet, on the other hand, there is ample proof that in very many rural districts the sanitary surroundings and filthy condition of cows kept for the production of milk when housed during the winter months are such as would not be tolerated in a London cowshed. In support of this statement I may mention that nearly all the cows which come from the country to London sheds during winter and early spring are in a very dirty condition, having layers of excreta—which have taken weeks to form—dried on their butts, flanks and udders, which can only be removed with difficulty and perseverance. 1906] 264 During the year i paid 114 visits to the nine cowsheds, and generally speaking they have been well kept. Owing, however, to the indifference of a cowman I had on two occasions to complain of the infrequency of thoroughly cleansing the floor, by which cows' udders and adjacent parts became fouled. As a consequence the cowman was discharged and better results have followed. Only one case of disease of the udder was detected during the year, and this was notified to the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council and referred to their Veterinary Inspector. Offensive Trades.—These comprise 3 tripe dressers, 2 gut scrapers, and 1 tallow melter, and have received 87 visits, and with the exception of the last named the businesses have been satisfactorily carried on. This was a constant source of trouble and complaint during the hot weather owing to the escape into the external air of obnoxious fumes from the melting fat combined with other decomposing animal matter, although the process is supposed to be carried on in sealed chambers. The knacker's yard has been visited on 46 occasions, and has been found from time to time in good sanitary condition, and no complaint has been received in regard to it. The amount of meat and other foodstuffs condemned during the year was as follows:— Tons. Cwts. Qrs. lbs. Diseased meat and organs from slaughter-houses as per Table "A" 13 1 25 Diseased and unsound meat and other foodstuffs from shops and factories condemned as per Table "B" 1 7 3 5 Tons 2 112 As compared with that of the year 1902 the amount under table "A" shows a reduction of 2 tons 9 cwts. 1 qr. 27 lbs., whilst that under table "B" shows an increase of 12 cwts. 3 qrs. 13 lbs.

The greater number may be said to be no better nor worse than similar places throughout the metropolis. The majority, too, are places from which milk should not be sold owing to the unsuitability of the premises and to the character of the other goods sold in them, but so long as the regulations made under the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order, and, indeed, the Order itself fail to give power to prevent any huckster, who thinks he will, sell milk, so long will it be more or less liable to contamination. A milkshop should be a place entirely set apart for the sale of milk, and if anything else is sold it should be only dairy produce, such as butter and eggs. It should have hard cement or tiled floors and walls, and as little furniture, shelving or places on which dust could rest as possible, so that it could be easily swilled down with water. It is said that such dairies would not pay. Possibly that is so at present, but if places intended for the sale of milk had to conform to proper regulations before being licensed, and they ought only to be occupied subject to an annual license, then they would be remunerative, for very many, indeed most, shops from which milk is now sold would cease to sell milk, and then people would be forced to deal at them. Many of the people who now sell milk over the counter say that they sell only a few pints, and only do so to oblige their customers who come to them for soap, candles, bacon, sugar, tea, and the like articles, so that it would be no hardship on them to cease its sale. There is no doubt that much of the milk sold at these hucksters or general shops, subject as it is to dust and to the effluvia from the various food and other stuffs sold in them, speedily turns sour, especially if brought into a close ill-ventilated living room, and is, therefore, entirely unfitted for the feeding of infants, the milk for whom should always be above reproach. The time was when this was not of so much consequence, for the child was invariably reared on its mother's breast, but now that such a large number of the wives of the working classes do not suckle their offspring, it is a matter of the greatest concern. The sooner, therefore, powers are given to Local Authorities to require suitable places for the sale of milk, constructed as stated above, the better it will be for every person who is compelled to use milk that is bought at them. Bakehouses.—These have been dealt with in Part IV. of the Report, in connection with the Factories and Workshops Act, vide page 208. Kitchens of Restaurants and Eating Houses.—These have also been dealt with in Part IV. of this Report. 1906] 268 Places where Ice Creams are made.—The Public Health Department have now cognizance of 230 places where these comestibles are made, as compared with 230 in 1905, and 234 in 1904. They were all visited during the year; but in only one or two instances were the ingredients kept in unsuitable places. The provisions of the London County Council General Powers Act (1902) are not sufficiently strong to completely prevent their contamination in the course of their preparation, or to control the conditions under which they are sold, which are altogether bad, one person after another using the same glass, which is only rinsed in water that after a while becomes dirty and contains saliva from the mouths of people who have used the glasses, which have been wiped in a none too cleanly cloth. One has only to watch the sale of ice creams outside the gates of a park on a summer's day to discover for themselves the truth on this matter. Legislation has done some good, but more is required, to compel the vendors to provide a separate vessel for the sale of each portion of ice cream. Such a vessel need not be glass, as at present; it could be made from paper, such as is constantly used for a similar purpose at public dinners, picnics and other entertainments. There is no reason why the people's popular ice cream should not be sold to them free from danger. Food sold by Hawkers, etc.—There is no doubt that the food sold by these people is generally of fairly good quality, although as a rule cheaper than that sold in shops. Much of it, too, is brought quite fresh from the market to the customer's door, or to the street stall, but that portion remaining over unsold from the preceding day comes from no one knows where. It is true that some of the food is taken to sheds, or other place of storage, but some of it also is frequently carried into the homes of the vendors. Particularly is this the case with the smaller traders, who sell apples, oranges, and the like fruits, or oysters, winkles and mussels. Not long since this matter was brought forcibly under the notice of the Medical Officer of Health through a Sanitary Inspector discovering a basket of oysters in a W.C. apartment which was uncleanly, and consequently gave off a strong effluvium ; while in another instance a quantity of winkles were discovered in a decomposing state in the room of a hawker (a woman), who lay drunk on the bed. These are not exceptional cases for the Medical Officer of Health has during his official life, now a quarter of a century long, frequently discovered foods, sold by hawkers, in their rooms, and even under their beds. People who sell foodstuffs should be compelled by law to possess proper storage places for the portions which remain unsold at the end of their day's work. 269 [1906 ADULTERATION OF FOOD AND DRUGS. Not the least important of the duties undertaken by the Public Health Department is that of protecting the public against the sophistication and adulteration of foods and drugs. Formerly these adulterations were more or less of a crude character, such as the addition of chalk to milk to hide its poor quality, or the mixture of sand with sugar to increase its weight. These crude methods have ceased, and science has been called more and more to the aid of those who would evade the provisions of the Adulteration Acts. Consequently the work of Public Analysts becomes more difficult and more laborious, for the duty devolves on them continuously to devise new tests and means to defeat the new trickeries. Notwithstanding these facts it is satisfactory to note that prosecutions under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts in Islington rarely break down, and never because of the unreliability or the uncertainty of the methods used by your Analyst, who during the last few years has had some severe battles to fight in the Courts in cases of considerable public interest. Samples Analysed.—1,190 samples of various foods and drugs were submitted to the Public Analyst (Dr. F. L. Teed), for examination, with the result that 111 (inclusive of 10 margarines), or 10.3 per cent., were adulterated or did not comply with the law. This proportion is slightly in excess of that of the two preceding years in which it was respectively 8.2 and 8.5 per cent. It is not always possible to judge by percentages whether the increase is real or only apparent, so much depends on the numbers of the different samples analysed, on the diligence of the Inspector, and on the persons from whom the samples are purchased. It must be remembered that many of the samples are taken from persons who are suspected of unfair dealing, and that comparatively few are purchased from firms or persons of acknowledged good repute, and whose goods in past years have always proved to be genuine. Of course if the contrary had been the case the figure of adulteration might sink almost to zero. Dairy Produce. 942 samples of dairy produce, among which is included Margarine, were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination, and of these 96, or 1o.2 per cent., were adulterated, as contrasted with 7.2 per cent. in 1905, 7.9 in 1904, and 9.7 per cent. in 1903. 1906] 270 The nature and particulars of the samples were as follows:— Milk Samples. Adulterated. Percentage Adulterated. Percentage Adulterated in 1905. Percentage Adulterated in 1904. 634 74 11.7 7.6 7.8 Milk (Separated) 3 1 33.3 ... ...

Samples examined. Adulterated. per cent. adulterated. 1st Quarter 172 16 9.3 2nd „ 153 19 12.4 3rd „ 153 18 11.8 4th 156 21 13.5 The Year 634 74 11.7 These samples were obtained. On Sundays 195, of which 22, or 11.3, were adulterated. On Weekdays 332, of which 51, or 15.4, were adulterated. At Railway Stations 110, of which 2, or r8, were adulterated. 271 [1906 The amount of adulteration detected rose among Sunday milks from 6.2 per cent. in 1905 to 11.3; among weekday milks from 9.0 per cent., to 15.4; while among railway milks it fell from 3.3 per cent. to 1.8. The increase of adulteration compared with the preceding year has been due to vendors adulterating their milks to a more limited, although a more frequent, extent than formerly, and among the returns from the Public Analyst, it will be noticed that 18 milks contained added water to the extent of 6 per cent. and under. Thus 3 samples contained less than 3 per cent. of water, 15 contained between 3 and 5 per cent., and 7 contained between 5 and 6 per cent. This practice is increasing and it is doubtless due to the fact that magistrates will not, except in very special cases, grant summonses for less than 6 per cent. Vendors know this, and, therefore, some of them push their adulteration to the limit of safety. It is a practice that should be put down rigorously, because it must not be forgotten that this percentage is based on a low standard of quality, and, therefore, these small percentages really represent larger amounts of adulteration than the Analyst's figures indicate. It is very certain that the milk purveyors would not accept from the farmers milk of the quality of these 25 milks which contained under 6 per cent. of water, and it is equally certain, if such a supply arrived at a railway station in Islington, that they would quickly apply to the Medical Officer of Health to have samples of it analysed. The quantity of water added to milk is calculated from the amount of non-fatty solids which it contains, and, therefore, a comparison of the analyses of the milks procured on Sundays and weekdays with those obtained at the railway stations as they arrive from the farmers is of interest, and proves that the milk is not sold in the same state as it is received. 1906] 272 Statement.

Fat. Total solids. 1,645 Sunday Milks - 8.53 - 3.64 - 12.17 2,444 Week-day Milks - 8.54 - 3.62 - 12.16 1,054 Farmers' Milk - 8.73 - 3.91 - 12.64 It will be noticed that the analyses of the Sunday milks and the weekday milks are almost identical and that the farmers' milks show a higher percentage of non-fatty solids as well as of fat. A calculation based on these figures indicates that the milks, Sunday and weekday alike, compared with the farmers' milks, have been adulterated with 2.2 per cent., of added water, in other words that in every 100 churns 21/5 are water; and that 7.2 per cent. of the fat or cream has been abstracted. Now a churn of milk contains 16 gallons (together with one quart as allowance for wastage) which is sold for not less than one shilling a gallon (three half-pence per pint), and as about 750* churns arrive daily, or 273,750 annually, by rail alone in Islington, the *The M.O.H. has since ascertained that fully 1,000 churns arrive on each weekday and 1,200 on Sundays. 278 [1906 profit on this would be the selling price of 6,022 churns, or 96,352 gallons, which, at one shilling a gallon, represents £4,817 12s., which is no inconsiderable sum of money. With respect to the fat or cream, it may be said that the usual method adopted is to add separated milk which contains only 0.5 per cent. of fat to milk, whereby its bulk is increased and therefore its proportion of fat reduced. By this means it is possible the Medical Officer of Health in a previous report (1902) showed,fopraduce although containing as nearly as possible 25 per cent. of separated milk. which would pass the official standard of 3 per cent. of fat. Of course, it is not for a moment to be thought that every milk vendor manipulates the milk with the view of reducing its strength, or producing an article which will merely pass the official standard, for there are milk purveyors in this borough, as well as throughout London, whose reputation is without reproach and who provide their customers with a really first class food, which for quality cannot be bettered anywhere. Their names will at once occur to any persons at all conversant with the milk question, and, therefore, need not be mentioned, particularly as it would be entirely out of place in an official report. A good deal of the blame is sometimes put on the farmers by London purveyors for the quality of the milk, and no doubt to a very small extent this may be justified, for it is true that some of them do not take sufficient care to ensure that each member of their herd produces milk of good quality. It is a well known fact that both in quantity and quality different cows give different results. For instance, recently Mr. Alexander Lauder, in reporting on some experiments that he made for the East Scotland Agricultural College, found that the yield of the best cow in a year was 1,505 gallons, and of the worst 478, and taking the value of the milk at 6¼d. per gallon, the five best cows produced milk worth £149 5s. od., or £29 17s. od. each, while the five which stood lowest on the list produced only £87 8s. od., or £17 1s. od. each. It may be safely stated that variations of this kind are not uncommon, and are not noticed from day to day, although at the end of the year, as the above figures will show, they amount to a considerable sum. He points out that a difference of 100 gallons in the year at 6¼d. is worth 52s. and that it is not too much to say that cows in the same herd frequently differ in their production by as much as £5 without the farmer being aware of it. In the Journal of the Board of Agriculture it has recently been indicated that where milk is used for butter making it is essential that the dairyman should see that all his cows are yielding milk with a high percentage of butter fat, otherwise, unless a very high price is obtained for the butter, the value obtained for the milk is very low. Every 25 lbs. of milk containing 3.6 per t 1906] 274 cent. of fat will produce one pound of butter, so that if the butter only fetches one shilling per pound, it represents less than fivepence per gallon for the milk, and it is therefore of the highest importance to every butter maker to see that the cows in the herd are producing milk of high quality. The Journal of the Board of Agriculture might, however, have gone further and pointed out that it was of even greater importance that the farmer should see that the milk which he is producing for human consumption shows a proportion of fat as high as that which is destined for butter. As a rule, in the one case (if the farmer thinks about it at all) he aims at getting a milk containing 3.25 per cent. of fat, while in the other he endeavours to get the largest amount possible, so that the making of butter may give him a return. There is not much excuse now for farmers continuing to retain cows in their herds which produce a low ratio of fat through ignorance of the quality of their milk, because the Board of Agriculture have made arrangements with most of the Agricultural Colleges as well as with the Agricultural Departments of the Universities for determining the percentage of butter fat for a fee of sixpence per sample. It remains to be seen how far use will be made of this privilege by farmers with the object of improving the quality of the milk that is intended for human food.

Preservatives in Milk.—In a circular, dated the nth July, 1906, the Local Government Board urged that action under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act with regard to preservatives in milk is desirable, and that this subject deserves attention from all authorities in England and Wales charged with the execution of these Acts. In this connection the following suggestions are made for adoption by the Council where a similar procedure is not already followed:— 1. Information from Public Analysts. The Board suggest that public analysts should be requested:— (a) To record in their quarterly reports how many milk samples have been examined during the quarter with a view to ascertaining the presence of substances commonly in use as preservatives, and with what results; and to draw the attention of the Council to instances where the use of preservatives in milk other than boron preservatives and formalin have come under notice. (b) To report on completion of analysis, the facts as to the samples of milk which have been found to contain any added preservative. 2. Administrative action where preservatives in milk are reported. The Board would suggest that the Council should notify to milk traders, by circular or otherwise, that action will be taken under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts in instances where preservatives are reported in milk. Subject to this being done, and to exceptional cases of the kind referred to under the heading numbered 3 below, the Board consider that when the presence of any added preservative is reported in a sample of milk taken in accordance with the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, the case should in ordinary circumstances be regarded as one for the institution of proceedings under those Acts. T 2 1906] 276 In view of these matters it may be well to reproduce the recommendations which the Departmental Committee made. They are as follows:— (a) That the use of any preservative or colouring matter whatever in milk offered for sale in the United Kingdom be constituted an offence under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. (b) That the only preservative which it shall be lawful to use in cream be boric acid or mixture of boric acid and borax, and in amount not exceeding 0.25 per cent., expressed as boric acid. The amount of such preservative to be notified by a label upon the vessel. (c) That the only preservative permitted to be used in butter and margarine be boric acid or mixtures of boric acid and borax, to be used in proportions not exceeding 0.5 per cent., expressed as boric acid. In consequence of this communication the Public Health Committee decided to ascertain the views of the Council's Public Analyst, as well as those of the Medical Officer of Health on the subject, and accordingly, having considered the matter, these officers reported there on. (Copy.) 9, Mincing Lane, London, E.C. July 18 th, 1906. W. F. Dewey, Esq., Town Clerk, Islington. LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD CIRCULAR OF JULY 11th, 1906. Dear Sir, I have now had an opportunity of carefully considering the above circular, and beg to lay my views before your Council. The circular alludes to the Report of the Departmental Committee on Preservatives and Colouring Matters in Food, one of whose recommendations was that no preservatives should be added to milk. The Local Government Board then further on recommends that proceedings should be taken where preservatives are reported in milk. The only proceedings which can be instituted under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts are proceedings authorised by those Acts, and it is not competent for either a Departmental Committee nor yet for the Local Government Board to change the law of England by in the one case a "recommendation" or in the other case a "circular." To refer in the first instance to the Departmental Committee. This Committee was appointed under the following terms of reference:— 277 1906 (1) Whether the use of such materials (i.e., preservatives and colouring matters) or of any of them, for the preservation and colouring of food, in certain quantities is injurious to health, and if so, in what proportions does their use become injurious. (2) To what extent, and in what amounts are they so used at the present time. The Committee made no answer to the first question. They were not asked to make recommendations which, however, they did make, and, strictly speaking, all these recommendations are ultra vires as not being within the terms of reference. Even had these recommendations been strictly within the terms of reference, they cannot alter the law. What has to be considered in taking proceedings is the question as to what proceedings are authorised by the Acts. In the event of proceedings being taken on account of the presence of preservatives in milk, they would have to be taken under Section 6 of the 1875 Act, for the sale of an article to the prejudice of the purchaser which is not of the nature, substance, and quality of the article demanded. But this Section goes on to say: "Provided that an offence shall not be deemed to be committed under this Section in the following cases; that is to say, (1) Where any matter or ingredient not injurious to health has been added to the food or drug because the same is required for the production or preparation thereof as an article of commerce, in a state fit for carriage or consumption, and not fraudulently to increase the bulk, weight, or measure of the food or drug, or conceal the inferior quality thereof." It has been held that this proviso means that the introduction of the injurious ingredient must be in such amount as to render the article injurious to health in order to constitute an offence. To my mind this proviso allows the addition of preservatives and colouring matters in any proportion provided that the article is not thereby rendered injurious to health. This view is confirmed by reference to the Schedule of the 1875 Act, footnote (d), "Here "the analyst may insert at his discretion his opinion as to whether the mixture (if any) was "for the purpose of rendering the article portable or palatable, or of preserving it, or of "improving the appearance, or was unavoidable, and may state whether in excess of what "is ordinary, or otherwise, and whether the ingredients or materials mixed are or are not "injurious to health." This footnote is just a paraphrase of the proviso just quoted, and includes the word "preserving," which I am of opinion comes under the heading of "preparation thereof as an article of commerce in a state fit for carriage or consumption." That the Acts contemplated and approved the employment of preservatives is again shown in the Margarine Act, 1887, Section 3: "The word ' butter ' shall mean the substance "usually known as butter .... with or without salt or other preservative, and with or without the addition of colouring matter." To clinch the matter I would refer you to Section 1 of the 1899 Act, last paragraph : "Provided that an article of food shall not be deemed to be adulterated by reason only "of the addition of any preservative or colouring matter of such nature and in such quantity "as not to render the article injurious to health." 1906] 278 As the whole section is headed "Precautions against importation of agricultural and other produce insufficiently marked," it might be contended that it was only to agricultural produce from abroad that the above proviso applied. There is, however, nothing in the wording to show that this is so, and, moreover, it is difficult to imagine that the Legislature contemplated that the foreigner should be expressly allowed to add preservatives to milk and other articles, the presence of which after importation should be an offence under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. I would now like to draw your attention to Section 4 of the 1899 Act, which, in my humble opinion, gives absolute power to the Board of Agriculture to prohibit or limit the amount of any preservative or other addition to milk, cream, butter, or cheese:— "the Board of Agriculture may .... make regulations for determining what addition of extraneous matter .... shall for the purposes of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts raise a presumption until the contrary is proved, that the milk ..... is injurious to health, and an analyst shall have regard to such regulations in certifying the result of an analysis under those Acts." I am not aware that the Board of Agriculture has exercised these powers. There is no need for fresh legislation on the point; the Acts are clear that the addition of any ingredient (preservative, colouring, or other matter) which would render an article injurious to health is an offence and power is given to the Board of Agriculture to state what ingredients and in what quantity when added to milk would render it injurious. I am in the hands of the Public Health Committee in this matter as representing the Council, and if they wish to test the state of the law I will, if desired, certify as to preservatives when present in any samples of milk that come before me, but I venture to suggest whether it would not be better in the first place to point out to the Local Government Board the powers already possessed by the Board of Agriculture in this connection and to point out that if the Local Government Board can get the Board of Agriculture to take their view all uncertainty will be at an end. I make this suggestion to the Public Health Committee for their consideration, and not in any way as an attempt to dictate what action, if any, should be taken. I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully, FRANK L. TEED. To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, CIRCULAR OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD re PRESERVATIVES IN MILK. You will notice that the Local Government Board have issued a circular to authorities under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts relative to the use of preservatives in Milk. I do not think, however, that their recommendation in paragraph 2 can be adopted, because the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts differentiate between harmful and harmless additions to food. For instance, Section 3 of the Act of 1875 states that "No person shall mix 279 [1906 "any article of food with any ingredient or material so as to render the article injurious to health." Therefore, it seems to me that a difficulty would arise at once if a prosecution were taken against a person using the minimum quantity of boric acid in milk because of the impossibility of proving that when so used it was a danger to health. Another difficulty might also arise by the antagonism of the Board's suggestion with Section 1 (7) of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, which deals with the prosecutions to be taken against the importation of agricultural and other produce from abroad, and which provides that "for the purpose of this section an article of food shall be deemed to "be adulterated or impoverished if it has been mixed with any other substance. "Provided that an article of food shall not be deemed to be adulterated by reason only of "the addition of any preservative or colouring matter of such a nature and in such quantities as not to render the article injurious to health." It is clear that under this section imported milk containing preservatives could be sold to the public, and if this be so, then it would be manifestly unfair to prosecute the vendors of English milk which contained "preservative matter of such a nature and in such quantity "as not to render the article injurious to health." Under these circumstances I am of opinion that it would be difficult to carry out the suggestion of the Board with respect to prosecutions. I am, Yours obediently, A. E. HARRIS, Medical Officer of Health. Town Hall, Upper Street, Islington, N. 23rd July, 1906. After carefully discussing these reports, the Public Health Committee directed the Town Clerk to send the following reply:— Town Hall, Upper Street, Islington, n. July 24th, 1906. Sir, My Council have had under consideration the circular recently issued by the Local Government Board with reference to the addition of preservatives to milk and in connection therewith reports thereon by their Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst. I am now directed to forward to the Board copies of the reports in question and to point out that Section 4 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, empowers the Board of Agriculture to prohibit or limit the amount of any preservative or other addition to milk, cream, butter or cheese; and to suggest that the Local Government Board should approach the Board of Agriculture with a view to the powers already possessed by them being exercised so that the uncertainty which exists in regard to the use of preservatives in milk may be removed. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, Wm. F. DEWEY, The Secretary, Town Clerk. Local Government Board. 1906] 280 The following letter was also received from the Assistant Secretary to the Local Government Board:— Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. August 17th, 1906. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to advert to your letter of the 27th ultimo, and its enclosures, with reference to the question of the addition of preservatives to milk. In reply, I am to state for the information of the Borough Council of Islington, that consideration such as those advanced in the reports of the Council's Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst had already been taken into account by the Board in preparing their Circular on the 11th ultimo, on " Preservatives in Milk." The Board observe that the Quarterly Reports during the past four years of the Public Analyst for Islington do not give any indication of the presence, absence, nature or amount of added preservatives, in any sample of milk submitted for analysis during that period; and the Board suggest that it would be of advantage, in the interest of the health of the Borough, that steps should now be taken as advised in their circular, to ascertain the condition of milk sold in Islington in regard to preservatives, and that administrative action on the line suggested in the Circular should be taken in cases where preservatives are reported. If in actual practice difficulty is found to arise in following the lines of action indicated by the Board, they will be glad to hear further from the Borough Council in the matter. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JOHN LITHIBY, Assistant Secretary. This letter was also submitted to the Public Analyst and the Medical Officer of Health, who made the following observations thereon:— Chemical Laboratory, 9, Mincing Lane, E.C. November 17th, 1906. W. F. Dewey, Esq., Town Clerk, Islington. Dear Mr. Dewey, PRESERVATIVES IN MILK. (Letter of Local Government Board of 17th August, 1906.) I have carefully perused the letter from the Local Government Board forwarded to me for comment, dated 17th August, 1906, and headed "89608. W. 1906." In writing my comments on the Local Government Board Circular of July 11th, my object was to bring to the notice of the Borough Council what I considered to be the law by which I was bound as a Public Analyst, and I quoted, among other extracts from the 281 [1906 Acts the proviso in Section 1 of the 1899 Act:—"Provided that an article of food shall "not be deemed to be adulterated by reason only of the addition of any preservative or "colouring matter of such a nature and in such quantities as not to render the article in jurious to health." The Local Government Board does not discuss the legal aspect of the case, but again urges that administrative action should be taken in cases where preservatives are reported in milk. I am personally of opinion that the Acts are not infringed when preservatives are used in such an amount as not to render the article injurious to health, but at the same time I recognise the fact that if prosecutions were instituted in such cases, convictions might be obtained in a certain number of cases, where the defendant was ignorant of the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. If the mere presence of the preservative in milk, even in amount not sufficient to render the milk injurious to health, is an offence, then it follows that the presence of any preservative in any article of food, except butter, would be an offence, for the Acts do not differentiate, in this connection between milk and other articles. Butter is excepted by the definition in the Margarine Act, which allows the presence of preservatives. There has been no new legislation since the report of the Committee on Preservatives and Colouring Matters appeared, and if the presence of a preservative in milk is an offence against the Acts, it must have been an offence before the report of that Committee appeared, therefore the sittings and recommendations of that Committee were superfluous. In fact, since the Sale of Pood and Drugs Act, 1875, became law, the presence of a trace of preservative or colouring matter in any article of food (except butter since 1887) must have been an infringement of that Act. I have endeavoured to give my views on this question of preservatives, and whatever is said about preservatives, applies equally well to colouring matters, although the Local Government Board do not refer to them, merely as a Public Analyst who, in order to thoroughly understand his business, has acquired a legal qualification, but I wish most distinctly to guard myself from appearing to aspire to the position of legal advisor to the Council on this or any other matter. The question is absolutely one of law, and although from a careful study of the subject I have been forced into certain conclusions, which I have laid before you, the proper responsible officer to advise the Council is your Solicitor. The letter of the Local Government Board raises a side issue by complaining that there has been no mention of the presence or absence of preservatives in the Quarterly Reports of the Public Analyst. The reason is obvious The Local Government Board prescribe a form of quarterly report to which the Analyst must adhere, and there is no suggestion in this form that preservatives should be reported on. As soon as the Local Government Board prescribe a form of report with a column for preservatives, the column will be filled up. Every sample of milk has been examined and reported on for boron preservatives during much longer than four years, although not reported in the Quarterly Reports. I return herewith, as requested, the letter from the Local Government Board. Yours faithfully, FRANK L. TEED. 1906] 282 To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, PRESERVATIVES IN MILK. (Letter from the Local Government Board, 17th August, 1906.) So far as the purely medical aspect of this question is concerned, I think that there is no uncertain opinion among my profession as to the undesirability of adding preservatives to milk, particularly when it is recollected that their addition has been dictated with a view (a) to cover the ill-effects of its collection amidst insanitary surroundings and under even dirty and filthy conditions, and (b) to mixing old and separated milk, which is generally a day older than the new milk, with new milk for the purpose of fraud. Unfortunately the Local Government Board has given no guidance in this matter, although a Departmental Committee in 1901 recommended the importance of more direct obligation on the Local Government Board to exercise supervision over the use of preservatives and colouring matters in foods, and to prepare schedules of such as may be considered inimical to the public health. In their circular of the 11th July, 1906, the Board made a slight departure, and make a pronouncement with respect to the amount of formalin and boric acid in milk, which is to cause a presumption that it has been rendered injurious to health. It is as follows:— As regards formalin and boron preservatives, however, the Board are advised that the presence in milk of formalin to an amount which is ascertained by examination within three days of collecting the sample to exceed 1 part in 40,000 (1 part in 100,000 of formic aldehyde) raises a strong presumption that the article has been rendered injurious to health, and that the purchaser has been prejudiced, in the above sense; and also that similar presumption is raised where boron preservatives are present in milk to an amount exceeding 57 parts of boric acid per 100,000, or 40 grs. per gallon. Henceforth very probably the amount of these preservatives will be looked upon as permissible in milk, as in face of the pronouncement no Magistrate will convict an offender if it is brought under his notice. On the other hand, it will be a guide to health authorities as to the amount of preservatives, beyond which they may be considered as injurious to health, and so induce them to take proceedings, which otherwise they would have refrained from. Personally, I have no hesitation in saying that I could support by my evidence that these preservatives in the quantities stated are detrimental to health, and I can consequently advise the Committee to proceed against persons who have added formalin or boric acid in excess of the Local Government Board's figures. I am, Your obedient Servant, A. E. HARRIS, Medical Officer of Health. Town Hall, Upper Street, N. November 26th, 1906. 283 [1906 The following circular letter was sent to every purveyor of milk in Islington:— Town Hall, Sir, Upper Street, N. PRESERVATIVES IN MILK. I am directed to inform you that the Local Government Board have requested the attention of my Council to the subject of the addition of preservatives to milk, and have suggested, in view of the finding of the Departmental Committee on Preservatives and Colouring Matters that their use is not only unnecessary for its preservation but injurious to persons consuming it, that the Council should notify to milk dealers that action will be taken under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts in all cases where preservatives are found. Under these circumstances I have to inform you that in future all milk purchased or procured for analysis by the Public Analyst will be examined for preservatives, and that should they be discovered, proceedings will follow. I am, Your obedient Servant, Wm. F. DEWEY, Town Clerk. Groceries.—151 samples, or 12.7 per cent. of all articles examined by the Public Analyst, were analysed, of which only 3, or 2.0 per cent., were adulterated, as compared with 6.7 per cent. in 1905 and 9.1 per cent. in 1904. The particulars of the articles examined were as follows:— No. of Samples. No. Adulterated. Percentage Adulterated. Percentage Adulterated in 1905.

Two test cases were taken, one against Mr. Thomas Samuel Wells and the other against Mr. James Davidge, the former being charged with selling Irish Whiskey and the latter Scotch Whiskey which was not of the nature, substance and quality demanded. In the result, Mr. Fordham, whose judgment was published in the report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1905, convicted the defendents and ordered each to pay 20s. and £100 costs. This judgment was afterwards appealed against, and the appeal was heard at the Clerkenwell Sessions in May and June, 1906, but unfortunately ended in an equal division of the Bench, and consequently there was no judgment. It is not proposed to discuss this matter, as the cases are still pending, but it may be remarked that the whiskey sold by Wells was nearly all patent spirit, and as the Magistrate points out "the men who actually handled the "spirit sold by the defendants before it was sold to them say that Wells' and "Davidge's samples were both 90 per cent. patent still spirit," and, he also adds, "that at least 90 per cent. of Wells' spirit was only one month old when "they put it into his cellar in May and so less than six months old when sold "by him in September; while what Davidge sold in June, 1905, as being Fine Old Scotch Whiskey' was, as to about 90 per cent., made in June, "1904, just one year before." Before concluding the judgment the Magistrate also declared, "it is time ''the fraud upon the public in the matter of the sale of whiskey was stopped, and, 285 [1906 "though doubtless these prosecutions are very costly to those who engage in them, the "information obtained and published in the course of the hearing of these two "summonses is most valuable, and the result of this trial seems to me to afford ample "justification for the prosecutions." The following differences, apart from those of an analytical character, between pot still whiskey and patent still spirit are interesting. Pot Still Whiskey. Patent Still Spirit. 1. Costs as it comes from still, at lowest 2s. 6d. per gallon. 1. Costs 10d. to 1s. per gallon. 2. It is kept 3 years before using, and each year adds at least 6d. per gallon to its cost. 2. It is generally used at once, and consequently it is sold at a third to one-sixth of the price of pot still. 3. It greatly improves on keeping. 3. There is little or no improvement, hence there is no object in keeping it. 4. It contains pure alcohol plus certain carminatives, which are chemically ascertainable, plus an essence which gives to it the characteristic taste and odour of whiskey, but which analysts have yet been unable to isolate. 4. It contains pure alcohol and very few carminatives and none of the essence. 5. It is made entirely from malt as in Scotch Whiskey, or from mixture of malt, oats, rye or wheat, as in Irish Whiskey. 5. It is generally made in this country from Indian corn (maize), but it is sometimes distilled from potatoes, beet, or even from saw dust. 6. All the grains from which it is made grow in the United Kingdom, and are grown specially for this purpose by farmers in Scotland and Ireland. 6. The Indian corn only grows in tropical or sub-tropical climes. 7. It is only manufactured in Scotland or Ireland. 7. It is made chiefly in Scotland but is also distilled in England, even in London, and even the latter is sold largely to the public as genuine Scotch and Irish Whiskeys. 1906] 286 8. It is manufactured from special water, and hence it has been manufactured only in Scotland and Ireland because it was found that in those countries only was the water suitable. It is never manufactured abroad, and hence Scotch and Irish Whiskeys are in great demand throughout the world. 8. It is manufactured from any water, and hence it can be made anywhere — Germany, France, England, America. It is exported and sold as Scotch or Irish Whiskey to the detriment of the legitimate trade. 9. It is distilled at least twice (as in Scotland) or 3 times (as in Ireland). 9. It undergoes only one distillation. 10. The Pot still is a still which is heated directly by fire in a large pot with a swan neck through which the spirit passes over. It requires more attention and more labour to manipulate it, and its work is intermittent. 10. The Patent Still is a complicated apparatus in which steam is brought into contact with the mash in a series of trays and it produces an almost pure alcohol, for which purpose it was invented, and in which pure alcohol is manufactured for commercial purposes. Its work is continuous. Drugs. 66 samples of various drugs were examined, of which 4, or 6.0 per cent. were returned as adulterated. Samples. Number adulterated. Percentage adulterated.

Block I may, it desired, be used for the whole district; and blocks 2, 3, &c., for the several localities. In small districts without recognised divisions of known population this Table need not be filled up. (b) Deaths of residents occurring in public institutions beyond the district are to be included in sub-columns ??? of this Table, and those of non-residents registered in public institutions in the district excluded. (See note on Table I. as to meaning of terms "resident" and "non-resident.") (c) Deaths of residents occurring in public institutions whether within or without the district are to be allotted to the respective localities, according to the addresses of the deceased (d) Care should be taken that the gross totals of the several columns in this Table respectively equal the corresponding totals for the whole districts in Tables I and IV.: thus the totals of sub-columns a, b and c should agree with the figures for the year in the columns 2, 3, and 12 respectively of Table I the gross total of the sub-columns ??? should agree with the total of column 2 in Table IV., and the gross total of sub-columns d with the total of column 3 in Table IV 307 [1906 LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD RETURN—Table IV.
