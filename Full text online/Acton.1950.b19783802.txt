ACT53 439(1)ACTON BOROUGH OF ACTON ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TOGETHER WITH THE REPORT ON THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS FOR THE YEAR 1950 BOROUGH OF ACTON ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TOGETHER WITH THE REPORT ON THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS FOR THE YEAR 1950 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1950 Public Health Department, Town Hall, Acton, W.3 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Acton. Ladies and Gentlemen, I submit the annual report of the Health of the Borough of Acton for 1950. I have included such figures relevant to work which is of interest to you although transferred to the County Council. The statistics of the Borough show that of 1,000 children born, 25.1died before attaining the age of 1 year. For England and wales the figure is '29.8. One feels that this figure will not fall lower than this for some time. Of the 25 children who died under 1 year of age, 17 were diagnosed as being premature and did not survive for a week. By " prematurity " is meant the physical condition of a child born before full term, whereby the child has some weakness which lessens its chance of survival. The birth rate is 14.6 and the death rate 11.3 per 1,000 of the Population ; in 1949 these figures were 15.4 and 10.8 respectively. I should like to thank the staff of the Public Health Department for their kind co-operation and loyalty throughout the year. I remain, Your Obedient Servant, George E, B. Payne. 4 STAFF George E. B.

The Ministry of Health Emergency Medical Service provides a Pathological Service at the King Edward Memorial Hospital Laboratory at Ealing. The following Table gives the types, and number, of specimens Submitted for examination. Type No. of specimens examined Throat and Nose Swabs 463 Sputum for T.B. 3 Fæces 122 Hair and Widals 1 Methylene Blue Reductase Tests on Milk and Ice-Cream 397 Ambulance Facilities The Middlesex County Council are responsible for this service. Cursing in the Home This service is administered locally by the Middlesex County Council. The number of sick persons under care in Acton during the year was 870, necessitating 22,499 visits. Hospital Provisions The Regional Hospital Board of the N.W. Metropolitan Area, which includes Acton is responsible for hospital treatment of the sick. The most difficult cases for which to obtain treatment are old Persons or chronic sick who become acutely ill or who are in the terminal stage of their illness. These types of cases need continuous care and treatment, and this cannot be given in the home. 12 National Assistance Act, 1948 No cases have been dealt with under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, but in those cases which have come to our notice it has been possible, by co-operating with the local hospital to arrange for these persons to be admitted. The Borough of Acton carried out its obligations under Section 50 of this Act. Maternity and Child Welfare There continued to be five Centres accommodating six Health Visitors' districts. (1) The School Clinic, Avenue Road (two Health Visitors' districts served by this Centre). (2) Steele Road Mission Hall, Acton Green. (3) John Perryn School, East Acton. (4) St. Gabriel's Church Hall, Noel Road, North West Acton. (5) Palmerston Road Hall, South Acton. As in the previous year, two weekly sessions were held for each Health Visitor's district, one with a doctor in attendance, and one without. Average weekly attendances (last year's figures in brackets): — Central district 80. (98.5) South East 55. (70.2) South West 67. (81.5) North East 73. (78.4) North West 42. (52.) West 75. (90.) The numbers of mothers and children seen and treated at the Ophthalmic and Dental Clinics are given in the School Medical Report. 13 Health Visiting Number of visits paid during the year by all Health Visitors working in this area: To expectant mothers First visits 368 Total visits 513 To children under one year of age First visits 932 Total visits 3208 To children between the ages of one and five years Total visits 3786 Infant Welfare Centres Total number of children who first attended the Centres during the year, and who, on the date of their first attendance, were: Under one year of age 910 Between the ages of one and five 73 Total number of children in attendance at the end of the year and who, at the end of the year were: Under one year of age 680 Over one year 2207 Total number of attendances at Centres during the year: By children under one year of age 13249 By children between one and five years 6575 Midwifery Service Domiciliary Midwifery was performed as in previous years by the Midwives of Queen Charlotte's Hospital. During 1950, 314 women were recommended for admission to Central Middlesex County Hospital for their confinements and most of these were accepted, 14 Ante-Natal Clinics Three Ante-Natal Clinics were held weekly at Avenue Road, and a fourth session was held at Palmerston Road clinic. Number of new Cases attending Clinics during year 772 Total number of attendances made 3456 Average number attending weekly (4 clinics) 66 The arrangements made by women for their confinements are tabulated below: % Confined in Central Middlesex County Hospital 42.1 Confined in Queen Charlotte's Hospital 21.1 Confined in other Hospitals 7.0 Confined in Nursing Homes 4.3 Confined at home (Queen Charlotte's Midwives attending) 24.9 Private Doctors and Midwives 0.6 Post-Natal Clinics The majority of women had their post-natal examination at the hospital where they were confined, those confined at home being examined at Queen Charlotte's Hospital. 4 women attended our clinic for their examination. Exercises Class for Mothers The classes for expectant mothers were again a feature of the ante-natal work, the total number of women attending in 1950 being 99, as against 105 in 1949. The total number of attendances was 1411 as compared with 1195 for 1949. Birth Control Clinic As in previous years, arrangements for this purpose with the North Kensington Women's Welfare Association were continued. One clinic weekly was held at the Palmerston Road Hall, South Acton, a nominal fee being paid to the County Council for the use of the premises. 6 patients were referred for advice in 1950, 15 Home Help Scheme At the end of the year there were 8 Full-time Domestic and Home Helps, and 43 Part-time Staff. The following Table shows the number of cases booked and those actually attended: — Maternity: Total number of applications received 84 Number of Cases attended 66 T.B. Cases attended 31 Other Cases attended 311 Day Nurseries Towards the close of 1950 new rules were formulated for admission to Day Nurseries. The immediate effect of the application of these rules was to eliminate the waiting list. Very few of the persons circularised were willing to submit their alleged incomes to such a rigid scrutiny, and accordingly withdrew their applications. A Panel of members of the Area Health Committee was formed to consider new applications and to review those cases already in the nursery. This review was still in progress at the end of the year, and the same four nurseries were in being, namely Bollo Bridge Road, Horn Lane, " St. Dunstans," Friars Place Lane, and " Longcot," Newton Grove " Longcot," Newton Grove. The accommodation at these was as follows: Under 2 Over 2 Total Bollo Bridge Road 17 18 35 Horn Lane 25 35 60 Friars Place Lane 20 25 45 " Longcot" Newton Grove 19 25 44 The numbers on the register at 31st December, 1950, were as follows: — Bollo Bridge Road 39 Horn Lane 66 Friars Place Lane 42 " Longcot" 44 The average daily attendances were: — Under 2 Over 2 Total Bollo Bridge Road 14.01 15.7 29.71 Horn Lane 16.3 31.0 47.3 Friars Place Lane 10.0 29.2 39.2 " Longcot" 13.9 23.5 37.4 16 Diphtheria immunisation Immunisation was carried out along the lines indicated in previous reports, the following routine being practised: — (1) A notice was sent to the parent of each 9 months' old child. (2) All infant Welfare attenders were approached. (3) All children admitted to Day Nurseries were offered protection. (4) Health Visitors combed their districts for children who did not attend Welfares, and urged their protection. (5) Head Teachers gave forms of consent to new school entrants. (6) Prior to school medical inspections, questionnaires were sent to each parent asking, inter alia, whether the child had been inoculated. If the answer was in the negative a form of consent was sent to the parent. All immunised cases were followed up and, at the end of three years, each child was offered a boost dose. At the age of 11 years or over, this was preceded by a Schick test. All children under 5 who had not had the disease, were inoculated against Whooping Cough at the same time as they were inoculated against Diphtheria, i.e. they had three doses of protective material at monthly intervals. 60.6% of the population under 5 years of age is now protected, and 85.7% of the population aged 5 to 14.

All were of a mild character, many being nursed at home. Diphtheria One case of diphtheria was notified—a boy in the age group 5-9. He had previously been immunised as an infant but had not had a boost dose. It was a severe attack of the gravis type of bacteria, but after a long convalescence the boy recovered. 453 cases of measles were notified during the year. Of this; number almost all (444) occurred in the age groups 1-9 years. With this epidemic of measles there coincided a great increase in whooping cough, the major part occurring in the age group 1-9 years. One case of para-typhoid was reported in an adult aged 23i He was admitted to Hospital from the Railway Hostel, being a fireman on a train running between Paddington and Bristol. He was primarily diagnosed as a case of appendicitis, but after his appendix was removed he was re-diagnosed as a case of para-typhoid fever and transferred to the Isolation Hospital. On investigation one; could find no trace of the source of infection except that he had purchased ice-cream from a shop in an adjacent borough and had swum in the river Thames. The M.O.H. in the area in which this man swam assured me there had been no cases of para-typhold fever traced to swimming in that part of the Thames running through his Borough. The M.O.H. in whose area he had partaken of ice-cream also carried out a rigorous inspection and found that the ice-creams sold were in a satisfactory condition. Poliomyelitis 6 cases of Poliomyelitis were notified during the year. Only one of these was a severe case. Paralysis of the limbs occurred and unfortunately the child died. 19 TUBERCULOSIS Age Periods NEW CASES DEATHS Respiratory Non-Respiratory Respiratory Non-Respiratory Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female 0 – – 2 – – – 2 – – 1 – 2 1 1 – – – – – 5 – – 3 1 – – – – – 15 – 13 13 – 2 – – – – 25 – 18 8 – – – 1 – – 35 – 4 6 1 – 4 – – – 45 – 9 2 2 2 3 – – – 55 – 4 – – – 2 – – – 65 upwards 2 – – – 3 – – 1 52 35 5 4 12 3 – 1 20 Statement of particulars appearing on the Register of cases of Tuberculosis for the year ending 1950 Pulmonary NonPulmonary Total (a) Number of cases of T.B. on the Register at the commencement of the year 457 males 316 females 86 males 83 females 942 (b) Number of cases notified for the first time during the year 52 males 36 females 6 males 4 females 98 (c.)

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply The Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board. The whole of the population is supplied from the public water mains direct to each house and the supply has been satisfactory. In addition to the public supply, there are three deep wells in the district, two at factory premises, and one at the Public Baths. Samples of water from these wells have been taken from time to time and on submission to bacteriological and chemical examinations have proved satisfactory. Drainage and Sewerage. Ail the dwelling houses are provided with water closets and are connected to the sewerage system which discharges, by an arrangement with the L.C.C., into the London sewers. Stormwater is filtered and emptied into the Thames. Public Cleansing The amount of house refuse collected by the Council in 1950 was 17,894 tons and trade refuse collected amounted to 978 tons. A total weight of 3,914 tons was destroyed by destructor and 14,958 tons was removed to controlled shoots. In addition to the foregoing, 2,465 tons of Salvage were sold. Rodent Control Test treatment of public sewers and treatment as necessary have been continued in accordance with the recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture & Fisheries. The services of the Council's Rodent Destruction staff has been divided as occasion has demanded between disposal of newly discovered rats and mice by intensive treatment, and the regular visitation, examination and treatment of business premises. The great value of this maintenance treatment is that rodents which have gained ingress to premises during hours when buildings are closed down, are not allowed to settle in, and thus infestation in the full sense is prevented. 26 Investigation, destruction 'and maintenance have entailed a total of '2,711 visits by the Rodent Operatives, 1,972 to business premises, and 739 to dwellings, in addition to inspections by the Sanitary Inspectors as noted elsewhere. Inspection of Factories There are 672 premises within the borough in connection with which the Sanitary Inspectors make inspection from time to time to ascertain that the provisions of the Factories Act, 1937, and the Sanitary Accommodation Regulations are complied with. In addition to this routine work, hygiene of canteens etc., has received attention, and advice as to the fitness of food for human consumption, has been given as necessary. Investigations were conducted in relation to alleged cases of food poisoning in factory canteens, but there was no case where evidence was conclusive that food poisoning had in fact occurred in any factory canteen in the Borough. There was no adverse condition in any canteen which merited action by the department under the Public Health or Food & Drugs Acts. The home addresses of 94 outworkers engaged in work at home for Factories within and outside the Borough, have been visited to ascertain hygienic conditions and freedom from infectious disease. Sanitary Inspection of the Area The following table includes the tabular statement by the Chief Sanitaiy Inspector under article 27 (18) of the Sanitary Officers (Outside London) regulations, 1935.

Under the direction of the various Departments of the Ministry of food much inferior food material is received into the Borough for manufacturing purposes subject to control by the Local Authorand the Sanitary Inspectors carry out necessary examinations for ensure that only sound material is used; this accounts generally for the bulk surrenders. Two large wholesale grocery Depots are within the Borough, this hence surrenders of canned and packeted goods are made to * Authority; these surrenders constitute the maior part of such food stuff noted. The following list collated for convenience shows some details °f the surrendered food-stuffs:— !,resh meat, various 2 tons, 5 cwt. 36 lbs. inned meat, various 1,819 tins. Ham 59 lbs. Bacon 2 qtrs. 5 lbs. Sausages 77 lbs. babbits 114 lbs. takers Sundries 1 ton 4 cwt Confectionery 440 lbs. Strawberry pulp 3 casks. Preserves, various 1,782 tins. Fish 53½ stone. Fish 3,327 tins.

During the year there were 52 complaints as to unsound food or food not of the nature, quality or substance demanded, and ini three cases the Council instituted Court Proceedings, resulted as follows: — For the sale of a loaf containing a safety razor blade the bakers of the bread were fined ±12, and costs of four guineas were awarded to the Council. A firm of sausage manufacturers outside the Borough was discharged absolutely in respect of a foreign body; in a pork sausage, but ordered to pay the Council's costs in the prosecution. For selling a loaf of bread in which was a wood screw, a firm of bakers outside the Borough was discharged absolutely/ but ordered to pay the Council's costs in the prosecution. Milk There has been no change in the number of establishments in the Borough where milk is bottled preparatory to local distribution,! and the good standard of hygiene has been maintained. The wholesale pasteurising and bottling centre in Bollo Lane has also operated! with complete absence of cause for complaint. As to sampling, the results are worthy of special note, as of 113 samples taken and sub-) mitted to the Pathological Laboratory of the Ministry of Health,) 31 there were no failures in respect of Methylene Blue or Phosphatase tests. Empty bottles taken from the filling lines at the centre in Bollo Lane for examination as to sterility totalled 46 and on examination all were found to be sterile. Ice-cream The manufacturers of ice-cream in the Borough now total 11, while there are 88 premises where ice-cream is not manufactured but where the commodity is sold in the main from pre-packed stocks. During the year 281 samples were taken, 164 of ice-cream manufactured in the Borough, and 117 from shops or itinerant vendors who were trading in ice-cream manufactured outside the Borough. The grading of the samples referred to indicates the excellent standard of the commodity manufactured in Acton, and expressed in percentages reads as follows: — Grade I. 61.6% Grade II. 26.9% Grade III. 7.9% Grade IV. 3.6% The result of overall sampling indicated a generally satisfactory condition of premises, processing, storage, and trading. Water In the course of the year 59 samples of water were submitted to the Council's Analyst or the Pathologist for examination as to chemical or bacteriological content. The results invariably indicated a satisfactory source of supply. Clean Food Exhibition During the year the Council adopted new Bye-laws with respect to the handling, wrapping and delivery of food, and held a Clean Food Exhibition in the Town Hall. 32 The exhibition was an undoubted success in that the public showed a very deep interest, there being an attendance of upwards of 9,000 visitors. Many were older children from schools in and outside the Borough in specially conducted parties. Contributions to the Exhibition with its 36 stands were from a wide field of interested and public-spirited traders and associations, and were representative of practically the whole of the extensive food producing factories and stores in the Borough. In addition to the firms occupying stands in the Exhibition, a local dairy and bakehouse were opened to the public, who were able to see normal working conditions in model premises. The Ministry of Agriculture & Fisheries, Infestation Control Division, assisted greatly in the preparation of the Exhibition, and the excellent work of the Department in conserving food supplies by Infestation Control was portrayed in a special arrangement of stands and by films and posters. The nature of the work of the Public Health Department was displayed on special stands, and that on meat and food inspection proved a very popular attraction. The "dirty food shop" showing storage of food and business conducted on unhygienic lines was in sharp contrast to the displays of model food sales premises. Among the films displayed to the public was the special one "Another case of Food Poisoning" telling of the causes of the spread of infection through food handling without due care, and an excellent directive to hygiene practices in relation to food handling in preparation, cooking, sale and service. Disease of Animals Act The Borough was free from notifiable diseases of animals throughout the year, and was not involved in any out-break occurr-; ing elsewhere. Slaughterhouses The Slaughterhouses in Atlas Road and Hanbury Road have been in commission throughout the year, and the carcase and offal of every animal slaughtered have been examined as to their fitness for human food. There was a reduction in the number of horses slaughtered for human food—but the quality of the flesh was maintained. With regard to the incidence of T.B. in pork the percentage of animals affected was .08% lower than last year. 33 The Slaughter House at Hanbury Road was the subject of a special report by a Departmental Committee set up by the Government to investigate the conditions under which horses were being transported and slaughtered for human consumption. The Report expressed satisfaction with regard to the premises of Western Abattoir Ltd., and was particularly complimentary on the vehicles being used by Mr. F. Moore, a local horse dealer, for transporting horses by road. Total Number of carcases inspected with details of surrender on account of disease. Pigs Horses 1. No. killed 88,654 5,108 2.
