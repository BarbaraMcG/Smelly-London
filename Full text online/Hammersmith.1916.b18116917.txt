HAM 17 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health OF THE borough of hammersmith For the Year 1916. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH OF THE BOROUGH OF HAMMERSMITH For the Year 1916. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith. Gentlemen,—In the absence of Dr. Howell, who is serving in the Army, I beg to submit the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1916, which, in accordance with the suggestion of the Local Government Board, is limited to a record of the most important facts and figures. Population.—The following estimates of population have been adopted by the Registrar General for the calculation of the Death Rate and Birth Rate of the borough for the year 1916. For the Death Rate 117,965 For the Birth Rate 128.-348 The former is an estimate of the civilian population ; the latter of the total population, based on the assumption that the ratio between the total and the civilian population is the same in the borough as in England and Wales as a whole. Marriages.—1,192 marriages were registered during the year against 1,503 in 1915, and the marriage rate, i.e., the number of persons married per 1,000 inhabitants, was 18.7. Births.—Excluding one birth among non-residents, but including 194 children born of Hammersmith mothers in lying-in institutions situated in other boroughs, 2,605 births were registered, representing a birth rate of 20.3 per 1,000 of the estimated total population, which is the lowest rate recorded in Hammersmith, and 3.0 per 1,000 below the average rate of the preceding five years. 2 Illegitimacy.—The illegitimates numbered 78, or 3 per cent, of the total births. Deaths.—During 1916, 1,230 deaths of civilians were registered in the borough, but of these 174 were of persons not belonging to the borough, while 612 inhabitants of Hammersmith died outside the borough, chiefly in various public institutions. There were therefore 1,668 deaths of persons having their usual residence in Hammersmith, representing a Death Rate of 14.2 per 1,000 of the estimated civilian population, which is 0.4 per 1,000 below the average rate of the preceding five years. The Death Rate of the County of London was 14.7 per 1,000, and in the various Metropolitan boroughs the rates ranged from 10.7 in Hampstead to 19.4 in Finsbury. Excess of Births Over Deaths.—The natural increase of the population by the excess of births over deaths was 937, compared with 1,290, 937, and 787 in the preceding three years. The following table gives the statistics ot the borough during 1916 and the five previous years in the form prescribed by the Local Government Board. TABLE I.

The infantile mortality rate of the County of London was 89 per 1,000, and in the Metropolitan boroughs the rates ranged from 61 in Stoke Newington to 123 in Shoreditch and Finsbury. Deaths of Illegitimate Infants.—Of the 222 infants who died before attaining the age of oneyear,42,or 19 per cent, were illegitimate, Jthe mortality among them being in the proportion of 222 deaths per 1,000 illegitimate births against 74 per 1,000 among children born in wedlock.

Parents. 1,222 789 I32 15 150 The appointment of two additional Health Visitors, Miss Henry and Miss Wilcox, in May, 1916, enabled the home visitation of infants to be more actively undertaken, and 2,440 first visits, and 7,177 subsequent visits were paid by your Health Visitors against a total of 2,550 visits in 1915. The feeding of the infants was found to be as follows :— Breast fed 2,020 Hand and breast fed 207 Hand only 213 In addition to the visits paid by the Health Visitors, a large amount of infant welfare work is done in the borough by Voluntary Associations, who co-operate closely with the Public Health Department. To the consultations held at the various welfare centres 746 babies were brought, and their total attendance numbered 7,878, while 3,739 home visits were paid by the salaried and voluntary visitors of the Associations. Clinics for expectant mothers were held at the Welfare Centres of the Hammersmith School for Mothers, at Shaftesbury Road, and the Women's League of Service, 161, Sulgrave Road, at which 119 women attended, and at the latter Centre dinners are provided at a small charge for nursing and expectant mothers.

To other forms of tuberculous diseases 33 deaths were ascribed, nearly 13 per cent, of the deaths from all causes being due to some form of tuberculosis. It is much to be regretted that no scheme for the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis has been adopted by the Borough Council. The question of the establishment of a tuberculosis dispensary in the borough was referred by the Council to a Sub-Committee, who reported, that having regard to war conditions affecting particularly questions of staff and public economy, they considered it inadvisable to proceed either with the scheme which had been approved by the Council or with the temporary measure suggested by the Local Government Board. The report was adopted by the Council, who instructed the Town Clerk to inform the Local Government Board of the decision of the Council. 9 deaths from non-notifiable infectious diseases.
