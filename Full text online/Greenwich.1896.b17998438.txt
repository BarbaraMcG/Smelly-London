To the Greenwich District Board of Works. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the Annual Report on the Vital Statistics and Sanitary Work for (the 53 weeks ending January 2nd, 1897,) the Registration Year 1896. POPULATION. According to the Census taken March 29th, 1896, the population of Saint Paul's Parish was 107,273, and that for Saint Nicholas Parish was 7,722, or a total population of the combined parishes, 114,995; being an increase, since the last Census (1891), for Saint Paul's Parish, of 6,021, and for Saint Nicholas Parish, 894, or a total increase, for the two combined parishes, of 6,915. BIRTHS. The number of births registered during the year 1896 was 3,863 (1,999 males, and 1,864 females), being an increase over 19 previous years, and equivalent to an annual rate of 33.5 per 1,000 persons living. The Birth Rate for London, during the same period, was 30.2, and for the thirty-three great towns 30.7. There were 3,560 births registered in the Parish of Saint Paul (1,834 males, and 1,726 females), and 303 in Saint Nicholas(165 males, and 138 females). DEATHS. The number of deaths registered in Saint Paul's Parish was 1,580, in Saint Nicholas Parish 171, in the South-Eastern Metropolitan Asylum Board's Hospital 288, and in outlying public institutions 447, making a total of 2,486. Of the 288 deaths registered as occurring in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's South-Eastern Hospital, 258 were of persons not residing in Deptford but who had been taken to the Hospital from other parts of the Metropolis. If these deaths are deducted from the gross number occurring in my district, it makes the number of deaths of parishioners only—including those dying in outlying public institutions—2,228, equivalent to an annual Death Rate of 19.4 per 1,000 persons living. The Death Rate in the thirty-three great towns of England and Wales during the year averaged 18.9 per 1,000 persons living, whilst the Death Rate for the Metropolis was 18.6 per 1,000; that for Saint Paul's Parish, including all Parishioners whether dying in or out of the parish, 18.7, and for Saint Nicholas Parish 28.1. Full details will be found in Tabular Forms Nos. 1 and 2, and Table No. 2 gives the Statistics of the births and deaths in the two parishes during the year, showing the number of deaths 20 which occurred at the outlying public institutions and the Metropolitan Asylums Board's South-Eastern Hospital, including non-parishioners. Table No. 3 shows the Death Rate in the two parishes during the last 11 years. Table No. 4 shows the excess of births over deaths in the two Parishes of Saint Paul and Saint Nicholas, Deptford. MORTALITY AT GROUPS OF AGES. The 2,486 deaths last year included 1,226 children under five years of age. The deaths of 135 children occurred between the ages of 5 and 10 ; 212 of persons between 10 and 30 years; 665 were of persons aged between 30 and 70; and 249 were of persons aged upwards of 70. INFANTILE MORTALITY. The deaths of young children always bear a high ratio to the total deaths ; out of a total of 2,486 deaths registered during the year, there were no less than 646 infants under one year of age, being at the rate of 168 for every 1,000 births registered, whilst in the Metropolis as a whole it averaged 161, and in the thirty-three great provincial towns it was 167 to every 1,000 births. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The average Death Rate from the principal Zymotic diseases in the two Parishes, including the parishioners who died in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's South-Eastern Hospital was 3.4, as against 3.14 per 1,000 in London generally. The number of deaths from all Zymotic diseases registered as occurring at the houses of the parishioners was 379, as against 21 282 and 330 for the two previous years, whilst in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's South-Eastern Hospital 261 were registered; of these, 30 were parishioners of Deptford. A full detailed account of the deaths from all the Zymotic diseases which occurred in the two parishes, as well as in the Hospital, will be found in Tables Nos. 5 and 6, and a full account of the Infectious diseases which have been notified in Deptford (1,478 in all), under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, will be found in Table No. 7. Table No. 8 shows the cases notified and deaths from principal Infectious diseases in London, during the year ending January 2nd, 1896. Table No. 9 gives the analysis of the vital and mortal statistics of thirty-three of the largest English towns during the year 1896, showing, among other particulars, the statistics of the deaths from the principal Zymotic diseases. Small-Pox. Only nine cases occurred in the district during the year, though 12 certificates of notification were received under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891; 4 cases occurred in one family in Mill Lane, 2 in one house in Church Street, 2 in one house in Queen Street, and one case in Ravensbourne Street; all were removed to Hospital for treatment. Two other cases were returned from the Hospital as not Small-Pox, and one case was reported twice. For the previous year the number notified was 35. Scarlet Fever. Of this disease, no less than 759 cases were notified in my district, as against 608 and 789 for the two preceding years; 15 deaths were recorded in the district, and 73 22 in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's South-Eastern Hospital; of these, 8 were parishioners. In the previous year, 11 deaths were registered in the district, and 69 in the Hospital. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. Only 431 cases were notified during the year, as against 636 for the previous year; 44 deaths occurred in the two parishes, and 146 deaths were registered in the South-Eastern Metropolitan Asylum Board's Hospital; of these 20 were parishioners of Deptford. For the year 1895 there were 63 deaths in the district, and 126 deaths in the Hospital. Fevers. This term includes Typhoid or Enteric, Typhus, Simple or Continued, and ill-defined forms of Fever, to which 12 deaths were attributed in the district during the year; 30 deaths were registered in the Hospital. Of these only one was a parishioner of Deptford, and 86 cases were notified under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. For the year 1895, 119 cases were reported, whilst eight deaths were registered in the district, and 45 in the Hospital. Puerperal Fever. There were 18 cases of this disease notified, and 4 deaths were registered. In the previous year 13 cases were reported, and 3 deaths were recorded. There was a general increase throughout the Metropolis of Puerperal Fever during the year. Measles is not a notifiable disease under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, therefore it is impossible to ascertain the number of cases which occurred in the district, but the number of deaths registered in the two parishes was 120, and 11 in the Hospital, far in excess of the previous year, when only 25 deaths 23 were registered in the two parishes. This disease, according to the Registrar-General's report, appears to have been more fatal last year in London than in any previous year on record, with the single exception of the year 1864. The great mortality of this disease is due to pulmonary complications, and the want of proper isolation, personal cleanliness, and inadequate ventilation amongst the poorer classes, tend to increase the spread of the disease. The question of including Measles among the notifiable diseases has been fully discussed, but the general opinion is, so far as London is concerned, that it is a question of expense; it would necessitate a considerable increase in Hospital accommodation, and increase also in the Sanitary Staff. Whooping Cough was the cause of 78 deaths, as against 45 and 78 in the the two preceding years; this excess was general throughout London. Influenza. The deaths referred to Influenza in the course of 1896 amounted to 12, a number which is considerably smaller than in any year since 1890, the first year of the epidemic in London. For the year 1895 no less than 71 deaths were registered from this disease. Diarrhœa. During the year 90 deaths were registered, as against 67 and 50 for the two previous years. Respiratory Diseases. Under this heading are included Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and Pleurisy; 410 deaths were referred to these diseases, as against 453 for the year previous; 339 occurred in the district and 71 in outlying institutions. 24 Phthisis, or Pulmonary Consumption, was the cause of 126 deaths in the district, and 35 in outlying institutions, or a total of 161, as compared with 177 for the year 1895. GENERAL REMARKS. It will be seen by the Return* furnished by the Sanitary Inspectors, the amount and character of Sanitary work that has been carried out in my district during the past year; out of a total of 3871 premises inspected, in only 21 cases was it necessary to take legal proceedings. There were notices to abate over-crowding in 46 cases. The Disinfector had 898 rooms to disinfect; and here I should like to say that disinfections should at all times be carried out by the Sanitary Authority, otherwise it is imperfectly done, as all the clothing and bedding used by the patient should be subjected to a high temperature of moist heat, which cannot be done in private houses, least of all in the houses of the poor. The particulars of the rooms and articles disinfected are shown in Table No. 10. No use was made during the year of the temporary shelter or house accommodation, which has been provided according to the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, for members of any family who have been compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority. In consequence of the outbreak of Diphtheria in an adjoining district, I had a very careful inspection made of all Schools in my district, and where any insanitary conditions were found, notices were served to abate the same. *The Return above referred to follows Table No. II. 25 The sale and manufacture of Ice Cream occupied the attention of the public during the summer months, and I made a register and inspection of all premises in the district where Ice Cream was made and stored, and found all in a fairly satisfactory condition ; any suggestions I had to make were willingly carried out, and the Inspectors kept a constant supervision over them. Smoke Nuisances.—The different factories in the district have received constant attention, and notices were served to abate the nuisances in 12 cases. Of the offensive trades carried on in the district in only one case was it necessary to serve a notice to abate the nuisance, and that a Tripe Boiling Factory in the Foreign Cattle Market. Workshops, Factories, and Laundries, &c., have received constant supervision : overcrowding has been abated, and proper sanitary accommodation provided for the different sexes. 73 inspections were made. Bakehouses have received frequent and careful inspection. They are all well maintained, and in a cleanly condition both as regards the limewashing of the walls and the sweeping of the floors, &c. Cowsheds and slaughter-houses have been regularly inspected and all the cowsheds were found to be in good repair and wellkept. The slaughter-houses were also found in good condition. The Inspectors, acting under instructions, made frequent examinations of articles of food submitted for sale, and in consequence of these inspections, a quantity of articles were voluntarily destroyed by the persons exposing them for sale. Houses let in Lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family, with respect to which the following Bye-laws 26 under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, were passed in the month of October:— PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891.

Where the Medical Officer of Health, the Sanitary Inspector or any other Officer specially appointed or authorized by the Sanitary Authority in that behalf, has, for the purpose of inspection, obtained access to the interior of a lodging-house or to the interior of any room or rooms in such house, a person shall not wilfully obstruct any such officer in the inspection of any part of the premises, or, without reasonable excuse, neglect or refuse when required by any such officer, to render him such assistance as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of such inspection. 9. In any case where a lodger in a lodging-house is entitled to the exclusive use of any court, courtyard, area, or other open space within the curtilage of the premises, such lodger, and in any case where two or more lodgers in a lodging-house are entitled to the use in common of any court, courtyard, area, or other open space within the curtilage of the premises, the landlord shall cause such court, courtyard, area, or other open space to be thoroughly 30 cleansed from time to time as often as may be requisite for the purpose of keeping the same in a cleanly condition. 10. The landlord of a lodging-house shall cause every drain or means of drainage with which any watercloset belonging tosuch house may communicate to be maintained at all times in good order and efficient action. He shall also cause all such means of ventilation as may be provided in or in connection therewith to be maintained at all times in good order. 11.—Every lodger in a lodging-house shall cause all solid or liquid filth to be removed once at least in every day from every room which has been let to him, and shall once at least in every day cause every vessel, utensil, or other receptacle for such filth or refuse to be thoroughly cleansed. 12.

Provided that the foregoing requirement with respect to the lime-washing of the internal surface of the walls of rooms, staircases, and passages, shall not apply in any case where the internal surface of any such wall is painted, or where the material of or with which such surface is constructed or covered is such as to render the lime-washing thereof unsuitable or inexpedient, and where such surface is thoroughly cleansed, and the paint or other covering is renewed, if the renewal thereof be necessary for the purpose of keeping the premises in a cleanly and wholesome condition. 16. The landlord of a lodging-house shall provide adequate means of ventilation in or in connexion with every common passage or staircase in such house, and shall cause such means of ventilation to be maintained at all times in good order. 17. The landlord of a lodging-house shall cause all such means of ventilation as may be provided in or in connexion with any room in such house to be maintained at all times in good order. 18. In every case where, in pursuance of any statutory provision in that behalf, an order of a justice has been obtained for the removal from a lodging-house to a hospital of a person who is suffering from any dangerous infectious disease and is without proper lodging or accommodation, the landlord of such house, and the lodger to whom any room whereof such person may be an occupant has been let shall, on being informed of such order, forthwith take all such steps as may be requisite on the part of 32 such landlord and of such lodger, respectively, to secure the safe and prompt removal of such person in compliance with such order, and shall, in and about such removal, adopt all such precautions as, in accordance with any instructions which such landlord and such lodger respectively may receive from the Medical Officer of Health of the Sanitary Authority, may be most suitable for the circumstances of the case. Penalties. 19. Every person who shall offend against any of the foregoing bye-laws shall be liable for every such offence to a penalty of five pounds, and in the case of a continuing offence to a further penalty of forty shillings for each day after written notice of the offence from the Sanitary Authority. Provided, nevertheless, that the justices or court before whom any complaint may be made or any proceedings may be taken in respect of any such offence, may, if they think fit, adjudge the payment as a penalty of any sum less than the full amount of the penalty imposed by this bye-law. Repeal of Regulations. 20. From and after the date of the confirmation of these bye-laws, the Regulations relating to Houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family, which were made by the Board of Works for the Greenwich District on the sixth day of August in the year one thousand eight hundred and eighty-four, and were confirmed by the Local Government Board on the nineteenth day of August in the year one thousand eight hundred and eighty-four shall be repealed. During the latter part of the year the Metropolitan Asylums Board's South-Eastern Hospital was so overcrowded that patients 33 had to wait their turn for admission; this caused a great deal of inconvenience, and it is very difficult to judge the number of extra cases that must have been caused in consequence of those suffering from infectious diseases not being speedily isolated. The hospital authorities, however, issued the following circular: "Metropolitan Asylums Board. "Norfolk House, "Norfolk Street, W.C. "26th November, 1896. "Dear Sir, "It having been found impossible to receive immediately into any of the Fever Hospitals under the control of this Board the case of Diphtheria for whose removal you have made application, I forward herewith a Warrant for the delivery to the Medical Practitioner attending the case, upon application to the Medical Superintendent of any of the Institutions named on the back thereof, of one bottle of anti-toxic serum for use in the treatment of the patient. "Before the anti-toxic serum can be obtained, it will be necessary for the certificate at the foot of the Warrant to be signed. "If a further supply of serum be required, application must be made to me for another Warrant. "Yours faithfully, "T. DUNCOMBE MANN, "Clerk to the Board." It will thus be seen that medical practitioners could, upon making application in the form indicated, obtain a supply of antitoxic serum for their use in diphtheria cases. The question of the Water Supply being one of such great importance, the reprint I give here of the Report of The Lancet Special Commission on the Metropolitan Water Supply, with regard to the Kent Water Works Company will, I think, be not only interesting, but will be serviceable, if only for a reference. C 34 KENT WATERWORKS COMPANY. History. The Kent Waterworks Company possesses the rights of an old-established institution which dates back to the reign of William III. The present Company has also absorbed quite a number of small undertakings which have been started at different times since. In 1701 Letters Patent were granted at the request of the inhabitants of Sayes Court and East Greenwich, giving to the patentees liberty to break up streets and grounds in those places for the purpose of laying pipes to convey water, and a monopoly was granted for this work, all other persons being prohibited under pains and penalties for a period of 500 years from interfering with the water-supply in these parishes. The result of this privilege was that waterworks were made at Ravensbourne, and these continued to be worked till the year 1808. In the following year an Act was passed incorporating the proprietors of the waterworks, and it was provided that the Company should buy the letters patent which had been granted by William III. and the rights and privileges which belonged to them and the works which were already in existence. The Act of 1809 prohibited the Company from supplying water in such a way as to directly or indirectly affect those rights without the consent in writing of the people concerned or till the old waterworks were bought. Ultimately the patent was bought and "The Company of Proprietors of Kent Waterworks" became, under the provision of the Act, possessed of all the privileges, authorities, duties, and offices, given by the letters patent. The manors of Sayes Court and East Greenwich included the towns of Greenwich, Deptford, and the adjoining districts, and under the Act of 1809 the authorized limits of supply were the two parishes of Deptford and the parishes of Greenwich, Lee, Lewisham, and Rotherhithe. A year before this Act of Incorporation was passed the Town Commissioners of Woolwich had obtained Parliamentary powers to supply the town of Woolwich with water, and in 1810 the Commissioners came to an arrangement by which this work should be taken over by the Kent Company should the necessary sanction of Parliament be granted. The Act passed in 1811 authorized this 35 transfer. The area of supply was thus increased to include Woolwich, Plumstead, Charlton, Bermondsey, Peckham, and Peckhamrye, and arrangements were made about the same time that the Company should supply various Government establishments. The Ordnance Department at Woolwich and the Artillery Barracks of the garrison were first supplied, and later contracts were made for the supply of the Royal Arsenal, the Admiralty establishments, the Dockyard at Woolwich, the Royal Observatory, the Royal Naval Hospital, and His Majesty's Dockyard and Victualling Yard at Deptford. As in the case of some other companies, the profits made were for a time chiefly used in the outlay necessarily involved in extending the area of supply. In 1850 and 1852 Acts were passed enabling the Company to increase their capital. About the middle of the present century an establishment called the Plumstead, Woolwich, and Charlton Consumers' Pure Water Company was started. A well was constructed, and the necessary plant was put up by the Company, which, however, afterwards became bankrupt, when the plant was bought by the Kent Waterworks Company. In 1860 the North Kent Company was started with an idea of supplying Dartford, Crayford, Bexley, Wickham, Erith, Eltham, Chislehurst, and Bromley. The business of this undertaking was taken over by the Kent Company in 1864, and at the same time fresh capital was raised, and a schedule of water-rates was prescribed. The Company's area now included the places just mentioned. In 1867 the Local Board of Dartford sold their waterworks, which were acquired by the Kent Company, and the Company's area was thus extended to a district having a total area of about sixty-eight square miles. In 1877 the Bromley Rural Sanitary Authority requested the Kent Company to supply their district, and the Dartford Rural Sanitary Authority made a similar request. The result was that the Kent Waterworks Act of 1877 was passed and extended the limit of supply to the following places, viz.:— Swanscombe, Stone, Darenth, Wilmington, Sutton-at-Hone, Farningham, Eynsford, Foots Cray, North Cray, St. Paul's Cray, St. Mary Cray, Orpington, Farnborough, Chelsfield, Keston, West Wickham and Hayes, and the portion of Beckenham known as 36 Shortlands. The Company's district of supply was thus extended to an area of 120 square miles. In 1885 the Bromley and the Sevenoaks Rural Sanitary Authorities requested the Kent Waterworks Company to supply parts of their districts. The necessary Act of Parliament was obtained in 1888, and the Company's limits of supply were thus extended to an area of about one hundred and seventy-eight square miles, of which about thirty only are within the County of London, the remainder being in the County of Kent. When the Company as at present constituted began their business by taking over the Ravensbourne Waterworks the undertaking was a comparatively small affair. The works were situated on the banks of the river, and consisted of a pump which was worked by a water-wheel. The machinery was designed by Smeaton. The water was distributed through wooden pipes. A few years later a pair of steam-engines were put up by Boulton and Watt, and these engines are still working. Unfiltered water was used till the year 1844, when the first filter bed was made, and in 1850 a subsidence reservoir was constructed, and more filter beds were constructed. The reservoir is still in existence; it is situated to the west of the river, but it has for years been disused as a source of water supply, and remains as a piece of ornamental water in the garden of the engineer. The water of the Ravensbourne was insufficient to afford a supply, and in 1857 a deep well was sunk in the chalk. An abundant quantity of pure water was found, and from the year 1862 the entire district of the Company has been supplied by well-water. New wells have been sunk as occasion required. All of them are in the chalk, except the one at Westerham, which is in the lower greensand. Geology Of The District. In the case of the metropolitan water companies of which an account has hitherto been given it will be remembered that, with one exception, the water used by the companies comes either from the River Thames or from the gravel beds near the Thames. The only well which has been referred to is the one at Streatham, which belongs to the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks 37 pany. A full description of the strata cut through in making this well has been given in The Lancet (March 27th, pp. 902-3). The Kent Waterworks Company derives all the water supplied from deep wells; it is therefore of interest to note the geological character of the district. The Company's area is bounded on the north by the River Thames, and to the south it extends beyond the North Downs. A diagram shows the arrangement of the geological strata. At the extreme south Westerham is on the lower greensand, a formation which contains extremely good water, much less hard than the water found in chalk formation. Passing northwards there is next a narrow layer of gault, an almost impervious clay formation; then farther northwards there is a narrow band of upper greensand. Still farther northwards is the range of the North Downs, which run in a direction nearly due east and west, the eastern end running to the sea just south of Deal. In a westerly direection the downs run just to the north of Reigate and Dorking to Guildford, and from the west of Guildford towards Farnham. Near Westerham, the crest of the chalk escarpment is generally over 600 ft. above the sea level. The ground falls from the crest sharply to the south; towards the north and the north-east the slope is more gentle. The diagram shows the position of two of the chalk wells, at Orpington and Crayford, and the position of the river beds of the Cray, the Darent, and the Thames. On the North Downs there are patches of clay with flints and loam. These patches are irregularly distributed. From Westerham to Orpington the section shown in the diagram runs in a north-north-easterly direction; from Orpington to Purfleet the section runs in a north-easterly direction. Between Orpington and the line of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway there are springs. There are patches of lower tertiary beds between this point and Crayford, which is on the chalk. The depth of the level of water in the chalk varies. For example, at the present time the level of the well at Orpington is about 60 ft. below the surface of the ground. In a dry summer the level has been as low as 90 ft. below the surface. In 38 ting the water-bearing capacity of a district like that described it is necessary to know not only the area but the amount of rainfall, and it must be borne in mind that to be on the safe side it is necessary to reckon only the percolation which would take place during a dry year. Through a chalk district water finds its way to the sea in different ways. Some of the water rises in springs which break out at the foot of the chalk escarpment; some of it in wet seasons breaks out in streams in the higher levels, but during dry periods these streams do not run at all. Some, again, breaks out in springs in the lower ground. Much water, however, passes in underground channels; through chalk its passage is slow. Some of this underground water passes through fissures and in the lines in which flints occur. It passes also in large amount through faults in the chalk, which are water-bearing channels. It may be remarked in passing that a well which happens to be sunk in the course of one of these faults will afford a bountiful supply; and headings which are made in connexion with the deep wells in the chalk are made more or less in the hope of coming across one of these channels. The average of the rainfall over the district is estimated to be about 26 in. It is less than this over the lower ground, and at Greenwich is about 24 in., but on the higher levels it rises to 30 in. It is a difficult or impossible matter to determine how much of the rainfall is available for the supply of wells which are constantly pumped. At one time 6 in. a year of the total rainfall was supposed to be the amount which it was likely could be used. Later the estimate was considerably raised, when it was thought that as much as 12 in. might be available. The present amount of water used daily by the Kent Company is estimated at about 16,000,000 gallons. According to some evidence that was given before the last Royal Commission on the Metropolitan Water Supply it was stated that the Company's Parliamentary area would be likely to afford a supply of 30,000,000 to 40,000,000 gallons daily. Present State: General Description. The whole of the water supplied by the Kent Waterworks Company is obtained from deep wells and is delivered direct to 39 their customers. There are therefore no depositing reservoirs and no filter beds. The reservoirs of the Company are for the temporary storage of water. The stations of the Company are: Deptford, wells, pumping station, reservoirs, and offices; New Cross, reservoir; Woolwich Common, reservoir; Plumstead, well and pumping station; Plumstead Common, reservoir; Greenwich Park, reservoir; Chislehurst, reservoir; Shortlands, wells and pumping station; Crayford, wells and pumping station; Dover Road, Shooter's Hill, pumping station; Shooter's Hill, reservoir and stand-pipe; Farnborough, wells and pumping station; Cowlass Hill, Farnborough, reservoir; Dartford, reservoir; Layham Farm, West Wickham, reservoir; Knockholt, reservoir; Wilmington, wells and pumping station; Westerham, well, pumping station, and reservoir; Betsom's Hill, reservoir; Pilgrim's Way, well and pumping station; and Eltham, reservoir. There are two wells under construction. Deptford.—The station at Deptford is on the site of the original works of the company; part of it is to the east and part to the west of the River Ravensbourne. The part on the west side of the river consists of the offices of the company, the engineer's house, a well called the Garden Well, the old engine house, and a large garden containing the reservoir which was formerly used. The Ravensbourne is crossed by a bridge, on the site of the old water-wheel which was used for pumping. The fall in the Ravensbourne at this point is not now made use of. To the east of the river there is an enclosed space containing two wells (the New Well and the Bath Well), engine houses, and two covered reservoirs. This is the site of the filter beds which were used when the river was the source of the water supply. The Garden Well derives its name from its situation. The ground level here is 20 ft. above ordnance datum. The depth of the well is 100 ft., the diameter at the top is 15 ft., and at the lower part 12 ft. The upper 15 ft. are lined with brick, the lower part is lined with iron cylinders. There are some headings in this well and a bore-hole. The water from this well is pumped by some of the original machinery put up by Boulton and Watt. There are two engines of 50 horse-power (nominal), and these 40 work force-pumps, which raise 42 gallons per stroke and work at about the rate of sixteen strokes a minute. The steam is generated by three Cornish boilers. The water is pumped to the high-level district in connexion with the reservoir on Woolwich Common. The New Well was sunk in the year 1868. It is 100 ft. in depth and has headings. It is lined with iron cylinders to a depth of about 75 ft. The water is pumped by two Cornish engines; of these one works a lift-pump, which raises 300 gallons per stroke, and the other a force-pump, which distributes 200 gallons per stroke. The latter works against a head of 180 ft. and pumps the water to the reservoir at New Cross. The steam is generated by five Cornish boilers working at a pressure of 35 lb. The Bath Well gets its name from a neighbouring street, Cold Bath Street. It was sunk in the year 1874. The depth of the well is 100 ft. and it has headings which extend for 80 ft. to a bore-hole which is situated beneath a disused well. The diameter of the well is 10 ft. and the upper part is lined with iron cylinders to a depth of 70 ft. The water is raised by a Cornish engine (brought here from Charlton, dated 1859) which works a lift-pump and a force-pump. The lift-pump raises 240 gallons per stroke from the well, and of this water so raised the force-pump lifts 100 gallons per stroke to Greenwich Park, working against a head of from 150 to 160 ft. The remainder of the water raised by the lift-pump flows to the covered reservoir. The steam for the engine is generated by three Cornish boilers working at a pressure of 35 lb. Near the Bath Well is a disused engine house. There are two reservoirs capable of storing 2,000,000 gallons. The reservoirs are covered by concrete arches built on brick walls, and the arrangement of the walls insures a circulation of the water in the reservoir. According to the report given by the Secretary of the Company, the engines at Deptford have a total horse-power of 858. New Cross.—The station at New Cross is situated in Jerningham Road, Hatcham, not far from the church dedicated to St. James. It consists of a reservoir, built in brick, arched over, and covered with turf. It is capable of holding 1,750,000 gallons. The top water line is 163 ft. above ordnance datum. 41 Woolwich Common.—There is a covered reservoir on Woolwich Common. It is situated to the south-west of the Royal Military College, and to the south of the road between the College and the Herbert Hospital. The part of the Common which is occupied by the reservoir is enclosed by low iron railings to keep off cattle. The reservoir is of oblong form, covered by brick arches, and turfed over. It is capable of holding 1,500,000 gallons and is situated 248 ft. above ordnance datum. Plumstead.—The station at Plumstead consists of a well and pumping station. The well is 136 ft. in depth and is lined by brick to a depth of 78 ft., and there is a bore-hole 600 ft. in depth. When visited on March 25th the water level was 107 ft. below the surface. After pumping the level has been as low as 112 ft. below the surface. Usually the well is pumped for from twelve to sixteen out of the twenty-four hours. The water is pumped by a rotative engine of 60 horse-power, which works a pair of lift-pumps and four force-pumps driven through tooth gearing. The steam is generated by two Cornish boilers working at a pressure of 30 lb. The amount of water pumped daily averages about 750,000 gallons. From this well Plumstead and Woolwich are supplied directly, and some of the water goes to the reservoir on Plumstead Common. Plumstead Common.—The reservoir, built in the year 1854, is situated at a height of 170 ft. above ordnance datum. It is covered by brick arches which are supported by iron girders. The reservoir is divided into two parts internally. It is capable of holding 650,000 gallons. There is sufficient land here for another reservoir of the same size. Greenwich Park.—This reservoir is situated at the highest part of Greenwich Park, not far from the Royal Observatory. The original reservoir was built by the Admiralty to store water to be used in case of fire at the Dockyard, the Victualling Yard, or the Greenwich Hospital (now the Royal Naval College). It was made about the year 1845, just after a destructive fire had occurred at the Tower of London. The reservoir is circular in form, and is now covered over by brick arches which are supported by iron joists. It is capable of holding about 1,125,000 gallons, and the 42 top water-line is 158 ft. above ordnance datum. The water is used for the supply of Deptford and Greenwich. There is an electrical apparatus here connected with an index at the Deptford station which shows the height of the water in the reservoir, which it is necessary for the Company to know, because under the terms of their agreement with the Government Department a sufficient amount of water has to be constantly kept here, so that it may be available at all times in case of fire. The electrical apparatus was put up and is kept in working order by the Post Office authorities at the expense of the Company. Chislehurst.— This station is situated at the upper part of Bickley Park, near Chislehurst Common. There is a reservoir, built of brick, covered with arches and turfed over. It has a capacity of 450,000 gallons, and the top water line is 315 ft. above ordnance datum. The water is supplied from Shortlands, and is distributed to the Bromley district. Shortlands.— The station at Shortlands is situated 130 ft. above ordnance datum. There are here two deep wells sunk into the chalk. The wells are about 80 ft. in depth and lined with iron cylinders. From the bottom of the wells bore-holes pass to a depth of 200 ft. The natural water level is about 10 ft. below the surface of the ground. After pumping the level has sunk to a level of 34 ft. 6 in. below the surface. The amount of water pumped averages 2,250,000 gallons daily. It is raised from the well to the ground level by two lift-pumps and forced into the mains by two piston and plunger pumps, worked by two inverted Cornish engines, for which the steam is generated by four Cornish boilers. These wells supply Chislehurst reservoir, Deptford, and Lewisham. Crayford.—This station is situated 30 ft. above ordnance datum. There are three wells here. The one first made is 28 ft. in depth, the second 34 ft., and the third 48 ft. The wells are lined with iron cylinders. Each well has a bore-hole about 200 ft. in depth. Wells No. 2 and 3 are generally used. The water has been as low as 28 ft. below the surface in No. 2 and as low as 35 ft. below the surface in No. 3. At this station pumping is continuous, and the amount of water obtained averages 3,500,000 43 gallons daily. The water is raised to the surface by lift-pumps, and forced into the mains by three-throw plunger-pumps, worked by two rotative beam-engines. The steam is generated by six Cornish boilers. No. 2 engine pumps to the highlevel reservoir at Woolwich Common, and No. 3 to Plumstead and Woolwich. The well No. 1 is now not used. The pumping arrangements consist of a lift-pump and a direct acting forcepump, worked by a horizontal engine. The united horse-power of the three engines is 186 (nominal). Dover Road, Shooter s Hill.—There is a pumping station here. A pair of 24 horse-power horizontal engines work direct acting force-pumps for the supply of Shooter's Hill. Some of the water passes through a standpipe situated on the summit of the hill, and of which the highest point is about 470 feet above ordnance datum. The engines are worked for about six hours a day. Cotistitulion Hill, Shooter s Hill.—There is a reservoir here, covered with brick arches, capable, theoretically, of holding 300,000 gallons, but it is not filled. It stands at a level of 320 ft. above ordnance datum. The higher parts of Plumstead and Abbey Wood are supplied from this source. Fartiborough. The Farnborough station is situated 220 ft. above ordnance datum, near Orpington railway station on the South-Eastern Railway. The chalk is here about 30 ft. below the ground level. There are two deep wells about 15 ft. apart, but connected below by a gallery. The upper 30 ft. of the wells are bricked, and there are iron cylinders below this level. When visited on March 25th the water level was about 60 ft. below the surface of the ground. Occasionally in summer the water level is as low as 90 ft. below the surface. The average amount of water pumped daily is from 2,500,000 to 3,000,000 gallons. There are four engines and pumps at this station. A pair of plunger-pumps, worked by a double-cylinder Cornish engine of about 120 horse-power, pump water to Sidcup, Eltham, and Woolwich. A piston and plunger pump (No. 1), worked by a Cornish engine, pumps the water to Farnborough and Chislehurst. A small engine of the Worthington type is used for pumping to 44 the reservoir at West Wickham and to Keston. Another small engine of the Worthington type pumps water to Knockholt reservoir. The steam for these engines is generated by six Cornish boilers, four working at a pressure of 100 lb. and the other two at 35 lb. There is an apparatus at this station for softening the water used for the boilers. A workman's cottage is situated here. Cowlass Hill, Farnborough. —There is a reservoir at Cowlass Hill, near Farnborough. It is square in form, covered with brick arches, and turfed over. It is capable of holding 1,400,000 gallons. The top water level is 439 ft. above ordnance datum. Dartford. Here there is a reservoir of circular form, 60 ft. in diameter, and 20 ft. in depth. It is covered by arches of brick resting on rolled joists supported partly by a central iron column. The capacity of the reservoir is theoretically 370,000 gallons, but it is not filled. The top water level is 130 ft. above ordnance datum. West Wickham.—The station to which this name is given is situated close to the high road about three miles from the village of West Wickham, on Layham Farm. There is a circular reservoir covered with brick arches and turfed over. It has a capacity of 250,000 gallons. The top water level is 550 ft. above ordnance datum. The reservoir is enclosed by an iron fence. Knockholt.—The station is situated near to, but on higher ground than, the well-known Knockholt Beeches, which are a landmark for miles round. There is a reservoir, covered with brick arches and turfed over. The top water level is 795 ft. above ordnance datum. The water is pumped here from Farnborough, and is used for the supply of Knockholt, Brasted, and Westerham. Wilmington.—The station at Wilmington is situated at the extreme northern extremity of that parish, about a mile south of the town of Dartford, near the Dartford powder-mills, in the valley of the Darenth, and not far from the river. Two wells, pumping apparatus, and workmen's cottages, are situated here. The wells are about 100 ft, in depth, lined with iron cylinders, and bricked at the upper part. One of the wells (No. 1) has a 45 short gallery in the chalk. The other (No. 2) has a longer gallery ending in a bore-hole about 200 ft. in depth. The water level varies from 40 ft. to 80 ft. below the ground level, which is 30 ft. above ordnance datum. The amount of water pumped daily varies from 3,000,000 to 6,000,000 gallons. The water is pumped by a pair of compound rotative beam-engines of 260 horse-power, which work two lift-pumps for raising the water from the wells, and two pairs of force-pumps which send the water through a 24 in. main to Eltham reservoir. Westerham.—The Westerham station is situated on the outskirts of the Equerry's Park. It consists of a well 70 ft. in depth, pumping arrangements, and a reservoir. The water is pumped by an overshot water-wheel, and the stream which turns it has a fall of about 15 feet. The amount of water pumped daily is about 25,000 gallons. It is pumped to a reservoir situated on an eminence hard by, at a height of 444 ft. above ordnance datum. The reservoir is a covered one, and is capable of holding 60,000 gallons. The village of Westerham is supplied partly from this source and partly from Knockholt. Betsom's Hill.—This hill forms part of the North Downs, and on the map the station is marked too far to the east. It is nearer the boundary. There is here a covered reservoir, built of concrete, capable of holding 68,000 gallons. The top water line is 818 ft. above ordnance datum. The reservoir supplies a few houses on the hill. The water is pumped as occasion requires by a portable engine from a well situated at the foot of the downs, close to the Pilgrim's Way and the boundary between the counties of Kent and Surrey. Eltham.—The station at Eltham is situated at the eastern end of the village of that name, at a height of 240 ft. above ordnance datum. There is a circular reservoir, covered with brick arches, capable of holding 3,000,000 gallons. The internal arrangements of the reservoir insure a circulation of the water, which comes in at the outer circle and makes three circuits before it passes out at the centre. All the water is pumped into and passes out of the reservoir every day. The property here is about three acres in extent and there is room for another reservoir of 46 the same size. There is a garden, enclosed on three sides by a high brick wall. There is also a small house between the reservoir and the road. Communication with other Companies' mains.—There is no communication with the mains of any other company. Length of new pipes.—The length of new pipes ranging from 3 in. to 20 in. laid in 1895 was 10½ miles, and during the year 1896 was 15⅛ miles. Hydrants.—The number of hydrants erected during the year 1895 was 274, and during the year 1896 it was 613. Houses under constant supply.—The number of houses under constant supply on Dec. 31st, 1894, was 61,312; on Dec. 31st, 1895, 66,750; and on Dec. 31st, 1896, 71,463. Percentage of houses under constant supply.—On Dec. 31st, 1896, the percentage of houses under constant supply was 85. Average daily supply per head.—The average daily supply per head for the year 1896 was 32.17 gallons. These figures are arrived at by the Company as follows:—average daily supply, 16,069,991 ; average population, 500,286. The difference between the figures given by the Company and those given by the water examiner appointed by the Local Government Board is caused by the fact that whereas the Secretary to the Company makes no allowance for "slip quantities in the pumps," an allowance for this is made by the water examiner to the Local Government Board. Date of maximum and minimum supply.—The following table gives the date of the maximum and minimum supplies and the average daily quantities supplied:— Year 1895. Year 1896. Mouth. Quantity in gallons. Month. Quantity in gallons. Maximum June 19,875,709 July 19,392,072 Minimum December 15,156,144 November 14,621,294 47 Communication between the Company's stations.—With the exception of the electric communication between the Greenwich reservoir and the Deptford station there is no direct communication between the Company's various stations.

Table No. 11 gives the Meteorological Statistics for London for the year 1896. The Sanitary Sub-Committee, I regret to say, has lost two of its members during the year: their death is a great loss to the Committee, as both were good practical men and conscientious sanitarians. I am pleased to say that the work which the Committee continues to do is of inestimable value, their desire being to assist and support any measure with efficiency and economy that has a tendency to ameliorate the lives of the poor, to curb the ravages of disease, and to secure for all pure air, food, and water. They have made house-to-house inspections in different parts of the district—Kentfield Place, Heston Street; Florence Grove, Wilson Street; Fisher's Rents and Bowman's Cottages, Summer Street; and Slowgrove Cottages, Charles Street; and I am greatly indebted for their combined support. I desire to express my entire satisfaction at the zeal and energy with which the Sanitary Inspectors have discharged their duties during the year. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HENRY WILLIAM ROBERTS, January, 1897, Medical Officer of Health, Deptford. Summary of Vital and Mortal Statistics for 1896.

To the Greenwich District Board of Works. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Fourteenth Annual Report, for the 53 weeks ending January 2nd, 1897. I have to report that 1,860 Births (942 Males and 918 Females) were registered in the Greenwich District, details of which appear in the tabulated form No. 1. The number of Deaths was 1,478 (825 Males and 653 Females) equivalent to an annual rate of 24.3 per 1,000 persons living (including the Greenwich Union and Infirmary, the Seamen's, Miller and Cottage Hospitals, the Royal Naval College, and Greenwich Hospital Schools, and the outlying Public Institutions), and 12.8 excluding these Public Institutions, details of which appear in the tabulated form No. 2. The number of Deaths from the principal Zymotic Class was G 66 245, equivalent to an annual rate of 4.0 per 1.000 persons living, details of which appear in the tabulated form No. 3. The Births were 1,860, being 382 in excess of the number of Deaths, equivalent to an annual rate of 30.6 per 1,000 persons living, details of which appear in the tabulated form No. 4. Table No. 5 will show the comparative Death Rate per 1,000 (excluding Hospitals and Schools,) for the past 12 years. Table No. 6 will show the comparative Death Rate per 1,000 from Diseases of a Zymotic type for the last ten years. Table No. 7 will show the Population and Births and Deaths, in Registration Districts, during the 52 weeks of 1896. Table No. 8 will show the number of cases of Infectious Disease reported to me under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, during the 52 weeks ending 1896. Table No. 9 will show the number of cases of Infectious Disease and Deaths notified to the Metropolitan Asylums Board by the several Medical Officers of Health of the Metropolis, under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in the 52 weeks ending 1896. Table No. 10 will show the number of Articles and Rooms disinfected from March 25th, 1896, to March 25th, 1897. Table No. 11 will show the number of articles destroyed during the same period. Table No. 12 will show the number of houses inspected, with inquiries in connection with Infectious Diseases, from March 25th, 1896, to March 25$. 1897. 67 Table No. 13 will show the work of Inspection from March 25th, 1896, to March 25th, 1897. Table No. 14 will show the Improvements effected during the same period. INFLUENZA. Although Sporadic cases of Influenza have occurred frequently during the year, I am happy to state that there has been nothing like an Epidemic, and the mortality, in consequence, is much lower than last year. During 1895 there were 51 Deaths, and this year 13 only. The following figures show the number of deaths that have been registered from Influenza in the Greenwich District since 1890:— 1890 4 1892 33 1894 11 1891 44 1893 28 1895 51 1896 13 The Registrar-General, in his Annual Report for 1896, states:— "That the deaths referred to Influenza in the course of the year amounted to 496, a number which is considerably smaller than in any year since 1890, the first year of the Epidemic in London." The deaths referred to Influenza in the year 1895 were 2,156 in number. CHOLERA. I am happy to state that during the year 1896 there was not a case of Cholera reported as having occurred in this district. 68 ZYMOTIC DISEASES. I stated in my Annual Report of 1888-9, that it was customary to regard the absence or prevalence of disease of a Zymotic type as a test of the Sanitary condition of a district, and I was justified in congratulating the Board upon the satisfactory state of the Parish of Greenwich, as the Death Rate amounted to only l.6 per 1,000 from that class of disease. This year, the Death Rate amounts to 4.0 per 1,000 as against 2.2 of last year. Scarlet Fever. I regret to state that (in common with other parts of the Metropolis) there has been a considerable increase in the number of Notifiable Diseases during the year in the Parish of Greenwich, and more particularly so with Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. Last year there were 256 cases of Scarlet Fever notified, and six deaths, and this year 394 cases and 21 deaths, 12 of which occurred in the outlying districts. The following may be of interest:— 1893 417 Notified Cases 12 Deaths 1894 270 „ „ 11 „ 1895 256 „ „ 6 „ 1896 394 „ „ 21 „ Enteric or Typhoid Fever. Last year there were 38 cases of Enteric Fever reported, and 7 deaths. This year the number is 37, the fatal cases being 16. Erysipelas still shows a decrease, compared with that of last year. 1893—140 cases. 1894—96. 1895—65. 1896—61. 69 Measles. This disease used to be looked upon as one of the most simple of the Zymotic class, but of late years the complications (principally of the Respiratory Organs) arising therefrom have been so numerous as to suggest that it is more fatal than Scarlet Fever. In London, Measles appear to have been more fatal during 1896 than in any previous year on record, with the single exception of 1864. There were 57 deaths from Measles and its complications in 1896, against 25 last year. 1893—27. 1894—38. 1895—25. 1896—57. In the opinion of many Medical Officers of Health, Measles should be reported under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in the place of Erysipelas. At the present time, enquiry is being made by the Medical Officer to the London County Council as to the desirability of notification. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. Diphtheria cases have increased from 215 to 400, but the deaths from that disease are much smaller in proportion, being 59 against 41; the decrease being due (to the best of my belief) to its earlier recognition and subsequent treatment by means of injecting with anti-toxin. The following extract and table is taken from the RegistrarGeneral's Annual Summary for 1896:— "Diphtheria was the assigned cause of 2,683 deaths in the course of the year 1896. These deaths were equal to a rate of 0.60 per 1,000, against rates of 0.76, 0.62, and 0.54 per 1,000 in the three previous years. "The London Death Rate from Diphtheria in 1896 70 siderably exceeded the average rate in the ten years 1886-95, which had been 0.41 per 1,000. The deaths from Diphtheria and Croup together numbered 2,830, and were 538 above the average. The local Mortality from Diphtheria is very seriously disturbed by the existence of Hospitals in certain of the areas. In Hampstead, for example, 250 deaths from Diphtheria were registered in 1896; most of these occurred in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospital, to which the patients had been admitted from other districts, and, after distribution of institution deaths, only 30 were of persons belonging to Hampstead sanitary area. Similarly, in Fulham sanitary area 200 deaths from Diphtheria were registered, most of these being Hospital cases imported from outside districts, and only 77 properly belonged to Fulham. Hackney, City of London, Holborn, St. Olave, Wandsworth, Greenwich, and Lee are also instances of sanitary areas whose registered Death Rates from Diphtheria have been enormously increased by the presence of Hospitals. On the other hand, Chelsea, Clerkenwell, St. Luke, St. George-in-the-East, Mile End Old Town, St. Saviour (Southwark), Bermondsey, Camberwell, Lewisham, and Woolwich, may be mentioned as examples of the opposite kind, where the effect of distribution has been to greatly increase the Diphtheria Death Rates of those areas by the inclusion of deaths occurring in Hospitals outside their own boundaries. "Among London sanitary areas the lowest Death Rates from Diphtheria, after distribution of institution deaths, were 0.09 in St. James, Westminster, 0.12 in Strand, 0.18 in St. Giles, and 0.21 in Wandsworth; the highest rates were 0.83 in Limehouse, 0.84 in Bermondsey, 0.86 in Mile End Old Town, 0.88 in Lewisham, 0.91 in Plumstead, 1.01 in Camberwell, and 1.17 in Chelsea. 71 " The following table shows the Death Rates from Diphtheria in each of the London sanitary areas from the year 1887 to 1896:— DEATHS from DIPHTHERIA, per 1000 living, in each of the METROPOLITAN SANITARY AREAS during the Ten Years 1887-96, after distribution of Deaths in Public Institutions.

The subject is receiving marked attention from all those who are engaged in Public Health work. The following table will show the number of notifications of Diphtheria that have been received by me since 1890, and also the number of deaths that have occurred from that disease during each year since:— Notified cases of Diphtheria. Deaths from Diphtheria. 1890 53 1890 26 1891 48 1891 21 1892 43 1892 9 1893 170 1893 51 1894 139 1894 38 1895 215 1895 41 1896 400 1896 59 In both England and London the mortality from Diphtheria was less in the decade 1871.80 than in 1861.70, but in the decade 1881.90 it was greater than in the second, and in London had increased to a higher ratio even than in the first decade. Comparing London to England in the first decade, the ratio of mortality was about 5 per cent. lower than that of England, in the second decade about equal, and in the third about 6 per cent. higher. It is strange that whilst formerly it was more prevalent in the rural districts, it now appears to affect the urban most. 73 In the Greenwich District most of the cases were confined to young children of school age. Some years ago this disease used to be confined to the eastern part of the Parish, especially in the Marsh district, but this year it has visited every part. I believe that, owing to the highly infectious character of this disease, it is largely spread in Schools. Sir Thome Thome (Medical Officer to the Local Government Board), in his Milroy Lectures on Diphtheria in 1891, showed that since 1871, whereas the annual Death Rates from all causes from the seven principal Zymotic diseases, and from Enteric Fever, have been steadily falling in England and Wales, in large towns, and in London, the annual Death Rates from Diphtheria have been rising, slightly in England and Wales, more markedly in the large towns, and most markedly in London. Whilst the mortality of Diphtheria is still steadily rising, that of Enteric Fever is equally steadily falling pari passu with improved sanitation, and the mortality of Scarlet Fever is also falling pari passu with increased Hospital isolation; so that whereas the improvement of sanitation markedly decreases the mortality of Enteric Fever, it appears to have no effect on Diphtheria. To what cause may this increase of Diphtheria be due ? Many have been suggested. 1. School influence. 2. Sewer ventilation and unsanitary conditions. 3. Alteration in classification (particularly with regard to Membranous Croup), now being classified with Diphtheria. 4 Connection with other throat affections. 74 School Influence. In 1870 the Elementary Education Act was passed for the establishment of School Boards and Elementary Schools. Now, whereas during the decade 1861-70, the number of deaths from Diphtheria decreased annually, during that of 1871-80 they increased annually. Sir Thorne Thorne has so fully and so carefully entered into this subject of . School Influence "that his conclusion that increased school attendance has had a material influence in increasing the spread of Diphtheria is irresistible. Although I am of opinion that "School Influence" has been a potent cause of the spread of Diphtheria, I cannot charge "School Influence" with being the sole cause of the great increase that has occurred since the year 1893. I would rather suggest that the great increase is primarily due to one of those peculiar waves that come over us in the form of an epidemic, the cause of which is unknown at the present time. I have no doubt but that in the course of time much useful knowledge on the means of spread will be discovered both by the chemist and the bacteriologist. Whilst such men as Sir William Jenner and Dr. Wilkes on the one side believe that the disease is in the main independent of sanitary conditions or hygienic circumstances, and whilst Sir George Johnson is diametrically opposed to their particular views, it behoves us to look further afield for the cause. I am inclined to think that our main drainage is faulty. The main drainage system was laid in 1863, and the engineer (the late Sir Joseph Bazalgette) made a statement at 75 the time of its completion that it would last for 25 years, and at the end of that time (with the rapidly increasing population) it would be necessary to enquire closely whether it could not be capable of improvement. ANTI.TOXIC SERUM TREATMENT FOR DIPHTHERIA. It is gratifying to know that the mortality from Diphtheria is much lower since the use of the "Anti.toxic Serum." The deaths from that disease have considerably diminished since its introduction and subsequent application. A very exhaustive report on the subject has recently been published by the Medical Superintendents of the Metropolitan Asylum Board's Hospitals, the summary of which I append:— " The improved results in the Diphtheria cases treated during the year 1896, which are indicated by the foregoing statistics and clinical observations, are— (i.) A great reduction in the mortality of cases brought under treatment on the first and second day of illness. (ii.) The lowering of the combined general mortality to a point below that of any former year. (iii.) The still more remarkable reduction in the mortality of the laryngeal cases. (iv.) The uniform improvement in the results of tracheotomy at each separate Hospital. (v.) The beneficial effect produced on the clinical course of the disease. 76 "We have had, in fact, somewhat better results to record for 1896 than we had for 1895; and, in view of the extended experience gained during the past year, together with the additional facts concerning the post scarlatinal cases for 1896, we feel that we are fully justified in the favourable opinion we expressed last year on the value of anti-toxin in the treatment of Diphtheria. "We would repeat what we stated last year as to the paramount importance of commencing the treatment early—if possible, not later than the second day of the disease. From this time onward the chance of a successful issue will diminish in proportion to the length of time which has elapsed before the treatment is commenced. This, though true of other methods, is of still greater moment in the case of treatment by anti.toxin. " We have already drawn attention to the trivial nature of the secondary effects that not infrequently arise as a direct result of the injection of anti.toxic serum, and we think that neither these effects nor the increased incidence of some of the usual complications are worthy of being considered practical deterrents when the beneficial results of the treatment are remembered. "We have only to add that we still hold to the opinion that in the anti.toxic serum we possess a remedy of distinctly—we would not say much—greater value in the treatment of Diphtheria than any other with which we are acquainted." Whooping Cough. Reference to Table No. 3 will show that 46 children died from this disease in the district, being an increase of 47 under last year. Whooping Cough is a disease peculiar to young children, and it is difficult to suggest any particular Sanitary measures which, in the absence of isolation, would tend to lessen its spread. 77 The increase in the number of deaths from the two diseases, viz., Measles and Whooping Cough, have been the cause of the high Zymotic Death Rate for 1896. Diarrhœa. There were 38 deaths from this disease (including Infantile Diarrhœa), being a decrease of 7 over last year. This disease is accelerated by bad feeding, and it is most fatal during the hot weather, and more especially so during the period of Dentition. Small Pox. Three cases only of Small Pox were reported to me during 1896. One of these proved fatal, and that occurred in the Hospital. I notified every case to the Board of Guardians through their Vaccination Officer. The necessary Sanitary precautions were observed in every ease by Inspection, Disinfection, Destruction of Bed, Bedding, &c., and the serving of Notices to abate Nuisances. Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the following diseases are scheduled :— Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Membranous Croup, Small Pox, Cholera, Erysipelas; and Puerperal, Typhus, Enteric, and Relapsing Fevers. Under this Act it is compulsory for the Medical Attendant and the householder (in which the case occurs) to notify to the Medical Officer of Health of the District immediately upon the outbreak of any of the above diseases. Reference to Table No. 8 will show the number of cases reported during the year 1896. 78 GENERAL REMARKS. Sewer Ventilators. During the past year I have received complaints from all parts of the Parish respecting the smell that arises from the Sewer Ventilators. I have on each occasion forwarded these complaints to the Medical Officer of the London County Council. In order to abate the nuisance there should be more ventilators erected, and they should be carried up to a considerable height, instead of being at ground level. In one case this has been done, viz., in the Trafalgar Road, near Christ Church, with considerable benefit to that locality. The following houses have been either closed or demolished during the year, owing to their being unfit for human habitation : 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19, Hoskin Street Demolished. Notices were served upon the owners, and rather than have them repaired, they were pulled down. 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10, Caradoc Street {Closed by order of the Magistrate, who visited the property. Cottage at rear of 38, Roan Street} Closed on receipt of Notices. Oak House, East Street. Under Section 60, Sub-section 4, of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 : "The Sanitary Authority shall provide, free of charge, temporary shelter or house 79 accommodation, with any necessary attendants, for the members of any family, in which any dangerous infectious disease has appeared, who have been compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority." The above house was purchased by the Board for the use of the Greenwich District (which includes the Parish of Deptford), and a caretaker was engaged to take charge. The house has been partly furnished, and during the year was inhabited by 11 families—Deptford, 2 ; Greenwich, 9. The number of deaths of infants under one year during 1896 was 283 = 4.6 per 1,000. Last year, 1895, there were 266, and the Death Rate was equal to 4.2 per 1,000. Seventy.two deaths of persons aged 80 and upwards were registered during the year, being a decrease of 112 as compared with that of last year. During the year I visited the Slaughter.houses and Cow.sheds, and found them in a satisfactory condition. The Bakehouses were also inspected, and those that were in an unsanitary condition reported to the Board. I have much pleasure in stating that your Sanitary Inspectors (Messrs. Wilson and Fisher) have been of great assistance to me. They have discharged their onerous duties with zeal, intelligence, and success. The appointment of a Sanitary Inspector to carry out the duties in connection with the notification of Infectious Disease 80 under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, has been of much service, and I have pleasure in stating that Mr. Bache has conducted the work to my entire satisfaction. In conclusion, I desire to thank the members of the Board for their uniform courtesy, and their willingness at all times to assist me by adopting any suggestions that I have made tending to improve the sanitary condition of the district. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, CHARLES HENRY HARTT, Medical Officer of Health. TABLE No. 1. 1896. BIRTHS. DEATHS. AGES AT TIME OF DEATH. CAUSES. M. F. Total. M. F.
