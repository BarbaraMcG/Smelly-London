AC4361 CuR 7/1/52 1950 ANNUAL REPORT on the HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITIONS of the METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ISLINGTON. VICTOR FREEMAN, m.r.c.s., l.r.c.p., d.p.h., Medical Officer of Health. VAIL, & Co., LTD., Printers. 170 Farringdon Road, E.C.1 1 Public Health Department, Town Hall, N.l. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, of the Metropolitan Borough of Islington. I have the honour and privilege of presenting my Tenth Annual Report on the health of the Metropolitan Borough of Islington for the year ended 31st December, 1950. Progress in preventive medicine is not spectacular, but nevertheless each year brings some small addition to one aspect or another of the health services, so that when we look back, even only over a few years, it is possible to see that substantial improvements have been effected. Measured by the general death rate and the low infant mortality, the health of the Borough can be regarded as satisfactory. This, however, is far from indicating that improvements and, in some respects, considerable improvements are not desirable and cannot be effected with further efforts. It is satisfactory, for example, to record that, after a post-war increase for several years in the number of new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis notified each year, 1950 has shown a decrease. With approximately 500 new cases of respiratory tuberculosis during the year there is obviously room for considerable further improvements as regards the major infectious disease of our times. Tuberculosis is an illness in which social circumstances play a considerable part. If the tuberculous patient, having been diagnosed, cannot obtain rapid admission to hospital or sanatorium for treatment, and if any tuberculous patient under observation or treatment, has to share a bedroom with other members of the family because there is no other room available, then both the patient and the community will have to pay very heavily. I again have occasion in my Annual Report to refer to the difficulties of the housing situation in Islington. The long list of successful prosecutions under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, for failure to abate statutory nuisances, is in itself evidence of the difficulties with which owners are now faced in their statutory obligation to maintain, in a habitable condition, property which is largely out-of-date. Although the Council and the London County Council are providing new housing in substantial volume, it is doubtful whether such new housing even keeps pace with the wear and tear in old housing. In some instances owners have abandoned their properties through financial inability to maintain them in a habitable condition. Although it has not yet been possible to resume slum clearance, there have been preliminary surveys in anticipation of resumption in the near future, even though this may have to be initially on a limited scale. Infectious disease, in general, is decreasing, but the two exceptions are poliomyelitis and food poisoning. 1950 was a year in which the number of cases of poliomyelitis in the Borough were considerably greater than in pre-war years, although less than in 1949. The extent of food poisoning does not depend so much on medical control as on public insistence of good hygiene standards in food establishments, and the intelligent application by all those concerned in the handling 2 of food (and there are a very large number of them) of the elementary principles of hygiene, having regard to the nature of the materials they are handling and the fact that they are intended for human consumption. Opinion, both medical and lay, is not unanimous on the necessity or desirability of a Clean Food Guild, or its equivalent in every area. In any case the success of such a Guild is dependent upon the wholehearted co-operation of the local food traders and there is not unanimity among the food traders on this matter. Health, including food hygiene, publicity has been increased during the year and the Sanitary Inspectors as well as being statutory officers under the various Acts must necessarily also be hygiene officers from the educational angle. There was one diphtheria death in the Borough and this was of a non-immunised child. A scheme was approved during the year for dealing with infestation of houses by bugs, by means of the systematic inspection of houses, in addition to treatment after confirmation of complaint. It is hoped that the extension of such systematic inspection, similar in principle to the block control scheme in rodent disinfestation, and consequent treatment, will ultimately result in a very great reduction in the number of houses infested by bugs. The application of modern insecticides makes the virtual elimination of this type of infestation theoretically possible. The needs of elderly persons were also further considered during the year within the Council's limited powers. A scheme was approved to supply, through the Islington Women's Voluntary Services, hot midday meals to old people unable to fend for themselves. Many old people suffer from some degree of malnutrition owing to their inability to buy or prepare food in adequate quantities, and such a service as this is therefore truly preventive. The Report also mentions an arrangement made in liaison with the Family Welfare Association and the National Assistance Board for ensuring that elderly persons who have to be cleansed, are also furnished with clean clothing and clean bedding before returning home. Staff sickness and inevitable difficulties in maintaining a full establishment, both in regards to clerical and inspectorial staff, placed a heavy burden on the remainder and I again have pleasure in expressing my thanks and indebtedness to all members of the staff, and in particular to Mr. W. C. Bartlett, Chief Sanitary Inspector and to the Chief Clerk, Mr. E. J. Sharp. Many difficult problems have had to be considered by the Public Health and Housing Committees and I must again express my thanks to the respective Chairmen of the Committees, Councillor Mrs. F. H. Cantwell, J.P. and Councillor D. McArthurJackson, J.P. V. FREEMAN, Medical Officer of Health. 3 MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE (As at December 1050) Mayor: Councillor T. W. Isaacs, J.P.

Births. The birth-rate continues to fall from the post-war peak of 23.55 per thousand population in 1947 to 17.17 for 1950. Illegitimate Births. In the report for 1949 it was observed that post-war social factors were possibly tending to stabilise the illegitimate birth-rate at the level of approximately 7 per cent, of all births. With a proportion of 7.38 per cent, for 1950 this would appear to be the case. The infant mortality rate however for illegitimate births was remarkably low and is commented on below. Principal Causes of Death. The death rate for 1950 at 11.59 per thousand population was the lowest ever recorded with the exception of 1948. Owing to changes in the Registrar-General's Classification of Causes of Death, it is not possible for all the 36 causes tabulated to be compared one with another as between 1949 and subsequent years. Malignant neoplasms of lung and bronchus have not previously been shown separately, and neither, for example, has hypertension with heart disease. Motor vehicle accidents have now been separated from other road traffic accidents, the figures being given separately. Infants under one year. The infant mortality rate (29) is slightly higher than the previous year (27) but the variation is small and can again be regarded as indicative of a good standard of infant care and nutrition in general. It is evident that these factors are more important for young infants than are housing conditions or other adverse environmental factors. The illegitimate infant mortality rate at 23 is the lowest figure recorded for this group, but conclusions must be drawn with 8 reserve since the total numbers involved are relatively small. However there can be little doubt that the chance of the illegitimate infant surviving its first year of life is not now substantially different from that of other children. Even with the low infant mortality attained, it is considered that a further reduction is possible. 22 deaths under one year were ascribed to pneumonia and 2 to bronchitis, and many of these must be regarded as preventable. The stillbirth rate of 17.48 was the lowest figure recorded and can be taken in part as a testimony of the extent to which ante-natal care is sought and the efficiency of such care. Deaths from other causes. The number of deaths from respiratory tuberculosis has continued to decrease. The death rate from this cause of 0.38 per thousand population is the lowest recorded figure for Islington. As compared with 1950, the greatest reduction in the number of deaths due to pulmonary tuberculosis occurred in the age-group 15-45 with 30 in 1950 as against 60 in the previous year. There was also a reduction in the age-group 45-65 but some increase (21 to 26) in the age-group 65 and upwards. This confirms the general trend of the extension of life of persons suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, so that the deaths tend to increase in the older age-group. In spite of the reduction of deaths due to this cause in the age-group 15-45, it is still the cause of 30 deaths out of a total of 166, and if 4 other deaths due to other forms of tuberculosis are included, then 20.5 per cent. of all deaths in this group are due to tuberculosis. In the same age-group there were 37 deaths (22.3 per cent.) from all forms of malignant disease and growths, which now exceed for the first time those due to tuberculosis and of these deaths due to malignant disease 38 per cent, were males and 62 per cent, females. In regard to the various types of malignant disease there were 115 male deaths out of a total of 129 due to cancers etc. of the lung and bronchus showing the great masculine preponderance in deaths due to these causes. Motor vehicle accidents accounted for 24 deaths (18 male, 6 female) as against 14 road traffic accidents (all types) in 1949. 9 SECTION B. PREVALENCE AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES.

Although fortunately there were no cases of smallpox in Islington in 1950, information was received from time to time of contacts or possible contacts, particularly in passengers arriving in this country by ships from the Far East on which a case of smallpox may have occurred during the voyage. Such contacts are, of course, kept under observation by the Department's Officers during the period of incubation of the infection. Since Public Health Department staffs are among the first who may have any form of contact with a smallpox case, the necessity of frequent re-vaccination has been stressed to all members of the staff who may be concerned. 10 Successful vaccinations:— 1947 3,345 1st January—3rd July, 1948 1,124 5th July—31st December, 1948 702 1949 1,628 1950 2,307 The Vaccination Acts were rescinded under that National Health Service Act, 1946, as from 5th July, 1948. Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation—Authentication—Ministry of Health Circular 60/48. During the year the Medical Officer of Health dealt with 55 requests for authentication of International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation against smallpox, cholera, typhoid, etc. Measles and Whooping Cough. Measles and Whooping Cough became generally notifiable in London at the end of 1939. Prior to this there was only a limited notification. The following chart shows the measles and whooping cough notifications since 1941, and the table shows fatality rates per 1,000 notifications for each of the groups under 1;1-5; and 5 and upwards and the proportion of notifications in each of the age groups. 11 Fatality Rates per 1,000 notifications each age group Percentage of notifications (1941-1950) (1941-1950) Under 1 1—5 5 & upwards Under 1 1—5 5 & upwards Measles 10.90 0.87 — 6.1 54.7 39.2 Whooping Cough 55.77 5.58 — 13.0 59.8 27.2 The highest fatality rates in both measles and whooping cough are in children under the age of one year. In children under one with whooping cough, approximately one case in 18 is fatal, which is over four times the corresponding rate for measles. 59.8 per cent. of all cases of whooping cough and 54.7 per cent, of all cases of measles occur in children 1-5 years. Although it is still the subject of medical enquiry, whooping cough vaccination is being increasingly requested by parents. London (Measles and Whooping Cough) Regulations, 1938.

Only one death was reported as being due to diphtheria, and this was in a child whose immunisation had been started some time previously but not completed. There was a minor outbreak of diphtheria, an event which is rather unusual since the majority of children in the Borough have been inoculated. In one family, a grandmother, 57 years, mother, 35 years, and two of her children suffered from the same type of diphtheria infection. The mother was very severely ill and the grandmother severely ill, but fortunately all recovered. A third child, a contact of this family, also contracted diphtheria of the same type. Whooping Cough Prophylaxis. Whooping cough is a distressing sickness, especially for young children, and it is therefore natural for parents to seek to protect their children against it. The results are not so assessable as in the case of diphtheria immunisation, nevertheless some modification of the attack, if not complete avoidance, can be expected. Whooping cough immunisation is carried out in the Local Health Authority Clinics and by general practitioners. The Divisional Medical Officer has kindly made available the following information in regard to Islington children:— Whooping Cough Prophylaxis. Total attendances 6,644 Completed cases 2,597 14 Food Poisoning. 104 cases of food poisoning were notified during the year, nearly double the number for the previous year. Again it must be emphasised that the number of cases notified does not represent the total incidence of illness due to food poisoning. It is only exceptionally that food poisoning gives rise to anxiety in an individual affected, and in fact in many instances, possibly the majority, symptoms are slight and of short duration and medical attention is.not sought. The following table is given in accordance with Circular 2/50 of the Ministry of Health. Date No. of Notifications No. of persons served No. of cases reported No. of deaths Foods involved and Organisms responsible 7.6.50 2 200 33 — Ham and Ham sandwiches—Staphylococci. 1.9.50 1 60 16 — Food unknown—Salmonella Typhi Murium. 18.10.50 — 348 169 — Beef contaminated with C1. Welchii. Outbreak 1. Information was received from the Public Health Department of another authority that a number of persons in a motor coach party had been taken ill whilst en route and had been admitted to hospitals in the area of that authority. It was thought that the food most likely to be responsible was ham contained in sandwiches, and enquiries were set on foot immediately at the premises in this Borough where the sandwiches had been prepared. As a result of these enquiries it appeared that the ham had been in store for three or four days and unfortunately the refrigerator in which the food was kept was temporarily out of order. In conjunction with the Central Public Health Laboratory of the Ministry of Health and the Health Department of the area in question, pathological examinations and bacteriological food examinations were carried out. The same organism was recovered from persons affected, from some members of the staff in the catering establishment where the sandwiches were prepared and also on the ham itself, so that there was no doubt that this organism was the cause of food poisoning in this case, and the main cause, as usual, faulty storage conditions for food not consumed very soon after preparation. The greatest assistance was given to this Department by the proprietor and staff in connection with the investigation, and staff found to be carrying the organism remained off duty until found free after repeated bacteriological examinations. Outbreak 2. In this outbreak 16 persons were affected. The organism probably responsible was isolated from patients affected, but unfortunately no food remained over which could be examined. The item of food responsible in this case could therefore not be ascertained. Outbreak 3. Here a considerable number of persons were reported ill (169 out of 348 persons served). The food contaminated was boiled beef. Again the risk was increased by preparation of the food at least a day prior to consumption. Dysentery. Notifications of dysentery during the year increased to 133 from 48 in 1949. In all cases investigated the type of dysentery found was that due to B Sonne, which does not cause severe illness and which usually clears up, with prbper treatment, within a few days or in some instances weeks. The organism, however, may 15 be carried for some time after the initial infection by the convalescent carrier. The great majority of cases in this Borough were treated at home by the family practitioner. It was only in exceptional cases, especially where for one reason or another the bacillus was carried for an unusually long time, that arrangements were made in conjunction with the Regional Hospital Board authorities for the patient to be treated in hospital. Dysentery of this type does not appear to be spread generally through contaminated food, but the mode of spread appears to be one that should rather be dealt with by sanitary and hygienic precautions. The tendency, therefore, is for families to be affected, and also where very young children are grouped together as in day nurseries the most stringent hygienic precautions must be taken if Sonne dysentery is not to be introduced unknowingly into the nursery with the possibility of consequent spread to other children. In view of the desirability of obtaining further information and better notification of food poisoning and dysentery, all medical practitioners in the Borough and medical officers of hospitals were circularised by the Medical Officer of Health, pointing out the obligation of doctors to notify food poisoning under the Food & Drugs Act, 1938, and also pointing out both to doctors and patients who may be suffering from food poisoning that immediate information greatly assists the Department in the task of investigation. In fact, delay in obtaining information may render it impossible to ascertain the circumstances in which the outbreak originated. Scabies and Vermin. Benzyl benzoate continues to be the treatment of choice for Scabies and proprietory 2 per cent. D.D.T. emulsion for the treatment of verminous heads. Both of these preparations have given extremely satisfactory results for their respective purposes. Complicated cases of Scabies and special cases referred by the general practitioners continue to be seen by the Council's consulting dermatologist, Dr. Marre, at the Scabies Clinic, which is held weekly. Treatment for scabies and vermin was carried out at the Public Health Department, Seven Sisters Road (Cleansing Station), as under— Scabies Vermin Children under 5 years Number treated 38 65 Number of baths given 84 — Number of treatments — 68 L.C.C.

The rates per 1.000 population for new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis for the last four years have been—1947—2.18 ; 1948—2.34 ; 1949—2.39 ; 1950—2.07. In recent annual reports I have stressed the concern that must be felt over the increase in the notification rate in spite of a concurrent fall in the pulmonary tuberculosis death rate. It is satisfactory to record therefore that the 1050 notification rate for the first time for several years shows a decrease, but it is not yet possible, of course, to be assured that this decrease will continue. There cannot be any relaxation of our efforts to deal with tuberculosis, and the very difficult and important problems of early detection, early isolation and treatment, the education and if possible provision of separate accommodation for the chronic sputum-positive case often elderly, the attention to housing priority so that tuberculous patients have separate sleeping accommodation, and of course the problems connected with the care and rehabilitation of tuberculosus persons must all be faced. Treatment of tuberculosis, once diagnosed, is long and costly both to the individual and to the community, and whilst the question of cure is of course very important there should be no diversion of attention from the primary importance of prevention. It is also satisfactory to record that the death rate from pulmonary tuberculosis at 0.38 per thousand population is the lowest recorded figure for this Borough. 17 Mass X-Ray. (a) In connection with the campaign for early detection of tuberculosis, if possible before symptoms appear, an invitation was again received from the Mass X-Ray Unit of the North-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board to co-operate with them in arranging for the attendance at this unit of factory and office staffs and residents of the Borough. The unit operated during the summer for approximately three weeks at the West Islington Public Library with the approval of the Council. Information regarding the operation of the unit was circularised to a number of factories in the Borough and poster publicity was also given. (b) The North-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board further invited the co-operation of the Borough Council, and the Public Health Department in particular, in connection with a proposal to establish a static mass radiography unit in the Borough for an experimental period of a year in the first place. It should be possible in this time to examine a substantial section of the population. It is understood that this will be the first static unit of this nature to be tried in London, and the Council gladly indicated their approval and support of this proposal of the Regional Hospital Board.

Although the responsibility for care work has passed under the National Health Service Act, 1948, to the London County Council as the local health authority, the Islington Tuberculosis Care Committee remains in being, working in conjunction with the Islington Chest Clinics at the Royal Northern and Royal Chest Hospitals, and members of the Borough Council and the Medical Officer of Health serve on the Islington Tuberculosis Care Committee and the Divisional Care Committee for the co-ordination of care work in the three Boroughs of Islington, Finsbury and Holborn. Loans of bedding or medical appliances were made to 58 patients others have been referred to various organisations for assistance. I am indebted to Dr. A. B. Stewart, Divisional Medical Officer, London County Council for the 1950 figures in connection with vaccination, diphtheria and whooping cough inoculations, and tuberculosis dispensaries. SECTION C. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE AREA. Owners of some houses in the Borough continued to find that such properties were proving uneconomic, and in certain cases requested the Council to take over the properties, free of charge, and thus relieve them of any future responsibility, but the Council was unable to accept any of these offers. Appropriate action continued to be taken under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, in respect of abatement of statutory nuisances, and the condition of the properties, together with the position in which owners are finding themselves economically, is reflected in the large increase in the number of prosecutions taken by the Council during the year, a number of which were for failure to comply with Abatement Orders. Recourse to legal action has been forced on the Council as a result of circumstances, but it is fully appreciated that the money paid by the owners in penalties would be far better spent on the properties, in assisting them to comply with the Notices at a much earlier stage. The majority of the houses in the Borough are over 70 years old, and this, coupled with the fact that the properties deteriorated considerably during the war, due to lack of repair, makes their maintenance in a reasonable condition difficult. The already acute housing situation did not improve during the year, and rehousing families from unfit houses remains a very slow process. During the year the Minister of Health approved the appointment of a Supervisory Sanitary Inspector, to assist with the supervisory work of the Department. This appointment, although not implemented during the year under review, brought the total establishment of Sanitary Inspectors up to thirty-one, including the Senior and Deputy Senior Sanitary Inspectors, although for seven months of the year full establishment was not attained. 19 The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act came into force on 21st March and repealed the Rats and Mice Destruction Act, 1019. In addition, the Shops Act, 1950, which is a consolidating statute, came into force on 1st October. As far as Islington is concerned, administration remains unaltered. Summary of Work done by District Sanitary Inspectors. During the year 59,958 inspections or revisits were made by the District Sanitary Inspectors.

(dichlor-diphenyl-trichlorethane) as a powder or in solution continued to be used for the purpose of disinfestation of rooms in respect of bugs and other insect pests. The results proved to be very satisfactory, and no reinfestations were reported. The free treatment of rooms and furniture in recommended cases continued, and the number so treated was 303, most of these being on behalf of elderly or infirm persons. A total of 1,590 rooms were disinfested for vermin. During the year, 1,132 rooms were disinfected after cases of infectious or other diseases. The precautionary spraying of furniture and bedding of families removing to new Council dwellings was continued and the effects of 374 families were treated. Cleansing of Verminous Houses. Special consideration was given during the year to a review of the problem of bug disinfestation in houses, taking into account the experience gained by the Department in the use of D.D.T compounds for this purpose since 1947. It was thought that with a more systematic attack on bug infested properties the new insecticides offered a better hope of a major reduction and perhaps ultimate virtual, elimination of the bug nuisance. It was decided in the first place to gain more information in regard to the degree of bug infestation in Islington by carrying out a limited survey in certain areas. Seven streets or blocks of flats were inspected, and although the survey was carried out in April, when evidence of bug infestation is probably lower than in the summer months, it was nevertheless found that from 18—50 per cent. of houses in the different streets inspected showed signs of some infestation. Although the number of streets inspected was limited and perhaps to some degree selected, they can be considered typical of a very large number of streets in Islington. The problem of bug infestation is therefore considerable and serious. Bug disinfestation hitherto has been carried out mainly on premises which have been the subject of complaint or precautionarily in cases of re-housing by the Council. 37 A scheme was approved by the Council for systematic inspection of houses for evidence of bug infestation, in addition to the measures taken above, since it was considered that systematic inspection would permit the more economic use of staff and reduce the probability of re-infestation at a later date by the concurrent treatment of adjoining properties. The inspections were to be carried out under the supervision of the Sanitary Inspector whose principal responsibility is disinfestation work and approval was given to the appointment of two additional disinfestors. The charges made for the disinfestation treatment carried out by the Council were reduced to 7s. 6d. for the first room and 5s. for each additional room in order to encourage acceptance of the Council's service. It was not found possible to commence the block disinfestation scheme during the current year, but preparations were made for its commencement in the Spring of 1951. Steam disinfection. 224,300 articles of clothing or bedding were subjected to steam disinfection at the Disinfecting Station (216,398 for clothing contractors). In addition, 55 tons, 18 cwt. 2 qtrs. of material was disinfected for clothing contractors. Public Health (London) Act, 1936—Emission of Smoke. For the year under review, the Council appointed two representatives to serve on the London and Home Counties Smoke Abatement Advisory Council. Difficulty continued to be experienced in the enforcement of Part V. of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, consequent upon the control of fuel. Factory proprietors and staff co-operated as much as possible, and therefore smoke nuisances were kept to a minimum during the year. In this connection, thanks are also due to the Ministry of Fuel and Power for its active co-operation. The Ministry has continued to afford every facility in its power to assist the Council in the problems of smoke abatement.

Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. During the year under review the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, came into force. This Act revoked the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919. The new Act makes it obligatory upon the occupier of any land to give the local authority Notice forthwith in writing if it comes to his knowledge that rats or mice are living on or resorting to land in substantial numbers. The Act has clarified the procedure and Notices can now be served on the occupier or the owner of the land to keep the land free from rats and mice and any such Notice may require:— 41 (a) the application of any form of specified treatment ; (b) the carrying out of any structural repairs or other specified works and in addition the Notice may prescribe the times at which any treatment required by the Notice is to be carried out. The Council is now authorised to take such steps as they consider necessary or expedient for the purpose of destroying rats or mice entering premises which are in the occupation of different persons without serving Notices on the occupiers or owners of the premises. Part II of the Act provides similar provisions in respect of Food undertakings but in such cases where such premises are infested, Notice may be sent to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries who is authorised to take the necessary action. Action under the Act may be taken in respect of rats, mice, insects or mites in numbers or under conditions which involve an immediate or potential risk or substantial loss of or damage to food. Details of the work performed by the Rodent Control Section are given as follows:— Number of complaints received 1,894 Number of investigations carried out 5,153 Number of infestations found were 2,062 (Comprising 216 business premises, 2 Local Authority premises and 1,844 Dwellings). Number of smoke tests carried out were 130 Treatments carried out were:- Dwellings 1,844 with 12,229 baits being laid Local Authority premises 2 with 14 baits being laid Business premises 104 with 936 baits being laid Post bait treatments in respect of dwellings and business premises 1,098 with 10,720 baits being laid 3,048 23,899 The number of agreements sent out 125 The number of agreements returned 104 Percentage of Ship Rats : ½ per cent. of complaints received. A number of business premises continue to be dealt with by the occupiers' own staff or servicing firms. Where this procedure is adopted the premises are kept under supervision to ensure that the treatment is satisfactory. The work carried out by this Section of the Department demands patience and in order to bring cases to a satisfactory conclusion it is sometimes necessary for investigations to be made over considerable periods. Damage due to enemy action does not assist these duties for it is often difficult to trace the origin of an infestation due to a defective, disused or unsealed drain. In one case where a house was continually troubled with rats it was only after excavations had been made by the Council after prolonged and difficult investigations that a defective drain was found belonging to another property but which resulted in rats finding their way into the premises in question. In another case after extensive drain tests were carried out with the assistance of the L.C.C., a defective brick barrel drain was found to exist under the property a few houses away from where the complaints were received. 42 In another case it was necessary for 103 visits to be paid, 30 pre-baiting and poisoning treatments to be carried out and for the drains to be subjected to three smoke tests, before the premises were finally cleared of rats. In a new estate in the Borough complaints were received that one particular house was troubled with rats and, upon examination, it was found that an unsealed drain had been left for the purpose of taking away the drainage of a proposed garage. Upon sealing this inlet the nuisance was abated. It was necessary to poison bait on a vacant site in the Borough and in order to avoid any possible danger, the site was suitably fenced and the surrounding tenants were informed of the intention to lay poison so that children and pets could be kept under control. This necessitated the sending of 240 Notices and the treatment was successfully carried out. Sewer Treatments. Treatments in respect of the Council's Sewers were carried out on three occasions, one of which was a special treatment carried out in conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. 5th June to 15th June, 1950.

The portion treated was between Richmond Avenue, Liverpool Road, Theberton Street (Upper Street) and the Angel and the sewers were subjected to three individual treatments. The first was a direct poison treatment using damp sausage rusk and 1 per cent. Sodium Fluoroacetate. The second treatment consisted of two days pre-baiting with Bread Mash followed by a poison baiting with Bread Mash and 10 per cent. Arsenious Oxide. On a third occasion the treatment comprised the use of a Barley Mash with 2 per cent. Antu added to form the poison bait. Two days pre-baiting was followed by poisoning on the third day. Having regard to the fact that the part of the Finsbury system proved to be lightly infested, only the first two treatments were carried out on this section. Although the series of treatments resulted in a considerable reduction in the number of rats, the efficiency of the series 43 could not be fully ascertained until the June routine treatment. The standard treatment in June of this year showed a considerable decrease in the rat population in the sewers situate in this particular area. Water Supplies. Main water supplies for premises in the Borough are the responsibility of the Metropolitan Water Board. Samples were taken for chemical and bacteriological examination, four of which were reported as unsatisfactory. This was due to dirty storage conditions at the premises and in each case remedial action was taken which resulted in the storage facilities being brought up to the required standard. Thanks are due to the Metropolitan Water Board for its co-operation and wholehearted assistance during the year. Details of cases where a waste of water comes to the notice of this Department are forwarded immediately to the Board and the necessary action taken. The number of bore-holes and wells known to exist in the Borough is 28. 18 of these have been abandoned and effectively sealed, leaving 10 capable of being used. 4 of which are temporarily out of commission. Samples of water for chemical and bacteriological examinations have been taken from the 6 at present in use and the results showed that no exceptions can be taken to their use for domestic or washing purposes. In no case is the water used for dietetic purposes and the position in respect of underground water in the Borough is therefore satisfactory. In accordance with the requirements of Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, 25 applications for water certificates were received and 25 certilicates were issued in respect of 532 dwellings and one Laundry. The following samples were taken:— Mains Supply. Chemical Bacteriological Satisfactory U nsatisfactory Chemical Bacteriological Chemical Bacteriological 11 11 7 7 4 4 Well Water. Chemical Bacteriological Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Chemical Bacteriological Chemical Bacteriological 6 6 6 6 - - Swimming Bath Water. Chemical Bacteriological Satisfactory U nsatisfactorv Chemical Bacteriological Chemical Bacteriological 7 7 7 7 - - Requisitioned Property. Requisitioned property continued to be supervised in order to ensure that wherever practicable the statutory requirements were complied with. Archway Group Hospital Management Committee. The Public Health Department, at the request of the Committee, have carried out inspections in the Islington Hospitals of the Group and have advised the Committee in regard to various matters of sanitation, and also in connection with rodent and insect infestation. At the request of the Committee, regular quarterly inspections by the staff of the Public Health Department have now been arranged, and disinfestation work as necessary will also be carried out through the Department. 44 SECTION D. HOUSING. The houses in the Borough continue in the main to deteriorate due to their age and the cessation of major repairs as a result of war time conditions. Although it has not so far been practicable under post-war conditions to resume slum clearance, consideration has been given during the year to the possibility of resumption in the near future, in conjunction with the London County Council. Some preliminary survey work has been undertaken and it can be said at this stage that the requirements in Islington in regard to slum clearance are both major and pressing. Another aspect of the housing problem which probably affects Islington more than most other London Boroughs, in view of the close concentration of multi-storey Victorian housing, is the high proportion and large total number of underground rooms. It has not been possible to carry out systematic inspection of underground rooms but there is no doubt that a very considerable number do not comply with the Underground Room Regulations, and in view of the nature of the houses it would probably be uneconomic to attempt on a large scale to make these rooms comply. Some houses are also falling into disrepair by reason of the owners finding the property uneconomic and in some instances abandoning ownership. The twin problems therefore of the maintenance in habitable condition existing housing and the re-housing of the people in new housing must constitute sources of anxiety for many years to come. The number of new applications (L.C.C.) referred to this Department 2,957 The number of above families living in overcrowded conditions 883 The number of above families not living in overcrowded conditions 667 The number of families re-housed by the L.C.C. 380 The number of families re-housed by the Islington Borough Council 310 The total number of letters sent concerning housing conditions 3,441 The number of flats erected by this Council 390 The number of flats in the course of erection 400 During the year the following action was taken under the Housing Act, 1930:— Section Number of Dwellings represented 9 3 11 (unfit houses) 16 12 (parts of buildings) 3 12 (underground rooms) 32 Total 54 45 Resulting from these and previous representations and like proceedings during the year the following action was taken :— Section Action Number of Dwellings 11 Demolition orders 10 11 Undertakings accepted 5 12 Closing orders made 13 (25 underground rooms) 12 Undertakings accepted 8 (This figure includes 15 basement rooms and 3 other rooms). 12 Closing order made 1 (Part of dwelling) Total 37 Undertaking cancelled upon completion of the necessary work 1 Number of dwellings erected by the Council during the year 390 Licences Authorising Temporary Overcrowding. Eight licences were granted under Section 61 of the Housing Act, 1936, authorising overcrowding for a period of six months. In three cases these constituted renewals of licences which had expired, and the total number of dwellings affected was, therefore, five. SECTION E—SUPERVISION OF FOOD. It will be seen by reference to the detailed list of prosecutions under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, that there was an increase in the number of prosecutions taken during the year under review and in certain cases substantial fines and costs were collected. In one case a quantity amounting to about 10 grains of commercial red lead was found in a loaf of bread. Other cases were taken against butchers etc., for selling horse flesh for human consumption contrary to requirements of Section 3 and 38 respectively of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. As reported in my previous Annual Report the Council continued to provide free of charge washing facilities in public conveniences in order to encourage greater cleanliness amongst Food handlers, particularly Street Traders, who have no convenient personal facilities. The following table which has been provided by the courtesy of the Cleansing Superintendent gives details of the weekly average number of persons who availed themselves of the Council's facilities :— The following table which has been provided by the courtesy of the Cleansing Superintendent gives details of the weekly average number of persons who availed themselves of the Council's facilities:— 46 Lavatory Jan.

The Inspectors found that the general conditions of these stalls continued to be satisfactory. Food and Drugs Act, 1938.—Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949. Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887 to 1926. Sampling of Food, including Milk.—Prosecutions.

Defendant fined £20. Council awarded £10 10s. costs. North London 48 The Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, which came into operation on the 1st October, revoked the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1926 to 1943, and it will be noted by reference to the prosecution details that costs were awarded against the Council upon a case being taken under the new Regulations. This was due to the fact that the Counsel for the Defence submitted that Regulation 26(1) required the prosecution to prove that immediately before being filled, the bottle was not in a state of thorough cleanliness. This submission was accepted by the Magistrate. It will be appreciated therefore that it is of course almost impossible to prove this, as in the nature of things neither officers of the Council nor any persons unconnected with the Dairy can see the bottles being filled. Attention is drawn to the interesting case under the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887, where, upon complaint, samples were obtained of tinned smoked Saithe exposed for sale as Smoked Salmon. At the hearing the Magistrate took a serious view of this offence and inflicted a substantial fine and costs. This case is connected with one taken under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, details of which will be found in the schedule of prosecutions under that statute. Unsound Food. The total amount of food condemned during the year was :— 23 tons, 16 cwt. 11 lbs. 4 ozs. details of which are given in the following table :— Tons Cwts. Qtrs. Stones Lbs. Ozs. Tinned Goods 16 14 - 1 3 4 Fish — 15 1 1 9 — Fruit — 10 1 1 4 - Meat — 14 - — 9 — Others 5 2 — — - — Total 23 16 - - 11 4 Number of condemnation certificates issued was 1,206. # All the above food, with the exception of 1 cwt. 26 lbs. were condemned upon request by the respective owners. Sampling. 1,007 samples (385 formal, 622 informal) were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination. Of these 33 (or 3.28 per cent.) were adulterated as shown in the following summary :— FormaI Informal Milk '2 Milk 3 Smoked Salmon 1 Vermouth 1 Special Blood Elixir 1 Hangover Cure 1 Beef 1 Brown Ale 1 Hangover Cure 1 Groats 1 49 Informal Bread 2 Tinctures of Iodine 4 Palm Kernel oil 1 Sultana Pudding and Custard 1 Bun Roll 1 Blood Elixir 1 Tea Seed Oil 1 Potted Meat 1 Meat 1 Port Style Wine 1 Chewing Gum 1 Beef Sausages 1 Sheeps Head 1 Digestive Mints 1 Sodiment in Milk Bottle 1 Cough Mixture 1 6 27 Of the formal samples taken, two milk samples were found to be adulterated, being slightly deficient in non-fatty solids ; the smoked salmon was found to be fish other than smoked salmon ; the blood elixir was incorrectly labelled ; the beef was reported to be horse flesh and the Hangover Cure was not labelled with the ingredients. Meat and Other Foods. The owners of four private slaughter houses renewed their licences. None of these premises however, was used during the year owing to the Government's scheme of centralised slaughtering. The Metropolitan Cattle Market, which is under the control of the Ministry of Food, was visited on 12 occasions by the Meat and Food Inspector for the purpose of inspecting imported and other meat. One slaughter house for horses was licensed. The Report of the Manufactured Meat Products Working Party was issued during the year, and it is hoped that new legislation will be made in the very near future, which will enable the recommendation of the Working Party to be adequately enforced. Slaughtermen's Licences. 23 Licences were granted. 1 new licence issued during the year. Bye-Laws for the Protection of Food. No prosecutions were taken during the period under review. 50 Registered Artificial Cream Premises. (At present dealing in Synthetic Cream). Number of visits—1. ICE CREAM. Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations, 1947. Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Amendment Regulations, 1948. Supervision of the Manufacture of Ice Cream. Ice cream is a food which is now commonly manufactured and sold throughout the year, although naturally the summer sale is greater than the winter sale. Certain examinations are customarily carried out which give some indication of the probable bacteriological risks of the ice cream, but unfortunately it has not so far been found practicable to propose statutory standards of bacteriological purity, and the examinations done carry no statutory authority. It will be noted from the report to follow that 92 premises in Islington are registered under the Food & Drugs Act, 1938, for the manufacture/sale/storage of ice cream. Some of these manufacturers make considerable quantities and sell only through distributors or to retail concerns. Ice cream, therefore, contaminated at the manufacturing end might in the case of a large firm have a widespread distribution and sampling might be done and an unsatisfactory result first obtained in the area of the local authority where the retail sale took place and not in the area of manufacture. In the manufacture of ice cream on a large scale, highly specialised and expensive machinery and equipment is essential. The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations, 1947, require that subject to certain qualifications the ingredients of ice cream shall be heat treated after being mixed, and that the mixture shall then be cooled until the freezing process is begun. The heat treatment requirements are very specific, and the effect is similar to that produced by the pasteurisation of milk. However, bacteria might be introduced after heat treatment, and if this is the case then the final product would be bacteriologically contaminated. It is not always obvious where contamination occurs, particularly where the equipment is up-to-date, the premises appear very suitable and the handling of the material appears to be reasonably careful. In one instance where it was necessary to investigate the ice cream production of a firm manufacturing large quantities, these requirements were fulfilled and yet unsatisfactory samples were obtained. Investigations were carried out with the full co-operation of the management and staff of the firm concerned, and bacteriological examinations were carried out by the Central Public Health Laboratory. It was found necessary to sample the mixture at 15 different stages of manufacture, from the initial mixing to the final product in the carton. Members of the staff also agreed to have their hands swabbed for detection of any organisms which might have been found in the ice cream. As a result of these examinations, it was found that there was a limited degree of contamination in a holder known as the " ageing vat " in which the ice cream is held for a time while cooling and prior to its being pumped through to be made into ice cream blocks or filled into cartons. It is a difficult task to cleanse thoroughly all machinery in a large plant such as this. After manufacture all holders, pipes, connections, etc. must be dismantled and washed or rinsed through with disinfectant solutions, after being cleansed. In this 51 factory, the ice cream is not handled from the time the mixture is originally made until it is filled into cartons. Nevertheless, the personal factor is important even in such a plant by reason of the necessary cleansing of the machinery which must be carried out. Choc-ices are slightly more liable to contamination than block ices or ice cream in cartons, since it does not appear to be practicable at present to make this product without a certain amount of handling. The final outcome of this particular investigation, typical of others, was that with a little more thought in connection with the cleansing process of the equipment, a product was ultimately obtained of a satisfactory standard. During the year 922 visits were paid to ice cream premises. The number of premises registered :— (a) For the manufacture/sale/storage 92 (b) For sale and storage 146 (c) For sale only 231 (d) For storage only 5 474 Bacteriological Examination. 289 samples of ice cream were sent for bacteriological examination. The gradings of those submitted to the Methylene Blue Test were reported to be as follows :— Grade I 91 Grade II 87 Grade III 63 Grade IV 46 287 Samples graded in 1 and 11 of the Methylene Blue Test are considered satisfactory but samples graded in III and IV unsatisfactory. The remaining two samples were satisfactory. In addition 34 samples of Ice Lollies were examined bacteriologically, one of which was reported to be unsatisfactory. / Chemical Examination. 54 samples of Ice Cream were submitted for chemical analysis, none of which was reported to be unsatisfactory. The fat contents of these samples were as follows :— Fat Content Less Than— 3% 4% 5% 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% 12% 13% 4 4 4 5 4 1 5 13 6 5 3 18 Ice Lolly samples were also submitted for chemical analysis and no objection could be taken to the results obtained. 52 Milk Samples. The total number of samples taken during 1950 was 823.

During the year there was no outbreak of foot and mouth disease which brought this Borough within the infected area and there was no action necessary to be taken by this Council under these Statutes. SECTION F- MISCELLANEOUS SERVICES. Health Publicity. Apart from the continuous health publicity carried out by the staff of the Department during the normal course of their work, particularly the outdoor staff, the regular publicity was continued through posters, leaflet distribution, and the exhibition of films. Six public film shows were organised in different parts of the Borough. On each occasion films connected with some form of health propaganda were shown, and this was combined with a brief address by the Medical Officer of Health. During the year there was also held at the Town Hall an Islington Industries Exhibition organised as part of the Silver Jubilee Celebrations in conjunction with the Chamber of Commerce. The Public Health Department was invited to take a stand, and exhibits on the stand were arranged in conjunction with— Liaison Officer, Mass Radiography Unit. Public Analyst. Smoke Abatement Society. Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene. Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries—Infestation Division. The Department was asked by the Central Office of Information to assist with publicity for an all-day showing of films including films on health and food hygiene, and an invitation was sent to nearly 2,000 firms and shops in the Borough. Some general health talks were also given by the Medical Officer of Health to local organisations. Aged and Infirm Persons. I reported last year on the increasing number of elderly infirm or sick persons referred to the Public Health Department for assistance in dealing with the various problems either in relation to Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, or for assistance in obtaining hospital admission. Every case presents a different kind of problem, but in many instances general practitioners ask if some assistance can be given since the patients—elderly persons suffering from some degree of chronic 54 sickness—cannot be properly cared for at home and cannot be admitted to hospital without a prolonged period of waiting. One typical case was that of an elderly lady who was alone in the house during the day except for an occasional call by a neighbour. There appeared to be no person available to prepare food or to wash her or attend to her physical needs, and when seen she had probably had very little in the way of nourishment for several days, nor had she washed or been washed for a considerable time. She was not on any doctor's list, although an emergency call had been made to a doctor. The London Executive Council were immediately informed and given the appropriate particulars regarding assignment to a doctor, and eventually it was found possible to obtain admission for her to a hospital. Unfortunately she died two days after admission, but it was only by a happy accident that she had not been left to die unattended at home. The removal of the obligation upon a public hospital to accept a case through the Assistance Officer after the passing of the National Assistance Act has created a situation where the problem of home care and supervision of elderly persons, including the provision of a regular meals service, is becoming increasingly important and necessary. Meals on Wheels Service. During the year the Council approved a scheme for the supply of hot mid-day meals to old people, particularly those old persons who had difficulty in leaving their homes to get a meal or to make their own purchases. The selection of persons to be supplied will be made on the basis of a recommendation by the Medical Officer of Health, after enquiry, it is intended that information regarding persons who should be considered for Meals on Wheels service assistance will be gathered from medical practitioners, district nurses, Family Welfare Association workers, National Assistance Board officers, local health authority departments and voluntary organisations. The recommendations will then be forwarded to the Hon. Organiser of the Women's Voluntary Services, who has been made responsible by the Council for the running of the service, with the assistance of a Council grant under Section 31 of the National Assistance Act. Cleansing of Old Persons. Further consideration was also given to the problem of elderly persons who have become generally careless in regard to their personal habits and state of cleanliness and are in need of personal disinfestation. Such persons, apart from being verminous, usually wear neglected and filthy clothing, and the bedding is also frequently found to be in a deplorable condition whether it is verminous or not. The home is generally neglected, and even after cleansing these persons often continue to wear dilapidated and dirty underclothing, and return to a home where the bedding is unclean, worn or verminous. Having regard to these facts, and since the greater proportion of such persons are in receipt of old age pensions or national assistance benefit, arrangements were made, in conjunction with the Family Welfare Association and National Assistance Board, that where elderly persons who are physically feeble and confined to their homes were treated at the Cleansing Station, arrangements would be made to provide underclothing to be delivered at the Station at the same time as the cleansing was being done and for the dirty and worn bedding to be replaced. The person 55 concerned would then he able to discard existing clothing and bedding and be provided with clean new underwear and suitable bedding immediately after receiving cleansing treatment. Public Mortuary. By agreement with the St. Pancras Borough Council the use of the Council's Mortuary was discontinued as and from 31st March, 1949, all bodies being received at the St. Pancras Mortuary, Camley Street, N.W.1, after that date. Islington Crematorium. There were 224 cremations during the year at the Council's Crematorium, East Finchley, all of which were certified by the Medical Referee or Deputy Medical Referee.
