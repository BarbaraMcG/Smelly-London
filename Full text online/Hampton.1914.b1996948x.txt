HAMPT 14 Hampton Urban District Council. Annual Report of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH For the Year 1914. Hampton Urban District Council. MEDICAL OFFICER'S ANNUAL REPORT. Hampton, Middlesex, 31st May, 1915. Gentlemen, I beg to present my report as Medical Officer of Health, for the year ended 31st December, 1914. PHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE DISTRICT. The district covers an area of 2,044 acres, including 62 acres which are covered with water; and is bounded on the west by Sunbury; on the north by Hanworth; on the east by Teddington and Hampton Wick; and the River Thames flows along the whole of the southern boundary. The district lies on a gravel subsoil of considerable depth, and stands at a height of from 55 to 65 feet above ordnance datum, or roughly from 35 to 45 feet above the ordinary summer water level of the River Thames. The major portion of the western area of the district is under cultivation—mainly for flower and fruit culture—and the principal occupations of the working class section of the population are outdoor ones. The district is well provided in the matter of open spaces, a considerable portion of Bushy Park and the whole of Hampton Court Green being within the district. In addition to the above, the Terrace Gardens on the river bank, the grounds at the Public Offices and the recreation ground at Hampton Hill are under the control of the 4 Council; and to all of these open spaces the public have free access, subject to the usual regulations. VITAL STATISTICS. The table (No. 1) which is printed with this report gives the birth, death, and infantile mortality rates for 1914 and the previous five years. I estimate that the population of the district at midsummer 1914 was 10,000 and the following tables are based on this estimate. BIRTHS AND BIRTH RATE. The total number of births registered during the year was 183—97 males and 86 females—two of whom were illegitimate. This in equal to a rate of 18.3 per thousand of the estimated population, a slight decline oil the rate for the previous year, and a decrease of 3 per 1000 on the average for the previous five years. DEATHS AND DEATH RATE. Eighty-two deaths were registered within the district, three of which were of non-residents; and the Registrar General has furnished particulars respecting twenty-eight residents whose deaths occurred outside the district. Of these residents dying outside the district, ten deaths occurred at the Union Infirmary at Kingston; four in London Hospitals; one in the County Asylum; two at Teddington Cottage Hospital; one in Molesey Cottage Hospital, and ten at other places outside the district. After correcting these figures, the total number of deaths of persons belonging to the district is 107, equal to a rate of 5 10'7 of the estimated population, which is a slight reduction of the rate of 11.1 recorded in the previous year. The County Medical Officer of Health mentions in his last annual report that the factor for age and sex distribution for this district is 9699, which makes the corrected death rate 10'3 per thousand. Particulars respecting the causes of death, together with the age periods at death, will be found in Table III. attached to this report. Below will be found a table showing the distribution of these death between males and females, and the age periods at death. DEATHS OP RESIDENTS, 1914. Sex. At all ages. Under 1 year. 1 to 2 2 to 5 5 to 15 15 to 25 25 to 45 45 to 65 65 and upwards. Males 45 8 0 1 1 0 3 9 23 Females 62 11 2 0 4 0 3 15 27 Totals 107 19 2 1 5 0 6 24 50 Of the 107 deaths recorded, nineteen occurred among infants under one year of age, and fifty-seven among persons aged 60 years and upwards. Of these latter 18 were between 60 and 70: 21 between 70 and 80: 16 between 80 and 90, and 2 were 90 years and over. There were twelve inquests during the year, nine within the district and three outside; and the verdicts recorded were as follows Natural causes, 4; found drowned, 1; accidents, 5; suicides, 2. 6 There were six deaths from the principal zymotic diseases during the year, viz.:—Diarrhoea, 4; whooping cough, 1; diphtheria, 1 ; equal to a rate of 0.6 per thousand. The death from diphtheria occurred in a London Hospital, and the illness was not notified in this district. INFANTILE MORTALITY. Nineteen infants died before reaching the age of one year, of whom three did not survive a week after birth. The causes of these infants' deaths were as follows:— Pneumonia. 1; premature birth, 4; whooping cough, 1; tuberculous meningitis, 1; erysipelas, 1; bronchitis, 1; diarrhoea and enteritis, 4; congenital malformation, 1; debility, 4 ; other diseases, 1. The infantile mortality rate for the year is 103'8 per thousand births and is a decided increase on the rate of 76.9 per 1000 births for 1913. Practically half of these deaths were due to pre-natal causes: prematurity accounting for four, and congenital defects and debility being the cause of five other deaths. In Table IV. will be found the full list of the causes of death of these infants, and the age periods at death. PREVENTION OF INFANTILE MORTALITY. I have recommended your Council to adopt the Notification of Births Act, 1907, but the matter is deferred for the present. Under the provisions of the Infant Life Protection Act, the Board of Guardians employ a trained nurse to make periodical inspections of those children residing within the district to which the Act applies. 7 Midwives' Act, 1902. The supervision of the midwives practising in the district is carried out under the direction of the County Medical Officer of Health. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. In Table II will be found a summary of the notifications received during the year under the provisions of the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Acts and the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations. There have been no cases of small-pox, enteric fever or puerperal fever. Scarlet Fever. Forty-six cases were notified: of these forty-two were treated in the Council's Isolation Hospital and one at a London Hospital; the latter case occurring while the patient was in hospital for an operation. Of the forty-six cases, twenty-two occurred in Hampton and twenty-four in Hampton Hill. It is interesting to note that twenty-two of these cases occurred in seven houses. A small outbreak occurred during September and October, twenty cases being notified in the two months, mainly among scholars attending the Hampton Hill Schools. I visited the school during the outbreak and with the County Medical Officer made an inspection of the children with a view to the discovery of any missed cases. Prompt measures were taken to prevent the spread of infection and the class room in which the majority of the cases occurred was disinfected. 8 At the time these cases were occurring, the girls were very busy knitting socks for our soldiers, and it was quite possible that infection might have been carried in the material used. There were no deaths from this disease. Diphtheria. Only two cases occurred in the district, one of which was a mild one and was treated at home. The other was a military patient in billet at Hampton Court and was removed to the Isolation Hospital. As there were about 240 men in this billet, special steps were taken to prevent the spread of the disease among the men and no further cases occurred. Erysipelas. Ten cases were notified, one of which a patient under one year of age, terminated fatally. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. In the early part of the year an order was made by the Local Government Board requiring the notification of this disease, the order coming into force on April 1st. Six cases were notified, three by Medical Practitioners and three by Midwives. In eacli case notified by a midwife, I visited the premises and gave advice respecting the treatment of the patient. Poliomyelitis. One case was notified, that of a child two years of age, who was treated as an out-patient of a London Hospital. 9 Tuberculosis. Since February 1st, 1913, all forms of Tuberculosis Lave been compulsorily notifiable. Twenty-two cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and four cases of other forms of the disease were notified. Nine of the pulmonary cases were treated at various sanatoria, and one other patient was a visitor who only stayed in the district for a short period Of those patients treated at sanatoria, five resumed their ordinary occupations after discharge. There have been four deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis, and, of the other cases notified during the year, two proved fatal, one from meningitis and the other from abdominal tuberculosis. Tuberculosis Dispensary (Middlesex County Council). A branch dispensary has been opened at Twickenham during the year. The chief dispensary for the district is at Hounslow, where the Tuberculosis Medical Officer has a few beds at his disposal for more severe cases. The domiciliary treatment of these patients is chiefly carried out by the doctors working under the National Insurance Act. One of the portable open air shelters provided by the Council is still in constant use. Premises occupied by patients are inspected and advice is given respecting the measures necessary to prevent the spread of the disease, and the rooms and clothing are disinfected on the removal or death of the patient. 10 Cancer. Five deaths were registered during the year, being a decrease of one as compared with last year, and seven less than in 1912. The Council has undertaken to disinfect the bedding and the rooms occupied by persons suffering from this disease, when a request is made by the medical practitioner in attendance. Venereal Diseases. As far as can be ascertained there is no marked prevalence of these diseases in this district. No local facilities for modern methods of treatment exist, cases being mostly treated in the London Hospitals. Bacteriological Work. The Council has an arrangement with the Clinical Research Association for this work, and pays the cost of the necessary examinations in suspected cases of Diphtheria and Tuberculosis. Under this arrangement nine swabs and ten specimens of sputum were examined and reported upon during 1914. Disinfection. All rooms are disinfected after the occurrence of infectious disease by means of Formalin Gas and the rooms are stripped and cleansed when necessary. Bedding and clothing is disinfected by steam at the Isolation Hospital. This work is done in all cases by the Council's Officers free of cost to the householder. 11 Eighty-seven rooms have been disinfected by the Inspector of Nuisances, and 514 articles have been disinfected by steam or destroyed. Forty-three rooms have been stripped and cleansed. Isolation Hospital. This building is situate in the Uxbridge Road, Hampton Hill, and comprises a hospital block containing four wards (two for Scarlet Fever and two for Diphtheria) with a covered verandah running tlie whole length of the building on the south side and with the necessary lavatory accommodation, bath rooms and ward kitchens, and an administration block in which are the quarters for the matron, nurse, and female staff. In a detached building is the laundry and disinfecting rooms in which is installed a steam disinfecting apparatus. There is also a porter's lodge, attached to which are the discharging wauls; and at the boundary of the grounds is the coach house and mortuary. An ambulance with two beds is provided for the removal of patients. The hospital site is nearly seven acres in extent, of which about two and three quarters are used, the remainder being let for horticultural purposes. The hospital is connected to the residence of the Medical Superintendent, the Council Offices, Police, and Fire Brigade by telephone. The arrangement made by the Council with the Uxbridge Joint Hospital Board for the reception into their hospital at Yeading of cases of small-pox from this district is still in force. 12 Schools. There are four public elementary schools and one secondary school in the district, and these premises are kept under constant observation. Some minor defects discovered during inspection were promptly remedied. The medical inspection of the children attending the public elementary schools is conducted by officers appointed by the County Education Committee; the County Medical Officer of Health being the Chief School Medical Officer. With a view to preventing the spread of infectious disease among the scholars attending these schools, a system of notification is in use; under which the head teacher is informed of the occurence of any case among the children, and a notice excluding all contacts of school age is also sent to the head teacher of the school attended by these contacts. The County Medical Officer is also notified at the same time. A further notice is also sent to the teacher on the discharge of a scholar from the Isolation Hospital. The head teachers also notify me of any cases of nonnotifiable infectious disease which occur in their respective schools ; and the following notifications were received during the year:— Measles, 3; German measles, 2; mumps, 1; chickenpox, 23; whooping cough, 37; ringworm, 4; a total of 70 cases. Dwelling Houses. The dwellings erected by the Council a few years ago under the provisions of the Housing of the Working Classes 13 Act have been fully occupied, and are kept in repair by the Council's own staff under the supervision of the Surveyor. Thirty-seven houses have been inspected under the provisions of the Housing and Town Planning Act, but I have not found it necessary to make any representations to the Council. Two of these were in a filthy condition, and were at once cleansed by the owners. In addition to the above a large number of houses have been inspected, and nuisances arising from defects in the buildings, defective roofs, gutters and rain pipes; defective and choked drains, dirty rooms, defective or dirty closets, refuse, &c. have been remedied; particulars of which will be found in the report of the Inspector of Nuisances. The question of house accommodation for the working classes was carefully investigated during the year; and it was found that about twenty houses were vacant; the rents of these varying from 4/6 to 8/6 per week, inclusive. Two cases of overcrowding were reported and were promptly abated. Milk Supply. The milk produced in the district is insufficient for the needs of the inhabitants, and a large quantity is imported by rail and from neighbouring districts. There are three cowkeepers in the district, who keep an average number of 100 milch cows which are grazed during the greater portion of the year; but this number is being lowered, as one farmer is reducing his herrl considerably. The cattle are inspected quarterly by the Council's Veterinary Surgeon for the purpose of detecting any case of 14 tubercular disease of the udder that might exist, and his reports have been consistently satisfactory. Under the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts, the Board of Agriculture made an Order in 1913; providing for the compulsory notification by cowkeepers of any case of tubercular disease among their cattle. I, and the Inspector, have made periodical inspections of all the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops in the district, and found the premises were kept in a cleanly condition. Regulations under the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order are in force. There are three cowkeepers, five dairymen and eight purveyors of milk on the register. To prevent the spread of infectious disease by means of milk cans, dairymen are immediately informed by the Inspector of Nuisances of the occurrence of disease among their customers: and advised to refrain from leaving cans at the house for a specified period. Food Supply. There are nine retail bakehouses in the district one of which is not in use; and none of the bakehouses are underground ones. The bakehouses, slaughter-houses (5 in number), butchers' and fishmongers' shops have been inspected at intervals by myself and the Inspector of Nuisances and were found to be kept in a satisfactory condition. The Inspector of Nuisances holds the certificate of the Royal Sanitary Institute as an Inspector of meat and other foods, and is frequently in attendance at the local slaughterhouses during the process of slaughtering. 15 The cattle and smaller animals killed locally are of good quality, and no case of tuberculosis was found to exist. Two livers and some mackerel were found to be unfit for food, and were seized and destroyed. The work of sampling articles of food, &c. under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts is carried out by the officers of the County Council. Offensive Trades. The only business coming under this heading is the Soap Works situated in Thames Street. I have inspected the premises and found them kept in a clean condition ; all waste material being frequently removed. A nuisance was caused by the odours arising during the melting of the tallow; and was promptly abated on the owner's attention being called to the matter. Water Supply. The whole of the district is supplied on the constant service system from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. The supply has been maintained at good pressure, and the water is clear, bright and well filtered. Several of the Water Board's pumping stations are within the district, and a nuisance was created in the latter part of the year by the discharge of black smoke from the chimney shafts at these works. It was reported to be due to the Board's inability to obtain their proper supply of steam coal from the colleries. Representations were made to the resident engineer and the discharges were minimised as far as possible, 16 Factory and Workshop Acts, 1901 and 1907. There were 47 premises on the register on January 1st, of these eight have been closed or the use of the premises as workshops has been discontinued and one has been converted into a factory by the installation of electricpl power. Three new workshops have been added, leaving 41 premises on the register at the close of the year. These include dressmakers, tailors, bootmakers, laundries, smiths, retail bakehouses, cycle makers, and other trades where hand labour is employed. One hundred and eighty-two inspections have been made to these premises, seven workshops have been cleansed and whitewashed, five bakehouses were limewashed; three defective sanitary conveniences have been amended and three other nuisances were abated. Outworkers' lists have been received from employers giving out home work (in each case the making of clothing) and the names and addresses of' the outworkers were forwarded to the Local Authorities n whose districts they resided. One outworkers' list was received and the premises were inspected. It has not been found necessary to notify H.M. Inspector of any contravention of the Acts. Military in the District. Early in September the 8th (reserve) Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment—about 1000 strong—were billetted in the district at Hampton Court. 17 The cavalry barracks was used, and in addition, the Whitehall Hotel and two large unoccupied houses were used for billetting the men. The Council's officers supervised the renovation of the existing sanitary conveniences and the provision of extra urinal and latrine accommodation, and, as one of these houses had been empty for about nine years, a very considerable amount of work was necessary to put the fittings into proper working order. The premises occupied were supplied with water from the public service. The cooking for the troops billeted in these houses was done in field kitchens, and the refuse from the whole of the quarters was removed daily by the Council. Continual supervision was exercised by the Inspector of Nuisances—working in co-operation with the military officers—until the departure of the troops in the middle of November, when the hotel and the private houses were given up. At the end of the year the Cavalry Barracks only were occupied by a contingent of King Edwards' Horse. Dust Removal and Scavenging. The house refuse is collected by the Council's own staff once a week; and is disposed of by cremation in a two cell front feed Horsfall destructor situated at the sewage disposal works. The collection of refuse and the general scavenging of the district is carried out under the supervision of the Surveyor in a very satisfactory manner. 18 Sewerage and Sewage Disposal. The district is divided into areas for the collection of sewage, which is discharged by gravity into Shone ejectors; from which it is forced by compressed air through cast iron mains to the sewage disposal works; the power being obtained from a pair of horizontal steam engines. An extra pair of engines have been fixed recently to relieve the strain on the old ones, which have been in continual use since 1898. The sewage disposal works are situated in Hanworth Road, almost on the northern boundary of the district. The sewage is delivered at the works under pressure, and after screening, is conducted in a covered channel to a large hydrolytic tank, where the grosser matters are arrested. This tank effluent is then distributed on to the primary and—after treatment—to the secondary percolating filters of clinker by means of two mechanically propelled travelling distributors. The effluent from the secondary percolating filters is then treated in a secondary settling tank, after which it is further purified in the fine tertiary filters. The resulting effluent is clear and non-putrescible, and is discharged into the River Thames below Hampton Court. The sludge from the hydrolytic tank is buried in trenches in the land. Belgian Refugees. About forty refugees were receiving hospitality in the district at the close of the year, and this number has since increased. 19 Three houses were taken and furnished, and apartments have been provided in private residences. This work of relief is controlled by a Committee of local residents of both sexes, and the whole of the expenses are met by voluntary subscriptions. I enclose copies of the returns for the Local Government Board, the Home Office and the County Council. A tabular statement showing the work carried out by the Inspector of Nuisances during the year is also forwarded to be incorporated in this report. I gladly take this opportunity to thank Mr. A. Shail, Inspector of Nuisances, for his valuable assistance in carrying out my duties. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, A. D. OWEN.
