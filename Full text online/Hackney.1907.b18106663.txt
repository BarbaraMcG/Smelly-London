FOR THE YEAR 1907. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, Town Hall, Hackney, N.E. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney. Gentlemen, I beg to present herewith my Sixteenth Annual Report of the Public Health of the Borough of Hackney. From a public health point of view the year 1907 must be regarded as very satisfactory. The annual death rate was extremely low, although slightly higher than that for the year 1906. The infant mortality rate, which was 116 per 1,000 births is most encouraging, being the lowest on record for Hackney. Amongst the infectious diseases scarlet fever showed an excessive incidence during the year. This excess appears to be associated with school influences. I am pleased to state that the officers of the Public Health Department have on the whole carried out the duties entrusted to them to my entire satisfaction. During the year the Public Health Department lost the services of Miss Newton, the Inspector of Outworkers Premises, 6 who was appointed to an Inspectorship of Factories under the Home Office. Miss Newton was an extremely able and conscientious Inspector and rendered excellent service to the Borough. Population and Density.—Applying the rate of increase of population during the last intercensal period to the year 1907, I estimate the population of the Borough of Hackney at the end of June to be 232,081 persons. The density of the whole Borough has thus increased to 70.6 persons per acre, varying from 501 in the North Sub.District to 104 4 persons per acre in the South.West Sub.District. The following table gives the population and density of the Sub.districts of the Borough compared with the whole of London:— Table Showing estimated Population, Area and Density of the Registration Sub.Districts in Hackney, at middle of 1906. North. Central. Southwest. South. East. Total for Hackney Total for London. Estimated Population 54,265 55,352 61,120 61,344 232,081 4,758,218 Area in square acres 1,082 856 585 764 3,287 74,839 Density—persons per acre 50.1 64.6 104.4 80.3 70.6 63.4 Marriages and Marriage Rates.—During the year 1907 there were 1906 marriages solemnized in the Borough of Hackney. The annual rate of persons married for this period is, therefore, 16 4 per 1,000 of the estimated population. The marriage rate for all London for the same period is 17 per 1,000 of the population. The following table gives the number of marriages and the marriage rates for the Borough of Hackney and London for the ten years, 1897.1906 *I have here to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. Tom Hosgood, Superintendent Registrar, who has kindly abstracted for me the number of marriages for tne year 1907. 7 Year.

This shows a diminution in the number of births of 105 on the number registered during the previous year. The annual birth rate for the Borough for the year in question is therefore 24.8 per 1,000 living. The table below gives the number of births registered in the different Sub.Districts with their respective birth rates compared with that of London. The birth rate for London for the same period is 25.8 per 1,000 living. Illegitimate Births and Birth Rates.—There were 304 illegitimate births registered in the Borough of Hackney during the year, but of these 186 occurred in the Salvation Army Rescue Home, Mare Street: 180 of which were of mothers from places outside of Hackney. Deducting these 180 from the total registered, there remain 124 illegitimate births amongst the population of Hackney during 1907. This is equivalent to an illegitimate birth rate of 215 8 per 1,000 births. Below is given the rates for the different Sub. Districts of the Borough. Table. Births. Registration District of Hackney.

On the other hand, 401 "residents "of Hackney died in institutions outside the Borough. Making the needed corrections, the correct number of deaths amongst Hackney residents during the year was 3,229. This total shows an increase of 98 deaths upon the number which occurred during 1906. The general death rate of Hackney from all causes for the year 1907 is therefore 13 9 per 1,000 of the population. On making further correction for age and sex distribution, by means of the factor 1.04262, we obtain for the Borough for the year 1907 the true general death.rate of 14.49 per 1,000 of the population. The mortality rate for 1906 was 14.17 per 1,000 living, so the rate for 1907 shows a small increase upon the rate for the previous year. Taking the sub.districts, I find the lowest death rate for the year in the North sub.district (11.8 per 1,000) and the highest in the South. East sub.district (15.1 per 1,000). The annual death rate from all causes for London during 1907 is 15.35 per 1,000 living. Sub.District. Population. No. of Births. Birthrate. Total Deaths. Death. rate. Deaths under 1 year.

Hackney. London. Year. Hackney. London 1898 17.10 18.4 1903 14.7 15.7 1899 17.9 19.6 1904 16.05 16.6 1900 17.4 18.6 1905 15.01 15.1 1901 16.6 17.1 1906 14.17 15.1 1902 16.0 17.2 1907 14.49 15.35 Infant Mortality. The deaths of infants under one year of age in the Borough during the year 1907 numbered 667. This is a decline of 54 on the number registered during the previous year. The infant mortality therefore for the year 1907 is 116 per 1,000 births, that for 1906 being 123 per 1,000 births. The decline in the infant death rate during last year equals 7 per 1,000 births. This saving of infant life is no doubt largely to be ascribed to the low temperature prevailing during the third quarter of last year, which led to a diminished mortality from diarrhceal diseases. Whilst this diminished infant death rate is encouraging, a rate of 116 per 1,000 births must be regarded as enormous, and would, I am sure, if properly appreciated, inspire amongst the members of the municipal authority an earnest resolve to do something to still further reduce the infant mortality of the Borough. Appended is a table giving the causes of deaths under one year in the Borough during 1907. From this it will be seen that 46 were due to the common infectious diseases, 66 to diarrhceal diseases, 242 to wasting diseases, 37 to tuberculous diseases, and 276 to other causes. The large number of deaths, 121, ascribed to premature births calls for some comment. Premature births may be regarded as due to either disease, want of nutrition, or violence in the course of employment or otherwise. How much is due respectively to each of these is impossible 11 to say; but the proportion of deaths of infants brought into the world in an immature state is so large—nearly one-fifth of the total infant mortality—as to call for some strenuous effort to deal with it. During the year 1907 an Act of Parliament was passed to provide for the early notification of births. The intention of this Act is that Medical Officers of Health shall receive the notification of births within 36 hours of the birth taking place. It is also intended that Local Authorities who adopt the Act—for it is an Adoptive Act—shall carry out its object by giving advice and instruction in infant hygiene and feeding to those who have charge of infants.

The annual death rate of persons at 65 years and upwards is 3.7 per 1,000 living. Deaths in Public Institutions.—During the year 1907 there were 1,301 deaths in Public Institutions in the Borough. Of these 493 were residents of other districts, and the remainder 808 were residents of the Borough of Hackney.

During the year 1907 there were 2,805 cases of infectious disease compulsorily notified in the Borough; but of these 216 cases were subsequently found not to be suffering from infectious disease, thus reducing the genuine cases of notifiable disease to 2,589 cases, an increase of 846 upon the number notified in 1906. In addition, 157 cases of phthisis were voluntarily notified. The attack rate for the year in respect of the compulsorily notifiable infectious diseases is therefore 11.1 per 1,000 persons living. The deaths from the seven chief zymotic diseases numbered 325. This is equivalent to a zymotic death rate of 14 per 1,000 living persons in the Borough. A.— NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Small-Pox.— No case of this disease was notified in the Borough during the year 1907. Scarlet Fever.— The total number of cases of this disease notified in the Borough during 1907 was 1816, but of this number 119 were afterwards found not to be suffering from this disease. This reduces the number of genuine cases of scarlet fever to 1,697. This shows an increase of 700 cases upon the number notified during 1906. The attack rate of scarlet fever for the year 1907 is .3 per 1,000 living persons. During the first five months of the year the incidence of the disease was low, but in the first week of the month of June a rise set in which steadily increased with slight remissions until the third week in July, when 42 cases were notified in that week. During the next week ending July 27th a slight fall took place, which was continued into the following week. The lower incidence continued with fluctuations until the week ending 31st August, when a rise in the notifications occurred. From the first week in September until the third week in October a steady and rapid rise in the notifications took place, reaching in that week the abnormal number of 98. From 32 this time to the end of the year there was a steady fall in the notifications, with the exception of a rise in the month of November. At the end of the year the incidence had almost reached its normal point. These facts are shown graphically in the accompanying chart. The special feature connected with this outburst of scarlet fever is its relation to schools and school attendance. The outbreak may be said to have begun in the first week in June, steadily increasing until the last week in July, when a considerable fall took place, which was continued until the last week in August, after which the disease rapidly increased as described above. The period of remission during the month of August corresponded very closely with the summer closure of the schools, and the subsequent increase with their re-opening. Other evidence pointing to this outbreak being largely due to school attendance is forthcoming in the fact that not a few cases of desquamation were found amongst scholars still attending school— the discovery of such cases usually following the notification of some case of scarlet fever. An examination of the chart seems to show that the outbreak began before the Midsummer holidays, but that these holidays were insufficient to stop the course of the outbreak. From the point of view of preventive medicine, I think this outbreak affords an illustration where the medical inspection of scholars prior to the resumption of school work would have been of immense value in preventing the spread of infectious disease. One is constantly meeting with this rise in the incidence of infectious disease immediately after the long summer holidays; and in this particular case I am of opinion that if it had been possible to examine all the children attending the infants' departments at the opening of the schools, the outbreak would not have assumed the proportions it did. In private schools, after long holidays, no child is taken back unless provided with a certificate that the child is free from infectious disease and has not knowingly been exposed to such during the holidays. I do not think it is practicable to apply this system to the Council's schools: 33 but I think the children at least of the infants' departments should be medically examined after the summer holidays before being allowed to commence school-work. If this were done I believe it would result in a diminished prevalence of infectious disease. The number of cases of scarlet fever removed to hospital during the year was 1647. This amounts to 90.6 per cent. of the total notified. The following table shows the dates of removal of these cases in relation to the date of notification:— SCARLET FEVER—1907. Nursed at Home. Removed to Hospital. Removal to Hospital after Notification. Before Receipt of Notification. Same Day as Notification Received. 1 Day. 2 Days. 3 Days. 4 Days. 6 Days. Over 7 Days. 169 1,153 448 35 4 3 1 2 1 Total Cases Removed, 1647. The following table shows the distribution of the disease in the respective sub-districts of the Borough. Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Cases of Scarlet Fever. 220 621 481 494 Attack rate per 1,000. 4.0 11.2 7.8 8.0 This table shows that the disease was most prevalent in the Central sub-district. The deaths from scarlet fever numbered 45. This is equivalent to a mortality of 26 per 1,000 attacked and .19 per 1,000 living persons. The mortality rate for London during the same period is .14 per 1,000 living persons. c 34 Diphtheria and Membranous Croup.— The number of cases of diphtheria and membranous croup notified during 1907 was 552; of these 82 were found subsequently not to be cases of this disease, thus reducing the genuine cases of diphtheritic disease to 470. This is an increase of 134 upon the number of cases notified during 1906. The attack rate for the year is 2.0 per 1,000 persons living. As may be seen by the chart, the incidence of the disease was fairly low during the year until the end of September, from which time to the end of the year it was more prevalent. The total number of cases removed to hospital was 470. This amounts to 85 per cent. of the total notified. The following shows the distribution of diphtheritic disease in the various sub-districts of the Borough during 1907 :— Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Cases of Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. 109 173 133 137 Total attack rate per 1000. 20 31 21 2.2 From the above it is evident that diphtheritic disease was most prevalent in the Central sub-district and least prevalent in the North sub-district. The deaths during the year from diphtheria and membranous croup numbered 48. This is equivalent to a death-rate of 10 2 per cent. of those attacked and .2 per 1,000 living persons. The mortality rate from diphtheritic disease for all London is .16 per 1,000 living persons. Daring the year 246 swabbings from the throats of persons suspected to be suffering from diphtheria were bacteriologically examined; of these examinations 81 gave positive and 158 negative, and 7 doubtful results. 35 Typhoid or Enteric Fever.— During 1907 there were 109 cases of enteric fever notified in the Borough. Of these 13 were proved afterward not to have been cases of the disease. The genuine cases of typhoid therefore numbered 96. This is slightly in excess (15 cases) of the number of genuine cases notified during last year. The attack rate for the year is therefore .41 per 1,000 living persons. The disease was prevalent in Hackney during the whole year, but not markedly so. There was a slight seasonal increase during the months of September, October and November. Of the cases notified 93 were removed to hospital, which is equal to 89 per cent. The following table gives the distribution of the cases in the sub-districts of the Borough. Sub-Districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Cases of Typhoid. 17 45 22 25 Attack rate per 1,000 living. .31 .81 .36 .40 This table shows the incidence of the disease to be greater in the Central and South-East sub-districts than in the other sub-districts. The deaths from enteric fever numbered 22, which is equivalent to an annual mortality of. nearly 23 per cent. attacked and .09 per 1,000 living persons. The mortality rate for all London for the same period is .04 per 1,000 persons living. During the year 23 specimens of blood from persons suspected to be suffering from enteric or typhoid fever were examined; of c 2 36 these 11 gave the re-action known as " Widal's," and 12 gave negative results. Typhus.— One case of fever was notified as being typhus fever, but it was subsequently proved not to be a case of this disease. Continued Fever.— Two cases of fever were notified during the year as continued fever. Puerperal Fever.— Sixteen cases of puerperal fever were notified in the Borough during 1907, of which 11 were removed to hospital. The deaths from this disease numbered 7. This is equivalent to a death-rate of 43.7 per cent. attacked. The attack rate per 1,000 births is 2.7, and the mortality per 1,000 births 1.2. Plague.— No case of this disease occurred in the Borough of Hackney during 1907. Erysipelas.— The cases of erysipelas notified in Hackney during 1907 numbered 304, being equivalent to an attack rate of 1.3 per 1,000 living persons. Of the total notified 99 were removed to hospital, which is equal to more than 32 per cent. There were 13 deaths ascribed to erysipelas during the year. This is equal to a death rate of 4.2 per cent. attacked, and .05 per 1,000 living. Below is given the distribution of the disease in the several subdistricts of the Borough. Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Cases of Erysipelas. 33 55 149 67 Rate per 1,000 living. .8 1.0 .8 2.4 37 Cerebro-spinal Fever.— On the 26th of February, 1907, the London County Council made an Order that cerebro-spinal fever (epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis) should be a notifiable disease in the County of London for the period of six calendar months. The Local Government Board confirmed this Order, and the Order came into operation on the 13th March. At the expiration of this period the Order was extended for a further period of eighteen months. During the year 1907 there were four cases notified as cerebrospinal fever. In three of these cases the diplococeus intra-cellularis was isolated from the spinal fluid. On examination of the houses occupied by these cases nothing was discovered which could be regarded as an exciting cause of the disease; neither could they be associated with other cases. B. NON-NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Influenza.— This disease was the cause of 28 deaths in the Borough during 1907. This is an increase of 7 on the number occurring during 1906. The death rate is equal to .12 per 1,000 living persons, that for all London to .2 per 1,000. Chicken-Pox.— No deaths from this disease occurred in the Borough during 1907. Diarrhœa.— During 1907 there were 87 deaths due to diarrhœa and 9 to enteritis. Compared with the previous year there was a decline of 118 in the deaths from diarrhœa. The death rate from this cause for Hackney is .37 per 1,000 living persons. The mortality rate for London for the same period is .32 per 1,000 living persons. The distribution of the deaths from diarrhœa is given below:— 38 Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Deaths from Diarrhoea. 8 23 22 34 Death-rate per 1,000 living. .14 .4 .36 .55 Measles.— There were 58 deaths from measles in the Borough during 1907. This is a slight decline upon the number during 1906, when the deaths numbered 61. The mortality rate for 1907 is .20 per 1,000 living. The death rate for all London is .38 per 1,000. The following table gives the distribution of the deaths in the different sub-districts:— Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Deaths from Measles. 9 22 11 16 Mortality rate per 1,000 living. .16 .39 .18 .26 During the year under review information was received from the headmasters of elementary schools of 1,267 cases of measles occurring amongst their scholars or at their homes. In each of these cases a leaflet on the prevention of the spread of measles was dispatched to the parent. Whooping Cough.— There was an increased prevalence of this disease in the Borough during 1907. The deaths numbered during the year 65, against 31 during 1906. The death rate for last year from this disease is, therefore, .28 per 1,000 living persons. 39 The death rate for all London for the same period is .38 per 1,000 living. The following shows the distribution of the deaths from whooping cough in the Borough :— Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Deaths from Whooping Cough. 12 18 16 19 Mortality rate per 1,000 living. .22 .32 .26 .30 During the year information was received from the headmasters of elementary schools in the Borough of the existence of 678 cases of whooping cough. In each of these cases a leaflet on the prevention of the spread of whooping cough was dispatched to the parent. CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. Tuberculosis.— During the year 1907 there were 157 cases of pulmonary phthisis in Hackney, notified by medical practitioners. This is an increase of 117 upon the number notified during the previous year. Bateriological examination of sputa from 76 suspected cases was made during the same period. In 17 of these cases the examination revealed the presence of the bacillus of tuberculosis, and in the remaining cases the results were negative. During the year there were 372 deaths in the Borough due to tuberculous disease, which are classified as follows :— Tuberculous Phthisis 197 Phthisis 61 General Tuberculosis 42 Tuberculous Meningitis 41 ,, Peritonitis 10 Tabes Mesenterica 6 Tubercle of other Organs 15 372 40 The annual mortality rate for tuberculous disease for Hackney is 16 per 1,000 living. The deaths are distributed in the different sub-districts as follows:— Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Deaths from Tuberculous Disease. 67 76 133 96 Mortality rate per 1,000 living. 1.2 1.3 2.1 1.5 Cancer.— The number of deaths in Hackney due to this disease during 1907 was 198. This is 23 deaths more than the number dying from the same disease during 1906. The annual death rate is .81 per 1,000 living. The deaths are distributed in the sub-districts in the following proportions:— Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Deaths from Cancerous Disease. 50 49 53 46 Mortality rate per 1,000 living. .92 .88 .86 .75 Below is given a table showing the number of deaths and death rates in this Borough during the ten years ending 1907:— Borough of Hackney.

ALCOHOLISM. During 1907 there were 6 deaths ascribed to acute alcoholic poisoning. In addition there were 35 deaths from cirrhosis of the liver, a disease due in almost all cases to excessive indulgence in alcohol. VACCINATION. The following table is a summary of the Vaccination Officer's returns for the half-year ending June 30th, 1906. During this period there were 2,971 births registered in the Borough, and of these 1,583 were successfully vaccinated. Of the remainder, certificates of conscientious objection were received in respect of 65 births, 261 died unvaccinated, vaccination was postponed on a medical certificate in 28 cases, 632 removed to other districts or to unknown places, and 382 are entered as not being accounted for. 42 Return made on the 8th February, 1908, by the Vaccination Officers of the Hackney Union, respecting the Vaccination of Children whose Births were registered in their Districts from 1st January to 30th June, 1907. inclusive. Registration Subdistricts comprised in the Vaccination Officer's District. Number of Births returned in the " Birth List Sheets " as registered from 1st Jan. to 30th June, 1907.

This is slightly less than during the corresponding half-year of 1906. The proportion during this latter half-year was 57 per cent. PUBLIC HEALTH LEGISLATION, 1907. Butter and Margarine Act, 1907.— An Act to make further provision with respect to the manufacture, importation and sale of butter and margarine, and similar substances. Factory and Workshop Act, 1907.— An Act to amend the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, with respect to Laundries, and to extend that Act to certain institutions and to provide for the inspection of certain premises. Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907.— An Act to enable regulations to be made for the prevention of danger arising to public health from the importation, preparation, storage and distribution of articles of food. Notification of Births Act, 1907.— This is an Adoptive Act which became law on the 28th August, 1907. It is an Act to provide for the early notification of births. It enacts that in any area where it has been adopted by any local authority, it shall be the duty of the father of every child born, if he is actually residing in the house where the birth takes place, and also of any person in attendance upon the mother at the time of, or within six hours after, the birth, to give notice in writing of the birth to the Medical Officer of Health of the said district. This notice may be given by posting a prepaid addressed letter or postcard, or delivering a written notice of the birth, to the Medical Officer of Health at his office or residence. The local authority must supply addressed and stamped postcards containing 44 the form of notice to any medical practitioner or midwife who may apply for the same. The penalty for failure to give notice as required by the Act is, on summary conviction, not exceeding twenty shillings. No penalty shall be incurred where a person satisfies the Court that he had reasonable grounds for believing that the notice had been duly given by some other person. This notification is in addition to the usual notice required to be made to the Registrar of Births; and where the Act is adopted, the Medical Officer of Health must grant access to notices of birth received by him to the Registrars of the district for the purpose of obtaining information concerning births which may have occurred in their sub-districts. The notification shall apply to any child which has issued from its mother after the expiration of the twentyeighth week of pregnancy, whether alive or dead. If a local authority adopt the Act it must be by resolution passed at a meeting of the Council; and one calendar month's notice must be given before the meeting. A resolution of adoption cannot take effect until it has received the consent of the Local Government Board. After consent of the Local Government Board, it shall be the duty of the local authority to make the provisions of the Act known to all medical practitioners and midwives practising in its district. In London the Medical Officers of Health of the Metropolitan Boroughs are required to send a weekly list of all notices of births received by them under the Act, to the London County Council. The Local Government Board may by order declare the Act to be in force in the area of any local authority if they think it expedient. After a resolution of adoption of the Act by a local authority, it shall be published by advertisement in one or more newspapers circulating in the district for the purpose of giving notice thereof to interested persons. A resolution of adoption shall not come into 45 operation until at least one month after the first publication of the advertisement. Vaccination Act, 1907.— An Act to substitute a Statutory Declaration for the Certificats required under Section 2 of the Vaccination Act, 1898, of Conscientious Objection. PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891. (а) Complaints of Nuisances.— During the year 1907 there were 2,058 complaints of nuisances investigated by the Inspectors of the Borough. Notices were served on the appropriate persons for the abatement of any nuisances found. (b) Infectious disease.— There were 2,504 dwellings inspected during the year in which notifiable infectious disease had occurred. This is an increase of 731 dwellings upon the number inspected after infectious disease during 1906. Any nuisances found were dealt with in the usual way under the provision of the above Act. (c) House to House Inspections.— The inspections made during the year under this head numbered 1,043. These inspections have taken place in all parts of the Borough, particularly in Homerton and London Fields districts. These inspections are independent of those made after complaint or after the occurrence of infectious disease. The nuisances found on inspection were abated in the majority of cases on the service of an Intimation Notice alone. Of such notices 3,986 were served. It was necessary, in addition, to serve 501 Statutory Notices and to initiate legal proceedings in 11 instances to secure the abatement of certain nuisances. The result of the prosecutions is given in the appendix to this report. The following details refer to the house to house inspections made by the special inspectors appointed for this purpose. 46 Details of house to house inspections made in the London Fields District during the year 1907 by Inspector Walter C.

DAIRIES, COW-SHEDS AND MILK-SHOPS. Cow-houses.—There are now 21 licensed cow-keepers in the Borough, with 32 cow-sheds. During the year one license for one cow-shed lapsed. The Inspector reports that he made 238 visits to d 50 these premises during the year, and served three notices for necessary repairs. On the 6th July, the Public Health Committee made an inspection of the cow-houses of the Borough. These were found on the whole to be in a clean and satisfactory condition, with the exception of three cow-houses. Two of these were dirty and the third was overcrowded, and there was an accumulation of manure on the premises. Dairies and Milk Shops.—During 1907 there were 31 milk places removed from the register and 36 added. At the end of 1907 there remained 373 milk places on the register. Two registered milksellers were summoned during the year for dirty milk utensils, one being fined £2 with £1 3s. costs, and the other £1 with £1 3s. costs. Inspector Bobbitt reports that he made 913 visits of inspection of these premises and discovered dirty measures on 28 of these visits. He served 13 notices for cleansing and repairs during the year. Offensive Trades.—There is only one offensive trade now licensed in the Borough, and that is a tripe-boiler. The Inspector reports that he made 12 visits to these premises during the year and found them in a satisfactory condition. Slaughter-Houses.— There are 25 slaughter-houses in the Borough. Inspector Bobbitt reports that he made 380 visits to these during the year. No nuisance was discovered requiring the service of a notice for its abatement. The Public Health Committee made their annual inspection of these slaughter-houses on the 6th July, 1907. In connection with these three were discovered in a dirty condition. With these exceptions, the slaughter-houses were found to be in a very satisfactory condition. 51 The following statement gives particulars as to the milk-places cowsheds, slaughter-houses, and offensive trades in the Borough.

Preserved Provisions Factories.—There are eight wholesale provision factories in the Borough. The Inspector made 83 visits to these during the year. On one of these inspections he discovered some ox intestines used for the making of blackpudding affected with the parasitic disease known as oesaphagostoma columbianum. They were seized and condemned by the Magistrate sitting at the North London Police Court. Subsequently the Public Health Committee ordered legal proceedings to be instituted d 2 52 against the manufacturers. The following is the report of the Public Health Committee to the Council on the circumstances of the case:— "We desire to call the attention of the Council to the prosecution of Messrs. Vornberger & Co., the result of which is set out in the Report of Legal proceedings now submitted." "In February last, Mr. Bobbitt, one of the Sanitary Inspectors, on visiting the premises of a local manufacturer, discovered some intestines of oxen, known in the trade as "ox runners" or "casings," and used in the making of black puddings, which were affected with a parasitic disease known as œsophagostoma columbianum. He therefore seized the casings, and they were condemned by the Magistrate at the North London Police Court as unfit for food. Several other seizures were made by Mr. Bobbitt about the same time, and it was found on enquiry that many of the casings had been purchased by the manufacturers from Messrs. Vornberger & Co." "The Committee, after considering representations made to them, and after weighing all the facts, were of opinion that proceedings should be instituted against Messrs. Vornberger & Co. rather than against the manufacturers, and a summons was thereupon taken out and heard at the Clerkenwell Police Court on the 30th April last." "Three defences were put forward by the Defendants, as follows:— (1) That the casings were not intended for the food of man, as the skins of black puddings were not eaten. (2) That the casings were not unwholesome or unfit for the food of man. (3) That at the time the casings were sold the Defendants did not know of their condition." 53 "The Town Clerk called the Medical Officer of Health and the Sanitary Inspectors as witnesses, and two persons who stated they were in the habit of eating the skins of black puddings. The Defendants called Professor Penberthy, of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, and Mr. Colwell, Public Analyst of Finsbury, who expressed the opinion that the skins, though possibly indigestible, were not injurious. The Magistrate decided in favour of the Council on the first two points, but gave the Defendants the benefit of the doubt on the third point, and dismissed the summons." "The case has been reported in the trade papers, and now that the unfitness of such casings for human food has been brought to the notice of the manufacturers, we do not anticipate that the need for any further proceedings will arise." Smoke Nuisances.—During 1907 the Smoke Inspector made 1,639 observations of chimney shafts of factories, workshops, &c., in the Borough. These observations lasted from half-an-hour upwards. The Intimation Notices served numbered 58 and the Statutory Notices 3, during the same period. Water Supply—Section 48 (2) Public Health (London) Act, 1891.—Under this section 20 certificates of proper and sufficient supply of water were issued under this section to owners of either new or rebuilt houses. The certificates refer to 61 houses and tenements. By-laws for Houses let in Lodgings.—During 1907 the whole of the Houses let in Lodgings registered in the Hackney Wick district were inspected. These numbered 226, of which 39 were empty. Of the remainder 73 required cleansing, 7 were overcrowded, and in 6 structural defects were found (defective drains) and in 65 no nuisance was discovered. The nuisances found were abated on the service of Intimation Notices. 54 CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACT, 1890. During the past year applications were made to me by five owners of tenement properties to inspect their property, with a view to giving certificates that the tenements were so constructed "as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or "persons dwelling therein, and that due provision is made for their "sanitary requirements," for the purpose of obtaining exemption from Inhabited House Duty. The five applications had reference to 51 tenements. These I inspected, and granted the required certificates, after the execution of certain necessary alterations. CANAL BOATS ACT, 1877-1894. The Canal Boats Inspector of the Borough reports that he made 80 visits to the waterways in the Borough during 1907, and inspected 41 canal boats. Amongst these he found only one infringment of the Regulations, i.e. the marking on the boat required by Act was not legible. The remainder of the boats were found to be in good repair, clean and habitable. ICE CREAM VENDORS. During the year 141 premises where ice creams are manufactured were inspected, and 13 notices for the abatement of nuisances were served. The nusiances were abated without necessitating further action. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890-1903. No representation was made under the above Acts during the past year. THE RIVER LEA.

This Congress was held in London during the summer of 1907, at which the Hackney Borough Council were represented by Councillor J. Barley and the Medical Officer of Health. The following are the Resolutions passed at the Sections and confirmed at the General Meeting:— Section I. The following resolution was passed in the Section by 50 votes to 1, but by an oversight was not reported at the General Meeting of the Congress:- "Objective instruction being far less fatiguing to the memory, and much better fitted to invigorate the intellectual powers than instruction which makes use of words only, it is desirable that systematic arrangements should be made for enabling both teachers and pupils to have constant access to sources of natural knowledge, including museums." Section II. Resolution I. of American School Hygiene Association, after Dr. Darlington's Paper:— Whereas the maintenance and development of the health and vigour of school children is a matter of paramount importance, and whereas experience in all large cities has shown the importance of health inspection, be it resolved that in every city and town adequate provision should be made both for sanitary inspection of schools and for medical inspection of school children, the latter to include not only inspection for contagious diseases, but also of eyes, ears, teeth, throat and nose, and of general physical condition. Section IV. Whereas the improvement in the health of and the hygienic conditions surrounding school children depends largely upon the intelligent operation, the competency, the interest, and the faithfulness of teachers aud principals in 69 matters of hygienic importance; therefore, be it resolved that all schools having courses for the training of teachers should give instruction in:— (a) Personal and School Hygiene; and (b) The principles and practice of physical training. And that to each of these subjects should be given as much time as the major subjects in the course. That this Section is of the opinion that the principles and practice of hygiene should form part of the education of every citizen. That practical and theoretical instruction in personal and school hygiene should form a regular part of the curriculum of all institutions in which students are trained to become teachers in schools of all grades. Section VII. That, in the opinion of this Congress, it is important to secure the prompt exclusion from school of scholars suspected to be suffering from or likely to convey infectious sickness, and that the Board of Education be urged to devise some means by which this can be done without as at present involving financial loss on the local education authority. Section X. In the opinion of this meeting it is desirable that all Secondary Schools, including Public Schools, should be subjected to inspection on matters relating to Hygiene and Sanitation, and that a copy of this Eesolution should be forwarded to the President of the Board of Education praying him to take such steps as he may consider necessary to carry such inspection into effect. DISINFECTION. (a) Rooms.—During the year 1907 there were 3,307 rooms fumigated, and 1,388 rooms cleansed by the Staff of the Public Health Department.

During the year 1907 there were 38,386 tons 2 cwts. 2 qrs. of house refuse removed from dwellings in the Borough to the Destructor, at a total cost of £8,028 12s. 9d. From the Northern Division 17,307 tons 18 cwts. 1 qr. of refuse was removed by the contractor, at the rate of 4s. per ton, and at a total cost of £3,461 12s. 1d. From the Southern Division 21,078 tons 12 cwts. 1 qr. was removed by the contractor, at the rate of 4s. 4d. per ton, and at a total cost of £4,567 0s. 8d. These figures show an increased quantity of house refuse removed compared with that of the year 1906. There was an increase of 423 tons 19 cwts., costing £66 1s. The cost of disposal of the house refuse during 1907, including the disposal of residue clinker, &c., has been estimated by the Borough Electrical Engineer at £6,397 15s. 0d at the rate of F 82 3s. 4d. per ton. The total cost for the removal and disposal of house refuse in the Borough during 1907 was £14,426 7s. 9d. Compared with 1906, this sum shows a saving of £258 17s. 10d. upon the total cost for 1906. This saving has been effected in the destruction of house refuse. Distributing the total cost of the year over the whole population of the Borough, it amounts to 1s. 2¾d. per head.

KING-WARRY, M.D., D.P.H., June 18th, 1908. Medical Officer of Health. 93 APPENDIX. Summary of certain Sections in the London County Council General Powers Bill, 1907, relating to Public Health and Sanitation, with Remarks of the Medical Officer of Health thereon Part IV.—Milk. 22. Gives power to the Medical Officer of the County or other person authorised by him to enter any dairy within the County accompanied hy a veterinary surgeon and inspect the cows, and if any cow is suspected to be suffering from tuberculous disease of the udder, to require the cow to be milked in his presence, and may take samples of the milk for examination from each teat. The Medical Officer is also required, if he is of opinion that tuberculosis is caused to persons in the County by consumption of milk from any dairy or cow in the County to report thereon to the Council, such report to be accompanied by a report from a veterinary surgeon. The Council may, on such report, call upon the dairyman to show cause why an Order should not be made prohibiting the supply of his milk to the County. Similar powers may be exercised in all respects by the Medical Officer and the London County Council where the Medical Officer has reason to believe that milk from dairies outside the County is causing or is likely to cause tuberculosis in persons residing in the County. Provided that in the latter case an Order must first be obtained from a Justice having jurisdiction in the place where the dairy is situated before entry and examination of the cows. There is no objection to these powers being conferred on the Medical Officer of the County provided that the Medical Officer of Health of each Metropolitan City or Borough shall, within his own district, have the same powers as the Medical Officer of the County. 94 Part V.—Sanitary Provisions. 33. Gives power to County Medical Officer of Health or person authorised by him in writing to take for examination samples of milk at railway stations and elsewhere in the County samples of milk intended for sale. If such milk be found for any reason unsound, or unwholesome or unfit for the food of man, power is given to the London County Council to prosecute for such selling or exposure. Power is also given to the London County Council to institute enquiries and make investigations for the purposes of this section. The same powers should be given to the Metropolitan Boroughs and their Medical Officer of Health, for they have more need of this power than the County Council. 34. Gives power to the Medical Officer, if he has reasonable cause to believe that infectious disease is caused in the County by milk, to require every person supplying milk to a sufferer or to any person in the same house, to supply him with a list of the farms, dairies or places from which he has derived his milk supplies during the last six weeks, and also a list of the persons supplied within such six weeks. The Council shall pay sixpence for each list, and sixpence for every twenty-five names. The same power should be given to the Borough Medical Officer of Health. 35. Requires every dairyman, whether within or without the County, supplying milk to the County, to notify to the London Couuty Council or their Medical Officer all cases of infectious disease amongst persons engaged in connection with his dairy, as soon as he is aware of the existence of such disease, under a penalty not exceeding 40s. The effect of this section will be to cause all such infectious disease occurring in the respective Boroughs to be notified to the London County Council. Such cases are already dealt with by the local Medical Officer of Health, and 95 extending the notification to the London County Council will lead to unnecessary duplication and expense. If the words "whether within or" are deleted from this section there would be no objection as modified. Part VI.—Milk Depots. 49. Gives power to Councils of Metropolitan Boroughs to establish depots for sale of milk for consumption by infants under two years of age. Such depot to be subject to the medical supervision of the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough establishing the same, and to be carried on in accordance with Regulation to be approved by the Council. If Regulations are to be approved, it seems more desirable that they should be approved by the Local Government Board. 50. Deals with the application of all moneys received from time to time in respect of any depdts so established. 51. Power to borrow for purposes of milk depot restricted to £1,000. Part VII.—Cleansing of Verminous Persons. 52. Gives the Medical Officer, or any person authorised in writing, power to examine the person and clothes of any child attending a London County Council school, and if the clothing or person of a child is found to be infested with vermin, or in a foul or filthy condition, such Medical Officer may give notice in writing to the parent or guardian requiring the cleansing of child and clothing within 24 hours. If the notice is not complied with within the prescribed time, he may send a copy of the notice to the Sanitary Authority for the district in which the school is situate, and such Sanitary Authority, or their Medical Officer of Health, or other person authorised by the Medical Officer of Health, shall cause the person and clothing of such child to be cleansed, and if necessary for that purpose may 96 without any warrant other than this Act convey to such premises and there detain such child until such cleansing is effected, but not later than 10 o'clock in the evening. If the Sanitary Authority fails to put in force within seven days after receipt of copy of notice these provisions, the London County Council may cleanse the person and clothing of the child and recover the expenses incurred from the defaulting Sanitary Authority. The examination of the person and clothing of children attending public elementary schools is practised at the present time, and in the interests of health it would not be advisable to oppose statutory sanction to make such examinations. On the other hand, I am of opinion it would not be desirable to support the proposal of the Council to forcibly take and cleanse children on the mere written authority of either the County Council, the Metropolitan Borough, or their Officers. The procedure which appears to me applicable to the case is, on the default of the parent or guardian of the child, for the Sanitary Authority to issue a Summons against the parent or guardian to appear before a stipendiary Magistrate to show cause why an Order shall not be made to take the child to suitable premises provided by the Sanitary Authority for the purpose of being cleansed. 53. Power is given to the Medical Officer or person authorised by him, to enter any common lodging-house and examine the person and clothing of any lodger, and if either is found verminous or filthy, to give such lodger a notice to submit himself and clothing within 24 hours at certain premises to be cleansed. At the same time the Medical Officer shall send a copy of the notice to the Sanitary Authority of the district in which the lodginghouse is situate. If the lodger does not comply with the notice within the time stated, the Sanitary Authority of the District in which the 97 lodging-house is situate, or their Medical Officer of Health or other person authorised, shall cause the person and clothing of the lodger to be forthwith cleansed in suitable premises, and may for that purpose enter any common lodging-house, and may, if necessary, without any warrant other than this Act, convey to any such premises and there detain such inmate until such cleansing is effected. If the Sanitary Authority fails to put in force within seven days after failure of the lodger to comply with the Medical Officer's notice these provisions, the London County Council may cleanse the person and clothing of the lodger and recover the expenses incurred from the Sanitary Authority in default. The same remarks apply to the proposal of the London County Council respecting the cleansing of filthy and verminous lodgers of common lodging-houses. But in this case the lodger should be summoned.
