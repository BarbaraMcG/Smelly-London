BARK 7 Arban District of Barking Town. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health and Sanitary Inspector FOR THE YEAR, 1905. BARKING: The Globe Press, Printers, Gascoigne Road. Part I. The Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health of the Dstrict of Barking Town for the Year ending December 31st, 1905. To the Chairman and Members of the Barking Town Urban District Council. Gentlemen, The population of the Urban District of Barking Town, estimated up to the middle of the year 1905 was 28,000. This, compared with the population as per census of 1901, shows an increase of 6,453. The number of houses in the Town during the month of October was about 5,200, and the number of empty houses 200; this gives the gross number of occupied houses as 5,000. The average number of persons per house, by the census of 1901, was 5'6, as against 5'5 in 1891. The number of inhabited houses in March, 1901, was 3,851 (census) shewing an increase up to date of 1,349. 6 Natural increase of Population. Deaths Births Natural Increase 1900 398 783 385 1901 383 799 416 1902 336 817 481 1903 357 856 499 1904 385 896 511 1905 397 900 503 Physical Features of the District. The general level of the district under the administration of the Urban District Council of Barking Town is low, as low in some parts as 6ft. above Ordnance datum. In spite of this however the district is well drained and there is no part of it which could be termed water-logged. The level of the subsoil water in the higher parts (e.g. at the Rippleside Cemetary which is 18ft. above o.d.) is about 12 ft. below the surface and in the lower (e.g. near the sewage works) the level was found about the same. The district is traversed on three sides by tidal streams, which fact no doubt explains to a large extent the fairly low level of the subsoil water, another and most important item being the construction of a subsoil drain underneath the pipe for the conveyance of sewage. When the sewer was laid in 1884, the level of the subsoil water dropped considerably. We find also the same thing happening wherever a new sewer is laid. These conditions together with the fact that the town is built upon a deep bed of gravel and also that rainfall is very low render the district dry, and I am glad to say progressingly healthy. The public water supply of the district is derived from the wells of the South Essex Company. I have made several analyses of the water, especially during the summer. I found it of excellent quality ; a recent analysis shewing the albuminoid ammonia to be Water Supply 7 only .0165 parts per 1000,000. Saline ammonia - .007 parts per 1,000,000. The question of the Creeksmouth Supply appears as far off solution as ever. With regard to the shallow wells in the district I have not been able to trace any case of disease thereto during the year, at the same time I am of opinion that several of them might be closed with advantage. The various deep wells in the district are as follows:— 1. Lawes Well, Creeksmouth. 2. Du Pass' „ „ 3. Mineral Water Manufactory, 2 wells. 4. Barking Brewery Well. 5. Well at the mill on Town Quay. 6. Deep well belonging to the Metropolitan Water Board. The first two on the list give a large amount of chlorides, probably owing to intermixture with Thames water. They are not fit for drinking purposes. The remainder give water of excellent quality. Appended is a recent list of premises still supplied by shallow wells:— Property. Source and Condition. Wellington Mill House Shallow well. Cottage adjoining (Public supply to be laid on at once). „ Two Cottages adjoining Longbridge Farm Shallow well. Bush Grove Farm „ Parsloe's Lodge „ Louse Hall Supplied by S.E.W. Scratton's Farm Shallow well.

Four Cottages adjoining „ Magazine Cottage From Lawes' well. Crooked Billet (Licensed House) Supplied from Town. Du Pass' Cottages From deep well. Magazine Cottage, Ripple Marsh No supply. Greatfields Farm House Shallow well Two Cottages adjoining „ Davey's Tar Works No Supply Food and Milk Supply. Large quantities of chilled foreign meat are sold in the town more especialy on Saturday evenings, at a very low price. The very poorest, if they have any money at all are thus able to procure a joint of meat at trifling cost. The shops and stalls where this and other articles of diet are sold have been systematically inspected, but in no case has there been any occasion to interfere. With regard to the milk supply it is convenient to divide the question into two sections:— 1. Premises concerned in the production of the milk. 2. Those concerned in the storage and handling of the milk. In both there is great need for a fresh system of working. 1st There are five dairies in the district where cows are kept and from whence milk is distributed over the town. I give a list of these, shewing their present condition:— 2nd I give a list of dairies where the milk is stored and handled, with their present condition—where cows are not kept. 3rd. Milk Shops.

I trust that in my next report I may be able to record the introduction of more up-to-date and sanitary methods in connection with this important industry. Bakehouses. There are 16 bakehouses now in use in the district. I have personally inspected these twice during the year and am of opinion that they all comply with the requirements of the Factory and Workshop Act as regards (a) Overcrowding. (b) Ventilation. (c) Light. (a little doubtful in one or two). (d) Communication with bedroom. (e) „ with w.c. ashpits or privy. (f) Cleanliness and Whitewashing. (g) Drain openings. (h) Water Supply One which I reported as dirty, &c. has been renovated. I have examined several samples of bread during the year and have always found it of good quality, Slaughter Houses. The three registered slaughter houses remain in much the same condition as formerly. There are plans in preparation for the re-building of one which is at present in an exceedingly insanitary tate, which when erected will be a real sanitary gain to that part of the town. The proper cleansing and removal of offal in respect to these premises is fairly well carried out. The one licensed slaughter house is kept in good order. The license is renewable annually. Knackers Yard—The license of these premises has been renewed by the Council for another year. No complaint of nuisance was received during the year, and the premises are now in good condition. 13 Burial Grounds. Cemetery—This continues in good order. 4,450 interments have taken place since it was opened. St. Margaret's Churchyard.—This continues in good order. The Friends' Burying Ground.—This is still a model of neatness and order. Rivers and Streams of District. There has been very little complaint of the nuisance arising from the river Roding this year. From further observation I am convinced that a very large proportion of pollution is traceable to the northern outfall works of the L.C.C. though I quite admit the seriousness of the pollution arising above the mill gates. Chief Industries of District. 1. Beckton Gas Works.—This includes all kinds of labour : coal- porters, general labourers, stokers, engineers, &c. 2. Lawes' Chemical Manure Works.—There are several ments here also : a. Manufacture of Manure and Disinfectants. b Manufacture of Sheep Dip, in connection with which I have received no further complaints of arsenical poisoning since my last Report. c The manufacture of Strong Acids. 3. Agriculture. 4. Warne's India Rubber Mills. 5. Tar Works and several Factories of a similar nature, 6. A large and increasing number of the population are workers from the Metropolis. 7. Glass bottle Manufacture. 14 Inspection of District. There is now very little slum property in the district. The houses for the most part are of the cottage type with small forecourts and back gardens, the whole tenement situated on a plot of land about 12 feet x 75 - 90. fronting a road 40 feet wide. Every house is by the bye-laws compelled to provide a back entrance which means long lengths of back ways, which soon get into bad condition unless properly looked after, or, as in the Council's houses cemented over. In order to fill up depressions in the path &c. people will put down cinder ash, potato peelings, and all sorts of refuse which in wet weather renders the back ways in a most insanitary condition. For these and other reasons not sanitary I think the bye-law should be done away with. The drain coming under one house in a dozen or so properly constructed, could do no harm and I do not see any reason why the dust brought through the house would injure anybody. I append a revised list of the various courts and alleys with their present condition:— 15 Properties which have been re-drained and otherwise improved and suggestions for further improvement. Name of Property. Sanitary Improvements Required. St. John's Retreat. Partially re-drained These houses are now undergoing repair The surface of the court also is to be rendered more sanitary. Red Lion Place Has been re-drained and requires paving Alma Place Has been re-drained. The surface of the court should be drained and repaired where necessary. Back Reform Place The main drain which receives the drainage from these houses, and also from Reform Place, North Street, has been relaid and ventilated. The house connections have partially attended to. Nelson Street *The main drains have been relaid and ventilated, and the house connections re-instated. Trafalgar Street Trafalgar Square Trafalgar Place Back Lane The drains of Nos. 1 to 22 need re-laying Instructions have been given to the Surveyor to carry this work out. (See Sanitary Minutes Feb. 2nd and March 2nd, 1900.) Bifron's Square The drains belonging to this property have been reconstructed and ventilated. A w.c. has been provided for each house. The surface of the square has been made up with a road, curbed and channelled. * These Streets have been made up under the 150 section. They should be now regularly scavenged. 16 Inspection of District—continued. Name of Property, Sanitary Improvements Required. The houses themselves hare been modernised in appearence, and thoroughly renoverated inside, and are let at a rental of 5s. per week. Linsdell's Court The surface of the court has been made up under the 150th section of the Public Health Act, 1875, and the houses are now let at a rental of 4s. per week. Orchard Avenue The houses have been put in good repair and are now all occupied. Morgan's Yard The sewer has been relaid and ventilated and the court paved. Morgan's Quay The main sewer has been relaid and ventilated, and the road made up. The paving at the back of the houses has been laid. The yard needs scavenging. Factory Road and Emily Cottages These drains have been re-constructed and ventilated. The houses have been modernised, thoroughly cleansed and renovated. The back yards have been concreted and divided off in Factory Rd. In Emily Cottages the back yards have been concreted but not divided. Park Terrace The sewers belonging to these properties need ventilating and re-constructing. Albert Terrace Collier Row 17 Inspection of District—continued. Name of Property. Sanitary Improvements required. Collier Place The drains belonging to this property have been re-constructed and ventilated. Crook's Corut It is now owned by the Council and is utilised by the Electric Department. Morgan's Court, East St. The owners have demolished part of this property. The remainder is just habitable. Barking Place The sewer has been re-laid and ventilaled The Court needs scavenging badly. Garden Place These properties, all situated in Axe Street, have been re-sewered, fresh w.c. accommodation, and flushing cisterns provided. The yards are now partially paved. They need scavenging badly. Suffolk Place Wellington Buildings Parson's Buildings Padnell Place Arthur Cottages, East St. This property is now in the possession of the Railway Company and already partly demolished. 18 Drains found to be defective but not yet dealt with. North Street. St. John's Retreat partly requires attention urgently (Nos. 1—4.) Northbury Cottages. Defective, and should be re-laid. 70-76 North Street needs re-laying and ventilating. 90-92 Require ventilating and repairing. 109-119 Need re-laying. 85-103 Need ventilating. 105-7.8 Need re-laying (? private drain). 39-47 Need re-laying. 4-6 Need re-laying. 14-16 Need re-laying. 52-60 Need re-laying. Broadway. 29-31 Need re-laying, etc. 12 Needs ventilating and re-laying. 44 50 Need ventilating and re-laying. 41-43 Need re-laying and ventilating. 45 Needs re-laying. (? private drain.) 39 Needs ventilating and perhaps re-laying. 33 Needs ventilating, etc. 25-27 Need re-laying and ventilating. Heath Street. 5 Needs re-laying. 1-3 Need re-laying. Axe Street. 49-59 Need ventilating and possibly re-laying. Fish Offal Collection. I have not received any notice of default by the contractor. Scavenging. This is still carried out by the Council's men. I am of opinion that certain parts of the town should be dealt with, which at present are not kept in a proper sanitary condition, i e Barking Place, Garden Place, Wellington Buildings, Parson's Buildings, Padnell Place, &c. 19 Collection of House Refuse. The house refuse is collected from almost every house in the district once in seven days. At holiday time however, the work gets a little behind for a few weeks. There are about 5,000 calls to be made weekly or about 850 houses per day to be visited. Four carts are at work with a driver and two men to e.ach cart, so that each cart and men must collect the dust from 200 to 250 houses per diem. A very large amount of time is lost by reason of the men having to collect the bins from the back yards and carry them in many instances 40 or 50 yards before reaching the cart. It would no doubt be a very great saving of time and labour if the occupiers, where possible, brought their dustbins in to the forecourt of the house for emptying and cleansing. The cost of collecting the house refuse for the year ending March, 1905, was £.1,088, or exactly 1d. per week per house. Sewerage and Sewage Disposal. The treatment of the Sewage by precipitation in tanks after the addition of a certain amount of alumino ferric is still adhered to, and no complaint has been received from the Thames Conservancy Board during the year with regard to the effluent. The accumulation of sludge was becoming rather large, but a good deal of this has now been got rid of. In the rural portion of the district cesspools and their overflows are a great nuisance, and I think the Council would be well advised, both financially and from a sanitary point of view, to invest in a suitable machine for emptying them. Offensive Trades. There is no licensed "Offensive Trade" in the District. I think bye-laws should be adopted for the regulation of such trades. 20 Bye=Laws. The Bye-laws adopted in this District deal with the following subjects. 1. Cleansing of footways and pavements, removal of house refuse, cleansing of earth closets, privies, ashpits, and cesspools. (Public Health Act 1875, sec. 44). 2. Prevention of Nuisances arising from snow, filth, dust, ashes, rubbish, and of the keeping of animals on any premises so as to be injurious to health. (Public Health Act 1875, sec. 44). 3. The regulation and management of common lodging houses. (Public Health Act 1875, sec. 80). Those dated 1884 now in force. 4. The regulation of houses let in lodgings. (Public Health Act 1875, sec. 90). 5. There are no regulations dealing with Offensive Trades. (Public Health Act 1875, sec 113). 6. The regulation of Public Mortuaries. (Public Health Act 1875' sec. 141). 7. The management of Public Cemeteries. (Public Health Act, 1875, sec. 141, and Public Health Interment Act, 1879). The Burial Board Regulations 1885 are still in force, with some amendments, 1902. 8. The construction and arrangement of new streets and buildings, and the closure of buildings unfit for human habitation. (Public Health Act, 1875, sec. 157). Those dated 1884 now amended in force. 9. The construction and arrangement of new buildings, the moval of refuse therefrom, and provision for flushing w.cs. (Public Health Act Amendment Act, 1890, sec. 23). 21 10. The management and regulation of Knackers Yards and Slaughter Houses. (Public Health Act 1875, sec. 69, and Towns' Improvement Clauses Act 1847.) Dated 1890 now in force. 11. There are no Regulations re Lodging and accomodation of hop and fruit pickers. (Public Health Act 1875, sec. 314, and Fruit Pickers' Lodging Act, 1882.) There are no Bye-laws re— 12. Decent conduct of persons using Public Sanitary ences. (Public Health Act Amendment Act, 1890, sec. 29.) 13. Removal of filth, time, construction of receptacles, and cleansing of places fouled. (Public Health Act Amendment Act, 1890. sec. 26.) 14. Imposition on occupiers of duty of facilitating removal of filth by Local Authority. (Public Health Act Amendment Act, 1890, sec. 26.) 15. Regulation and management of moveable dwellings ing of the Working Classes Act, 1885, sec. 10.) 16. Providing means of escape from fire in factories and shops (Factory and Workshops Act, sec. 15 to 18.) Regulations. The following Regulations are in force in this District:— 1. Bakehouses. 2. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops' Order, 1885. 3. Mortuary Regulations. 4. Method of joining house drains and sewers. (Public Health Act, 1875, sec. 21.) (The Council make all the connections.) 5. Management of Public Sanitary Conveniences. (Public Health Act Amendment Act.) 6. Paving Regulations. Adoptable Acts of Parliament: Public Health Act Amendment Act, 1890, part iii.; Infectious Disease Prevention Act, 1890 ; Private Street Works Act. 1892; Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, part iii. 22 Housing of the Working Classes. The number of cottages at a low rental has greatly increased during the past year. Numbers, which were formerly let at 6s. 6d or 7s. per week, can now be had for 5s. 6d. inclusive. Some of these contain four rooms and a washhouse, but for the most part consist of four rooms and no washhouse. I am of opinion that these small houses are a great benefit to the labouring classes, and are a great advance on the separated double tenement system. I think the incidence of infectious disease in the several Wards shews that infectious disease at all events is not increased by the erection of these houses, for, taking the number of infectious cases for the four Wards of the town viz 1903-4-5, I find that the South Ward where most of this class of property is situated, shews no preponderence of notifications. 1903.

At the present time 157 cottages are owned by the Council, the rents being 5s. 6d., 6s. 9d., and 7s. 0d. These are all on the separate tenement system and are let fairly well. Those rented at 5s. 6d. per week especially. The empties, and irrecoverables in connection with the King Edward Road Houses for the year 1904 -5 works out at 3.2 per cent. of the total rent. The number of houses in the town now letting at an inclusive rental of 5s. 6d. per week and under, has now reached a total of 1724. The number in Jan. 1,905 was 1,368, showing an increase during the year of 356. 23 The size of the rooms in the Council's houses, letting at 5s. 6d. per week is as follows:— Front room downstairs 10ft. x 9ft. 6in. Back „ „ 12 x 12 Front bedroom upstairs 12 6 x 9 6 Back „ „ 12 3 x 9 6 The measurements for similar houses built by private contract:— Front room downstairs 10ft. x lift. Back „ ,, 9 x 11 Front bedroom upstairs 10 x 11 Back „ 9 x 11 less Staircase 5ft. x2ft. Gin. As to cost. The cost of the former works out at about £180 per house. The latter can be bought I understand for about £170, freehold. Factory and Workshops Act, 1901. Every Workshop and Work place, including the houses in which out door workers reside, has been inspected with reference to (a) Cleanliness. (b) Air space. (The cubic air space has been measured in every case, and the number of workpeople regulated with respect thereto. (c) Ventilation. (d) Drainage of floois. (e) Sanitary conveniences with respect to workshops only. (Factories are dealt with by the Surveyor under sec. 22 of the Public Health Amendment Act, 1890). In every case the above conditions have been complied with A register is kept as to these requirements. A register is kept of home workers who live in the district but work for persons in other districts. 14 have been notified. There 24 are no outworkers employed by persons in the district who reside in other districts. Every house in which outworkers reside is inspected and every possible precaution taken in the event of infectious disease breaking out. Five notices have been served in regard to workshops under the Public Health Act. Factories, Workshops, Laundries, Workplaces and Homework. I.—INSPECTION.

I have inspected these at intervals, and always investigated any outbreak of infectious disease which has broken out. Diphtheria, Measles, and Chicken Pox, have been epidemic, but, by promptly isolating those affected, from the healthy, in no case has the number of cases largely increased, and the epidemic has always quickly subsided. With regard to Measles, I still continue to allow children in the upper standards to attend school, though perhaps one of the younger children may be at home suffering from the complaint, provided that the patient is kept isolated from the rest. I have not traced a single case of disease from this arrangement. I am of opinion that as a rule the diphtheria cases were due to contagion at school, probably from unrecognised mild attacks. In one instance, I was asked to see a child in school who appeared 26 a little poorly and found large well marked patches of diphtheria membrane on the tonsils. I regard all cases of "Sore throat" as being suspicious, and do all in my power to isolate them as long as possible, especially where I am not able to obtain a throat swabbing. The general attendance during the year has been an average one, the actual figure being 87.1 per cent. Part II. 29 Action Taken to Prevent the Spread of Infectious Disease. 1. House visited by Sanitary Officials as soon as practicable after the receipt of notification. 2. Isolation of patients, or removal to Infectious Diseases Hospital. 3. Bedding, &c. disinfected by steam. (Washington Lyon's patent), wherever necessary, or in certain cases, burnt. 4. Rooms fumigated with Formic Aldehyde. 5. Disinfectants supplied gratis. 6. Houses examined with a view of detecting defects in age, or any other sanitary imperfections. 7. Printed instructions circulated, and verbal instructions given. 8. Whitewashing, re-papering, and cleansing of premises ever considered necessary. 9. Notice at once sent to the Head Teacher of Day School, the Superintendent of Sunday School at which the patient attends, and School Attendance Officer. 10. Notice sent privately to pawnshops. 30 Infectious Disease. Table shewing the distribution of the various notifiable Infectious diseases in the several Wards of the Town, for the year 1905. Disease.

I find that out of 98 cases of Scarlet Fever, 2 occurred under one year, and 7 over 15 years, the remaining 8 cases occurring between the ages of 1 and 15, in other words, at the age when children are congregated in schools. Again, I find that with respect to Diphtheria 116 cases were notified in all, 100 of which occurred between 1 and 15. Add to these the number of children who contract Measles, Whooping Cough, Chicken Pox, &c., and the outlook is anything but pleasant for the rising generation. To my mind these figures raise a question of primary importance in connection with school attendance, and one which should be earnestly approached by the responsible authority. The following figures give some idea of the extent the infectious disease prevail in this district: Number of cades 1896-1905 Average death rate 1896-1905 Death rate 1905 Case rate per 1000 of estimated pop. for year 1905 Average case rate per 1000 1896-1905. Scarlet Fever 781 .05 0.00 3.5 3.5 Diphtheria 947 .3 .5 4.1 4.2 Enteric Fever 345 — 0.00 .5 1.4 Measles — .5 .5 — — It will be clear from this table that Scarlet Fever and Enteric Fever are very low and have a great tendency to decrease and that Diphtheria and Measles remain about stationary, perhaps in the case of the former shewing some tendency to increase both in numberand fatality. Scarlet Fever. There has not been anything approaching to an epidemic of this disease daring the year. The number of cases has been about the average in proportion to the population, which has attained in this district during the past ten years. There were no deaths during the year, though several cases were very severe. 32 The following table shews the number of cases and deaths during the past 5 years: No. of Cases No. treated in Hospital Percentage treated in Hospital Deaths Death Rate per 1,000 of population 1905 98 77 78.5 0 0.00 1904 94 71 75 3 .1 1903 70 57 81 1 .04 1902 96 82 85 0 .00 1901 134 92 68 3 .13 1900 67 51 76 1 .04 It is a remarkable fact that during the ten years, 1896-1905, only 12 deaths have occurred from this disease in the Barking district. Diphtheria. Cases kept cropping up all through the year with occasional small epidemics. In the early part of the year, Rippleside and the Castle School were chiefly affected and although the cases were mostly severe, they all recovered except one child, under 12 months old. Taking the cases all through the year, I am bound to admit that they have been of exceptional severity, and also that the results from Anti-toxin injection did not give such satisfaction as in former years. This may be due to a larger proportion than usual of late cases or possibly the serum was less potent. Whichever factor was the true cause, the death rate was higher than it has been since 1896, when it stood at 12.5 per cent. The death rate per 1,000 of the population shews an increase on that of the year 1904, but is not so high as 1903. As I have mentioned elsewhere in the report, I have discovered one case this year, attending school and suffering from the disease, but nnfortunately for the theory that it is by means of these cases that the disease is spread, no other case occurred in that particular class or school. The whole question seems to me at the moment extremely difficult of solution. 33 As to Diphtheria, Anti-toxin as a prophylactic, my experience has been a little unlucky. I gave 2000 units and in fourteen days the child was in hospital with a severe and usual Diphtheritic attack. In other cases, however, no such result has occurred and I can only trace half-a-dozen cases in which it has been done in the district. In every case a searching enquiry has been made into the circumstances attending the outbreak of the disease, with the following results : Cases occurring during 1905 in new houses built during the past 5 years. 31 Number of cases in which the water was not derived from the main, but 29 from a cistern. from wells 2 Number of different milk supplies Condensed milk (different brands 48 different Milksellers 23 Number of houses in which Sani tary defects were found. 30 1 case of overcrowding. It is very remarkable how often it is that cases of Diphtheria crop up in new streets. Practically 30 per cent. last year came under this heading. Almost the same percentage derived their water from a storage cistern. I examined the water from those cistern in many cases, but never found it appreciably contaminated. With regard to milk supply, the cases presented no relation to any particular supply or description of milk, but were distributed about fairly amongst all the milk sellers of the district, including the condensed milk retailers. Sanitary defects were looked for in every case and discovered in 20 ; and one case of rather bad overcrowding was dealt with. 34 I append the following table for comparison with former years:— No. of Cases Deaths No. treated in Hospital Percentage treated in Hospital Death Rate per per cent Death Rate 1,000 of population 1905 116 14 91 78.4 12.0 .5 1904 145 9 113 77 6.2 .33 1903 194 19 149 76.8 9.7 0.76 1902 75 6 20 28.0 8.0 0.25 1901 80 3 41 51.2 3.7 0.13 1900 75 5 33 44.4 6.5 0.23 1899 49 4 14 28.5 8.1 0.18 1898 74 7 39 52.7 9.4 0.35 1897 91 9 33 36 9.1 0.5 1896 48 6 39 52 12.5 0.36 Enteric Fever. For the first time for many years I have to record the fact that no death from Enteric Fever occurred during the year. One case is registered who died during the last week in December, 1904, and therefor must [appear in the official figures. Fourteen cases have been notified. In two, a history of having partaken of shell fish about fourteen days before the attack was clearly stated. In one, the fish were collected from a portion of the foreshore in the Thames estuary and eaten immediately without cooking. In no case could I find any faultwith food, water or milk supply, except in two cases there was a storage cistern slightly contaminated. I append the usual table for comparison with former years:— No. of Cases Deaths No. treated in Hospital Percentage treated in Hospital Death Rate per cent Death Rate per 1,000 of population 1905 14 0 9 64.2 0 .00 1904 18 5 12 65 27 .18 1903 16 4 7 43.7 25.0 .16 1902 42 6 30 71 14.2 ... 1901 68 3 35 51 4.4 ... 1900 50 7 38 76 14.0 ... 1899 52 3 33 63.4 5.7 ... 1898 31 2 23 74.1 6.2 ... 35 Diarrhœa. There have been 22 deaths from diarrhoea in children under one year. The death rate per 1,000 from epidemic diarrhoea for estimated population for 1905 was 1.5. The food upon which infants under one year were fed respectively, is as follows:— 1. Fed on breast milk up to 5 months and then quaker oats and cows milk. House clean; no sanitary defects. 2. Only nursed on breast milk. No sanitary defects. 3. Only nursed on breast milk. No sanitary defects. 4. Only nursed on breast milk. No sanitary defects. 5. Nursed by mother for 6 months, then fed on cows milk and barley water. No sanitary defects. 6. Nursed by mother for 4 months, then artificial food and Nestle's milk. 7. Nursed by mother for 4 months, then cows milk and barley water. No sanitary defects. 8. Nursed by mother 4 months. Milk and barley water. 9. Artificial food and barley water.

That is, in about 11 per cent. of the fatal cases, there is no history of the child having been fed on any artificial food whatever. The rest of the cases are simple. Cow's milk and barley water or condensed milk and barley water being the usual diet. From the annexed table it will be seen that the death rate has remained much the same during the past 3 years. The average death rate for the 10 years 1895-1905 is 1.8. Year Est. Population.

The number of deaths registered from this disease during the year was 22, which is equal to an annual death rate of .78 of the estimated population. The number of other Tubercular diseases was 9, making a total for all Tubercular diseases of 31. Therefore the rate for all Tubercular diseases works out at 1.1 per 1,000 of the estimated population. These rates are very satisfactory. 38 The question of dealing systematically with the disease is now under the consideration of the Public Health Committee. Hitherto no action of any kind has been taken in the way of prevention. I append a list shewing the progress of the disease in the disrict during the past 10 vears. No. of deaths.

All occurred under 5 years of age, and 5 under 1 year. The average death-rate per 1,000 of the estimated population for the 10 years 1896-1905 amounts to .5. No schools were closed during the year on account of this disease. The death-rate for the year 1905 was .5 per 1,000. Whooping Cough. Four deaths only took place during the year from this disease against 17 last year. The death rate per 1,000 of the estimated population was .14. 39 Erysipelas. Two cases of death from this disease has been registered during the year. The number of cases during the past five years may be seen from the annexed table. In all cases disinfection of bedding etc., is enforced, and enquiries instituted as to whether any puerperal case is implicated. Cases. Deaths. 1905 27 2 1904 23 1 1903 28 o 1902 26 o 1901 16 3 1900 16 o Typhus Fever. No case of this disease occurred during the past year. Puerperal Fever. Two cases have been notified from this disease daring the year with no death. In no case was there any spread of the disease. The premises were examined in each case for sanitary defects with negative result. The rooms and bedding were disinfected, and the Nurse attending prohibited from nursing other cases until after disinfection. Death rate per 1000=0.00. „ „ 1903=00.4. Cases.

These results seem to me most satisfactory, and reflect a good deal of credit on the Doctors and Nurses engaged in Midwifery in the town. Further Sanitary Requirements of District. 1. Much still remains to be done in the re-laying and ventilation of drains and sewers in many parts of the town, in rendering many houses more habitable by paving round them (see "Inspection of District"). 2. More ventilation to the public sewers. 3. Sanitary tenements at lower rentals for the poorest labouring class. 4. Fresh water supply for Creeksmouth, and other parts of District not yet connected with public supply. 5. Public Sanitary Conveniences for both sexes (especially for women) are greatly needed in several parts of the town. 6. An improved method of dealing with the sludge at the Sewerage Works. 7. Nursine Home and administration block at Hospital, and new method of sewage disposal. 8. Under this heading I wish again to draw attention to the serious nuisance which has been caused during the past year by the abominable smells emanating from the Sewage Works of the Ilford Council situate in the Watery Lane close to the northern boundary of the Barking District. In every possible way the Barking Council sought to impress upon the authorities at Ilford that this matter had become one of the greatest importance to the district under their care, and that some means would have to be adopted to remedy the intolerable nuisance that had arisen. 41 As a result of the representations that have been made by the Barking Council to the Local Government Board on the subject' the Ilford Council have stated that works are in progress which it is anticipated will remove the cause of complaint. This, however, still remains to be seen. Rainfall. 1905 20.51 inches 1904 18.29 „ 1903 33.25 ,, 1902 19.08 „ Observer: Mr. T. Booton. Small Pox. One case of Small Pox was notified. This case was probably due to contact with contacts from a troopship on which cases of Small Pox had occurred. The patient was isolated at the Dagenham Hospital and recovered. Vaccination. The total number of Primary Vaccinations which have been performed during the past four years is as follows:— No. of Primary Vaccinations. f Births. 1905 761 900 1904 769 896 1903 907 856 1902 1034 817 Pauperism during 1905. There has been an abnormal amount of destitution during the year as is shown by the amount distributed by Medical and temporary relief. I have no doubt that the poverty and destitution which has taken place have added considerably to the Mortality and Sickness returns of the district. 42 Vital Statistics. The Death Rate. The Death Rate for the year 1905 after all corrections, works out at 13.5 per 1,000 of the estimated population, which is the lowest nett death rate for which I have any record. The average rate for deaths registered in the district for the ten years 1895-1904 is 16.3, and the Average Net Rate for the five years 1901-5 14.8. The extra deaths of persons belonging to the district but dying in institutions beyond the district amounted in 1905 to 42, or an addition to the Death Rate of 1.5 per 1,000. The total number of deaths was 337, which are divisible into the following age periods:— Under 1 year 128 One year and under 5 years 58 Total under 5 years 186 Five years and under 15 22 Fifteen years and under 25 19 Twenty-five „65 95 Over 65 years 57 379 From these figures it will be seen that nearly 50 per cent. of the deaths occur under 5 years of age (49 per cent.). This is a very large proportion, and it should be the earnest endeavour of the Public Health Authority to lower this proportion. Of the deaths under 1 year, 142 per 1,000 births registered during the year died. This also in my opinion is most unsatisfactory, though by eliminating 18 due to Premature Birth, the rate is lowered to 122. I don't see that Premature Births are exactly due to insanitary conditions. 43 The death of infants arising from wasting diseases numbered 25, and the deaths from the kindred diseases of Diarrhoea and Enteritis were 39, making a total of 64. I think these figures shew pretty clearly the direction in which any effort to lower the Death Hate should be directed. I append the usual table shewing the chief causation of the Child mortality:— 1905. 1904. 1. Diarrhœa 43 41 2. Whooping Cough 4 17 3. Measles 14 21 4. Bronchitis 12 19 5. Bronco Pneumonia 17 29 6. Diphtheria 14 6 94 133 The deaths during the active period of life, viz: 25-65 numbered 95, or a proportion of 24 per cent. to the whole. Over 65 accounted for 57, or a percentage to the whole of 15. infantile Mortality. Rate per 1,000 births registered:— Year. Barking. Ilford.

The rate for 1895-6 was 43.3 and it has been steadily declining ever since. The number of births during the year was 900, 443 boys, 457 girls. The number of illegitimate births during the same period was 25. Zymotic Death Rate.

Marriages solemnized at the Parish Church 115 At the Noncomformist Churches and Register Office 27 Total 142 45 Isolation Hospital. The total number of Infectious cases removed to Hospital during the year from the Barking district was 179, viz.— Small Pox 1 treated at Dagenham. Diphtheria 91 Membranous Croup 1 Scarlet Fever 77 Enteric Fever 9 179 In addition to these there were 8 cases of Scarlet Fever admitted into Upney Hospital from outside districts. This makes a total of 180 cases treated at Upney. The remainder were treated in one or another of the London Hospitals. The Diphtheria cases were for the most part severe, and the death rate was higher than usual. I have divided the cases as accurately as possible into severe, moderate and mild. Severe 33 Moderate 35 Mild 15 83 It is important to note that the earlier the case came under treatment the more chance it had to recover. Of those admitted on the first day of the disease, which only, numbered 4, all recovered. Out of 45 admitted on the second day there were again no deaths; but of those admitted on the third day, numbering 21, 6 died, and on the fourth day, 3. One case, which was not infected, also died. All cases, except one, were injected with Diphtheria Anti-toxin. The death rate per cent of the 46 cases under treatment was 13, and the number of cases of marked paralysis, not including those which died of Cardiac Failure was 15. With regard to Scarlet Fever, 80 cases were under treatment without any deaths to record. Of Enteric Fever I have only to say that the cases admitted were few, and though severe, they all recovered. The Nursing Staff now consists of Matron and Staff Nurse, with three Assistant Nurses and three Probationers. There are also three Ward Maids, Cook, and Laundry Maid. The average number of days each patient remained in Hospital was 66, and the average cost per diem, including maintenance and establishment charge, was about 2/6, representing a charge on the General District Rate of 2¾ in the pound for the year. I fear it will be impossible to go through another winter without further means of heating, at the Upper Hospital. Whether this had best be done by means of hot water radiators or by extra stoves, is a matter of consideration, preferably the former. A suitable supply of hot water in the bath rooms and lavatories at the Upper Hospital is urgently required. The fencing around the Hospital Grounds has been extended and improved, but the open iron fencing abutting on the Public footpath remains until the deviation agreed to by Quarter Sessions is carried into effect by the owners of the adjoining estate. The arrangements in case of fire have received a large amount of consideration, and when carried into effect will, I feel sure, prove sufficient. The Hospital is not a large one: containing space for 32 adult beds. Scarlet Fever, 12 beds; Diphtheria, 12 beds; Enteric Fever, 8 beds, with disinfecting rooms, &c. During the best part of the year the Enteric Wards have been utilized for Diphtheria, with the result that but one case of the disease has been refused admission. 47 I am decidedly of opinion that it would have been impossible to successfully cope with the various outbreaks of Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever had there not been any provision for isolation in Hospital. A large amount of useful Sanitary work has been done in the Public Health Department during the year, for the details of which I beg to refer to the report of the Sanitary Inspector, which is attached to the foot. The table required by the Local Government Hoard will also be found appended. In concluding my Report for another year I desire to express my indebtedness both to the Staff at the Hospital. and to the Sanitary Staff for their able and willing assistance at all times. I am, Gentlemen, Your Obedient Servant, C. F. FFNTON. 48 Vital Statistics of whole District during 1005 and previous years. Year. Population estimated to Middle of each Year. Births.

Deaths from all Causes at all ages 379 Population, estimated to middle of 1905, 28,000 Report of the Sanitary Inspector, PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. To the Chairman and Members of the Barking Town Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you my Annual Report dealing with the Sanitary work carried out during the year 1905. Inspections. The total number of Inspections made during the year was 1,870, these include house to house inspections, houses in which Infectious Disease occurred, houses which have been subject of complaint, workshops, etc., and miscellaneous inspections. In no less than 1,157 of the houses inspected, Sanitary defects were discovered, necessitating the service of notice, and which are included in the following figures:— For abatement of various nuisances, 654 preliminary and 115 statutory notices were served, but in no case was legal proceedings necessary; in a large number of instances defects were remedied (without serving any notices) after personal interview with the owners concerned. 54 It will be observed that the number of house to house inspections made during the past twelve months is less than in previous years. This decrease is principally to be accounted for by(1), the work of preparing the wages book by the Assistant Inspector for some months during the year; and (2), the increasing clerical work of the department which now takes up a far greater amount of time on the part of the Assistant Inspector and myself than heretofore, and necessarily reduces the hours to be devoted to outside work, to which although obviously so important, it has not been possible to give the attention it demands. Complaints. During the year 107 complaints were received with reference to alleged existence of nuisances. Each complaint was entered in the register and the premises immediately inspected, and where a nuisance was found that could be dealt with under the Public Health Acts, the necessary steps were taken to remedy or abate the nuisance. House Drainage. The number of drains tested with smoke or chemicals during the year was 165, and 101 were found to be defective; the greater number of these defects were found upon opening up for examination to be due to the pipes not being jointed, and to the water closet or gully trap not properly connected with the drain. All reconstruction work is now carefully examined and tested before being covered in. In six instances the main drain was found in a defective condition. They were reported to the Public Health Committee, and instructions given by them to the Surveyor's Department to carry out the necessary work under Section 41 of the Public Health Act. 55 The main drain at the rear of premises have been found choked in 44 instances, and as these are combined drains which under existing law are deemed to be sewers, they have been reported to the Surveyor's Department and immediately cleared by the Council's workmen. Infectious Disease. The number of cases notified during the year was 260, and in every case the premises were immediately visited, and examination was made of the drains and sanitary fittings, and when any defects were found a notice was served upon the responsible person. Enquiries are made as to the possible source of infection, to the milk supply, and schools attended, etc., etc., and full particulars are entered in the Infectious Disease Register. Where patients are nursed at home a printed form of precautions to be observed is handed to the householder, and directions given as to isolation, &c. As soon as possible after a patient is removed to Hospital or recovery of patient when treated at home, the room is fumigated with formic aldehyde vapour, and sealed up at least five hours, and the bedding, etc., removed to the disinfecting apparatus, 226 rooms have been fumigated, 281 lots of bedding, clothing, etc , disinfected, and 57 rooms stripped, stopped and ceilings limewashed, after cases of Scarlet Fever. The Head Teachers' of Day Schools, Superintendent of Sunday Schools, and the School Attendance Officer, are advised of all cases of infectious disease occurring at houses in which scholars reside who are attending' school. Pawnbrokers are also notified of all cases. 56 Common Lodging Houses. There are five registered houses in the district as follows:— No. of Rooms.

Mortuary, During the year 37 bodies were received into the Mortuary, viz., 21 males, and 16 females; 31 for the purposes of inquests, and and 6 on sanitary grounds. Post mortem examinations were made in six cases. Petroleum. Five Licences have been renewed; and one new one sanctioned. All have* been periodically visited to see that the conditions of the Petroleum Act are properly carried out. Sale of Food and Drugs Act. The number of samples purchased for the purposes of Analysis by the County Analyst was as follows:— Butter 35 Milk 20 Coffee 2 Margarine 2 59 57 Of the 59 samples purchased, the following were found to be not of the nature, substance, and quality demanded.

No notice has been received this year from H.M. Inspector of Factories. Gipsies' Vans and Tents. Again we have had considerable trouble with these people during the past year; as many as 104 vans have been removed off vacant building land. The inmates throw their refuse on the ground around the vans and cause considerable annoyance to the occupiers of houses in the localityw here they camp. Some of the owners have fenced in their land, but there are several places where the land is unfenced and no assistance is rendered us in keeping the Gipsies off. I have again to thank the police officers for their assistance in removing these vans. Dairies, Cowsheds and Slaughter Houses. There are 27 Milkshops, 5 Cowsheds, 1 Licensed and 3 Registered Slaughtei Houses in the District, all of which have been periodically inspected, and the limewhiting done in accordance with the Bye-laws. 59 Inspection of Meat and other Foods. The various Butchers Shops, Greengrocers Shops, and other places where food is sold, have been frequently inspected. A number of articles of food were destroyed at the request of the owners. In conclusion, I append Summary of Work carried out. I am, Gentlemen, Your Obedient Servant, H. WOOD, Sanitary Inspector. 60 Summary of Nuisances Detected and Work done during the Year 1905.
