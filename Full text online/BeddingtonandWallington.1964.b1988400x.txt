Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the report for 1964 on the health of the people of the former Borough of Beddington and Wallington, now a part of your new London Borough of Sutton. This is the twenty-eighth and last report in the seri.es commenced by me in 1937. I feel it is a very great honour to have served the Borough as Medical Officer of Health during the whole course of its existence and now, as Associate Medical Officer of Health of the new London Borough, to be enabled to continue to serve the community to which I have been so long attached. The report has been drawn up in accordance with Ministry of Health Circular 1/1965 The Registrar General's estimate of the population of Beddington and Wallington at mid-year 1964 is 32,590 and this figure is used in the compilation of the vital statistics. The figure shows an increase of 30 compared with the Registrar General's estimate for mid-year 1963. The census of population taken in 1961 was 32,588. The live birth rate per 1,000 total population shows a slight increase at 15.65 in 1964 as compared with 15.47 in 1963 This rate is below that for England and Wales, which is 18.40. The stillbirth rate per 1,000 total births is 10.57 compared with 8.56 in 1963. The figure for England and Wales is recorded as 16.40. The number of children stillborn in the district was 5 out of a total of 473 births. The death rate from all causes per 1,000 total population is 9.76 compared with 10.51 in 1963 and 11,30 for England and Wales. Of the 335 deaths, diseases of the heart accounted for 108 (32.24 of total deaths) cancer 73 (21.79 per cent of total deaths). There was one death from tuberculosis, As has been reported in previous years, heart disease and other diseases of the circulatory system and vascular lesions of the nervous system (stroke) accounted for a great proportion of the deaths. The table on Page 8 gives the number of deaths from these various causes. It will be seen that the pattern is very comparable with what has taken place in previous years. The number of deaths from cancer of the lung was 19, showing an increase of one on the previous year. The total number of deaths from cancer was 73# No mothers died in childbirth during 1964, and this gives a maternal mortality rate per 1,000 total births of nil, as compared with 0.25 for England and Wales. The infantile mortality rate shows a decrease at 17.09 per 1,000 live births, as compared with 17.32 in 1963. Eight infants died under the age of one year in 1964 out of 468 live births. The corresponding rate for England and Wales is 20*00. The incidence of infectious disease generally throughout 1964 has been low. Out of a total of 153 notifications of infectious diseases, measles accounted for 116. 3. Nine cases of scarlet fever and 12 cases of whooping cough were notified. It is felt that the attention of parents should again be drawn to the need for immunisation against whooping cough. The immunising material used throughout the year against diphtheria, contained immunising material against whooping cough and tetanus. It is again pleasing to record that during the year no cases of poliomyelitis occurred in the Borough. This is the sixth year in succession in which we have been able to make this comment. Poliomyelitis immunisation was vigorously pursued throughout the year and we estimate that of children below the age of l6 years 80% have been immunised. On page 21 will be found a report on the establishment of smoke control areas in the Borough. This is the fifth smoke control area for which an order has been made, which will come into operation on 10th October, 1965. I would like to place on record my appreciation of the loyal service and valuable assistance which I have received from all members of my staff throughout the year and throughout all the previous years for which I have been responsible as Medical Officer of Health for the health of Beddington and Wallington. In particular I would wish to mention the very valuable service and loyal support I have always received from Mr. R. F. Burns, Chief Clerk of the Department since 1938. Mr. Cripps has been Chief Public Health Inspector since 1953 when Mr. Lennard retired. During the lifetime of the Borough there have only been two Chief Public Health Inspectors and the very high standard of their work has ensured a healthy and well organised community. I have the honour to be, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, PATRICK J. 0!C0NNELL Medical Officer of Health. Health & Welfare Department, Town Hall, Wallington.

STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (in acres) 3,048 Population, census, 1931 26,249 Population, census, 1961 32,588 Registrar-General's estimate of resident population for 1964 32,590 Number of inhabited houses, 1931 7,092 Number of inhabited houses, 1964 10,344 Rateable Value £2,279,796 Sum represented by penny rate £9,400 The Urban District of Beddington and Wallington was constituted in 1915 by an Order of the Surrey County Council, the area up to that time being part of the Croydon Rural District, By an Order in Council, dated 20th August, 1937, H. M. King George VI granted a charter to Beddington and Wallington, which was presented on the 15th September, 1937, by the Lord Lieutenant of the County of Surrey. The Borough is bounded on the east by the County Borough of Croydon, to the north by the Borough of Mitcham, to the v/est by the Carshalton Urban District, and to the south by the Urban District of Coulsdon and Purley. By the London Government Act of 1963, under which there are established new administrative areas to be known as London Boroughs, Beddington and Wallington will cease as and from the 1st April, 1965 to be a separate unit of local government administration. From that date it will be joined up with the former Urban District of Carshalton and the Municipal Borough of Sutton and Cheam, to form the new London Borough of Sutton. During the 28 years of existence, the Borough has shown very considerable development. The mainly residential character has been maintained and expanded, mostly in the southern part. The centre of the town in recent years, however, has shown a newer type of residential development with the introduction of blocks of flats. Reorganised shop centres are under construction and there has also been an expansion of office accommodation. While the town can be described as in part a London dormitory, there is much more employment available locally. Factories in the Borough provide employment for some 10,000 people, these being situated mostly in the northern part of the Borough. New development is contemplated on the site of the former Croydon Aerodrome. A very comprehensive plan has been approved and it is hoped in a few years to see a completely developed new area comprising houses, schools, shops and offices. This site has an area of 407 acres, and it is proposed to house 5,230 persons, the total number of houses being 1,848. Parks and open spaces continue to be well maintained, and give breathing space and facilities fc-r open-air recreational activities. Beddington Park and Grange Park are used as much as ever, and are an estimable boon during the holiday months to children and parents, who are unable to go away for a holiday. The pleasing residential character of the district is well maintained and is much appreciated by many City workers, who return home to pleasant relaxation in their gardens and allotments in the evenings. 5.

The comparable rate for England and Wales is 20.00. Great credit is due to the services operated in the Borough for the care of mothers and young children. Of the total of 468 live births, only 8 deaths of infants under one year of age (4 males and 4 females) were registered. 8. PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA PERSONAL HEALTH The Surrey County Council, the Local Health Authority under the National Health Services Act, 1946 were responsible for the provision of the following domiciliary and personal health services* The Medical Officer of Health in his capacity of Divisional Medical Officer, administered these services in the Borough on behalf of the County Council. Midwifery and Home Nursing Domestic Help Services Chiropody for expectant mothers, the elderly and handicapped Care of Mothers and Young Children Health Visiting Iiruunisation and Vaccination School Health Service. LABORATORY FACILITIES The Corporation's arrangements for the examination of swabs, sputa and other pathological material continue as heretofore. During 1964, H. Amphlett Williams, Esq., Ph.D.(Lond.), A.C.G.F.C,, F.R.I.C., Public Analyst, City of London Laboratories, King's Head Yard, Borough High Street, London, S.E.1., continued the arrangements made in 1946 for the examination of milk, water and ice-cream. In general, pathological specimens, are sent to the Pathological Laboratories at St. Helier Hospital. Samples of milk and water are submitted for bacteriological examination to the Ministry of Health laboratories at Epsom, reports being received free of charge under the National Health Service Act, 1946. HOSPITALS Infectious Cases: The South-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board make provision for the admission and treatment of cases of infectious disease in hospitals under their control. Most of the cases from Beddington and Wallington continue to be admitted to the Wandle Valley Isolation Hospital Smallpox: The Regional Hospital Board have made arrangements for the admission of cases of smallpox to their hospital at Joyce Green, Dartford. Venereal Diseases Clinics The Surrey County Council was, until the 5th July, 1948, responsible for the control and treatment of venereal diseases in the area, and was a member of the London and Home Counties Scheme. This service was taken over on the 5th July, 1948, by the Regional Hospital Board, who continue to provide free diagnosis and treatment at the Croydon General Hospital, at clinics established at St. Helier Hospital, the Royal Surrey Hospital, Guildford, the East Surrey Hospital, Redhill, and at hospitals previously under the London and Home Counties Scheme. General and Accident Cases. Cases from this area are admitted to: Carshalton, Beddington and Wallington District (War Memorial) Hospital. St. Helier Hospital, Carshalton. Croydon General Hospital. The Wilson Hospital, Miteham 9. Maternity Cases. The Regional Hospital Board continue the provision at St, Helier Hospital for maternity cases in the Borough requiring institutional confinements. Some patients continue to be admitted to the Carshalton, Beddington and Wallington ("War Memorial) Hospital under arrangements made by their practitioners under the National Health Service Act, 1946. AMBULANCE FACILITIES General and Accident Cases. Reorganisation of the ambulance services was undertaken by the Surrey County Council on their transfer on 5th July, 19^8. The main ambulance station is situated at 163 Kingston Road, New Maiden. All ambulances are equipped with short wave radio communication, and are readily available for direction in case of emergency. DISINFECTION The disinfection of houses has been undertaken by the Council during the year and the Wandle Valley Hospital has continued to co-operate in the disinfection of bedding. Disinfection which is not absolutely essential in the interests of the public health is also undertaken upon a payment of £1 per load for bedding, etc., and 7s.6d. for the first room and 3s.9d. for each additional room as applied to house disinfection. CLEANSING OF PERSONS During the year the Corporation continued to provide facilities for cleansing infested persons. HOUSING HOUSING ACT, 1957 Seventy-one houses were rendered fit as a result of informal or statutory action under the Public Health Act, 1936 and Housing Act, 1957. Number of inspections of dwelling-houses 139 Number of inspections recorded under Housing Regulations 9 In the absence of a complete survey of the Borough, it is impossible to give accurate figures relating to the number of cases of overcrowding. Evidence available indicates that the number is low. The table below sets out information concerning cases of overcrowding which have come to the knowledge of the Health Department. Number of dwellings overcrowded at the end of the year 4 Number of families dwelling therein 5 Number of persons dwelling therein 30 Number of new cases of overcrowding reported 4 Number of cases of overcrowding relieved 4 Number of persons concerned 24 Number of dwelling houses in respect of which the Local Authority have taken steps for the abatement of overcrowding and which Nil RENT ACT, 1957 One application for Certificate of Disrepair was received. One notice of intention to issue Certificate of Disrepair was sent out. 10. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA WATER SUPPLIES The water supply is piped throughout the district from the Sutton District Water Company. All dwelling-houses in the area are connected to public water mains. None of the inhabitants rely upon stand pipes. During the year the supply has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity. It is understood that the Water Company carry out routine bacteriological examinations of the raw and finished water daily from the wells at Sutton and Woodmansterne, and also of the treated water going into supply. Routine chemical examinations are also carried out. The raw water from the deep wells is of a relatively high degree of hardness. The company are under a statutory obligation (Sutton District Waterworks Act, 1903) to deliver water of not more than 9 degrees of hardness, and an elaborate softening plant is in use. During the year 32 samples of water were examined by the Public Analyst or the Public Health Laboratory Service. From the reports the water supply is shov/n to be satisfactory both in chemical and bacteriological purity, and no cases of illness associated with pollution of water supplies were recorded during the year. The chlorination of water from private wells situated in industrial premises was continued throughout the year. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE The arrangements for sewerage and sewage disposal continue to be adequate for immediate needs. Investigations in association with Croydon were continued throughout the year for some diversion of sewage in the Beddington area and also to drain the place of the proposed development on Croydon Airport. No major difficulty arose during the year in connection with the maintenance and cleansing of soil and storm water systems. RIVERS AND STREAMS The work carried out in 1963 as part of the River Wandle Improvement Scheme undertaken by the Surrey County Council proved to be of very considerable value. Agreement was reached between Surrey County Council and the Borough on the scheme to by-pass the culverts in the wall of the Carew Manor. The river will now pass round these culverts and it is hoped will prevent the flooding which has been a feature of the storms in the last few years. CLOSET ACCOMMODATION Practically the whole of the area is on the water carriage system, draining into public sewers. There are a few chemical and earth closets, chiefly for use on sports grounds within the district, whilst four cess-pools were in use in the district at the end of the year. PUBLIC CLEANSING The new mechanical sweepers mentioned in previous reports have proved successful and together with some hand sweeping the Borough was maintained in a cleanly state during the whole year. Refuse collection, using paper bags instead of dustbins, was extended to cover the whole Borough and by the end of the year the scheme was complete. 11. SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA The following statement by the Chief Public Health Inspector gives statistics as to the number of complaints received, inspections made, defects remedied, and other work carried out by the Public Health Inspectors.

SWIMMING BATH During the year under review the swimming bath at the Carew Manor School was maintained by the local Education Authority for the use of school-children exclusively. The water supply for the Swimming Bath is drawn from a well sunk in the grounds of the institution, After filling up, the water is only topped up, and complete emptying of the bath does not take place during the whole of the season. Chlorination is by means of a chlorine gas injector; the standard of chlorination maintained is 0.7 parts per million in the shallow end, and 0.4 parts per million in the middle of the bath. Filtration is carried out by pressure through a sand filter. Samples of the swimming bath water submitted for bacteriological examination throughout the season, were returned as bacteriologically satisfactory. SCHOOLS School Closure. Infectious diseases common to childhood were not prevalent in epidemic form in any of the schools during the year. As a result it was not found necessary for any school to be closed by the local sanitary authority to prevent the spread of infectious disease. Medical Inspection. Under the 1944 Education Act the Assistant Medical Officers of the County Council continued to carry out routine and special medical inspections of schoolchildren in the maintained schools. This work is under the general supervision cf the Medical Officer of Health, in his capacity of Divisional School Medical Officer for the Mid-Eastern Divisional Executive of the Surrey County Council. Water Supply and Sanitary Conditions. All the schools are supplied with water from the public mains and are connected with the sewers. During the year further progress was made in bringing the maintained schools up to pre-war standards of decoration. No major sanitary defects were found. Considerable thought has been given to the maintenance of good standards of hygiene in school canteens. The serving of meals on a large scale in establishments such as schools, represents a danger-point for the occurrence of food poisoning. The maintenance of high standards of hygiene and sanitation is dependent upon the intelligent co-operation of every individual member of a canteen staff. The Ministries of Health and Education are constantly devising methods of educating staff to realise the importance of a high standard of personal hygiene, in order to avoid outbreaks of food poisoning. In order to further the interests of hygiene, and encourage washing after the use of the toilet, all Infants' schools in the Mid-Eastern Division have now been provided with a constant hot water supply to the taps supplying the wash basins in the school cloak rooms. 26. OUTBREAKS OF FOOD POISONING, AND CLEAN FOOD CAMPAIGN During the year no outbreaks of food poisoning occurred* There were, however, two isolated instances relating to one or more members of individual families. Case 1: In this case a husband and wife complained of illness following the consumption of corned beef sandwiches, the sandwiches having been bought ready made. Samples of the material consumed were available for examination but the bacteriologist reported no bacterial growth. Investigations did not bring to light the cause of the illness and the patients recovered spontaneously in a short time. Case 2: This also concerned a husband and wife living alone. The patients complained of abdominal pain, nausea, salivation and vomiting and acute diarrhoea* This came on in the late evening and early hours of the morning and there was a fair degree of prostration. On enquiry it was found that boiled bacon had been consumed about 4 o'clock in the afternoon on the day in which the illness had occurred. The bacon had been boiled some days previously at home and was served cold* It had been in and out of the domestic refrigerator. The bacon plus some other articles of diet were submitted to the bacteriologist in the Public Health Laboratories at Epsom, and the bacon yielded a heavy growth of Staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive. The patients made an uninterrupted recovery and no other article of diet was implicated. NUTRITION The nutritional standards of school children, as observed at routine examinations, and children below school age, as observed at infant welfare centres, are maintained at a very high level, the general impression gained being that children tend to be taller and heavier in the respective age-groups than formerly* The Local Health Authority continued the scheme for the distribution of welfare foods since it was handed over by the Ministry of Food in June, 1954. Local issues were made from an office situated in the Corporation Car Park by the Divisional Medical Officer's staff and ladies of the W.V.S. Issues were also made at infant v/elfare centres and at the branch library in Beddington. Grateful thanks are due to the many volunteers, who so willingly co-operate in this important service for mothers and infants. Proprietary brands of vitamin preparations and some dried milk foods continue to be available to mothers at infant welfare centres and at the Town Hall. SHELL FISH (MOLLUSCAN) Only a small quantity of shell fish is marketed in the district, and is obtained chiefly from Billingsgate Market, London. 27- ADOPTIVE ACTS AND BYE-LAWS The following Acts have been adopted: Public Health Acts (Amendment) Act, 1890, Parts I and III Public Health Acts (Amendment) Act, 1907, Parts I, II, VI & X Private Street Works Act, 1892 Public Health Act, 1925 Public Libraries Acts, 1892-1919 Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, 1899-1925 Bye-laws in respect to the following are in force: Allotment Gardens.
