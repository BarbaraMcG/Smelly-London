Lammas Rights. On the 15th April, 1891, the Solicitor reported that Mr. Justice Kekewich had stayed proceedings in all the actions—other than Harwood v. Fulham Vestry—until the trial of that action, directing that if the decision of the Judge in the first instance be adverse to the Vestry, then they are to submit to judgment without prejudice to their rights of appeal, the Vestry further undertaking in the meantime not to exercise their alleged rights. Wharf in Town Mead and Wandsworth Bridge Road. The Clerk to the Vestry subsequently brought to the notice of the Law and Parliamentary Committee of the Vestry, that certain property in Town Mead and Wandsworth Bridge Roads (forming portion of the land over which the Vestry claims rights of Lammas), was about to be submitted for sale by auction, they instructed the Solicitor to attend the sale and notify, on behalf of the Vestry, that the land is subject to Lammas rights. Metropolitan Asylum Boards Wharf. The Solicitor reported on 26th May, 1891, that the Metropolitan Asylums Board had delivered a statement of claim, claiming an injunction to restrain the Vestry from trespassing or damaging or otherwise interfering with the lands belonging to them, situtated in the parish of Fulham, in the County of Middlesex, and for damage and costs; also that Harwood's Trustee had obtained an order for the Vestry to deliver particulars of lands in Fulham of which they are, or claim to be, possessed, also to file an affidavit stating what documents they have in their possession, custody or power, relating to the matters in question in the action. 16 London County Council's offer to contribute towards costs of action The Parks and Open Spaces Committee of the London County Council, having written to the Vestry stating that they would be prepared to recommend the Council to favourably consider the question of contributing towards the costs incurred by the Vestry in the suits now pending respecting Lammas Rights in Fulham, but prior to any further consideration of the subject, the Committee would be glad to be informed, in detail, of the nature of the suits. The Lammas Rights and Open Spaces Committee of the Vestry referred the letter to the Law and Parliamentry Committee, who instructed the Solicitor to supply the London County Council, in accordance with their request, with particulars of the suits now pending re Lammas Rights. Bishop's and West Meadows. (laying out and embanking of). On the 1st April, 1891, the Clerk was instructed to write to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, stating that the Vestry had carefully considered the offer of the Commissioners to grant the West Meadow on a lease of 999 years, and find that they cannot obtain the sanction of the London County Council to effect a loan or to carry out their covenants, unless the land is given as freehold, and that the Vestry would suggest as a means to enable the London County Council to assent, that they should sell the land to the Vestry for a nominal sum, and that a copy of this resolution, together with a copy of the letter received from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners be forwarded to the London County Council. At the meeting of the Vestry, held on the 29th April, 1891, a letter was read from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, agreeing to convey the West Meadow to the Vestry for a nominal sum, and the Solicitor was instructed to complete the conveyance of the West Meadow from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to the Vestry as soon as possible; and at the same time the Clerk read a letter from the London County Council, stating that as the London County Council had declined to vote the necessary amount for the building of a River Wall, the matter could not be proceeded with unless the Vestry determined to carry out the work. At the meeting of the Vestry, held on the 13th May, 1891, the plans prepared by the Surveyor for the construction of the River Wall and Bishops and West Meadows were approved, and he was instructed to produce at the next meeting of the Works Committee a specification to work to, and an approximate estimate of the costs, and upon the approval of the specification, the Clerk was instructed to issue advertisements for tenders for the work, and to ask the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to allow the Vestry to commence the construction of the River Wall at the West Meadow end, they undertaking to convey the West Meadow to the Vestry upon the completion of the work. The Surveyor having in accordance with the previous resolution prepared the specification for the embankment of the Bishop's and West Meadows, the Works Committee recommended that instead of the wall being a concrete 17 wall with a brick facing, the same be a concrete wall finished in concrete unless the London County Council hereafter require some other material to be used and that the resolution of the Vestry approving the plans be rescinded, so that the whole question may be re-opened with a view to the adoption of the above recommendation. A Deputation waited upon the Improvements Committee of the London County Council, with respect to the contribution by the Council towards the embankment of the Bishop's and West Meadows, and on the 17th of that month, Mr. Weatherley, on behalf of the deputation, reported the result to the Vestry who referred the matter to a special meeting of the Works Committee to formulate a scheme to be laid before the London County Council, which Committee having carefully considered the matter reported to the Vestry on the 26th June, as follows:- Borough of Fulham.—Bishop's and West Meadows. The bishop's meadow consists of 5 acres and 11 perches, with a frontage to the Eiver Thames of 1,440 feet, the rear abutting upon the garden and grounds of the Bishop's Palace. The freehold of this meadow was conveyed to the Fulham District Board, in 1884, by the Bishop of London (Bishop Jackson) and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, the covenant being that the said meadow should be properly fenced, laid out, and planted ; that no building should be erected thereon, but that it should be kept and maintained as an open space for the public. The Fulham Vestry, on the dissolution of the Fulham District Board,became responsible to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for the carrying out of the conditions embodied in the conveyance. The west meadow adjoins the Bishop's Meadow, and consists of 7 acres, with a frontage to the Thames of 350 feet, forming, together with the Bishop's Meadow frontage, an unsurpassable and uninterrupted promenade of 1,700 feet on the River Thames, of inestimable value. This meadow has also an important frontage in Fulham Palace Road of 240 feet, and a further frontage in Bishop's Avenue of 1,465 feet. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners have agreed to convey the freehold of this meadow either to the Fulham Vestry or the London County Council, for a nominal sum, on condition that it be kept as a Public Recreation Ground, and for no other purpose. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners having generously given 12 acres of land for "an open space to the Vestry of Fulham, of the value of, at least, £24,000, there only remains the building of a river wall, and the laying out of the grounds, the cost of which has been estimated by the Vestry's Surveyor at £9,500. The Vestry of Fulham is willing to contribute a moiety and carry out the work, providing the London county Council will contribute the other moiety ; or should the London County Council prefer carrying out the work, either with concrete or granite blocks, the Fulham Vestry will contribute £5,000 towards the cost of same. 18 The Value of Land with a River Frontage at Fulham. In June, 1887, the Fulham Vestry wished to purchase from the Metropolitan Board a plot of land fronting the Thames, consisting of one-third of an acre. The Surveyor to the Board valued it to the Vestry at £2,400, at the rate of £7,000 an acre. After a conference between the two parties, the Metropolitan Board agreed to accept, and was paid £1,500, when a further cost of £1,000 in building a river wall had to be incurred. This plot of land is within 600 yards of the Bishop's meadow. The Total Cost of the Recreation Ground (12½ Acres), with the Embankment and Laying out the Grounds will Cost Less than £1,000 per Acre. If the work of buiding a river wall be not commenced without further delay, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners will withdraw their gift, and the Bishop's and West Meadows, as an open space and river promenade, will be lost to the public. The Vestry, therefore, asks the London County Council to carry out the work at once, the Vestry contributing £5,000 towards the cost, in accordance with the Vestry's resolution of the 26th June, 1891. The Vestry, therefore, respectfully solicits the London County Council to at once consent to this very moderate application,— Population in 1881 42,895, Census Do. 1891 91,640 „ Growth in ten years 48,745. which report was approved and adopted, and a printed copy of the scheme together with a plan of the land, was sent to each member of the London County Council. And on the 29th July, 1891, the Chairman of the Vestry (Mr. Goodacre), informed the V estry that the London County Council had resolved to subscribe £3,500 towards the cost of embanking the Bishop's and West Meadows, and it was resolved—that the matter be referred to the Works Committee. On the 9th September, 1891, a letter was read from the London County Council, stating-that they had, subject to an estimate being submitted to the Finance Committee, decided to contribute £5,000 towards the laying out of the Bishop's Meadow, Fulham, including the building of a River Wall, on condition that the work including the design of the wall was carried out to the satisfaction of the Chief Engineer of the Council within 18 months, and the Vestry accordingly instructed their Surveyor to proceed with the plans and specification forthwith. On the 18th November, 1891, the Vestry sanctioned the engagement of a temporary Draughtsman for one month, at a salary of £2 2s. per week, for the purpose of pressing forward the amended plan of the Bishop's Meadow River Wall. 19 At the meeting of the Vestry, held on the 6th January, 1892, the Surveyor was instructed to have the drawings for the laying out and embanking of the Bishop's and West Meadows completed, and tracings submitted to the London County Council for their approval, with all possible speed, and on the 25th January, 1892, the conditions and specification-were referred to the Solicitor for his consideration. The Surveyor reported to the Vestry on the 3rd February, 1892, that the plans respecting the enbankment of the Bishop's and West Meadows were complete, and they instructed him to have tracings made forthwith, to be forwarded to the London County Council. On the 17th February, 1892, the Vestry resolved that the specification or the construction of the Bishop's Meadow River Wall be approved, subject to revision by the Solicitor and Surveyor, and that 100 copies be printed; and on the same day the following motion by Mr. Goodacre, ceconded by Mr. Lawrence, was carried by the Vestry. River Embankment. 1. That the concrete blocks be 24" by 12" by 12" laid header and stretcher (Flemish Bond). The face of blocks (3" in depth) composed of one part of Portland Cement to two parts Thames Ballast. The remainder to consist of one part Portland cement to five of Thames Ballast. The Ballast to be sitfed through a If" mesh sieve. The blocks as in plan will be more expensive and not so easy to lift and fix as above size. 2. That the cement be stocked one month before using. The blocks made one mouth before being laid, and the concrete remain in the moulds three days. 3. That the coping on top of wall be moulded in situ, apertures left on top of same every 7 feet to fix in the iron standards for the railings. 4. That a double flight of steps be built midway in the embankment (instead of at each end) 6 feet in width to the bottom of the wall, then a causeway of granite setts 9 feet wide, extending to low water. The width of the double flight of steps in the sea-wall at Scarboro' is six feet, and thousands of persons conveniently pass up and down daily. The steps of the embankment at the Temple Steam Boat Piers are built sideways, and eleven feet wide. The plan for the Bishop's Meadow Embankment is made for steps of a width of thirty feet, and a depth of thirty-eight feet, thereby reducing the promenade nearly 300 square yards. The double flight would only require about seventy square yards for their construction. 5. That the gas standards be placed on the inside of kerb of footway (instead of on the coping of wall, as shewn on plan), otherwise half the light will be on the river instead of the embankment. 6. That the iron standards for the railings be heavier and more ornamental than shewn on plan. 20 Mr. Goodacre being unable to attend the meeting of the Works Committee, it was resolved to defer the consideration of his notice of motion re the Bishop's Meadow River Wall, but at the meeting of the Vestry on the 2nd March, Mr. Goodacre moved the following as an alternative scheme to the one referred to the Works Committee by the Vestry on the 17th February. River Embankment Amended Scheme. 1. That the concrete blocks be 24" by 12" by 12" laid " Flemish" bond instead of "Garden Wall" bond as shewn on plan. The face of blocks (3" in depth) composed of one part Portland cement to two parts Thames ballast. The remainder to consist of one part Portland cement to five of Thames ballast. The ballast to be sifted through a If" mesh sieve. The blocks as in plan will be more expensive and not so easy to lift and fix as above size. Scarboro' Sea Wall is built "Flemish" bond and has resisted the violent gales of the past 5 or 6 years without a fissure. 2. That the cement be stocked one month before using. The blocks made one month before being laid, and the concrete remain in the moulds three days. 3. That the coping on top of wall be moulded in situ, with apertures left on the top of same every 7 feet, to fix in the iron standard for the railings. 4. That the River Wall have an unbroken frontage, with (at the extreme west end) a flight of iron steps, of the same description as those on the Thames Embankment (opposite Cheyne Walk, Chelsea), from which, during the season, there is a very large boating traffic. This with the other alterations proposed will effect a reduction in the cost of construction to the extent of upwards of £1,000, in addition to utilising about 400 square yards, proposed to be taken for steps. The question of cost is an important consideration, as the Vestry will have to find the whole amount over and above the £5,000 tob e contributed by the Dondou County Council. 5. That the gas standards be placed on the inside kerb of footway (instead of on coping of wall, as shown on plan), otherwise half the light will be on the river instead of the embankment. 6. That the iron standards for the railings be heavier and more ornamental than shown on plan. 7. That the construction of the River Wall together with the making up of the ground, paving, fencing, laying out, &c., &c., be carried out in one contract, so as to prevent the possibility of divided responsibility in regard to the failure of any portion of the work. 8. That this amended scheme be tendered for (along with the Surveyor s), as an alternative one, cost will no doubt determine the Vestry as to which, or, if either, shall be carried out. An amendment was moved by Mr. Spraggs, and duly seconded, That the matter be referred to the Works Committee. On being put to the vote, the amendment was declared carried, and was put as a substantive motion and carried. 21 On the matter coming before the Works Committee they ordered the alternative scheme of Mr. Goodacre to stand over until an answer had been received from the London County Council with reference to the plan then before the Council, and at the meeting of the Vestry, held on the 16th March, 3892, two resolutions moved by Mr. Goodacre, and seconded by Mr. Lawrence, the first instructing the Clerk to write and ask the London County Council to inform the Vestry whether they (the Council) approved of the plans submitted to them by the Vestry's Surveyor re the Embankment of the Bishop s and West Meadows, and the second instructing the Clerk to report to the Vestry whether the Sub-Committee was appointed by the Vestry, when the meeting was held, who attended, the result of their deliberations, and if the same were submitted to the Works Committee, whether the Works Committee sent the same to the Vestry, and if so what the decision of the Vestry was thereon, were ordered to be referred to the Works Committee. Schemes before Parliament. At the meeting of the Vestry held on the 2nd December, 1891, the Clerk produced the Parliamentary plans and notices deposited on behalf of the London County Council re Cromwell Road Bridge, and , The Putney and Hammersmith Electric Light and Power Supply Limited, as to supplying Electric Light in Fulham Road, from Messrs. Stanfeld's Brewery to Cedar Road, and the Surveyor was directed to report on these matters to the Works and Lighting Committees respectively. Cromwell Road Bridge. On the 25th January, 1892, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Queen's Club, stating that they would quite approve the levying of an Improvement Rate for the purpose of constructing the Cromwell Road Bridge, if that was considered the best way of meeting the requirements, and the Vestry resolved (1) To offer no opposition to the London County Council estimate of £63,000 for the construction, etc., of the said bridge and approaches; (2) That the Improvement Rate to be levied as a Betterment be £25,000, instead of £22,000 as per bill; (3) That certain verbal alterations be made in the Bill, and (4) That subject to above, the Vestry offer no opposition to the Bill. The Solicitor reported to the Vestry on the 3rd February, 1892, that he had heard from the Parliamentary Agent that the London County Council agreed to the suggested alterations in the Bill, except the alteration of the amount of the Improvement Rate to be levied from £22,000 to £25,000, which he (the Solicitor) was informed should be considered when the Council was settling the Bill for the Committee of the House of Commons; and the Vestry instructed the Solicitor to write to the Parliamentary Agents of the London County Council explaining the reason of the Vestry why the Council should accede to the Vestry s decision as to the amount of the Improvement Rate. 22 Electric Lighting. Putney and Hammersmith Light and Supply Company, Ltd. In accordance with the resolution of the Vestry of the 2nd December, 1891, the Surveyor, on the 8th December, 1891, made his report to the Lighting Committee on the application by the Putney and Hammersmith Lighting and Supply Company, Limited, for powers to supply electricity from Stanfeld's Brewery to "Cedar Road, and the Committee, having considered same, referred the report to the Law and Parliamentary Committee, with a recommendation to oppose, and on the 6th January, 1892, the latter Committee reported to the Vestry that they had instructed the Solicitor to oppose the application in question, which report was adopted by the Vestry. The Solicitor was further instructed to serve the Board of Trade and the London County Council with the objections which the Vestry raised to the application of the Putney and Hammersmith Electric Light and Power Supply Company, Limited, for a Provisional Order which were sealed by the Vestry on the 3rd February, 1892, and at the Vestry on the 2nd March, 1892, a letter was read from the Secretary of Company, stating that they had abandoned the present application for obtaining powers for supplying electricity to the Parish of Fulham. Dust Disposal. Appointment of Sub-Committee On the September, 1891, your Sanitary Committee appointed a Sub-Committee, consisting of nine members, with Mr. George Williams, as Chairman, to consider and advise as to the best means to adopt for the disposal of house refuse, slop, manure, &c., of this parish, either by incineration, sorting or barging away. The Clerk to the Vestry having, by circular letter, ascertained the practice adopted by various Vestries and District Boards in disposing of their dust, &c., and the Sub-Committee having carefully considered the replies received, determined to visit a few of the depots in order, by personal observation and enquiries, to ascertain which, in their opinion, was the best mode of disposing of the same, having due regard to cost. Homsey Destructor They accordingly in the first place, visited the Destructor . erected in 1890, by the Homsey Local Board, at their Depot at High Street, Hornsey (which Destructor is considered by Engineers and others to be the best of its kind) and from information obtained on the spot it appeared that the land and works on which the Destructor was erected cost £8,006, that the cost of collecting and carting the refuse to the Destructor, amounted to 10d. per load, and the burning to 9d. per ton, and that the lecoupment from the sale of clinker, fine ashes, etc., only amounted to 2s. per load, whilst there was a residue of about 25 per cent, from which the Board were unable to derive a greater pecuniary benefit than 3d. per 23 Hampstead Destructor. The Sub-Committee also inspected the Hampstead Vestry's Destructor at Willesden, which however, they found would not in any way compare with the one at Hornsey. Newington Vestry depots. The Sub-Committee then, by invitation, visited the Depots of the St. Mary, Newington Vestry, situated at Sevenoaks, Longfield, and Meopham, in Kent, and minutely examined the way in which that Vestry treated their house refuse, etc., from which it appeared that since 1873, that Vestry had expended out of the rates the sum of £38,000, with which they had purchased about 30 acres of freehold land and erected thereon permanent buildings, and that from statistics supplied by the Clerk to that Vestry (who accompanied the sub-committee) it appeared that between 1873 and 1890, the profits which accrued from the sale of breeze and manure had amounted to £35,500, leaving only £2,500 of the £38,000 taken out of the rates to be paid back, the Vestry now possessing three valuable freehold depots at which to treat their refuse, etc. Advertiscmets for land.

Recommendation of Sub-Committee The Sub-Committee, having carefully considered the matter bearings, made their report to the Sanitary Committee, Recommending— "That the Sanitary Committee appoint an Engineer to report as to the opening of the canal at Dagenham, cost of so doing, its safety, &c.; and that, subject to his report being satisfactory, and the cost of opening not exceeding £300, the Vestry be recommended to offer £2,000 for the site, subject to the title and other deeds being satisfactory to the Vestry through their Solicitor." Referred back by Sanitary Committee. Sanitary Committee, on the recommendation of their Surveyor, referred the matter back, and instructed him to make a survey of the canal, and report thereon prior to any Engineer being called in, which he did; and the Sub-Committee subsequently visited the canal in company with Mr. Daniel, C.E. (a friend of Dr. J. R. Hill, who gave his services), when, in consequence of the outlay which he stated the Vestry would be called upon to incur in providing new dock gates, and clearing the mouth of the canal, &c., so as to make it navigable from the River Thames, being greater than they estimated, the scheme fell through. Land at Rainham. On the 19th January, 1892, the Clerk reported the result of the negotiations he had had with Mr. Thomson, Solicitor, in respect of some land abutting upon Rainham Creek, when the SubCommittee ordered the Surveyor to view the same, and report thereon at 25 the next meeting, which he did; and the Sub-Committee visited Rainham and Purfleet on the 11th February following, when they instructed the Clerk to write to several contractors for prices for barging the dust, &c., to Rainham, and he and the Surveyor were directed to draw up independent reports, showing the relative cost of the purchase of the land at Rainham as against that of barging, and present the same to the next meeting of the Sanitary Committee, which they did on the 1st March, when the Clerk was intructed to write to the Thames Conservators and Commissioners of the Essex Sewers making certain enquiries respecting the land. At the Sanitary Committee, on the 8th March, the Clerk having produced letters from the Commissioners of the Essex Sewers and Mr. Thomson, received since the last meeting, it was resolved:— "That advertisements be issued, through the Solicitor to the Vestry, for other suitable laud for the purpose of the disposal of dust, and the Clerk was instructed to ascertain what the charges, rates, &c., on the land at Rainham amounted to per annum, and by whom levied, and to also get the Surveyor of Purfleet to give him his estimate of the value of the land in question." On the 22nd March, the Clerk produced various communications received in response to the Solicitor's advertisement for suitable land, and from Contractors as to the barging away, and having reported how the matter stood at that time, he was ordered to write to Mr. Mandell, offering him 2s. 6d. per load to remove the dust for the next 12 months. Medical Officer of Health. At the meeting of the Vestry held on the 1st April, 1891, the Clerk read a letter from the Local Government Board enclosing copy of a letter addressed by them to Dr. Egan, calling upon him to resign. Resignation of Dr. Egan. The Clerk also read letter from Dr. Egan, resigning his position as Medical Officer of Health on account of failing health and eyesight, and inability to efficiently carry out the ordinary duties of the position, together with those imposed under the Inland Revenue and Housing of the Working Classes Acts, which resignation was accepted, and the Clerk was instructed to fill up the proposal for appointment of the Medical Officer of Health for submission to and approval by the Local Government Board, and the Sanitary Committee instructed to insert an advertisement in the West London Observer, Fulham Chronicle, and Lancet, that the Vestry would, on the 29th April, 1891, proceed to the election of a Medical Officer of Health. On the 3rd June, the Clerk produced to the Vestry the 24 applications he had received for the above appointment, which were referred to a Special meeting of the Sanitary Committee held on the 5th June, 1891. At a Special Vestry meeting, held on the 8th June, 1891, the Sanitary Committee reported that they had selected Drs. Jackson, Luff, Cooney, and Davis, to attend before the Vestry, and after these gentlemen had been interviewed, a vote was taken by ballot, when 26 Appointment of Dr. J. Edwin cooney. Dr. J. Edwin Cooney was declared duly elected subject to the approval of the Local Government Board, which approval was received on the 1st July, 1891. For a history of the working of the Sanitary Department since this date see Dr. Cooney's first Annual Report. Dust Inspector. At the meeting of the Vestry, held on the 21st October, 1891, the Surveyor reported the absence of Dust Inspector Witney through rheumatism, and it was resolved:- " That he be requested to send in a Medical Certificate, and on the 7th December, 1891, a Medical Certificate was received to the effect that the Dust Inspector was still suffering from rheumatism in the hand and ankle aggravated by a sprain received during the execution of his duties. Death of Mr. Witney. On the 6th January, 1892, the Vestry having been informed the death of Inspector Witney, it was resolved : — "That a letter of condolence be written by the Clerk to his son expressing the deep regret of the Vestry at his loss," and on the 25th January, 1892, the Clerk was instructed to issue advertisements in the usual papers for a Dust Inspector, and at a Special Meeting of the Vestry, called for the purpose of electing a Dust Inspector, on the Appointment of Mr. G. Hammacks. 17th February, 1892, Mr. G. Hammacks was appointed Dust Inspector in place of Mr. Witney, deceased, at a salary of 35s. per week. Recreation Ground, corner of Fulham Palace and Crown Roads. On the 1st April, 1891, the Vestry resolved:- "That the London County Council be informed that as their offer to contribute £500 per acre towards the cost of purchasing the Open Space was conditional on the Vestry ultimately undertaking to maintain the site as an Open Space, the Vestry are of opinion that the Council should at least pay £750 per acre," and they appointed Messrs. Spraggs, March, Margrie, Weatherley, Winfield, Long, and Cornwall, and the Rev. W. P. Hindley, and the Rev. Dr. Davies to wait upon the London County Council in support of the opinion of the Vestry. They also instructed the Clerk to write to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and ask them to reduce the price of the land to £1,000 per acre, pointing out that the conversion of the land into an Open Space would greatly enhance the value of their property in the neighbourhood when built upon, that the London County Council had not dealt with the Vestry in such a liberal spirit as was anticipated, and that a considerable portion of the land in question would have to be given up in order to allow of the widening of the roads, and the deputation appointed to wait upon the London County Council was also appointed to wait upon the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. 27 On the 29th April, 1891, the Clerk produced a letter which he had received from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners in reference to the proposed Open Space, stating that they did not feel at liberty to make any abatement on the very moderate price, which, in consideration of the object in view, they had offered to accept for the land. At the meeting of the Vestry on 13th May, 1891, a letter was read from Mr. Beale, one of the Fulham representatives at the London County Council, stating that he had given notice that he would move that the Council do subscribe one half of the cost of purchasing and laying o.ut the proposed Open Space at the corner of Fulham Palace and Crown Eoads, and on the 17th June, 1891, a further letter was read, from Mr. Beal, informing the Vestry that at a meeting of the Committee of the Council, on the 29th May, his notice of motion, as follows, was unanimously carried:— "That the Council be recommended to ccntribute half the cost of the purchase of the whole 9 acres of land at the corner of Crown Lane aud Fulham Palace Road, offered by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners at £1,250 an acre to the Vestry of Fulham, for a Recreation ground ; and also half the cost of laying out, such half not to exceed the sum of £1,875 conditionally on the purchase being carried out, the laying out completed, aud the ground opened to the public within a period to be fixed." The Lammas Rights aud Opeu Spaces Committee, on the 15th July, 1891, submitted to the Vestry the following extract from the minutes of the London County Council, and copies of correspondence for the information of the Vestry :— Adjourned Report of the Parks and Open Spaces Committee. The Council consider the following recommendation in the Report brought up on 9th June:- Proposed Open Space at Fidliam. That, subject to an estimate being submitted to it by the Finance Committee, as required by the statute, the Council do contribute £5,625, being half the cost of the purchase of nine acres of land at the corner of Crown Lane and Fulham Palace Road, offered by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners at £1,250 an acre to the Vestry of Fulham for a recreation ground ; and also half the cost of laying out such land, the half not to exceed the sum of £1,875, conditionally on the purchase being carried out, the laying out completed, and the ground opened to the public within a period of twelve months, and the plans and estimates being submitted to and approved by the Council." On the motion that the recommendation be adopted. Amendment moved by Mr. Beachcroft, seconded by Mr. Myer. That the original request made by the Vestry that the County Council should contribute one-half of the purchase money for the land at the corner of Crown Lane and Fulham Palace Road, the Vestry undertaking to acquire, lay out, and maintain the same, be acceded to, conditionally on the purchase and laying out being completed, and the ground opened to the public within a period of twelve months. Amendment put and declared to be carried. Carried as a substantive motion. " Besolved accordingly." 28 1, Temple Gardens, E.C. Dear Sir, 1st July 1891. Open space, Crown and Fulham Palace Roads. The Council decided yesterday to join with the Fulham Vestry in the purchase of the above, but declined to contribute any portion of the laying out. I did all that was possible to endeavour to induce the Council to assist in this latter, but the ground was so large, viz., nine acres, that it was considered undesirable, and members were unwilling to create such a precedent. Where the Council had previously contributed, it was in the cases of very small areas, such as church yards, &c. This large open space is now permanently secured, and will be an undoubted benefit to the inhabitants of Fulham. Yours truly, J. Denselow, Esq., (Signed) R. A. GERMAINE. Fulham Vestry, Walham Green, S.W. 1, Temple Gardens, E.C. Dear Sir, 4th July, 1801. Open space, Fulham Palace Road and Crown Road. Mr. Basil Holmes, Secretary of the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association, has written to ask me to impress upon the Fulham Vestry the necessity of accepting the Ecclesiastical Commissioners' offer without delay, as he informs me they will not allow it to remain open much longer. He adds that even if the space were not laid out at all, it would be exceedingly useful and beneficial to the district; and fully anticipates the laying out money will soon be obtained. I gather from this that if some application were made to the Metropolitan Gardens Association, that body might be willing to subscribe a portion of the laying out cost. Will you kindly read this letter, in addition to my previous one, to your Open Spaces Committee. Yours truly, J. Denselow, Esq., (Signed) R. A. GERMAINE. Fulham Vestry, Walham Green, S.W. 83, Lancaster Gate, W. The Clerk to the Vestry of Fulham, 7th July, 1891. Vestry Hall, Walham Green, S.W. Dear Sir, Proposed Recreation Ground in Fulham Palace Road. We have been informed by the County Council that while agreeing to bear one-half of the cost of purchasing this ground, it declined, as a matter of principle, to sanction the recommendation of its Committee to subscribe a further sum towards the laying out. Your Vestry has, no doubt, received a similar intimation. I am directed by this Association to express its earnest hope that your Vestry will not allow the diminution of the expected contribution of the Council by under £2000 to prevent it from closing with the offer of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. 29 The following are some of the considerations which it appears to this Association should induce the Vestry to purchase the land:— (1.) The population in that end of Fulham is rapidly increasing. (2.) Open spaces are very few in Fulham. Even including Bishops Meadow, &c., not yet available, they are under 30 acres for nearly 80,000 people, or 2,600 people to 1 acre of open space, whereas the average for West London is more like 1 acre to 700 inhabitants. Nor are the open spaces in Fulham very near to that we desire to see secured. (3). The offer is admittedly a low one, and if the opportunity be lost, the land will undoubtedly be built on, and no other will be available at the price or so conveniently situated. (4). The County Council has shown its appreciation of the public spirit of the Vestry in wanting to acquire the ground, by making a substantial advance on its original offer of £500. The Council are now prepared to give £625 per acre, £125 more than before, and this is as much as the late Metropolitan Board gave in similar cases. (5.) There is no doubt the estimate of £3,750 for the laying out, which made the Council's share £1,875, is a high one, and our experience goes to show that a most useful recreation ground could be formed for very much less, say more like half the money, i.e. £200 or £250 per acre. The neighbourhood, we conceive, does not want so much an elaborate garden as a recreation ground, with trees, seats, &c., which will not be so costly to maintain as an ornamental garden. If, therefore, we are correct, the failure of the Council to contribute £1,875 to the laying out, would not involve much, if any additional expense to the Vestry, who can probably keep the expenditure on this head to £2,000. The main thing is to get the ground, and even were not a sixpence spent on its laying out it would prove an untold boon. For these and other reasons the Association hopes the Vestry will close with the Ecclesiastical Commissioners without further delay, as we fear if they do not get an acceptance of their offer before the holidays, they will withdraw it. It has, as you are aware, been kept open nearly a whole year. We have twice got the original time extended in view of negotiations with the Council. To show the practical interest this Association takes in the question we are prepared, as stated in Lord Meath's letter of 28th March, to supply the ground in any case with an adequate number of seats, and to further contribute, if required, towards the expense of laying out. How much this further help might amount to rather depends on the state of our finances, but the Vestry may rely on us doing our utmost, as we feel the ground is greatly needed. The Association fully believes that there would be but little difficulty, if money is really wanted, in raising the amount required by public appeal, and by applications to various public bodies {e.g. Hammersmith might be asked). The Association would, if need be, in addition to subscribing itself, help the Vestry in appealing for the balance. I would refer you to Lord Meath's letter of 28th March, and my own of 15th May, 1891. I may say that in similar cases we have helped on a subscription list by £100 and £200 grants. I would remind the Vestry that only recently we gave it a grant of £100 for tree planting, as we are aware Fulham needs assistance as much as any East End Parish. Trusting the Vestry will see fit to purchase the ground, I am, yours faithfully, BASIL HOLMES, Secretary. 30 and recommend that in. consideration of the promised support of the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association, the offer of the London County Council be accepted. On the 29th July, 1891, the same Committee recommended the Vestry, that the offer of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to dispose of the vacant land at the corner of Fulham Palace and Crown Roads to the Vestry for an open space, for the sum of £1,250 per acre or £11,250 be accepted, and that it be referred to the Law and Parliamentary Committee to carry out the conveyance of the site, which recommendation was carried unanimously, and at the same meeting the Finance Committee were instructed by the Vestry to apply to the London County Council for a loan for the Vestry's moiety for the cost of purchasing the site for the longest period possible, and to consider whether the repayments can be made in equal instalments of principal and interest on the annuity system, and the Clerk was also instructed to write to the London County Council calling their attention to the action pending with reference to the Lammas Eights, and asking them what action they intended taking in the matter. On the 9th September, the Clerk received instructions from the Vestry to write to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners enquiring upon what terms they would be willing to lend the Vestry, say, £6,000 (their moiety of the cost of the purchase of the proposed open space in Fulham Palace Eoad) for fifty years, or for the longest period possible, to be repaid in equal instalments of principal and interest, and on the 23rd September, 1891, the Clerk was instructed to make a similar application to the London County Council. On the 4th November, 1891, the Lammas Rights and Open Spaces Committee reported to the Vestry that they had received a letter from the Clerk to the London County Council, that the Parks and Open Spaces Committee of the Council would be prepared to recommend the Council to favourably consider the question of contributing towards the costs incurred by the Vestry in the suits now pending, respecting Lammas Rights in Fulham, but that prior to further considering the subject, the Committee would be glad to be informed in detail of the nature of the suits, the letter was referred to the Law and Parliamentary Committee. They also reported on the same date, that having considered a communication from the London County Council, requesting the Vestry to revise their estimate of the cost of purchasing and laying out the recreation ground, they had submitted a further estimate amounting to £7,357 5s., and recommended that application be made to the London County Council for a loan for that amount in lieu of the previous application for £8,513, which recommendation was carried. At the meeting of the Vestry, on the loth November, 1891, the Solicitor submitted draft agreement of the purchase from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of the land at the corner of Fulham Palace and Crown Roads, and 31 it was referred to him to make such amendments as he might deem advisable, and to complete the matter as early as possible. On the 6th January, 1892, the Law and Parlimentary Committee reported that they approved of the draft agreement for the purchase of the land for the open space at the corner of Fulham Palace and Crown Roads, and on the 25th January, they recommended that the seal of the Vestry be affixed to the agreement, which was accordingly done. On the 17th February, 1892, the Solicitor reported to the Vestry that he had exchanged contracts for the purchase of the open space and had also examined the abstracts of title which had been delivered by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and he was of opinion that subject to satisfactory answers to certain questions, the title was one that the Vestry could except; and at the same meeting the Vestry instructed the Surveyor to make application to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for permission to enter on the Recreation ground and on obtaining such permission, to commence the work of laying out same with all expedition, a cheque for £1,000 was drawn for the deposit on the purchase of this open space, the same was directed to be forwarded to the Solicitor for him to hand to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and to obtain permission to take possession of the land, and the Clerk was instructed to write to the London County Council asking them to expedite the loan of £7.300, being the Vestry's moiety of the cost of the purchase and laying out of the open space. At the meeting of the Vestry, on the 2nd March, 1892, the Solicitor reported that the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had satisfactorily answered the Requisitions of Title which he caused to be delivered and they had also approved of the form of conveyance which he had submitted to the Vestry for sealing, informing them that the purchase money to be paid into the Bank of England, on Thursday, the 3rd March, would amount to £11,200 18s., a cheque for which was accordingly drawn and the conveyance sealed. On the 3rd March, the Solicitor accompanied by the Clerk completed the Conveyance to the Vestry of the piece of land at the corner of Fulham Palace and Crown Roads, from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. And on the 16th March, 1892, the Solicitor submitted a Memorial of the deed of Conveyance for sealing by the Vestry and the same was accordingly sealed, and at the same time the Lammas Rights and Open Spaces Committee reported that the purchase money having been paid to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and the deeds exchanged relative to the ground at the corner of Fulham Palace and Crown Roads, the Chairman and Clerk had attended on Tuesday, the 8th inst., to receive the keys from the Caretaker, and obtain formal possession of the land, and afterwards had returned to the Town Hall, and had instructed the Surveyor to at once commence setting out the work, which was done on the 9th March. 32 CONCLUSION. Appended to this report will be found the Balance Sheets, &c., of the various Charities of the parish, of the Churchwardens and Overseers as regards Precepts, one report of the Parish Officers re perambulation of Parish, and two reports of the Public Analyst, all of which have been ordered by the Vestry to be printed with this report. I cannot, however, close this report without tendering my best thanks to the whole of the officers in my Department for the able assistance they have rendered me during the past twelve months. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, W. J. HELLIER DENSELOW, Clerk to the Vestry. 33 FULHAM WASTE LAND and LYGON ALMSHOUSES, Fulham Palace Road, S.W.

To the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor of the Parish of Fulham. Gentlemen, I beg to report that on Friday, the 27th May, ultimo, a Committee consisting of Messrs. E. A. Cornwall, L.C.C., Churchwarden; G. F. Abery, Overseer; W. G. Marsh, Vestryman; accompanied by Messrs. A. Robinson, Vestry Clerk; J. G. Hall, Assessing Surveyor; J. P. Norrington, Surveyor to the Vestry; and Messrs. Henry Burns and W. Thatcher as Visitors, proceeded to perambulate the Boundaries of the Parish, commencing at the mouth of the Chelsea Creek, and proceeding thence along the line of the West London Extension Railway to Addison Road Station; along the Hammersmith Road to the western end of St. Mary's Churchyard, through St. Paul's Schools and grounds to Talgarth Road; this point was reached at about half-past three in the afternoon, the remainder was therefore left over until Wednesday, the 1st June. On the 1st inst., the following gentlemen were present, viz.:—Messrs. E. A. Cornwall, L.C.C.; A. Williams, Overseer; G. F. Abery, Overseer; W. R. Sayer, Vestryman; William Marks, Vestryman; A. Robinson, Vestry Clerk; J. G. Hall, Assessing Surveyor; J. P. Norrington, Surveyor to the Vestry; and Messrs. Burns and Cavers as Visitors. The party met at St. Mary's Church, and after reviewing the passage which formerly existed at the western side of 155, Hammersmith Road, as a means of communication with the Black Bull Ditch, (which is now blocked partly by the eastern wall of the St. Paul's School premises, and partly occupied for the storage of building materials and trucks); proceeded along Edith Road and Gliddon Road to the bridge crossing the District Railway, thence along the line of the District Railway Company to the eastern end of Yeldham Road; along Yeldham Road; crossing Fulham Palace Road; along Distillery Lane to Messrs. Haig's Distillery at the side of the River Thames, where the perambulation terminated. The following is a list of the boundary stones and the resolutions decided upon in connection therewith. No. 53a. This stone is situate on the embankment at the mouth of the Creek, and is in a very dilapidated condition, and it was decided that the stone next on the right hand side of it should be cut, dated F.P., 1892, 53a. No. 53. This stone could not be found, and it was resolved that a new stone be cut and fitted as near the edge of the Creek as possible, and level with the surface of the ground, No. 52. Same conditions as No. 53. No. 51. This stone is situate on the embankment, and is marked 1872, and was found to be in fair condition. o. a.

This stone is inside the Gas Works underneath the cranie, and in a very dilapidated state, it was consequently resolved that a new stone (granite) be fitted of the same size as the Chelsea stone, and marked F.P., 1892, No. 46. No. 46a. There is a stone let into the parapet of the wall, distinctly marked F.P., but there is no date or number upon it, it therefore was resolved that it should be marked 1892, 46a. No. 45a. It was resolved that a stone be fitted into the wall of the signal box, to indicate the distance from the middle of the Creek, marked with this number. No. 45. This stone is situate on the Stanley Bridge, but the number was very iudistinct, it was therefore decided that the same be re-cut. No. 44. Was found marked F.P., 1873, in good state, in the wall on the bridge. No. 43. This stone is to be placed in position on the land on the east side of the railway. No. 43a.

Two stones were found belonging to the Parish of Kensington in the wall of the railway, with the inscriptions respectively, "51 feet 6 ins., West Kensington," and "23 feet 6 ins., West Kensington Parish," and it was resolved that a Fulham stone should be placed opposite these two points. No. 39. This stone is marked 37 feet 10 ins., and is in the railway embankment. The number has been obliterated, it therefore requires marking. No. 38. Could not be found, it was therefore resolved that a stone be cut aud fitted in the place shown on the boundary map. No. 37d. It was resolved that a stone be fitted opposite the Kensington stone, situate in the wall of the cemetery under the elder tree, marked with this number. No. 37c. This stone is to be marked and fitted opposite the Kensington stone. No. 37b. Is also to be marked and fitted opposite the Kensington stone. No. 37a. This is situate on the railway lines, and is marked F.P., 1879, and it was resolved that the number be re-cut. No. 37. This stone could not be found, it was therefore decided that a stone be fitted. No. 36. Was found on the 6-foot way of the line of railway through West Brompton Station, and requires re-cutting. No. 35. Was found on Lillie Bridge, on the outside, dated 1873, and in good condition. 40 No. 34. This stone is fixed in the wall of the Lillie Bridge, at the side of the roadway, dated 1860, and the number requires re-cutting. No. 33. This stone is on the other side of the roadway of the bridge, but is covered by the hoarding now fixed there. No. 32. This stone is on the outside wall on the northern side of the bridge, and is in fair condition. No. 31. Could not be found, but it was understood that it should be under the bridge in the line of railway, it was however thought that the marks in the bridge were adequate. No. 30. This stone was found on the railway embankment, dated 1860, the measurement marked thereon being "36 feet 3 ins. east," and was in fair state of preservation. No. 29. Was found on the embankment, dated 1860, the measurement marked thereon being "36 feet 3 ins. east," and was in fair condition. No. 29a. Has been removed from its proper place between the rails to about six feet nearer the embankment and been turned sideways, the inscription being almost buried in the earth ; it was consequently resolved that the stone be reinstated in its former position, and repaired if necessary. No. 28. This stone is situate on the railway, being a flat stone and in good condition. No. 27. This stone is alongside of the railway, and is in good condition. No. 26. This stone was found in position, but the inscription relating to the measurement had been obliterated, it was therefore resolved that the same be recut " 33 feet 3 ins., east." No. 25.

On railway, dated 1860, number requires recutting. No. 18. Should be on railway by Portland Place fence, could not be found, it was therefore decided that the same be fitted if necessary. No, 17. This stone could not be found, although there is a Hammersmith stone fixed in the wall of St. Paul's School premises, without any measurement cut thereon, it is therefore assumed that this stone is the limit of their boundary, and that a Fulham stone should be fitted alongside thereof ; there is strip of land between No. 155 Hammersmith Road and the last mentioned point, which, it is understood, was formerly used as a means of access to the Old Black Bull Ditch ; this land was found to be blocked at the end by the wall of St. Paul's School; and the Portion nearest the Hammersmith Road was filled by old building refuse and trucks, a wooden gateway was also fitted 41 preventing the passage over the Parish Boundary, which was also locked; upon reference to the notes taken in the Perambulation, 1876, it was observed that a similar state of affairs existed at that date, for Mr. J. Bond was then requested to remove certain material which had been deposited on the line of this portion of the Boundary, which it is alleged he promised to do. I understand from a letter which I submit to you this evening, from the Vestry's Surveyor, that permission is sought to build on this strip of land which forms no part of the adjoining property, but as far as could be ascertained was left open in order to enable the Parish Officers to perambulate the boundaries; and Mr. Cornwall and Mr. Jones, Road foreman, both state that they had access through this passage in previous perambulations. I therefore think that this matter should be inquired into further. No. 16. Since previous perambulations St. Paul's School premises have been erected, and the stones therefore require revision throughout the whole premises. Nos. 14a, 14b, 1'5, 15a, 15b, 15c, 16, 16a, 16b, 16c, are within the above mentioned premises. No. 14. This stone is now situate in the back garden of No. 1 St. Paul's Studios, with a fellow stone belonging to the Parish of Hammersmith; it was therefore resolved that the kerb stone outside No. 1 St. Paul's Studios be marked with a line indicating the direction of the boundary. No 13a. This stone is situate on the crown of the Embankment at the rear of No. 1 St. Paul's Studios, and is in good condition. No. 13. This stone could not be traced, it was consequently resolved that a stone be fixed in the wall on the south side of the railway, and that the pavement be marked on both sides of Margravine Gardens indicating the direction of the boundary line. No. 12. This stone has now been lost to view by the houses being built in Margravine Gardens, but was understood to be fixed in the boundary wall of the Hammersmith Cemetery, it was, however, resolved that a stone be fitted in the boundary wall at the rear of Nos. 31 and 33 Margravine Gardens, in the party wall between the gardens of the two houses. No. 12a. This stone, it was understood, was fitted when the subject of the paving of Margravine Gardens was under consideration, and is situate in the Dwarf wall in front of No. 35 Margravine Gardens, and dated 1888. No. 12b. It was resolved that a stone bearing this number be fitted in the Dwarf wall of No. 16 Margravine Gardens, on the left hand side of the stone belonging to the Parish of Hammersmith, and close beside thereof. No. 11a. This stone was found on the railway embankment, dated 18/6, and in good condition. No. 11. Is situate on the railway lines, dated 1876 and marked "18 feet, north;' there is also a duplicate stone between the railway lines indicating the exact boundary. 42 No. 10. This stone is situate on the Embankment, and bears the inscription "1876, 23 feet 6 inches, north," at the back. I was found that a stone bearing the letters "H. P." had been cemented to this stone, although a duplicate stone was dis covered between the lines, indicating the boundary, whicl was found, upon measurement, had been moved about 6 fee towards Hammersmith Parish. It was resolved that the stone fixed to the first mentioned be removed, but the latte be not interfered with. No. 9. This stone was found on the embankment of the Distric Railway, is on the boundary line, and in good condition dated 1873. No. 8a. This stone was found on the embankment before mentioned a a point where the boundary line diverts from the railway. No. 8. This stone could not be found. No. 7. This stone could not be found. No. 6. This stone was found to be fitted in the wall of the house known formerly as Halstead Villa, dated 1873, and marked "10 fee 4 inches, south." It was resolved that three or four stones be fitted from the lint of railway to the the Fulham Palace Road. No. 5. This stone was not found and was probably removed when the estate was thrown open for building. It was resolved tha the kerb on the south side of the Yeldham Road be markec with the measurement. No. 4. This boundary mark has now been substituted by a line cut in the pavement outside No. 76 Fulham Palace Road, and was considered sufficient. No. 3. This stone was found in the Distillery grounds, fixed in the walk on the north side of the works, marked " 2 feet 6 ins.'' No. 3a, It was resolved that a stone be fixed in the north east corne of the Distillery premises, as the distance between the Fulhan Palace Road and No. 3 stone was considerable. No. 2. This stone is fixed in the wall abutting on the River, and re. quired recutting. No. 1. This stone is understood to define the boundary on the centre of Putney Bridge, which it was considered unnecessary to visit I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, Ar. Robinson, Vestry Clerk.

GODWIN CLAYTON, F.I.C., ETC., Public Analyst to the Vestry. Chemical Laboratory, 43 and 44, Holborn Viaduct, E.C., . 10th June, 1892. To the Chairman and Members of the Fulham Vestry. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the honour to report that during the year ended on March 31st, 1892 two hundred and twelve samples of Food and Drugs were submitted to me for analysis. Of these samples eighty were obtained by Mr. Inspector A. A Croucher, seventy-uine by Mr. Inspector W. H. Grigg, and fifty-three by Mr. Inspector C. B. Jones. In addition, I received for analysis, from the Medical Officer of Health to the Vestry, Dr. E. Cooney, D.P.H., etc., 45 wo special samples of milk (date of receipt November 5th, 1891), and from one Surveyor to the Vestry, Mr. J. P.

The total number of samples analysed and eported on was thus two hundred and nineteen. Taking the population of Fulham shown by the census of April 6th, 1891, lamely, 91,640, the number of samples purchased during the year, under he Sale of. Food and Drugs Act and Margarine Act, was equivalent to one sample for every 432 individuals. The samples of food comprised ninety-seven of milk, twenty-eight of Dutter, twenty-nine of coffee, ten of Demerara sugar, five of mustard, two of Oepper, three of arrowroot, three of sweets, two of gin, and twelve of whiskey. The samples of drugs consisted of seveuteen seidlitz powders, and four samples of citrate of magnesia.

It may be convenient if I here state that, during the year ending March 31st last, I received no samples of any of the following articles of food:—Bread, condensed milk, cream, cheese, lard, oatmeal, flour, yeast, tinned meats, meat extracts, jams, pickles, vinegar, sauces, olive oil, wines, rum, brandy, beer, and aerated beverages; nor of the following drugs:—Syrup of senna, compound liquorice powder, paregoric, syrup of poppies, sal volatile, glycerine, saffron, wine of quinine, tincture of quinine, ammoniated tincture of quiuine, antimonial wine, wine of ipecacuanha, citrate of iron and quinine, mercury with chalk, Fowler's solution, fluid magnesia, syrup of squill, precipitated sulphur, spirit of nitrous ether, solution of perchloride of iron, and rectified spirit. I would respectfully suggest that samples of some of these articles should from time to time be purchased. I would venture to point out, also, that it would be well if the collection of samples for analysis could, as far as possible, be spread over the whole of each quarter, and proceeded with at short and fairly regular intervals (fortnightly, for instance), as was the case during the first three quarters of the year. The 49 samples representing the fourth quarter were all obtained between the 4th and 31st March, inclusive. Milk. It will be seen from Table II. that the adulterated samples of milk constituted over one-fifth of the entire number of samples of milk analysed. The proportions of added water found in the samples returned as adulterated ranged from 4 per cent. to 38 per cent.; and the sample containing 38 per cent. of added water had also been deprived of 28 per cent. of fat. In this case a fine of 10s. only was imposed! In 16 instances, samples were reported on as "poor" or "inferior" quality: in cases coming under this category, there is not infrequently a probability that a part of the fat originally present has been removed, and that the samples are not otherwise immaculate; but as the conclusions of the Public Analyst depend upon calculations necessarily based on low standards of quality, it is impossible to report upon samples of this character as adulterated. Dilution with water and abstraction of fat, are now, as in the past, the most widely practised and generally recognized forms of milk adulteration; but many samples are found on analysis to contain variable quantities of boracic acid, added as a preservative; and the question whether the addition of boracic acid to milk should not be regarded as an objectionable practice, and a species of sophistication, is in some quarters rapidly coming to the front. Observations have been made tending to show that small doses of boracic acid have an injurious action on the digestive organs, but there is still difference of opinion in reference to this subject. Fiom the returns made to the Local Government Board for the year 1890, it appears that milk no longer retains its former deplorable pre-eminence as the article of food most subject to adulteration; but the ratio of 49 adulterated to genuine samples is still considerably higher in the Parish of Fulham than it should be, and exceeds the proportions in some other metropolitan parishes, and in most of the large manufacturing towns. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the very small fines which are at present so often imposed in cases of milk adulteration are insufficient to deter dishonest dealers from a resort to this profitable, but most reprehensible, form of sophistication. Fines of 10s., in cases in which more than a tenth part, more than a fifth part, and even over one-third of the samples are added water, appear altogether disproportionate and unsuitable. The inadequacy of the fines imposed was remarked upon in the last Annual Report of the Local Government Board. Butter. The proportion of adulterated to genuine samples of butter was even larger than in the case of milk; but, in this comparison, due allowance must be made for the fact that the total number of samples of butter analysed was much smaller. Had more samples of butter been examined, the ratio might have been less considerable. The samples returned as adulterated consisted, without exception, of "margarine." No excessive quantity of water, or salt, was found in any of the samples. Coffee. Both as regards the ratio of adulterated to genuine samples, and the quantity of the adulterant, coffee was, among the samples of food, facile princejps; the amounts of chicory (the only foreign ingredient which it at present appears worth the vendor's while to add) ranging from 27 to as much as 90 per cent! In fact, more than 50 per cent. of chicory was present in most of the adulterated samples. This is evidently a highly profitable form of adulteration, and appears to flourish, in spite of the noteworthy fact that some heavy fines have been imposed. Indeed, for some reason or another, the fines imposed on the vendors of the samples of adulterated coffee, were mostly higher than the penalties generally inflicted in the cases of milk adulteration. It is difficult to explain this. There can be no two opinions as to the relative importance and value of milk and coffee as articles of diet. Milk is so unapproachable as a food, especially for the young, that a very moderate addition of water to it would seem to be not less serious an offence than a considerable admixture of chicory with coffee. Demerara Sugar. In the one sample of sugar certified as adulterated, the analysis showed the presence of an artificial dye, with which colourless sugar crystals had been treated, in order to imitate the more expensive, slightly yellow, Demerara cane sugar. This somewhat singular form of sophistication has not been uncommon, of late. 50 Whiskey. The one sample of adulterated whiskey, and the remainder of the samples of food (all of which latter were returned as genuine), call for no especial remark. Seidlitz Powders. No less than twelve out of the seventeen Seidlitz powders received for analysis were certified as being not of the composition prescribed in the British Pharmacopoeia. In eleven cases, the quantities of tartaric acid were widely different from, and less than, the proportion required to be present; in two cases, a foreign ingredient, sulphate of magnesia, was discovered; and five of the powders were destitute of the most distinctive component of a Seidlitz powder, the Rochelle salt, or tartarated soda. This is a very unsatisfactary condition of affairs; and, should a recent legal decision be upheld, according to which Seidlitz powders hitherto purchased for analysis have not been divided in compliance with the Act, it is possible that there will in future be considerable difficulty in successfully proceeding against vendors of improperly compounded Seidlitz powders. Sale of Food and Drugs Act (1875) Amendment Bill (No. 168). I would take the present opportunity of calling attention to the Bill (No. 168), to amend the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, now before the House of Commons, prepared and brought in by Dr. Cameron, M.P., and others. Although there is no prospect of this Bill being passed during the present Session, it is desirable that its provisions should be widely known, so that, when it comes up for further discussion, it should meet with such criticism as may be necessary. One of the sections of the Bill is as follows:— "The twenty-fifth section of the said Act shall be and is hereby amended by the deletion of the word 'written' before the words 'warranty to that effect,' and every wholesale trader or manufacturer of any article of food or drug, or other person who in the course of trade shall sell to any person any article of food or drug, with intent that the same may be resold by retail in the state in which it is purchased from him, shall, unless he has in writing informed the purchaser to the contrary, be deemed, for the purposes of the said Act, to have given a warranty to the person purchasing from him that such article of food or drug is of the nature, substance, and quality demanded by such purchaser." According to this clause, a special warranty as to the purity of an article sold by one trader to another not being required, every invoice or bill would be held to constitute such warranty; and the mere production in Court of an invoice would exonerate the accused: further, as there is no provision in the Bill for the prosecution of the giver of the invoice, the wholesale 51 dealer, as well as the retail vendor, would in most cases escape conviction. Another consideration is that very many of the original vendors reside abroad, and cannot be reached by the Act. There can be little doubt that f the Bill became law, with the above quoted section unmodified, the operation of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act would to a considerable extent one rendered nugatory. Agaiu, the provisions in this Bill as to the sale of mixtures of chicory and coffee would seem to require modification. I must conclude my report, with an acknowledgment of the unvarying courtesy extended to me by all the officials of the Vestry, with whom I nave been associated. I have the honour to be, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, E. Godwin Clayton, F.I.C., F.C.S.

In the month of May, 1891, I was instructed by the Finance Committee to bring up a return shewing the relative cost of the Vestry keeping its own horses as against hiring them, and accordingly on the 25th of that month, presented to them the following report:— (Accountant's Department), Town Hall, Walliam Green, S.W. May 25th, 1891. To the Chairman and Members of the Finance Committee. Gentlemen, Re Horses. In accordance with the resolution passed at the last Meeting of the Vestry, I have made a careful abstract and estimate of keeping our own horses as against hiring them. The basis of the calculation is the supposition that the stables are full, viz.;— 44 horses, otherwise the relative cost is somewhat greater. Against the apparent deficit, must be placed the better class of animals and the extra amount of work obtained from each. The price paid to Contractors for horse hire, viz.:— 9s. 6d. per day includes horse, man and cart, the latter right beiug exercised to the extent of about 1 cart to every 4 horses.

The report is as follows: Accountant's Department, June 20th, 1891. To the Chairman and Members of the Finance and Cartage Committees. Gentlemen, In accordance with instructions I have taken out the real cost during 1889-90 and 1890-91, of keeping of horses, and also the average number of horses kept during that period. You will perceive that the relative cost of keep per horse, viz., £71 19s. 6d. is somewhat greater than that of £63 12s. 9d. mentioned in my previous report, but this is to be accounted by the fact that only the exact number of horses are included, as against room for 44, which formed the basis of my last calculation. I remain, Gentlemen, your obedient Servant, R. H. Meyer, F.S.A.A. Accountant to the Vestry. 65 Particulars. 1889-90 (21 horses.) 1890-91 (32 horses.) Total actual cost per annum.

In September 1891, the Chairman of the Finance Committee raised a question as to the advisability of the Town Hall being connected with the Telephone Exchange, and called for answers to the three following questions relating to the postage and petty cash expenses of the Vestry:- Question. Answer. (1) Amount spent during year for postage and telegrams? and what amount could have been saved by use of the telephone? Vestry's Account £53 9 0 "New Streets" Account 29 9 9 Total £82 18 9 It is impossible to say how much of this could have been saved by the use of the telephone, but it is surmised that it would have been of a very trifling amount. (2) Amount spent for travelling expenses? £26 9 11 (3) Amount spent as petty cash? Vestry's Account £108 0 8 "New Streets" Account 103 15 7 £211 16 3 HAMMERSMITH VESTRY. During the year 1891-92, the total sum of £556 9s. 2d. has been paid to the above Vestry, being for the year's superannuations to retired officials of the late Fulham District Board of Works, and for part maintenance of Hammersmith Road. CONTRIBUTION TO PLANT TREES IN PUBLIC THOROUGHFARES. A sum of £100 was received under this heading during the year 1890-91 from the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association towards the cost of planting trees in the Parish. At 25th March, 1892, the balance of £44 5s. 6d. standing on this account had been expended. LOCAL TAXATION RETURNS. Under 23 and 24 Victoria, c. 51, and 40 and 41 Victoria, c. 66, it is enacted that every Vestry, District Board, &c., shall make a return annually of the sums levied or received by or in interest of rates, taxes, &c., aud of the expenditure thereof, to one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State. Under the above Acts, the Statistical Department of the Local Government Board issue, during the month of July or August in each year, a form embracing the various heads of receipts and expenditure, and of loans, &c., employed by local authorities. In August, 1891, forms (in duplicate) for e Local Taxation Returns were received by this Vestry, and referred to me kll up. This was duly done, and on my presenting same to the finance Committee, they instructed the Clerk to return the form to the .Local Government Board. 67 PRECEPTS OF CORPORATE BODIES. The Central Boards issuing precepts on the Vestry were the Metropolitan Board of Works and the School Board for London; now the latter only, as the precept of the Loudon County Council, the successors of the late Metropolitan Board of Works, is made on the Guardians of Fulham Union, and so becomes chargeable on the Poor Rate instead of the Local Rates, as was formerly the case with the Consolidated Rate. The following statement will show the amounts paid by the Fulham Parish through the late District Board, the Fulham Vestry, &c., to the Metropolitan Board, over which they had no direct control.

(exclusive of the Election expenses). This is chargeable on the General Rate, and is equal to a rate of 10¾d. in the £, the amount being an increase of £1,710 7s. 8d. on the previous year's precept, and allowing for an increase in the rateable value of £41,144 as against the increase last year of £12,225, the Vestry are enabled—in the face of the large increase in the amount of the precept—to decrease the rate by 5/8 d. in £ on that of 1890-91.

With reference to the New Streets Accounts, during the past year, there has been received the sum of £27,359 16s. 9d. on account of Apportionments made. The amounts still due by contributors are—On old Roads, transferred to this Vestry by the late District Board of Works, the sum of £207 l1s. 4d., and on the Streets taken to by this Vestry during the past six years the sum of £18,915 l1s. 1d., making the total due on New Streets to be £19,123 2s. 5d. On pages Nos. 114-123 will be found statements of New Streets Account in detail. Since the incorporation of the Vestry of Fulham, in March 1886, there have been sealed 200 original apportionments for "New Streets" Paving and Sewering works amounting to £112,462 2s. 9d., of this number, fifteen have been declared bad and irrecoverable through sundry causes, by the magistrates, and the apportionments thereon amounting to £10,395 1s., have been rescinded, and where money had been paid by contributors, it was refunded in full, of this number eight have been re-apportioned, and works prodeeded with. Of the 191 good apportionments, the works have been completed in 146 cases, with the result that the estimate was exceeded in 31 cases, necessitating the sealing of additional apportionment to the amount of £1,390 l1s. l1d., while in 102 cases the estimate was more than sufficient and allowed a return to be made to the owners of £11,355 2s. 6d., and in the remaining 13 cases, the estimate just covered the actual cost of the works. To show the magnitude of the New Streets work, and that the property of the Fulham Parish is not held by a few individuals. I may mention that the details of the numerous apportionments, etc., necessitated the opening of nearly 5,000 ledger accounts, entailing a large amount of clerical labour. LABOUR, &c.—WAGES ACCOUNT. The Parishioners will form some idea of the rapid development of the Parish by the comparative statement of the Labour Wages Accounts for 1886 and that of 1892. On the 27th day of January, 1886, the Vestry passed the following resolution, on the recommendation of the Works Committee:— " That in order to efficiently carry out the works required in the making, maintaining, and cleansing of the street and sewers in the Parish, a staff of Artisans and Labourers be employed as follows:— 70 30 Scavengers 1 Ganger 4 Spreaders 12 Ground and Sewermen 1 Ganger 1 Bricklayer 1 Labourer 1 Mason 1 Labourer 6 Flushers and Gullymen 1 Depot Watchman 1 Storekeeper and Messenger 1 Engine Driver Pecking Gang, averaging 4 men, as required Average weekly wages, £76 0 0 At the same time the Cartage Department Staff of Labourers consisted of the following:— 10 Dustmen, with horses 5 „ without horses 9 Carmen, with horses 1 Odd Man 1 Horsekeeper 1 Stableman Average weekly wages, £32 0 0 The following shows the number of men, and average weekly cost in 1892:— Works Department:— 66 Scavengers 1 Foreman of ditto 26 Spreaders, ground and Sewermen 1 Ganger of ditto 2 Men at Dust and Slop Shoots 5 Masons 5 Labourers 1 Bricklayer 1 Labourer 2 Wood Paviors 1 Asphalter 1 Labourer 1 Engine Driver 1 Steam Roller Driver 3 Followers (Sweepers) 5 Watchmen 1 Depot man and Messenger 4 Flushers and Gullymen 1 Disinfecting Man Barge and Pecking Gang, average 4 men, as required Average weekly wages, £175 0 0 71 Cartage Department:— 18 Dustmen, with horses 9 „ without horses 28 Carmen, with horses 1 Stableman 1 Watchman 2 Horsekeepers 3 Wheelwrights 1 Painter 3 Farriers or Smiths Average weekly wages, £90 0 0 In addition to the above, extra men are put on as occasion requires for special works, or in case of a heavy fall of snow, etc. TOWN HALL LETTING.

Loans 10,731 0 0 7,381 14 9 Works Department 11,191 10 6 9,874 2 8 Cartage 11,416 0 1 9,980 16 10 Establishment Charges 3,363 10 0 2,435 0 0 School Board for London 18,621 19 5 16,911 7 1 Total Precepts issued for £55,324 0 0 £46,583 1 4 Lighting Rate, viz.:— £ s. d. £ s. d Public Lighting and Incidental Works £4,730 0 0 £4,209 9 2 Local Sewer Rate, viz.:— £ s. d. £ s. d.

General Rate 2 9 in £ 2 7 in £ Lighting „ 0 3 „ 0 4 „ Sewer „ 0 4 „ 0 3 „ 3 4 „ 3 2 „ The increase of 2d in the £ on the General Rate is brought about by the many works and improvements effected by the Vestry during the past year. Wood paving loans being very heavy, the purchase of additional horses anc lolling stock, necessitating greater cartage expenses, &c., in 75 addition to the liabilities of the previous year, which had to be provided for out of this Rate, as well as the large increase in the School Board Rate of nearly £2,200, and thereby causing the issuing of precepts for a larger amount than in 1890-91. The Lighting Rate shows an increase in the amount called for, though the Overseers have been able to reduce the amount by 1d. in the £ on the rates, this is due to the fact that they had a fair balance in hand at the time of making the Rate, and not through any decrease in the lighting of the Parish. The increase in the amount called for on the Sewer Rate is due to the extra sewer works, emptying of cesspools and flushing of sewers and sanitary expenses. The Overseers had not a sufficient balance in hand to keep the rate down to 3d. in the £, as last year, so had to put on an extra 1d. in the £, thus making the net increase on all the local rates for 1891-92 equal to 2d. in the £.

We, the undersigned Auditors of the Accounts of the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham, for the financial year ending 25th March, 1892, hereby certify that we have examined the books of the Vestry, and have compared the vouchers with £. s. d. the cheques, and we find the balance of 6538 2 7 at the Bankers on Current and Deposit Accounts to be correct, and, allowing for the outstanding cheques, amounting to 1369 19 10 the balance to be £5168 2 9 We have also examined the Loan Account of the Vestry, and we find that the loans, including £13,300 borrowed during the year (of which £5,400 will be recouped from the London County Council), amount to £83,780 8 0 We notice with regret that the Vestry are still paying £105 a year for Trafalgar House Stables, which are shut up and unoccupied, and we are of opinion that the place should have been disposed of. We are of opinion that the charges for advertisements are excessive, and that the advertisements inserted by the Vestry in the Builder and Metropolitan papers could be curtailed. We find that the Vestry are still paying for the emptying of cesspools in the Parish, and we concur with last year's Auditors remarks that this amount should be paid by the owners. We notice the sum of £456 17s. 2d. has been spent by the Vestry on printing during the past year, and we are of opinion that a saving could have been effected on this item. We see, on examining the Solicitor's Bills of Costs, that on those bills which have been submitted to taxation a slight saving has been effected, and we strongly recommend that all bills of costs amounting to £20 or upwards should be taxed. We note that £2 10s. a month is paid to an outside Company for cleaning the windows of the Town Hall, and we are of opinion that a man in the parish could be employed at a much less cost. We find that a sum of £1517 2s. 8d. has been paid to Mr. W. Bagley for a dust shoot in the Parish, and we would strongly urge on the Vestry the necessity of finding some other means of disposing of the house refuse. 82 We see with regret that £3,264 4s. 5d. is outstanding on New Streets completed, as against £1,981 8s. last year, and would call on the Vestry to use every endeavour to reduce this amount forthwith; we also notice that £35,175 2s. 7d. was spent on Paving and Sewer Works, as against £12,067 6s. 1d. in the previous year, and that the Incidental Charges Account has been put in a very satisfactory state. We notice that the Permanent Works Account is overdrawn, £7152 0s. 3d, at the Bank, principally owing to the large amounts, viz.:-£11,200 18s. paid for the open space in Crown Road, for which only £5400 loan has been obtained, and that interest on this overdraft has not been charged is owing to the New Streets and other accounts being in credit. With reference to the remarks of last year's Auditors respecting the overdrawn balance of £6162 19s. 3d. on the Town Hall Account, we see with considerable satisfaction that the same has now been paid and the account closed. We have great pleasure in stating that the accounts have been kept in a very satisfactory manner, and must thank Mr. R. H.

NORRINGTON, Assoc. Mem. Inst. C.E. Member of Incorporated Association of Engineers. Surveyor to the Vestry of Fulham. Uestry of the parish of Fulham. SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SURVEYOR, FOR THE YEAR 1891.92. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I beg to present to you my Sixth Annual Report on the works executed by my department, for the year commencing on the 25th of March, 1891, and ending on the 25th of March, 1892. As in my former reports, the corresponding figures for the previous years are retained in the tabulated statements, the tables being far more useful when extending over a series of years. This year many schedules will be found at the end of the Report, as I have reason to believe that their interposition causes some of my observations to be passed over. It is a matter of some regret that notwithstanding the care I have always taken to compile the various tables and statistics in my report, with a view to their being useful to the Vestrymen of this Parish, many of them show by their observations that they have not paid much attention to the report, and ask for returns concerning matters which have been already dealt with. Many of the recommendations in my previous reports have not yet been acted upon, I have therefore decided to repeat them, annually, until they are carried out. Those, therefore, who are acquainted with my previous reports must excuse any repetition that may appear, and I ask their assistance in rendering it unnecessary. AREA OF THE PARISH. The area of the Parish of Fulham is 1,700.324 acres. Area of Foreshore 56.561 „ Area of Tidal Water 99.614 „ Total 1,856.499 COMPARATIVE TABLE. Showing the increase in the population, length of roads, footpaths, &c., of the Parish since the separation from Hammersmith in 1886. The census taken on the 5th day of April, 1891, gave the population at 91,640, being 42.850 males, and 48.790 females. There were also 797 unoccupied houses, and 339 in course of erection. The population at the previous census in 1881 was 42,895. 146 Length of Carriageway, Length of Roadway to same. Length of Public Footways where no Carriageway. Estimated Population' Inhabited Houses.

The reduction of these estimates is, in my opinion, very injurious in its effects, as the Vestry is often without any granite in stock, and the roads consequently get into a bad condition before any repairs can be attended to, instead of being continuously and thoroughly maintained. Members of the Vestry should also note that 93 roads required to be maintained with macadam, instead of only 24 as in 1886. If an arrangement was made with the Contractors to supply a good stock of granite in the summer months, when freights are low, it is possible that a great saving in price—which has increased in recent years from 10s. 8d. to 14s. 4d.—might be effected. 147 There is a continual and enormous increase of traffic in the district, especially of omnibuses, both the principal companies running great numbers through the Parish, besides having several large stables in it. ASPHALTE AND TAR PAYING. Farm Lane was asphalted with 2.in. compressed asphalte on 6.in. of Portland cement concrete, by the French Asphalte Company, at a cost of £1,088 10s. 9d., including the restoring the paving of the side walks. The area was 1539 square yards, and the cost 14s. per yard super. The London Road Car Company contributed £210 4s. 3d. for the portion of this work in front of the entrance to their stables, and dedicated the piece of land paved to the public. No tar paving was done during the year, and the only other asphalte required was for repairs to trenches made by the Gas and Water Companies. FLINTS. Date. Cubic Yards. Cost per Yard. Total Cost.

It is a pity that the Australian woods, Karri and Jarrah, cannot be introduced into this country at lower rates, as then they would, in my opinion, entirely supersede deal block paving. The Fulham Road, from Stamford Bridge to “The George,“ Walham Green, is now in a very bad condition, and requires to be entirely re.laid. About 562,500 blocks will be required for the work. The Vestry might have this number delivered on the road at a certain date, and then carry out the work of re.laying with our own workmen. The blocks being delivered beforehand would prevent any delay in the work. Alternative tenders might be obtained for creosoted deal, Karri and Jarrah blocks. Some discucsion took place during the year among the members of the Vestry as to the relative desirability of using creosoted or plain deal blocks, and certain questions having been submitted to me to answer, I made the following report, which was submitted to and approved by the Vestry: — Town Hall, 21st October, 1891. REPORT ON WOOD PAVING IN REPLY TO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED. I beg to report that creosoted deal blocks, 9.in. by 5.in. by 3.in., can be obtained for £6 17s. 6d. per 1,000, and plain deal blocks the same size for £5 pei.1,000. 149 As there are about 40 blocks to the square yard, the difference in price per yard amounts to Is. 6d. The area of the wood paving Fulham Road is 20,073 square yards, and if plain deal blocks had been used, an apparent saving of about £1,505 9s. 6d. would have resulted. The area of the wood paving North End Road is 7,309, and plain deal blocks would have cost £548 3s. 6d. less. The ccst of superintending the cutting and the creosoting the wood blocks for the Fulham Road amounted to £56 19s. lOd. The cost of ditto ditto North End Road £35 2s. 6d. None of this cost of superintendence was caused by using creosoted blocks, as in any case an Inspector would have had to be present when the cutting took place, to select the timber and reject unsound blocks. 143,141 blocks were rejected, of those cut for the Fulham Road (800,000 required), and 73,772 out of 290,000 required for North End Road. Durability and Relative Cost. Having now answered the questions, I wish to point out that, although the first cost of creosoted deal blocks is greater than plain deal, I am of opinion that creosoted wood is by far the cheapest in the end, and I believe the Committee would be obliged to admit the correctness of my opinion if they would visit the wood paving at the junction of the two Parishes of Hammersmith and Kensington, at Addison Road Bridge. The creosoted wood paving on the Kensington side was laid in May, 1886, and Mr. Weaver, the Surveyor to the Kensington Vestry, writes me “That it was laid at the same time as plain wood in the Hammersmith Road adjoining, and not a penny for repairs has yet been spent on this length of wood.“ This creosoted paving appears now, after over 5½ years wear, as sound as when first laid. The Hammersmith side of the bridge is very much out of repair and requires now to be relaid.* It is evident, therefore, that the creosoted deal blocks in this particular instance will outlast the plain deal by at least three years. Assuming, therefore, that the Fulham Road, where the traffic is similar to the Hammersmith Road, if laid with plain deal would have lasted 5½ years and have cost £8,729 10s. 6d.; the amount of the cost divided over 5½ years, inclusive of interest and repayment, would amount to £1,785 a year. The actual cost of the creosoted blocks amounted to £10,235, and if that amount is divided over the probable period of duration, viz.:. 8½ years, the paving will have cost, inclusive of repayment and interest, only £1,417 a year, or £368 less per annum than plain deals. There is, however, a still more important feature than that of cost, viz: the great superiority of creosoted deal blocks over plain deal for sanitaiy reasons, and without writing a long report on this question, I think it will be sufficient if I quote the following extracts from a letter which appealed in the City Press on October 7th, 1891 :— *The Hammersmith side has since been re.laid with Jarmah wood blocks. 150 “There has been much discussion as to the healthiness of wood “paving and with a view to obtain more information on this subject, I “obtained fair average samples from four different streets, and submitted “them to Dr. Sedgwick Saunders, the Medical Officer and Public “Analyst for the City of London, for analysis and report. He was “good enough to undertake this, and his report is as follows:— “I have examined four samples of wooden pavement blocks marked “respectively 1, 2, 3 and 4, sent by Mr. Deputy Edmeston, of 42, Old “Broad Street, on the 17th July. The blocks were saturated with “organic matter, chiefly urine and horse dung, especially the upper “portions, some were dry and decayed, others wet. Some of the “pieces presented appearances produced by growth of certain fungi. “On two pieces, “mould “was plainly visible; indeed, any wood more “or less soaked in street refuse must inevitably contain fungus spores.“ He goes on to say that “the blocks should be well impregnated with tar or chloride of mercury or creosote,” in order to avoid the evils he has pointed out. Harwood Road Wood Paving. On the 16th March, 1892, I reported that if Harwood Road was laid with creosoted deal blocks, a saving of £113 4s. 8d. a year would be effected on the cost of the wood paving alone. Also the road would not be disturbed for 10 years, instead of 6½, and repairs would not be required for at least 7 years, instead of at the end of 4 or 5. In addition to that, the road would always be drier and in better condition; and give off less slop, so that an additional economy would be effected in that respect. The area is 5,650 square yards, which at 12s. for creosoted wood blocks= £3,390 or an annual expenditure of £407 12s. 2d. at 3½ per cent. 5,650 square yards plain deal, at 10s. 6d. =£2,960, or an annual expenditure of £520 16s. l0d. at 3½ per cent. A number of blocks were used during the year for repairs to trenches, and to the Fulham Road already referred to as in a bad condition. STREETS. A list of the streets of the Parish with the lengths of carriageways and footways, and the particulars and average depths of sewers will be found in Schedule II., at the end of the report.

Chairman and Gentlemen. Re Sewers. I beg to report that since my appointment in 1886, the Vestry has received a great number of complaints of smells arising from ventilators of the sewers under the control of the London County Council in this District. Since the above.mentioned date, I do not know of a single instance where the Council has increased the number of ventilators to the sewers, or erected special shafts, with the view of assisting the ventilation. A good many of the complaints of ventilators in the side streets belonging to the Vestry, are, in my opinion, attributable to gases from sewers belonging to the Council escaping through the nearest ventilators in the side streets. The only improvements made in ventilators by the County Council have been one at the urgent request of the Vestry, when a larger ventilator was placed in the King's Road, at the entrance to Crondace Road, and I believe some larger ventilators have been placed in Dawes Road. 154 surcharging of sewers. The surcharging of the sewers in times of heavy rain, complained of in my report of 1887, has still continued at frequent intervals, and there does not appear to have been any special effort on the part of the Council to reduce it; for instance, the complaints which have reached me of flooding in cellars on Sunday week last, the 19th July, shows the water in the sewers to have been at about the same level as in 1886. Dawes Road Sewer. This sewer also appears to especially require the attention of the County Council. It is known as the low level sewer, and passes through the Dawes Eoad, draining a very large portion of Hammersmith. I have, from time to time, had to make connections to it, and on almost every occasion it has seemed to be surcharged, and has frequently caused the trenches to be flooded; for instauce, on the 26th inst., the water from it backed up to the first manhole in a sewer being constructed in Colehill Lane, a distance of 2,400 feet from the Dawes Road; the water showed a rise of 13 feet 6 inches, and a head of 9 feet 6 inches above the top of the Dawes Road sewer. These facts point to the advisability of the London County Council, 1st.—Providing additional ventilation to the sewers in the district. 2nd.—Enlarging some of them, especially that in Dawes Eoad. 3rd.—Preventing the surcharging of the sewers of the district. In consequence of this report I was instructed to write the following letter to the London County Council. Dear Sir, 28th November, 1891. I am directed by the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham to ask you to lay the following information before the Main Drainage Committee:— On the 11th November, the Claybrooke Eoad sewer was surcharged so that the water rose 3 feet in the manholes. This was due to the surcharging of the low level sewer, which passes through Fulham Palace Eoad and Dawes Eoad. This sewer was charged to within 13 feet of the surface of the roadway, or about 8 feet above the crown of the sewer. It was also found that the ventilator in the Fulham Palace Eoad at the end of the Claybrooke Eoad sewer was stopped up, so that the ventilator in Claybrooke Eoad acted as a ventilator to the Fulham Palace Eoad sewer. Acting under the instructions of the Vestry, I wrote you on the 30th July last, calling the attention of the Council to the inadequacy of this low level sewer, and stating that on the 26th July the sewer was surcharged to the height of 9 feet 6 inches above the crown, causing the Colehill Lane sewer, belonging to the Vestry, and situate at a distance of 2,400 feet, to be surcharged. You replied to that letter on the 5th October, stating “the Council's Officers did not remember any flooding of houses, “and that under existing conditions the capacity of the sewer appears to be sufficient.“ With respect to the flooding of houses, I beg to inform you that shortly after my appointment in 1886, I received a complaint of certain basements of the houses in the Broadway, Walham Green, being 155 flooded to a depth of 6 inches; since that date I have received repeated complaints of these cellars being flooded, and on the 19th July last they were again flooded to about the same level. I have also received complaints of flooding of cellars of houses in Hatfield Street out of Field Road. With respect to the capacity of the sewer, I beg to state that the low level sewer in this district is surcharged at every heavy rainfall. It is manifest that when such surcharging takes place, the subsi. sidence of the sewage in the sewers of the district must be very gradual (I have been informed that it has taken 10 hours to raise the sewage from the low level into the high level sewers), and that such very gradual subsidence must lead to large deposits of solid matter in the sewers. The statements contained in this letter my Vestry consider indisputable, and it consequently fails to see that the Council can consider either the capacity of the sewers in the Parish, or the pumping power at the Victoria pumping station adequate. This Vestry further trusts that your Council will give this matter the serious consideration which its importance merits, especially having regard to the enormous growth of this and neighbouring parishes. I remain, yours faithfully, (Signed) James P. Norrington, a.m.i.c.e., H. De la Hooke, Esq., Surveyor to the Vestry. Clerk to the Council. To the letter of the 28th of November, the Vestry received the following reply, but, the relief of the sewers referred to in the reply is not of the permanent and adequate character required, and it will be the duty of the Vestry to continue to urge the Council to effectually remedy the defects referred to in my letter. Sir Spring Gardens, S.W., 19th January, 1892. The Council has considered your letter of the 28th November last, drawing attention, by direction of the Vestry of Fulham, to the occasional flooding of the basements of certain houses near the Claybrooke Road and Colehill Lane sewers in the Parish of Fulham. In reply, I am directed to state that from information obtained by the officers of the Council, it appears that the surface level of a considerable area of the Parish of Fulham through which the Council's low level sewer passes, is only about 15 feet above Ordance datum or 2 feet 6 inches above Trinity high.water mark, whilst the maximum level attained by the water in the low level and local sewers during times of heavy rainfall seems to have been about 6 feet, leaving an unflooded margin of 9 feet below the surface for the depth of cellars and basements in the area referred to. The interception of the Ranelagh Sewer by the proposed new sewer for the relief of the northern middle level line will, the Engineer reports, divert a considerable quantity of storm water from the low level sewer in question, at a point above the western pumping station, and this relief will be equivalent to a proportionate increase in the plimping capacity of that station. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, The Surveyor of the (Signed) H. DE LA HOOKE, Vestry of Fulham. Clerk of the Council. 156 Since my appointmen, up to 3rd August, 1891, 121 large ventilating man hole covers have been fixed to the existing sewers in the Parish, exclusiv of those fixed to new sewers and streets taken over, and 7 shafts have bee carried up the sides or fronts of houses in order to obtain addition; ventilation to the sewers. DRAINAGE. I am glad to report that the proper construction of the drainage of house has occupied a great deal of the attention of the Vestry during the year All plans of drainage submitted for approval have been most carefull considered, improved methods have been adopted, and the supervision ha been much increased. New drains are now subjected to the water test, an are not allowed to be covered in unless perfectly watertight. On the 29th July, 1891, the Vestry appointed a sub.committee to conside the existing regulations of the Vestry relating to the drainage of houses but, up to the present, no new ones have been approved. This work is of very great importance, and should not longer be delayed Drawings illustrating the best methods of constructing drains should also be circulated in connection with the regulations. I beg to repeat the recommendations I have made in my previous annual reports, viz.:— 1st. That the drains of all new houses should be tested, and certificate of their efficiency, signed by the Surveyor to th Vestry, should be given to the owner before any house i“ occupied. 2nd. That it should be an offence for an owner to allow a house to be occupied until he can produce such official certificate. 3rd. That additional Inspectors be appointed so as to enable this won to be carried out. As such a certificate would be of great value to the owner of a property it is only reasonable that a charge should be made for it, so as to cover the cost of the extra staff required to carry out the work, and as a considera tion for the increased responsibility thrown on the officials of the Vestry. A list of the plans for the drainage of houses submitted to the Vestry will be found in Schedule III., at the end of the report. The number of new buildings proposed to be erected in the parish, for which plans have been submitted are given in the following Table. NEW BUILDINGS. Plans have been submitted for the drainage of new buildings, &c., a follows:— 1888.9. 1889.0. 1890.1. 1891.2. 571 1002 920 969 Houses and Shops 2 - 1 5 Manufactories 1 2 - 4 Chapels 3 2 3 5 Schools 8 6 6 18 Stables 1 - 2 4 Hotels - - 1 - Infirmary 1 4 19 14 Miscellaneous 587 1016 952 1018 157 To cover the cost of the 596 connections to the buildings set forth above, different sums, amounting to £1,082 15s. 0d., have been passed over to the accountant through this Department. For unstopping drains 8 different sums, amounting to £37 10s. 0d., have been passed over to the Accountant. DUST. The disposal of the dust of Loudon is probably one of the most important and troublesome questions which have to come under the consideration of the various Vestries and District Boards. On the 7th October, 1891, a Sub.Committee was appointed to consider it with reference to this Parish, a great number of schemes were considered, and the works of other Boards and Vestries viewed. No definite conclusion has yet boon arrived at, but the general feeling seems to be favourable to the purchase of some of the waste low lying land adjoining the River, about Barking, and barging the dust to it. On the 1st of March, 1892, I made a long report rather favourable to the purchase of 25 acres of land which was offered to the Vestry, at £160 per acre, but the opportunity of purchasing it at that price was allowed to slip. The Vestry have also had under consideration the question of buying some land in the Parish, adjoining the River, suitable for a wharf, but have ' not yet come to any definite conclusion, and I strongly caution the Vestry against delaying this matter, as many sites which are suitable, and can now be obtained at moderate prices, will soon be acquired by private persons. The Vestry have already lost the chance of buying some of the most favourable sites. PUBLIC HEALTH ACT AND REMOVAL OF REFUSE. The Public Health Act (London), 1891, has caused a very important alteration to be made in the collection of the dust in London. Section 30, makes it the duty of the Sanitary Authority “to secure the due removal of house refuse, &c.,” “at proper periods,” and imposes (in sub.section 2) a penalty of £20 on a Sanitary Authority for failing to comply with this obligation. It further provides (in sub.section 3) that if any person in the employ of the Authority, demands any fee or gratuity for the removal of refuse he shall be liable to a fine of 20s. In order to conform with these requisitions the Parish has been divided into six districts, and each district is now, as far as possible being cleared weekly on a certain day in the week. It is not an easy matter to warrant that these days shall be strictly adhered to, because the work of the men is interrupted when it rains persistently and heavy snow falls. It is also curious to note how the quantity of house refuse diminishes in the summer and increases in the winter, so that the number of gangs of dustmen employed, have to be varied in order to conform to the days fixed for the clearance of the dust in the various districts. 158 It is satisfactory to note that the number of complaints of non.clearance of dust has considerably diminished (see below). TRADE REFUSE. The Vestry only charges 2s. 6d. a load for removal of trade refuse. This is not at all sufficient, as the men receive Is. 9d. a load, the cost of barging is 2s. 3d. a load, and the cost for horse and cart is about 3s. a load, making the total cost 7s. I have called the attention of the Cartage Committee to this matter but no alteration has been made. Table showing the number of loads removed :— Year. Loads. Horses, one day cach.

Very considerable attention is necessarily given to this matter, and the increased length of wood.pavements has considerably helped to improve the appearance of the streets in this district. 159 The Vestry employ for this work 70 scavengers, 41 horses and carts, 4 sweeping machines, 4 road scrapers, 12 orderly hand.carts, and 5 sanding machines. The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, has thrown on the Local Authorities the responsibility for cleansing the footpaths, which has necessitated an increase in the number of scavengers employed. Great inconvenience is caused by the practice of the large bus companies changing horses in the public streets, and it is very unfavorable to cleanliness. I have seen as many as eight pairs of horses at a time about Jerdan Place, either just taken out of busses or waiting to be attached. SLOPPING. Vestry's Horses. Hired Horses. Total. No. of Loads.

The Vestry of the Parish has maintained its reputation for the rapidity with which the falls of snow are dealt with. The horse scrapers and sweeping machines are turned out immediately a fall commences, and by 160 sweeping the snow from the main thoroughfares before it is trodden down and hardened, greatly assist in keeping the wood.paved carriageways clear. Public Health (London) Act, and Removal of Snow. Section 29 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which compels the Local Authorities to remove snow from the footpaths, and relieves the occupier of the adjoining premises of the responsibility (imposed on him by Sec. 63, of 57 Geo. 3, c. 29) for clearing snow from the footpath in front of his premises, has not been found to work satisfactorily, and resulted, on one occasion, in the pavements being covered with ice nearly an inch in thickness. The snow fell and was immediately caked, in a half.thawed condition, on the pavements by being trodden under.foot; a rapid fall of temperature took place immediately after this, and before the workmen of the Vestry had a chance of giving their attention to the footpaths, the main thoroughfares necessarily receiving their first attention, the snow had changed into solid sheets of ice, and could not be removed except by applying salt, a method which is considered very dangerous and objection. able. Had each householder swept in front of his house immediately the snow fell, this unfortunate and very dangerous state of things could not have happened. Year. Extra Wages Paid. Loads of Snow Removed.

On the 1st July, 1891, the Vestry ordered the main roads in the Parish to be watered on the Sunday mornings, a practice which had been stopped by a previous Vestry. There is also other work which I should be glad to receive orders to continue on the Sundays, viz., the work of the Street Orderlies, in the more important thoroughfares. The omnibus traffic in this Parish is so heavy that the main thoroughfares become in a state of nuisance before the end of the Sunday, especially in warm weather. TOTAL COST OF CARTAGE.

The Vestry does not exercise the amount of control over the work of laying out streets not taken to by the Vestry as the Act authorises. The obligation is quite as strong on the person laying out a street, to properly hoard in his materials, as if the work was being done in a street repairable by the Vestry. Sec. 124, 18 and 19 Vic., cap. 120, provides that proper piecautions shall be taken, and the directions of the Vestry complied with 167 when laying out or building in a new street, The Vestry has during the year granted licenses to persons building in these streets at a nominal charge of Is. On the 19th February, 1892, a builder was fined 20s. and costs for not removing a hoarding at the expiratiou of his license. TREES. Schedule VI. gives a list of trees belonging to the Vestry and planted in the streets in the Parish. HORSES AND FODDER. Particulars of the horses owned by the Vestry, and the cost of fodder will be found in Schedules VII. and VIII. The cost of keeping horses has considerably risen during the last 3 years, and the great difference in the figures caused me to carefully dissect the prices of fodder, and compare them with previous years. I find that in 1890, Oats were 19/- and 20/3 a quarter; in 1892, 21/- and 22/6 Hay „ 63/- „ 67/- „ „ 72/- „ 103/- Clover „ 67/6 „ 79/- „ „ 85/- „ 110/- Four of our horses were exhibited at the London Horse Parade on the 18th of May, and received 1 first and 2 second prizes. STABLES AND WORKSHOPS. The Vestry purchased a number of additional horses in June, so now the stables are nearly full, there being on an average 41 horses, the accommodation being for 44 with 4 loose boxes additional. The requirements of the Parish are extending so rapidly, that it will soon be advisable to re-occupy Trafalgar House, or to build additional stabling. During the year a large number of new carts have been constructed in the workshops, and are found to be very satisfactory in workmanship and the quality of materials used. WHARF, OLD TOLL HOUSE, SITE. The work of constructing the river wall at this site and paving, &c., was completed early in 1891, at a total cost of £2,100 lis. 9d., and it forms a very convenient and well situated wharf. The area is, however, not large enough for the requirements of the Parish. A boundary wall was also built at a cost of £71 17s. lOd. A steam travelling crane to raise 3 tons costing £395 has been purchased and is very useful for emptying materials, &c., out of the barges alongside. TOWN HALL. The duty of looking after any repairs or works that may be required at the Town Hall and attending the Committee has naturally fallen upon me, and I find that it has required a very large amount of personal attention. 168 During the past year additional gas-fittings has been purchased from Messrs. Verity at a cost of £71 14s., some slight improvements have been carried out at a cost of £45 16s. 8d. A lightning conductor has been fixed at a cost of £50 10s. 8d., and the Hall Keeper's rooms ventilated at a cost of £4 15s. 6d. MORTUARY. The London County Council has refused an application which was made for a loan to cover the cost of the Mortuary and Coroner's Court, erected by the Vestry in the Fulham Palace Road in 1889. FULHAM RECREATION GROUND. This piece of land, situate at the corner of Crown Road and Fulham Palace Road, was offered to the Vestry by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for the sum of £1,250 per acre. Of this amount the London County Council on the 9th June, agreed to contribute one-half, or £5625. The Vestry further received from the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association a promise to contribute seats and "their utmost towards the expenses of laying out, according to the state of their finances," and the offer of the Commissioners was accepted on the 29th July. The land was taken possession of and the work of laying out commenced on the 4th March, 1892. The exact area of the land purchased was ascertained by survey to be 8 acres, 2 roods, 29 poles, 23 yards, which at £1,250 per acre, equals £10,587 10s. In addition to this sum the Vestry had to pay £206 14s. 5d. being the value of the iron fence erected by the Commissioners around the ground. INSANITARY AREAS. There are not many areas in Fulham that, from the nature of the construction of the property, can be classed as insanitary. There are, however, one or two isolated rows of cottages in various parts that are not constructed on sanitary principles, but by far the most insanitary habitations in the Parish arc those dwelling-houses situated in mews, and constructed over stables; most of these have no back ventilation whatever. The building regulations for London prevent an ordinary dwellinghouse being constructed without front and back ventilation; yet a person can build stables on the ground floor, call the premises a mews, and several storeys above can be inhabited, although the only light and ventilation to be obtained is from the front over a narrow, and, generally, unclean stable yard. BISHOP'S MEADOW. Negotiations with the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, in reference to the conveyance of Bishop's Meadow and West Meadow to the Vestry, and with the London County Council for the necessary loan to carry out 169 the works required to form these meadows into a Park, have occupied a considerable part of the year, and many technical difficulties have arisen in reference to them. On the 13tli May the Vestry approved the plans which had been prepared for a concrete wall with a brick face, but later on, in June, rescinded their previous resolution, and decided that the wall should be constructed entirely of concrete. On the 9th September the London County Council agreed to contribute £5,000 towards the cost of the work, and I was ordered to proceed with the plans and specifications. On the 18th November various alternatives were submitted to the Committee, and decisive instructions given for the final completion of the plans and specifications, and, in January, the plans were submitted to the London County Council in accordance with the terms of their resolution granting their contribution of £5,000. CROMWELL ROAD BRIDGE. The probabilities of the construction of this proposed Bridge, which is so necessary for the development of the part of Fulham known as West Kensington, do not seem to be more favourable. Negotiations have taken place between the Loudon County Council and the Vestry in reference to the proportion of cost to be paid by the Council, the Vestry, and a betterment rate, for a Bridge, 50 feet wide, with 60 feet wide approaches, and estimated to cost £65,500. It was finally decided that, if the Council paid one-third, the Vestry would pay two-thirds, recoupiug itself as to one-third by a betterment rate, levied on an area in the Fulham District extending half-a-mile from the Fulham end of the Bridge. Application was accordingly made to Parliament by the Council for their sanction to this proposal, which was opposed by the Great Western Railway and the London and North-Western Railway Companies jointly, and an owner of land on the site of the proposed approaches. The Committee of the House of Commons would not sanction the principle of the betterment rate, and the part of the Bill relatiug to the Cromwell Road Bridge was accordingly withdrawn by the Council. The principle of betterment, or "melioration," as it is called by Mr. Samuel Pepys in his diary on the 3rd December, 1667, was admitted and acted upon in the improvements which took place in the City of London after the Great Fire in 1666, and as so many of the owners of property living in West Kensington are perfectly willing to pay it, and admit the Bridge would cause their properties to increase from 10 to 12 per cent, in value, it is somewhat surprising that the Committee should have rejected the Bill. It should be borne in mind by all Local Authorities when Railway Companies are seeking fresh Parliamentary powers for works in their district, that, should a neighbourhood increase so that additional bridges over the line are required, a railway will generally be found a greater obstruction to 170 free access from side to side than a wide river ; and, in every Railway Bill, Local Authorities should insist on power being given them to bridge over the line "whenever, and wherever" it may appear desirable to the authority to do so. LAMMAS LANDS. In consequence of carrying out the instructions the Vestry gave me, on the 1st of December, 1890, and taking six horses over the lands called Town Meadows, adjoining the river, and claimed as Lammas lands in this Parish, actions have been commenced by the owners of these lands against the Vestry for trespass. These actions have, I believe, been consolidated, so that only one case will really be tried, but up to the period embraced by this Report, March, 1892, nothing very definite, with respect to them has occurred. ELECTRIC LIGHT. An application was made for a provisional order by the Putney and Hammersmith Electric Power Supply Company, Limited, to supply the Electric Light in this district, but, on the Vestry declaring their intention to oppose, the Company abandoned their application. % EXCAVATIONS ON THE SITE OF PROPOSED ROADWAYS. Regulations of a striugeut character have been framed by the Vestry, under Sec. 6, 53 and 54 Vict., chap. 66, of the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1890, controlling excavations for the purpose of removing sand and ballast from the site of proposed new streets. The result of the regulations has been to practically stop the practice. LONDON BUILDING LAW (CONSOLIDATION) BILL. A Bill with the above title was forwarded to this Vestry by the President of the Local Government Board, in August, 1891, and the following is my report concerning it:— 16th September, 1891. To the Chairman and Members of the Works Committee. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen. Be London Buildings Consolidation Bill. The object of this Bill is to consolidate the Metropolitan Building Acts, and for that purpose it is proposed to repeal a number of sections of the 7th and 8th Vic., cap. 84, 18 and 19 Vic., cap. 122, 23 and 24 Vic., cap. 52, 24 and 25 Vic., cap. 87, 32 and 33 Vic., cap. 82, 41 and 42 Vic., cap. 32, 45 and 46 Vic., cap. 14, 53 and 54 Vic., cap. 143. Part I. relates to the regulations and supervision of buildings. The clauses generally, do not call for any special comment, they being nearly the same as those repealed. Clause 14 provides that arches under public ways shall be a certain thickness and to the satisfaction of the District Surveyor. It appears to me that it might also require that before such arch is constructed, plans are to be submitted to and approved by the Local 171 Authority, and that the work should be carried out to the satisfaction of the Surveyor to that Authority, especially as the Local Authority is responsible for the repair and maintenance of the footpaths. Clause 15, which proposes to allow shop fronts to project 5-in. and 10-in., ought to be objected to and the projection of cornices only ought to be allowed and limited to 12 inches. The other parts of the Bill relate to— Part II.—Party structures. Part III.—Dangerous and neglected structures. Part IV.—Various supplemental provisions. The Bill practically carries out the expressed object, and does not, as it at present stands, affect the Vestry, except in those particulars I have called special attention to. I am, however, of opinion that the method of control over buildings, which it is proposed to perpetuate by the Bill, is not at all satisfactory, inasmuch as it continues the present practice of the joint superintendence of buildings by the District Surveyors, for the thickness of walls, etc., and the Surveyor to the Local Authority, for drainage, lines of frontages, &c. The District Surveyors are not in the least degree responsible to, or under the supervision or control, of the Local Authority, and do not report to them, but to a central Authority, which has very little local knowledge or means of knowing what takes place in the various Districts. The Surveyors to the Local Authority are of course directly under the control of persons with local knowledge. The result is that two sets of Surveyors, acting for different Authorities, have from time to time to inspect one building,—and persons building have to submit sets of plans, and receive the approval of both these Authorities. This system causes unnecessary trouble, mistakes, and sometimes hardship. The Builders having perhaps been told by the District Surveyor that their plans are satisfactory, suddenly find themselves called upon to submit plans to the Vestry, and that the Vestry are not satisfied, and vice versa. London is peculiar in this respect, for wherever the Public Health Act governs the action of the Local Authority, one set of Bye-laws applies both to the construction of the buildings and the drainage ; and of course also only the one Surveyor is responsible for the proper supervision and execution of the work. I have had experience of the system which exists in the large Towns of England, and in my opinion it is far preferable to the London one, and I suggest that the offices of the Surveyor to the Vestry and District Survoyors should be combined, and that the Bill should make provision for such an amalgamation as vacaucies occur. I remain, yours faithfully, JAMES P. NORRINGTON, A.M.I.C.E., Surveyor to the Vestry. PUBLIC HEALTH LONDON ACT, 1891. This is one of the most important Acts affecting the Government of London, passed for some years. The various clauses concerning the collection of refuse, cleansing of streets, and removal of snow, &c., have 172 already been referred to in my report, under the various headings relating to these works. The Act came into force in January, 1892, and the Vestry, on the 21st day of October, 1891, at my request ordered additional plant, and gave instructions which enabled the new obligations imposed by the Act, to be provided for. Important powers are given by this Act to make Bye-laws regulating various matters which were reported on in February, 1892, as follows :— I have carefully gone through the Public Health Act, 1891, and find that powers are given by that Act to make Bye-laws or regulations on the following subjects affecting my department :— Sec. 16, authorizes the Vestry to make bye-laws for the prevention of nuisances arising from snow, ice, salt, dust, ashes, rubbish, litter, &c., in any street. Also for preventing any nuisance arising from offensive matter running out of any factory, &c., into auy uncovered place, also as to paving of yards, &c., in connection with any dwelling houses. Sec. 39, provides that the L.C.C. shall make bye-laws with respect to W.C's. Sec. 45, provides that the Sanitary Authority shall make bye-laws with respect to public sanitary conveniences. Sec. 94, provides that the Sanitary Authority shall make bye-laws with respect to lodging houses. The draft bye-laws, submitted by the Local Government Board, have reference to snow, ice, &c., laying litter in streets, preventing any nuisance arising from offensive matter issuing out of any workshop or factory, as to paving of yards, and with respect to W.C's. I have carefully examined the bye-laws, and have amended that having reference to the deposit of litter in streets by providing that each person requiring to deposit straw, &c., shall obtain the sanction of and pay a deposit to the Yestry, before laying same, to cover cost of clearing it away. The bye-laws with respect to the paving of yards or open spaces in connection with dwellings, are, in my opinion, imperfect and arbitrary, inasmuch as it compels owners of property to pave any open space in connection with a dwelling house, even though it may be used as a garden. I have already heard of cases (uot in this Parish) in which Sanitary Authorities have compelled pieces of ground to be paved, that had always been used as a front or back garden. ACTS OF PARLIAMENT. Two other Acts affecting the powers of local authorities were passed in 1891, as follows:— An Act to enable the Urban authorities to provide and maintain museums and gymnasiums (54 and 55 Vic., chap 22), also An act to Provide for control of and regulation of overhead wires in the County of London (54 and 55 Vic. chap 77). 173 IMPROVEMENTS where land is given up.

The Vestry made an offer which was not accepted by the trustees, for the site of the St. John's National School, Walham Green. The intention was to effect some improvements in the Broadway and vanston Place. Other improvements will be found in Schedule IX. Applications for Loans, Contracts, List of Stock.

All these (with very few exceptions), are held in the evening, and the number and great length of them is a severe strain on those officials who have to be in attendance. STAFF. Various changes have taken place in the staff of my department. On the 25th September, 1891, Mr. F. W. J. Palmer, who had been AssistantSurveyor since March, 1886, obtained the appointment of Surveyor to the Local Authority at Heme Bay. He left with high class references, having earned the esteem and goodwill of the Vestry and his brother officers. Mr. Charles Botterill, the Chief Out-door Assistant, succeeded him as Assistant-Surveyor, and Mr. A. J. Webb, Clerk of Works, succeeded Mr. Botterill. The vacancy caused by these promotions was filled on the 24th of November. 174 CONCLUSION. I have again to call the attention of the Vestry to the following matters requiring more or less urgent attention. (1.) The construction of the Cromwell Road Bridge. (2.) The favorable settlement of the Lammas Rights. (3.) The permanent relief from surcharging of the sewers of the district. (4.) The provision of a large and suitable wharf. (5.) The improvements of the approaches to the Parish over StanleyBridge, Stamford Bridge, Lillie Bridge, to the junction of North End Road and Hammersmith Road. (6.) The repaving of Fulham Road, from Stamford Bridge to ,, The George.'' (7.) The various widenings of the North End Road. (8.) Do. do. Fulham Road. (9.) The widening of Bagley's Lane. (10.) The relief of the various thoroughfares from the nuisance and obstruction caused by the practice of the Omnibus Companies changing horses in the streets. I have again the pleasure of expressing great satisfaction with the Officials in my department, Mr. William P. Jones, the Superintendent of Roads; Mr. F. W. J. Palmer, the Assistant Surveyor; Mr. Charles Botterill, who succeeded him; Mr. J. A. Webb, Chief Clerk of Works, and Mr. D. S. Matthews, Junior Assistant, and I desire to thank them for their able assistance. I also beg to repeat my thanks to many of the other officials and members of the Vestry for their co-operation, assistance, and courtesy during the year.

New Streets Surveyor's Department, Town Hall, Walham Green. May, 1892. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I beg to present my Third Annual Report on matters connected with this department for the year ending 25th March, 1892. During the year 460 summonses have been issued for amounts due for apportionments; the following of which have been contested:- BISHOP'S ROAD. The summons was issued to recover the estimated expenses of paving Bishop's Road, Section I., as a new street; the summonses having been heard on the 21st October, 1890. The Magistrate held, as a matter of fact, that Bishop's Road became a new street in the year 1880, and that since Bishop's Road became a new street the late District Board had permanently paved the carriageway, the Vestry had therefore exhausted their powers, and accordingly dismissed the summons. The Vestry appealed on this decision, and the Superior Court was of the opinion that there was evidence before the Justices that the Vestry had permanently paved the carriageway of the road since it became a new street, and accordingly dismissed the appeal with costs. CROWN STREET. These summonses were issued to recover the estimated expenses of paving Crown Street which is about 20 feet in width. It was proved and admitted in evidence that the street was not of the full width of 40 feet, and was not open to carriage traffic at both ends. The Magistrate reserved judgement intimating that it would be delivered in favour of the Vestry, but that he would grant a special case should the defendants require one. SEAGRAVE ROAD. These summonses were contested on the Surveyor's Estimate, The defendant contended that the Vestry were not entitled to charge five per cent for incidental expenses, but the Magistrate overruled this objection and made an order for the sum claimed. ROADS COMPLETED. The past year has been one absolutely unprecedented in Fulham for the number of roads completed, which has been 52 as against 22 last year, for which £26,468 3s. 5d. has been paid, which is equivalent to 12s. 3½d. per foot of effective frontage as against £9,948 10s. 3d. or 10s. per foot last year. 206 WORK OF DEPARTMENT. It is now about 2½ years since the formation of this Department which had its commencement in a small room at Berwick House without either furniture or instruments. A commencement was made by myself, on the 29th September, 1889, with a drawing board on two tressles, and with the use of my own instruments. Subsequently two assistants were appointed, and gradually instruments and necessary articles were obtained to make the plans and apportionments. The work increased daily until we were presenting 9 and 10 plans every Committee. By various stages the work progressed until our first road was advertised for in January, 1891, and at almost every Vestry subsequently 3, 4 and sometimes 8 and 9 roads were advertised for, so that the work of making plans and apportionments, and the making up of the roads went on simultaneously from this date. The whole of the work of the New Streets' Department was carried on in this one room until we removed into our present offices at the Town Hall which now admit of the work being carried on with greater ease and expedition. Our commencement although small, has developed, and we are now an important department, spending, during the last year, £26,468. Since our formation as a separate department no less than 111 plans and apportionments have been sealed in duplicate. CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO. During the past year 37 plans and apportionments have been sealed, and 52 roads have been completed, representing 4½ miles in length, in which the following quantities of materials have been used:- 283,536 Superficial feet of paving 31,504 Feet cube of kerb 33,315 Loads of earth excavated 21,002 Loads of hard core 7,000 Loads of gravel 5,250 Loads of flints 47,256 Feet run of channelling With a total area of 21½ acres of finished roadway, and taking the average annual rainfall at 25 inches, this would give an additional volume of about twelve and a quarter millions of gallons of surface water added to the Metropolitan sewage. This affords a good opportunity of drawing the attention of the London County Council to the fact of the flooding that constantly takes place during storms, and to the necessity of affording some relief to over-charged sewers during such periods. As Fulham is gradually developed and the streets paved and drained, the volume of surface water turned into the sewers, will, I think, prove that the sewers are absolutely inadequate in size to take away the volume of sewage and water turned into them. This also opens up another question of some importance as to whether it would not be practicable to form Fulham into districts on the separate system, and drain their surface waters by gravitation into the Thames, and so save the reconstruction of a great part of the Metropolitan system, and having regard to the fact that the whole of the Metropolitan sewage is now treated chemically, such a scheme would save this annual expenditure for treatment of the surface water of this district. 207 ADDITIONAL APPORTIONMENTS.

CONSTRUCTION OF NEW STREETS. In accordance with Bye-laws made by the late Metropolitan Board of Works, all persons intending forming or laying out new streets are required to give four weeks written notice, stating the proposed level and width, &c. The requirements of the Board are that all streets intended for carriage traffic, shall be 40 feet in width exclusive of any gardens, forecourts, open areas, or other spaces, and every such street shall have two entrances of the full width. 211 The system that obtains in Fulham, is to lay out a street in a temporary manner if necessary, defining the width of the footway by a kerb, and making up the roadway with gravel or some other such material; it is never the practice to permanently pave a road when it is first laid out. According to the deposited plans, roads are required to be laid out to some definite and stated gradient, and to fall evenly from point to point; such may have been the case when first laid out, but when building operations commence, levels are regarded as of no consequence, as a result of which two steps contiguous often vary in level as much as 6 inches and such a case came under my observation the other day. The irregularity of these steps has caused endless trouble and inconvenience and even serious deterioration to the property when the streets are permanently paved, as it is impossible to set out a uniform line and level of kerb, so as to keep below the lowest of these steps without giving its neighbour an extremely high step which, in many cases, would be very dangerous to persons entering. It is therefore necessary to alter and vary the levels to meet, uniformly, these steps, this has frequently to be done to such an extent as to deprive the road of the appearance it should possess and in some cases it scarcely falls short of the resemblance to a Switchback Railway. Such a state of things is not only damaging to the appearance of the road but causes gullies to be constructed where they could otherwise have been dispensed with, and altering and varying gradients are also unpleasant and at times dangerous to vehicular traffic. I therefore think that an officer should be appointed to supervise this work and to see that the buildings are erected with a uniform rate of fall from point to point, this would add considerably to the appearance of the roads. It would obviate the danger to persons entering houses where in some cases the steps have to be buried, and in other cases where they are left standing considerably above the pavement; in the former case there is a step down to the house, and in the latter a step up, which is far preferable when not excessive. STREETS PAVED. A great many of the new streets paved during the last year have been those in the poorer parts of Fulham where paving is most needed. I have observed the marked improvement to the district in consequence. Landlords in such a neighbourhood as Caroline Place could take no interest in their property, whilst the approach to it was almost an impassable quagmire, there was no inducement to improve that property to command better tenants until the road had been paved. During the past year this has been done with Imperial Stone, and it now presents a clean and cheerful appearance, as a result of which the whole of the property has been renovated and considerably improved. Such improvements as these not only contribute to the healthiness and appearance of the Parish, but educate the poorer classes to be cleanly; the first step therefore in this direction is to pave. No woman, however hard she may work, however industrious, or however clean and tidy, would take the same interest in her house if the approaches were dirty as she would if they were clean. 212 I have watched carefully, this year, the effect of streets paved in the poorer neighbourhoods, and I am quite convinced that the work of this Department has advanced socially and morally the people living in these Districts, I therefore think it is our duty, as the Sanitary Authority, to carry on this work. There are still a great number of streets unpaved more especially those which add to the insanitary condition of the Parish such as mews, courts, alleys and passages. Our attention in the past has mostly been directed to the main roads and the new streets proper, but there is no reason why this Department should not remove the chief cause of uncleanliness and unhealthiness from these narrow places and make them equal (at least in respect of paving and scavenging) to streets of the full width. I remain, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, W. SYKES.
