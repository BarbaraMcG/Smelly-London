The death-rate of the district during the past year has been 171 per 1,000 of the population. There has been a total of 5,140 recorded in the Parish, of which 2,604 were males and 2,536 females. Of the total deaths, 2,042 cases occurred in the western, and 3,098 in the eastern division of the district. The actual number of deaths this year is rather less than the total number of the previous year. Taking the increase of the population also into account, the death-rate of 17.1 per 1,000 is the lowest to be found upon our Islington records. MORTALITY AT DIFFERENT AGES.

Small-Pox, as will be seen elsewhere, was, for the time, remarkably quiet. The actual mortality in the Parish from this disease was one, and in the Hospitals of the Asylums Board only two deaths of parishioners were recorded. Measles was the disease most severely epidemic during the year, the deaths recorded being 165 as against 153, 161, 48, and 219 in the four previous years. Scarlatina was not so seriously epidemic, the deaths having been only 95 as against 142, 116, 198, 135, 173, 200, 125, 222, and 129 in the previous nine years. During the much more severely epidemic years of 1870,1869, 1863,1862, and 1859 the deaths from scarlatina were respectively 465, 313, 392, 210, and 216. The population of these years were 209,057; 202,182; 166,922; 161,679; and 143,338; as against 301,283 in the year under review. Diphtheria: The deaths certified as having been caused from this disease in the Parish during 1883 were 70, the largest number ever recorded in the course of any one year, the monthly number of deaths ranging from 2 to 9. There is, however, always some little difficulty in determining whether the death has been caused by true Diphtheria, a disease characterised by the presence of a membranous exudation, or the older form of malignant sore throat, which, judging by the returns, seems to have been less fatal since Diphtheria has been recognised as a distinct disease. Whooping-Cough was neither so seriously fatal, nor so prevalent as in the previous year, the 119 deaths attributable to the disease being the lowest on record since 1870. The deaths were 299 both in 1882 and 1880, and 324 in 1869, these numbers being the highest on the records of the Parish. Diarrhoea caused 162 deaths as against 149, 216, and 295 in the three previous years. To Fever generally, 86 deaths were referred, as against 77 and 79 in the two previous years. This is a very satisfactory result, seeing that an exceptional, although happily a circumscribed, outbreak of Typhoid Fever, in August, contributed no less than 25 deaths to the total number. 10 At the time of its occurrence I reported upon this outbreak to your Sanitary Committee to the following effect:— To the Sanitary Committee. Gentlemen, I beg to report in reference to the recent outbreak of Typhoid Fever, which occurred with exceptional severity in St. Pancras, that between the middle of August and the middle of October, 86 cases were recorded as having occurred in various parts of this Parish, Typhoid Fever usually recurring about that time with more or less intensity. Of these 86 cases, 25 were fatal. Seeing, however, that the fatal cases are always heard of at the time of registration, if not previously, whilst the largest number of the cases of illness (and this is especially true of Typhoid Fever) is never heard of at all, it must not be supposed that any direct relationship exists between this mortality and the sickness recorded. This fact will become clearly apparent, when we separate the cases into groups. Forty-one of the 86 cases occurred in 27 dwellings, situated within a comparatively small area in the immediate vicinity of Saint Pancras, and in the neighbourhood of the Cattle Market. Of the remaining forty-five cases scattered over the Parish, 2 were imported directly from Saint Pancras, 2 occurred in persons who worked there, whilst in two others the illness was contracted by persons whose work was near the Cattle Market. 18 of these 45 cases were fatal, and some of them only became known to us after death. Of the 41 cases, 40 occurred in families supplied with milk by a Mr. X., a dairyman, of Saint Pancras, where two of these patients were working, one known case only (which was fatal) having occurred in the Camden-road, in a house deriving its milk supply from another source. Of the 40 cases, 15 occurred in seven houses in the Camden-road, 2 in two honses in Goodinge-road, 1 in Hilldrop Crescent, 1 in Hungerford-road, and 21 in 15 tenements of the Queen's Arms Buildings, one of two blocks of lodging-houses situated in the Cattle Market Area, and belonging to the Corporation of the City. Of the 41 localised cases 7 were fatal, 2 of which were amongst the 21 cases in the Queen's Arms group, where the whole of the cases of sickness could be readily ascertained. 11 The other 5 deaths were amongst the 20 cases in the Cainden-road group (where there were doubtless other cases of illness which, had they become known, would have greatly reduced the apparent death-rate in this group) 2 of these 5 deaths being in one family. I am indebted to a medical practitioner of Camden-town for the first information upon this subject, and to him my best thanks are due for his communications. This outbreak was at first the cause of some anxiety. Happily, the more serious portion was confined to a limited area, and extended only over a short space of time—the 41 cases chiefly occurring during the last two weeks of the month of August, and the first week of September. The outbreak, however, was watched with great care, and both inspection and report were made in every case. Cisterns have been cleansed, sanitary defects have been remedied, and a thorough disinfection has been effected in every case which has come to our knowledge; and in respect to disinfection, I may add, that it has been done in the face of much opposition, many medical men still holding the opinion that Typhoid Fever is not infectious, except within certain defined limits. As regards the causes of the outbreak, the two blocks of lodging-houses recently referred to (each of which contains 63 dwellings or separate tenements) have afforded me the opportunity of testing in a certain limited way the question how far this portion of the outbreak was due to infected Milk. Of the 63 dwellings in the City Arms Buildings, 60 were occupied, 53 of these being supplied with Milk by one dealer not previously mentioned. In 5 Condensed Milk was used, and in 2 the Milk was supplied by other dealers, but in none of these 60 dwellings did any case of Typhoid Fever occur. 57 dwellings in the Queen's Arms Buildings were occupied. Out of these, 23 were supplied with milk by the Mr. X., already referred to, the result being that 21 cases of Typhoid Fever occurred in 15 of these 23 dwellings, only 8 escaping. In respect to the remaining 34 dwellings, where no Typhoid occurred, it was found that 21 derived their Milk supply from other dealers, that in 11 Condensed Milk was used, and that in 2 no Milk was received. There appears, therefore, to my mind, no doubt that that part of the Typhoid outbreak, comprised in the 40 cases located on the borders of Saint Pancras, may reasonably be assumed to have resulted from infected Milk supplied by the Vendor previously called Mr. X. But when, further, we consider the unusual extent of the disease in Saint Pancras, combined with the facts that the earliest cases in point of time are seldom known or traced, 12 also that Typhoid fever had attacked the "Vendor's own household, and that several of the Milk carriers were delivering the Milk whilst suffering from the disease, the cause of the infection of the medium which is believed to have conveyed the disease, appears to me to have been much nearer home than has been supposed. Without, however, the strongest proof, it is not well in such cases to speak too positively. The premises of the Milk Vendor being in the Parish of Saint Pancras, I did not pursue my investigations in this direction beyond our own Parish. I therefore limited my action to the extent of conveying to him at once the fact of the grave suspicion that attached itself to the Milk he was supplying, and in advising him to discontinue his delivery of the Milk for a time, and also to have especial regard to the health of his Milk carriers and other employes, and to investigate immediately the sanitary condition of the sources from which his supply was taken. 31 additional cases of Typhoid Fever have been recorded since the middle of October, but these have happened in different parts of the Parish, and, like most of the other scattered cases, have clearly no relation to the localised outbreak which I have now referred to at some length. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, C. MEYMOTT TIDY, M.B., Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Offices, Upper Street, hth November, 1883. 13 SMALL-POX. During the year 1883, 36 cases only of sickness from Small-pox were recorded in the Parish, as against 142 and 797 in 1882 and 1881 respectively. 19 of the 36 cases were removed to the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylum Board, 3 were admitted upon payment to the Highgate Hospital, and 14 were treated at their own homes. Of the 14 cases that remained in the Parish, 1 died in the Highgate Hospital, that death being included in the Mortality Table attached hereto. Of the 19 cases removed to the Hospitals of the Asylum Board, 2 died. 16 of these 36 cases were recorded during the last six weeks of the year, leaving only 20 as having occurred during the previous 46 weeks. I regret, however, to state that this disease, which had thus remained in such comparative quietude during 1883, has, since February of the present year (1884), again become seriously epidemic, so much so, in fact, that even should there be a temporary abatement during the summer months, there is every indication that at the close of the year we shall be brought face to face with a still severer outbreak of this dreaded disease. The peaceful lull, as I anticipated in my last report, has already been followed by a storm, which I fear will grow in intensity for many months to come. I am sorry that in the prospect of such a probable emergency, I am no longer able to congratulate the Vestry on possessing Camp Hospital Premises, which have (unfortunately, in my opinion) been entirely abandoned. In anticipation of the tenancy terminating, the Vestry, in the early part of the present year, gave instructions for the sale by tender of the tents, furniture, bedding, &c., to Small-pox Hospital Authorities, the amount realised being £380 2s. 6d. The beds and clothing, however, as articles most likely to retain infection, were not sold, but were destroyed by fire upon the premises. The following cases of sickness and of deaths from Small-pox recorded monthly during 1884, will show the progress of the present epidemic in Islington since the beginning of the year. Sickness.

During the twelve months ending December, 1883, I examined 113 samples of food, 112 of which were submitted to me by your Inspectors and 1 by the public. This makes in all 1236 samples of food examined for Islington since my appointment. The 112 samples submitted by your Inspectors consisted of:— 4 Milk 5 Chicory 4 Port Wine 4 Black Tea 4 Gin 3 Moist Sugar 4 Brandy 4 Jam 4 Rum 4 Mustard 4 Whisky 4 Black Pepper 4 Fourpenny Ale 4 Cayenne Pepper 4 Porter 4 Lard 4 Bread 4 Flour 8 Butter 4 Oatmeal 4 Cheese 4 Pickles 4 Arrowroot 4 Sweets 4 Cocoa 4 Lime Juice 4 Coffee Of the 112 samples submitted by your Inspectors I certified 2 samples of Milk to be adulterated with 20 per cent. of added water in each case, and one sample of so-called Butter, I certified as being entirely composed of "OleoMargarine" or purified fat. Summonses were issued, and fines inflicted in these three cases, the particulars of which will be found elsewhere. I have further, in an Appendix attached hereto, published, in extenso, for the information of the Vestry and the public, my four Quarterly Reports as Analyst, together with their accompanying Schedules, and for further details I must refer the reader to these reports. The one sample of food submitted by the public was one of Black Tea received from the Holborn Guardians, which I certified to be genuine. 17 THE MORTUARY AND CORONER'S COURT, 1883. From the 1st January to the 31st December, 1883, 661 bodies were received at the Mortuary, the daily average being 1.81. 371 inquests have been held during the same period, the sum of £56 7s. 6d. having been paid to the Vestry for the accommodation afforded by the Coroner's Court. The proportion of inquests to deaths was about 7.22 per cent. for the whole year. SANITARY WORK OF THE YEAR, 1883—84. Table No. VI. This table of our Sanitary work has been prepared in the usual manner showing in the upper portion the number and variety of the inspections, reinspections, and calls made by the District Inspectors during the year, and in the lower portion the amendments effected. In addition, the District Inspectors have also reported the premises from which they have found removal of dust to be necessary. By the authority of the Sanitary Committee, carbolic acid was again used during the summer months in watering some of the streets. McDougall's Powder was also used in the hottest and driest part of the season in the courts, and in connection with the Sunday morning cleansing of the channels of the Essex, Caledonian, and Holloway roads, where these thoroughfares are used as market-places until late on Saturday night. It will be noted in this table that 626 visits have been made to the Bakehouses in the Parish, the Legislature having during the Parliamentary Session of 1883, by "The Factory and Workshop Act, 1883," re-transferred their inspection from Her Majesty's Inspectors of Factories to the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis. This step will, in my opinion, prove beneficial in every way, but the transference would have been more readily effected by the re-enactment of "The Bakehouses Regulation Act of 1863," than by amending "The Factory and Workshop Act of 1878." 18 THE SLAUGHTER AND COW-HOUSES IN ISLINGTON. 1883—84. At the Annual Licensing of 1883 there were 82 applications for renewal of licences to Slaughter-houses, 81 being granted, and one refused. For the renewal of licences to Cow-houses, 47 applications were made. In one case, the applicant not being in attendance, the licence lapsed, and in a second the licence was refused, the applicant not having kept cows for several years. 81 Slaughter-houses and 45 Cow-houses were therefore licensed. My annual inspection of these places prior to the licensing proved them to be in a satisfactory condition. SUMMONSES. During the year ending the 31st December, 1883, 3 summonses for Adulteration were taken out, by direction of the Sanitary Committee, upon certificates given by me as Public Analyst. The prosecution was successful in each case, the amount of the penalties recovered and paid to the Vestry being £10 10s. In two of these cases I certified that 20 per cent. of water had been added to Milk in excess of that normally present; and in the third case I certified that a sample of so-called Butter consisted entirely of "OleoMargarine," or purified fat. Two other summonses were taken out, under "The Nuisances Removal Acts," for the Abatement of Nuisances arising from foul and defective drainage. In each instance the necessary drainage works were carried out. 19 THE DUSTING OF THE PARISH, 1883—84. I have appended, as usual, a tabulated statement (Table No. VII.) of the applications for the removal of Dust during the year ending Lady-Day, 1884, showing the number received during each quarter from the eight different Wards of the Parish. Of the total number of 13,846 applications received from residents during the year, 9,829 were by letter or postal card, and 4,017 were made personally, or by messengers sent to the Vestry Offices. The 13,846 applications received from inhabitants were at the rate of 35'6 per cent, of the 38,891 assessments in the Parish. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, C. MEYMOTT TIDY, M.B., Medical Officer of Health. 30th June, 1884. TABLE No. V. DEATHS REGISTERED IN ISLINGTON DURING (Deaths of Non-Residents West S.D. East S.D. Causes of Death. At all Ages.
