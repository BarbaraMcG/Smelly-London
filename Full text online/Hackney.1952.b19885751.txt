TOWN HALL, HACKNEY, E, 8 August, 1953 To His Worship the Mayor and to the Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the annual report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1952. This, I am informed, is the 97th Report in a series submitted by Medical Officers of Health to the Hackney Board of Works and the Hackney Borough Council, but it is the first report which I am privileged to write. The first Medical Officer of Health was Dr J. W Tripe, who was appointed under the Metropolis Management Act of 1855 and who held the office from 1856 to 1892. Dr„ Tripe was succeeded by Dr King-Warry, who remained in office until 1919. Dr. W. W. E. Fletcher was appointed Acting Medical Officer of Health for the period 1919-1920, when Dr. G. H. Dart, who resigned on December 31st last year, was appointed. You will be aware that I only took up duty as Medical Officer of Health to this Borough on January 1st of the current year. As I was not in office during the year to which this report relates I naturally find myself in some difficulty in presenting a clear picture of the work of the department throughout 1952, and I would therefore claim your indulgence. The impressions I give are based primarily on the statistics for the year which have been placed before me, but no doubt the picture I present may well be coloured to some extent by the impressions I have gained during the seven or eight months I have been in charge of the Public Health Department.' May I, in the first place, thank everybody for the kindly and generous welcome I have received. The Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee in office when I came, and of the new Committee appointed in May, have been most helpful and encouraging, and that also applies equally to the Chairmen and members of other Committees and, indeed, to the members of the Council as a whole. I have received the most wholehearted and friendly cooperation from my fellow Chief Officers, a fact of no mean importance, and one which has been most helpful to me and made my task of getting to grips with the problems of a Metropolitan Borough Public Health Department very much easier than might otherwise have been. I would like at this stage to pay tribute to the work of my predecessor, Dr. G. H. Dart, whose record of excellent service in so many spheres of public health and preventive medicine in this Borough over the long period of thirtytwo years is well known to everybody. Dr. Dart also, from the moment I was appointed, most generously gave me every possible assistance in connection with the work of the Department, and as a result the burden of taking up my new office was considerably lightened - I would like him to be assured of my profound gratitude. Hackney in regard to acreage and population occupies sixth place in London's twenty-eight metropolitan boroughs. In area it isthe largest borough north of the Thames although our neighbouring borough of Islington has a larger population. It is most obvious to even a newcomer to the Borough that many changes have taken place over the last quarter century, and although most of these changes can be considered to be improvements and in the interests of the inhabitants generally, it is equally clear that much remains to be done in many spheres. The results of the 1951 census show that over the twenty-one year period since the 1931 census the population of the Borough decreased by roughly twenty per cent. Some reduction in population in our London boroughs and big 4 towns generally up and down the country is inevitable and probably desirable, but town planners are faced with a difficult problem in their efforts to find suitable building sites and to house as many people as possible reasonably near their places of work. Much hardship, in the main financial but often resulting in potential danger to health, can result from the rehousing of people long distances from their employment. One of the major tasks of the Public Health Department is to keep a close watch on the housing conditions of the people, with a view to seeing that they are reasonable and not a source of danger to health and wellbeing. The deterioration, apart from war damage, of house property as a result of the inevitable neglect occurring during the war years is now presenting a very serious problem. Until such time - unfortunately that happy era is not yet in sight - as the provision of new dwellings is adequate to meet the requirements of all applicants, much of the older type property must be kept in use: dealing with such dwellings and holding a fair balance between complaints of tenants and the difficulties in which so many owners now find themselves continues, and will continue for many years, to take up much of the time, energy and skill of the staffs of Public Health Departments. It is encouraging to hear suggestions for further slum clearance programmes now we are half-way through the first post-war five year programme. These programmes deal with areas comprising a number of houses, and the responsibility for clearance as well as for the rehousing of displaced persons is shared between the County Council and the Borough Councils. Individual unfit houses and parts of houses are left to be dealt with by the Borough Council, and in this connection I have the impression that the time has now arrived for close attention to be paid to a number of the many dwellings of the basement or underground room type that exist in this Borough. The importance of atmospheric pollution, so long one of the gravest dangers to the public health in London, was brought home to the people more forcibly than ever before as a result of the appalling death rate and damage to health resulting from the conditions prevailing in the middle of December. It has so often happened in the history of mankind that out of evil has come good, and there are indications that at long last this great blight on the good name of London's local government is likely to be attacked with the determination, energy and zeal such a serious state of affairs demands. I am very pleased to record that the Hackney Borough Council is fully alive to the seriousness of the problem and is willing to play its part to the full in any measures which can be taken to deal with it. Pull details of the activities of the Department in regard to food and food hygiene are set out in the appropriate section of the body of the report. One is pleased to report that many improvements in the hygienic handling of food in shops, cafes and other places continue to be made. The general situation, however, in regard to food does not permit of any degree of complacency; a good deal more remains to be done, and I am of opinion that far better results are likely to be obtained by education and persuasion than through punitive measures. The matter of clean food is one in which the housewife has much power in her hands: she must, however, be urged to bring home to traders her determination to be served with clean, safe food, Deliberate adulteration of food is, fortunately, nowadays a relatively rare occurrence and consequently more of the time of the staff can be devoted to making direct contact with persons in the food trades, with a view to helping them in their endeavours to secure the hygienic handling and safety of food. In the nation-wide ageing of our people Hackney shares, and measures for the wellbeing of aged persons are of paramount importance. The County Council is in the main the local authority under the National Assistance Act, 1948, and it is also the local health authority under the National Health Service Act, 1946. Whilst the Borough Council' s powers in regard to the personal health and welfare services are very limited it is, nevertheless, a fact that 5 the sad and lonely plight in which so many aged and infirm people today find themselves is in most cases, in the first instance, brought to the notice of the staff of this Department. All such cases are visited, the circumstances are fully investigated, and every effort is made to bring about the necessary improvements in the home conditions, or in appropriate cases to secure removal to a home or hospital. In this work the staff of the Department act in close co-operation with the various sections of the health and welfare departments of the London County Council and also with the Hackney Voluntary Association for the Welfare of Old People. Statistics for the year under review indicate that the health of the Borough remains satisfactory. Caution, however, is needed in the interpretation of statistics, more particularly when they are based on relatively small numbers. True, the general death rate and the death rates from a variety of causes show no great variation as compared with recent years, but morbitity (sickness) rates, which are not always readily obtainable, rather than death rates, are probably a truer index of the health of a people; it is to be regretted that more detailed information in regard to sickness is not available to local authorities. In conclusion, I would like to express to the staff of the Department my very best thanks for the help and co-operation I have received from them one and all since I came to Hackney. I wish especially to record my warm appreciation of the able help, in dealing with special cases, which the Department continues to receive from Dr. D. Bielenky, one of our local general practitioners who acts as Deputy Medical Officer in my absence and at other times. I am, Mr. Mayor, ladies and gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN FENTON. Medical Officer of Health, 6 PHYSICAL FEATURES, SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND VITAL STATISTICS The Borough of Hackney is one of the twenty eight London Metropolitan Boroughs and is situate in the north-eastern part of the County of London. It adjoins the Borough of Tottenham in the north, the Boroughs of Bethnal Green and Shoreditch in the south, Poplar in the south-east, the Boroughs of Walthamstow and Leyton in the east, and Islington and Stoke Newington in the west. The area of the Borough is 3,287 acres, approximately 609 acres being public open spaces, 10.9 acres of which are maintained by the Borough Council and 598.45 acres by the London County Council. The Borough is both residential and industrial, and the density of population is 52.02 persons per acre. The chief industries are the manufacture of clothing, furniture and footwear. The Borough varies in elevation between 16 ft, and 112 ft. above ordnance datum. The north-west portion lies on yellow clay, and there is a considerable area on a bed of, gravel and sand of varying depths; other portions are on brick earth, and in the Lea Valley there is a bed of alluvial gravel. Underlying the whole of the Borough is the London blue clay, which in a few places appears near the surface. The number of inhabited dwellings at the 1931 census was estimated to be 34,155. At the end of 1952, rate book records showed the number of inhabited hereditaments to be 39,728. The estimated rateable value of the Borough at 1st April was £1,435,000: a 1d rate produced £5,840. The types of dwelling generally throughout the borough vary from the terraced type of town dwelling of four to five rooms to the larger Victorian or Edwardian type of basement house. Development in modern years has provided large blocks of flat dwellings, and in the years following the war, a number of temporary prefabricated bungalows and hutments were erected. The fifteenth census of the population of England and Wales was taken on the 8th April, 1951, and the preliminary report of the Registrar General gives the following comparisons of the population of Hackney enumerated at that census, as compared with the census of 1931:- Males Females Total 1931 Census 99,794 115,539 215,333 1951 Census 80,902 90,435 171,337 These figures show that the population of the Borough has decreased by 20.4 per cent, in that twenty-year, period. The figures for the administrative County ofLondonshow a decrease of 1,048,667, being 23.8 per cent, whilst the figures for England and Wales as a whole show an increase of 3,792, 547 persons, being 9. 5 per cent. In connection with the census of 1951, an innovation on the part of the Registrar General was the publication of "One per cent. Sample Tables". These tables were the result of the extraction and analysis of a small sample of the total records collected - the following interesting particulars relate to Hackney: - Males Females Total TOTAL POPULATION 82,800 88,500 171,300 MARITAL CONDITION: Single 35,000 34,500 Married 44,900 44,300 171,300 Widowed and Divorced 2,900 9,700 AGE GROUPS: 0-4 7,300 7, 100 14,400 5-14 11,500 9,300 20,800 15-24 9,700 10,600 20,300 25-34 13,900 14,700 28,600 35-44 14,300 13,500 27,800 45-54 10,400 12,900 23,300 55-64 8,200 9,900 18,100 65 and over 7,500 10,500 18,000 82,800 88,500 171,300 7 The following figures relate to private households, rooms occupied, densities of occupation and household arrangements:- Total households 57,600 Households in shared dwellings 32,500 Households of successive densities of occupation (persons per room).

Suicides in the borough totalled 17 - ten men and seven women. Motor vehicle accidents accounted for 8 male deaths, and all other accidents accounted for 13 male and 3 female deaths. Inquests relating to Hackney residents were held in 34 cases. Deaths of Hackney residents from the various causes and in the different age groups are shown in the table on Pages 1-5 of the Appendix Maternal Mortality There were no deaths from causes associated with pregnancy or childbirth. The maternal mortality rates in Hackney and in England and Wales for the last five years were as follows: - 1952 1951 1950 1949 1948 Hackney nil 0.77 0.76 nil nil England and Wales 0.72 0.79 0. 86 0.98 1.02 Infantile Mortality,, Fifty children under the age of one year, and resident in Hackney, died, resulting in an infantile mortality rate of 19.78 per thousand live births, as compared with a rate of 23.8 for the County of London and 27.6 for England and Wales. Comparable infant mortality rates for Hackney, London, and England and Wales for the last five years are as follows:- 1952 1951 1950 1949 1948 Hackney 19.78 29.02 22.92 22. 50 24.36 London 23.8 26.4 26.3 29 31 England and Wales 27.6 29.6 29.8 32 34 10 CAUSES OF DEATH IN CHILDREN UNDER ONE YEAR Cause of death Under 14 hours 1 day to 1 week 1 - 2 weeks 2 - 3 weeks 3 - 4 weeks Total under 4 weeks 1 - 3 months 3 - 6 months 6 - 9 mon ths 9 - 12 months Total Acute intestinal obstruction due to intussusception - - - - - - - 1 - - 1 Acute pneumococcal pericarditis - - 1 - 1 - - - - 1 Asphyxia Neonatorum 1 - - - - 1 - - - - 1 Atelactasis 3 1 - - - 4 - - - - 4 Bronchitis - - - - - - - 3 - - 3 Cerebral Haemorrhage 3 2 - - - 5 - - - - 5 Congenital Malformation - 2 - 1 2 5 1 1 1 - 8 Gastro Enteritis . - - - - - - - - 2 - 2 Neonatal Anoxia and Acute Suppurative Broncho Pneumonia - - 1 - - 1 - - - - 1 Phrenic Nerve Palsy, collapse of lung followed by respiratory failure - - - - - - 1 - - - 1 Pneumonia - - - - - - 2 3 - 1 6 Prematurity 10 6 - - - 16 - - - - 16 Toxaemia and Encephalitis - - - - 1 1 - - - - 1 Totals 17 11 1 2 3 34 4 8 3 1 50 11 PREVALENCE AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES The following diseases are compulsorily notifiable in Hackney:- Anthrax Acute Encephalitis Acute Influenzal Pneumonia Acute Primary Pneumonia Acute Poliomyelitis Cholera Continued Fever Diphtheria (or Membranous Croup) Dysentery Paratyphoid Fever ) Typhoid Fever ) Enteric Fever Erysipelas Glanders Hydrophobia Malaria Measles Ophthalmia Neonatorum Plague Puerperal Pyrexia Relapsing Fever Scabies Scarlet Fever (or Scarlatina) Smallpox Tuberculosis Typhus Fever Whooping Cough Food Poisoning (or suspected Food Poisoning) Meningococcal Infection (formerly Meningococcal Meningitis: Cerebrospinal Fever: Cerebro-spinal Meningitis) The total number of cases of infectious and contagious diseases notified was 2,835, Measles accounting for 61.6 per cent, of the notifications received, SCARLET FEVER. The 392 cases of this disease were an increase of 76 over the previous year: 125 cases were treated in hospital. There was no particular seasonal incidence and the disease appears to have been of the mild type. The treatment at home of the type of Scarlet Fever now prevalent does not appear to result in spread of the infection to other members of the family or to neighbours. DIPHTHERIA. Five persons were admitted to hospital as suspected cases but Diphtheria was not confirmed and I am glad to report that, for the second year in succession, no case of Diphtheria occurred in the Borough. Details of the five suspected cases, with the revised diagnoses are as follows:- Male, aged 3 years Streptococcal tonsillitis. Female, aged 18 years do. Female, aged 16 years do. Female, aged 30 years Acute pharyngitis, with mixed organisms. Female, aged 54 years Broncho pneumonia due to Uraemia due to acute Nephritis (died within five days). The absence of this distressing and fatal disease is a wonderful tribute to the measures which have been taken over the last twenty-five years, and there is little doubt that the immunisation campaign is responsible for the present happy state of affairs. It is to be hoped that nothing will hinder the continued progress of this great advance in preventive medicine. POLIOMYELITIS (INFANTILE PARALYSIS). This potentially fatal and crippling disease is becoming more prevalent throughout the whole world and this country is no exception. Unfortunately, our knowledge regarding the true nature and method of spread of the virus responsible is limited. It would appear that the infection is widespread but only a relatively small prPortion of infected persons are clinically recognisable: some cases present Paralytic symptoms but many do not. Sporadic cases occur at all times and epidemics occur at irregular intervals with the highest incidence in the summer and early autumn. Certain forms of the disease are particularly dangerous and may rapidly produce fatal results. 12 Notifications were received relating to 29 persons suffering, or suspected to be suffering, from Poliomyelitis; twenty-eight cases were removed to hospital. In 15 instances the disease was confirmed, 8 being of the paralytic and 7 of the non-paralytic type. Details of confirmed cases are:- Sex Age Muscles affected Paralytic - Male %. years (nursed at home) .- right deltoid. Female 4 years - right thigh and leg. Female 4½ years - right quadriceps and right anterior tibial groups. Male 8 years - left foot. Female 5½ years - right foot. Female 32 years - right hip and leg. Female 4 years - right leg. Male 4 years - right leg and foot. Non-paralytic - Males 6 years, 7½ years and 6 years. Females 3½ years, 44 years, 11 years and 33 years. The diagnoses in the 14 non-confirmed cases were:- Influenza, Catarrhal condition, Meningism, Tonsillitis, Coryza, Emphysema, Gastritis, Paronychia of left toe and "disease not specified". Detailed enquiries were made at the home of each case and all close contacts visited three times a week for 21 days, which is regarded from a practical point of view as covering the maximum incubation period. In no instance did more than one case occur in the same family or house. DYSENTERY. It will be noted that 134 cases were notified, as compared with 88 in the previous year. The incidence of this disease has been on the increase since the war years. It is, of course, possible that the increase may in large part be accounted for by more accurate diagnosis resulting from the greatly increased bacteriological facilities now available. The disease is for the most part of a mild type though in young and weakly infants it can be dangerous. It is particularly troublesome when outbreaks occur in nurseries and other close communities. OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM. This disease is defined in the Public Health (Ophthalmia Neonatorum) Regulations as "a purulent discharge from the eyes of an infant, commencing within 21 days from the date of its birth". Of the 20 cases notified 19 were in relation to infants born in hospital and one born at home. The onset of the disease varied from the day of birth to 14 days after birth. Particulars of all cases notified were reported tothe London County Council Divisional medical staff who arranged for a health visitor to make enquiries and to report as to the ultimate effect on vision. Great advances have been made in the modern treatment of this condition and in no case did any impairment of vision result. PUERPERAL PYREXIA. The Puerperal Pyrexia Regulations of 1951 require medical practitioners to notify the Medical Officer of Health of "any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100.4° Fahrenheit (38° Centigrade) or more has occurred within 14 days after childbirth or miscarriage". Under the old Regulations it was the custom for the Authority of the area in which the woman normally resided to accept the notification but under the present system the Authority of the area in which the person is confined, irrespective of home address, has to accept notifications relating to all cases occurring in the area; as far as Hackney is concerned this results in an increase in the number of notifications to be accepted. Of the total of 148 cases 93 occurred in a local maternity hospital, 50 in other hospitals in the Borough and in five cases they related to home confinements. Mastitis, breast abscess and uterine infection were the main causes of the condition. 13 WHOOPING COUGH. The number of cases notified was 230, as compared with 453 in 1951 and 558 in 1950. The disease is, nevertheless, far too constantly prevalent and apart from danger to life it can be a cause of prolonged morbidity and even chronic illhealth. Experiments in regard to artificial protection are being carefully watched and the results awaited with much interest. It would appear that there is great hope of a satisfactory vaccine being made available in the relatively near future. SMALLPOX. No cases of Smallpox occurred but information was received as to the arrival in the Borough of two contacts of the disease. These persons were visited daily for sixteen days from the last date of contact. Outbreaks of this disease in various parts of the country in recent years stress the need for no relaxation of effort in preventive measures. With the speed of modern methods of travel the danger of infection from abroad is greater than ever before. Vaccination, and re-vaccination, are still the great weapons in protecting a community, and it is to be hoped that persuasion will result in far greater numbers of people being vaccinated than was the case in the old days of compulsory legislation. The possession of an International Certificate of Vaccination against Cholera and Smallpox, as approved and adopted by the Fourth World Health Assembly, is essential for persons travelling to most foreign countries. This certificate must bear the stamp of the local authority and the signature of the Vaccinator must be authenticated by the Medical Officer of Health; a considerable number of such certificates was dealt with in the Department. ENCEPHALITIS. Four cases of Acute Infective Encephalitis and two cases of Acute Post-infectious Encephalitis were notified. All six cases were treated in hospital and there was one death, in a baby aged three weeks.

Under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1930 and 1952, notifications to the number of 241 pulmonary cases and 20 cases of nonpulmonary were received. Of the respiratory cases, 167 were primary notifications, that is, cases which had not previously been notified in this Borough or elsewhere; the primary notifications in the non-pulmonary cases numbered 15. Non-primary notifications totalled 79, of which 74 were pulmonary and 5 nnn-nulmonarv The age grouping was:- Age Groups Primary Notifications Non-Primary Notifications Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female 0-1 2 1 - - - - - - 1-5 2 1 - 2 - - - - 5-15 5 6 2 - 1 - - 1 15-25 20 21 1 - 6 9 - 2 25-45 37 24 3 3 23 15 1 - 45-65 31 8 - 3 9 2 - - 65-75 5 1 - - 2 - - - 75 and upwards 3 - - 1 3 4 - 1 Total 105 62 6 9 44 30 1 4 The sources of information relating to the 79 non-primary notifications were: - Death returns:Local Registrar 15 Registrar General 2 Transfers - from other areas 62 The attack rate per thousand of the population for all forms of tuberculosis notified for the first time was 1.06 compared with 1.07 in 1951.

It will be remembered that the mass radiography unit of the North East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board operated at two centres in the Borough in 1951, from October 9th to November 15th. During the year under review, unfortunately, it was not possible for the unit to visit Hackney, but I understand that it did operate in two local hospitals, where some 1,600 expectant mothers were examined. This new weapon in fighting the battle against tuberculosis is one of the greatest advances of modern preventive medicine, and I am happy to say that at the time of writing the unit is again operating at a Centre in the Borough, It is hoped to arrange for the unit to visit a number of centres during the next year. SCABIES AND VERMINOUS CONDITIONS. Scabies is still a notifiable disease in London, and 19 cases were formally notified, as compared with 36 in the previous year. The decline in the incidence of this unpleasant complaint since the war years has been very remarkable indeed; as recently as 1946 over 900 cases were notified. Pull facilities for the treatment of scabies and verminous conditions exist at the Millfields Disinfecting Station, where 58 cases of scabies were treated. Cases of head and body lice brought to the notice of the department and treated at Millfields numbered 841. By agreement with the London County Council, facilities are provided at Millfields for that authority to carry out the treatment of minor ailments in school children; treatment of scabies and verminous conditions in school 20 children is also carried out there by the Borough Council's staff under the supervision of a London County Council school nurse. Notifications of Scabies over the last decade were:- 1943 518 1948 208 1944 1,032 1949 128 1945 1,021 1950 61 1946 924 1951 36 1947 318 1952 19 Details of treatment of Scabies and Verminous conditions:- Scabies Head or body lice Cleansing Baths Cases Treatment s Cases Treatments Cases Treatments Children under 5 years 5 16 43 44 2 2 Children over 5 years 33 101 694 699 - - Adults 20 55 104 107 3 3 Total 58 172 841 850 5 5 Preventive treatment was given to 26 persons who had been in close contact with sufferers from Scabies. DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION. The Council possess a very well- equipped Disinfecting Station in Millfields Road. The Lodge has not been used for residential purposes for some years but the Deputy Superintendent of the Station took up residence there in May 1953. One block of buildings, providing four units of living accommodation each comprising three rooms, was erected for the isolation of contacts of major infectious disease. The two ground floor units of this block have, however, for a number of years been used as a centre for the treatment of scabies, verminous conditions and minor ailments. The isolation accommodation was not used during 1952. The main disinfection plant is situate in another building and comprises two large steam disinfectors, a smaller steam disinfector, a formalin chamber, a phenol chamber, airing and drying rooms, bathrooms, laundry, stores and boiler house. Disinfection by hydrogen cyanide is carried out in three specially constructed brick chambers, two being sufficiently spacious to accommodate large furniture vans which obviates the need to unload the contents. Unwholesome materials and unsound food are destroyed in a brick built incinerator. Adequate garage accommodation is available. The staff employed consisted of Superintendent, Deputy Superintendent, drivers, disinfectors, cleansing attendants and laundry hands. In the laundry section, in addition to infected materials, the laundering of articles used at welfare centres and day nurseries in the Borough was carried out on behalf of the London County Council; four women were employed on this work. The following is a summary of disinfection and disinfestation work carried out:- (a) After the occurrence of infectious and contagious diseases:- Rooms disinfected 1,348 Articles of bedding and clothing disinfected or destroyed 31,612 Public Library and other books disinfected 15,508 (b) For the destruction of vermin:- Rooms disinfected 759 Articles destroyed 1,148 Beds, mattresses, blankets, etc., treated in cyanide gas chambers 719 Van loads of furniture treated in cyanide gas chambers 195 Articles disinfested by other means 4,550 21 The 195 van loads of furniture treated in the cyanide chambers included 157 loads treated on behalf of the Tottenham Borough Council. Disinfection of items of clothing for export as required by the importing countries, was undertaken for a number of firms dealing in this business, and articles to the number of 382,775 were dealt with. Some 66 van loads and 127 bins of verminous and unwholesome articles collected in various places were taken to the Station for destruction. DISINFECTANTS AND INSECTICIDES. In cases of infectious disease, including Tuberculosis, disinfectants are issued free of charge. Disinfectants, insecticides and rat poison are available at the Department's Stores in Hillman Street at the rear of the Town Hall, and during the year sales to the value of £310, £415 and £4 15s. 0d. respectively took place. HOMERTON HIGH STREET STORES. The Public Health Department has the use of the second floor of the Borough Council's Depot at 186, Homerton High Street at a rental of £545 per annum. This accommodation houses departmental stores, furniture and effects of deceased persons who have been buried in accordance with the provisions of the National Assistance Act, and L.C.C. Furniture, bedding, etc. for use in the Welfare Centres and Day Nurseries in the Borough. For the accommodation provided and service of the Storekeeper the County Council pays an annual sum of £130. 22 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE. The vast majority of premises of all types in the Borough are drained by the combined system, that is to say both the surface water and sewerage discharge into the same drain. The drainage staff of the Department comprises one drainage foreman, one driver and twelve labourers. The work undertaken consists mainly in tracing and exposing drains under Section 40(1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, clearing stoppages in emergencies, minor repairs to drains following the service of notices under Section 40(4), tracing rat runs and assisting in the smoking of rat runs as circumstances require: in addition these men assist in the removal of offensive refuse from vacant sites. The construction and maintenance of sewers vested in the Borough Council is the responsibility of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department. Work carried out by that Department during the year included the reconstruction of approximately 1,127 yards of sewers. In certain areas of the Borough the sewers, by reason of age and the redevelopment which has taken place since they were originally constructed, are inadequate for the volume of sewerage they now receive. In times of abnormal rainfall these sewers are subject to surcharge which frequently results in flooding of houses in the area; one such sewer is that in Rendlesham Road which has been a source of complaints since 1926. In times of heavy rainfall this sewer surcharges to such an extent that the basements of houses in the road have on occasions suffered flooding to a depth of up to two feet. It is gratifying to report that the Minister of Housing and Local Government has now given approval to the expenditure necessary for the reconstruction of this sewer, PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1936 SECTIONS 34, 40 AND 107' (Drainage). Plans of proposed works of con struction of new drains or reconstruction or alterations to existing systems were approved by the Public Health Committee in respect of 61 premises: drains and sanitary fittings tested and examined totalled 5,301; defective drains were relaid at 139 premises and repaired at 631 premises. It was necessary to serve 121 notices under section 40 (4) of the Act requiring the carrying out of drainage work. In many instances the existence of defective drains came to the knowledge of the department through the medium of builders giving the required notice of their intention to carry out drainage works. In the following 14 instances involving 33 dwelling houses the Council exercised their default powers and carried out the work required at a total cost of £1,381 13s. 2d, £ s. d. 187, Balls Pond Road 90 14 5 2, Bergholt Crescent 72 1 2 4, " " 72 1 2 6, " " 72 1 2 8, " " 72 1 2 10, " " 72 1 2 12, " " 72 1 1 67, Cadogan Terrace 63 4 9 68, " " 63 4 9 119, Dalston Lane 50 18 7 129, Holly Street 11 12 5 131, " " 11 12 5 133, " " 11 12 5 135, " " 11 12 5 137, " " 11 12 6 23  £ s. d. 169, Kyverdale Road 4 11 10 171, 4 11 10 173, " " 4 11 10 175, " " 4 11 10 177, " " 4 11 10 179, " " 4 11 10 181, " " 4 11 9 183, " " 4 11 9 49/51, Leswin Road 131 4 6 11, London Fields, East Side 21 1 6 58, Maury Road 56 3 7 3, Mehetabel Road 12 7 9 2, Mortimer Road 63 2 7 4, " " 63 13 5 9, Stoneham Road) 111 13 6 10, " " 1, Wallis Road 63 4 9 84, Woodland Street 63 15 6 Details of drainage work carried out at owners' request and expense by the staff of the Department are set out on Page 7 of the Appendix. Contraventions of the London County Council Drainage and Water Closet Bylaws were discovered at 139 premises, Notices drawing attention to these contraventions were served and in nine instances of failure to comply legal proceedings were instituted. In respect of eight summonses penalties were imposed and/or costs awarded. The defendant named in the remaining case did not appear and a warrant for his arrest was sworn but at the end of the year had not been executed. SECTION 82 AND THE FIFTH SCHEDULE (Nuisances). Some 6,000 complaints of alleged insanitary conditions received were investigated, and nuisances were discovered at 4,398 premises. As a result of all forms of inspections made, action was necessary in respect of 6,087 premises, and 5,265 Intimation Notices and 430 Notices under Section 40 (4) or the various by-laws were served. The defects at the remaining premises were remedied without service of notices. The number of Statutory Notices served totalled 2,332 and it was necessary to institute legal proceedings in 197 cases to secure compliance: as a result 133 Nuisance Orders were obtained, one summons was dismissed and 40 were withdrawn - in most cases by reason of the fact that the work was completed before the date of hearing. In a further 17 cases legal proceedings were taken for non-compliance with Nuisance Orders, and penalties were obtained in 16 cases; the remaining case was withdrawn as the defendant had been adjudged bankrupt. Nuisances were abated at 5,429 premises, 3,705 following the service of Intimation Notices and 1,724 following the service of Statutory Notices. At the following 12 premises, the owners of which could not be traced or were financially unable to comply with Nuisance Orders, the Council carried out the necessary work in default at a total cost of £2,249 1s. 8d,  £ s. d. 38, Ainsworth Road 136 14 10 50, Alkham Road 70 18 4 22, Brooke Road 885 19 0 58, Brooke Road 457 13 6 21, De Beauvoir Square 152 0 0 3, Shacklewell Lane 37 7 6 5, Shacklewell Lane 29 5 0 24  £ s. d. 28, Stoke Newington Road 80 19 6 128, Tottenham Road 187 8 0 35, Trederwen Road 41 0 0 37, Trederwen Road 104 12 6 31, Norcott Road 65 3 6 SECTION 87. (Collection and Disposal of refuse). This important public health service is the responsibility of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, who informs me that house refuse is collected weekly from dwelling houses in the Borough but in cases of blocks of flats collections are made at periods varying from weekly to daily, according to the conditions and circumstances applicable. Approximately half the refuse collected in the Borough is disposed of by Islington Borough Council under an agreement and is conveyed by rail from the Islington depot to a controlled tip in Hertfordshire. The remainder is taken to Homerton Wharf where it is barged and conveyed to a controlled tip in Essex. Kitchen waste to the amount of 4,392 tons was sold to the Tottenham Borough Council for conversion into pig food. The amount of house refuse collected and destroyed totalled approximately 40,708 tons. In addition some 204 tons of trade refuse was delivered by traders direct to Homerton Wharf, Materials salvaged totalled 337 tons of metal and 139 tons of waste paper. SECTIONS 95-103. (Water Supply). The Metropolitan Water Board is the statutory authority for London's water supply. All houses in the Borough are supplied direct from the Board's mains. There are 10 premises, one a hospital and nine business premises, at which a total of 14 wells are in use; eight disused wells exist at five other premises. The water from three of the functioning wells at Hackney Hospital, W. Connell & Company Limited, Baker's Hill, and the Clapton Stadium, Millfields Road, is used for drinking purposes but that from the other 11 wells is used only for trade purposes. All the wells in use are "deep wells", made by boring through the various strata and clay to the chalk or other water-bearing stratum, and vary in depth from 300 to 664 feet. Under the provisions of Sections 95(2) 26 certificates were issued in respect of new or rebuilt flats, bungalows and houses, comprising 259 separate units of living accommodation. During the course of various forms of inspection waste of water from defective fittings, etc., was observed at 230 premises and notifications thereof were sent to the Metropolitan Water Board. Section 98 requires the Metropolitan Water Board to notify the Council of premises from which the water supply has been discontinued. All such premises were inspected and, where necessary, notices requiring the reinstatement of the supply were served on the owners of the property. In one instance the owner/occupier of the dwelling house was summoned under Section 109 for discontinuing the supply to the accommodation occupied by a tenant; a penalty was imposed and the costs awarded to the Council. SECTION 107. (Dustbins). It is the practice in this Borough to rely upon the by-laws made by the London County Council under Section 39(1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 and continued in force by Section 307 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, in order to secure the provision of dustbins, rather than to proceed under Section 105 of the latter Act. Under the by-laws the obligation is solely on the owner, whereas under Section 105 of the Public Health Act a notice may be served on either the owner or the occupier. A total of 170 notices was served under these by-laws upon owners failing to maintain dust receptacles in proper condition; in three cases only was it necessary to institute legal proceedings and in each case the summons was withdrawn on payment of the Council,s costs as the dustbins had meanwhile been supplied. 25 SECTION 113 (Public Conveniences). There are 10 public conveniences for men and 10 for women in the Borough; in addition there are 9 urinals owned by the Council and one privately owned urinal, the cleansing of which is undertaken by the Council. Since the 1st April, 1950, no charge has been made for the use of conveniences. In the interest of public health, free hand washing facilities, comprising hot and cold water, liquid soap and paper hand towels, are provided in all 20 conveniences. SECTION 123 (Verminous Houses). The staff of the Disinfecting Station dealt with the necessary disinfestation of 759 verminous rooms in 394 houses. Verminous articles to the number of 5,269 were dealt with at the Disinfecting Station and a further 1,148 such articles were removed and destroyed. All notices requiring the cleansing of dwelling houses served on owners or occupiers were complied with and no legal proceedings were necessary. SECTION 140 (Offensive Trades). The offensive trades scheduled by this section are Blood Boiler, Bone Boiler, Catgut Maker or Manufacturer, Dresser of Pish Skins, Dresser of Fur Skins, Fellmonger, Fat Melter or Extractor, Glue and Size Manufacturer, Gut Scraper, Knacker, Manure Manufacturer, Slaughterer, Soap Boiler, Tallow Melter, Tripe Boiler, and no persons may establish anew any of these trades without the consent of the sanitary authority. London County Council By-laws made under Section 142 provide for the regulation of the conduct of any such business. At five premises the trade of Fur Skin Dresser was carried on and that of Poultry Slaughterer at two premises. These premises were inspected frequently and all found to be conducted in a satisfactory manner. SECTION 146 (Rag and Bone Dealers). The 16 premises in which the business of rag and bone dealer was carried on were inspected; no infringement of the relevant London County Council By-laws was discovered. SECTIONS 156-166 (Common Lodging Houses). The one remaining common lodging house is situated at Nos. 23 to 25 Well Street and provides accommodation for 139 men. This is a well conducted establishment and frequent inspections during the year revealed no infringement of the relevant by-laws. SECTIONS 167-170 (Public Baths and Wash Houses). The Council have provided public slipper baths at Lower Clapton Road (Central Baths), Wardle Street, Gayhurst Road, Shacklewell Lane, Englefield Road and Eastway, These baths are under the control of the General Manager of Baths and Civic Recreation. Attached to the Eastway Baths is a public laundry comprising washing machines, hydro extractors, drying horses, mangles and drying facilities' this service is in great demand by persons lacking suitable laundry facilities in their own homes. The three swimming baths under the control of the Council are situated at the Central Baths, Lower Clapton Road: one of these baths is reserved for males, one for females and one for mixed bathing. The one open-air bath in the Borough, situated in London Fields, is provided and maintained by the London County Council. A vapour suite has been installed at the Central Baths and comprises Steam, Massage and Plunge Rooms. The latest addition is the Aerotone Bath designed to alleviate the pain and suffering resulting from arthritis, fibrositis, rheumatism, lumbago and kindred ailments. SECTIONS 234-239 (Mortuary and Coroner's Court). The Public Mortuary and Coroner's Court adjoins the Churchyard of the Parish Church of St. John at Hackney. Residential accommodation is provided for the Mortuary Keeper. The Court accommodation comprises a Waiting Room, Court Room and Coroner's Office The Mortuary provides refrigerated accommodation for 15 bodies and there is a large, well equipped Post Mortem Room as well as a combined Chapel/Viewing Room. 26  Hackney Residents NonResidents Total Number of bodies received 391 175 566 (1) To await burial 5 1 6 (2) To await post-mortem examination 386 174 560 Cause of death certified by Coroner 352 159 511 Number of inquests held 34 15 49 The bodies of 103 residents of Stoke Newington were received. The revised agreement with that Authority operates from 1st January, 1953 and provides for an annual payment of £300. VACANT SITES. There are a number of vacant sites, the majority a legacy from the war, many of which give rise from time to time to complaints of rat infestation and of nuisances arising from putrescible and other deposited material. The responsibility for removing such deposits devolves on the owners of the sites concerned but, since, action to compel owners to fulfil their obligations would, in many instances, be difficult and cause delay, the Public Health Department frequently undertook the removal of materials likely to endanger the health of the public. Where the clearing of the sites was undertaken by this Department the material was in some cases destroyed by burning and burial on the site, and in other instances it was removed to the Disinfecting Station for destruction. The material so removed amounted to 11 van loads and 29 bins of rubbish and 49 miscellaneous items. STATIC WATER TANKS. There are 13 static water tanks remaining in the Borough and nine of these gave rise to nuisances from accumulation of stagnant water. The Fire Brigade rendered valuable service in pumping water from these tanks. The usual method of dealing with tanks containing water was to remove any obnoxious matter and then spray the water with a mixture of engine oil, carbolic acid and a D.D.T. preparation which, after pumping had been completed, settled as a film over the residual matter in the tank. Debris, etc., unlikely to give rise to nuisance was allowed to remain. DANGEROUS STRUCTURES. (London Buildings Acts (Amendment) Act, 1939). Particulars of 162 structures, or parts of structures, which appeared on inspection to be unsafe were sent to the District Surveyors of the London County Council. LICENSED PREMISES. Prom time to time requests for reports on the general sanitary condition of licensed premises are received from the Licensing Justices to whom applications for transfer of licences have been made; 55 premises were inspected and reports thereon forwarded to the Justices. In respect of one premises at which defects were found a notice was served under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. LAND CHARGES ACT, 1925 Enquiries as to sanitary and other notices, orders or charges outstanding were dealt with in respect of 1,418 premises. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Rodent control work was carried out in accordance with the methods of treatment recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, by whom fifty per cent. of the cost of this work, not otherwise recovered, is reimbursed to the Council. Charges are made for treatments carried out at 27 business premises but no charge is made in the case of private dwellings. This work was carried out by a staff of one Rodent Officer and six rodent operatives. Complaints of infestation at 1,251 premises were received and investigations revealed the presence of rodents at 1,058 dwelling houses and 158 business premises. The district inspector was consulted in all cases where the source of infestation was considered to be a defective drain. Notices requiring the carrying out of structural work were served under Sec4 of the Act in respect of two dwellings during the year. The total baits laid were:- Pre-baits 14,882 Poison baits 39,906 Post-baits 3,844 Following treatment some 1,258 premises were cleared of infestation. "Block" treatment of properties was carried out in nine instances. In connection with rodent control 653 drains were examined, of which 435 were submitted to test and 209 found to be defective. In regard to the treat ment of business premises chareres to the amount, of £153 6s. 6d, were made The following is a summary of premises inspected and treated:- Business Premises DwellimgHouses L.C.C. Premises Totals Premises infested Rats 71 Rats 515 Rats - Rats 586 Mice 87 Mice 543 Mice 2 Mice 632 158 1058 2 1218 Premises cleared Rats 74 Rats 533 Rats - Rats 607 Mice 95 Mice 554 Mice 2 Mice 651 169 1087 2 1258 Treatment of the Council's sewers was undertaken by the staff of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department, SHOPS ACT, 1950 The duties of the Council under this Act are restricted to enforcing those provisions of Section 38 which relate to the maintenance of suitable and efficient ventilation and a reasonable temperature in shops, and the provision of sanitary conveniences for persons employed in or about the shop. During the course of inspections of the various shops in the Borough, contraventions of the Act were discovered at six premises. Notices drawing attention to these contraventions were served and the matters were remedied. There were no applications under Section 38(6) of the Act for exemption from the provisions relating to sanitary accommodation. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 • This Act, which came into operation on the 1st April, 1952, requires all premises at which pets are sold or kept for the purpose of sale to be licensed by the local authority, and appears to be a measure more to prevent cruelty to animals than a general public health measure. In granting a licence a local authority is empowered to make conditions to secure that:- (a) the accommodation at which the animals is kept is suitable as pects size, temperature, lighting and ventilation: (b) animals will be adequately supplied with suitable food and drink and are not sold at too early an age; 28 (c) reasonable precautions will be taken to prevent the spread of infectious disease among animals and to secure the taking of appropriate steps against fire or other emergencies. In order to secure uniformity throughout the metropolitan area in regard to the conditions to be observed by licence holders, the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee was asked to frame model conditions for application by all the metropolitan boroughs. Pending such recommendation provisional licences were issued. The conditions recommended by the Standing Joint Committee were adopted by the Council on the 8th October, 1952, when the provisional licences were withdrawn and new licences embodying the recommended conditions issued. Among the conditions adopted was one that pets should not be handed to customers in paper bags, The 12 pet shops licensed were visited and no infringement of the terms of the licences was discovered. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 This Act, designed to prevent the use of unclean filling materials in upholstered articles and other articles which are stuffed or lined, came into operation on the 1st November, 1951, and requires the registration of premises where filling materials are used and the licensing of premises on which rag flock is manufactured or stored. The sanitary authority has no discretion in the matter of registration of premises for the use of filling materials and must register all premises for which application is made. Once registered these premises remain so for all time although it is necessary for the Authority to be notified of a change of occupier. A sanitary authority may refuse to license premises and, if they do so, must give notice of their decision to the applicant and, if required, a statement of the grounds for their refusal, A person aggrieved by a local authority's refusal to license the premises may appeal to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. The Act contains powers enabling the Minister to make regulations with regard to the forms of records to be kept on registered and licensed premises, the standards of cleanliness applicable to the various types of filling materials to which the Act relates, fees to be charged by the analysts applying the appropriate tests and the appointment of analysts to carry out these tests. The Rag Flock and Other Pilling Materials Regulations, 1951, made by the Minister, came into operation on the 1st November, 1951, Premises registered for the use of filling materials of the types listed under Section 33 of the Act in manufacturing bedding, toys, baby carriages and other articles of upholstery totalled 36. There were no premises where rag flock was manufactured but one premises was licensed for storage. All the premises concerned were visited and no contraventions of the Act or the Regulations made thereunder were found. Six samples of filling materials were subjected to the appropriate tests prescribed by the Rag Flock and Other Pilling Materials Regulations, 1951, and found to be satisfactory. The Chiltern Research Laboratories, Limited, one of the analysts prescribed by the Regulations, carried out these tests. HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952 This Act, which is framed to prevent accidents in the home by prohibiting the sale or letting of certain heating appliances without effective guards received the Royal Assent on the 1st April, 1952, but did not come into operation until the 23rd March, 1953. Under the provisions of the Act the Secretary of State is required to make regulations regarding the types of guards to be fitted to heating appliances. These Regulations have since been made and became operative on the 1st October, 1953. A summary of the work of sanitary inspection is set out on Pages 8 and 9 of the Appendix. 29 HOUSING HOUSING ACT, 1936 PART II (Provisions for securing the repair, maintenance and sanitary condition of houses) Section 4 (Information to tenants). The several sanitary inspectors reported 16 instances of failure to include in rent books the name and address of the Medical Officer of Health and/or the landlord or other person responsible for keeping the house in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation. Notices drawing attention to the omissions and warning that failure to comply with the requirements of the section would result in legal proceedings were sent to the persons concerned. Section 6 (London County Council Byelaws as to Lodging Houses for the WorkingClasses). Three summonses, twodealing with lighting of common staircases and one with cleaning of parts of house in communal use, were issued; in two instances a penalty and costs was imposed and in the third case a penalty without costs. Sections 9 & 10 (Repair of insanitary houses), Reconditioning of houses under Section 9 was considerably curtailed because the three Sanitary Inspectors seconded to this work had left the service of the Council. In the circumstances the Senior Housing Inspector concentrated on securing compliance with notices previously served rather than carrying out large scale initial inspections of other properties. Eleven houses were inspected and found to be in some respects unfit for habitation; two informal notices and nine formal notices were served. In addition, 31 formal notices were served in respect of houses inspected in 1951, making a total of 40 notices served during the year. In all, 174 houses were made fit, 63 as a result of informal action and 111 following formal action. Seventy seven of these 111 houses were made fit by the owners while the Council, in pursuance of their default powers, carried out the whole of the work required by notices at 22 houses, and at 12 houses the work left outstanding by the owners. Five notices were withdrawn, the properties having been acquired under a Compulsory Purchase Order. properties having been acquired under a Compulsory Purchase Order. The total cost of the work carried out by the Council at the 34 houses was £3,905 10s. 2d: £ s. d. 25, Ballance Road 108 12 6 36, Ballance Road 153 4 10 *21, Bushberry Road 5 0 0 *24, Bushberry Road 28 4 0 67, Cazenove Road 703 12 2 75, Clapton Way 182 3 6 64, Colvestone Crescent 272 6 9 5, Cottrill Road 107 10 6 7, Cottrill Road 126 2 6 9, Cottrill Road 13 7 6 11, Cottrill Road 41 4 6 13, Cottrill Road 32 17 6 13, Gilpin Road 144 12 0 *1/20, Great Eastern Buildings 137 12 0 la, Hassett Road 88 14 0 2a, Hassett Road 59 12 0 3a, Hassett Road 38 13 0 4a, Hassett Road 22 10 0 *4, King Edward's Road 238 5 7 9, Lamb Lane 134 5 0 3, London Fields, East Side 182 15 0 1, Mehetabel Road 178 11 3 39, Montague Road .. 168 4 0 35, Rectory Road 564 6 1 13, Riseholme Street 18 10 0 7, Sheep Lane 124 17 6 *15, Sylvester Road 29 16 0 *Work completed partly by owners and partly by Council, 30 In the majority of cases in which notices were served the owners were not unwilling to carry out the work but were unable to meet the expense involved and requested the Council to carry out the necessary work on their behalf. Generally, formal notices were served because agents could only carry out work on receipt of such notices, or because the service of a formal notice was a necessary preliminary to the Council carrying out the work. The table on Page 10 of the Appendix shows the works of repair executed incompliance with formal and informal notices served. Section 11 (Demolition Orders). Demolition Orders were made by the Council in respect of three houses, 48 and 60, Lamb Lane and 62, Templar Road. In lieu of making a Demolition Order the Council accepted from the owner of 4, Stamford Road an Undertaking to cease using the basement front room for human habitation, and to make the remainder of the house fit. The following five houses, the subject of Demolition Orders made in previous years, were demolished:- 132 and 134, Shacklewell Lane, 38, Tresham Avenue, 3 and 329, Wick Road. In the case of 329, Wick Road, the property was demolished by the Council at a cost of £160, which was reimbursed by the War Damage Commission. Section 12 (Closing Orders). Closing Orders were made in respect of basement rooms at:- 98, Cazenove Road (basement back East and West rooms and kitchen) 58, Ravensdale Road (Basement front and back rooms) 185, Well Street (basement front and back rooms) Instead of making Closing Orders undertakings, as indicated, were accepted in respect of:- 19A, Amhurst Park (Undertaking to make the basement East front, middle and back rooms fit for human habitation). 94, Reighton Road (Undertaking to use basement back room as kitchen). Section 15 (Appeals). There were no appeals against notices served under Section 9. One appeal was lodged against a demand for the payment of expenses incurred in carrying out in the owner's default work required by a notice served under Section 9; at the end of the year the date for the hearing of this appeal had not been fixed. An appeal was lodged against a Demolition Order made in 1951 in respect of 22, East Side, London Fields. In this case the Council had refused to accept an Undertaking to use the premises concerned for storage purposes. The appeal was heard at Shoreditch County Court on the 7th March, 1952, but was adjourned until the 17th March to enable both parties in the matter to reconsider the position. On this latter date the Judge made an Order embodying an undertaking agreed between the Council and the owner, and the owner, having substantially succeeded in his appeal, was awarded two-thirds of his costs. PART III (Slum Clearance) By the end of 1939 the first two five-year programmes for dealing with slum clearance as required by the Housing Act, 1930 had been carried into effect and the worst of the slum property in the Borough demolished. A third fiveyear programme was drawn up in 1939, but the outbreak of war, with the resultant suspension of all housing operations, prevented further progress in slum 31 clearance. When the war ended in 1945 damage to and deterioration of London housing was so extensive that it was obvious some years must elapse before slum clearance could be resumed; the acute housing shortage made it imperative that any dwelling capable of providing reasonable shelter be retained in use. However, such was the progress made in repairing war damaged houses and the erection of new dwellings that by 1949 it seemed possible that some plan for resuming slum clearance could be prepared, and in March of that year a Conference of officers of the Ministry of Health, the London County Council and the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee was held. At that conference stress was laid on the necessity for resuming slum clearance as part of a co-ordinated plan for the provision of housing accommodation in London in order that housing operations in the County should not be curtailed because of lack of suitable sites. The Conference decided among other things to obtain a return of clearance areas represented by the various Councils prior to the war and which had not been dealt with. Following these discussions, and after consultation with the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee, the London County Council requested information from the Metropolitan Borough Councils regarding their immediate post-war clearance programmes. A survey was carried out in Hackney and after making allowances for the properties included in Compulsory Purchase Orders, a provisional programme including some 966 dwelling houses was submitted to the London County Council. Further conferences were held which culminated in the framing of a fiveyear programme of slum clearance on an all county basis involving 10,131 houses, of which 6,686 were to be cleared by the London County Council and 3,445 by the Borough Councils in the five years 1951-1955. The marked disparity in the allocation to the various Councils caused some surprise as it appeared that the Boroughs had not been dealt with on a basis of equality; the explanation was that the guiding principle had been to deal first with the worst areas and, therefore, some disparity was inevitable. With regard to Hackney the proposals envisaged 93 houses only as ripe for clearance during this five-year period; of this number 24 houses contained in five small areas to be dealt with by the Borough Council and the remaining 69, in three areas, by the London County Council. Inspection of the proposed areas revealed that 5 of the 24 houses allocated to the Borough Council were included in a compulsory purchase area, while other properties could for various reasons be left over for the time being. At a later meeting between representatives of the London County Council and the Borough Council it was agreed that the five houses included in the compulsory purchase area could be deleted from the programme and a further 20 houses to be selected could be dealt with, making a total of 39 houses to be cleared in the given neriod 1951-1955. The following four areas included in the finally agreed programme were represented during the year:- Area No, of Houses No. of inhabitants Jackson's Buildings 4 13 Shacklewell Lane 3 12 Wardle Street 6(1 unoccupied) 12 Wallis Road 3 9 The position at the end of the year in regard to the agreed proposals was that 16 houses had been represented, leaving two areas containing 7 houses to be dealt with and a further 16 houses to be selected as suitable for slum clearance. A summary of action taken under the Housing Act, 1936 is set out on page 11 of the Appendix. 32 PART IV (Abatement of Overcrowding) (a) (i) Number of dwellings overcrowded at the end of the year 732 (ii) Number of families dwelling therein 1,156 (iii) Number of persons dwelling therein 4,755 (b) Number of new cases of overcrowding reported during the year 136 (c) (i) Number of cases of overcrowding relieved during the year 136 (ii) Number of persons concerned in such cases 673 (d) Particulars of any cases in which dwelling-houses have again become overcrowded after the local, authority have taken steps for the abatement of overcrowding NIL The continual movement of population during and since the war years has made it impossible to maintain the overcrowding records with complete accuracy and failing a systematic survey similar to that undertaken in the Borough in 1935-1936 the extent of overcrowding can only be estimated in relation to enquiries received for housing accommodation by the London County Council, the Hackney Borough Council and the Public Health Department. In these circumstances the pre-War figures relating to overcrowding have been deemed to be of no value in assessing the extent of overcrowding prevailing at the present time, and the figures quoted refer only to cases of overcrowding which have come to the notice of the Department since 1945, as a result of applications made to the various housing authorities and through the medium of reports from sanitary inspectors and health visitors and from enquiries received in the Public Health Department. This has been considered the most practicable method of arriving at a current register, bearing in mind the probability that most families recorded in the overcrowding register before 1945 will have renewed their applications more recently. The number of overcrowded dwellings on the register at the end of the year was 732, a figure which was the same as for the previous year since although overcrowding was abated in 136 dwellings the same number of new overcrowded dwellings was entered on the register. Overcrowding in 100 dwellings was abated by rehousing, in 68 instances by the London County Council and in 32 instances by the Borough Council. In the remaining dwellings the overcrowding was abated by families removing privately, or by marriages, deaths, etc., in the families concerned. In addition to these dwellings in which overcrowding as defined by Section 58 of the Act was found to exist, there were again many families sharing accommodation which, when related to the total number of occupants of the dwelling, was not statutorily overcrowded. Shared accommodation, with its attendant inconvenience and discomfort, and resulting, as it so often does, in discord and mental strain, constitutes a social problem of no small magnitude which will not be solved until housing accommodation sufficient to provide each family with a separate dwelling is available. PART V (Provision of Housing Accommodation) New dwellings completed by the Council totalled 357, and a further 263 dwellings were under construction at the end of the year. Since 1920 a total of 4,181 dwellings including 657 temporary hutments and bungalows have been completed. Seventy-five temporary hutments were demolished during the year. At the end of the year 1,918 properties housing 3,628 families were held under requisitioning powers. The London County Council has since 1920 erected some 4,000 units of living accommodation. Housing Applications. New applications for housing accommodation added to the Council's Housing Department's register totalled 2,000, and at the end of the year 6,402 applicants were on the register. 33 The London County Council refer to Borough Medical Officers of Health applications for rehousing received from persons who appear to be living in overcrowded conditions, for the submission, in appropriate cases, of a certificate of overcrowding. Of a total of 222 such applications referred to the department overcrowding was found to exist in 129 instances. In a further 260 instances the London County Council notified cases in which the applicants alleged that their accommodation was in an insanitary condition. All the premises were inspected and appropriate action taken to secure the remedy of any defects found. Families to the number of 1,531 were rehoused, 873 by the Borough Council, and 658 by the London County Council. Thirty-two of the families rehoused by the Borough Council were recommended by this Department on grounds of overcrowding and one on health grounds: with regard to the families rehoused by the London County Council the corresponding figures are 68 and 6 respectively. HOUSING ACT, 1949 This Act, which came into operation on the 30th July, 1949, inter alia removed the references to the working classes from certain provisions of the Housing Act, 1936, and enables action to be taken under Section 9 (repair), Section 11 (demolition) and Section 12 (closing) in respect of all houses. It also empowers the local authority to provide housing accommodation for persons of all classes. Under Section 4 of the Act, a local authority is enabled to make advances to any persons for the purpose of:- (a) acquiring houses; (b) constructing houses; (c) converting into houses buildings which have been acquired by those persons or acquiring buildings and converting them into houses; or (d) altering, enlarging, repairing or improving houses; whether the houses or buildings are within or without the district of the authority or council. Subject to certain conditions, a local authority may under Section 20 of the Act give assistance in respect of:- (a) the provision of dwellings, by a person other than a local authority or county council, by means of the conversion of houses or other buildings; (b) the improvement of dwellings by such a person by way of making a grant. In twelve instances the Council made advances under Section 4(1) (a) of the Act. RENT AND MORTGAGE INTEREST RESTRICTIONS ACTS, 1920 TO 1929 On the application of occupiers 19 certificates of disrepair were issued. In six cases certificates previously issued were revoked as the necessary work had been carried out. DEFENCE REGULATION 68CA (Use of residential accommodation for business purposes) Sixteen applications to use residential accommodation for business purposes were considered by the Council, but only three were granted. Six of the eight appeals made to the Minister of Housing and Local Government were upheld. 34 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (Under the Public Health and Housing Acts and Byelaws) Legal proceedings were instituted in 230 cases, including 29 summonses in respect of dwellings in one block of flats, an increase of 46 on the previous year. In the cases of 21 properties, Nuisance Orders were obtained to enable the Council to carry out work on owners' behalf. In common with other Metropolitan Borough Councils, Hackney experienced difficulty in securing the abatement of nuisances existing in some premises where ownership was difficult to establish. In these cases the difficulty was met by serving notices addressed to "the owner and then obtaining Nuisance Orders and carrying out the work in default, the expenses incurred in so doing becoming a charge on the premises in accordance with the provisions of Section 8 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1951. In one case the department experienced considerable difficulties which resulted in the lapse of 18 months between the service of a Statutory Notice and the completion of the necessary work. In this case a Statutory Notice was served on the 21st September, 1951, and a summons was issued which was returnable on the 7th December, 1951. For various reasons this owner was able to secure adjournment of the hearing of the summons from time to time, and it was not until the 8th July, 1952, that a Nuisance Order requiring the work to be completed in three months was obtained. Six days later and before the Order had been served by the Court, the owner made an application to the Magistrate for "a case to be stated. "This application was granted and so no further action could be taken until the statutory three months in which the case was required to be stated had expired. The position was further complicated by the fact that because of the application for a case to be stated the Nuisance Order was not served by the Police. On the 6th October the owner informed the Court that he did not intend to proceed with his appeal and asked for the Nuisance Order to be served. It will be seen that since a summons for non-compliance with the Magistrate's Order could not be taken out until three months after the date on which the Order was served, this owner gained a three-months extension of the time within which the Magistrate had first ordered him to complete the necessary works. After the Order had been served the living conditions of the tenants of this house were further worsened by the exposure to the weather of several rooms, and it was necessary to serve a further notice upon the owner requiring him to protect these rooms. This notice was not complied with and two further summonses were issued; one to obtain a Nuisance Order, and the other for non-compliance with the second Statutory Notice. In respect of the first summons an Order was made requiring the abatement of the nuisance within two days and for the payment of 5 guineas costs. On the second summons, a penalty of £5 0s. 0d. was inflicted but no costs were awarded. The facts of this particular case are given in some detail to illustrate how difficult an unco-operative owner of property can make the work of the Public Health Department. In such circumstances as these it is not easy to satisfy the occupier of a house in need of repair that the local authority is carrying out its statutory duties. One, however, is glad to record that owners of this type form a very small minority so far as Hackney is concerned. Details of the results of the 230 summonses heard were: Judgments obtained 185 Withdrawn 41 Summons not served 3 Non-appearance of Defendant 1 230 In 28 of the 41 cases withdrawn the Council's costs were paid. 35 The following is a summary of the results of legal proceedings:PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, SECTION 82 AND THE FIFTH SCHEDULE (NUISANCES) Abatement Orders with costs 122 Abatement Orders without costs 9 Work carried out, costs awarded 19 Closing Order with costs 1 Closing Order without costs 1 Dismissed, no costs awarded 1 Work carried out, withdrawn on payment of costs 25 Withdrawn, without costs: Work completed before service of summons 6 Defendant bankrupt 1 Defendant deceased 2 Work completed but no proof of ownership 1 Work completed, Inspector concerned left Council's service 1 Summons not proceeded with, pending settlement of war damage claim 1 Summons not served 3 NON-COMPLIANCE WITH MAGISTRATES' ORDERS: Penalties and costs 15 Work carried out, costs awarded 1 Withdrawn, defendant bankrupt 1 NON-COMPLIANCE WITH STATUTORY NOTICES: Penalty without costs 4 SECTION 34 (DRAINAGE BYELAWS) - CONTRAVENTIONS Penalties and costs 5 Penalty without costs 1 Non-appearance of defendant, warrant for appearance sworn 1 SECTION 107 (ASHPIT BYELAWS) - CONTRAVENTIONS Dustbin supplied, summons withdrawn on payment of costs 3 SECTION 107 (WATER CLOSET BYELAWS) - CONTRAVENTIONS Penalty and costs 2 SECTION 109 (DISCONTINUANCE OF WATER SUPPLY) - CONTRAVENTIONS Penalty and costs 1 HOUSING ACT, SECTION 6 (BYELAWS AS TO HOUSES FOR THE WORKING CLASSES) CONTRAVENTIONS Penalty and costs 2 Penalty without costs 1 Full details of these proceedings are set out in pages 12 to 20 of the Appendix. 36 ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION AND SMOKE ABATEMENT The Council's powers for dealing with nuisances arising from the emission of smoke are contained in Sections 147-154 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. In Section 148 the expression "Chimney" includes every structure or opening of any kind whatsoever capable of emitting smoke, and the expression "smoke" includes "soot, ash, grit and gritty particles", "Smoke Nuisances" are defined as:- (a) any fireplace or furnace which does not, as far as practicable, consume the smoke arising from the combustible used therein, and which is used for working engines by steam, or in any mill, factory, dyehouse, brewery, bakehouse or gaswork, or in any manufacturing or trade process whatsoever: (b) any chimney (not being the chimney of a private dwelling-house or the chimney of a ship habitually used as a sea-going ship) sending forth smoke in such quantity as to be a nuisance; and (c) any chimney of a ship habitually used as a sea-going ship sending forth black smoke in such a quantity as to be a nuisance. In the case of a person against whom a complaint under (a) is made to the Court it is a defence to show that a fireplace or furnace is constructed in such manner as to consume as far as is practicable, having regard to the nature of the manufacture or trade, all smoke arising therefrom, and that the fireplace or furnace has been carefully attended to by the person having charge thereof. It is also a defence for a person charged under (b) to show that he has used the best practicable means for preventing the nuisance having regard to cost and to local conditions and circumstances. This defence is restricted to a nuisance from smoke other than black smoke: when the smoke is black smoke, the defence is not available. The expression "best practicable means" refers not only to efficiency of the plant but also to the manner in which it is handled. The Inspector making smoke observations has to decide whether or not the emission of smoke in any particular circumstance constitutes a nuisance; the only legal definition is contained in the Byelaws made by the London County Council under the Public Health (Smoke Abatement) Act, 1926, and continued in force by the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, These Byelaws define "smoke nuisance" as the emission of black smoke for a period of two minutes in the aggregate within any continuous period of thirty minutes from any one chimney of a building other than a private dwelling-house. Buildings in which certain specified industrial processes are carried on are exempted from the provisions of the Byelaws. In view of the evil of atmospheric pollution with its attendant adverse effect on the public health, the prevention of nuisance from smoke is given considerable prominence in the activities of the Department. As almost 100 per cent of the complaints received relating to smoke nuisances are associated with factory premises, the Factories Inspector deals practically entirely with the matter of smoke abatement; in this work he has the assistance of an outdoor observer, who is a member of the drainage staff. Complaints of smoke nuisance to the number of 14 were received, and observations totalling 1,453 were made; intimation notices were served in respect of the 28 smoke nuisances found, and in eight of these cases it was necessary to serve statutory notices; the nuisances in question were abated without legal proceedings. In this connection I am glad to say that factory occupiers on the whole co-operated to the best of their ability in taking steps to remedy the unsatisfactory condi tions brought to their notice and were always ready to give effect to any suggestions made by the Council's Inspector. MEASUREMENT OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. Two stations for the purpose of measuring and recording the extent of atmospheric pollution in Hackney were in operation. The one provided by the Borough Council is sited on the roof of the Town Hall and comprises (a) a lead peroxide instrument which records the 37 amount of sulphur dioxide present in the atmosphere at a given point and functioned throughout the year; (b) a deposit gauge which measures the amount of solids that settle from the atmosphere and was in use from December 1952. The second station, provided by the London County Council, is situated at ground level in the old-world garden in Victoria Park within the boundary of Hackney and this station also comprises a deposit gauge and a lead peroxide instrument. In May of the current year a third station was set up by the Borough Council on the roof of Buccleuch House, Clapton Common. Calculations of the pollution as recorded by the various instruments are made by the Council's public analyst at the end of each month, and a summary of the findings and observations included in the Atmospheric Pollution Bulletin of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. The seriousness of the problem of atmospheric pollution, which for many years has caused great concern to all health authorities, was in 1952 in no uncertain manner emphasised by the high mortality resulting from the exceptionally severe fogs experienced in the last month of the year. Conditions were at their worst from December 5th to December 8th and deaths for the week ending December 13th showed a greater increase over the normal for the time of the year than in any comparable period in the last 100 years, with the exception of the Influenza epidemic of 1918. In the very interesting and informative report made to the County Council Dr. Scott, the County Medical Officer, pointed out that the amount of sulphur dioxide present in the atmosphere during the fog was seven times greater than the normal, while the smoke content was nine times that of the normal. The following table of weekly deaths registered for the administrative County of London and Hackney for the period from 16th November, 1952 to 10th January, 1953, shows the startling sudden rise in the week of the fog. Deaths registered Week ended (1952) County of London Hackney 22nd November 753 43 29th " 853 48 6th December 945 58 13th " (Fog week) 2,484 143 20th " 1,523 74 27th " 1,029 60 Week ended (1953) 3rd January 1,372 64 10th " 1,216 73 Dr. Scott notes, too, that the increase was associated almost entirely with disorders of the respiratory and circulatory systems and was not confined to any particular age group, though the greatest increases occurred among infants and elderly People. A table showing comparison between the numbers and age groups of deaths from respiratory and circulatory diseases occurring in Hackney during the week of the fog, and the immediately preceding and succeeding weeks, with the corresponding weeks in 1951, is given below:- Week ending AGE GROUPS Total 0 to 1 1 to 5 5 to 15 15 to 25 25 to 45 45 to 65 65 to 75 75 and over 1951: 8th Dec. - - - - - 2 2 1 5 15th Dec. - - - - 1 1 4 7 13 22nd Dec. - - - - - 5 7 7 19 37 1952: 6th Dec. - - - - - 4 8 3 15 13th Dec, (Fog week) - - - - 4 16 30 43 93 20th Dec - - - - - 11 10 19 40 148 FACTORIES AND OUTWORK (Factories Act, 1937) FACTORIES. The Council is responsible for arranging for the inspection of factories in the Borough with a view to seeing that the requirements of Sections 1 to 7 and any Regulations made thereunder are enforced. The sections in question deal with cleanliness, overcrowding, temperature, ventilation, drainage of floors, and sanitary conveniences. In factories where, however, power is used the local authority is only responsible for the section dealing with the provision and maintenance of sanitary conveniences. SECTION 5 enacts that effective provision shall be made for securing and maintaining sufficient and suitable lighting, but this matter is dealt with entirely by H.M. Inspector of Factories. SECTION 8 provides that every district council shall keep a register of all factories situate within their area. SECTION 107 deals with works of building and engineering construction and, under the heading of "Building operations", includes building operations under taken by way of trade or business or for the purpose of any industrial or commercial undertaking. Such works can, generally speaking, be described as factories in which mechanical power is used, and the local authority is responsible for seeing that sufficient and suitable sanitary conveniences are provided for the persons employed. By the terms of SECTION 128 the Medical Officer of Health of every district council shall, in his annual report to the authority, report on the administration of the sections of the Act for which the authority is responsible and send a copy of his annual report, or so much of it as deals with those matters, to the Secretary of State. He is also under an obligation to give written notice to H.M. Inspector of Factories for the district of any factory coming to his knowledge in which no abstract of the Act is affixed as provided for in Section 114. The Secretary of State, if satisfied that any district council have failed to enforce any of the provisions of the Act enforceable by them, may by Order authorise one of Her Majesty's Inspectors to take such steps as appear necessary or proper for enforcing those provisions. At the end of the year there were 1,549 factories in the Council's register; they varied in type from small premises employing two or three people to those employing 600. The principal industry in Hackney is the manufacture of clothing, and the largest factories are engaged in the manufacture of chemicals, furniture, paint, cardboard boxes, shoes, plastic and rubber articles, fountain pens, electric lamps, and clothing. The Department frequently receives complaints of alleged nuisances caused as a result of factory operations; they, in the main, deal with such matters as noise from machinery, smoke, fumes, effluvia and trade refuse. It will be appreciated that industrial nuisances can on occasion have a serious effect on the health and wellbeing of persons residing or working in the vicinity. All complaints made to the Department are very carefully investigated and much time is taken up in making contact with executives, works managers and other persons in an endeavour to get to the source of the trouble and to secure the prompt alleviation of the circumstances complained of. In this connection I am very happy to report that in the vast majority of cases the fullest possible co-operation is received from those concerned. During the year there was considerable activity in connection with alter ations and additions to factories in the Borough. These works involved, in many cases, industrial plumbing and drainage on a large scale and necessitated regular and frequent visits to ensure that requirements of the various drain age by-laws were properly carried out. 39 H.M. Inspectors of Factories are responsible for seeing that the requirements of the Act other than those dealt with by the local authority are enforced, and where on their visits they find contraventions of Sections 1 to 7 they bring them to our notice. From the above summary of the Council's obligations in relation to the large number of factories in this Borough it will be appreciated that a task of some considerable magnitude is involved. HOME WORK - OUTWORKERS The Secretary of State, by Regulation, specifies the classes of work to which the provisions of the sections of the Act relating to home work shall be applied. SECTION 110 provides that the occupier of every factory, and every contractor employed by any such occupier in the business of the factory shall keep, in prescribed form, lists showing the names and addresses of persons referred to as "outworkers" directly employed by him, either as workmen or as contractors, in the business of the factory, outside the factory and of the places where they are employed. The Section also directs that during the months of February and August in each year copies of these lists, showing all outworkers so employed by him during the preceding six months, shall be sent to the Council. SECTION 111 provides that, where home work is carried on in any place which in the opinion of the Council is injurious or dangerous to the health of the persons employed therein, the Council may give notice in writing to the occupier of the factory or to any contractor employed by him setting out particulars of the respects in which the place is injurious or dangerous to health. If at the expiration of ten days from receipt of the notice the occupier of a factory, or contractor, gives out work to be done in such a place, he shall be, unless it is proved to the contrary, guilty of an offence Part II of the Third Schedule of the Act sets out the provisions relating to the carrying out of home work in premises where there is Scarlet Fever, Smallpox or other infectious disease. 1.

Basement Bakehouses. This section defines a "basement bakehouse" as a bakehouse any baking room of which is so situated that the surface of the floor is more than three feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street or of the ground adjoining or nearest to the room: and baking room" as any room used for baking, or for any process incidental thereto; and enacts (1) A basement bakehouse shall not be used as a bakehouse unless it was so used at the date of the passing of this Act and a certificate of suitability had been issued by the district council under an enactment repealed by this Act in respect there of. 42 (2) Any basement bakehouse which, for a period exceeding twelve months, is not used as a bakehouse shall not be so used again. (3) It shall be the duty of every district council to carry out, in the year beginning at the date of the commencement of this Act and in every fifth succeeding year after that year, an examination of every basement bakehouse in respect of which a certificate of suitability has been issued. (4) If as the result of the examination the council are not satisfied that the bakehouse is suitable for use as such as regards construction, height, light, ventilation, and any hygienic respect, they shall give notice in writing that the certificate shall cease to have effect after the expiration of such period, being not less than one month, as may be specified in the notice, and the basement bakehouse shall not be used as a bakehouse after the expiration of that period. (5) If the council are satisfied that the bakehouse is suitable as regards the matters aforesaid, they shall give notice in writing that the certificate shall continue to operate so long as the bakehouse may otherwise lawfully be used, but without prejudice to the power of the council to revoke the certificate as the result of a subsequent examination under this subsection. The occupier may appeal to a court of summary jurisdiction against the decision of the local authority to terminate the certificate and may further appeal to the Quarter Sessions. The last quinquennial examination of the 27 basement bakehouses then in use was carried out in 1948, and certificates of suitability were granted in respect of 21 premises. On the 1st January only 18 of the basement bakehouses remained in use. During the year the use of two further premises was discontinued, leaving the following 16 in operation at the end of the year: 239 Amhurst Road 36 Chatsworth Road 94 Chatsworth Road 72 Dalston Lane 178 Dalston Lane 48 De Beauvoir Road 167 Homerton High Street 69 Kingsland High Street 71 Lower Clapton Road 200 Lower Clapton Road 106 Oldhill Street 33 Rectory Road 174 Southgate Road 18 Upper Clapton Road 186 Well Street 81 Wilton Way The Certificate of Suitability granted in respect of one of the underground bakehouses still in use has ceased to have effect, but the Council has from time to time extended the period of occupation to enable the occupier to find suitable alternative premises. The circumstances relating to this bakehouse will be taken into consideration when the results of the survey now being made are reported to the Public Health Committee. The number of inspections of basement bakehouses made totalled 36, and no defects or conditions were found which called for any statutory action by the Department. 43 INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD AND FOOD PREMISES FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS, 1938-1950 A considerable proportion of the time of the staff of the Department is devoted to the inspection of food and all types of food premises with a view to seeing that the public are sold clean and safe food. All district sanitary inspectors are concerned with this matter of clean food, and two specialist food inspectors devote the whole of their time to ensuring that the various Acts, Orders and Regulations relating to food are complied with With regard to the clean food campaign, additional and very valuable powers, more especially in regard to "the observance of sanitary and cleanly conditions and practices in connection with the handling, wrapping and delivery of food sold or intended for sale for human consumption, and in connection with the sale or exposure for sale in the open air of food intended for human consumption", are contained in the London County Council By-laws for the Protection of Food made under Section 15 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, which came into operation on 3rd November, 1952. Apart from the aesthetic angle, the increase in outbreaks of Food Poisoning in recent years, due in large part to the increase in popularity of communal feeding, has given much prominence to the need for more cleanly and hygienic methods in the handling of food generally. One is glad to report that persons engaged in the food trades are now more alive to the need for higher standards and, as a result, are co-operating more satisfactorily with the officers of the Department. Records are held in the Department relating to 1585 premises in the Borough where 2283 food trades are carried on; and listed as follows: - Bakehouses 35 Bakehouses (basement) 16 Bakers (sales only) 24 Butchers 131 Confectionery 389 Fish curers 19 Fish (wet) 37 Fish (fried) 29 Fish (wet and fried) 5 Greengrocers 132 Grocery and Provisions 392 Ice Cream 328 Jellied eels and pies 13 Milk (distributors) 206 Beer, Wine &c. "Off" sales at Grocers 18 Public Houses and Off Licences 268 Restaurants and cafes 241 Distribution of food trades in sanitary inspection districts, is shown on Page 21 of the Appendix. STREET TRADING IN FOODSTUFFS. The majority of street traders operate from approved pitches and are licensed by the Borough Council under Section 24 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1947. These pitches are the responsibility of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department and are supervised by streets inspectors employed in that Department. The Public Health Department is always consulted before persons proposing to sell foodstuffs are licensed, and it is recommended that licences be granted for the sale of certain foodstuffs only when they are sold in pre-packed 44 containers or otherwise adequately protected from contamination The places of storage are also visited before these traders are licensed: in this connection it is often necessary to seek the co-operation of Health Departments of other Boroughs. Street traders selling foodstuffs were frequently visited by the food inspectors and the following were licensed at December 31st: Foods tuffs Place of trading Total No. of StalIs Ridley Road Chatsworth Road Well Street Kingsland Road Broadway MiscelI.

Prohibition against sale of any food or drug not of the nature, substance or quality demanded. Twenty-six complaints of foreign bodies in various types of foodstuffs were received. After investigation legal action was taken in the two following cases:- Offence Result of proceedings Selling a pie containing a piece of hide. Defendants were granted an absolute discharge on payment of £10 10s. 0d. costs, Selling a loaf of bread containing an adhesive bandage. Defendants were granted an absolute discharge on payment of £5 5s. 0d. costs. SECTION 8. (a) Public Health (Meat) Regulations, i924-i94£. These Regulations apply to the slaughtering and inspection of animals for human consumption, the transport and handling of meat, and the hygienic condition of premises and stalls on which meat is stored, sold or exposed for sale. Complaints have been received in regard to carelessness in handling of meat during transport from wholesalers' stores to retailers' premises. This matter has been followed up and contact made with the Meat Transport Organisation Ltd., Agents for H.M. Government for the road transport of meat and livestock. From observations made in the current year it is considered that although occasional lapses may occur, the standard of handling of meat during transport is, on the whole, satisfactory. 45 (b) Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1937-1948. These Regulations deal with the quality of imported foodstuffs and give the Medical Officer of Health authority to examine any article of food before or after it has been landed.. They also prohibit the importation of meat not accompanied by an "official certificate". SECTION 9, Penalty for sale, &c. of unsound food. This section provides that a person who sells, offers, exposes for sale, or has in his possession for the purpose of sale or of preparation for sale, or deposits with, or consigns to, any person for the purpose of sale or of preparation for sale, any food intended for, but unfit for, human consumption shall be guilty of an offence* Legal proceedings under this section were taken in respect of unsound food at one premises, one summons against the Company for being in possession of the unsound food, and another against a servant of the Company for exposing such unsound food. Details are as follows:- Offence Result of proceedings Did have in possession for the purpose of sale two pieces of diseased horse liver, intended for, but unfit for, human consumption Pined £5 and £3 3s. 0d, costs. Did expose for sale two pieces of diseased horse liver, intended for, but unfit for, human consumption. Fined £2 and £1 costs. SECTION 10. Examination of food and seizure of unsound food. This section enables an authorised officer of a local authority at all reasonable times to examine any food intended for human consumption which has been sold, or is offered or exposed for sale or is in the possession of, or has been deposited with, or consigned to any person for the purpose of sale, and if it appears to be unfit for human consumption he may seize it and remove it in order to have it dealt with by a Justice of the Peace, Pour pounds of diseased horse liver intended for human consumption were seized and taken before a magistrate for condemnation; this is the case referred to under Section 9. The bulk of unfit food was, however, voluntarily surrendered and the total weights of food condemned or surrendered were:- ] Tens Cwts. Qtrs. Lbs. Bread, cakes and pastries - 2 - 18¼ Butter, lard and margarine - - 1 22 Cereals - - - 10 Cheese and cheese spread - 1 - - Cooked ham (tinned) 1 2 2 19 Eggs and dried egg powder - 1 7½ Pish 1 6 1 27 Fruit and Vegetables 11 14 2 17½ Jam, Marmalade and conserves. - 1 1 11½ Meat, poultry and game (carcase) 1 18 2 20 Meat, poultry and game (tinned). 2 15 - 27½ Milk (evaporated and condensed). - 9 - 16 Pickles and sauces - - 3 6½ Tea and coffee - 1 » 22 Miscellaneous 1 8 - 15½ 21 2 1 16½ 46 The main causes which rendered condemnation necessary were:- Ham and meat (tinned) "Blowing" due to unsatisfactory processing and storage. Fruit and vegetables "Blowing" of tins due to "Hydrogen swell"; unsoundness. Fish Decomposition. Meat (carcase) "Heated" condition and decomposition. SECTION 13. Provisions as to rooms where food intended for sale is prepared or stored, &c. This section deals with provisions in regard to hygiene, cleanliness, washing facilities, etc., in rooms where food is prepared for sale or sold, or offered or exposed for sale, or deposited for the sale or preparation for sale. Notices relating to defects under this section were served in respect of the following premises:- Baker 9 Butcher 1 Cafe and restaurant 16 Confectionery 13 Fishmonger 7 Greengrocery 11 Grocery and provisions 16 Public Houses 16 89 Defects as set out hereunder were included in the notices served:- Absence of dust and refuse bins 3 Absence of hot water supply 17 Accumulation of refuse 11 Dirty condition of premises 6 Food inadequately protected against contamination. 4 General structur a 1 defects 2 Inadequate ventilation 8 Insanitary condition of water closet 15 Insufficient dust and refuse bins 2 Insufficient supply of hot water 12 Insufficient heating 3 Lack of washing facilities 5 Water closet communicating directly with food room 2 Legal proceedings were taken in two cases:- Failing to keep rooms used for the preparation for sale and the sale of food in a thorough state of cleanliness. Adjourned sine die, Being the owner did not maintain in a state of thorough cleanliness rooms used for the preparation, storage and sale of food. Summons withdrawn and a nuisance order obtained under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. SECTION 14. Registration of premises used in connection with the manufacture or sale of ice cream or preserved food &c. This section provides for the registration by the local authority of premises used in connection with the sale or the manufacture for the purpose of sale of ice cream intended for sale, or the preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food intended for sale. 47 (a) ICE CREAM. In connection with the retail sale of ice cream, 20 new applications for registration were approved, and at the end of the year the premises of 292 retailers were registered as well as those of 36 manufacturers. Samples of ice cream to the number of 39 were submitted for bacteriological examination (Methylene Blue Test) and were graded as follows:- Grade 1 19 Grade 2 12 Grade 3 3 Grade 4 5 Samples falling in Grades 1 and 2 are generally considered to be satisfactory: samples falling in Grades 3 and 4, more especially when they continue to fall into these grades, usually indicate faulty methods of treatment or handling and necessitate detailed investigation into all stages of manufacture and handling. Food Standards (Ice Cream) Order, 1951 and Food Standards (Ice Cream) (Amendment) Order, 1952. The Order of 1951, operative from 1st March, 1951 to 6th July, 1952, laid down the food content of ice cream to be not less than 5 per cent, fat, 10 per cent. sugar and 7½ per cent. milk solids other than fat. The Food Standards (Ice Cream) (Amendment) Order, 1952, was operative from 7th July, and provided that ice cream should contain not less than 4 per cent. fat, 10 per cent. sugar and 5 per cent. milk solids other than fat, Of the 30 samples submitted for analysis, under these Orders, one was found to be deficient in fat to the extent of 2.5 per cent. The vendor was sent a warning letter. Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Amendment Regulations, 1951. These Regulations, operative from 18th January, 1951, embody the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1947 and 1948, and broadly require that the ingredients of ice cream, other than a "complete cold mix", a product capable of manufacture into ice cream with the addition of water only, after mixing shall not be kept for more than one hour at any temperature which exceeds 45°F before being subjected to heat treatment in the following manner: raised to and kept at a temperature of not less than 150°F. for 30 minutes or alternatively of not less than 160°F. for 10 minutes and then reduced to a temperature of not more than 45°F within 1½ hours and shall be kept at such temperature until the freezing process is begun. Manufacturers of ice cream must use indicating and recording thermometers, and the records of the temperatures to or at which the ice cream is raised, kept or reduced shall be preserved for a period of not less than one month. The Regulations further require that ice cream shall not be sold unless it has been kept at a temperature not exceeding 28°F. since being frozen. (b) PREPARATION OR MANUFACTURE OF SAUSAGES OR POTTED, PRESSED, PICKLED OR PRESERVED FOOD INTENDED FOR SALE. At the end of the year 154 premises were registered:- Preservation of meat and manufacture of sausages 121 Curing of fish 19 Pickling of fish l Manufacture of meat pies and jellied eels 6 Manufacture of vinegar and non-brewed condiment. 3 Manufacture of pickles 1 Manufacture of potato crisps 3 SECTION 17. Notification of cases of Food Poisoning, Under this section a medical practitioner is required to send to the Medical Officer of Health Particulars of any person whom he is attending for Food Poisoning or for suspected Food Poisoning. Notifications relating to nine persons were received 48 and four cases were admitted to hospital In two instances, however, the diagnosis was not confirmed, so that the "corrected" figure of cases of Pood Poisoning for the year is seven, six adults and one child. Following detailed enquiries by officers of the department the notifications fell in the category of "single" cases and could not be described as "outbreaks". Enquiries into the clinical features of the cases showed that all patients experienced sickness and diarrhoea, varying from slight to severe attacks, and occurring at periods from 3 to 35 hours after consuming the suspected foods: all patients recovered. The foods coming under suspicion in six of the cases were:- Shell-fish (winkles) 2 cases Minced beef 1 case Tinned fish 1 case Tinned meat 1 case Duck egg 1 case In the seventh case, the illness could not be related to any particular article of food. As so often happens, no portion of the suspected foods was available for bacteriological examination. SECTION 20. (a) (Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949). Under this section the Minister has made various regulations relating to Milk and Dairies. Since the coming into operation of the various Milk Regulations, 1949, the responsibility of local authorities has been more particularly in relation to the safety of milk in distribution as opposed to the production side, which is in the hands of the National Agricultural Advisory Service. These Regulations require that local authorities keep a register of persons carrying on the trade of milk distributor and of all dairy premises other than dairy farms in their district, and make special provisions relating to the treatment, handling, and storage of milk. Shops where milk is sold only in the unopened containers in which it is received are not included in the definition of "dairy"; the vendors are registered as "distributors". At the end of the year 234 persons were registered as "distributors", 29 operating from registered "dairy premises" in the Borough, 28 from "dairy premises" outside the Borough, and 177 were selling from retail shops milk in unopened containers. (b) Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949/50. The following licences were issued:- Dealer's Licence - Tuberculin Tested Milk 46 Dealer's Supplementary Licence - Tuberculin Tested Milk 20 (c) Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949/50. The following licences were issued:- Pasteuriser's Licence 1 350 Steriliser's Licence 1 Dealer's Licence- Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised Milk 28 Pasteurised Milk 120 Sterilised Milk 200 Dealer's Supplementary Licence- 55 Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised 4 Pasteurised 24 Sterilised 27 Bacteriological examination of 540 samples of milk sold under these Regulations was carried out; seven of these samples failed to comply with the 49 requirements of the Methylene Blue Test, but in six instances the test was void because atmospheric shade temperature on day of sampling exceeded 65°P. The vendor of the unsatisfactory sample was warned and given advice to enable the cause of the adverse report to be rectified. One sample failed to satisfy the Phosphatase Test, which is the approved test for estimating the efficiency of heat treatment. The vendor of this sample was warned. The Sale of Milk Regulations, 1939. These regulations provide that milk shall contain not less than 3 per cent. milk-fat and 8.5 per cent. milk-solids other than milk-fat. The milk-fat content of the samples submitted throughout the year varied from 3.05 per cent. to 4.6 per cent: the average of all samples taken was 3.5 per cent. milk-fat, and 8.89 per cent. milk-solids other than milk-fat. Milk (Special Designations) (Specified Areas) Order, 1951. This Order, made under the Pood and Drugs (Milk, Dairies and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950, declared the County of London to be a "specified Area" as from 1st October, 1951. This means that from that date it was illegal for any person to sell by retail for human consumption any milk other than milk which may be sold as special designated milk in accordance with the provisions of the Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949 or the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949. SECTION 68. Powers of Sampling. Under this Section an authorised officer of a Pood and Drugs Authority is empowered to procure samples of food and drugs for analysis or for bacteriological or other examination and for that purpose may purchase samples of any food or drug. A total of 1056 samples of which 900 were formal and 156 informal were taken by the Food Inspectors for submission to the public analyst. The analyst's findings were:- Genuine Adulterated (a) Formal Milk 143 - Other foods 747 9 (plus one false description on label: acetic acid) (b) Informal Milk 126 - Other foods 29 1 A detailed statement of all foods analysed appears on pages 22 and 23 of the Appendix. Adulteration. The following are details of the nature and extent of adulteration of the nine formal samples and the action taken by the Council:- Description Nature and Extent of Adulteration Action taken 193 W. Coffee and Chicory Extract 8% deficient in Caffeine Manufacturer warned 268 W. Non-Brewed Condiment 1.25% deficient in Acetic Acid Manufacturer warned 20 G. Non-Brewed Condiment 12.5% deficient in Acetic Acid Manufacturer warned. Stock withdrawn from sale. 50 Description Nature and Extent of Adulteration Action taken 86 G. Orange Jelly 3.4% deficient in Sugar Manufacture warned 117 G. Butter 0. 4% Excess Water Vendor warned 132 G. Margarine 1.1% Excess Water Vendor warned 179 G. Strawberry Jam 0.7% deficient in soluble solids Manufacturer warned 55 N. Non-brewed Condiment 7. 5% deficient in Acetic Acid Manufacturer warned 102 N. Margarine 2. 7% Excess Water Wholesaler warned (Ministry of Food Product). Matter taken up by Wholesaler with Ministry of food. Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations. A sample of diluted Acetic Acid (202 W) taken in the course of routine sampling was found to bear a false statement on the label; particulars were submitted to the Ministry of Food, who were of the opinion that such a description could be held to be false for the purpose of these Regulations. A letter was sent warning the vendor of the offence. Merchandise Marks Act, 1926, This Act gave power for H.M. Government to make Orders in Council prohibiting the sale, or the exposure for sale in the United Kingdom, of imported goods unless they bear an indication of the country of origin. Over a period of years since the passing of the Act Orders have been made dealing with such products as fresh apples, currants, sultanas, raisins, eggs (hen or duck) in shell, dried eggs, oat products, raw tomatoes, bacon, ham, dead poultry, meat, margarine, malt products, frozen or chilled salmon and sea trout, butter and honey. During the 1939-45 War, however, many of the Orders were suspended, but all are again in operation, PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT, 1933 Under the provisions of this Act no person may sell poisons listed in Part II of the Poisons List unless his name is entered in a local authority's list of persons entitled to sell such poisons. The requirements which apply to the sale of poisons by a listed seller of Part II poisons are laid down in Section 18 of the Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933, and in the Poisons Rules, 1952, and are, briefly, as follows: The sale must be effected on the premises specified in the local authority's list. The container of the poison must be labelled with the various particulars and in the prescribed manner. No poison may be sold except in containers which comply with the requirements of the Rules. Certain specified poisons must not be sold by any person other than the listed shopkeeper himself, or a responsible deputy nominated by him to the local authority. The sale of certain specified poisons may be made only to persons satisfying the prescribed qualifications and must be entered in a Poisons Book to be kept by the listed seller and to be available for inspection by the local authority. Arrangements for storage must be satisfactory and in compliance with the prescribed methods. The names and addresses of 155 persons listed as sellers of Part II poisons remained on the register at the end of the year. The main business of these sellers was:- Grocer 105 Hardware store 42 Drug store 5 Hairdresser 1 Disinfectant manufacturer 1 Mill furnisher l No contraventions of the Act were reported. 51 WELFARE OF AGED PERSONS (National Assistance Acts, 1948 to 1951) In view of the continued ageing of our population, measures for the welfare of aged people constitute one of the nation's most important social services. The Public Health Committee displays very great interest in this matter and the staff of the Department are most assiduous in dealing with the cases which come to our notice. The County Council is the Welfare Authority and the Borough Council possesses limited powers. We are fortunate in Hackney in having a voluntary Association for the Welfare of Old People, which the Council supports and on which it is represented. During the year under review, under Section 31 of the Act a grant of £400 was made to this Association and also a special grant of £800 for the purchase of a suitable vehicle for use in the "meals on wheels" service. This service is one of the main activities of the organisation and one cannot speak too highly of the work done in this connection, Hot two-course meals are served on three days a week: one day in each of the three areas into which the Borough is divided for this purpose. Some 13,000 such meals were provided: in some cases delivery was made direct to persons in their own homes and in other cases to luncheon clubs. Other activities of the Association include the provision of sea-side holidays - over 150 old people had a week's holiday at Heme Bay; and Social Clubs - 23 Clubs meet each week, providing entertainment, recreation and occupational therapy for nearly 3,000 old people. The majority of these clubs are officially affiliated to the Association and receive financial assistance, stationery, an allocation of places in old people's holiday homes, and a supply of indoor games. Other clubs are not fully affiliated but have representation on the Association's committee. I am very happy to report, in connection with the welfare of aged persons, that the closest possible co-operation exists between the staff of this Department and members of the voluntary Association, the Welfare Department of the London County Council and also with the home nursing, domestic help, and other services provided by that Authority. SECTION 47. Removal to suitable premises of persons in need of care and attention. This Section of the National Assistance Act gives a local authority power to apply to a court of summary jurisdiction for an Order for the removal to and detention in a suitable hospital or other place for a period not exceeding three months persons who (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions, and (b) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. Seven clear days' notice of intention to make such application must be given to the person concerned. Section 1 of the Amendment Act of 1951 simplifies this procedure somewhat by enabling the court or a single justice of the peace to dispense with the seven days' notice required under the earlier Act if it is certified by the Medical Officer of Health and another registered medical practitioner that, in their opinion, it is necessary in the interests of the person for whom the Order for removal is sought to remove him without delay. Such an Order can, however, require the detention of the person for three weeks only, instead of the three months specified in the 1948 Act. The application for an Order may be made by the Medical Officer of Health if the local authority authorise him to make applications in cases to which the amending Act applies. When persons living in the conditions visualised are met with it is usually necessary for speedy action to be taken and the Council has, therefore, given to the Medical Officer of Health and to his Deputy authority to take the necessary action in emergency. The powers referred to affect the liberty of the subject and one is extremely loath to use them; old people cling to their own homes and to the 52 surroundings to which they are accustomed and this is an aspect of the matter which must never be forgotten. Fortunately, of the old people living in unsatisfactory circumstances dealt with it was necessary in only two cases to resort to legal action, and then only after all other means had failed. Some 27 of the more difficult cases were reported to the Public Health Committee, and these persons were dealt with as follows:- Removed to old people's home on Magistrate's Order 1 Removed to hospital on Magistrate's Order 1 Voluntary removal to old people's home 4 Voluntary removal to hospital 21 Total 27 Two cases were dealt with under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act: (i) An elderly man found to be living in indescribably filthy conditions in a basement room. The Magistrate's Order required this person's detention in Part III accommodation for a period of three months. He was subsequently transferred to a hospital, in which he died. (ii) A man needing hospital treatment, who was quite incapable of looking after himself and was living in insanitary conditions. The Order made in respect of this person required his detention in hospital for a period of three months. This Order was carried into effect in November. The man was still in hospital at the end of the year. Throughout the year the staff of the department investigated the cases of 97 persons who were considered to be living in insanitary conditions and in need of care and attention. Every case was fully investigated and involved a total of 399 visits. SECTION 50. (Burial and Cremation). This Section imposes a duty on the Council to cause to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died or been found dead in their area, in any case where it appears to the Authority that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have been or are being made. Burials to the number of 90 were arranged by the Department at a total cost of £532 2s. 0d. Adults 32 Children under 16 years 24 Stillborn children 34 Comparable statistics for the years since the Act came into operation in July, 1948 are:- 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 49 67 81 92 90 The financial position in relation to the burials arranged by the Department in the year under review is:- 53 £ s. d. (1) Full cost recovered in 60 cases: (a) from liable relatives, death grants, and deceased persons' estates (54) 260 12 0 (b) from Hospital Management Committee (6) 23 15 6 (2) Part cost recovered in 20 cases from liable relatives, death grants, deceased persons' estates and other sources 83 8 1 (a) account outstanding (4) 6 7 0 (b) balance irrecoverable - no liable relative (15) 90 2 11 (c) balance "written off" by Public Health Committee (1) 7 19 0 (3) No payment made in 10 cases (a) account outstanding (6) 13 1 0 (b) no liable relative - irrecoverable (3) 34 8 6 (c) "written off" by Public Health Committee (1) 12 8 0 £532 2 0 54 HEALTH EDUCATION The ordinary day-to-day work of the health departments of all local authorities embraces directly or indirectly the matter of health education in its broadest sense. For many years efforts have been made by local authorities and by central government, with varying degrees of success, to bring home to the people of this country the need for a positive approach to health. The Diphtheria immunisation campaign has undoubtedly been the outstanding success in the present century. The almost complete absence of many of the killing diseases of older generations and the gradual but steady progress in the battle against the scourge of Tuberculosis and other dangerous diseases is most encouraging. Complacency, however, is not justified; there is abundant evidence of much subnormal health which cannot be related to definite organic disease, and any measures which help people lead a full, healthy and productive life must be encouraged. Morbidity rates today are far too high, and the chronic subnormal state of health from which so many people suffer is greatly to be deplored. It could be argued that health education, like the comprehensive other education services now so widely available to all sections of the community and at practically all ages, is a matter for the education authorities. It is greatly to be regretted that the National Health Service Act places so much emphasis on the hospital and other curative services, largely to the exclusion of the preventive outlook. There are, however, indications of a change; it is most encouraging to hear that in many medical schools social medicine is now being brought to the notice of medical students with the emphasis it undoubtedly deserves. It must never be forgotten in dealing with human beings that there is, in addition to the physical entity, a mind the influence of which in the protection from disease and the effect on established disease is of incalculable importance. As far as this Department is concerned no opportunity is lost in bringing to the notice of our people matters of importance which make for safe and healthy living. Pamphlets on a large variety of health matters are available for distribution to the public, and a number of talks on health matters was given by members of the staff to various organisations throughout the year. Food hygiene is today one of the matters of great importance to the health and wellbeing of the community at large. For many years the Department has taken a particularly keen interest in this subject, and a comprehensive clean food exhibit is available which portrays the risks of contamination of food and the measures to be taken to obviate these risks. In regard to this matter of clean food I am of opinion that frequent and regular contact with food traders, persons responsible for management of canteens and restaurants, and others, is far more likely to bring about the results we seek than by relying on occasional spectacular campaigns and exhibitions. 55 SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHER AUTHORITIES AND VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS HOSPITALS The North East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board is responsible for the hospital services in this area. The day to day management of hospitals is in the hands of two local Hospital Management Committees: Hackney Group (No 6) Hospital Management Committee comprises the following:- Hackney Hospital (general and chronic sick) - 1,166 beds Eastern Hospital (infectious disease, including tuberculosis and dermatology) - 545 beds German Hospital (general) - 218 beds Mothers' Hospital (Salvation Army) (maternity) 110 beds Hackney Physical Treatment Centre, Dalston Lane. The Group serves, in the main, residents of Hackney and Stoke Newington although many patients come from districts adjacent to the Borough Central Group (No 5) Hospital Management Committee is responsible for the Metropolitan Hospital (general) - 147 beds This is the only hospital of this group situated in the Borough. A centre for the treatment of venereal diseases is provided, as well as a chest clinic This latter clinic and that at the London Chest Hospital, Victoria Park, are the main diagnostic and treatment centres for tuberculosis for Hackney and neighbouring boroughs PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES. Responsibility for the provision of general medical and dental services rests with the London Executive Council. The London County Council provide the following: (a) Ambulance facilities. Ambulance Stations are sited at Homerton Grove and Paragon Road. (b) Maternity and Child Welfare Centres The six maternity and child welfare centres, where ante-natal and post-natal, and infant welfare consultasessions are held are situate at:- 29, Cadogan Terrace, E,9. 28, Elsdale Street, E.9. 28, Lower Clapton Road, E,5. 136, Richmond Road, E 8. 186, Upper Clapton Road, E.5.

Other services provided by the London County Council include health visiting, home nursing, domiciliary midwifery, domestic help, care and aftercare of persons suffering from tuberculosis and a comprehensive school health service. VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS St. Joseph's Hospice in Mare Street is administered by a Catholic community of nuns and provides accommodation for persons suffering from chronic and incurable diseases. The services rendered by the Sisters is of the highest order and meets a great need. The Hackney District Nursing Association, which is affiliated to the Queen's Institute of District Nurses, has an average staff of 25 nurses, and as agents of the Local Health Authority paid over 90,000 visits to general and midwifery cases during the year ended 31st March, 1953. The association also provides a mobile physiotherapy unit and this service is much appreciated by residents, St. John Ambulance Brigade. The Hackney Division is most active and renders valuable service in many directions, more particularly in providing first-aid facilities at many sporting and recreational centres in the area. 7he British Red Cross Society The Hackney Division comprises five detachments and one cadet unit totalling 175 members. Services provided include lectures to members of the National Hospital Service Nursing Reserve, loan of medical supplies and transporting and guiding of patients, Women's Voluntary Services. The local branch of this organisation continued to render invaluable assistance in connection with the hospital library service, the distribution of welfare foods, issue of clothing and furniture to necessitous cases, old people's welfare, children's escorts to and from hospital and convalescent homes, etc. The branch is represented on several local social welfare committees.
