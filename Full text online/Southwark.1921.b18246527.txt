Public Health Department, Town Hall, Walworth Road, S.E. Dear Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting for your consideration my thirtyfifth Annual Report which deals with the vital statistics and general sanitary work for the year 1921. It will be seen that there is a decrease in the birth-rate during the year of 4 per 1,000. The death-rate is slightly lower than that of last year. The infantile mortality rate has very slightly increased owitig to the great length of a hot summer causing more Epidemic Diarrhoea. The deaths from Measles were very few, whilst the deaths from Whooping Cough were nearly the same as those of the previous year. There has been a general increase in the year 1921 of all notifiable infectious diseases on those of the previous year, especially in Scarlet Fever and Diarrhaea. Primary Pneumonia and Influenzal Pneumonia were responsible for a large number of deaths. There has been no diminution in the poverty of our population during the year. Necessitous children and expectant and nursing motherhave received free milk to the extent of £3,000 The greatest cars has been exercised in seeing that the milk is only given to those persons coming within the scale fixed for necessitous mothers and children by the Committee having to do with that matter. The Maternity and Child Welfare work has gone on pretty quietly increasing throughout the year, although two or three changes have to be recorded, one, that All Saints' Voluntary Ceutre, through lack of funds, has been taken over by the Council, and that other Voluntary Centres have been assisted by small subsidies. A Dental Clinic for expectant and nursing mothers and children under five years of age was opened at Lorrimore Hall, Lorrimore Street, on Septemoer 8th, 1921. I am sorry to record the death of our very capable Food and Drugs Inspector, Mr. David, who died on April 18th, 1921. The work of food inspection at the wharves has considerably increased during the year, due to the large amount of unsound food dealt with. The inspector appointed under the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919, is continuing his work. I have to thank the Council for their courtesy and support. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Ilea ith. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, of the Borough of Southwark. 2 SUMMARY OF STATISTICS, 1921.

We have since received an unrevised figure supplied by the Registrar-General of 186,000, the increase in the latter figure would make our death-rates a little better than those shown in the report. There is little to record of the increase in new buildings, as with a few small exceptions the whole of the area of the Borough has been built over. Guinness' Buildings in the Kennington Park Road have now been erected on the site that has remained vacant for some years owing to the war. Further progress has been made also with the various blocks being built on the Tabard Street area. The Grotto Place area still remains in the same state as when represented. There has been much distress during the year among our inhabitants through increased unemployment. Southwark being a district inhabited principally by artisans and casual labourers would naturally feel the effect of this unemployment much more than the wealthier boroughs. It always is to me a matter of surprise how all the families with the breadwinner out of employment manage to exist. It is on account of the strong communal feeling in our people that one seldom sees actual starvation. As I have reported in many previous years, Southwark, owing to its close proximity to the centre, that is, the City, will always be more or less overcrowded in the area occupied by casual workers Enquiry is often made as to the present condition of the houses in the Borongh. I admit that many of the houses from the outside are dirty in appearance, but the interiors are as clean as they were before the war. The high cost of repairs does not allow the owners to expend much money on outside cleansing and painting. What with the income tax and the expenses of maintaining houses in a fair condition, there is little as an income for the owner. 4 The population of the several divisions of the Borough at each Census since 1841, and also the estimated population for 1902, 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906, 1907, 1908, 1909, 1910, 1912, 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918, 1919 and 1920. The population shown for 1921 is an enumerated one, but is unrevised. Newington.

The number of Births registered in the Borough during 1921 was 4,400, of which 2,271 were males, and 2,129 females. This represents a birth-rate of 239 per 1,000 inhabitants The number of births registered in the individual parishes was as follows:—Newington, 2,749; St. George the Martyr, 1,234; Christchurch and St. Saviour's, 417. Of the 4,400 births registered in the Borough 62 were transferred away, the permanent residence of the parents being outside the Borough. 700 births occurring in various lying-in and other institutions outside the Borough, but belonging to Southwark parents, were notified to me by the Registrar-General. When the 62 " outward " transfers are deducted 6 and the 700 "inward" transfers are added to the 4,400 births actually registered in the Borough, the net amount of births belonging to Southwark for the year is found to be 5,038. This gives a corrected birth-rate of 27.3. Birth-rate for the last Thirty Years for the Three Divisions of the Borough as formerly existed. Newington. St. George's St. Saviour's and Christchurch.

These deaths in institutions comprised 255 belonging to Southwark and 497 to other sanitary districts. The number of inhabitants belonging to the Borough dying away from home—that is outside our boundaries in tbe various hospitals and infirmaries—was 1,273. When the 517 deaths of those persons who were non-parishioners, but who died in our Borough, have been deducted, and the 1,273 " outlying " deaths added, the actual or "corrected" number of deaths belonging to the sanitary area is found to be 2,633, of which number 1,419 were males and 1,214 females. The death-rate when calculated on this " corrected'' number is 14-3 per 1,000 inhabitants for the whole Borough for the year 1921, as against a rate of 14-4 for 1920. The percentage of persons dying away from Southwark in relation to the total number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 48'3. The various localities in which the "outlying" deaths occurred are shown in the following table. TABLE 3. Outlying Deaths, with Localities. Males. Females. Total.

This figure does not represent the whole of the cases occurring in the Borough, as notification was discontinued during 1921. I advised the Council to apply to the Ministry of Health to allow Measles in this Borough to be again notifiable. This request has been granted, and the disease again became notifiable on January 1st, 1922. Deaths from Measles during the last ten years:— 1912 139 1917 75 1913 105 1918 145 1914 95 1919 19 1915 131 1920 63 1916 94 1921 6 The annual death-rate per 1,000 living was 0-03. DIARRHEA. During the year under consideration there were 149 deaths from diarrhsea. For the last five years there was a diminution in the number of deaths, ranging from 107 in 1916, to 59 in 1920, but owing to an exceptionally hot and dry summer the disease was very fatal, especially in infants. 108 deaths were recorded of infants under one year of age. In regard to the action taken by the staff, it can be said that every case notified was visited and the premises reported upon. Instructions and leaflets were also given to the parents. The annual death-rate at all ages from Diarrhsea per 1,000 living was 0'81.

One case of this disease was notified during the year in the person of a male, aged 43, a master brushmaker. I made inquiries into this case and found material on the premises for making grass brushes, but no hair. The date of the onset of the disease was December 8th, and the patient was treated at Guy's Hospital on December 10th. The case was bacteriologically confirmed by culture and film, the site of the disease being the forehead. The nature of the medical treatment was excision and injection of Sclavo's serum. The progress of the patient was excellent, and he has now recovered. INFLUENZA. The deaths from this disease were 49 for the year. The annual death rate per 1,000 living was 0-27.

Under our agreement with the London County Council, 2,952 children were cleansed. One cleansing was found to be sufficient in verminous cases, except when the cases were associated with imperigo, when two or three cleansings had to be given. Many of the children treated were suffering from Scabies. In every case the treatment at our Station was thoroughly efficacious, and no recurrence of the trouble was experienced. 175 adults sent from the various common lodging houses and other places in our borough were cleansed during the year, as against 139 dealt with under the provisions of the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, in 1920. 72 TABLE 33.

S.E. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Southwark. Sir and Gentlemen, Daring the year 1921 there have been considerable changes in the administration of Tuberculosis owing to the Insurance Committee having transferred Sanatorium Benefit as carried out under the Insurance Act to the London County Council, so that the duty of providing treatment in Institutions and the supervision of domiciliary cases is now invested in that body. This change has not altered the management and constitution of the dispensary, nor has it lessened the work, though some of it has diverted into other channels, the clerical work having increased and a good deal more outdoor work being entailed in the following up of old cases and the supervision of the homes. In order to cope with this it became necessary either to appoint an additional Medical Officer or an extra nurse to do more home visiting. The latter course was adopted as being a more economical and satisfactory arrangement, and an extra nurse was duly appointed, with very satisfactory results. The home conditions show considerable improvement, though considerable overcrowding is still unavoidable. By the use of the beds lent by the Council we are able to lessen this to some extent where the overcrowding leads to direct infection, and the shelters lent to the patients also tend in this direction, while at the same time enabling patients to live under open-airconditions if their health will permit and their arrangements allow of it. The Staff now consists of the Medical Officer of Health, as Administrative Officer, the Tuberculosis Medical Officer, a Secretary Dispenser, three Nurses and the Caretakers. In connection with the Staff I regret to have to report the illness of Nurse O. M. Wallis, who has in consequence been obliged to give up her post after five years thorough and painstaking work. In accordance with instructions from the Ministry of Health, more work which can appropriately be done by them is being allocated to the panel practitioners, but all cases are kept under the dispensary for periodical supervision. The result is that the number of individual 164 attendances of old cases at the dispensary is fewer and more time can be devoted to the examination of new cases and to those who need special advice and attention. The actual number of cases notified has slightly increased and we are getting more systematic notification from hospitals. The deaths also are slightly in excess, having been increased in number by the complication of influenza and also by bronchitis and other lung complaints induced by fogs which invaded London in December. Schemes are in course of completion for the dental treatment of tuberculous patients and also for X-ray examination of doubtful cases where additional scientific evidence is required to complete the diagnosis. The dental treatment is an important factor in treatment as the digestive power of tubercular patients is always deficient, and decayed teeth are a breeding ground for all microbes and channels of infection in tuberculosis. The most recent extension of the work is the provision of extra nourishment to suitable cases as an adjunct to their successful treatment and recovery. Half of the cost of this will be undertaken by the Ministry of Health up to a specified amount. The bed and chair-bedsteads are in constant use and have proved very useful in separating the infectious cases from the rest of the family and are a great preventive factor. The use of shelters is very limited, and though all are in occupation at present this system in Southwark does not justify any great extension. A patient requires considerable hardihood to occupy one under the conditions which exist in their back premises. It is one thing to sleep in a shelter under the pine trees, but quite a different proposition to sleep in one in a back yard or town garden. The patients who have them are doing their best and trying to put up with their conditions. Excepting as a preventive measure in which it has a great measure of utility, I cannot report that the patients have shown any marked improvement from use of the shelters. Copies of all notified cases are received from the Medical Officer of Health, and on receipt of these a note is sent to the practitioner in charge of each case, asking whether he wishes the Dispensary to take any steps in regard to institutional or other treatment, and periodic reports are furnished by them on the progress of domiciliary cases. A very small number of actually tubercular cases have been found among the contacts but many predisposed and delicate cases have been found and dealt with by means of the Invalid Children's Aid Association, 165 the School medical authorities and others. Incidentally other diseases such as rheumatism, heart disetse and ring worm have been found and appropriately dealt with, so that the examination of contacts has a useful sphere apart from discovery of Tuberculosis. To detect the disease in doubtful cases use is made of the taking of systematic temperatures for several days, the subcutaneous injection of test doses of tuberculin, and in children the use of Von Pirquet's skin reaction to tuberculin. Shortly it is intended to make an arrangement whereby X rays can be applied where it would seem an additional assistance in diagnosis. The sputum of cases in which no report has been obtained is also forwarded for microscopical examination to the Borough bacteriologist. In last year's report I stated that the patients who were sent to training colonies had not turned out very successful, and I regret to have to report the same in 1921; few of them stay their full time, and I cannot record one whose training has led to permanent employment. This result is due to the town dweller taking badly to country life, in some cases to the fact that the men are lacking in will-power to start afresh in life, and in others to their objection to having to commence learning at the beginning, expecting to attain capability in too short a time and without effort. There is still a great want for further accommodation for advanced cases, particularly the non-insured and those whose circumstances or age precluded them from admission into the army, and until the very infectious and dying cases can be accommodated we still are keeping the great source of the spread of the disease in our midst. In conclusion, I must thank my staff for their steady and methodical work, the staff of the Public Health Department for their co-operation, and the bacteriological staff of the Council whose work has largely increased during the last two years; also my appreciation of the way in which the Public Health Committees have done all they could to check the ravages of tuberculosis. I am, Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HORACE WILSON. Tuberculosis Officer. 166 TABLE A.
