STPAN 16 27 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE . MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, FOR THE TEAK 1850. TO THE VESTRY OF SAINT PANCRAS. Gentlemen, I have now the honor to present to you my Fourth Annual Report, being a Report on the sanitary condition of your Parish during the year 1859. The number of deaths registered in Saint Pancras in that year numbered 4276, besides 139 which occurred in the Strand Union "Workhouse of Strand parishioners. This year, as last, I have included in this number all the deaths in the University College and Royal Free Hospitals, and omitted all those who died in the Hospitals of adjoining districts, having recently resided in this Parish. The very slight inaccuracy thus existing is not sufficient to affect any of my calculations on the death-rate, as the two numbers very nearly counterbalance each other.* The death-rate was nearly 22 per thousand, or more accurately 219 to every ten thousand living. This rate is on the assumption that the population of Saint Pancras was 195,000 in the middle of the year 1859. This estimate is probably too low; it is the same as I assumed to be the population in 1858. I have explained in a note to Table A the two methods which may be adopted in calculating the present population; by the one method the population would be 194,888, and by the other 204,187. The actual population probably lies somewhere between the two estimates. It is well, however, in estimating the death-rate, to take the population lower than it is, rather than higher, because in this way we shall not, when the census returns are obtained, find that the mortality of the Parish is higher than our calculations have made it. As compared with ten previous years, the mortality of 1859 is higher than the mean of those years when no allowance is made for the increase of population, being 4415 (including the deaths in the Strand Union) to compare with an average of 4052; but this average must be raised at least 10 per cent. to allow for the increase of population, when it becomes 4456; so that the mortality of last year was a little below the corrected average of the ten years 1849—58, inclusive. The death-rate of the whole Metropolis in 1859 was 2229 per hundred thousand, a little higher than that of St. Pancras. The death-rate in the northern districts of the Metropolis, which include Marylebone, Hampstead, Islington, Hackney, and Pancras, was 2116; so that the mortality has been a little higher in St. Pancras than in the districts by which it is surrounded. *The exact numbers are as follows:—Of the deaths in Univt sity College Hospital 74 were not parishioners of St. Pancras, and of the deaths in the Royal Free Hospital 38 wore not parishioners, so that 112 should be subtracted from the gross total. There were 99 deaths of parishioners of St. Pancras in Hospitals of adjoining districts, distributed as follows: Middlesex Hospital, 37; Bartholomew's, 21; London Fever. 13; Hospital for Sick Children, 13; Small Pox, 8; King's College, 5; and Charing Cross Hospital, 2. This number would have to be added to the gross amount. After these corrections the number of deaths would be 4263, instead of 4276. 2 From these numbers it will be seen that the health of St. Pancras is far from what it might be. Instead of 219 deaths in the ten thousand living, or 46 living to every death, there ought to be, under the best sanitary conditions, not more than 170 deaths to ten thousand living, or 58 living to every death; so that there were nearly 1000 more deaths in 1859 in St. Pancras than would occur if this Parish were as healthy as some towns in the kingdom. There is great need yet of sanitary improvements. The rates of mortality have been very different in different sub-districts of the Parish, as will be seen by reference to the subjoined Table.

To obtain this latter ratio, the mean number of births in three years has been taken. Thus the mean number of births in 1857, 58, and 59 being divided by the mean number of births in 1851, 52, and 53, gives the rate of increase in six years; then by logarithms, the sixth root of this number is obtained, and this raised to the eighth power gives the rate of increase in eight years. This method of calculating the population gives lower numbers than the one usually adopted, which is to calculate that the increase in population since 1851 has been going on at the same rate as it did between 1841 and 1851. On the latter method the population of the whole Parish in 1859 would be 204,187. This estimate is probably too high. † In this column deaths in the Strand Union are excluded. ‡ In this column the deaths which occurred in St. Pancras Workhouse, the University College and Royal Free Hospitals, instead of being placed in the sub-districts in which those Institutions are situated, have been distributed amongst the several sub-districts in the proportion of their population. § This column does not represent the birth-rate quite accurately, because the births which occur in St. Pancras Workhouse, instead of being all of them placed in Camden Town Sub-district, should be distributed amongst the sub-districts, did we know where the women delivered in that Workhouse came from. 3 This Table may be read thus: to every 100 children who died, 131 were born in Regent's Park Sub-district, 146 in Tottenham Court, 158 in Gray's Inn Road, 149 in Somers Town, and so on; and to every 100 who died under five years, 329 were born in Regent's Park, 245 in Tottenham Court, and so on. According to Table A, the sub-districts arranged in their order of mortality would stand thus, beginning with the one whose death-rate was lowest:—Gray's Inn Road, Camden Town, Tottenham Court, Somers Town, Regent's Park, and Kentish Town. It is a remarkable fact that Kentish Town, whose mortality has hitherto been the lowest, appears on this Table to have had the highest death-rate. There is reason to believe that the estimated population is not quite equal to the actual population, and if this be so, that circumstance would unduly raise the death-rate. It is not unlikely, too, that in the distribution of the deaths in the "Workhouse, in the proportion of the population of the several sub-districts, Kentish Town may have got more than its due share. However this may be, there is no doubt about the fact, that whilst in 1859 every other sub-district has had a lower mortality than in 1858, Kentish Town on the other hand has had an increased mortality. In 1858 there were 713 deaths registered in the Kentish Town Sub-district, and in 1859 there were 825, whilst in 1857 there were only 609. There was an increase in that sub-district in the number of deaths from Small Pox, from 3 in 1858 to 19 in 1859; from Measles, from 14 to 39; from Scarlatina and Diphtheria, from 53 to 89; from Diarrhoea, from 20 to 56; and from Low Fever, from 26 to 29. Looking at Table E, it will be seen that in the ratio of deaths to births, Gray's Inn District stands lowest, Somers Town next, Camden Town and Kentish Town come next, Regent's Park next, and Tottenham Court District stands highest. The mortality of Kentish Town appears to be undergoing an annual increase, out of proportion to the increase of its population, which is increasing at a very rapid rate. It is my duty to endeavour to discover the causes of this increase. Kentish Town has natural advantages over the other districts of the Parish, in being on a higher level, and very much on an inclined plane; it has also the advantage of being less densely populated. To what then is to be ascribed its increasing mortality ? Probably to a combination of causes. In the first place must be mentioned the circumstances that the population is becoming more dense, and that many of the new residents are newly married people, with young and increasing families, so that there will be a large proportion of infants, whose mortality is always high. In the next place there are several open sewers, which are constantly becoming more and more offensive and noxious, especially the old Fleet and its tributaries in the Gospel Oak Fields, which ought long ago to have been covered in. Another very important cause of insalubrity is to be found in a large number of open undrained spaces, which become the receptacles for all kinds of vegetable and animal refuse, and are constantly studded with pools of stagnant and evaporating water; these places give rise to malarious emanations, which exercise a very depressing and injurious influence on the health of those who live near them. Another equally important cause is to be found in the character of many of the newly built dwelling-houses in this 6ub-district. The houses are built on a heavy clay soil, into which water sinks with great difficulty, frequently the dwelling-rooms are down close upon this soil, without any or with but little excavation, and with no compost or other impervious material to prevent the constant evaporation and escape of emanations from the soil, so that the lower rooms are generally damp, and the whole houses rendered unhealthy. The walls are not generally of sufficient thickness to exclude cold, and it is very often the case that the houses are occupied long before the walls have had time to dry. In some instances the drains, although they are believed to lead from each 4 house directly into the sewer in front, are combined with the drains from adjoining houses, and the combined drainage enters the sewer by one drain under one of the set of houses. From a variety of causes this common drain is liable to get obstructed, and in consequence a number of houses suffer from choked drains instead of one. In some cases the water for brick-making has been taken from the open sewers in the neighbourhood of Gospel Oak Fields, and being saturated with decomposing organic matter, will probably for a long time give rise to noxious emanations in the houses built with these bricks. In many houses the receptacle for water is placed in objectionable proximity to the dustbin and water closet, and is uncovered, so that it gets contaminated with the gases from these places. Very often there is only one tank to supply water to the house and to the water closet, and no precautions are taken to prevent the escape of effluvia from the closet into the water tank. It will be seen that some of these causes, especially the open sewers, may be removed by you, and that the recurrence of others may be prevented by increased vigilance in future on the part of your officers, whilst others can only be obviated by the public being alive to these matters, and taking care to protect themselves. By reference to Table 0, it will be observed that the mortality in some streets and places is twice as high as in others. In this Table I have taken a number of places as specimens from different parts of the Parish, and calculated the annual death-rate during four years. Amongst places with high mortality may be noted Henry Street, Mary Street, and Mary Place, Hampstead Eoad; Drapers Place, Holbrook Court & Place, Midford Place, New Inn Yard, and Little George Street, Hampstead Eoad; Hampton Court, Somers Town; Chad's Place, James Street, Wellington Square, Cooper's Buildings, Melina Place, near Cromer Street, Poplar Place, and Wilson Place. All of those places have had an average annual mortality over 30 in the thousand. They are most of them densely populated by the poor and dirty, and abound with children. There is a very great difficulty in London for poor people with large families to get lodgings in any place which is not already thronged with children; so that some streets and courts literally swarm with children, whilst adjoining streets have scarcely any. These crowded streets are the constant hotbeds of disease of various kinds, which, from close proximity and want of pure air, is transmitted from one to another, and propagated de novo. Very little has been done in this Parish to abate overcrowding, and distribute people more evenly through the Parish; extreme cases of overcrowding brought under my notice have been proceeded against; ten such cases have occurred during the year 1859; but no systematic efforts have been made in this direction. In some districts of the Metropolis, it has been made a rule not to allow any room to be so crowded as not to give 300 cubic feet of space for each occupant, or 400 for each adult, and 250 for each child There are difficulties in carrying out such a rule, especially in cases of great poverty, but some such standard, followed with discrimination, is really required; and this cannot be considered too high, being much lower than one would like to see, but probably as high as can be expected, on account of pecuniary considerations. It is about the standard employed by the Inspectors of the Registered Common Lodging Houses, and the rooms in these houses, it must be remembered, are only occupied at night, and are not used for cooking, washing, and other domestic purposes. 5 [ Tame C. ] A Table showing the mortality of, and some other particulars relating to certain Streets and Places selected as specimens from each Sub-District.

In 1859. St. Pancras. London. 723 Pulmonary Affections (including Phthisis) 587 611 276 Phthisis 281 276 94 Measles 54 47 208 Scarlatina 142 151 93 Hooping Cough 70 63 65 Alvine Flux (including Dysentery, Diarrhœa, and Cholera) 116 134 56 Typhus Fever 66 65 125 Nervous Diseases of Infancy 112 143 2312 From all causes 2179 2292 From this Table it appears that, as compared with 1858, Pulmonary Affections, except Phthisis, were much less fatal; Measles, Scarlatina, Hooping Cough, and the nervous diseases of infancy were also less fatal; whilst in the mortality from Diarrhoea, Dysentery, and Cholera classed together, there was a considerable increase, and from Typhus Fever there was a small increase. Small Pox occasioned 37 deaths in 1859, and only 22 in 1858. Beside these there have been eight deaths from that disease in St. Pancras parishioners at the Small Pox Hospital I was unable to obtain any return of these deaths from the Resident Medical Officer at that Hospital, who declined to let me consult their Register of Deaths; but I have obtained them through the courtesy of Dr. Ballards, Medical Officer of Health, from his weekly returns for Islington. The deaths from Small Pox have been distributed amongst the sub-districts as follows:—Regent's Park, 11; Tottenham Court, 2, and 1 in Hospital; Gray's Inn Road, 2, and 3 in Hospital; Camden Town, 3; Kentish Town, 19, and 4 in Hospital; Somers Town, 0. Of the whole number, 29 were either not vaccinated at all, or else vaccinated after they had been exposed to the infection of Small Pox, and whilst the disease was brooding in their system; only 3 are said to have been vaccinated at an early enough period to afford them protection, and there is no evidence in any of them that the vaccination was of a satisfactory kind; in 5 cases no information as to vaccination could be obtained, so that the probability is that these were also unvaccinated These facts speak for themselves, showing as they do, in combination with innumerable others of the same kind, the great protective power of vaccination. The number of cases sent to the Small Pox Hospital by the Directors of the Poor of this Parish during the year 1859 was 76. Owing to the prevalence of Small Pox during the last twelve months, increased exertions have been made with the view of getting the practice of vaccination more generally attended to. Handbills and large notices have been extensively distributed through the Parish, calling the attention of the Public to the prevalence of Small Pox, and the neglect of vaccination, and urging on them the importance of getting themselves and their children vaccinated, reminding them at the same time of the penalty to which they become liable by neglect. Wherever Small Pox has been known to prevail, house to house visitations have been made by myself, one of the Public Vaccinators, or the Inspectors, to ascertain that vaccination and re-vaccination are not neglected, and other precautions observed to prevent the spread of the disease. The Registrars' Books have been consulted, and extracts made, at the expense of the Directors of the Poor, of the addresses of all children born between Michaelmas, 1858, and Michaelmas, 1859, whose vaccination had not been certified. Then these places have been visited to discover how it was that the children's vaccination was not certified. In some cases the children had 8 removed to other districts; in some they had died; in many instances vaccination had been performed by private medical men, who had failed to send the vaccination certificate to the Registrars; in some few the operation had been postponed, on account of the ill health of the child; and in a certain proportion of cases, about 10 per cent. of the whole, the vaccination had been neglected. In this last set of cases notices were served on the parents, requiring them to get the operation at once performed. These notices have been in nearly every case successful. The number of houses thus visited was about 4000. Another thing was done, which was probably of more use than all the others. All the Public Schools in the Parish were visited by myself, accompanied in most cases by one or other of the Public Vaccinators. All the children in attendance at these Schools were carefully examined to discover how many of them were well vaccinated, or had previously had Small Pox, how many had not been vaccinated at all, and how many had but imperfect marks of vaccination. This examination was, as may be supposed, attended with no small amount of labour, but it was productive of great benefit in directing the attention of the managers of Schools, as well as parents and guardians, to the subject of vaccination, and in getting a very large number of children, who were either quite unprotected, or but imperfectly protected from the risk of taking Small Pox, well vaccinated. The results of the examination are given in detail in the annexed Table. It there appears that between nine and ten thousand children were examined, and between 5 and 6 per cent. of these exhibited no marks of vaccination, whilst between 14 and 15 per cent. more, exhibited but indistinct and unsatisfactory scars from the operation. In nearly all the former cases the children were vaccinated, and in a great many of the latter set of cases they were re-vaccinated. The number of children marked with Small Pox was not very great, except in one or two Schools in neighbourhoods where the diseaso had been recently epidemic; this was especially the case in one or two Eagged Schools near Ferdinand Street, Pancras Yale, and near Cromer Street, Gray's Inn Road. The neglect of vaccination varied much in different Schools, but in not one School was it found that all the children were already vaccinated. It was generally observed, that of the children who had been vaccinated in the country a larger proportion was not well vaccinated than of those vaccinated in London. In order to induce the managers of Public Schools to direct their attention to the vaccination of their Scholars, the following circular has recently been printed by the Sanitary Committee on my recommendation, and sent to each of the Public Schools in the Parish. Sufficient time has not yet elapsed to allow of replies to the circular being received. "Saint Pancras, Middlesex. Sanitary Department, Office, 10, Edward Street, Hampstead Road, N.W. May 26th, 1860. To the Committee of Schools. Gentlemen, You are aware that some weeks since, I paid a visit to the Schools of this Parish, with the view of ascertaining how far the children attending them were protected by vaccination, or a previous attack of Small Po.x, from the risk of taking that disease. I did not find, out of 80 Schools which I visited, one in which all the children 9 were protected, but a proportion of from 10 to 20 per cent. of the whole number not at all protected, whilst many others, who had been vaccinated, presented such imperfect scars, that there was reason to believe the protection was much less complete than it might be. In some Schools it had been laid down as a rule, that all children should be vaccinated previously to admission; but even in these, the rule had been almost ignored, or at any rate no system had been adopted to ensure its being attended to. The importance of vaccination is now almost universally admitted, and its value has been incontestably established on the most incontrovertible data. There is no doubt that epidemics of Small Pox break out owing to the neglect of parents to have their children vaccinated, especially at times when the disease is not prevailing. I have been desired by the Sanitary Authorities in this Parish to urge on you the importance of making a continuous effort in future to get all the children who come to your School well vaccinated. With this object it is very desirable that all persons bringing their children for admission to your School should be informed that the Managers of the School consider it necessary, in order to keep Small Pox from the children, that they should all have been vaccinated, and that they expect all parents to produce evidence that this operation has been successfully performed on their children, either by producing the original vaccination certificate, or some other medical certificate; or where this cannot be readily effected, that they should be examined by one of the Public Vaccinators, or myself, at the earliest possible opportunity. Should you accede to this suggestion, I shall be happy on hearing from you, to make an arrangement by which this examination can be carried out periodically as occasion requires. Unless something can be done to ensure a more thorough vaccination of the public, the Legislature will no doubt, ere long, render the Compulsory Vaccination Act more stringent, and people will be obliged, under penalties, to submit to what a regard for public health demands, but which ought to be carried out if possible by moral suasion, rather than by penal enactments. I remain, Gentlemen, Tour obedient Servant, Thomas Hillier, H.D., Medical Officer of Health." If it is assumed that the proportion of all children under 15 years of age, living in the Parish, who are unprotected by vaccination, is the same as the proportion found in the Public Schools, it would appear that there were in the Parish about 2800 children under 15 years not vaccinated at all, besides many children under 3 months of age, and between 8 and 9 thousand children but imperfectly vaccinated. The number of children living in the Parish under 15 years of age may be taken at about 56,000. 10 Results of Inspections of Public Schools in Saint Pancras, in reference to Vaccination in 1859.

Diphtheria gave 47 deaths in 1858, and 51 in 1859; Measles in l858, 184, in 1859, 105 deaths; Hooping Cough in 1858, 182, in 1859, 145; Typhus, 115 in 1858, and 129 in 1859; Diarrhoea, 115 in 1858, and 222 in 1859; Dysentery, 7 in 1858, and 11 in 1859; Cholera, 5 in 1858, and 4 in 1859. If the mortality of the different quarters of the year be compared with that of the corresponding quarters of 1858 and previous years, it will be found that the winter quarter was more healthy than the same quarter of 1858, but less healthy than the average; that the spring quarter was a little less healthy than the average; that the summer quarter was considerably more unhealthy than the preceding years, and than the average of corresponding quarters in ten previous years; whilst the fourth or autumn quarter was unusually healthy. Small Pox was fatal to a certain number in each quarter, to the largest number in the fourth; Measles was fatal to a certain number in each quarter, *Many marked with the Small Pox. 12 but to the argest number in tbe first; Scarlatina was fatal to the largest numbers in the first and fourth quarters; Diphtheria was most fatal in the third, first, and second quarters; Hooping Cough in the first and second quarters; Diarrhoea by far the most fatal in the third quarter; whilst Low Fever was almost equally fatal in the first, third, and fourth quarters, and somewhat less so in the second. SANITARY WORKS. I am glad to be able to congratulate the Parish on the paving of Gray's Inn Road, and the formation of good macadamized roads in a number of streets lying between Gray's Inn Road and Bagnigge "Wells Road, in the St. Jude's Ecclesiastical District. This portion of the Parish having belonged to no Paving Board under the old regime had never been taken to by your Vestry until lately, so that the roads there were in a very bad state, and certainly injurious to health from their stagnant pools and the accumulations of animal and vegetable refuse upon them. Some new roads have also been made in Agar Town, another very much neglected part of the Parish. I am sorry that I cannot report to the same effect respecting new sewerage in the Parish. The only new sewers that have been made are pipes in Winchester Terrace, Agar Town, in Midford Place, Tottenham Court Road, and York Buildings, Church Way. There are still many places in the Parish where new sewers are required. The open sewerage in the Gospel Oak Pields and other parts of Kentish Town urgently requires to be covered in with proper sewers. The following improvements have been effected, under the inspection of myself or the Sanitary Inspectors:— 185 houses have been supplied with new drains. 656 new traps have been put on drains. 198 houses have had their drainage repaired and improved. 270 cesspools have been cleared out and abolished. 286 closets have been supplied with new pans, traps, and water supply. 29 new water closets have been erected. 57 new dust-bins have been erected. 68 dust-bins have been repaired. 127 yards and cellars have been fresh paved. 21 houses have been supplied with water. 105 houses have been cleansed and limewhited. 46 houses have had their ventilation improved. 2 houses unfit for habitation have been shut up. In 10 houses overcrowding has been abated. 37 lots of pigs have been removed. 24 cow-sheds have been improved. 161 other nuisances of various kinds have been abated. In carrying out these improvements there have been served 545 preliminary notices, and 123 final notices. In 138 cases it has been necessary to take the cases before the Magistrates by means of summonses. Six butchers have been summoned and fined for killing in places not licensed for slaughtering. The number of complaints entered on the books has been 786. The time of the Inspectors has been also engaged in abating a moral nuisance, though not perhaps strictly a sanitary nuisance, I mean the Sunday trading in Somers Town. Forty summonses have been issued under the old Paving Acts, for the removal of obstructions caused by these Sunday traders, and have been successful in their object so far as the stalls in the streets are concerned. Syphilis gave 38 deaths in 1859, whilst it only gave 19 in 1858. This does not speak well for the public morality. 13 Childbirth was fatal in 31 instances. Premature birth in 60 instances. Stillborn children are not registered. 19 children died from congenital malformations. 183 persons died from old age, of whom 2 were above 95, and 10 between 90 and 95 years of age. The ages at death are deserving of notice. Under the age of 1 year there were 972, nearly 23 per cent. of the entire number of deaths. Under the age of 5 years there were 1817 deaths, nearly 43 per cent. of the whole mortality. During the second five years of life the deaths numbered only 199, being nearly 5 per cent. of the deaths at all ages. During the third five years, that is between 10 and 15 years of age, the deaths numbered only 82, which is less than 2 per cent. of all deaths; in the next 10 years of life, 189 deaths; between 25 and 35 years of age, 285; and for the several consecutive periods of 10 years up to the age of 85, the numbers of deaths were as follows: 323, 342, 393, 353, and 239. Above the age of 85 there were only 46 deaths, 3 of these being over 95. Amongst the causes of death, those which may be classed together as violent deaths are worthy of notice. There were 23 suicides; one by means of a pistol, 6 by cutting their throats, 2 by poison, 3 by drowning, 7 by hanging, and 4 by other methods, of which 2 were by jumping from a window. The violent deaths from accident or negligence numbered 95; of these, 89 were from fractures and contusions, 4 being received on the railway, 3 from scaffold accidents, and 10 on the road by falls, from being run over by horses or some vehicle. There were 28 deaths from burns and scalds, of which 16 were children under 15 years of age. There were 4 young children scalded to death, and one killed by drinking hot water from the spout of a kettle. All the burns were by the catching on fire of clothes, not by a general conflagration. They are very frequently due to children being left alone in rooms were there is a fire without any screen. Two deaths were from poison taken accidentally, one opium, and the other iodine. Four persons were accidentally drowned. There were 15 deaths ascribed to suffocation; of these, 12 were in children under one year old, and one between one and two years of age. Some of these are due to the mother going to bed in a state of intoxication and overlying the infant; others are due to too many persons sleeping in one bed; others to carelessness and over sound sleep on the part of the mother or nurse; and others are probably intentional. There were 9 newly-born infants murdered, and 3 cases of manslaughter, 2 of children 3 years old, and one of a man aged 42. Twenty-two children are registered as dying from want of breast milk; many of the deaths ascribed to convulsions, atrophy, debility, and other causes, are in part due to the same cause, taken in conjunction with the improper food which is administered to children deprived of their natural sustenance. Ten deaths were from delirium tremens, induced by intoxicating drinks; nine directly from intemperance. Many of the accidental deaths, probably onehalf, were due to intoxication. Many of the cases of apoplexy, of diseases of the liver and kidneys, might be traced to an excessive use of alcoholic drinks. It is to be hoped that the establishment of public drinking fountains in the Parish will tend to diminish the amount of intemperance, and that the introduction of light foreign wines at a lower price may ultimately have the effect of giving a taste for milder drinks than such as have formerly been preferred. At present there are six drinking fountains erected in the following localities: in the Camden Broadway; near the "Workhouse; at the top of Cromer Street; in the Pancras Yale, near Adelaide Terrace; in Brewer Street, Somers Town; and near Highgate Hill. Arrangements are made for the erection of five others on the following sites:—the north end of Mornington Crescent, Albert Road, Regent's Park, Euston Square, Cumberland Market, and Junction Place, 14 Kentish Town. Care is taken that the water supplied by these fountains shall be well filtered, and as cool as can be managed. It will not be likely therefore in hot weather to cause diarrhoea or cholera, as the water from many of the old street pumps has been known to do. The fountains already in operation are much frequented, and in some localities much valued. I believe, that after a time, they will be much more resorted to, and I hope that there will, ere long, be a number more of them erected. The slaughter-houses have been visited periodically as in previous years. There has been a great deal of unwholesome food, which had been exposed for sale, seized by the Inspectors, and condemned by the Magistrates. During the summer, which was very hot and much calculated to produce tainting of animal food, there was an unusual quantity of unsound meat, poultry, and fish offered for sale. There have been 46 parcels of bad fish seized, 8 lots of poultry, 6 of bacon, 9 lots of meat, about 1200 rabbits, 240 pine apples, and 6 parcels of oranges. Besides the things actually seized, there is no doubt that, owing to the vigilance of the Inspectors, many unsound and unwholesome things, which would otherwise have been offered for sale, and probably sold on account of its low price, have been kept back or taken to other districts. It might perhaps be supposed that people could protect themselves from such things as these, but experience proves the contrary; and it is astonishing what decayed food will be bought by the poor, if they are allowed to do so. I have again this year, as last, tabulated the mortality which has occurred in the Mews of the Parish. See Table VIII. at the end. The deaths numbered 61, of which 21 were in Tottenham District, 17 in Regent's Park, 8 in Gray's Inn, 10 in Somers Town, and 5 in Kentish Town. Of the whole number, 25 were from Zymotic diseases, viz., 3 from Small Pox, 5 from Measles, 3 from Scarlet Fever, 5 from Hooping Cough, 2 from Diarrhoea, 4 from Low Fever, and 3 from other Zymotic diseases. There were 14 deaths from diseases of the organs of respiration, including Phthisis, and 8 from nervous diseases of infants. Of the whole number who died, 37 were children under 5 years of age. The population residing in Mews is probably between 1500 and 1700, so that the death-rate last year was very high, much higher than in the rest of the Parish, about 36 or 40 per thousand. Something has been done to render the dwelling-rooms over stables more healthy; the paving, drainage, and water supply have been attended to, and the ventilation of many of them has been improved. There is still, however, great need of further improvement in them. There is in nearly all a free communication between the stable and the dwelling, and the dwelling is generally the place into which all the effluvia from the stable escapes. There is very great cause for complaint in the way in which the manure is allowed to remain in the mews yard. There is no regularity observed in carting away the manure; it is removed at all hours of the day, and is allowed to accumulate until there is a convenient opportunity of sending it away; so that at times when farmers are busy in the country, and there are few carts come to London, the dung is left to accumulate in great quantities, and when it is removed is almost rotten and very offensive. This is the case generally at hay-making time, and very frequently in fine weather, after wet, when the dung becomes most offensive. It would be well if every one keeping cattle in Town was obliged, under a penalty, to remove the dung at certain periods, and before eight o'clock in the morning, and if there were contractors appointed to cart this away, being obliged to visit every mews so many times a week. By the 202nd section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, it is provided that the Metropolitan Board of Works may make bye-laws for all works of cleansing and of removing and disposing of refuse, and may impose such 15 reasonable penalties as they think fit, not exceeding forty shillings, for each breach of such bye-laws. Would it not be quite within the meaning of this proviso that they should legislate for the cleansing of mews, and the removal of dung from them? If so, I certainly think they should be urged to make such bye-laws. WORKHOUSE. The number of deaths in this building has been 376, last year it was 438, and in 1857 it was 347. There were 8 deaths from Measles, instead of 39 in 1858, 3 from Scarlatina, 2 from Diphtheria, 9 from Hooping Cough, 4 from Diarrhoea, and none from Low Fever. The number of births was 196, of which 27 were stillborn children, and do not appear on the Register. The deaths under the age of 5 years numbered 53. The number of cases under the care of the District Surgeons is given in Table VII.; and compared with the same number in 1858, it will be seen that the total number of cases was a little lower, that there were fewer cases of Measles, Scarlet Fever, Hooping Cough, and more cases of Small Pox, Diarrhoea, and Low Fever. Nearly half of the cases of Small Pox occurred in the North District, and more than one-third of the cases of Measles, and a quarter of the Diarrhoea, in the same District. METEOROLOGY. The average temperature of the year 1859 was 50.8, which is 2°.3 above the average of 88 years, and l°.6 above that of 18 previous years. The first or winter quarter was much milder than usual, being 40.9 above the average of 88 years. The second or spring quarter was also warmer than usual, being 1°.6 above the average. The third or summer quarter was also hotter than usual, being 3°.3 above the average. The fourth or autumn quarter was a little colder than usual, being half a degree below the average of 88, and 1°.3 below the average of 18 years. The mean daily range of temperature was 160.6, being 0o-9 more than the average of 18 years. The humidity of the air was 80°, being 2 degrees less than the average. The mean height of the barometer was 29.772, a small fraction lower than usual. Rain fell to the amount of 25.9 inches, which was six-tenths of an inch more than the average. The number of nights on which the thermometer fell below 30° was 96, and on which it was between 30 and 40 degrees was 88. The whole of the above items are from the records kept at Greenwich. As compared with 1858, the year was much warmer, especially the winter and summer quarters; there was a lower daily range of temperature, so that extreme sudden transitions from heat to cold and cold to heat were less frequent. The mildness of the winter explains the great reduction in the number of deaths from Bronchitis and Pneumonia. The heat of the summer will probably account for the increased fatality of Diarrhoea; and to the extreme heat of the same must be ascribed three deaths registered as from coup de soleil or sunstroke, which does not often appear on our Registers as a cause of death. During the two preceding years, 1857 and 1858, there had been a great deficiency of rain below the average, whilst in 1859 there was a small excess; and in the second quarter of 1860 there appears to be a still greater excess. I have the honor to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, THOMAS HILLIER. 21, Upper Gower Street, June 26th, 1860. [Table I.] Shewing the causes of Death at different Ages during the year 1859.
