ACT 45 Borough of Acton ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health together with the Report on the Medical Inspection of Schools FOR THE YEAR 1942 ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1942. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Acton, W3. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Acton. Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to submit the annual report on the health of the Borough (or the year 1942. The annual report of the School Medical Service is given at the end as a separate report. There have been changes in the staff of the Public Health Department. Mr. Pratt, the Chief Clerk volunteered for war service and was granted a commission in the R.A.F. on the administrative staff. Miss Hester joined the Women's Land Army and is now engaged in agricultural pursuits. Owing to the increase in the number of patients availing themselves of the ante-natal clinic, the Maternity and Child Welfare Committee authorised the appointment of an extra Health Visitor to assist chiefly with the duties in connection with this clinic. In December 1942, a circular from the Ministry of Health recommended Local Authorities to introduce a Home Help scheme. As this scheme is being formulated, further details will be given in the Annual Report for 1943. It is of interest to note that the birth rate for 1942 was 16.7 as compared with 12.5 in 1941. The infantile mortality rate for 1942 was 71.2 per 1,000 live births, a regrettably high rate as compared with 47.8 per 1,000 live births in 1941. This higher rate is due to the fact that there were 22 deaths in children of under one year as compared with 3 in 1941. Unfortunately, on investigation no evidence came to light as to the cause. Amongst the enquiries carried out were the sanitary arrangements of the houses, but the conditions were found to be satisfactory. 4 STAFF. George E. B.

General Provision of Health Services in the Area. Laboratory Facilities. For the last three months of the year, by arrangement with the Ministry of Health, all materials tequiring bacteriological examination have been sent to the Emergency Medical Service Laboratory, Churchfield Road, Ealing. Ambulance Facilities. Since the 1st April, 1942, the Borough Council has been responsible for maintaining the Ambulance Service previously administered by the Acton Fire Brigade. Civil Defence personnel are responsible for manning the ambulances. The Acton & Wembrey Joint Hospital Board still maintain: an ambulance for removal of infectious cases. Nursing in the Home. The same facilities exist as in previous years, the number of sick persons under care was 379 necessitating 13,620 visits. Hospital Provision. The Acton Borough Council together with the Wembley Bbrough Council maintain a Joint Hospital for treatment of Infectious Disease cases. The Acton Voluntary Hospital treats both surgical and medical cases, as does the Central Middlesex County Hospital which is maintained by the Middlesex County Council. 7 MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE. The Maternity and Child Welfare Services are still being maintained, and the ante-natal clinic has become very busy and overworked, due to the fact that expectant mothers are making much greater use of the clinic, and that the majority of women are relying on the midwifery services, or for hospital treatment for their confinement . The number of births which occurred in hospital were 495, in Nursing Homes 62, attended by midwives 286 and very few by private practitioners. The number of ante-natal clinics held is two sessions weekly, and it appears that early in the New Year it will be necessary to hold three sessions, part-time help having to be obtained if this additional clinic is approved by the Council. The Child Welfare Clinics have been held regularly throughout the year at four different centres, in two instances the clinics are held twice a week. The Table on page 9 shows the attendances at the Welfare Clinics. Expectant and nursing mothers, and children under five years of age, are able to obtain milk, either fresh or dried, together with fruit juices, from the Food Executive Officer, on completing the appropriate application form. Midwifery Service. Expectant mothers can obtain the services of a midwife, if they wish to have their confinement at home, from the Domiciliary Midwifery Service, organised by Queen Charlotte's Hospital. During the year 1942 the Welfare Centres sold 16,269 lbs. of proprietary dried food, and issued free a very few lbs. The general public appear to take in a hesitating manner to the National Dried Milk, which, I understand, is made by various firms who in the _ past made proprietary brands of dried milk. The Food Executive Officer for the Borough has supplied me with the following figures:— Fruit juices and Cod Liver Oil supplied to Expectant Mothers 134 Fruit juices and Cod Liver Oil supplied to children 2,545 Cod Liver Oil only to children 1,043 Dried Milk to children 358 8 Liquid Milk to children— (a) Free 650 (b) Cheap rate 3,020 Liquid Milk to Expectant Mothers— (a) Free 29 (b) Cheap rate 329 Maternal Mortality. Two maternal deaths occurred among Acton mothers during the year. One was due to Pulmonary Embolism due to thrombosis of the common iliac arteries following pregnancy, a rare but fatal condition liable to occur in surgical practice, the exact cause of which is not clear. Various suggestions have been put forward to be used as a precautionary measure to prevent this happening. This death occurred in a hospital outside the Borough, and one in which all the common forms of treatment are used. The other death was due to septicaemia, following a procured abortion—in a young woman. She was admitted for treatment in a grave state, to a hospital outside the Borough. This case was investigated by the Coroner, whose conclusions were as reported above. War-time Day Nurseries. The Committee decided in 1941 to proceed with plans for opening three other Nurseries—one in the Priory in Winchester Street, one in Friars Place Lane, and the other at the comer of Newton Grove and Bedford Road, in a house named "Longcot." That in Friars Place Lane was opened 4th August, 1942 and can accommodate 45 children. "Longcot" was opened on 15th October, 1942 and provides accommodation for 44 children. The Committee reconsidered the scheme of using the Priory Club, and decided not to continue with this plan, but sought the approval of the Ministry of Health to use a house called "The Maples," situated in Uxbridge Road and another house adjacent to "The Maples" in Birkbeck Road. This scheme, approved by the Committee and the Ministry of Health, appeared somewhat clumsy, but practical working of the Nursery will verify this. The Birkbeck Road house is to be used for babies, and "The Maples" for toddlers. The last named Nursery was to be opened early in 1943. Horn Lane Nursery is to be extended to accommodate 60 children. Through the kindness of many Acton residents, the amenities of the Day Nurseries have been increased by gifts of toys, etc., and the loan of two refrigerators. 9 The attendances at Bollo Bridge Road Nursery were 6,810 during the year, and the Matron reports very favourably on the health of the children in the Nursery during the year. Matron of the War-time Nursery in Friars Place Lane reports that since August 6th there have been 3,150 attendances, but that during November and December there was an epidemic of Chicken Pox. Matron of "Longcot" reports that since the opening of the Nursery on 5th October the attendances were 1,449. Matron of Horn Lane Nursery reports that the average monthly number of children on the register was 43, and that the attendances from 1st April to 31st December were 7,053. Many children were absent owing to Measles and Mumps. TABLE 1. INFANT WELFARE CENTRES, 1942.

During the year under review the total number of notifications received was 607 as compared with 505 received in 1941. Measles and Whooping Cough. Measles, have been very prevalent this year—430 cases being notified as compared with 234 in 1941. The attacks have, in some cases, been of a serious and complicated character—120 children from Acton being admitted to the Isolation Hospital, and it was found necessary for several children to be admitted to Isolation Hospitals of neighbouring authorities. One child died as a result of Measles, and in this case accommodation for the child had to be obtained in one of the London County Council's Hospitals. During 1941 there were 107 notifications of Whooping Cough but in 1942 there were 63 and no child died from this disease. To the parents of all children under 5 years it is the practice to offer immunisation against Whooping Cough by means of a vaccine at the time the child is immunised against Diphtheria. During 1940, the number of children under five who were inoculated against Whooping Cough was 36. During 1941 a total of 370 under fives were inoculated. Of the 107 notifications of Whooping Cough only 7 had been inoculated. During 1942, the total of 589 under fives were inoculated and of the 63 cases notified only 2 had been inoculated. Pneumonia. During the year 35 notifications were received of persons suffering from Pneumonia. Puerperal Pyrexia. Four cases occurred in the Borough, all of whom, it is pleasing to relate, recovered from the disease. 11 Other Diseases. Eight persons were notified as suffering from Meningitis, six of whom were treated in the Isolation Hospital, two being treated at home. In the table showing the causes of death it will be seen that two persons died from-Cerebro-spinal Meningitis. Both these cases occurred in Acton residents temporarily living outside the Borough at the time of the illness, and the notification of their illness sent to the Medic'al Officer of Health of the area in which they were temporarily residing. During the year eight cases of diphtheria were admitted to the Isolation Hospital, although in all some twenty-four cases were admitted but were later found not to be suffering from diphtheria. There were two deaths from diphtheria—both boys between five and fifteen years of age. Neither had been immunised although the parents had been repeatedly advised to avail themselves of prophylactic treatment. During the year every endeavour has been made to immunise as many children as possible, with the result that 1,063 were inoculated, (783 were under, and 280 over five years). 166 reinoculations were carried out and 56 were found to be Schick negative after three years. As requested by the Health Committee, the report on the present position as regards diphtheria immunisation is included in the Report below. REPORT ON DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION. 1932-1942. Diphtheria immunisation was introduced in Acton by my predecessor, Dr. Thomas, in 1932. During 1932 and 1933 a diphtheria epidemic occurred in which there were 312 notified cases with 44 deaths. During each succeeding year immunisation has been carried out and the number of cases of diphtheria during that period has been 312 with 29 deaths. In the Annual Report of the M.O.H. for 1933 will be found details of the work carried out, which are embodied in this report. Propaganda. All the births in the Borough are notified to the Public Health Department, and as soon as a child is six months old a letter is sent to the parents giving information as to the benefits of immunisation against Diphtheria, together with place and time where this can be carried out. When the consent is obtained an appointment is made as soon as possible. In the course of daily visits both to homes and schools the Health Visitors advise parents of the need of immunisation. School teachers have also been requested to co-operate in this field and have been of great service. 12 Every third year after immunisation and also on entry into school life, parents are asked to present their children for Schick testing or for re-immunisation. Technique. In the early days of immunisation each child was Schick tested to ascertain whether the child was susceptible, to Diphtheria, if so inoculation was carried out. Following practical experience it has been decided to dispense with Schick testing, except in children above seven years of age. The immunising agent used varied considerably; in 193'2 T.A.M. (Toxoid Antitoxin Mixture), T.A.F. (Toxoid Antitoxin Floccules) or Formol Toxoid were used. In 1936 A.P.T. (Alum Precipitated Toxoid) was used, two doses being given at monthly intervals. Since 1938, however, three doses at monthly intervals of .2c.c., .5c.c., and .5c.c. of A.P.T. are given. At the end of every three years the child is re-inoculated using .5c.c. A.P.T. until the child reaches eleven years, when a Schick test is performed previous to any further inoculations. If the Schick test is positive the child is re-inoculated. Since 1932 8,579 children have been inoculated, and as one can confidently assume that immunisation lasts effectively for three years or longer, a percentage number of children immunised can be ascertained if as an approximation, the population of children under fifteen years is considered to be 6,963. Of this number 3,000 are children under five years. The figure of 8,579 immunised children does not include those children inoculated by private practitioners to whom small quantities of A.P.T. have been given from time to time at their request.

It is necessary to state that no definite figure can be ascertained when the child population is continually changing and is steadily increasing as is shown by the attendance figures of . the elementary schools. In April 1942 there were 3,963 and in December this figure rose to 4,851. 13 CASES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE NOTIFIED DURING THE YEAR 1942. Notifiable Disease. Cases notified in whole District.

During the period from the outbreak of War, a modified procedure has been adopted in regard to food unfit for human consumption, which is surrendered to the Public Health Department. Quite frequently, food which is not unsound but merely unsaleable by retail is included in lots surrendered, and the total quantities are examined with a view to as complete a salvage as possible. The Ministry of Food has a Salvage Department and in accordance with an arrangement with the Ministry officials, the Public Health Department advises them as to the condition of and the categories into which the food may be placed. The food is stored temporarily at the Town Hall Depot arranged for the purpose. Disposal is arranged by the Salvage Officer, payment for the food being collected direct by the Ministry of Food on invoice. Food dealt with includes canned meat, vegetables, fish, fruit and milk, as well as cereals, dried fruits and fresh and frozen meat. On examination by the Sanitary Inspector, food is placed in one of the following categories:— A. Sound and fit for human consumption. B. Sound, but fit only for manufacturing purposes. C. Unsound and fit for animal feeding. D. Unsound and fit for soap or manure manufacture, etc. E. Unsound and for destruction. Since the initial arrangement with the Ministry of Food in April of last year, approximately 17,200 tins of various foods have been surrendered, of which amount 15,000 were salvaged for animal feeding, 1,750 for human food, while only 470 were destroyed. Upward of 20,000 tins of milk have been salvaged. In this case the milk was unsaleable following loss of condition, and has been used for manufacturing purposes or animal feeding, while a small percentage only has been destroyed. The weight of meat dealt with, amounts to some tons, and apart from a few cases where putrefaction had ensued following lengthy time of transport, the whole of this material has been salvaged for manufacturing purposes or as inedible products—manure, etc. Where there is apparent waste or neglect of foodstuffs, faulty storage, etc., such instances are reported to the Food Executive Officers and proceedings have resulted from the transmission of such information. 15 While there is close collaboration with the Ministry of Food, in these matters, there is no change in the administration from the point of view of the Ministry of Health and fhe Medical Officer of Health and the Sanitary Inspectors remain the appropriate officers for examining food as to its fitness for human consumption and for instituting proceedings under the Public Health Act as occasion arises. Milk. There are 17 Dairies registered in the Borough and these are inspected throughout the year, and are kept in a satisfactory condition, having regard to the type of premises. Difficulty had been experienced with a large dairy for some time, poor bacterial counts and complaints with regard to the unsatisfactory state of the bottles—caps being found in the bottles, etc. The facts were reported to the Health Committee, who invited the dairy manager to appear before them to show cause and reason why the dairy should not be removed from the Register. After due hearing of the Dairy representatives, who agreed with the Committee that if certain works and adaptations were carried out there were good prospects for improved conditions generally, the Committee permitted the Licence to be continued for a probationary period on condition that the previously mentioned works could be carried out. These things having been done, the Committee, on the report of their officers, are now satisfied that the registration may be continued. 32 samples of milk have been taken during the year for bacteriological examination. It was observed in 1942 that certain milk purveyors were stacking crates of bottles of milk in unsuitable places on the public footpath and elsewhere so that the roundsmen could have a central place ,to replenish his delivery van. This was considered a very objectionable system as the bottles were subjected to the varying influences of the weather—in summer to the sun rays, in winter to rain and winds—and also were liable to be fouled by dogs. In fact, from the examination of one bottle the latter was no idle theory. The purveyor of milk, on being informed of this objectionable practice, discontinued it forthwith. Slaughterhouses. The Government controlled slaughterhouse has been inspected throughout the year. 16 The smaller slaughterhouse in Hanbury Road was not used much during the year, but in the latter part of the year application was received for the Licence to be transferred to a Company called the Western Abattoir Co. Ltd. The Committee were of the opinion that the new Company should carry out such works as would prevent any complaints as to nuisance, etc., with the result that a satisfactory slaughterhouse together with stables and hanging room has been provided. ACTON & WEMBLEY JOINT HOSPITAL REPORT 1942. The total number of patients admitted to the hospital in the year was 400, compared with 287 in 1941. Of this total, 113 patients were from Acton, 273 from Wembley and 14 from Ealing. Scarlet Fever. 250 cases of Scarlet Fever were admitted. Four mastoid operations were performed during the year, and in 3 cases it was found necessary to puncture the maxillary antra for drainage and lavage purposes. Diphtheria. 53 cases were admitted but in only 21 was the diagnosis confirmed. There were 5 deaths and none of these children had been immunised. Cerebrospinal Meningitis. 6 cases we're treated during the year and there were no deaths. Measles 47 cases were admitted and all treated with M & B 693.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Water Supply. The Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board. 21 Drainage and Sewerage. All the dwelling houses are provided with water closets and are drained into the main sewerage system. By arrangement with the London County Council the sewage is discharged into the London sewers. Storm water is filtered and emptied into the Thames. Public Cleansing. The amount of house refuse collected by the Council in 1942 was 12,901 tons of which 2,318 tons was salvage, the remainder was disposed of by burning at the Destructor.

Ladies and Genttemen We beg to submit the following report upon the schools and the school children of Acton for the year 1942. As requested by the Board of Education, the report will be as brief as possible, while endeavouring to give sufficient data to enable the condition of the children to be assessed and the services supplied to be reviewed. All schools were open for the whole of 1942, during which year 12 additional Nursery Classes were established. The number of children on the roll at the end of the year was 4,806,. including the Special School for Mental Defectives. Medical and Dental inspections were carried out as in normal times, and all Clinics to deal with special defects were in operation. It was not found necessary to call upon neighbouring Authorities under Circular 1523 to help in carrying out the work, although it will be seen by comparing the 1942 figures with those of 1941 that in almost every case numbers seen, examined or treated have gone up. There were no changes in the Medical Staff other than that Dr. M. O. Mann, who performs sessional duties for the Borough of Acton, took over two Medical Inspection sessions per week, but the Dental staff changed during the year. At the beginning of the year the work was carried out by a rota of local dentists, then Mr. Smith, l.d.s. was appointed in January in a temporary but full time capacity, but he was later in the year replaced by Mr. D. Tasker. it has therefore not been necessary to employ any foreign dentists as provided for in Circular 1559. The average Weight and Height figures for the children of 1042 show a slight decrease over 1941 in all groups except the 7 30 year olds, the 9 year olds, and the girl leavers of 13. The decrease is too slight to cause anxiety, but is unexpected in view of the greatiy increased numbers of school meals and milk supplied. Immunisation against Diphtheria was carried out as formerly, and in all cases except Acton Wells School and Southfield Upper the percentage of children inoculated has gone up. A table is included in the report. 11 cases of Diphtheria, however, were notified among children of school age, but of these the diagnosis was unconfirmed in 4 cases, and of the others, none had been fully immunised. Scabies continued to increase during the year in spite of increased surveys in the schools to try and detect sufferers. A table of cases is included in the report shewing the schools affected. Cases were either treated at home or referred to the Cleansing Baths at Kensington. 9 cases had more than one attack during the year. The verminous condition of Acton school children has undergone an improvement. More visits were paid, but fewer children were found to be unclean. This is satisfactory, but much still requires to be done as the same families are found to be infested time and time again, and no real effort is made to keep these children clean after they have been got to a state where they can be re-admitted to school. SCHOOL MEALS AND MILK. Number of meals supplied—1942 109,695 Number of free meals supplied 11,578 Number of bottles of free milk supplied 41,818 INFECTIOUS DISEASES.

REPORT OF THE SCHOOL OCULIST. The numbers referred for treatment have shewn ax- increase during the last year, viz:— 205 Elementary School Children. 19 from the Infant Welfare Clinics. 18 Secondary School Children. In all Spectacles were prescribed and obtained by 196 children. 10 children either left school or refused glasses. 31 required no treatment. 3children have been referred for orthoptic exercises or squint operations. The attendances are still not as satisfactory as desired v. E. Brander. REPORT OF THE SCHOOL DENTAL SURGEON. During the year 1942 regular dental inspection and treatment was carried on in the schools, Mr. N. T. Smith being responsible for the work up to the month of September. The general condition of the children's teeth, especially among the infants, is good in spite of the fact that we are now in the fourth year of war. 30 I would like to draw attention to the great improvement in the oral condition of children today as compared with that of twenty years ago when I was one of the pioneers of School Dental work in Acton.
