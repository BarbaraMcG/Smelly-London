Pursuant to the 198th Section of the "Metropolis Management Act," the Vestry present the Nineteenth Report of their proceedings, under the Acts before mentioned, and of Works completed and improvements effected, during the year ending the 25th day of March, 1875. During the past year, new Paving Works of great extent have been executed, Improvements effected, and Public Lighting increased, in relating to which the Vestry have been actuated by the desire of extending the benefits thereof as widely as possible, endeavouring to avoid any serious increase of local taxation. The Works and Improvements referred to are hereafter specifically described under the respective heads of Sewerage, and Street and House Drainage, &c., at page 5; Highways, New Works, and Improvements at page 6; Lighting matters at page 8; and Sanitary matters at page 10. The Report also contains an account in abstract, showing the Receipts and Expenditure of the Vestry for the year ending at Lady-Day last; also a summary statement of all Contracts entered into, and of monies owing to, and debts and liabilities owing by the Vestry. These accounts have been duly audited by the Auditors, elected by the Parishioners, For the purpose of efficient publication, an Abstract Account, of amounts received and paid by the Lambeth Burial Board, from the 1st day of April, 1874, to the 31st day of March, 1875, is set forth at pages 36 and 37. The accounts of the said Board have been duly audited. THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF LAMBETH.

Complaints of stoppage, flooding, and other defects, have been promptly examined and remedied as far as possible, where the duty of doing so has been with the Vestry. House Drainage. Applications have been made for the drainage of 787 houses, upon which £2785 has been paid into the office. The estimated cost of private work done by the applicants is about £12,000, which has been executed under the inspection and general supervision of the Officers of the Vestry. New Buildings. The Vestry have received notices for building 385 new houses, the drainage of which and the level of the lowest floors in relation to the Sewers, have been considered and approved as directed by the Act. Applications made to the Metropolitan Board of Works for leave to bring out and alter frontages, have been referred by the Vestry and reported upon by them. The approval of the Metropolitan Board has been given to the formation of 21 new streets. 6 THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF LAMBETH.

During the past year 38 Applications have been received for improved Lighting in various parts of the Parish, 32 of which have been acceded to by erecting 48 Lamps, and the removal of 12 others to more desirable positions; G applications have been refused. The number of Lamps lighted by the Vestry at the close of the year ending 25th March, 1875, was 3049; and the cost of Lighting, including the removal of lamps and sundry expenses for the year, amounted to £13,410 10s. 6d. Since last year's Report, endeavours have been made to obtain from the London Gas Company a reduction in their charge for unsuccessfully Public Lighting. The prices of other companies during the past year have not been altered, as no advance was made by them when the London Gas Company increased their rate, The Medical Officer of the Vestry has made periodical Reports of the purity and illuminating power of the Gas supplied by the Phoenix, London, and Crystal Palace District Gas Companies; and such Reports have shewn the illuminating power to be above the required standard by the Act, and free from Ammonia and Sulphuretted Hydrogen, as will be seen by the following Tabular Statement furnished by the Medical Officer.

Gentlemen, In presenting to you the Nineteenth Annual Report on the Health and Mortality of the Parish of Lambeth for the year 1874-75, I am unable to speak as favourably of the District as in my previous Report, the Death-rate being somewhat in excess of the previous year, produced by an outbreak of Scarlet Fever in the early part of the year 1875. The Deaths have increased 162 as compared with last Report; on the other hand, there have been 156 Births in excess of last year. The calculations have been made as usual on the Census Returns of 1871; but, if we take into consideration the estimated increase of population since that period, our Death-Rate will be considerably lower than it appears. The number of Births registered during the year was 8477; 11 of which 2106 were registered in the 1st, 2079 in the 2nd, 2062 in the 3rd, and 2230 in the 4th quarter of the year. The Births were 3332 in excess of the Deaths, and 156 more than in the previous year. The Deaths during the year were 5145, being 162 in excess of the previous year. In all the Districts there has been an excess of Births over Deaths: namely, in Lambeth Church 2nd, 696; Kennington 1st part, 633; Brixton, 595; Waterloo 2nd, 513; Kennington 2nd, 461; Waterloo 1st, 242; Norwood, 178; and Lambeth Church 1st, 14. It appears as if there were an increase of only 14 Births in Lambeth Church 1st, but, after deducting the Deaths in St. Thomas's Hospital of strangers to the District, amounting to 210, the increase of Births over Deaths will be 224. The Deaths during the Four Quarters of the year were as follow:— First Quarter 1037 Second Quarter 1130 Third Quarter 1346 Fourth Quarter 1632 Deducting the deaths of 329 persons which occurred in the Public Institutions in Lambeth of strangers brought, not only from other Districts of London, but from the country, the Deaths of residents in Lambeth will be reduced to 4816. Of the 329 strangers, 210 were at St. Thomas's Hospital; 103 at Stockwell; 9 at the Royal Infirmary, Waterloo Road; and 7 at the Lying-in Hospital, York Road. The Births and Deaths during each Quarter of the Year, in each of the eight divisions of the Parish, are shown in Table No. 2; 12 from which it will be seen that in Waterloo 1st there wore 583 Births, and 341 Deaths; in Waterloo 2nd, 901 Births, and 388 Deaths; in Lambeth Church 1st, 772 Births, and 758 Deaths (of the latter 370 occurred in St. Thomas's Hospital, 210 of whom were strangers to the District); in Lambeth Church 2nd, 1734 Births, and 1038 Deaths, (of which 378 took place in the Workhouse)} in Kennington 1st, 1530 Births, and 897 Deaths; in Kennington 2nd, 1070 Births, and 609 Deaths: in Brixton, 1436 Births, and 841 Deaths (154 of which occurred in Stockwell Hospital, of which 103 were strangers); in Norwood 451 Births, and 273 Deaths. The Mortality of Lambeth, as compared with the South Districts and the Metropolis, is shown in Table 3. The Deaths have been 162 more than during the previous year, but this excess can be partly accounted for by the increase of population. The most healthy Districts were Kennington 2nd, Brixton Waterloo Road 2nd, Kennington 1st, and Norwood, the Deathrate being respectively 19.50, 20.85, 21.01, 21.72, and 21.76 per 1,000. If we deduct the deaths of strangers at Stockwell Hospital, the Death-rate would be 20.85 instead of 23.70 per 1000 in Brixton. The less healthy Districts were Lambeth 1st Church; Ditto 2nd; and Waterloo 1st; the Death-rate being respectively 38.88, 28.96, and 24.22 per 1000 ; but deducting 210 deaths of Strangers in St. Thomas's Hospital, the rate of Lambeth Church 1st will be reduced to 28.11 per 1000. By the same Table it is shewn that one person in every 40.73 died in London during the year; one in 41.30 died in the South District: and one in 40.51 died in Lambeth. 13 In the Waterloo Road 1st, one in 40.81 died daring the year; in Waterloo 2nd, one in 47.59 died; in Lambeth Church 1st, one in 25.70 died: but when we deduct the deaths of Strangers in St. Thomas's Hospital, which is in that District, the proportion would be one dead to 35-57 living. In Lambeth Church 2nd, one in 34.53; in Kennington 1st, one in 46.04; in Kennington 2nd, one in 51.28; in Brixton, one in 42.50; but, deducting the deaths of Strangers in Stockwell Hospital, which is in that District, the proportion would be one to 47.90; and in Norwood, 40.41. The Deaths from Epidemic Diseases, during 1874-5, are shewn in Table 4. They amounted to 807, and, as compared with last year, shew a decrease of 40. The Epidemic Diseases which shew any increase, as compared with last year, are Small Pox, Scarlet Fever, and Diphtheria; the deaths from these three Diseases were as follow:—24 from Small Pox, as compared with 13 last year; 12 of these were Strangers brought to Stockwell Hospital; 202 from Scarlet Fever, as compared with 31 in the previous Report; 13 of these were Strangers; 44 from Diphtheria, as compared with 31 of last year; of the 180 Deaths from Fevers (including Typhus and Typhoid, 07 were Strangers. Fevers, Diarrhoea, and Measles, shew a decrease, especially the latter disease, the numbers being 55, as against 192 last year. At Table 5 will be seen the number of cases of illness from Contagious Diseases, attended by the Poor Law Medical Officers, during each quarter of the year. The total number, 527, as against 605 last year, shews a considerable decrease. The decrease was chiefly in Measles, there being only 19 cases, as compared with 185 the year before; there were only 3 cases of Small Pox, as against 7. Scarlet Fever, however, shews an increase from 37 last year to 85 this, and 14 Fevers of all classes (including Typhus, Typhoid, and Simple continued) have increased from 90 to 139; there was the same number of cases of Diarrhoea, but a decrease in Whooping Cough from 45 to 34. Taking all the circumstances into account, the severity of the winter, and the sudden changes of temperature, the Returns of Contagious Diseases attended by the Poor Law Officers are satisfactory. The number and character of the Nuisances removed, and the general Sanitary Measures carried out, will be seen in Table 1. The Nuisances attended to amounted to 2,589; in addition to which there was a large amount of Sanitary Work carried out by disinfecting houses and rooms where Contagious and Infectious Diseases existed. The number of Houses cleansed was 269; houses drained, 149; cesspools abolished, 17; obstructed drains remedied, 370; defective drains trapped, 247; houses without proper water supply provided therewith, 804; houses not provided with means of ventilation, 18; houses where dampness and foul smells existed remedied, 6; 74 yards repaved and lime-washed; 303 dust bins erected; 195 accumulations of dung, garbage, &c., removed; 33 cases of decomposed animal and vegetable matter removed; 14 foul urinals cleansed, removed, or improved; 15 closets provided or improved; 75 dangerous structures removed; 1 trade nuisance abated; 47 lots of swine, consisting of 175 pigs, removed; 3 lots of unwholesome fish, numbering 217, condemned and destroyed; 2 offensive Pools abolished; 2 Ballast burning nuisances abated; 22 obstructed or untrapped gullies, remedied; 2 cases of animals improperly kept in houses, removed; 48 houses registered under the Sanitary Act of 1866, 29 & 30 Vict., cap. 90. Total number of Nuisances attended to, 2,589 In addition to the above, 313 houses have been cleansed and disinfected, in which Small Pox, Fevers, and other infectious 15 diseases have occurred, and various Sanitary improvements effected therein; and, in 349 cases, articles of bed and bedding similarly infected were either disinfected or destroyed. The number of Licensed Slaughter-houses visited was 100; Cowhouses 118, and Bakehouses 221, in all of which, the usual periodical cleansing and whitewashing was enforced, and many other improvements effected. In order to complete these necessary works, 1760 Notices were served, and 30 Summonses issued. There have been fewer cases of Zymotic Disease than in the previous year, which is an evidence of the benefit derivable from the persistent Sanitary Measures carried out. Adulteration of Food, Drink, and Drugs.—At Tables 6 and 7 will be found the number of Articles submitted for Analysis, during the year, the number found to be adulterated, and the Convictions with the Fines inflicted. The Inspectors have, as hitherto, discharged their duties most efficiently. I remain, your obedient Servant, M. J. MAC CORMACK, M.B., Medical Officer of Health, Lambeth. TABLE I.
