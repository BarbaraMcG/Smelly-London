11 HAC 37 REPORT on the SANITARY STATE of HACKNEY DISTRICT, DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE YEAR 1857, by JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D., M.R.C.S., M.B.M.S., &c. Medical Offices of Health to the District. Printed by order of the Board, by JOHN COVENTRY, CHURCH STREET, HACKNEY. 1857. REPORT. To the Board of Works for Hackney District. Gentlemen, Although in my Weekly Minutes I have reported to you the result of your proceedings against Mr. Winn for keeping a dust-yard in your District, yet as these Minutes will not be published, and the decision is one of public importance, I am induced again to bring it to your notice. The proceedings were based on the Nuisance Removal Act; the offences we charged him with were as follows:—first, that house refuse was brought to the wharf containing vegetable matter, and offal in a decomposing state. Secondly, that in the process of sifting, the dust, and the fine particles of vegetable matter were dispersed by the wind over the adjacent neighbourhood, so as to prove injurious to those who inhaled them. Thirdly, that the breeze (sifted ashes) contained vegetable matter in a more or less advanced state of decomposition, which, when piled into a heap and wetted by the rain, fermented still more, and evolved effluvia injurious to health. Further, that the rain dissolved the soluble portions of the vegetable matter, and thus impregnated the cinders themselves. The fermentative action was shown, amongst other signs, by the escape of gases and a considerable quantity of watery vapour. We also proved that large accumulations of vegetable refuse, of breeze, dust, and hardcore were allowed to remain on the premises for a longer period than was required for conducting the business. The Magistrate, R. P. Tyrwhitt, Esq., in his judgment stated that he considered all trades which caused the evolution of noxious effluvia should be removed from the Metropolis ; that he was of opinion we had proved the defendant's trade to be noxious and injurious to the health of the neighbourhood ; and also, that as the sifting of the dust was hurtful he could not allow him to continue doing so, and therefore ordered the abatement of the nuisance. 3 Daring the past quarter I have visited several of the cow houses in the District, and have found most of them somewhat overcrowded, illventilated, and imperfectly drained and paved. The latter I consider a most glaring defect, as the urine and other fluids soak between the stones into the earth, and cause at times unpleasant smells. On pointing these out to the proprietors they stated that as soon as the warm weather came the cows would be sent into the fields. I have, therefore, delayed taking any further steps than having the necessary notices served for keeping the sheds clean. I purpose during the summer bringing the matter again to your notice, as the supply of wholesome milk, (which can be secreted by healthy cows alone), is very important. In accordance with my usual custom, I have inspected, in company with the Inspector of Nuisances, a large number of houses and localities in which epidemic diseases have prevailed, and have detected many local causes to account for their severity, and directed in each case those means to be adopted which I considered necessary. I have also inspected many nuisances which could not be abated by the ordinary means; and so successful has the plan been of personally inspecting them under these circumstances, and then summonsing the owners of the property to this Board, that we have not had to take proceedings before the Magistrates in any one of these cases, all cause of complaint having been immediately removed. The number of Births during the quarter ending March 28th, was 603 in the whole District, of which 42 occurred in Stoke Newington, 37 in Stamford Hill, 196 in West Hackney, 225 in Hackney, and 100 in South Hackney Sub-districts. The Deaths from all causes during the same period was 409, so that the Births exceeded the Deaths by nearly one half; of these 31 were registered in Stoke Newington, 27 in Stamford Hill, 96 in West Hackney, 122 in Hackney, and 53 in South Hackney Sub-district. I have prepared a statement of the sickness of the district from the books of the Parochial Medical Officers, from which it appears that 3,455 cases were attended to by them, of which 191 were of epidemic diseases. A comparison between the sickness and the Meteorology shows that the greatest amount of sickness followed the two coldest weeks of the quarter; and that in the six cold weeks, namely those below 40° F., the average number of cases of sickness was 281, and of deaths 34 per week ; whilst in the seven weeks during which the temperature was above 40° F., the average number of cases of sickness was 250, and of deaths 29. These correspond with previous results, and show that cold weather so far from being beneficial, is injurious to health and life. 4 Of the 409 deaths registered in Hackney during the quarter, 167 occurred in persons under 20 years of age; 56 between 20 and 40 years ; 65 between 40 and 60 years ; no less than 96, or nearly one-fourth, between 60 and 80; and 25 above 80 years of age: a most convincing proof of the salubrity of Hackney. Of the 409 deaths no less than 80 occurred in the East London Union and the German Hospital, so that only 329 belonged to the District. Of the total deaths, 59 happened from epidemic and 75 from tubercular diseases, including 56 from consumption; 25 from diseases of the heart, 97 from inflammatory diseases of the lungs, and 31 from old age. The appended Meteorological table shows the mean daily reading of the barometer to have been 29.990 in., that for Greenwich (due allowance being made for higher level) being 29.869 in. The mean temperature of the air for Hackney was 39.3°, for Greenwich 39.2°, the mean daily range for Haokney was 11.7°, and for Greenwich 13.0°. These facts show that the winter climate of Hackney is better than that of Greenwich, as the mean temperature is a little higher, and the daily range less. The pressure of the atmosphere as shown by the barometer was greater than usual in February, and less in January and March ; and varied to a very unusual extent. The mean temperature of the air was about an average for the quarter, but the extreme range was greater than usual. The quantity of rain in January was in excess, in February and March less than ordinary: indeed, so little rain has not fallen in February for the last 46 years. The number of nuisances removed during the quarter was 68 in January, 109 in February, and 95 in March, being a total of 272 in the quarter. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, May 7th, 1857, JOHN W. TRIPE. TABLE I.

TRIPE, M.D., M.R.C.S., M.B.M.S., &c., Medical Officer of Health to the District. Printed by Order of the Board, by JOHN COVENTRY, CHURCH STREET, HACKNEY. 1857. REPORT. To the Board of Works for Hackney District. Gentlemen, During last quarter I have been much engaged in making house to house visitations of the localities in which epidemic diseases have appeared, also in examining the places in which I expected an outbreak of disease, and in adopting such preventive measures as I deemed advisable. In consequence of such visitations extensive drainage works have been performed, numerous cesspools emptied ; also many dilapidated and filthy houses repaired and purified. The following are the localities in which the chief part of these works have been done, viz. in Exmouth Place, East Street, North Street, Barclay Place, Union Street, Pullen's Place, Grove Lane, Lawrence Buildings, Jerusalem Gardens, Margaret Street, John's Place, Bennett's Court, Tryon's Court, Fairy Street, Caroline Place, Bowling.Green Street, Stapleton's Buildings, William Street, and Orchard Street. In most of these places a low form of fever or diarrhoea has prevailed to a rather large extent, but the majority of the cases were slight in character as shown by comparing the mortality from these diseases during this with that of the corresponding quarter last year. In 1856, 10 deaths occurred from diarrhœa, and 15 from typhus, against 4 from diarrhoea, and 9 from typhus, in 1857 ; which is a most satisfactory result, and shows the great influence exercised on the mortality from these diseases by proper sanitary measures. It must not be inferred from this statement that the District in general is in a proper state, or that additional sanitary works are not required, for, on the contrary, a very large proportion of the poorer and very many of the richer localities are without efficient drainage, and very many causes of disease consequently exist. I mean merely to assert that an efficient 3 pervision of the District, and the numerous works performed through the agency of this, the medical department, have assisted materially in preventing the ordinary per centage of attacks from proving fatal. In consequence of several proprietors of noxious trades having omitted to adopt the best practicable means for preventing injury to health, I have deemed it adviseable to require their attendance before you. In two instances, the opinion expressed by the Board has caused two owners of these works to discontinue their manufactures, and it led, in another, to the adoption of the means which were deemed necessary for abating the evil ; but in two other cases it has been necessary to take legal proceedings before the Magistrates, when a conviction was obtained in each. Other persons have attended before the Board respecting unwholesome cow.yards, piggeries, dilapidated dwelling houses, noxious cesspools, and insufficient drainage ; and of the nineteen who have so attended, it has been necessary to take further proceedings against three only. As these nuisances were injurious to health, I have, in all instances, examined the premises previously to the appearance here of these parties, and also in many other similar cases in which the works required were performed immediately after my inspection. The total number of nuisances removed during the quarter by Mr. Valentine, your Inspector of Nuisances, has been no less than 560. These may be divided as follows:— Cesspools emptied, filled up, and drained into the sewer 159 Cesspools emptied 106 Horse, cow, pig, and vegetable refuse removed 28 Rooms lime-washed and purified—dilapidated houses repaired 18 Road gullies cleansed, repaired, &c. 11 Filthy roads cleansed 9 Filthy and offensive places cleansed and purified 9 Pigsties purified, repaved, or removed 12 Foul and offensive drains cleansed or reconstructed 131 Foul and offensive open sewers cleaned out 11 Unwholesome collections of house refuse, &c., removed 66 560 The number of births registered during the quarter have been 565, and of deaths 318 ; the excess of births over deaths being 247, or 177 births to each 100 deaths, being a decided excess of births above deaths compared with the ratio for all London. In the corresponding quarter of last year there were 349 deaths, which corrected for increase of population would have been 363, or 113 in the second quarter of last year to 100 in this. This is very satisfactory, for in the whole of London 100,310 deaths were registered in the second quarter of 1856, against 100,205 in the 4 ponding quarter of this year, and therefore shows that Hackney has been more healthy than the metropolis at large. Of the 565 births, 213 occurred in Hackney sub-district, 37 in Stamford Hill, 36 in Stoke Newington, 181 in West Hackney, and 98 in South Hackney ; and of the 318 deaths, 145 were registered in Hackney District (of which 31 happened in the East London Union), 18 in Stamford Hill, 24 in Stoke Newington, 88 in West Hackney, and 43 in South Hackney sub-districts. Of the 318 deaths from all causes, 41 resulted from 5 epidemic diseases, viz. 10 from measles, 2 from scarlet fever, 16 from hooping-cough, 4 from diarrhoea, and 9 from typhus ; not one having occurred from small-pox. The ages at which death took place were as follows:— 61 in children under 1 year of age ; 86 in persons above 1 and under 20 years of age; 45 in those who were between 20 and 40 ; 50 in those between 40 and 60; no less than 58 in individuals who were above 60 and under 80 ; and 18 above 80 years. Of the total deaths, 48 resulted from zymotic and 69 from tubercular diseases ; 55 from affections of the lungs, 25 from old age, and 9 from violent deaths. The mean pressure of the atmosphere was less than usual, having been equal to a column of mercury 29.859 inches high ; the highest temperature registered during the quarter was 85.4°, and the lowest 31.2°, a range of 54.2°: the mean of all the highest for each week was 71.9°, and of the lowest 39.8° ; the average of the highest temperature for each week was 64.9°, and of the lowest 45.0°; and the mean daily range 19.9°: that of Greenwich being 21.5°. The mean temperature of the quarter was 53.3°, that of Greenwich being 53.8°, and the excess of heat, compared with the average of 43 years, was 1.8°. The mean dew-point temperature was 43.9°; the mean humidity of the atmosphere 69.6 ; saturation being 100, and the average weight of a cubic foot of air was 538.9 grains. The mean daily amount of ozone was 1.8 (10 representing the maximum), having been above four times as much as in the quarter ending Saturday, March 28th. The rain fall was 4.31 inches only in Hackney, and 4.7 inches in Greenwich ; which is 2.7 inches less than the average. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN W. TRIPE. August 8th, 1857.

TRIPE, M.D., Medical Officer of Health to the District. Printed by Order of the Board, by JOHN COVENTRY, CHURCH STREET, HACKNEY. 1857. 2 REPORT. To the Board of Works for Hackney District: Gentlemen, In my First Annual Report, written in February last, I observed that " as we are now entering on a series of warmer years than those we have lately experienced, it is very probable that diarrhoea and other summer diseases will prove more fatal than during the last and preceding years." The opinion thus confidently expressed from a knowledge of the ordinary meteorological phenomena of London, and of their effect upon health, has, unfortunately, been completely verified by the very unusual amount of diarrhoea, bilious and other fevers, which have prevailed in the district during last quarter. The mortality from these affections, great as it has been, affords but a very small indication of the amount of disease which has appeared, for an unusually large proportion of those attacked have recovered. The information derived from various sources, and the inspections which I have made in the localities affected, enable me to make this assertion. The sanitary precautions which have been adopted is most probably the chief cause of this low rate of death. The extent to which fever and diarrhoea have prevailed is shown by the following list of localities in which I have made house-to-house visitations, viz.: Hammond's Cottages, Lea Bridge Road ; Bowling-green Street; Falcon Place ; Park Street; Tyssen Road ; John Street, West Hackney ; Brunswick Grove ; Sandford Lane ; Shacklewell Row ; Wellington Street; John Street, Homerton ; Brook Street, Homerton ; Park Road, in the Wick; Navarino Road; Exmouth Place; Henry Street; Castle Street; Cock and Castle Lane ; Orchard Street; Mount Pleasant Lane ; Assembly Row, Gloucester Place, Frederick's Place, and Tyssen Place, Brook Street; Caroline Street; Matthias' Place ; Hindle Street; Tottenham Square ; Jackson's Buildings; Thomas' Court; Tingey's Buildings ; York Buildings ; Walcot Place ; Payne's Court; and William Street. The chief causes of this extensive outbreak appears to be the want of proper artificial drainage, in consequence of which the soil of the lower becomes saturated with the filth of the upper localities, and from the unusual heat of the weather. It is very evident, as the decomposition of moist vegetable and animal matters depends materially on the temperature to which they are exposed, both as to the rapidity with which it occurs and the products resulting therefrom, that an unusually great summer heat must 3 produce a large amount of those maladies which are influenced, as to their intensity and frequency, by such emanations. In some of these localities the soil is so wet that cesspools dug for drainage purposes become filled immediately they have been emptied, so that an outbreak similar to that from which this District has just suffered, will in all probability supervene every hot summer, until the proposed efficient system of drainage be completed : even then it will most probably happen to a certain extent, but in a less intense form. In consequence of such numerous house-to-house visitations a large number of nuisances have been discovered ; and as many owners of property refused to abate them, no less than 21 persons have been directed to appear before this Board to shew cause why they should not be summonsed to Worship Street. This step has proved sufficient in all these cases to induce them to perform the necessary works, and thus saved the expense and inconvenience of an appeal to the magistrate : four parties, however, against whom proceedings were commenced last quarter have been prosecuted, and eleven attendances at the Police Courts have been consequently required. One case was most important, as it involved a question as to the power of the Magistrates to order the repair of dilapidated roofs, walls, ceilings, and floors of inhabited dwelling-houses : it was contended that the Nuisance Removal Act gave no such power, but we successfully combated that opinion, and obtained an order, under the 13th section, for the sufficient and effectual repair of the premises. The time for the renewal of the licences for slaughter-houses having been fixed for October last, I inspected them in September. I had much satisfaction in finding them in a much better state than at my visits last year ; for, although the majority required lime-washing and cleansing, repair of the paving, &c., yet no extensive structural works were necessary. The nuisances removed by Mr. Valentine, the Inspector of Nuisances, during the quarter may be classed as follows:— Cesspools emptied, filled up, and drained into the sewer 72 Cesspools emptied 101 Horse, cow, pig, and vegetable refuse removed 79 Rooms lime-washed and purified—dilapidated houses repaired 148 Filthy and offensive places cleansed and purified 10 Pigsties purified, repaved, or removed 30 Foul and offensive drains cleansed or reconstructed 82 Other Nuisances 15 Total 537 The births registered during the quarter have been larger than usual, viz., 613, and the deaths 361 ; the excess of births over deaths being 252, against 247 in the previous quarter. The proportion of births in the metropolis was 162, and in Hackney 169, to each 100 deaths, which is a very satisfactory return. 4 The mortality for the quarter was in excess of that in the corresponding quarters of 1855 and 1856; but the same result has occurred all over London—110 deaths having been registered in London and 113 in Hackney against 100 during the summer quarter of 1856. This, considering that the latter was the most healthy season in Hackney for many years, and that the population increases more rapidly in London than in the metropolis at large, is as small an augmented rate of death as could have been expected. Of the 613 births, 240 were registered in Hackney Sub-district: 47 in Stamford Hill; 38 in Stoke Newington; 186 in West Hackney; and 102 in South Hackney: whilst of the 361 deaths, 148 occurred in Hackney Sub-district, (28 of which took place in the East London Union) ; 24 in Stamford Hill; 40 in Stoke Newington ; 101 in West Hackney ; and only 48 in South Hackney. Of these 361 deaths 112 were registered as caused by zymotic diseases, and 67 by tubercular diseases ; 44 from affections of the brain and spinal cord ; 22 only from diseases of the lungs, excluding consumption ; and 23 from old age. There were also 13 registered from poison, hanging, drowning, and accidents. Of the 112 from zymotic diseases no less than 50 resulted from diarrhoea, (of which 35 were of children under 1 year old ;) 19 from typhus and bilious fevers ; 17 from hooping cough ; and 10 from scarlet fever. The deaths at different ages were as follows:—109 were under 1 year of age ; 73 in those who were above 1 and under 20 years of age ; 52 in those between 20 and 40 years of age ; 46 in those between 40 and 60 ; 64 who were above 60 and under 80 ; and 18 who were above 80. The very large mortality of children under 1 year of age, was produced by diarrhoea, premature birth, and atrophy, and was therefore partly accidental. The mean pressure of the atmosphere for the quarter was below 30 inches, and varied rather less than usual; the average temperature was very high, having been no less than 3.5° in excess when compared with that of the last 43 years, and also above the mean in every week but one. The highest temperature registered was 90.2°, which occurred on the last Sunday in June ; and the next highest 86.2°, in the first week of August. The lowest temperature was 44.2°, so that the range was 46.0°; the mean of the maximum observations was 80.7°, and of the lowest 51.2° ; The average temperature for the quarter was 63.4°, being 0.1° higher than Greenwich ; and the hottest summer, with the exception of 1818, of any recorded. The general direction of the wind was S.W., and the rainfall amounted to 9.14 inches, or 2 inches more than at Greenwich. I remain, Gentlemen, your obedient Servant, JOHN W. TRIPE. Nov. 12th, 1857.

TRIPE, M.D., Medical Offices of Health to the District. Printed by Order of the Board, BY JOHN COVENTRY, CHURCH STREET, HACKNEY. 1858. REPOR T. To the Board of Works for Hackney District: Gentlemen, Although the mortality from Cholera has been larger in London than in the corresponding quarter of any year since 1854, yet not one fatal case has happened in this District. Some alarm was manifested in certain Districts of the Metropolis,—especially in the eastern, by the outbreak; but, judging from the ordinary manner in which Cholera manifests itself previously to its occurrence as an epidemic, I do not think any great anxiety need be felt regarding it during 1858, although it is not improbable that it may set in, preparatory to an outbreak in 1859. The mortality from Typhus and Bilious Fevers has been slightly in excess during this quarter, as compared with the last; 21 deaths having been registered against 19. This increase is very small, and as the chief mortality occurred in October, we may hope that the disease will not assume an epidemic form, unless very high temperatures should again prevail. In consequence of this disease and Scarlet Fever having prevailed in numerous localities, I have inspected a very large number of streets and houses. Those in which the chief sanitary improvements have been made are:—Gloster Place, and George Terrace, Brook Street; Orchard Street; Baines' Buildings; Castle Street; Henry Street; Cock and Castle Lane; Robinson's Row; James' Place; Goring Street; Greenwood Row; Matthias' Place; Abbot Street; Urban Place; Albert Street; Duncan Street; Hindle Street; and High Hill Ferry. The total number of houses inspected by me, which required repairs, or improved drainage, were 231 : the majority being in a very bad state. To carry out these and the other improvements noticed in the Inspector of Nuisances Reports, it has been necessary to require 22 owners of property to attend before the Board, to shew cause why they should not be proceeded against, for neglecting to perform the necessary works. Twenty of these obeyed the order of the Board without any further steps being taken ; but, in two, it was necessary to summons them to Worship Street. In relation to the Police Courts, I have to notice the alteration which have been made in an Asphalte Manufactory, in consequence of the legal 3 proceedings which have been taken. The manner in which these works were conducted, allowing the escape of impure creasote in the form of an irritating vapour, necessitated the passage of the vapour through the furnace and their consequent consumption; also the enclosure of the works, so as to prevent the escape of creasote during the ladling process. These the owner neglected to do until summoned, when he did everything I required, and has so abated the nuisance, that the Factory is no longer offensive or noxious to the neighbours. In another case we obtained a decision against a Manufacturer, for neglecting to use properly those means of preventing a nuisance, which he had erected under my supervision. Another very important matter which I have brought under your notice, has been the question of water supply, especially to the houses of the poor. From the peculiarity of the law it has been necessary to refer my Report to the Churchwardens and Vestry, as the Board of Works has no power to compel the laying on of water for domestic purposes. I have, however, succeeded in procuring a water supply for the inhabitants of two streets, and trust to do so in several others. The Nuisances removed by Mr. Valentine, the Inspector of Nuisances, to a considerable extent under my direction, have been as follows:— Cesspools emptied, filled up, and drained into the sewer 79 Cesspools emptied 52 Horse, cow, pig, and vegetable refuse removed 83 Houses lime-washed and purified—houses repaired 60 Filthy places cleansed and purified 5 Pigsties purified, repaved, or removed 13 Foul and offensive drains cleansed or reconstructed 66 Other Nuisances 128 Total 486 As this quarter contains 14 instead of 13 weeks, the number of births and deaths registered are considerably in excess of the average. The total number of births registered in the District have been 656, and of deaths 395; showing an excess of births over deaths of 261. The rate of births to deaths in the whole of the Metropolis was 147 births to 100 deaths; whilst in Hackney it was no less than 164 births to 100 deaths : which shows a very satisfactory state of the public health. In the 13 weeks, ending December 27th, there were 590 births against 568 in the corresponding period of last year. As regards the relative mortality, the Registrar General observes this quarter, that " the increase was equivalent to to 1 in every 22 deaths." This remark applies to the whole of London. Now in the 13 weeks of this quarter, there were 361 deaths against a corrected average of 370 for 1856; and of 409 for the years 1853-4-5. This District has therefore enjoyed a state of health above the average, whilst the whole of London has been unusually sickly. Of the total deaths, 395 in number, 182 occurred in Hackney Subdistrict, (of which 44 happened in the East London Union and the German Hospital); 107 in West Hackney; 26 in Stamford Hill; 55 in South Hackney; and 25 in Stoke Newington Sub-district. Of the total 4 births, 656 in number, 242 were registered in Hackney; 217 in West Hackney; 32 in Stamford Hill; 114 in South Hackney; and 51 in Stoke Newington Sub-district. Of these 395 deaths, 74 were registered as having been caused by zymotic diseases, and 65 by tubercular diseases; 46 from affections of the brain and spinal cord; 14 from heart disease; 80 from affections of the lungs (excluding consumption, from which there were 38 deaths); 25 from maladies of the digestive organs; 27 from old age; and no less than 12 from violent deaths, besides 5 which were registered as "sudden." Of the 74 deaths caused by zymotic diseases 1 was from smallpox; 4 from measles; 19 from scarlet fever; 10 from hooping cough; 9 from diarrhoea; and 21 from the various kinds of fever. The ages at death were as follows:—79 were under 1 year old; 91 were above 1 and under 20 years of age; 51 were above 20 and under 40; 58 above 40 and under 60; 91 who were older than 60 but younger than 80; and 25 who were more than 80 years of age. The mortality of young persons has very much diminished this quarter, as compared with that for the last, whilst the increase amongst old persons has been considerable. The meteorology of the quarter has been very unusual, only 1 week having been below the average temperature; the greatest departure from the ordinary mean occurred in the weeks ending November 7th and December 26th, when the excess was no less than 7.9° and 9.6° respectively. October was warmer than any year since 1771, except in the years 1795, 1807, 1811, 1818, and 1831. November also had a higher temperature, with 9 exceptions, than any year since 1771; and the mean for December was higher (except those of 1806 and 1852) than any other during the last 86 years. The influence of the high temperature of December was very marked, the mortality being small in proportion to the elevation of the thermometer readings. Thus in the week ending December 5th when the mean temperature was 4.5°, the number of deaths were 1428; whilst in that ending December 26th, when it was 9.6°, the mortality was only 1013, being a reduction of no less than 400 deaths. The mean of the barometer readings was 30.032; the mean of all the highest thermometer observations was 58.2°, of all the lowest 39.0°; and the mean of all the ranges was 19.2°. The highest temperature registered was 69.2°, and the lowest 31.6°: shewing the extreme range for the quarter to have heen 37.6°. The average temperature for the quarter was 48.8°, of the dew point temperature 44.9°, and the mean dryness of the air was 87, saturation being 100; and the average weight of a cubic foot of air 546.9 grains. The total rain-fall was 6.71 inches, of which 3.05 inches occurred in one week, being the largest rain-fall since 1824. Your obedient Servant, J. W. TRIPE, Medical Officer of Health.

PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE BOARD. london: charles potter, machine printer, 16, warwick place, kingslakd. 1858. REPORT. HAVING already in my Quarterly Reports pointed out the prominent Sanitary occurrences of the year, it only remains for me to make a resumi of the Mortality and Sanitary condition of the district as a whole. By referring to my First Report,/). 16-17. we ascertain that during the years 1847-55, inclusive, there were 154 births to each 100 deaths, whilst during 1857, there were 163 births to each 100 deaths in Hackney, and in the whole of London only 151 births to 100 deaths. That this result arose from a diminished death rate rather than from an increased birth-rate is shown by the fact that the rate of death in Hackney, after allowing for increase of population, has been comparatively smaller than that for the whole of the Metropolis. This important comparison was instituted for each quarter, and was favourable to Hackney in three out of the four, and the exception was caused by a large mortality in the German Hospital and East London Union. In considering the questions of the number and causes of deaths and of births, I shall include those which have occurred in the East London Union and the German Hospital, but in calculating out the average duration of life and the rate of death during the year, I shall exclude the deaths which have taken place in these Institutions, as they do not DropeilY belong to the district. The following Table shews the number of births in each sub-district during the four quarters of the year, and the proportionate number which were registered in each— TABLE I.—BIRTHS. Stoke Newn. Stamford Hill. West Hackney. Hackney South Hackney.

The totals in each sub-district are as follows—Stoke Newington 167, Stamford Hill 153 ; West Hackney 780 ; Hackney 920; and South Hackney 414 ; making an aggregate of 2434 births. The total number of deaths registered in the quarter was 1484, against 1361 in 1856, but as 53 weeks were included in the former year, the number must be reduced to those registered in the first 52 weeks, viz. 1449. If the number of deaths in 1856 be corrected for increase of population they will be raised to 1426, so that after allowing for disturbing causes we find a larger number of deaths to have been registered in Hackney during 1857 than in 1856. The excess was 23. On comparing the mortality of all London during these two years we find that in 1856 there were registered 56,786 ; and in 1857, 60,150 deaths. The number 56,786 when corrected for increase of populalation, and the mortality of 1857 corrected for the 53 weeks, will be changed into 58,143 for 1856, and 58,719 for 1857, or an excess of 576 deaths in 1857. The increased mortality amounted to nearly 1 per cent, for all London, and was l-6 per cent, for Hackney. A comparison of the deaths during the two years in Hackney, shows that in 1857 there was an excessive mortality of children under 1 year of age ; and on refering to the deaths from Hooping-Cough we find an excess (28) more than sufficient to account for the whole increase. The number of deaths registered in 1854, 1855, 1856, and 1857, corrected for increase of population, were 1588, 1565, 1426, and 1449. The mortality in each of the sub-districts was as follows : in Stoke Newington 120; in Stamford Hill 95; in West Hackney 392 ; in llackney 678 ;and in South Hackney 199- Of the 678 deaths in Hackney sub-district 21 ccurred in the East London Union and the German Hospital.

From the same materials I have been able to calculate the average duration of life. TABLE III.—AGES AT DEATH. HACKNEY DISTRICT. 1857.

These numbers will be more readily comprehended by ascertaining the proportions which they bear to each other. Thus 22 4 per cent, of all the deaths happened in Children under 1 year of age ; 44'9 per cent, in persons under 20 years; 13.8 per cent, in those who were above 20 and under 40; 14-7 per cent, of individuals who were more than 40 but less than 60 years old ; 20*8 per cent, of persons above 60 and under 80 ; and 5*8 per cent, above 80 years of age. 6 Attached to each Quarterly Report for 1857 is a Table shewing not only the age at death but also the diseases from which each person who deceased in the district died daring that year. As it would make this report unnecessarily long to give the details in full, 1 purpose stating the mortality in each quarter for each groupof diseases, alsofrom the six most common of the zymotic class, viz., small pox, measlos, scarlet fever, whooping cough, diarrhoea, and fever which latter embraces common continued fever, typhus, bilious, and nervous fevers. For detailed information as to the maladies included in each group, I must refer to my Quarterly Reports. TABLE IV.—DEATHS, 1857 First Quarter. Second Quarter. Third Quarter. Fourth Quarter.

The second in order of fatality was tubercular which caused a mortality of 2/6, or 18.5 per cent. The third was diseases of the lungs and organs of respiration which were fatal to 252 persons or 16.9 per cent. The fourth in order was diseases of the brain and nerves from which 161 persons died, or 10'9 per cent. In the fifth group, viz., old age and decay, there were no less than 106 deaths registered ; whilst cancer, dropsy, and other diseases of " uncertain seat" were returned as fatal in 80 instances, or 5'4 per cent Diseases of the stomach and digestive organs roduced a mortality of 71, rr 4 8 per cent. Affections of the heart and blood.vessels caused death in 59 instances only, or 3'9 per cent. Each of the other groups of diseases caused a rate of death which was below 3 per cent, viz. violent deaths 42, or 2'8 per cent.; premature birth 37 or 2.5 per cent., Atrophy 25 or 1.7 per cent.; sudden death and diseases of the kidneys 23 each, or 1.6 per cent.; Childbirth 19, or 1.3 per cent.; diseases of the bones and joints 7 or 0 5 per cent, and the others a still smaller rate. The deaths from the chief epidemic diseases were 249 in number, of which 1 was caused by small pox, 22 by measles, 41 by scarlet fever, 67 by hooping couerh, 69 by diarrhoea, and 59 by fever. The following table shows the rate of death from these diseases in each quarter of the year, viz., that measles was most fatal in the spring quarter, scarlet fever in the autumn, hooping cough in summer, diarrhoea, in summer, and fever in autumn. I mention here that the first quarter must be considered winter, as it embraces January and February, the two coldest months of the year, and the last autumn although it includes December. I am compelled to adopt this arrangement as to season, to bring my returns in unison with those of the Registrar General :— TABLE V. 1857. Quarters.

TABLE VI. CORRECTED DEATHS FROM CERTAIN EPIDEMIC DISEASES. Years Small Pox. Measles Scarlatina Hooping Cough Diarrhoea Fever 1855 16 7 81 54 28 70 1856 13 40 52 29 66 63 1867 1 22 41 57 69 59 From this table we learn that small pox produced an extremely small proportionate mortality, that measles was less fatal than in 1856, but more so than in 1855, that scarlet fever caused 11 deaths fewer than in either of the other years, that hooping cough and diarrhoea were more fatal in 1857 than in 1855 or 1856, and that fever has been gradually declining in fatality during each of these years. This latter is a subject for congratulation, for so far as it could be ascertained, it attacked afar larger number of persons in 1857, than in either of the other years. We have therefore good reason for assuming that the sanitary measures adopted under this Act, have had much influence in producing this lower rate of death from fever. In order to calculate out the rate of death and the mean duration of life of the population of this district, it was necessary to ascertain the number of persons who died within its limits, excluding the deaths in the East London Union and the German Hospital, and the ages at which they died. The results thus obtained are not absolutely correct, but will be a near approximation, as it is impossible to ascertain how many persons leave the district ill, and die elsewhere from diseases which commenced whilst they were living in it. The age at death is therefore somewhat too high, and to correct it absolutely, all the deaths of denizens of Hackney, which take place in the Hospital* and Infirmaries of the Metropolis, and their ages at death should be ascertained and added to those registered in the district. As this cannot be done, it is better to eliminate deaths in Hospitals altogether, so that a yearly comparison of identical data can be made. Another error may arise from the calculated number of inhabitants not being correct. Having premised these observations, I proceed to state, after making the necessary deduction', I have ascertained there were 608 persons who died between the day of birth and the 20th year; 158 between the 9 20th. and 40th. years; 80 between the 40th. and 60th. years ; 24S between the 60th. and 80th. years ; and 78 above the 80th. years of life. These give an average age at death of 34'75 years. Calculating the population to have been 71,^73 on July 1. 1857, and having ascertained the corrected number of deaths for the year to have been 1272, we find that 10 persons in each 366 inhabitants died during the year, or 177 in each 10,000 living, This death rate is very low, being only a fraction, 0'7 in 1000 above what may be called a normal mortality and is much below that which existed in the years 1847 — 53. Should the rate of death in this district continue to improve as it has done during the last two years. Hackney district will soon become one of the healthiest in England, as it now is amongst those of the Metropolis. Having calculated the mean age at death, and the number living, out of which one person died in the year, we are in a position to deduce the average duration of life by adding two thirds of the difference between these two numbers to the mean age at death. In this way we ascertain that the mean duration of life of the inhabitants of this district during the year 1857 was 49'31 years ; that is to say that a child born in the district during the year might expect to live 49'31 years, or 49 years, 114 days and 7 hours. The number of nuisances abated by Mr. R. H. Valentine, your Inspector of Nuisances during the year were 1789. The kind of nuisances are shown in the following summary: Cesspools emptied, filled up and drained into the sewer 351 Cesspools emptied 316 Horse, Cow, Pig, and Vegetable refuseremoved 243 Eooms limewashed and purified, dilapidated houses repaired 226 Eoad gullies cleansed and repaired 28 Filthy and offensive places cleansed and purified 78 Pigsties purified, repaved or removed 69 Foul and offensive drains cleansed or re-constructed 337 Foul and offensive open sewers cleaned out 37 Unwholesome collection of house refuse, &c. removed 104 1789 To obtain the removal of so large a number of nuisances, it has been necessary to apply for 13 summonses only at the Police Courts, but a very large number of persons have been required to attend before this Board, for not adopting the proper means within a reasonable time. The Meteorology of the year 1857 was very remarkable, but as the peculiar characteristics of each quarter ha-\e been enumerated in the quarterly reports, I shall be very brief in my present observations.

The mean temperature of this year was 51.2°, which was considerably in excess of the average, the mean dew point temperature was 41.7°, the mean humidity of the air 79.1, saturation being 100; and the total rain fall 24.01 inches. The highest temperature registered during the year was 90.2°, and the lowest 20.2°, and the range consequently 70.0°. The highest temperature was registered at the end of June, and the lowest early in January. The extreme ranges for the different quarters were 44.4° in the first, 54.2° in the second, 41.0° in the third, and only 37.6° in the fourth. The temperature for the first quarter was about an average, that of the second was 1.8° of the third 3.5°, and of the fourth 3.4° above the average of the last 43 years.
