GRUNDY, M.D., M.E.C.S., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health BOROUGH OF WEMBLEY ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the Year 1950 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Health of the Borough for 1950. This Report has been compiled in the following five chapters, four with a statistical appendix, in which the figures relating to the functions of the Public Health Department have been collected together according to the relevant services.

The population of the Borough mid-1950 was estimated by the Registrar-General to be 132,700—Civilian, 132,800—Total. In 1931 (the last census date) the population of the two districts, Wembley and Kingsbury, was 65,197; in 1937 the population had become 114,700, while the last December, 1950, estimate of the Registrar-General is that the population is 132,700. Wembley is the fifth largest County district in Middlesex, those of greater population being according to size—Harrow, Ealing, Willesden and Hendon. 2. In 1950, 1,587 live births were recorded, giving a birth rate of 11.91 per thousand. The number of deaths was 1,030 giving a crude death rate of 7.76 per thousand estimated population. The infantile mortality rate was exceedingly low, the death rate of infants per thousand live births being the record one of 17.01, the previously lowest figure having been 21.75 in 1949. 3. Prematurity of birth and congenital malformation are the main causes of the deaths in very young infants. Much consideration is being given to the problem of prematurity and the possibility of saving premature births at the present time, and from the Wembley figures it is obvious that attack on this problem is now practically the only way one may expect a decrease in infant mortality rates in the Borough. 4 statistical appendix a.

GENERAL HEALTH SERVICES. 1. HOSPITALS. The whole of Wembley lies within the area of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board but hospitals accepting the sick are administered by two Hospital Management Committees, the Central Middlesex Group Hospital Management Committee and the Hendon Group Hospital Management Committee, the two major general hospitals being the Central Middlesex Hospital and the Edgware General Hospital. The Wembley Hospital also accepts general cases but is under the control of the Governors of Charing Cross Hospital. Maternity cases from certain parts of the borough can be admitted additionally to the Kingsbury Maternity Hospital and bookings are undertaken through the Obstetric Out-Patients' Department of the Central Middlesex Hospital. Infectious diseases are normally accepted at the Neasden Hospital or, in case of necessity, at the Hendon Isolation Hospital. Cases of mental deficiency and mental disease are catered for at Shenley and Napsbury Hospitals and arrangements made for the admission of tuberculous patients to a variety of hospitals through the three Chest Clinics serving the area. A list of hospitals is included:— Central Middlesex Hospital, Acton Lane, N.W.10. (ELGar 5733.) Edgware General Hospital, Edgware, Middlesex. (EDGware 8181.) Wembley Hospital, Pairview Avenue, Wembley, Middlesex. (WEMbley 3136.) Kingsbury Maternity Hospital, Honeypot Lane, Kingsbury, N.W.9. (COLindale 6309.)

A service of ambulances and sitting case cars is maintained by the Middlesex County Council as Local Health Authority, whose depots are:— Fire Station, Harrow Road, Wembley. (ARNold 2222 or WEMbley 2222.) Fire Station, The Mall, Kingsbury, N.W.9. (ARNold 2222 or WEMbley 2222.) The authority of a medical practitioner is required for service to be given, except in emergency and accident cases. 3. HEALTH SERVICES.

Only 17 cases, 3 adults and 14 school children were referred to Kensington Medicinal Baths for treatment more intensive than could be given at the Clinics or in the homes. The generalisation remains true that infestation is scarcely a Public Health problem in Wembley. The response of the mothers to the advice given through the School Health Services is most gratifying. 14 5. MORTUARY. The public Mortuary has been in existence for a good many years and the Council are conscious of the fact that the time is approaching when a new one will have to be provided. The site of the existing one is quite convenient from the point of view of its accessibility by public transport yet it is unobtrusive, but it has the great disadvantage that hearses cannot be brought to the door of the Mortuary and the length of carry from the Mortuary to the waiting hearse is over one hundred yards. The building and its planning also fall short of present day standards and so the Council have made provision for a new Mortuary in their five-year plan. At one time it was considered that an appropriate site would have been in the proposed new cemetery at Northwick Park, but as the proposal to have a cemetery there has since been abandoned a fresh site will have to be found for the new Mortuary when it is built. An improvement has been effected by the provision of a cooling chamber which is a self-contained unit capable of being moved when the circumstances arise. 152 bodies were deposited in the Mortuary during the year, the majority of which were on orders from the Coroner so that post-mortem examinations could be made. 15 statistical appendix b.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 1. SERVICES PROVIDED, Notification, investigation, pamphlets issued on the various infectious diseases, exclusion from school of patients and contacts, advice re milk handlers— Disinfection—Hospitalisation generally at Hendon Isolation Hospital or Neasden Hospital, re puerperal pyrexia and ophthalmia neonatorum, Emergency Bed Service, re poliomyelitis at Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, re smallpox at Joyce Green Hospital, Dartford—Notification of tuberculosis—Compilation of tuberculosis register—Weekly and quarterly returns to Ministry of Health and County Medical Officer—Authentication of travellers' inoculation state—Food poisoning notification and investigation— Scabies, arrangements with Royal Borough of Kensington—Complete bacteriological service available at Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, outfits distributed from Public Health Department—anti-toxin available, diphtheria. 2. There is little to note in this Section for the year, as the absence of any unusual infectious disease and the lack of any major outbreak of notifiable disease have not occasioned serious concern during the year. The incidence of common infections of infancy varies slightly from time to time and the figures in the statistical appendix indicate that the experience in 1950 was not unusual or in any way adverse. 3. The supervision of contacts landing from ship or aeroplane called for routine surveillance of 7 persons regarding smallpox and Nil persons regarding typhoid fever. Constant vigilance must be given to persons arriving from infected foreign areas and this supervision must be given with discretion and understanding. 17 statistical appendix c.

FOOD HYGIENE. Byelaws relating to the handling of food have been made by the Council under Section 15 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, and came into operation on the 1st May, 1950. They conform with the Ministry of Food model byelaws. All of the food traders in the Borough were supplied with a copy, together with a request that all possible steps should be taken to ensure compliance with the byelaws. 6,353 visits were paid to food premises by Sanitary Inspectors during the year. Food hygiene propaganda has been by direct approach during the course of these visits and a film show was arranged at the Town Hall in conjunction with the Central Office of Information and the Wembley Clean Food Association. 25 The Wembley Clean Food Association, the formation of which was in the first place sponsored by the Council, came into being in 1950. This Association is run as an independent organisation, quite apart from the Council, although three members of the Public Health Committee were nominated by the Council to serve on the Executive Committee of the Association. The members of the Association are proud of the fact that the organisation is financially self-supporting. The Association has adopted as its motto " Health through Cleanliness".A Code of Practice has been adopted which members of the Association are expected to honour—one of a number of ways in which a voluntary association can help to further the cause of food hygiene and at the same time confound the critics of such associations or guilds. All applications for membership are notified to the Public Health Department and when the Department is satisfied that the applicant can comply with the Code the Secretary of the Association is informed accordingly. Clean Food Certificates are issued to the members and these have been presented by the Mayor at presentation ceremonies held on the stage of local cinemas, with the object of fostering public interest in the activities of the Association and food hygiene in general. The Executive Committee and the Secretary of the Association are to be congratulated on the progress made in the comparatively short time they have been operating, i.e., less than a year since the formation of the Association. 3. THE MILK AND DAIRIES REGULATIONS, 1949; THE MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) * (RAW MILK) REGULATIONS, 1949; THE MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) (PASTEURISED AND STERILISED MILK) REGULATIONS, 1949. A comprehensive summary of these Regulations was given in last year's report. Since then amendments have been made in the original regulations by The Milk (Special Designations) (Raw Milk) (Amendment) Regulations, 1950, and The Milk (Special Designations) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) (Amendment) Regulations, 1950, which are of a technical nature and refer to the prescribed tests carried out in a laboratory. No circumstances arose during the year to make it necessary to take action under Regulation 20 of The Milk and Dairies Regulations (relating to disease communicable to man by consumption of milk). During 1950, 138 dealers' licences to sell designated milk were issued by the Council. 4. WATER SUPPLY. The water supply of the Borough is provided by the Colne Valley Water Co., except for a small 26 area in the southern end, of the district which is supplied by the Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Co., At no time has there been an acute water shortage such as has been experienced in some parts of the country where the supply has been from upland surface sources. In order to maintain an adequate supply in the Borough new mains have been provided by the Company. The supply is pumped from deep wells in the chalk and there is, therefore, little liability to plumbo-solvent action. On the contrary the water is somewhat hard and has been of the order of 200— 220 p.p.m. and most local Authorities within the supply area of the Company would like to see a reduction in this hardiness. Frequent bacteriological examinations have shown the water to be satisfactory. All dwellinghouses in the Borough are provided with a mains water supply. 5. SWIMMING POOLS. The two Swimming Pools belonging to the Corporation have continued to be well patronised during the summer months and have afforded a healthy source of recreation and enjoyment. Water is supplied to both pools from the Colne Valley Water Company's mains and during the season continuous mechanical filtration and chlorination are exercised. Residual chlorine in the water is maintained between 0.2 and 0.5 p.p.m. The Council contemplate installing "break point" chlorination in the near future, which should give an even greater margin of safety, a better control of algæ growth, and give that additional sparkle to the water which is to be desired. 6. HOUSING. During the year, 133 cases of overcrowding were relieved, of which 116 were provided with accommodation by the Council. The number of cases of overcrowding known to the Department at the end of the year was 516. Under the liaison which exists between the two Departments concerned, all cases of suspected overcrowding are referred from the Housing Department to the Health Department for investigation, and all cases coming to the knowledge of the Health Department are notified to the Housing Department. During the year 885 visits were made by Sanitary Inspectors in connection with overcrowding. Similarly, medical certificates received in the Housing Department in support of applications for Council houses are submitted to the Medical Officer of Health for his opinion as to whether the cases come within the Council's scheme of priorities on medical grounds. In addition, where investigation shows that special medical grounds exist (with or without a medical certificate) the Housing Department is notified accordingly. 27 One house was represented to the Council as being unlit for human habitation and a Demolition Order was made by the Council in accordance with Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936. Two houses in respect of which Demolition Orders were made during the previous year were demolished in 1950. In one case legal proceedings were instituted against the owner for failure to comply with a Nuisance Abatement Notice served under Section 93 of the Public Health Act, 1936, in connection with essential repairs to a house and the Magistrates made the necessary Nuisance Order. As the Nuisance Order was not complied with by the owner the Council carried out the necessary work in default and charged the owner with the costs. One owner appealed to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction against a Notice served by the Council to provide a dustbin, in accordance with Section 75 of the Public Health Act, 1936, but the Magistrates dismissed the appeal, The owner then appealed against the Magistrates' decision, to the Appeals Committee of the Middlesex Quarter Sessions, who dismissed his appeal and awarded the Council £5 5s. Od. costs. 7. SMOKE ABATEMENT. Although this subject can in some ways be linked up with the one which follows, the average person is prone to forget or does not realise the large contribution made to atmospheric pollution by the discharges from domestic chimneys. It is estimated that in 1948, for example, nearly one-half of the smoke produced in the country as a whole, came from domestic sources. When more plentiful supplies of electricity, gas and smokeless fuels become available there is no doubt that very substantial reductions in atmospheric pollution will accrue, not only in the domestic sphere but in industry as well. Even now, in Wembley, the use of electricity is almost universal in industry as a means of motive power, and practically all coalfired boilers are used for heating only. One of the difficulties since the war has been the variation in the grade and quality of solid fuels. Automatic sprinkler stokers are particularly prone to operating difficulties, when the grade of fuel varies from time to time. Another difficulty of more recent origin has been the emission of grit from a boiler in which it has been the practice to use coke. As long as this boiler used a graded coke no trouble of any kind was experienced but owing to the fuel situation coke breeze containing a large amount of "fines" was supplied, which gave rise to grit emission. The matter was taken up with the Ministry of Fuel and is still being pursued at the present time. Similar trouble has been experienced from a new boiler installed in an adjoining district. 28 One innovation as far as this Borough is concerned is that the Council have decided to install a standard grit deposit gauge in order that measurements can be taken in collaboration with an adjoining Borough. Close liaison exists between the Borough Engineer's Department and the Public Health Department, so that the Sanitary Inspectors are apprised of any proposals for fuel burning installations and are thus able to advise upon the technicalities of smoke prevention before the installations are made. 8. INDUSTRIAL NUISANCES. Considerable attention has had to be given by the Council and its officers to this subject and a Special Committee was set up to consider these problems which have been principally ones of noise, but also included vibration, dust and effluvia. Section 313 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944, provides that a noise nuisance shall be liable to be dealt with as a statutory nuisance under the Public Health Act, 1936, where any person makes or continues or causes to be made or continued any excessive or unreasonable or unnecessary noise which is injurious or dangerous to health provided that it shall be a good defence in any proceedings in respect of a noise nuisance occasioned in the course of any trade, business or occupation for the person charged to show that he has used the best practicable means of preventing or mitigating the nuisance having regard to the cost and to other relevant circumstances. It should be noted that this Section has not the wide application which the nuisance clauses of the Public Health Act possess, for in the latter case the qualifying phrase is "prejudicial to health or a nuisance"; furthermore Section 313 contains a "defence" clause which is far more reaching than any analogous clause in the Public Health Act. Nuisances from dust or effluvia caused by any trade, business, manufacture or process and being prejudicial to the health of, or a nuisance to, the inhabitants of the neighbourhood can be dealt with under the appropriate provisions of the Public Health Act, 1936. In all cases to which consideration was given industrial premises have been in close proximity to residential zones and have demonstrated the desirability of the two zones (i.e., residential and industrial) being separated by open spaces. The Council have, therefore, had to face these problems, many of which are not capable of a ready solution and regard has had to be paid to the law, the methods of abatement, the willingness of the industrial establishments to meet the situation and the susceptibilities of the residents suffering from the nuisance. It should be admitted at once that the 29 Managers and Directors of industrial concerns involved are generally co-operative and sympathetic towards the residents who raise the matter in the first instance, and the Council's efforts have been directed towards a spirit of co-operation and endeavour rather than attempts at strict enforcement of the law which might quite easily result in failure. Indeed, it is probably true to say that this line of action has achieved more on balance than any statutory action would have done. Practical acoustics (relating to noise) and soil mechanics (relating to vibration) are abstruse subjects and the approaches to problems of noise and vibration may be so varied that the selection of the best approach is often not easy and, in many cases, even when a theoretical solution has been found, takes a considerable time to put into effect. Even then the best that can be hoped for in some cases is mitigation and not eradication. In two instances noise has arisen from wood working tools, particularly circular saws, where dwellinghouses were in close proximity to the factories; fortunately work has not been carried on during the night. Unfortunately, however, there is no known method of preventing noise at the source in the case of machines of this description. In one instance consideration has been given to the possibility of lining the whole of the interior of the factory with insulating material but the estimated cost was prohibitive. The Company concerned have endeavoured, as also have the Council, to obtain other premises more remote from residential buildings as this appears to be the only effective way of dealing with the matter but up to the moment alternative premises have not become available; suitable industrial buildings seem to be as difficult to acquire as dwelling houses. In the second case the factory is much larger but there are a number of openings in the wall facing the houses and the Company concerned have been asked to block up the window openings on this side and to fill in the gaps round a large sliding door which are apparent even when the door is in the closed position and which allow noise to escape from the factory. The Company in the first instance tried the expedient of insulating the trunking used to convey the chips and sawdust from the machines as it was thought that this metal trunking might be amplifying the noise but little, if any, reduction of noise was effected. Another step being taken is to stack timber to provide a baffle wall between the factory and the houses. Noise and vibration from air compressors have figured amongst the problems to be dealt with and in one case a very large fourstage horizontal compressor gave rise to vibrations in the neigh- 30 bourhood. This compressor was in continuous operation so that there was no respite for the residents at night or at week-ends. The vibrations were manifested in the houses in the vicinity and movable articles, especially suspended ones, could be seen vibrating in rhythm with the cycle of the compressor. The effects were also felt by residents in bed and whilst sitting in an easy chair. Even the growing trees and garden hedges and fences could be seen in motion on still days. The electric motor driving the compressor also gave rise to a magnetic whine but a new electric motor was fitted which overcame this objection. At one time noise was also experienced from the air intake but the direction it faced was altered and an efficient silencer was fitted. In an endeavour to overcome the vibration the foundations of the compressor were excavated and added to and at the same time provision was made for isolating the foundations from the concrete floor of the building containing the compressor and although it was thought that there was some diminution of the vibration transmitted to the surrounding soil it did not meet the case so far as the residents were concerned. Further technical consideration was given to the problem and the Company decided to design a balancing gear to overcome the forces set up by the reciprocating parts of the compressor. This balancing gear was subsequently installed and very materially reduced the vibrations transmitted to the surrounding soil. In fairness to the Company concerned it should be noted that they appeared to spare no expense in their endeavours to deal with these problems. At another factory an electrically operated vertical compressor was installed in a leah-to open sided building immediately adjacent to the gardens belonging to houses and although this plant was in operation only in the daytime it gave rise to complaints of noise. The wall of the main factory building reflected the noise in the direction of the houses. Steps taken to reduce the noise included the fitting of a silencer on the air intake; alteration of the direction of the air flow into the air receptacle which it was thought would reduce resonance, insulating the exterior of the metal air receiver also to reduce resonance; the fitting of acoustic material at the top, back and side of the compressor plant to absorb noise and prevent reflection; and the provision of tarpaulins on the open side of the building to intercept some of the residual noise. Although these steps undoubtedly effected some improvement the residents were still not satisfied and the Company concerned ultimately installed a lower power compressor which with appropriate insulation measures brought about a marked improvement. At the same factory, metal grinding and fettling carried on in the open air or partially open space also gave rise to complaints and it is hoped that the 31 pany have been persuaded to discontinue this process albeit the process has not been of long duration or frequency. Another instance of induced vibration in houses can be quoted. In this case an electrically operated air compressor working in the daytime only gave rise to vibration, evidence of which could be seen and felt. Progressive improvements were brought about by the provision of new foundations for the compressor and the fitting of a suitable fly-wheel. One source of noise nuisance to local residents was found to arise from a factory in another borough. Somewhat ironically most of the noise arose from dust extraction plants which had been provided to prevent nuisances arising from dust, one to intercept dust arising from a shot blasting process and the other to trap metallic dust from a metal spraying process. Here again this plant was sited at the rear of the factory but immediately opposite dwellinghouses and was run on day and night shift work. These dust extraction plants were constructed of metal, thus givng rise to resonance and in the first instance attempts were made to insert non-metallic jointing material in the ducts and to brace those parts which were subject to vibration. Consideration was given to lining the factory walls with noise absorbing material to overcome reflection but this proposal was abandoned and a baffle was constructed in front of the plant giving rise to the noise. It was suggested to the Company that a baffle wall should be constructed at the boundary fence of the factory premises but owing to the fact that the boundary fence was on the bank of a river it was considered that such a wall would not be practicable. However, further investigations are proceeding at the present time with a view of constructing a wall of much lighter material than brickwork which would not be liable to displacement by any movement in the river bank but would intercept the noise. Needless to say there has been collaboration between this Borough and the Borough in whose district the factory is situate. At one local factory a serious noise arose from the operation of a wood chipping machine, even though the machine was below ground level. The intensity of the noise can perhaps in some measure be appreciated when it is realised that the machine was capable of disintegrating long lengths of timber into small chips in a matter of seconds. Although the Company were prepared to replace this machine with a less noisy one it was not possible to obtain one until quite recently. In the interim period large storage hoppers were installed to hold a sufficient supply of chips for use during the night shift and thus obviate the necessity for 32 operating the chipping machine during the night; also a certain amount of work was done to the building by lining with acoustic tiles, but owing to the fact that the machine had to be fed by hand and working space was limited the doors had to be left open, with the result that noise escaped by this route. Now the timber is fed automatically to the new machine by a conveyor and the new bnilding is lined throughout in acoustic tiles, with the result that the noise now is almost negligible. Although a perusal of these notes might tend to suggest that ameliorative steps have been by methods of "trial and error" this generally is not so; on the contrary there has been application of various principles, each of which has by itself in some measure contributed to noise or vibration reduction but which together have had a far greater cumulative effect, especially in the absence of any effective measure for the prevention or suppression of the noise at its source. The details set out above are bv no means exhaustive and are intended only to indicate the types of problems which have had to be faced. The Council are fully alive also to the necessity for close scrutiny of applications for planning consent for establishment or extension of industry which may be a source of potential nuisance. 9. MOSQUITOES. In the report for the previous year details were given of two manifestations of mosquito activity, one in the Alperton Ward and one in the Wembley Park Ward. In the former case there was no recurrence during the year 1950; steps were taken to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes in the disused air raid shelters which had been found to be the breeding ground in the previous year. Complaints were, however, received from residents in the Wembley Park area but no evidence could be found of breeding taking place in the Wealdstone Brook, as had been the case previously. Larvae were found in water which had collected in a stack of old motor tyres but specimens of these larvae which were sent to the Malaria Research Station, at Epsom were not identified as belonging to the species Culex Molestus; they belonged to the species Culex Pipiens which is not known to bite human beings. This manifestation appeared to be confined to a brief period in July. 10. RODENT CONTROL. The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, which came into force on the 31st March, 1950, has repealed the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919, from that date. During 1950 the Council continued to operate their Rodent Control Service, for which a 50% financial grant is obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, subject to the conditions laid down by the Ministry. A free service is provided to 33 householders in respect of treatment at private dwelling-houses but in all other cases a charge is made based on the amount of labour and materials used. Three assistants who were trained at the Infestation Branch of the Ministry of Food have continued to be employed on this work, details of which are given in the Statistical Appendix. Two maintenance treatments of sewers were carried out by the Borough Engineer and Purveyor's Department during the year. Although there was an overall reduction in the number of premises found to be infested, there was a slight increase in the number of premises found to be infested with mice. The addition of Antu to the list of approved poisons has been welcome and where it has been used it has been found to be very effective. In accordance with the advice of the Ministry its use has been restricted to those cases in which other poisons have been used without obtaining the desired result. 11. FACTORIES ACT, 1937. No material change has taken place in the types of industries in the borough, which were given in some detail in a previous annual report. The particulars relating to inspections and the defects found and remedied are set out in the statistical appendix. 417 visits to outworkers' premises were made during the year. 12. SLAUGHTERHOUSES. There are no slaughterhouses in use in the Borough. 13. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN CONNECTION WITH FOOD. Legal proceedings were taken in three instances, namely:— Milk supplied in a dirty bottle—defendants fined £5 0s. 0d. and £3 3s. 0d. costs. Foreign matter in jam tart—defendants fined £10 0s. Od. and 10/6d. costs. Foreign matter in milk—defendants fined £5 0s. Od. and £5 5s. Od. costs. The defendants in this case subsequently appealed against their conviction and the Court upheld the appeal and awarded £15 15s. Od. costs. 34 STATISTICAL APPENDIX D.

CHAPTER V. ADMINISTRATION, STAFF, SUMMARY. Separation of the personal health services from environmental supervision has revealed the continuing need for vigilance and effort in the latter field. Despite a century of effort much remains to the sanitarian and epidemiologist. Consequently, whilst these responsibilities still rest with the district Council its officers find remaining to them a satisfying vocation in the sphere of social medicine. The Department is not so large as in the recent past, many staff being transferred to the service of the local health authority, but by enthusiasm and application it has been possible to cover the work, including stand-by and duty periods at weekends and holidays. Dr. Halperin was appointed Deputy Medical Officer of Health for 10% of whole-time on 1st August, 1950, and this medical assistance has enabled medical cover to be provided at all times without undue strain. Once again I am happy to report a deep loyalty and conscientiousness in all members of the staff who have offered to myself and to the Council a service which might form an example of the best traditions of local government. I would conclude in an expression of gratitude to all members of the Council, especially those who served on the Highways, Works and Public Health Committee, and particularly the Chairman, for the admirable way in which they have directed the policy of the Department during the year. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, E. GRUNDY, Medical Officer of Health. Hendon Pristine Works limited. 44, Victoria Road, Hendon, N.W. 4 (19160)
