(b) On the North-Western side between Salvin Street and New Road. (c) On the South-Eastern side— (i.) Between the Easttrn side of the railway bridge over Wandsworth Road and a point half a chain or thereabouts North-Eastward thereof. (ii.) between Albion Road and a point opposite the North-Eastern side of Pensbury-street. 43 45- Clause 23 provided for a contribution by each of the Boroughs where widenings were to be carried out, of one»:hird of the nett cost thereof. 46. Clause 37 proposed to amend Section 12 of the London County Tramways (Electrical Power) Act, 1900, relating to thedrainage of tramway rails and the removal therefrom of the accumulations of matter by providing that such accumulations should be deposited by the County Council in any receptacle for street refuse provided by the Road Authority in the street, and be removed by the Road Authority as other street refuse. 47. This Council objected to the proposal to construct a loop line along Queen's Road, Heath Road and Silverthorne Road, being of opinion that the portion of Wandsworth Road between Silverthorne Road and Queen's Road should be widened, and a double line of tramways constructed there, and also suggested the widening of Wandsworth Road near Union Grove and Nursery Street, and a small widening at East Hill, and that this Council's contribution towards the cost of improvements should be limited to a specified sum. This Council also objected to the proposed amendment of Section 12 of the Electrical Power Act, 1900. That section, which provided that the County Council shall remove all matter removed from the conduit or grooves of tramway rails, was inserted at the instance of the late Wandsworth Board of Works, and has worked satisfactorily. 48. The County Council did not agree to this Council's suggestion as to the construction and re-construction of the tramways in this Borough, and as this Council adhered to its objections the provisions relating thereto were withdrawn from the Bill. 49. The clause relating to the removal of matter taken from the conduits and grooves of tramways was withdrawn and a new clause inserted empowering the County Council and Road Authorities to enter into agreements for such removal. 50. The Bill as amended, was passed and received Royal Assent on the 21 st August, 1907. 51. This Bill would authorise the Medical Officer of the County Council to take samples of milk produced, sold or intended for sale within the county, to enter dairies London County Council (General Powers). 44 within or without the county, and inspect the cows kept therein, and would,empower the County Council, upon a report that tuberculosis is likely to be caused to persons from the consumption of milk from the dairy, to order the dairyman not to supply milk within the county. 52. The Bill would also authorise the Medical Officer of the London County Council to inspect dairies in the case of infectious disease suspected to be attributable to the consumption of milk therefrom, to take samples of milk at any place (including railway stations) within the county, would require dairymen to supply lists of farms from which their supply of milk is derived, and lists of their customers, and to notify the County Council of all cases of infectious disease among their employees, and would prohibit infected persons from milking animals. Sanitary authorities were also to be empowered, with a view to prevent the spread of infectious disease, to require laundrymen to furnish a list of their customers. 53. Clauses 38 and 39 dealt with the subject of the provision of a proper supply of water, and accommodation for the cooking and storage of food in houses let in separate tenements. Clause 40 would prohibit the sorting of house refuse by hand, Clause 41 proposed to make certain sanitary regulations for premises used for the sale, &c., of food for human consumption, Clause 42 would have authorised the County Council to make bye-laws to regulate the conduct of the businesses of a vendor of fried fish, fish curer, and marine store dealer; and Clauses 49—51 proposed to empower Metropolitan Borough Councils to establish, maintain and carry 011 milk depots for the sale of milk for consumption by infants under two years of age. 54. Part VII. related to the cleansing of verminous persons, and would authorise the examination of school children and the inmates of any common lodging-house, and require Sanitary Authorities to secure the cleansing of verminous persons. 55. The Bill also proposed to authorise the County Council to cater at their lodging-houses. 56. The Council presented a petition against certain provisions of the Bill, and the following points were included in the petition, viz.:— 45 (a) Clauses 21-31 (relating to milk) to be amended so as to relate only to milk suspected to be tuberculous, and Borough Council Officers to have the powers sought in their respective districts. (b) That Clause 32 (infectious disease attributable to milk) be objected to on the ground that the proposed remedy should be provided by amending Clause 71 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. and that the County Council should only act upon information of a Medical Officer of Health of a Sanitary Authority. (c) That Clause 33 (taking samples of milk at railway stations) be opposed on the ground that this duty should remain as at present in the hands of the Sanitary Authority. (d) Clauses 34 and 35 (lists of customers to be supplied by dairymen in certain cases, and infectious diseases among dairy servants) that these powers, if granted, should be conferred on borough Councils wno already have powers within the county. (e) That clause 36 (infected persons not to milk animals) be objected to, the matter being provided for in London by Section 69 of the Public Heath Act. (f) That Clause 37 (lists of customers of laundries in certain cases) be amended so as to include list of persons employed. (g) That Clauses 39 and 40 (accommodation for keeping and storage of food in tenement houses and prohibition of sorting house refuse by hand) be opposed as unnecessary. (h) That Clauses 49-51 (power to Borough Councils to establish milk depots) be objected to. (i) That Clause 84 (power to County Council to cater at lodging-houses) be opposed as being unnecessary. With the exception of Clauses 21—31 relating to milk supply, the clauses to which this Counpil objected, and the clauses relating to water supply, sale of food, t>ye-laws as to fried fish shops, &c., catering by County Council, were afterwards withdrawn, and the part of the Act relating to the cleansing of verminous persons amended so as to enable the County Council and Sanitary Authorities to enter into arrangements with respect to such cleansing. 57. The Bill, as amended, received the Royal Assent on the 28th August, 1907. 58. This was a Bill to confer powers on the London County Council with respect to the supply of electrical energv in bulk in the Administrative County of London and London County Council (Electric Supply). 46 certain neighbouring areas in the Counties of Essex, Kent, Surrey and Middlesex. 59. The Bill also provided that the County Council might apply for a Provisional Order to enable them to supply energy to any district within the area of supply in which no supply was afforded, and would authorise the Council and any Companies authorised to supply energy to agree for the supply by or to the Council of energy in bulk or otherwise. 60. The Bill would also authorise the County Council to acquire the local undertaking of any of the scheduled distributors except the undertakings vested in the Borough Councils of St. Marylebone and Woolwich. 61. The Council petitioned against the Bill on the grounds that whilst admitting that legislation was required, as the development of electricity in London was backward, it was not desirable that the County Council should become an authority to supply electricity in bulk or otherwise; that the scheme was ill-considered ; that the proposed area of supply was too large ; that the proposal to purchase the undertakings of the local authorities would involve a large expenditure of public money without adequate return, the generating works of some of the local authorities being probably of less commercial value than the outstanding debts and liabilities; that in the hands of the County Council the undertaking would result in a loss, which under the provisions of the Bill was to be made good out of the County Rate ; and that the undertaking should be established and carried on as a commercial undertaking, the County Council to be the controlling or supervising authority as in the Electric Lighting Acts. 62. The Bill was read a second time in the House of Commons and referred to a Committee, with an instruction that if any power was conferred upon the London County Council to transfer or lease to any company, local authority, body or person any of the powers, duties or liabilities entrusted to it by the Bill, the conditions upon which such power should be exercised should be embodied in the Bill or in a subsequent Bill. After a lengthy enquiry the Committee reported against the Bill. 47 63. This was a Government Bill to enable the Board of Trade by Provisional Order to authorise the compulsory acquisition of land for generating stations by any local authority, company, or person within or without their area of supply or district; the supply of electricity in bulk ; and the supply to railways and tramways partly within and partly without the area; and to authorise the Board, in the case of a Provisional Order for the supply of electricity in bulk only, or in bulk and for power only, to exclude from the Order the provisions as to purchase contained in Section 2 of the Electric Lighting Act, 1888, in respect of the undertaking for the supply in bulk. The Bill was withdrawn before reaching second reading. 64. This was a Bill to provide for uniform scales of charges for water throughout the limits of the Board's supply, the charge for water for domestic purposes not to exceed 5 per cent. of the rateable value. " Domestic purposes" was defined as including water-closets and baths constructed so as not to contain more than 50 gallons, but not including a supply of water for any of the following purposes:—Steam engines, railway purposes, warming or ventilating purposes, working any machine or apparatus, consumption by or washing of horses or cattle, washing carriages or other vehicles, watering gardens, fountains, or other ornamental purposes, cleansing sewers and drains, cleansing and watering streets or roads, fire extinction, flushing drains by means of any apparatus discharging automatically, public pumps, baths, or washhouses, any trade manufacture, or business, and any bath constructed so as to contain more than 50 gallons. 65. The Bill would authorise the Board to supply water by measure, and provided that they should not be bound to supply otherwise than by measure for trade or manufacturing purposes, or to common lodging houses, barracks, &c., and that the charge by measure should not exceed is. per 1000 gallons. The charge for water for public purposes was fixed at 6d. per 1000 gallons. 66. The Council presented a petition against the Bill with the view of obtaining the following amendments :— (a) That, except as hereinafter mentioned, the basis of charges for supply for domestic purposes be rateable value. Supply of Electricity. Metropolitan Water Board (Charges, &c.). 48 (b) That domestic purposes include water for gardens not exceeding an area of one-eighth of an acre, and that gardens exceeding one-eighth of an acre be supplied with water by meter. (c) That there be one uniform rate for all rateable values up to £150 and a lower rate in respect of all rateable values exceeding £150, the higher rate to be charged on the first £150 of any rateable value. (d) That the Water Board should have power to make special arrangements with regard to large properties using very little water. (e) That in exceptional cases the Water Board should supply water by meter if required by consumers. (f) That the charge for supplying and maintaining meters be 7½ per cent. of the cost of the meter; and that the London County Council be the authority for testing meters. (g) That the limit of size of baths exempted from additional charge be extended from 50 gallons as proposed to 80 gallons. 67. The Bill was considered by a joint Parliamentary Committee and, as amended by them, provided that in the case of premises occupied for the purposes of trade or business assessed at more than £300 per annum, the Board may make a rebate of not less than 20 nor more than 30 per cent. ; and that the charge for a supply by meter should be from 7d. to is. per 1,000 gallons. The Bill also fixed the charges for the hire, etc., of meters, and provided that domestic supplies were to include baths of a capacity of 80 gallons and to exclude watering gardens by means of any outside tap or any hose, tube, pipe, sprinkler or other like apparatus. The Bill received the Royal Assent on the 28th August, 1907. 68. This Bill proposed to authorise the Water Board to carry out certain works, amongst which were the construction of conduits or lines of pipes in the southern part of the Streatham Ward, and a new road between Leonard Road and Greyhound Lane, and for the purpose of one of the conduits to make connections and attachments to the bridge carrying Greyhound Lane over the London Brighton & South Coast Railway. The Bill also proposed to authorise the Board to take part of Streatham Common, amounting to 1 acre 2 roods 18 poles, and to construct and maintain telegraphs for communication with works, to require aseparate supply pipe to be laid from the main pipe into each M etropolitan Water Board (Various Powers). 49 separate tenement, and would prevent persons supplied with water other than by measure from fixing tubes or hose to the pipes for the purpose of washing horses or carriages or for watering gardens, washing pavements, etc. The Bill would also authorise the Board to supply, repair, or alter pipes, water closets, apparatus and receptacles permitted by their regulations, and to repair injury to or defect in communication pipes and to recover the cost from the person requiring the same. 69. The Council presented a petition against the Bill, dealing with the following matters :— (а) Depth and position in which conduits or pipes will be laid ; provisions for the protection of the roads and sewers of the Council; for providing that the proposed new road in this Borough shall be formed, sewered, paved and lighted to the satisfaction of this Council; that no posts or wires or aqueducts, etc., be placed upon or over any highway in the Borough. (b) The words "watering gardens or" to be deleted from Clause 61,. which would prevent the fixing of tubes or hose to service pipes. (c) That the charge for the supply and maintenance of meters be per cent. of the cost of the meter ; and that the London County Council be the authority for testing meters. (d) Water Board to be liable for damage to highway caused by the bursting of mains or pipes. . (e) Clause 68 (power to supply cisterns, baths, water closets, appar atus, etc.) to be amended so that the Board shall comply with the requirements of the Public Health (London) Act and Bve-laws. 70. The Council was also represented at a Conference of City and Metropolitan Borough Councils with reference to this and the Charges Bill, and upon considering the resolutions passed at the Conference was of opinion that the power to supply materials should not be conferred upon the Water Board, and that the provisions requiring separate tenements in the same house to be supplied by separate pipes were objectionable and unnecessary. 71. The clause relating to the formation of a new road at Streatham having been withdrawn, the question of garden watering and meter rents, dealt with by the Charges, etc., Bill, and the Council being satisfied with the arrangements made by the 50 Water Board as to the depth and position of mains, the Council did not further oppose the Bill, which received the Royal Assent on the 28th August, 1907. 72. This Bill proposed to give the Company powers with respect to the purchase and use of lands at Mitcham, the consolidation and conversion of stock, and the raising of additional capital. The Bill proposed to repeal the section of the Company's Act of 1867, limiting the price of gas to 5s. 6d. per 1,000 cubic feet, and to fix the standard price at 3s. 9d., subject to the usual sliding scale (to which the Company were not subject). The Bill also contained provisions relating to the illuminating power, the apparatus to be used for testing, and as to penalties for defect in illuminating power, etc. The Company also sought powers to lay pipes in streets not dedicated to public use, to sell, let for hire, or otherwise deal in, but not manufacture, engines, stoves, ranges, etc., to supply in bulk beyond the limits of supply, and to lay mains, pipes and culverts for procuring, conducting, or disposing of oil or other materials used or resulting from the manufacture of gas or any residual products. 73. The Council petitioned against the Bill upon the following matters, viz. :— (a) The financial provisions of the Bill. (ft) That Clause 15 be amended so as to provide that notice as to the sale of stock shall be given to this Council as well as the Councils of other districts in the Company's area of supply. (c) That the proposed standard price of 3s gd. per thousand cubic feet is too high (the present price charged by the Company being 3s. 6d.) and that the proposed reduction of the illuminating power from 15 to 14 candles should carry a reduction in the price of gas. (d) That Clause 30 be opposed with the view of substituting a flat flame burner for the argand burner for testing illuminating power ; that the proposed table photometer be excluded on account of its unreliability, and that local authorities have power to appeal to the Board of Trade to prescribe any other photometer or standard light as well as the Company. (e) That the provisions that the Company shall not be liable to any penalty in respect of any defect in illuminating power unless the average of three consecutive tests made at intervals of not less than one hour be less than the prescribed illuminating power be objected to, and that a penalty be incurred in respect of one test as at present. Mitcham & Wimbledon District Gas. 51 (/) That provisions be inserted for testing calorific power, and for tests to be made at any time, or with greater elasticity as to times, than as prescribed by the Gas Works Clauses Act, 1871. (g) That a proviso be added to Clause 34 similar to that in the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Act, 1900, that before laying or relaying pipes in streets not adopted by local authorities, notice be given to the local authority, who shall notify the reasonable depth and position where such pipes are to be laid. (h) That Clause 40 be amended so that pipes for ancillary purposes may only be laid in this Borough with this Council's consent. (i) That the Company be made subject to the provisions of the Acts which regulate and control Metropolitan Gas Companies. 74. Conferences between representatives of the Croydon and Wimbledon Authorities and this Council and the London County Council were held, and the basis of a united opposition settled. Upon the opening of the second day's proceeding's before the House of Commons Committee, counsel on behalf of the promoters agreed to the following terms, which had been previously settled by the Local Authorities and the London County Council, and the opposition was thereupon withdrawn :— (a) The standard price to be 3s. 2d. (3s. gd. proposed by the Bill). (b) Additional capital £240,000 (,£300,000 proposed by the Bill). Borrowing powers £80,000 (£100,000 proposed in the Bill). Also power to borrow a further sum of £15,000 in respect of the old capilal. (c) The amount of undivided profit which the Company may carry forward in any half-year to be limited to the amount required to pay half a year's dividend at the authorised rate on the paid-up capital of the Company for the time being. (d) A sub-paragraph to be added to Clauses 10 and 11 of the Bill (Insurance Fund and Renewal Fund) defining the term "paid-up capital" therein as £180,000. (e) Clause 24 (charge for gas supplied by means of prepayment meters) from the Model Bill to be inserted. (/) The proviso with respect to preferential treatment in the Model Bill (page 62, lines 13 and 16) to be inserted in Clause 2, page 3, line 7. (g) The Company within one year from the passing of the Act to provide a testing station with a building and the necessary apparatus, and to maintain the same, on a site to be provided by the Company at or near Haydon's Road in the Borough of Wimbledon. (h) Clause 30 (2). The photometer used for testing illuminating power to be the Bar Photometer. (The Bill provided that it should be the Bar 52 Photometer or the Table Photometer. The latter was objected to by this Council's Gas Examiner.) (i) Clause 30 (2). The Local Authority as well as the Company to have the right to apply to the Board of Trade for approval of the use of any other burner, photometer or standard light. (j) Clause 30, omit sub-clauses 4 and 5. (As to Company not being liable to penalty except upon the average of three consecutive tests.) (k) Part of Clause 5 of the South Suburban Gas Act, 1906, to be inserted in the Bill (as to testing for the calorific power and illuminating power with flat flame and incandescent burners, but without liability to penalties). (l) Clause 34 of the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Act, 1900, to be inserted in the Bill in regard to the laying of mains in private streets— mains to be laid not less than two feet nor more than two feet six inches below the surface as required by local authority. (m) All future mains laid by the Company in any street to be at a depth of not less than two feet unless the consent of the local authority is obtained. 75. The Bill received the Royal Assent on the 4th July, 1907. 76. This Bill provided that the consent of the owner, lessee, and occupier of a dwelling-house to the use for burials of any ground used or appropriated for a cemetery, mentioned in Section 9 of the Burial Act, 1855, shall not be and shall be deemed never to have been required in any case where the dwelling-house is or was begun to be erected after any part of that ground has or had been so used or appropriated; and was promoted to meet the case of burial authorities whose cemeteries would be affected by the decision in "Godden v. Hythe Burial Board," to the effect that the above-mentioned consents must be obtained, even if the house is erected after the ground had been used or appropriated for a cemetery. This decision would have seriously affected the use of cemeteries, and a Conference of Burial Authorities was held at Lambeth, at which this Council was represented, and a resolution was passed calling attention to the unsatisfactory state of the law in the matter and to the necessity of the immediate amendment of Section 9 of the Burial Act, 1855. A deputation was appointed to wait upon the Government, and the President of the Local Government Board introduced the above Bill, which received the Royal Assent on the 21 st December, 1906. Burial Act, 1906. 53 Local Authorities (Transfer of TreasuryPowers). 77. This Bill provided that the Local Government Board should exercise, as regards every local authority in England, except the London County Council, any powers conferred on the Treasury by any enactment contained in, applied by, or incorporated with the Baths and Washhouses Acts, or the Burial Acts, or any local or private Act, as respects dealings with property, loans, and matters connected therewith. The Council took no action with regard to the Bill, which received the Royal Assent on the 4th August. South Eastern & London, Chatham & Dover Railway. 78. So far as related to this Borough, this Bill proposed to extend, for a period of two years from the 6th August, 1907, the time for the compulsory purchase of lands and the execution of works in connection with railway widenings near Wandsworth Road Station, authorised by the Company's Act of 1900. No action was taken by the Council thereon, and the Bill became law on the 4th July, 1907. Butter and Margarine 79. This was a Bill to make further provision with respect to the manufacture, importation, and sale of butter and margarine and similar substances. On the Bill coming before a Committee of the House of Commons a new clause was inserted extending the powers contained in the Margarine Act, 1887, so as to enable Inspectors of Weights and Measures to take samples of margarine. The Council deemed it inexpedient that such powers should be conferred on Inspectors of Weights and Measures, and petitioned the House of Lords to strike out the clause. Justices of the Peace (No. 2). 80. This Bill dealt with the qualification of County Justices, and provided that a solicitor might be appointed a County Justice, and that any person who was a Justice of the Peace by virtue only of his office might be excluded from the exercise of his functions by the same authority by which other Justices can be removed from the Commission of the Peace. The Council made no order on the Bill, which passed and received Royal Assent on the 4th August. Advertisements Regulation. 81. This was a Bill to authorise Local Authorities (in London the County Council and the City Corporation) to make bye-laws with respect to advertising hoardings and the exhibition of advertisements. The Council 54 sented a petition in favour, and suggested to the County Council that a provision should be inserted in the Bill to the effect that the bye-laws before being made should be submitted for the consideration of the Metropolitan Borough Councils, by whom they are to be carried out. The County Council stated in reply that the Home Office authorities were not prepared to accept an amendment to give effect to the suggestion. The Bill was passed. Education (England & Wales). 82. This Bill, introduced by the Government, provided that schools should not be recognised as public elementary schools unless provided by the local education authority, and contained provisions for the continuance of existing voluntary schools as provided schools, and with respect to religious instruction, the transfer of teachers and their duties, and other matters. It also dealt with the making of schemes with respect to educational endowments and the powers of the Board of Education as to the administration thereof, and proposed to authorise the establishment of a central education authority for Wales. In the opinion of the Council the Bill would have laid a heavy burden upon the rates and taxes of the country without effecting any corresponding improvement in the means of education, and, in view of the Education Acts of 1902 and 1903, unnecessary. A petition was, therefore, presented against the Bill, which passed the House of Commons, and, after considerable amendment, was read a third time in the House of Lords. It was, however, eventually withdrawn. Education (Administrative Provisions). 83. This Bill would, amongst other things, give the Local Education Authority the same powers with regard to the purchase of land for the purposes of higher education as they now possess for the purposes of elementary education, and powers with respect to the appropriation and alienation of land and buildings. The Council being of opinion that, with regard to higher education, the Metropolitan Borough Councils should be consulted before the site of a school is determined upon, and should also appoint Managers of higher elementary and secondary schools, as is now done in the case of elementary schools under Section 2 of the Education (London) Act, 1903, presented a petition for the alteration of the Bill to this effect. The amendments asked for were, however, not madeand the Bill received the Royal Assent on the 28th August, 1907. 55 Education (Bpecial Religious Instruction). 84. This was a Bill providing for the payment to the Local Education Authority by the Managers of non-provided schools in which religious instruction is given which would not be permissible in a school provided by the authority under Section 14 of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, of a sum equal to one-fifteenth part of the sum paid in salaries to the teachers who have been employed in the school and have given that instruction. The Council petitioned against the Bill on the grounds that the Local Education Authority does not pay rent for the school buildings, and, assuming that one-fifteenth to fourteen-fifteenths is the true proportion of denominational to secular education in non-provided schools, then the Local Education Authority should in justice pay to the Managers fourteen-fifteenths of the rental value of the buildings as rent; and that the Bill should not be passed unless a provision to that effect was inserted. The Bill was withdrawn. Elections (Meetings in Schoolrooms). 85. The object of this Bill was to entitle any Member of Parliament, or of County, District, or Parish Councils, or Boards of Guardians, and any candidate for election to such bodies, for the purpose of holding a public meeting in furtherance of their candidature, to the use of a suitable room in any public elementary school upon payment of a fixed charge. The Council petitioned for an alteration of the Bill so as to include Metropolitan Borough Councils in its provisions, but the Bill, after passing the House of Lords, did not reach second reading in the Commons. Factory & Workshop Act (1901) Amendment. 86. The object of this Bill was to distribute the working hours in laundries more regularly over the week, to substitute for the present variable periods of employment a fixed hour in the morning and another at night before and after which respectively work was not to be carried on, and to bring within the scope of the Factory Act, religious and charitable institution laundries, and the smaller laundries where long hours and insanitary conditions are frequently found. A petition was presented by the Council in favour of the Bill, which was afterwards dropped. Home Work Regulation. 87. This was a Bill to provide for the better regulation of home industries and required that all dwellingplaces in which work is done shall be certified by D 56 H.M. Inspector of Factories. The Council petitioned against the Bill, which was dropped before reaching second reading. Public Health Officers. 88. This Bill related to the qualification and tenure of office of Medical Officers of Health in Urban Sanitary Districts, and provided that Inspectors of Nuisances outside London should be called Sanitary Inspectors, and that Sanitary Inspectors, including those in London, should be appointed or removed only with the consent of the Local Government Board. The Council was of opinion that Sanitary Inspectors should be under the control of the Council by whom they were employed, and presented a petition against the Bill. The Bill was dropped before second reading. Public Health (Regulations as to Food). 89. This was a Government Bill to enable regulations to be made for the prevention of danger arising to public health from the importation, preparation, storage, and distribution of articles of food and drink intended for human consumption. The Council petitioned against the Bill on the ground that definite details should be given as to the extent and nature of the suggested regulations. The Bill received the Royal Assent on the 28th August, 1907. Sutton District Water- go. The London Brighton & South Coast Railway Company having proposed to sink a well near the Carshalton springs of the River Wandle, with the intention of conveying the water thus obtained along their railway for the general purposes of the railway, the above Bill was promoted by the Sutton District Water Company last Session, with the object of preventing water being obtained within the water company's area of supply for sale or use beyond that area without the express authority of Parliament being first specifically obtained, the water company being of opinion that the proposed well would affect the quantity of water available for their purposes and would also considerably reduce the quantity of water in the River Wandle. The Council presented petitions to both Houses in favour of the Bill, which received Royal Assent on the 4th August, 1906. Street Betting- 91. As mentioned in the last report (p. 39), two Bills were introduced (one in each House) providing that any person frequenting any street or public place for the purpose of betting shall be liable for a first offence to a 57 penalty of not exceeding £10, for a second offence £20, and for a third or subsequent offence, or where the person committing the offence has any betting transaction with a person under sixteen years of age, to a fine of £50 or to imprisonment for not exceeding six months. The Council presented petitions in favour of the Bills. The House of Commons' Bill was dropped, but the other Bill passed and received Royal Assent on the 21st December. 92. No action was taken with regard to the other Bills abovementioned. Patriotio School. 93. The London County Council in April, 1906, gave notice of their intention to accept the transfer from the Patriotic Fund Corporation of the school at the Royal Victoria Patriotic Asylum, Wandsworth Common, under the provisions of the Elementary Education Act, 1870. This Council objected to the proposal on the grounds that the school was a non-local one providing for the education of children from all parts of the country, that there did not appear to be any need, financially, for the transfer, and that the Corporation ought not to be relieved of their responsibility to maintain the school; and also asked the Board of Education to be allowed to be heard against the proposal. The Board of Education replied that they had considered this CounciPs representations, but, in view of the facts that the children in the asylum were resident in London, that the Patriotic Fund Corporation did not propose themselves to continue the school if the transfer did not take effect, and in that event it would be necessary for the County Council to find school accommodation for the children, involving the erection of a new school, they were not prepared to refuse to consider the proposal on the grounds of this Council's objection. The transfer was sanctioned and took effect on the 1st January, 1907. For the purposes of management the school has been added to the Garratt Lane, Swaffield Road, and Wandsworth Guardians Schools Group. 94. The Council has also had before it the subject of the expiration of the lease of the land belonging to the Patriotic Fund Corporation adjoining the asylum, and the London County Council were asked whether they had taken any steps with the view of the acquisition of the land to add to Wandsworth Common ; but the County Council replied that they did not see their 58 way to take any steps in the direction indicated. The County Council was then informed that this Council trusted that the County Council would see that the land in question was not built upon. Powers, duties and experience of Managers. 95.

(b) That this Conference is of opinion that Head-teachers in provided schools should, in all ordinary circumstances, be selected by the Local Managers of the School (where the vacancy exists) from three candidates on the promotion list prepared by the Education Committee of the London County Council. (c) That in the opinion of this Conference power should be given to Managers of schools of every kind to grant holidays, within limits that may be prescribed, on occasion of local festivities, etc. (d) That in the opinion of this Conference it would tend to greater efficiency in provided schools, and better feeling among the teachers, if all complaints of irregularities of conduct on the part of teachers were reported to the Managers of the schools in which they occur, instead of tothe Staffing Sub-Committee ; it then being the duty of the Managers to consider such complaints, to determine them, and finally to report to the Staffing Sub-Committee. (e) That the Borough Council and the Managers co-operate to carry out the new bye-laws re the employment of children of school age. (/) That the School Correspondents should supply at the monthly meetings figures to show the attendances of the Managers of the different groups of schools. 96. A copy of the resolutions was forwarded to the London County Council, to each of the Metropolitan Borough Councils, and to the Managers of the schools in the Borough. 97. The subject of the carrying out of small repairs at schools has been considered by the Council, and a resolution was passed to the effect that the Council recognised the urgent need of some means of carrying out these repairs more expeditiously than they are carried out under the existing system, and was of opinion that the Chairman of each body of School Managers should be empowered to order petty repairs of an urgent nature to be carried out at once, locally, submitting bills for the same periodically to the London County Council. Sites for Schools. 98. A site for a new school at the corner of Wimbledon Park Road and Standen Road, Wandsworth, was scheduled co the Education Board Provisional Order Confirmation (London, No. 1) Bill. The Council had 61 already approved of the site. The Bill received the Royal assent on the 4th August. 99. The County Council informed this Council that they had decided to take steps for the compulsory purchase of a site for a new school at Cambourn Road, Wandsworth. The Council approved the proposal, but called the attention of the County Council to the fact that this Council was not consulted before the site was determined upon as provided by Section 2 (2) of the Education (London) Act, 1903. 100. The County Council has also decided to increase the accommodation of the schools at Fountain Road, Franciscan Road, Broadwater Road and Smallwood Road. Southfields School site 101. With reference to the proposal of the London County Council to erect another school on part of the site of the Southfield Council School, referred to in the last annual report, a deputation from this Council waited upon a Sub-Committee of the Education Committee of the London County Council in support of this Council's objection to the proposal. The Council was subsequently informed that the SubCommittee had given careful consideration to the representations of the deputation, and that, having regard to the fact that the Board of Education had sanctioned the erection of a school on the site, the Sub-Committee were not prepared to recommend the Council to depart from its decision to erect the school. Higher Elementary Schools. 102. The subject of the higher elementary school accommodation in the Borough was considered by the Council, and the attention of the County Council was called to the necessity for the provision of further schools of this description, there being only one of these schools (Aristotle Road) in the Borough, and the Council suggested that the West Hill School, Wandsworth, should be converted into a higher elementary school, and other provision made for the ordinary scholars at the school. 103. The Aristotle Road School, Clapham, having been recognised as a higher elementary school, the Board of Education decided, under the provisions of Section 2 (3) of the Education 62 Act, 1903, that the school was not of a local character, and the school was thereupon withdrawn from the group to which it was attached, and a separate body of Managers appointed therefor. The County Council has appointed, as Managers of the school, the persons who were Managers of the group to which the school was formerly attached—Bonneville Road and Haselrigge Road. The Council is in communication with the London County Council as to the number of Managers of the two other schools, which, by reason of the withdrawal of the Aristotle Road, should be reduced from 18 to 12. Secondary Schools and Training College Accommodation. 104. The Council has had before it reports of the London County Council on the subject of the provision of secondary schools and training colleges, and asked the County Council to supply information as to proposed sites in this Borough. The County Council, however, stated that the negotiations were proceeding and that it was not desirable to make public the information, and pointed out that the County Council is empowered to take such steps as may seem desirable, after consultation with the Board of Education, to supply education other than elementary, and that this procedure differs entirely from that with regard to elementary education which requires the County Council to consult the Borough Council whenever it is proposed to acquire a site for a new public elementary school. The Council also learned from a report of the London County Council that such Council had purchased the house "Mayfield," at West Hill, Wandsworth, for a secondary school. This Council informed the London County Council that it viewed with great concern the acquisition of this house for a school on account of the consequent depreciation of the rateable value of property in the neighbourhood, and was of opinion that the site was very unsuitable, and also asked the County Council to invite the suggestions of Borough Councils with regard to sites for secondary schools before they are decided upon. Mixed Schools. 105. The subject of the desirability of mixed schools has again been considered, and the Council decided to call the attention of the London County Council to a report of H.M. Inspector upon the Haselrigge Road School, and to the resolution passed at this Council's Education Conference in October, 1905, and adopted by the Council, that in the 63 opinion of the Conference the policy of making the County Council schools mixed departments should be discontinued and separate departments established for boys and girls, and asked the London County Council to carry the resolution into effect. The Council was informed that its communication on the subject had been submitted to the Committee of the London County Council concerned. University Honours. 106. The Council addressed a communication to the Managers of the Haselrigge Road and Aristotle Road Schools, Clapham, congratulating Messrs. Harrison and Woodward, ex-scholars of the Haselrigge Road School, and the Managers and staff of that school, upon the success of Messrs. Harrison and Woodward at the Mathematical Tripos at the University of Cambridge. The Managers thanked the Council for its congratulations and stated that they would communicate the terms of the Council's letters to Messrs. Harrison and Woodward. Infantile Mortality. 107. The Council was represented at the Conference held at Westminster, on Infantile Mortality, by Alderman Gay and Councillor Mark Robinson—Chairman and Vice-Chairman respectively of the Public Health Committee. The President of the Local Government Board attended the Conference and gave an address. The Prime Minister afterwards received a deputation on the subject. Milk Snpply. 108. A Conference of the Public Health Committee and the registered milk vendors in the Borough was convened by the Council and held on July 17th, 1906, to consider the following subjects, viz. :— (1) What methods could be adopted to provide that the milk supply to London might be properly protected from contamination at the time of milking and during transit. (2) Any representations that might be made to the proper authorities, if necessary with the assistance of other local authorities in London, to ensure the adoption of such methods. (3) Any other methods or suggestions that might contribute to the cleanly distribution of milk in London. 109. At the Conference, which was attended by the Members of the Public Health Committee and by 54 registered dairymen 64 and keepers of milkshops in the Borough, the following resolutions were adopted, viz. :— (1) That the Board of Agriculture be urged to bring into force and carry out the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order in the country, with such variations as are applicable in the various districts. (2) That the Board of Agriculture be requested to take steps to ensure that the udders of the cows, and the hands and arms of the person milking, shall be clean at the time of milking, and that the vessel used shall be clean and be kept solely for the purpose of milking. (3) That in the opinion of this Conference all Railway Companies carrying milk should provide proper insulated trucks, as now used by the London and North-Western Railway Company for the purpose. (4) That the Board of Agriculture be urged to take steps to ensure the carriage of milk in sealed churns. (5) That in the opinion of this Conference all dairies should be licensed annually, and only licensed dairies should sell milk for consumption on or off the premises, and that all milk on the counter for sale in open vessels should be covered with muslin or other suitable cover. (6) It was generally admitted that preservatives are not necessary. 110. With a view to the delivery of milk in London free from dirt a copy of the resolutions was sent to the Board of Agriculture and the other Metropolitan Borough and City Councils and they were asked, if they approved, to support such resolutions. Several of these Councils expressed their approval and communicated their views on the subject to the Government Department. 111. The Council was represented at a Conference held at Southwark on the 30th May, 1906, with reference to the sale of milk, warranties, etc., when the following resolutions were passed, viz. :— (a) That in the opinion of this Conference the provisions of Section 25 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, and Section 20 of the Food and Drugs Amendment Act, 1899, operate to the prejudice of the purchaser and the public health and should be repealed, leaving the seller of milk to his remedy at common law against the person from whom he purchases it. (b) That notices in shops, etc., to the effect that milk sold therein is not warranted as pure shall be no defence. (c) That the act of mixing water or separated milk with whole milk for the purpose of sale, shall be made a penal offence. (d) That any Metropolitan Borough Council should be enabled to sample at any railway station milk coming to dealers in the area of that Borough, although the station may be in another district. 65 (e) That copies of the foregoing resolutions be forwarded to the President of the Local Government Board and the President of the Board of Agriculture. Preserved Foods. 112. The following resolutions, which were passed by the Society of Medical Officers of Health on the subject of tinned and preserved foods, were considered by the Council, viz. :— That in the opinion of the Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health, it is necessary, in order to secure better protection for the public in regard to tinned and preserved foods, that legislation should be passed embodying the following important reforms :— (1) That the name and address of the manufacturer and the date of canning should be impressed on the cans. (2) It shall be unlawful to sell for any purpose canned goods that are unfit for human consumption, and it should be the duty of any person in possession of unsound canned foods to notify and surrender same to the local authority, who should destroy such unsound food free of charge. (3) A certain number of tins (say one per cent.) from each consignment should be opened on importation and the contents examined under the supervision or instructions of the sanitary authority concerned prior to such canned foods being placed on the market. (4) Tins which are known in the trade as "doubtfuls" should be deemed to be unfit for human consumption. (5) Food intended for canning should be inspected by independent officials prior to being canned, and all foods should be canned under strictly hygienic conditions. (6) In the opinion of the Branch, the use of preservatives in canned food is unnecessary and should under no circumstances be permitted. 113. The Council were informed that such resolutions had been forwarded to the Local Government Board, the Board of Agriculture, the London County Council, and the City and Borough Councils. The Council agreed with the resolutions except with regard to the number of tins opened, which the Council was of opinion Should not be so great as one per cent., and communications were addressed to the Local Government Board, the Board of Agriculture, and the London County Council in support thereof. The Council also supported the suggestion of the Poplar Borough Council that local sanitary authorities should have the 66 same right of entry and of the institution of legal proceedings, in respect of factories where food is prepared, as is possessed by Factory Inspectors under Section 135 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, and that the provisions affecting such factories should be extended to places where food is prepared other than factories. Infant Life Protection. 114. The Council considered the resolution, passed by the Society of Medical Officers of Health, with reference to the provisions of the Infant Life Protection Act, 1897, suggesting that the Act should be amended in order to provide for the control of persons receiving for hire or reward for a period of 48 hours one or more infants under the age of five years, and that in London the controlling authorities under the Act should be the Borough Councils. The Council agreed with the resolution, and a communication was addressed to the Local Government Board in support thereof. 115. Other information relating to public health is contained in the Medical Officer's Report, Appendix L. Openings in Roads. 116. The Borough Council has again had under consideration the inconvenience caused by the works carried out by different authorities having powers to break up streets. The London County Council having suggested that that Council should be empowered to make regulations dealing with the matter, the Borough Council decided not to object to the proposal, subject to the regulations being approved by a majority of the Borough Councils before confirmation, and to their administration being left entirely to the discretion of those Councils. The subject is still under the consideration of the County Council. Metropolitan Traffic; Board. 117. With reference to the report of the Royal Commission on London Traffic, the Hammersmith Borough Council urged that, in the event of the creation of a Metropolitan Traffic Board, the Borough Councils should be directly represented thereon by jointly-elected delegates; but this Council did not see its way to concur in the proposal. The Council was, however, in favour of the formation of a Traffic Board for London, consisting of not more than five nor less than three members, preferably the latter, as suggested by the 6 7 missioners, and asked the Government to promote a Bill in Parliament to give effect to this proposal. A deputation, arranged by the Browning Hall Conference on Housing, attended before the General Purposes Committee of the London County Council in July last, in support of steps being taken to secure the immediate appointment of a Traffic Board in accordance with the views of the Royal Commission. Councillor Walker represented this Council on the deputation. Motor Traffic. 118. A number of complaints having been received during the past year of the annoyance caused by motor omnibus traffic, the Council called the attention of the Commissioner of Police thereto, as the omnibuses are licensed by the police before being put on the roads. In reply to the Council's communications the Commissioner stated that he had given his special attention to the problems presented by the general introduction of motor omnibuses and was satisfied that the police were fully alive to the necessity of strictly enforcing the law in all cases, that whenever vapour was seen to be emitted by motor omnibuses the matter was reported by the police and particulars sent to the London County Council for any action to be taken which that Council might consider desirable; that in consequence of the action of the police in taking proceedings against drivers exceeding the 12 mile limit and also in communicating with the proprietors on the subject, the drivers were now more careful as to speed; that the attention of the proprietors had already been drawn to the practice which was beginning to obtain of repairing and oiling omnibuses at standings, and that although in a few cases oiling continued, repairing had ceased, and he (the Commissioner) had made representations to the proprietors as to the nuisance caused by the dropping of lubricating oil; and that the police were taking what steps they could to abate the nuisances complained of. The police have since been able to arrange for these omnibuses to be restricted to the main streets, as far as possible, and the annoyance to inhabitants of residential roads has thereby been considerably lessened. 119. A Conference convened by the Islington and Kensington Borough Councils with the view of joint action being taken to promote legislation for controlling the motor traffic of London was held at the Westminster City Hall in January last, this 68 Council being represented by Alderman Hewett, Councillors Law and Eastwood. The following resolutions were passed at the Conference and forwarded to the Home Secretary, the President of the Local Government Board, and the Commissioner of Police, viz. :— (1) That in the opinion of this Conference it is desirable that action should be taken without delay to secure a more effective control and supervision of the Motor Traffic in London, more particularly the heavy locomotives and motors now used for haulage purposes. (2) That the Commissioner of Police should be empowered, after consultation with the City and Borough Councils, to define the routes along which motor omnibuses should be allowed to run. (3) That the attention of the Commissioner of Police be called to the nuisance caused by the dropping of oil upon the roads by motor omnibuses, particularly at turning or stopping places, and that he be urged, before licensing these vehicles, to see that the same are provided with means to prevent grease or petrol dropping therefrom on to the roadways, and further to see that such means are duly used. (4) That in the opinion of this Conference it is incumbent upon the Commissioner of Police to exercise the greatest possible care in the licensing of drivers of motor omnibuses, in order that no unqualified driver may be employed, and that the safety of the public may be fully ensured. (5) That the Commissioner of Police should be empowered to prevent the use on the streets of any locomotives or traction engines which, either alone or with trailers, are unduly noisy, or otherwise unsuitable for road transport purposes, particularly during the night. (6) That it is desirable that all locomotives and trailers used in the streets should have proper springs, and that the tyres of the wheels should be shod with material as noiseless as possible. (7) That in the County of London the number of trailers to a locomotive should be reduced from three to two, exclusive of any wagon solely used for carrying water for the locomotive. (8) That copies of the resolutions passed by the Conference be forwarded to the Home Secretary, the President of the Local Government Board and the Commissioner of Police, with the request that the representations contained therein may receive their careful consideration, and that early effect may be given to the same by legislation or otherwise. (9) That communications be addressed to the Motor Van, Wagon and Omnibus Users' Association and other similar societies, and also to the City and Borough Councils, pointing out the desirability of their using india-rubber or other noiseless material on the tyres of the wheels of their motor vehicles. 69 120. The Council decided to concur in the resolutions Nos. 1 to 8, but did not see its way to agree with the resolution No. 9. A deputation, upon which Alderman Hewett represented this Council, subsequently waited upon the President of the Local Goverment Board and the Home Secretary in support of the views of the Conference. Streatham Tramway Extension. 121. The Borough Council has again had under consideration the subject of the suggested extension of the London County Council's tramways at Streatham. A new proposal has been made for the construction of a line of tramways from the Streatham terminus along Streatham High Road and Mitcham Lane to the county boundary at Roe Bridge so as to serve the neighbourhood of Mitcham Lane, where the population is rapidly increasing. As it was found that the extension of the tramway from the Tate Public Library to the county boundary at Norbury was not among the County Council's Parliamentary proposals for next year, the Borough Council, on the 31st July last, decided to ask the County Council to include in its applications to Parliament next Session, the scheme proposed by the County Council in 1902, for a double line of tramways along Streatham High Road and the widening of that thoroughfare to 60 feet in connection therewith, the Borough Council reserving its right to oppose the Bill containing the scheme. Both proposals are under the consideration of the Highways Committee. Wandsworth to Putney Tramways. 122. The Borough Council had under consideration a scheme, proposed by the London County Council, for widening Upper Richmond Road and East Hill, Wandsworth, and the formation of a new road from Buckhold Road to Broomhill Road, in connection with the suggested construction of tramways from the existing tramway terminus at East Hill, via East Hill, High Street, Wandsworth, West Hill, Upper Richmond Road, and High Street, Putney, to join the authorised tramways at the south side of Putney Bridge, the existing tramways in North Street, York Road and Red Lion Street forming a loop, and other loop lines being provided via Buckhold Road, the proposed new road, and Broomhill Road, and via Oxford Road and Putney Bridge Road, so as to avoid further extensive street widenings. The London County Council asked whether, in the event of the improvement being undertaken, the Borough Council would 70 give its consent to the tramways, and to the reduction, where necessary, in the width of the footways, and would contribute onethird of the nett cost (estimated at £59,250) of the necessary street widenings. In reply the County Council was informed that the Borough Council was of opinion that, in view of the proposed construction of the tramways, the widening of the thoroughfare from Lambeth to Putney advocated by the Royal Commission on London Traffic as an arterial street improvement—the only such improvement recommended south of the Thames—should be carried out at once, and a double line of tramways constructed in High Street, Wandsworth, in lieu of the loop lines proposed by the County Council; that the construction of a single line of electric tramway in Fairfield Street and High Street would render those thoroughfares very dangerous, the awkward curves at the junction of the roads in the proposed loop line from High Street along Fairfield Street and York Road back to High Street being also very objectionable, and the Borough Council suggested that from High Street, Wandsworth, a double line of tramways should be laid along Putney Bridge Road to High Street, Putney, and thence to Putney Bridge in lieu of the proposed line along Upper Richmond Road, and that Putney Bridge Road should be widened where necessary for the purpose. The Borough Council also submitted to the County Council an alternative plan for the widening of East Hill. Having further considered the matter the Highways Committee of the County Council decided not to proceed with the proposals at present, but expressed the opinon that in view of the importance of the lines in connection with the development of the existing tramways system with which they would be connected, arrangements should be made for their construction as soon as the County Council was in a position to deal with the matter. Wandsworth Road and East Hill Tramways. 123. With reference to the proposed re-construction for electric traction of the tramways in Wandsworth Road, Lavender Hill, St. John's Hill, and East Hill, the London County Council informed the Borough Council in July last, that, owing to the additional street widenings asked for by the Wandsworth and Battersea Borough Councils, the clauses relating to the matter had to be withdrawn from the County Council's Tramways and Improvements Bill of the present Session, that the Highways Committee of the County 71 Council were impressed with the desirability of re-constructing these lines at an early date, and hoped that this Council would be willing to consider some modification of the proposals which it previously put forward, and suggested that, with the view of arriving at an agreement, representatives of the two Borough Councils should meet a few members of the Highways Committee to discuss the matter. The Borough Council consented to take part in the proposed Conference, and the Mayor, Aldermen Lorden and Parker, and Councillor Dawnay were appointed as this Council's representatives. Mitcham Road and Tooting High Street Tramways. 124. In March last, the Borough Council was informed that the London County Council proposed to adopt an underground conduit system of electrical traction for the tramways to be constructed in Mitcham Road, from Tooting Broadway to Tooting Junction railway station, and in Tooting High Street (late Merton Road) from Tooting Broadway to Longley Road, and had applied to the Board of Trade for its consent. This consent has been given; the Borough Council and the County Council have entered into agreements with respect to the necessary widening of the road and the paving works, and the construction of the tramway is now in hand. 125. The London United Tramways Company have constructed a tramway on the overhead trolley system of electrical traction in the portion of Tooting High Street (formerly Merton Road), transferred to this Borough under the recent alteration of the county boundary at Tooting. The powers to construct the line were obtained by the Company before the alteration took place. Tooting High Street Widening. 126. The whole of the property required for widening Tooting High Street (late Merton Road) for the proposed electric tramways from Tooting Broadway to Longley Road having been acquired by the London County Council the widening of the public way has been carried out and the construction of the tramway and the paving works are in progress. E 72 York Road Widening. 127. In pursuance of the agreement with the London County Council, the Borough Council has been pressing forward the negotiations for the acquisition of property needed for widening York Road, Wandsworth, in connection with the re-construction of the tramways there for electrical traction. In a number of cases the claims of the owners have been settled and the land thrown into the public way and paved. Backshaw Road Improvement. 128. The whole of the land required for widening the narrow part of Blackshaw Road between the Lambeth Cemetery and Tooting High Street has been acquired and thrown into the public way. A new sewer has been constructed and the work of paving the road is now in progress. Approach to River Wandle at High Street, Wandsworth. 129. In accordance with the agreement referred to in last year's report, an order has been obtained for stopping-up the approach to the River Wandle at High Street, Wandsworth. Putney Bridge Road Widening. 130. All the property needed for the widening of Putney Bridge Road, near Wandsworth Park, having been acquired, the forecourt walls have been set back ana tne paving works executed. The Borough Council has again been in communication with the London County Council with regard to the proportion of the cost of the various improvements in Putney Bridge Road to be defrayed out of the county fund, but the County Council decided to adhere to the view that a complete scheme of widening should be prepared and submitted before the question of contribution is dealt with. The subject of obtaining the required information is now under the consideration of the Borough Council. Widening at Coiner 01 Upper Richmond Road and Putney Hill. 131. The work of erecting the new London and County Bank at the corner of Upper Richmond Road and Putney Hill having been completed, the land in front has been added to the public way and the necessary paving works executed. The London County Council only propose to contribute one-third of the cost of the improvement, and the Borough Council is in communication with the County Council with the view of obtaining an increased contribution. 73 Putney Bridge Convenience. 132. In connection with the widening of the approach to Putney Bridge from Lower Richmond Road for the proposed electric tramways from Putney to Hammersmith, the Borough Council arranged for a sanitary convenience to be constructed beneath the approach. The work is now being carried out by the London County Council, and the Local Government Board has sanctioned the raising of a loan to defray the cost of the convenience, which will be borne by the Borough Council. Lower Richmond Road Widening and Woodpaving. 133. The Highways Committee have on several occasions had before them the question of the acquisition of property needed for the widening of Lower Richmond Road. In view, however, of the excessive cost which would be incurred by the Council in dealing with some of the premises affected, the Committee did not see their way to recommend the Council to take further action in the matter at present. The Committee hope that a favourable opportunity will occur shortly for completing the improvement, and the subject will continue to receive their attention. 134. The Council has again had under consideration the subject of the desirability of paving the carriageway of Lower Richmond Road with wood, and on the 17th July last two deputations from Putney attended before the Council and urged that immediate steps should be taken with the view of the work being carried out irrespective of any tramway or widening scheme. The London County Council is pressing forward the alterations to the approach to Putney Bridge required for the construction of the authorised tramways from Hammersmith to Putney Bridge, one of the termini of which will be at the eastern end of Lower Richmond Road, and it appeared to the Borough Council that the County Council may desire to extend these tramways to the county boundary on Barnes Common. The widenings already approved, and those which will be necessary in the event of the road becoming a tramway route, will involve certain alterations of the levels, and these could be effected at the least cost by carrying out the paving works at the same time as the widening of the road. Under these circumstances the Borough Council came to the conclusion that it would be advisable, before definitely settling the question of paving, to ascertain whether the London County 74 Council proposes to formulate a scheme for the provision of tramways along Lower Richmond Road, and they are in communication with the County Council on the subject. 135. The number of interments in the Council's Cemeteries Interments for the year ended 31st March, 1905, 1906, and 1907 respectively, was as follows :— 1905. 1906. 1907.

General Report on Testings of Gas supplied to the Wandsworth Borough Council (1) by the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company; (2) by the Mitcham and Wimbledon Gas Company, for the year ended 31ST March, 1907. Another year has elapsed since my general report on the daily testings of gas supplied by this Company from October, 1903, to March, 1906, and it may therefore be of interest to review the results of the continued daily testings to March, 1907. W an d s worth and Putney Gas Company. The standard illuminating power of the gas supplied by this Company is 14 candles. The average illuminating power for the twelve months ended March 31st, 1907, is 14.7 candles; the gas has mainly fluctuated between 14.5 and 15.0 candles, as will be clearly seen from the curve which 1 have constructed from the daily testings (Table 3). Thus, while the illuminating power was somewhat more uniform than in the corresponding periods 1904-05 and 1905-06, the general average is somewhat lower than during those two periods, which showed an average of 15.2 and 15.5 respectively. Table 1 shows the monthly averages of the illuminating power for 1906-07, calculated from daily testings. Illuminating Power. On four occasions during this period I found the gas below the standard illuminating power, viz. :—13.6 candles on October 20th, 1906, and 12.8, 13.6 and 13.9 candles respectively on January 23rd and 24th and March 19th, 1907. Previous to July, 1906, the sulphur impurities other than sulphuretted hydrogen were not allowed to exceed 20 grains in 100 cubic feet of gas, but all tions as to these sulphur impurities were abolished by the Removal of Sulphur Restrictions Act, July 20th, 1906, and forfeitures had already been temporarily suspended for some months previously by the Council at the request of the Company. By this Act, however, by special arrangement with the Company, testing for sulphur impurities other than sulphuretted hydrogen has been continued. Notwithstanding the abolition of forfeitures Sulphur. 146 and the withdrawal of restrictions by Act of Parliament as to the amount of sulphur present in the gas, the Company have very seldom exceeded 30 grains in 100 cubic feet of gas during the twelve months ended 31st March, 1907; the amount has fluctuated between 22 and 27 grains, as will be seen from the curve which I have constructed from the daily testings (Table 3), and the average for the whole period was 24.6 grains. In Table 1 will be seen the monthly averages of the sulphur impurity calculated from the daily testings. 1 still note the somewhat remarkable relation to which 1 referred in my last report (Report of Council for the year ended 31st March, 1906, p. 163) between the amount of sulphur and the illuminating power, and a distinct tendency towards an inverse ratio between the two, as will be seen from a comparison of the two curves in Table 3. There has been no sulphuretted hydrogen in the gas during the year ended 31st March, 1907. Sulphuretted Hydrogen. This has rarely been less than a pressure equal to a column of two inches of water, that is to say, more than one inch above the statutory minimum; daily observations have been made and duly reported. Pressure. The only legislation relating to the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company during the year ended 31st March, 1907, has been the passing of the Gas Companies (Removal of Sulphur Restrictions) Act, 1906, which came into force in July last, and to which I have already alluded above under the heading "Sulphur." I have also made two reports on this Act, one when it was in the Bill stage on January 10th, 1906, and one on December 13th, 1906, some time after the passing of the Act. The main points to be rioted in connection with the gas testing and to which I have previously called attention are (1) the continuance of the testing for sulphur impurities other than sulphuretted hydrogen, (2) testing the illuminating power with flat flame burner, (3) testing the calorific power of the gas, '(4) extension by one hour in advance of the usual times of testing under the Gas Works Clauses Act, 1871. At present the Council do not propose to carry out (2) and (3), but the Act enables them to make these tests at any time. Becent Legislation. 147 TABLE I.

A Bill was brought before Parliament by the Company in Recent March, which, owing to certain proposed clauses Legislation. jn connection with the testing and for other reasons, was opposed by the Wandsworth Borough Council and others. 148 The promoters ultimately agreed to the terms settled by the Council, the London CountyCouncil,and the other Local Authorities opposing the Bill, the main points of which, in connection with gas testing, were the provision of a testing station at Wimbledon within a year of the passing of the Act, in place of testing at the works as at present, and various other arrangements as to testing illuminating power with flat-flame burners, calorific power of the gas, etc., on similar lines to the tests at present in force at Disraeli Road, Putney, in connection with the gas supplied by the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company.

The wages of the men from this Borough, employed on the London County Council and Royal Parks, were paid on Saturday morning at the Town Hall, Payment of wages. 266 Wandsworth, the week's work being from Monday morning to Friday night. The rate of wages was 6d. per hour. The men sent to the Working Colonies receive 6d. per week Family allowance. in addition to their board and lodging, a weekly allowance being made to the family on the following scale:—ios. to the wife, 2s. for the first child under 14, 1s. 6d. for the second child under 14, and 1s. for each other child under 14 years; but in no case was 17s. 6d. to be exceeded. The allowances are paid at the homes of the men on Tuesdays. The men are allowed a furlough at the end of each month, their fares being paid for them. Volunteers. The Committee has not availed itself of the services of additional voluntary workers. Effect of the provision of work. The effect produced upon those who obtained work, through the medium of the Distress Committee, varied according to the character of the applicant. In the case of those anxious to work and keep their homes together it was noticeable that after a week's wages, when nourishing food had been obtained, they gradually improved in efficiency. Advantages of Colony work. Colony work has the advantage of fresh air and healthy surroundings, and of removing men from many local temptations. For various reasons, a number of applicants have declined to leave their homes for any period, preferring to wait for local employment. Experience in Administering the Act. In administering the Act, the Committee found reason to believe that a false impression was created amongst the unemployed, who, after having had the enquiry forms filled up and having received visits from the Investigators as to the correctness of the statements, felt that work was certain. As only 214 out of 961 applicants obtained about seven weeks' work, the disappointed balance lost confidence in the usefulness of the Act, and to some extent also in those administering it. The impression that work was coming also slackened their efforts to obtain employment elsewhere. Methods of Payment. The Committee are of opinion that the best method of paying allowances is that at present in force, viz., at the homes of the men, where assistance and advice can 267 be given when necessary. The Committee have not advocated visits from voluntary workers to the homes of the men employed on the Colonies, preferring to rely upon the official reports of the Clerk and the Investigators. Value of Conferences. The Committee are of opinion that Distress Committee Conferences are of very little practical utility. Value of the "Reserve" System. The system of having a number of "reserve" preference cases in addition to the actual number of vacancies allotted to the various works has been of great advantage, and much time is thus saved in filling vacancies as they occur. Preliminary Investigation. The Committee had referred to them, before investigation, all cases where there appeared to be a technical disqualification, and if the applicant did not comply with the regulations issued by the Local Government Board no further action was taken. All other applications were fully investigated. Apprenticeship. As the information necessary to answer this question was not asked for in the schedule of instructions received from the Local Government Board it cannot be given. It, however, may be of interest to know that a Committee on Industrial Education, with Dr. Macnamara as Chairman, is now sitting considering the apprenticeship question. This Committee has collected a vast amount of very useful information bearing on apprenticeship which the Central Body ought to obtain. There are two and only two possible remedies for the distress Unemployed. of the unemployed. The first is some change of policy which will create, on sound commercial lines, fresh sources of industrial activity. The other and sad alternative is the deportation of these workmen to countries where better conditions for prosperity are made to prevail. ALEX. GLEGG, Chairman. PERCIVAL REES, V ice-Chairman.

REED WELCH. 8 280 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE OF CLAPHAM PUBLIC LIBRARY, For the Year ended 31st March, 1907. The Sub-Committee have pleasure in presenting the Twentieth Annual Report on the work of the Clapham Library. The number of books issued during the year was 94,722 in the Lending Library and 4,874 in the Reference Library (exclusive of books in open cases), being a total issue of 99,596 volumes, and a daily average issue of 412 volumes. These figures show an increase in the Lending Library issues of 493 volumes over the previous year, when the library was open on two more days than in 1906-7. Many of the books most in request in the Reference Library are placed on open shelves, and of the use made of these books no statistics are available. The record of issues of volumes in this department is therefore limited to those for which written applications are made, the number of which is less this year owing to a larger and better selection being placed in the open cases. The number of books now in stock, after allowing for withdrawal of worn-out and obsolete works, is 15,293, of which 12,033 are in the Lending Library and 3,260 in the Reference Library. 3,644 readers' tickets (including renewals) were issued during the year to borrowers ill the Lending Library. On the recommendation of the Clapham Sub-Committee the Council decided that any ratepayer of the Borough of Wandsworth should be eligible to sign as guarantor the application voucher forms of non-ratepaying readers in the Lending Libraries. The exterior wood and iron work of the library building has been re-painted during the year, and several internal structural alterations and improvements effected. 281 On the 1st January, 1907, at the St. Albans Quarter Sessions, a person was sentenced to one month's imprisonment with hard labour, for stealing Kelly's Handbook to the Tilled and Official Classes from the Reference Library. By order of the Council the blacking out of betting news in the newspapers placed in the Reading Rooms has been discontinued. The Sub-Committee desire to express their cordial thanks to the various donors of books, periodicals, etc., during the past year. The Borough Council in November, 1906, appointed Aldermen Bulcraig and Kipling, and Councillors Cundall, Downer, Lidiard, Monday and Richardson, as the Sub-Committee for the Clapham Library for 1907. Alderman Bulcraig was re-elected chairman, and a vote of thanks passed to him for his services in that capacity during the previous year. No alteration has been made in the staff, and the Sub-Committee again have pleasure in reporting their satisfaction of the efficient services of the Librarian and his staff of assistants.

The Sub-Committee in submitting the Nineteenth Annual Report of the Putney Library are again pleased to record a considerable growth in the various branches of its work. In December, 1906, the Borough Council appointed Alderman Parker, Councillors Hoile, Jackson and Radford as the Sub-Committee for 1907. At the first meeting of the Sub-Committee Alderman Parker was elected Chairman for the year. The issue of the Quarterly List of additions to the Library has been continued; this publication has, doubtless, been helpful to the many readers. The question of further protection of the Library from fire has been discussed, and as a means to this end, extra lengths of fire hose have been purchased at a cost of £3 16s. The Finance Committee passed estimates of expenditure amounting to ,£1,103, and during the year this sum has been expended. The Sub-Committee regret to report the death of the Rev. Stephen Todd, who was for many years intimately connected with the management of the institution, and they desire to place on record their appreciation of his devoted services. Owing to very heavy rain storms during the early part of the summer the basement of the building was flooded. During the period under review the following works were carried out under the supervision of the Surveyor:—The decoration of the main corridor, news room and lending department, works for the prevention of a recurrence of the floods in the basement, and the provision of a set of stone steps for better exit from the basement. These improvements were made at a cost of £76. 289 The best thanks of the Sub-Committee are tendered to the donors to the Library. A list of donors will be found on page 294 of this report. Lending Department. During the year 1906-7 there has been an increase in the stock this department of 662 volumes, of these 647 were added by purchase and 15 were presented to the Library. The total number of volumes now available for home reading amounts to 9,270. There has been an increase in the issues from the department of 3,356, the total issues for the year being 67,736, as compared with 64,380 volumes issued during the year 1905-6. Considerable attention has been paid to the old stock. During the year 410 volumes were rebound, 380 have been replaced, and 29 volumes have been withdrawn from the stock as not being worth replacing. The books in this department are shelved in open cases and Reference readers have free access to the books, a privilege Department, which is much appreciated by the residents of Putney. The Reference Library is also used by many persons residing in neighbouring districts. No statistics of the issues of books are available, but approximately 150 persons use the department daily. During the year, 96 volumes have been added, making the total stock at present 2,203 volumes. Magazine Rooms. Early in the year, with a view of relieving the crowded state of the Magazine room, the Sub-Committee decided that the spare room should be used as an additional magazine room. Judging by the use made of these two rooms the action of the Sub-Committee has been fully justified. Thirty-one monthly magazines and reviews, three quarterlies, and 40 weekly periodicals are placed in these rooms. The magazines and reviews are transferred to the lending department at the end of the month, and issued to borrowers for home reading. News Room. The list of newspapers, &c., provided in this room includes 28 daily newspapers, among which are Birmingham, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Manchester and Plymouth daily journals, 55 weekly newspapers and periodicals and 40 monthy and quarterly publications. 290 The Sub-Committee have much pleasure in expressing their appreciation of the satisfactory manner in which the Librarian and his staff have discharged their duties. Tables of information relating to the issues of books, classification, &c., will be found on pages 291-293. For list of newspapers, &c., see pages 295-296.

The number of volumes issued to borrowers was 361,935,. being a daily average of 1,502. This is the highest aggregate issue for one year since the establishment of the libraries. The figures of the previous year were 353,061. The following is a statement of the number of volumes circulated at each library. Lending Library. For reference purposes. Total.

Special attention has been given during the year to the revision . of the stock in the scientific and economic sections of the Tate Library, and many important works have been acquired. After deducting replacements, and books worn out and withdrawn from circulation, the stock at the 31st March numbered 34,503' volumes, distributed as follows:— The Tate Library, Streatham 17,528 Balham Public Library 10,692 Tooting Public Library 6,283 Total .34,503 At the annual stocktaking in July only two volumes (value 6s. 6d.) could not be accounted for.

In June, an Author-List of the books in the Tooting Library was published, and the printing has just been completed of a new Subject Catalogue of the books in the Tate Library relating to Science, Art, Sociology, etc. The Subcommittee hope to issue in the course of the .ensuing year a new catalogue of the books contained in the Balham Library, and catalogus of the Fiction and Juvenile departments at the Streatham Library. The usual lists of additious to the libraries have been issued during the year as well as those relating to topics of the day and other matters of public and local interest. The Reading Rooms are regularly supplied with a comprehensive selection of the leading newspapers and periodicals. The rooms are used extensively by the inhabitants of the district and are open every weekday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., and on Sundays (except during the months of July, August and September) from 3 to 9 p.m. 302 A list of the papers and magazines provided at each library is appended. See pages 307-312. The following is a statement of the receipts from the sale of catalogues, etc., and fines for the overdue detention of books. £ s. d. The Tate Library, Streatham 119 1 3 Balham Public Library 78 16 3 Tooting Public Library 46 9 4 £244 6 10 The Sub-Committee endeavour each year to renovate, wholly or in part, one of the buildings under their charge. Last summer the whole of the Tooting Library was re-painted and decorated. A list of the Donors who have kindly presented books, etc., to the libraries during the past year is given 011 pages 305 and 306. The rapid development now taking place in the district of Tooting and the increasing use that is being made of the Library (the generous gift of Sir William J. Lancaster, J.P., L.C.C.) will necessitate at an early date an extension of the building. The accommodation for books in the Lending Library is becoming inadequate for the requirements of the neighbourhood, and it is expected that by the end of the present year all the available space in this department will be taken up. More room for the public is also needed in front of the counter to relieve the crowding which occurs on busy evenings, making it somewhat difficult for readers to refer to the indicator or choose their books from the show-cases. The Reading Room is likewise very largely attended, and though accommodati-11 has been provided for about 90 readers as many as 100 persons are, occasionally, to be found in the Room at one time. At the Tate Library the increasing demand for works of reference is an indication that the establishment of a separate room for reference library purpjses cannot long be delayed. Last year the number of books consulted at the Streatham Library was 5,630 as distinct from those issued for home reading. 303 These are matters which will shortly need the careful consideration of the Libraries Committee if the Institutions are to be maintained in a state of efficiency. This Sub-Committeee have pleasure in expressing their appreciation of the satisfactory and efficient manner in which the Librarian and his staff have discharged their duties.

GATLAND. 314 SUB-COMMITTEE REPORT, For the Year ended 31st March, 1907. The three Libraries under the charge of this Sub-Committee, the West Hill Library, the Allfarthing Lane Branch Library and that for exchange of books, at Earlsfield, have been maintained during the year with increased usefulness. The cost of the Earlsfield Branch, which had been defrayed by Alderman Lorden for the previous two years, fell upon this SubCommittee, the Council having decided to continue the Branch as before. Mr. G. R. Gatland has been appointed Librarian-in-charge at the Allfarthing Lane Branch vice Mr. A. Nash, who resigned in March, 1906; Mr. L. H. Cousins, Senior Assistant at the West Hill Library, has passed the Library Association Examination for Cataloguing; and Mr. A. E. Macmillan has been made Saturday Assistant in place of Mr. T. Davis, who has resigned. The Librarian attended the Annual Conference of Librarians at Bradford and submitted his report 011 the same. The Library Assistants' Association met at the West Hill Library 011 May 16th, 1906. Mr. John Bell, J.P., a member of the Wandsworth Library Commission from its commencement in 1883 till its absorption by the Borougli Council in 1900, and for many years Chairman, died in October. This Committee sent a letter of condolence to his family. A burglary took place at West Hill, on December 21st—22nd, when £1 was stolen and some damage done. The loss has been met by the Commercial Union Assurance Company. The springs of the swing doors in the Longstaff Reading Room have been leplaced by "Slave" springs. 3i5 "Blacking out" of betting news in the newspapers has been discontinued by order of the Council. It will be seen from the accompanying tables that the issue of books in the lending department has largely increased in the last year, and that since the Council took over the libraries, seven years ago, the increase has been from 83,953 to 124,979 or nearly 50 per cent. The books issued in the reference department at West Hill numbered 4,299, exclusive of those in open cases, as compared with 2,510 last year. The Quarterly List has been issued regularly, and in it have appeared the additions to the West Hill Library from 1903 to 1905; a Fiction and Juvenile Author List of books in the Allfarthing Lane Branch Library; and a List of the books in the Branch for the exchange of books, Eailsfield.

To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report of the health and sanitary condition of the Borough for the year 1906. Population. The population of the Borough has not been estimated by the method advised by the Registrar General as, in consequence of the rapid growth of the Borough, such method would, in my opinion, give fallacious results. The population has been estimated in a similar manner to that adopted in 1905, by dividing the number of inhabitants at the Census of 1901 by the number of rated hereditaments in that year, thus obtaining a factor representing the number of persons per hereditament, by which the number of hereditaments in the middle of 1906 is multiplied. The factor thus obtained does not vary very much from year to year, and, consequently, the estimated population is nearer the truth than the population estimated by any other available method. Table I. shows the population of each Ward and the number of hereditaments in 1901, and the number of hereditaments in the middle of 1906 and the estimated population. A 6 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE I. Ward. Census Population, 1901. Rated Hereditaments, 1901. Rated Hereditaments, 1906. Estimated Population, 1906. Increase since 1901.

Table I. shows that since 1901 there has been a very great increase in all the Wards with the exception of Fairfield, where it has only been very slight. The estimated population corrected for Institutions in 1905 was 285,910, so that there has been in one year an estimated increase of 24,400, while the rated hereditaments have increased from 54,870 to 58,926. Since 1901 the increase has been 83,966, and this increase has been greatest in Tooting, Southfield, and Streatham, and least in Clapham North and Fairfield Wards. The corrected population in Table II. is used to calculate the rates in this Report. The difference between the corrected and uncorrected population is made up by the population in the Public Institutions of the Borough, which are as follows:— Clapham:—Hostel of God. Putney:—The Priory, Roehampton. Streatham:—St. Anne's Home. (St. Pancras parish.) Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum (part of). Tooting:—Tooting Home. Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals— The Fountain and the Grove. Newlands Asylum. Tooting Bee Asylum. Wandsworth:—The Workhouse. Royal Hospital for Incurables. Northlands Home for Inebriates. Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum (part of). H.M. Prison. The total population of these Institutions was about 6,300, but as a considerable proportion of the inmates of the Tooting Home, the Workhouse, and the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals belong to other Boroughs, a deduction of 5,690 made 8 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. from the uncorrected total population gives approximately the corrected population, viz.:—310,310, compared with 285,910 in 1905, and 264,200 in 1904. There are very few Boroughs in the Metropolis where the increase of population has been so marked, and if the present rate of increase continues the population of the Borough at the next Census will be nearly 400,000. Births. During the 52 weeks ending the 29th December, 1906, 7,057 births, 3,648 of males and 3,409 of females, were registered, compared with 6,892 in 1905, 6,917 in 1904, and 6,772 in 1903. In Table III. is shown the number of births, males and females, the birth-rate, and the rate of natural increase for each, sub-district, and for the whole Borough. TABLE III. Births. Rates.

The lowest birth-rate was in Putney, where it was only 17.12 per 1,000; and the highest in Tooting, viz.:— 35.44 per 1,000. The actual number of births registered was lower in Clapham, Putney, and Streatham, and higher in Tooting and Wands- 9 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. worth, compared with the previous year, and the total increase over the whole Borough in the number of births was only 165, although the estimated increase of the population was 24,400. The following Table shows the birth-rate in the Borough, in the five sub-districts, in London, and in England and Wales, for the year, as well as the rates for the previous 10 years, compared with the decennial average.

The birth-rate in each of the sub-districts, with the exception of Tooting, is lower than the decennial average, the greatest 10 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. reduction having occurred in Putney where the rate is 5.04 under this average. In Tooting, however, the rate is 5.68 above this average, while in the whole Borough the rate is 2.73 under it. The rate for the Borough is the lowest recorded, being .90 per 1,000 under the rate for last year. The birth-rate for London was 26.6 per 1,000, compared with 27.02 in 1905, 27.81 in 1904, and 28.95 the decennial average, while for England and Wales the rate was 27.0 per 1,000, compared with 27.2 in 1905, 27.9 in 1904, and 28.68 the decennial average. These rates show that the birth-rate has decreased more rapidly in this Borough than in London as a whole. There is, of course, one fallacy which must be mentioned, viz.:—that the rates for this Borough are calculated on an estimated population higher than the actual. The rate of natural increase, or the excess of births over deaths, was 11.59 per 1,000, compared with 12.50 in 1905, and 13.28 in 1904. This rate was lowest in Putney, viz.:—6.44, and highest in Tooting, viz.:—21.95. As stated in the Report for 1905, the diminution in the birthrate is real, and may be shown by comparing the births per 1,000 married females at ages 15-45. In 1901 this rate was 21.5 per cent.; in 1904, 21.0; in 1905, 19.4; and in 1906 it was only 18.3. In London as a whole this percentage was in 1901-3, 23.4; in 1904, 22.8; and in 1905, 21.9. The Registrar General in his report for London for 1905 with regard to the decline in the birth-rate, says: "There are sufficient grounds for stating that approximately about .21 per cent. of the birth-rate (calculated on the female population 15-45 years) in London during the past 35 years, is due to the decrease in the proportion of married women in the female population of conceptive ages; about .6 per cent. is due to the decrease of illegitimacy; Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 11 while the remaining 73 per cent. must be ascribed to the decreased fertility of married women, which is due in part to changes in their age constitution." 167 births occurred in the Workhouse, 12 of these belonging to Clapham, eight to Putney, 17 to Streatham, 12 to Tooting, and 47 to Wandsworth, 57 to Battersea, and 14 to other places. Of these 167 births, 108 were illegitimate, and of these seven belonged to Clapham, four to Putney, 15 to Streatham, nine to Tooting, 32 to Wandsworth, 30 to Battersea, and 11 to other places. In the Borough, with the exception of the Workhouse, 136 illegitimate births were registered, 35 in Clapham, four in Putney, 33 in Streatham, 29 in Tooting, and 35 in Wandsworth. The total number of illegitimate births registered in the Borough was 203, 42 of which belonged to Clapham, eight to Putney, 48 to Streatham, 38 to Tooting, and 67 to Wandsworth, compared with 165 in 1904. The percentage of illegitimate births to total births was 2.87, compared with 2.4 in 1905, and 3.7 for the whole of London for the year 1905. In the separate sub-districts this rate was, in Clapham 3.0, in Putney, 1.6, in Streatham 2.8, in Tooting 3.7, and in Wandsworth 2.8. Deaths. During the 52 weeks ending the 29th December, 1906, 3,341 deaths, 1,604 of males and 1,737 of females, were registered in the Borough, compared with 3,241 in 1905, 3,296 in 1904, and 3,007 in 1903. The total number of deaths is 100 more than occurred in 1905, but is 738 less than the corrected decennial average. The uncorrected death-rate for the whole Borough was 10.57 per 1,000, compared with 11.12 in 1905, 12.22 in 1904, and 11.69 12 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. in 1903. The average for the decennium 1896-1905 was 12.97, so that the rate for the year is 2.40 lower than the average and is the lowest ever recorded. In the separate sub-districts this rate varied very much, and it was especially high in Tooting owing to the number of deaths occurring in Institutions in the sub-district. The rate was 9.21 per 1,000 in Clapham, 8.89 in Putney, 8.01 in Streatham, 23.61 in Tooting, and 9.78 in Wandsworth. To ascertain the corrected death-rate corrections must be made to the above by the addition of the deaths in Outlying Institutions of persons belonging to the Borough, and the subtraction of all deaths in Public Institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging thereto, whose domiciles were in other parts of London. The total number of deaths, corrected for both internal and external Institutions, was 3,461, compared with 3,320 in 1905, 3,417 in 1904, 3,023 in 1903, 3,328 in 1902, 3,130 in 1901, and 4,158 the decennial average corrected for increase of population. The total number of deaths was thus 697 under this average, compared with 562 in 1905, 110 in 1904, and 433 in 1903. During the year 707 deaths occurred in Public Institutions and 64 in other places not Institutions in the Borough. Of these 771, 611 deaths were of persons not belonging and 160 of persons belonging to the Borough. Table V. shows the total number of Institution deaths arranged according to sub-districts and Institutions in which they occurred, Table VI. the deaths of persons not belonging to the Borough, and Table VII. of persons belonging thereto arranged according to causes of death, sex and age, and Institution in which the death occurred. 13 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The number of deaths in Public Institutions, etc., viz.:—771, is an increase of 42 compared with the previous year. There was, however, only an increase of six in Institutions, but an increase of 36 in other places. In the Hostel of God the number of deaths was 15 more, in St. Anne's Home seven less, in the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum 16 less, in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals 15 more, in the Tooting Home 23 less, in the Prison one more, in the Workhouse one less, in the Royal Hospital for Incurables two less, in the Tooting Bee Asylum 22 more, in the Priory two more, and in other places 36 more than in the year 1905. In the Table it will be seen that in the deaths at other places, 11 occurred in Clapham, 16 in Putney, 17 in Streatham, two in Tooting, and 18 in Wandsworth. Table VI. shows the deaths in Public Institutions, etc., in the Borough of persons not belonging thereto, arranged as to ages, causes of death, and Institutions in which the deaths occurred. As in previous years the greatest number of deaths was due to Old Age, 154 of these having been registered, 60 of males and 94 of females, and of these 116 occurred in the Tooting Bee Asylum. In the Middlesex County Asylum the greatest number of deaths occurred from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, Old Age, and other causes, which include all diseases of the nervous system. In the Tooting Bee Asylum the greatest number of deaths occurred from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, Old Age, Softening of the Brain, Lobar Pneumonia, and all other causes. In the Hostel of God from Tubercular disease of the Lungs and Cancer; and in the Tooting Home from Tubercular disease of the Lungs and Old Age. In the Fever Hospitals one death occurred from Measles, 46 from Scarlet Fever, compared with 50; one from Whooping Cough; 30 from Diphtheria, compared with 20; seven from Enteric Fever, compared with 11; and nine from other causes, compared with 13 in 1905. 16 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Compared with 1905 there were 24 more deaths from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, 20 more from Old Age, and 10 more from Diphtheria; while there were four less from Scarlet Fever, 11 less from Cancer, and 32 less from all other causes. Of the 44 deaths in other places, nine were from Accidental and seven from Suicidal causes. Table VII. shows the number of deaths in Public Institutions in the Borough of persons belonging thereto, arranged according to cause of death, sex, age, and Institution in which the death occurred. The total number of deaths was 160, 84 of males and 74 of females, compared with 119, 66 of males and 53 of females, in 1905. 55 of the deaths occurred in the Fever Hospitals, compared with 50 in 1905; 60 in the Tooting Home, compared with 51; 10 in the Hostel of God, compared with one; six in the Workhouse, compared with five; nine in the Tooting Bee Asylum, compared with five; and 20 in other places, compared with six. These deaths are allocated to their proper sub-districts in Table XV. The number of deaths in Table VI., viz.:—611, and that in Table VII., viz.:—160, make up the total of 771, the total number of deaths in Public Institutions in the Borough as shown in the last column of Table XV., and in column 9 of Table XI. 17 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In the next Table the number of deaths in Institutions outside the Borough is given in detail, but a complete list of these Institutions, with the number of deaths that occurred in each during the year, is given after Table I. of the Local Government Board's Tables. As the Borough is dealt with as one Sanitary District the deaths of persons belonging to other parishes in the Borough in Institutions such as the Fever Hospitals, Tooting, are considered to be deaths in Internal Institutions with regard to the whole Borough, and are not included in the following Tables. The same applies to deaths in the Hostel of God, Clapham, the Tooting Home, the Workhouse, and Tooting Bee Asylum. 19 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE VIII.

The total number of deaths in Outlying Institutions was 731, 381 of males and 350 of females, compared with 689 in 1905, 674 in 1904, and 538 in 1903. Of these 359 occurred in the Union Infirmary, compared with 336 in 1905; 357 in General and Special Hospitals, compared with 343; and 15 in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board,. compared with 10 in 1905. Of the 357 deaths in General and Special Hospitals 76 occurred in St. Thomas's Hospital, 27 in Bolingbroke Hospital, 21 in Belgrave Hospital, 20 in Banstead Asylum, 16 in Charing Cross Hospital, 15 in St. George's Hospital, 13 in Westminster Hospital, 12 in Guy's Hospital, and 12 in the South Western Fever Hospital. The places where these and the remaining deaths in Public Institutions outside the Borough occurred is shown on Table XII. The corrected number of deaths after adding the deaths on Table VIII., and subtracting those on Table VI. was 3,461, 1,703 of males and 1,758 of females, an increase of 141 compared with the previous year, but a decrease of 697 compared with the corrected decennial average. The corrected death-rate for the year was II'15, compared with ii.6i in 1905, 12.93 in 19°4, 12.24 in 1903, 13'43 in 1902, and 15'33 in 19°I. Table IX. shows the total number of deaths and the deathrates for each sub-district and for the whole Borough, corrected and uncorrected for deaths in Public Institutions. The death-rate for the whole of London for the year was 15'07 per 1,000, compared with 15.1 in 1905, 16.10 in 1904, 15.6 in 1903, and 17.2 in 1902. The death-rate in England and Wales in 1905 was 15.4 per 1,000, compared with 16.2 in 1905, and 16.2 in 1904; in the 76 Great Towns 15.9, compared with 17.2; and in the 142 Smaller Towns 14.5, compared with 15.6.

If a comparison is to be made with other places it is necessary to again correct the corrected rate, viz. :—11.15, for age and sex distribution. This is done by multiplying the rate by a factor obtained by dividing the standard death-rate in England and Wales, at the Census of 1901, with the standard death-rate for the Borough at the same period. This factor has been ascertained to be 1.0547, which gives a rate for this Borough for the year 1906 of 11.76 per 1,000, compared with 12.24 in 1905, 13.60 in 1904, 12.87 in 1903, and 14.oo in 1902. The following Table shows the standard death-rate, the factor for correction, the crude death-rate, the corrected deathrate, and the comparative mortality figure for London and for the 29 Boroughs, including the City of London, for the year 1906. The figures are extracted from the Quarterly Returns of the Registrar General for the year. 23 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE X. AREA. Standard Death-rate. Factor for Correction.

In the separate sub-districts of the Borough, the death-rate was highest in Tooting—13.49 per 1,000, and lowest in Streatham—9.59 per 1,000. In 1905 Wandsworth had the highest rate, viz. :—13'oo, and Streatham the lowest, viz. :—1o.o6 per 1,000. The rate in Clapham was higher by .63 per 1,000 compared with 1905, lower in Putney by .02, lower in Streatham by '47, higher in Tooting by 1 .58, and lower in Wandsworth by .92 per 1,000. The rates in this Table do not agree with the rates in Table XI., as the rates in the latter Table are calculated on the total population without deducting the population of non-parishioners in Public Institutions in the Borough. The first Chart shows the annual death-rate per 1,000 of population during each week for the whole of London, and for each fortnight for the Borough. As was the case in 1905, the death-rate in this Borough was always lower than that for all London, the only time when the rates almost approximated being in the third week in September. This was due, as in previous years, to the increase in the number of deaths in this Borough from Diarrhoea and Zymotic Enteritis. The approximation would not be so apparent if the weekly rates for London and the Borough were compared. The next Chart shows the death-rate in this Borough for each fortnight, compared with the rates in the year 1905. This shows that in January the rate was lower in the first fortnight and higher in the second, lower in February, higher in the first fortnight in March, lower in the second and higher in the third, higher in April and May, higher in the first fortnight in June and lower in the second, lower in the first fortnight in July and higher in the second, lower in August, lower in the first fortnight in September and higher in the other two fortnights, and lower in October, November, and December. Only once during the year was the rate above 15 per 1,000, while in 1905 this rate was exceeded on three occasions, and on six occasions the rate was under 10 per 1,000. The lowest rate was recorded in the first fortnight in November when it was only 25 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. eight, and the highest in the second fortnight in September when it was 16.7 per 1,000. The high rate in the third fortnight in March was due to Influenza and diseases of the lungs, and the high rate in September to deaths from Diarrhoea, Zymotic Enteritis, and Enteritis, especially among children. The four Tables which follow are inserted by order of the Local Government Board. Table I. shows the births, birth-rate, deaths, and death-rate per 1,000 for the whole Borough for the year, and the ten preceding years; the total deaths of children under one year of age is also given, and the rate per 1,000 births registered. Table II. shows the population, the number of births and deaths registered, and the number of deaths under one year of age, for the whole Borough, as well as for the various subdistricts. It also shows these for each year since 1896, and is to a large extent a complete history of the mortality of the Borough for the last ten years. Table III. shows the number of cases of infectious disease notified during the year at all ages and at certain age periods in the Borough and in the several sub-districts, and also shows the number of cases removed from each sub-district to Hospital. Table IV. is the General Mortality Table for the whole Borough, showing the number of deaths at all ages, arranged as to cause of death. This also shows the total number of deaths in each sub-district, and the number of deaths in Public Institutions in the district, both of residents and non-residents. 26 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Ages at Death. The following Table shows the percentage of deaths to total deaths at six age periods for each sub-district and for the whole Borough :— TABLE XVI. Sub-Districts. Under 1 year. 1 to 5 years. 5 to 15 years. 15 to 25 years. 25 to 65 years. 65 years and upwards Clapham 20.50 7.67 4.10 3.17 35.32 29.23 Putney 20.95 7.62 2.54 2.85 39.04 27.00 Streatham 22.11 7.59 1.76 3.30 31.91 33.33 Tooting 38.86 12.96 4.14 3.63 25.39 15.02 Wandsworth 27.58 9.40 3.56 3.74 34.53 21.19 Whole Borough 25.25 8.76 3.18 3.41 33.40 26.00 Compared with 1905 the percentage of deaths under one year to total deaths was .62 higher, this being due to the increased number of deaths of infants from diseases of the Digestive Organs; from one to five years 1.90 lower; from five to 15 years .61 lower; from 15 to 25 years .28 lower; from 25 to 65 years .5 higher; and from 65 years and upwards 1.66 higher. The increase in 1906 compared with 1905 is thus seen to have been at the extremes of life. As has been the case in former years, there is a considerable difference between the percentages in the sub-districts. Under one year Clapham had a percentage of only 20.5 and Putney of 20.95, while Wandsworth had a percentage of 27.58 and Tooting of 38.86; while at 65 years and upwards the percentage in Streatham was 33.33, and in Tooting only 15.02. These differences in rates are due to the difference in age distribution and social condition in the sub-districts, Tooting and Wandsworth containing a much larger proportion of persons under five years of age to total population, and also a larger proportion of the working classes. 32 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Infantile Mortality. The total number of deaths under one year was 874, compared with 818 in 1905, 851 in 1904, 743 in 1903, and 809 in 1902. Of these, 155 occurred in Clapham, 66 in Putney, 201 in Streatham, 150 in Tooting, and 302 in Wandsworth. The infantile mortality was 125 per 1,000 births, compared with 118 in 1905, 123 in 1904, 110 in 1903, and 126 in 1902. In the sub-districts this rate was 111 in Clapham, compared with 113 in 1905, and 122 the decennial average; 128 in Putney, compared with 109 and 129; 113 in Streatham, compared with 99 and 116; 146 in Tooting, compared with 148 and 147; and 131 in Wandsworth, compared with 128 and 140. Although the rate in 1906 was higher than in the three previous years, yet it was six per 1,000 under the decennial average in the Borough, and in each sub-district it was also lower than the decennial average. The following Table shows the number of deaths, the percentage to total deaths, the rate per 1,000 births for the year and for the three previous years for each sub-district and for the whole Borough.

Table XIX. shows the deaths in the whole Borough, and the six following Tables the deaths in each registration sub-district. From notifiable diseases five deaths occurred, two from Scarlet Fever, and three from Diphtheria; 16 from Measles, 28 from Whooping Cough, 269 from Diarrhæal diseases, 125 from Premature Birth, 173 from Congenital defects or diseases, 42 34 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. from diseases of a Tuberculous nature, 112 from Respiratory diseases, 17 from non-Tuberculous Meningitis, and 85 from all other causes. Compared with 1905 there is an increase in the number of deaths of infants from Diarrhæal diseases, Tuberculous diseases, non-Tuberculous Meningitis, and Convulsions, and a decrease in the number of deaths from infectious diseases, wasting diseases, Syphilis, diseases of the Respiratory Organs, and other causes. In all the deaths with the exception of eight, three in Clapham, one in Streatham, two in Tooting, and two in Southfield, the cause of death was certified by a medical man or by the coroner after inquest. 32.03 per cent, of the deaths occurred in the first month, compared with 34.2 per cent, in 1905; 51.7 per cent, in the first three months, compared with 52.4; and 72.6 in the first six months, compared with 71.8 per cent. The Table also shows that 298, or 33.3 per cent, of the total deaths occurred from wasting diseases, and that 214, or 71.8 per cent., occurred under one month. Of the total deaths under one month, viz. :—286, 214 or 74.8 per cent, occurred from wasting diseases. From Diarrhceal diseases only 20 deaths occurred under one month out of a total of 269. The greatest mortality from this group occurred from the second to the eighth month. 42 deaths occurred from Tuberculous diseases, compared with 34 in 1905, and from diseases of the Respiratory Organs 112, compared with 136. The increase in the number of deaths from Meningitis compared with the previous year raised a suspicion that some of these cases have been cases of Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis, but enquiry into the symptoms of some of the cases did not verify this. At no time during the year have my services been required by any medical practitioner, although a circular was sent to every practising medical man in the Borough stating that I would see any suspicious case. At the same time a copy of the circular issued by the Local Government Board was also sent. Report 0f the Medical Officer of Health. 35 TABLE XIX. (Table 5.) Borough of Wandsworth.

Compared with 1905 there has been an increase in the number of cases of Diphtheria, Puerperal Fever and Erysipelas, and a decrease of Scarlet Fever, while Enteric Fever is the same. 50 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Compared with the decennial average corrected for increase of population there has been a decrease in all the notifiable diseases with the exception of Puerperal Fever, where there has been an increase of 9.9. The total number of cases notified was 2,030 (357 in Clapham, 99 in Putney, 508 in Streatham, 369 in Tooting, and 697 in Wandsworth), compared with 2,211 in 1905, 1,540 in 1904, and 1,735 in 1903. The total number of cases notified per 1,000 persons living was 6.42, compared with 7.5 in 1905, 5.8 in 1904, and in 1903. The rates in the sub-districts were as follows:—in Clapham,. 5.36, compared with 6.2 in 1905, 4.05 in 1904, and 6.2 in 1903; Putney 3.3, compared with 3.2, 4.2 and 6.3; Streatham 5.3, compared with 5.4, 5.4 and 6.3; Tooting 10.2, compared with 10.5, 6.9 and 6.3; and Wandsworth 7.4, compared with 11.3, 8.1 and 8.6. In the County of London this rate was 7.5, compared with 7.0 in 1905, 6.0 in 1904, and 6.0 in 1903. In Public Institutions within the Borough eight cases of Erysipelas, and one of Scarlet Fever were notified from the Workhouse; 10 cases of Erysipelas from the Middlesex County Asylum; one case of Enteric Fever from the Tooting Bec Asylum; three cases of Erysipelas from the Tooting Home; four cases of Scarlet Fever, three of Diphtheria and one of Erysipelas from the Fountain Fever Hospital; 19 cases of Scarlet Fever, 15 of Diphtheria, one of Enteric Fever, and one of Erysipelas from the Grove Fever Hospital; 12 cases of Enteric Fever, two of Scarlet Fever, and two of Erysipelas from the Prison; and four cases of Scarlet Fever and one of Diphtheria from the Home for Feeble Minded Children; a total of 88, compared with 94 in 1905, 69 in 1904, and 70 in 1903. In Public Institutions outside the Borough there were notified during the year among persons belonging to this Borough 28 cases of Erysipelas, three of Scarlet Fever, four.of Enteric Fever, and one of Puerperal Fever from the Union Infirmary; three cases of Scarlet Fever, and two of Diphtheria from Clapham Maternity; one case of Diphtheria and one of Erysipelas from St. George's 51 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Vaccination. Table XXXI. is taken from the official returns of the Vaccination Officers to the Board of Guardians for the year 1905. It shows the number of children successfully vaccinated for the whole Borough, as well as for the separate sub-districts. Streatham, Balham and Tooting are included under the heading of Streatham.

During the year 1905, of 6,893 children whose births were registered, 5,145 or 74.6 per cent. were successfully vaccinated, compared with 73.5 per cent. in 1904, 73.7 per cent. in 1903, and 72.4 per cent. in 1902. This is the highest percentage that has been recorded since 1894, when it was 75.8. The next Table shows the percentage of children vaccinated to total births registered in the Borough and for the vaccination sub-district for the year 1905, as well as for the 10 years preceding; the average for the 10 years is also shown. The increase in the Borough of successfully vaccinated, compared with the decennial average is 4.9. In Clapham the increase was 7.7, in Putney 14.6, in Streatham 4.4, and in Wandsworth 3.0. Compared with 1904 there has been a very decided improvement in the number of cases of successful vaccinations in Clapham, but, as was the case in that year also, the number of children remaining on the books as unvaccinated was highest in Clapham, being 170, compared with none in Putney, 18 in Streatham, and 25 in Wandsworth. Putney shows an improvement compared with 1904, as also does Wandsworth and Streatham, but in the latter sub-district the improvement is only .5 per cent. In the Local Government Board's returns for the year 1903, of the children whose births were registered in England and Wales, 75.3 per cent. are recorded as successfully vaccinated, 9.7 per cent. as having died unvaccinated, while 10.7 per cent. were not finally accounted for as regards vaccination at the time the returns were made. In London the cases not finally accounted for amounted to 20.7 per cent., compared with 21.3 per cent. in the previous year. This high percentage is due largely to default in several Unions in the East End. 580 infants died unvaccinated, a percentage of 8 4, compared with 8.6 in 1904, and 8.3 in 1903. 53 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the remaining 1,168 infants, 19 or .27 per cent. were stated to have been insusceptible to vaccination, 140 or 2'o per cent, in respect to whom certificates of conscientious objection were received, 265 or 3.8 per cent. had the vaccination postponed by medical certificate, leaving 531 or 77 per cent. as removed, not to be traced, or otherwise unaccounted for, while 213 or 3.1 per cent. remained on the books as unvaccinated, compared with 5.4 remaining as unvaccinated in 1904. If the number of deaths of infants who died unvaccinated be deducted from the total births, then of the 6,313 remaining infants 81.5 per cent. were successfully vaccinated, compared with 80.5 in 1904, and 80.4 in 1903; .3 were insusceptible of vaccination, compared with .48 in 1904, and .5 in 1903; 4.2 per cent. were under medical certificate of postponement, compared with 3.4 in 1904, and 3 in 1903; and 2.2 per cent. in regard to whom certificates of conscientious objection had been obtained, compared with 2.1 in 1904, and 1.6 in 1903; leaving 11.8 per cent. unaccounted for as regards vaccination, compared with 13.1 in 1904, and 14.3 in 1903. On the whole the returns for 1905 compare most favourably with previous years. TABLE XXXII.

Scarlet Fever. 1,069 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified during the year, compared with 1,494 in 1905, 744 in 1904, and 822 in 1903. 180 of these were in Clapham, 34 in Putney, 255 in Streatham, 245 in Tooting, and 355 in Wandsworth. 895 or 83.8 per cent. of the cases were removed to hospital where 16 died, and 174 or i6.2 per cent. were treated at home with three deaths. The total number of deaths was 19, of which six were in Clapham, none in Putney, three in Streatham, three in Tooting, and seven in Wandsworth. The percentage of cases removed to Hospital shows a slight decrease compared with 1905, the percentage in that year being 84.1, but it is an increase on previous years, as in 1904 the percentage was 81.6; in 1903, 78.1; in 1902, 75; and in 1901, 70.6. The case mortality during the year was 178 per cent., compared with 1.87 in 1905, 1.74 in 1904, and 2.19 in 1903. The mortality among the cases sent to the Fever Hospitals was 1.79 per cent., compared with 2.14 in 1905, and among those treated at home 172 per cent., compared with .42 in 1905. The mortality in both these groups did not differ much in 1906, while in 1905 the percentage of deaths in hospital-treated cases was five times greater than among those treated at home. 55 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was 3.4, compared with 5.1 in 1905, 2.8o in 1904, and 3.2 in 1903, and in the County of London 4.3, compared with 4.1, 2.89, and 2.7. The proportion of cases notified was thus .9 per 1,000 lower than that for the whole of London, while in 1905 it was one per 1,000 higher. In the separate sub-districts the annual rate of notified cases per 1,000 persons living was as follows for the year, and for the three previous years:— TABLE XXXIII. Sub-Districts. 1903 1904 1905 1906 Clapham 2.4 1.8 4.1 2.7 Putney 3.8 3.0 1.8 1.1 Streatham 2.3 2.6 3.2 2.6 Tooting 3.0 3.1 7.0 7.9 Wandsworth 4.1 3.2 8.2 3.7 Whole Borough 3.2 2.8 5.1 3.4 The rate in Clapham, Putney, Streatham, and Wandsworth, is lower than in 1905, but in Tooting it is higher. In Clapham the disease was most prevalent in January, February and May, while it was at its minimum in September. There was nothing special in the incidence of this disease in Clapham during the year, with the exception of eight cases in August which were caused by an unrecognised case. In Putney the number of cases was considerably under the average, no cases having been notified in the months of February, July, August, and September. The maximum number of cases, viz:—eight, was notified in December, and 20 out of the 34 notified during the year occurred in October, November and December. No death occurred among these 34 cases. 56 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In Streatham the number of cases was slightly under the number for 1905. The maximum number of cases was notified in February and the minimum in May. The increase in February was to some extent due to the occurrence of 12 cases in one house in Balham caused by an unrecognised case. Eight of these cases were returned from hospital as not having had Scarlet Fever after being kept under observation for several days. The only other outbreak of any consequence was in Streatham, where 12 cases were notified from a tenement house of nine rooms occupied by four families. These cases were notified in September, November, and December, but the first case in September was probably infected by a previous case next door notified at the end of August. The first symptoms appeared on the30th August, but it was not notified until the 3rd September, and in the meantime other seven cases had been infected. The second group of four cases were in all probability due to one of the first group of cases returned from hospital on the 10th November. All the cases were mild and no deaths occurred. There was great carelessness on the part of the occupiers of the house in exposing themselves and their children to infection, although repeatedly warned of the danger that was incurred by so doing and by not seeking medical advice earlier. In Tooting the rate was very high, being 7.9 or .9 above the rate in 1905. The cases in Tooting were not confined to any special locality, but occurred over the whole area of the subdistrict. The maximum number of cases, viz., 29, were notified in the month of June and the minimum in December, viz., 13. Deducting the 21 cases notified from the Fountain and Grove Fever Hospitals, the rate would be 7'8. One reason of the greater number of cases in Tooting is that the number of children at school age in that sub-district is greater compared with the total population than it is in any other part of the Borough, and it is among children at school age that Scarlet Fever most frequently occurs. 57 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. At the Census of 1901, the percentage of children from four to 13 years in the whole Borough was 18.9, while in Tooting this percentage is approximately 22.1. I have not been able to trace any connection between the Fever Hospitals and the increased prevalence of Scarlet Fever in this sub-district, as, with the exception of one street, the locality in the immediate neighbourhood of these hospitals did not suffer any more severely than any other part of the sub-district. This exception was due, not to the Fever Hospitals, but to two unrecognised cases which were allowed to mix with other children in the street before the disease was recognised. There was, however, a localised outbreak in another street due to unrecognised cases. In this, 12 cases occurred in six households, five in one house, three in another, and one each in four houses. The increased prevalence in Tooting did not lead to an increased mortality, as only two deaths occurred out of the 245 cases notified. In Wandsworth the percentage of cases notified to total population was only 3.7, compared with 8.2 in 1905. The disease was not nearly so prevalent in this sub-district as was the case in 1905. The maximum number of cases was notified in February and the minimum in March. There was a slight recrudescence of this disease in the Royal Patriotic Asylum in February, when 16 cases were notified, and in March, when seven cases were notified. In 1905, 51 cases were notified, chiefly in October, and in 1906, 24 cases, the last case having been notified on the 26th March. All these were removed to hospital, but no deaths resulted. The following Table shows the number of cases notified in each sub-district during the year 1906. 58 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XXXIV. SubDistricts. January. February. March.

The Chart shows that there was only one week during the year when the number of notifications exceeded 30, that being the week ending the 3rd March. This was due to the number of cases in one house in Balham, previously mentioned in this Report. The smallest number of notifications was received in the first week of July, when only nine cases were notified. Of the total number of cases notified, viz.:—1,069, eight or .7 per cent., were under one year, compared with 12 or .8 per cent. in 1905, 264 or 24 per cent. from one to five years, compared with 357 or 23.9 per cent., 621 or 59 per cent. from five to 15 years, compared with 937 or 62.7, 127 or 17.7 per cent. from 15 to 25 years, compared with 129 or 8.6 per cent., and 49 or 4.6 per cent. from 25 to 65 years, compared with 59 or 4.0 per cent. Compared with 1905 there has been a decided decrease in the percentage at school age, from five to 15 years, and an increase at all ages above 15 years. 59 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Diphtheria. The number of cases of Diphtheria notified during the year shows a decided increase compared with 1905, and is also above the average number for the last 10 years. The following Table shows the number of cases notified, and the number of deaths that occurred in the separate sub-districts and in the whole Borough for the years 1896-1905 inclusive, the average for the 10 years, and the number of cases and deaths in 1906. 6o Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The number of cases notified was 566, 106 in Clapham, 35 in Putney, 165 in Streatham, 78 in Tooting, and 182 in Wandsworth, compared with 348 in 1905, and 406 in 1904. This number, although 65 above the uncorrected, is 110 under the corrected decennial average. In Clapham there has been an increase of 41, in Putney of 18, In Streatham of 44, in Tooting of 37, and in Wandsworth of 78. The largest number of cases occurred in Wandsworth and the smallest in Putney. The number of cases notified per 1,000 of population was 1.79, compared with 1,21 in 1905, and in London 1,70, compared with 1,38. 439 or 77,5 Per cent, of the cases were removed to hospital where 40 died, and 127 or 22,5 per cent, were treated at home with 10 deaths. The case mortality was 8 9 per cent., compared with 8.9 in 1905, and 10.8 in 1904. The case mortality for the whole of London was 8'7 per cent., compared with 8 5 in 1905, and 10 in 1904. The case mortality among the cases treated in hospital was 91 per cent., and among those treated at home 7'8 per cent. In 1905 these percentages were respectively 7.9 and 12.5, but this year a considerable number of the cases sent to hospital were in a moribund condition on admission. The following Table shows the number of cases, the caserate per 1,000 living for the year and for the 10 previous years, the number of deaths, and the death-rate for the Borough as well as for the separate sub-districts. 62 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The rate in Clapham was .59 above last year, but .5 under the decennial average, and the case-rate in all the other sub-districts also shows an increase compared with the previous year, but are all under the decennial average. Compared with London as a whole the case-rate is the same, but the death-rate is '01 per 1,000 higher. The death-rate in 1906 was .16 (.13 in Clapham, .17 in Putney, .13 in Streatham, .19 in Tooting, and .18 in Wandsworth). The rate was highest in Tooting and lowest in Clapham and Streatham. In 1905 the death-rate was only .11 per 1,000, and in the whole of London .15 in 1906, and .12 in 1905.

The death-rate for the Borough was .07 under the decennial average. All the sub-districts show a decrease, with the exception of Tooting, which is the same as such average. The Chart shows the number of cases notified during each week of the year. The maximum number of cases was notified in the second week of February, when 24 cases occurred, and there was another maximum in the first week of November. The increase in February was general all over the district, but in the end of the year, during the months of October, November and December, while the disease was more prevalent, it was most so in Balham, Tooting and Wandsworth. The smallest number of notifications was received in the first two weeks of September, when only four cases occurred, two in each week. Only one special outbreak occurred during the year, viz.:— in Brandlehow Road School; but in one Institution in the Borough, viz.:—the Hambro Orphanage, Roehampton, considerable difficulty was experienced in getting the disease eradicated. Only seven cases were notified, but the cases occurred at irregular intervals, pointing, in my opinion, to the fact that unrecognised cases existed. The first case was notified on the 5th February, followed by another on the 27th March, then other cases occurred on the 29th March, 11th and 25th April, 4th May, and 12th June. On the 23rd May, 23 swabs were taken, but no Klebs Loeffler bacilli were found. In 14 Hoffman's pseudo Diphtheria bacilli were found to be present, while in 11 a negative result was obtained. On the 1st June, 14 swabs were taken, and in one the Klebs Loeffler bacillus was found, in seven the Hoffman's bacillus, and in six there was no result. On the nth June, 11 swabs were taken, and in one both the Klebs Loeffler and the Hoffman's bacilli were found, in three the Hoffman's bacillus was found, and in seven the result was negative. 64 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. On the 23rd June, the three in whom the Hoffman's bacillus was found were again swabbed, and in two the Hoffman's bacillus was still present, while in the other the result was negative. On the 3rd April I made personal inquiries at the Institution, and I came to the conclusion that the first case had been caused by a child who had been admitted at the end of January from the country, and that the other cases were due to secondary infection. I advised the medical attendant to swab the throats of all the inmates, but this was not done thoroughly until the 23rd May. The cases were all removed to hospital and the premises were thoroughly disinfected, the children having been sent away for a time, and after their return no further cases occurred. On the 1st October a case was notified to me from No. 66, St. Ann's Hill, Wandsworth, a home for boys of defective intellect belonging to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and under the special circumstances I advised the medical attendant to at once swab the throats of the inmates. This was done on the 4th October, with the result that of 19 swabs taken, in one the Klebs Loeffler bacillus was found, in seven the Hoffman's bacillus, and in 11 no bacilli were found. On the 4th October a second case and on the 5th a third case were notified, the fourth case on the 8th, and the fifth case on the 9th. On the 8th, 16 swabs were taken, in one of which the Klebs Loeffler bacillus was found, in three the Hoffman's bacillus, and 12 were negative. 14 swabs were taken on the 24th October, but no Klebs Loeffler bacilli were found in any of the specimens, although in six the Hoffman's bacillus was present. The cases which showed the presence of the Hoffman's bacillus were treated and kept under observation for some time, but no further cases of true Diphtheria occurred. The following Table shows the number of cases of Diphtheria and their relationship to the schools in the Borough. 66 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XXXVII. SCHOOLS. January. February.

Of these 531 cases, 225 or 42.3 per cent. were not in attendance at any school, compared with 47 per cent. in 1905, while 306 or 57.7 per cent. were at school, compared with 52.6 in 1905. 48 cases occurred in connection with private schools, a considerable increase compared with last year, and 16 attended schools outside the Borough. With the exception of Brandlehow Road School, Wandsworth, where seven cases occurred in January, six in February and 18 during the year, there were no schools where exceptional increase was noted. The following special report on this outbreak was made on the 8th February:— "I have to report the occurrence of an outbreak of Diphtheria in connection with Brandlehow Road School, Wandsworth. 67 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "The first case was notified to me on the 17th January, and was removed to hospital on the 18th. This child, B. H., residing in Fawe Park Road, Wandsworth, was a scholar in Room D, Infants' Department, Brandlehow Road School. The first symptoms of the disease appeared on the 15th January, and there had been no previous illness among the other members of this family. The usual disinfection was carried out by the staff and no further cases have occurred in this household. "The second case was notified on the 22nd, the patient, A. P., a boy aged 6, was also a scholar in Room D, Infants' Department. "I made enquiries and ascertained that these children attended the same department. I at once communicated with the Medical Officer of Health, Education Department, London County Council, and advised that the throats of the children in this department should be examined and swabs taken if necessary, as I was under the impression that an unrecognised case or cases was the cause of the outbreak. The Assistant to the Medical Officer, Education Department, visited the school on the 24th and took 48 cultures, and on the 25th he reported to me that two children gave a growth of Diphtheria bacilli and eight Hoffman's, or the pseudo Diphtheria bacillus. "All these children were excluded from school, and the Head Mistress was instructed by the Medical Officer to notify all cases of sore throat to me. "The school was ordered by the Medical Officer, Education Department, to be closed on the 24th till the 29th, but I informed him that it would be necessary to keep it closed for another week so that my enquiries could be completed, and that the disinfection might be efficiently performed. "The names and addresses of the 10 children reported on by the Assistant Medical Officer were noted and information was sent to the parents of these children advising them to call in their medical attendant. 68 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "On the 25th another notification was received, the patient, a boy of four years, attending the same school. "The two cases in which the true bacillus had been isolated were notified by the Medical Officer, Education Department, and another case was notified on the 29th January. The total number of cases that have occurred in connection with this department was seven, but in addition five other cases occurred in the immediate neighbourhood, one of these attending another school, and other four relations of one of the children notified. "Cultures were taken from the throats of 10 patients in the neighbourhood, and in five, four of which were members of the same family, the bacillus associated with Diphtheria was found, in three Hoffman's pseudo Diphtheria bacillus was present, and in two the bacillus was not found. One of the cases where the Hoffman's bacillus was present had been examined by the Assistant Medical Officer, Education Department, and at that time the true Diphtheria bacillus was found. "An enquiry into the history of the dates of the first symptoms elicited the fact that a girl of seven years attending the school and residing in Fawe Park Road had had a sore throat about the 10th January and continued at school. The throat of this child was swabbed and the Diphtheria bacillus was found. "The two cases first notified proved fatal. "A review of the whole of the circumstances in connection with this outbreak only emphasizes the fact which has been previously noted, that carrier cases, or cases attending school with the Diphtheria bacillus present with very few clinical symptoms, invariably cause a serious outbreak of the disease, more especially if the carrier case or cases attend infants' departments of public schools. "One feature of this outbreak which has also been previously observed is the association of the true bacillus and Hoffman's bacillus. All the facts which have been observed 69 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. in this outbreak appear to point to a distinct relationship between these two bacilli, either that they are of the same species, or that the Hoffman bacillus renders the affected individual more liable to infection by the true bacillus. "Enquiries as to the condition of the school premises elicited the fact that the whole of the basement of the school had been flooded with sewage on the 24th November, 1904. This sewage was due to the accidental stopping of the main sewer in Brandlehow Road. The whole of the basement was cleared of sewage on the 28th November. It is quite possible that the presence of this sewage in the basement gave rise to a condition of the throats of the children in the Infants' department which would render them liable to infection by a specific germ, and it seems as if the children in this department had been infected by the Hoffman bacillus first, and secondly by the true Diphtheria bacillus. That sore throat would occur among children attending the Infants' department is what one would have anticipated, as this department is situated immediately above the cellar, and the smell from this cellar would easily permeate into the whole of the Infants' department. "The outbreak is now, in my opinion, quite at an end as far as the school is concerned. The whole of the Infants' department was thoroughly disinfected and cleansed." Of the total number of cases of Diphtheria, 182 or 32.5 per cent. occurred among children under five years of age, 304 or 54.2 per cent. from five to 15 years, and 75 or 13.3 per cent. over 15 years. Of the 439 cases removed to hospital, 30 were reported to be not suffering from Diphtheria. Drainage defects were found in 71 of the houses in which cases of Diphtheria occurred. Return Cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. 24 cases of Scarlet Fever occurred after the return of cases from the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, compared with 51 in 1905, 17 in 1904, and 50 in 1903. e 70 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. There were also three return cases of Diphtheria, compared with none in 1905, none in 1904, and 11 in 1903. Two of the cases of Scarlet Fever were in Clapham, none in Putney, nine in Streatham, nine in Tooting, and four in Wandsworth. The three return cases of Diphtheria were in Putney. Four of the cases of Scarlet Fever occurred in one family,, three in another, and two each in two families. The three cases of Diphtheria occurred in the same family. The following Table shows the date of removal to hospital of the first case, the date of return from hospital, the number of days the first case was in hospital, the date of the first symptoms of the subsequent case, and the number of days elapsing between the return of the first case and the first symptoms of the subsequent case or cases. The average number of days the cases of Scarlet Fever were in hospital was 59, while in the case of Diphtheria the infecting case had been isolated for 95 days. 71 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The total number of deaths was 15, six in Clapham, two in Putney, two in Streatham, none in Tooting, and five in Wandsworth, compared with 11 in 1905, 11 in 1904, and 19 in 1903. The number of deaths, although four more than in 1905, was nine under the corrected decennial average. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was .30, compared with .33 in 1905, .27 in 1904, and .41 in 1903, and with .34 for the whole of London. The corrected death-rate from fever was '048 per 1,000, compared with .04 in 1905, .04 in 1904, and .07 in 1903; while the rate for the whole of London was .05, compared with .05 in 1905, .06 in 1904, and .08 in 1903. Chart showing the number of cases of Enteric Fever notified during each week of the year 1906. 73 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The death-rate in the separate sub-districts was as follows:— in Clapham .08, in Putney .06, in Streatham .02, and in Wandsworth .05 per 1,000. Of the 53 cases removed to hospital 16 were found not to be. suffering from Enteric Fever. The Chart shows the number of cases notified in each week during the year. Of the 96 cases notified, 16 were not Enteric Fever, and 13 cases occurred in H.M. Prison, where a special enquiry was made by Government officials, leaving 67 cases of Enteric, regarding which special enquiry was made as to the probable cause of infection. In 15 of the cases the infection was probably due to eating shell-fish, in seven to watercress, in nine the disease was contracted outside the Borough (one in Egypt, one in Austria, and seven in other places), while six were infected by previous cases. With regard to the cases probably infected by eating shellfish, six were from oysters, one from mussels, one from cockles and seven from winkles. Four of the cases from eating shell-fish, two from oysters and two from winkles, were fatal. The following are the particulars of the 15 cases probably due to shell-fish :— (1.) S. L., notified on the 19th March. Had oysters about a fortnight previous to first symptoms from a local dealer. (2.) H. B., notified on the 8th October. Had oysters at Ramsgate about the end of August, and the first symptoms appeared about the 14th September. This patient was a habitual eater of oysters and cockles, and besides partaking of oysters at Ramsgate had several lots of cockles from Southend. This case proved fatal. (3.) F. W., notified on the 2nd November. Had oysters at Bognor a fortnight previous to appearance of first symptems. This case also proved fatal. 74 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (4.) K. A., notified on the 9th November. Had oysters on the 10th October purchased from local dealers, and the first symptoms appeared about the 27th October. (5.) A. H., notified on the 22nd November. Had oysters at a shop in town on several occasions before appearance of first symptoms. (6.) H. S., notified on the 26th November. Patient had oysters about the 1st November, and the first symptoms appeared on the 19th November. The oysters were purchased at a shop in the city. (7.) T. W., notified on the 8th September. Had cockles at Heme Bay on several occasions up to the 19th August there, and the first symptoms appeared on the 29th August. (8.) H. O., notified on the 12th October. Had winkles at Newquay where he was on holiday about a fortnight previous to the appearance of the first symptoms. The Medical Officer of Health of that district was communicated with, but he reported that he did not think that the case could have 0fen infected there as the drainage outfall is a considerable distance from the mussel-bearing beds, and he did not think that there were any shell-fish near the sewer outlet. The patient stated that he picked the winkles from the rocks, but only ate a few as he noticed that they had a peculiar taste. (9-15.) These seven cases were all caused by eating winkles, and were the subject of a special report. ENTERIC FEVER AND SHELL-FISH. For some years I have, in my Annual Reports, called attention to cases of Enteric Fever caused by the eating of shell-fish. In any case where the vendor of the shell-fish could be found, the name of the wholesale dealer was ascertained, and this information was sent to the Medical Officer of Health for the City of London, in whose district Billingsgate is situated. In many of 75 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. the cases action was taken by the City Authorities and as a result the sale of polluted shell-fish from certain localities was stopped. This year 1 have again to report the occurrence of several cases of Enteric Fever caused by shell-fish, but in these cases the shell-fish was sent from a remote part of Scotland, and what is more serious from a public health point of view, from a part where polluted shell-fish was known to exist, as attention had been called to the locality by an outbreak of Enteric Fever in Glasgow in 1903, when the shell-fish were gathered on the same spot. In the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the County of Argyll for 1903, Dr. McNeill, the Medical Officer of Health, states that 27 cases of Enteric Fever had been notified between the 18th and the 24th August, all the patients having eaten shell-fish gathered on the shore of Loch Gilp, a small loch in Argyllshire, into which the sewage of the Burgh of Lochgilphead, the Argyll and Bute Asylum, the Poorhouse, and a number of private houses is discharged without treatment. Dr. McNeill states that at low tide the sea recedes about one mile from the head of the loch, and that the foreshore teems with shell-fish. Specimens of these shell-fish were taken and examined bacteriologically and it was found that those collected nearest the sewer showed the existence of a virulent bacillus of excremental origin (bacillus coli), and that in those gathered at a distance the bacillus was absent. It was also found that the bacillus typhosus, the bacillus of Typhoid Fever, was present in these surface cockles, and in one cockle it was obtained almost in pure culture. Dr. McNeill was of opinion that it was doubtful if the Local Authority could prohibit the gathering of shell-fish from polluted areas, but urged on Local Authorities the necessity of preventing the pollution of the foreshore where shell-fish are gathered with crude sewage. Although the number of cases in this Borough caused by eating shell-fish was few, there is little doubt that they were due to shell-fish collected in this area. 76 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The first case was notified on the 3rd February, one on the 2nd March, one on the 9th April, one on the 17th April, one on the 19th April, one on the 23rd April, and one on the 24th April, a total of seven, two of which proved fatal. Four of these occurred in the same house. It was not until the second case was notified that attention was directed to shell-fish as the cause of the disease as no information could be obtained in regard to the case notified on the 3rd February. The information was to the effect that the patients in every case partook of winkles bought from a local dealer who in turn bought them from a salesman in Billingsgate market. As soon as I was aware that the winkles had been bought at Billingsgate, I (on March 26th) communicated with the Medical Officer of Health for the City of London, who replied on the 3rd April to the effect that samples had been taken from the dealer and examined by Dr. Klein who reported that they did not show general pollution, nor did they contain the microbes searched for. On the 10th April I again wrote Dr. Collingridge informing him that another case had been notified and asking for information regarding the source of the cockles, to which he replied on the nth April that the winkles came from the West Coast of Scotland, and were collected from Oban, Skye, and Loch Fyne. As soon as I was aware that the winkles had come from Loch Fyne, or its neighbourhood, I communicated with Dr. McNeill, the Medical Officer of Health to the County of Argyll, who informed me that in August and September, 1903, an outbreak of Enteric Fever, due to the consumption of shell-fish, occurred in Glasgow, and that the shell-fish had been gathered in Loch Gilp Head. On the 8th May I received another letter from Dr. McNeill in which he stated that the polluted area had been under observation and that shell-fish from this area had been forwarded to several dealers at Billingsgate. Copies of the correspondence were sent to the Medical Officer of Health for the City of London and he reported the facts to his Sanitary Committee in May, 1906, and also that he was in 77 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. munication with the Medical Officer of Health for the County of Argyll with a view of ascertaining whether the water was sewage polluted at a number of other places in the neighbourhood of Loch Gilp Head, from which he was informed fishermen gather fish consigned to Billingsgate. This outbreak once more shows the necessity of further legislation being necessary for the purpose of giving powers to Local Authorities to inspect shefl-fish layings and to prohibit the sale of shell-fish from polluted layings or beds. In seven of the cases, one of which proved fatal, the patient had partaken of watercress previous to the appearance of the first symptoms, and in all the cases the watercress was purchased from itinerant dealers whose identity was difficult to establish. In six of the cases the infection was traced to a previous case in the same house; all of these cases recovered; while of the nine cases where the disease was contracted outside the Borough, one was fatal. In every case the drains of the houses were tested, but in only four was any result obtained, while in all the other cases the sanitary conditions were satisfactory. Cases of Mistaken Diagnosis. In 93 cases (47 of Scarlet Fever, 30 of Diphtheria, and 16 of Enteric Fever), information was received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board that the patients were not suffering from the disease notified or any other notifiable disease, compared with 97 in 1905, 94 in 1904, and 106 in 1903. Of the 1,386 cases of these diseases removed to hospital the diagnosis in 93, or 6.7 per cent., was incorrect, compared with 5.2 per cent. in 1905, 10 in 1904, and 9.5 in 1903. Enteric Fever is responsible for the highest percentage, viz., 30.1, and Scarlet Fever the lowest, viz , 5.2. 78 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. There has been a very satisfactory decrease in the percentage of cases of mistaken diagnosis in Diphtheria, this having fallen from i8'i in 1904 and 11.9 in 1905 to 68 in 1906. This is no doubt due to the greater care taken by medical practitioners in diagnosis by having a bacteriological examination made before certifying that the patient is suffering from this disease. The following Table shows the number of cases of mistaken diagnosis from these three diseases in the several sub-districts, and for the whole Borough, as well as the percentage of error. TABLE XXXIX.

There has also been a very decided increase in the number of cases examined in Clapham and Streatham, but in Tooting the increase has only been slight. In 106 out of the 363 examinations made for the bacillus of Diphtheria the result was positive, and in 19 out of the 44 examinations of blood in suspected cases of Enteric Fever the Widal reaction was obtained. Puerperal Fever. 25 cases of Puerperal Fever were notified, compared with 18 an 1905, 14 in 1904, and 13 in 1903. Five of the cases occurred in Clapham, four in Putney, four in Streatham, two in Tooting, and 10 in Wandsworth. 80 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Eleven of the cases (four in Clapham, three in Putney, one in Streatham, and three in Wandsworth), or 44 per cent. were fatal, compared with 44.4 per cent. in 1905, and 35.7 per cent. in 1904. Five of the cases were removed to the Union Infirmary, and four of these proved fatal. The death-rate was .035 per 1,000, compared with .028 in 1905, and .013 in 1904. The case-rate per 1,000 births was 3"5, while for the whole of London this rate was 2'4- During the year a copy of the following Regulations, which had been drawn up by the Society of Medical Officers of Health, was handed to every nurse who had been in attendance on a case of Puerperal Fever, and in all the cases the necessary disinfection was carried out. Seven nurses had free baths at the Disinfecting Station, Tooting. After disinfection and cleansing the appended certificate isgiven to the nurse. REGULATIONS for the Disinfection of Midwives after Attendance upon Patients Suffering from Puerperal Fever. Personal Disinfection. The midwife, after attending a septic case, should take a complete bath, including the thorough washing of the hair. An order for a free bath can be obtained from any of the Sanitary Inspectors or on application at the Public Health Department, 90, East Hill, Wandsworth. Disinfection of hands.—The careful disinfection of the hands requires strict attention. The nails should be trimmed. The hands should be washed with soap and water, rinsed in clean water, soaked in methylated spirit, and finally soaked in a solution of corrosive sublimate (1 in 1,000) or other equally efficient disinfectant, for about 10 minutes. 81 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Disinfection of Clothing. All articles of clothing worn while attending a septic case should be changed for entirely fresh ones, the used clothing being handed over to the Sanitary Authority for disinfection. Disinfection of Apparatus. The bag and apparatus used by the midwife should be handed over to the Sanitary Authority for disinfection. It is considered advisable that gum elastic catheters and syringes should be destroyed. Metal and other articles which will not be injured by the process should be boiled. The lining of the bag should be removed and destroyed, while the bag itself should be washed with corrosive sublimate (1 in 1,000) or other equally efficient disinfectant. Form of Certificate. I hereby Certify that................., who has recently been in attendance upon a patient suffering from "Puerperal Fever," has undergone personal cleansing and disinfection, and that her clothing, instruments, and other apparatus have been disinfected by the Sanitary Authority to my satisfaction. P. CALDWELL SMITH, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. Erysipelas. 273 cases of this disease were notified and 10 deaths occurred. 53 of the cases and one death occurred in Clapham, 18 cases and one death in Putney, 65 cases and one death in Streatham, 35 cases and two deaths in Tooting, and 102 cases and five deaths in Wandsworth. 59 of the cases were removed to the Union Infirmary where six deaths occurred. In 1905 the number of cases notified was 253 and the number of deaths 14. 82 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Measles. The total number of deaths from the above disease was 65, 26 of males and 39 of females, compared with 89 in 1905, and 104 in 1904. 14 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, five in Putney, 18 in Streatham, nine in Tooting, and 19 in Wandsworth. The number of deaths is 24 less than in 1905, and is 55.6 under the corrected decennial average. 16 of the deaths were of infants under one year, 45 from one to five years, three from five to 15 years, and one from 25 to 65 years. The death-rate was .21 per 1,000, compared with .31 in 1905, .38 in 1904, and .43 in 1903. The death-rate for the whole of London was .40, compared with .36 in 1905; for England and Wales .27; and for the 76 Great Towns .40 per 1,000. During the year 1,271 visits were made by the Sanitary Inspectors in cases of Measles, 221 in Clapham, 82 in Putney, 360 in Streatham, 158 in Tooting, and 450 in Wandsworth. The next Table shows the number of premises disinfected after Measles in each sub-district for each month of the year. The total number of premises disinfected was 902, 149 in Clapham, 55 in Putney, 263 in Streatham, 128 in Tooting, and 307 in Wandsworth, compared with 798 in 1905, and 1,115 in 1904. The greatest number of disinfections was carried out in January due to a slight outbreak in Tooting. In June and July there was a slight increase owing to cases in Wandsworth in June and in Streatham in July. In the last four months of the year the number of disinfections was small as there were very few cases of the disease in any part of the Borough. 83 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Table XLII. shows the number of cases of Measles and other non-notifiable diseases notified by the teachers in the public elementary schools in the Borough. In all 3,810 cases were notified, compared with 3,352 in 1905, and 2,291 in 1904. 1,453 of these were cases of Measles, 634 of Chicken-pox, 549 of Whooping Cough, 806 of Mumps, and 368 of Ringworm. There was an increase in the number of cases of Measles notified as also of Chicken-pox, Mumps and Ringworm, but a slight decrease in the number of cases of Whooping Cough. With regard to Measles, 336 were notified from schools in Clapham, 92 in Putney, 396 in Streatham, 99 in Tooting, and 530 in Wandsworth. 84 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XLII.

F 86 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The death-rate was .17 per 1,000, compared with .26 in 1905 and '26 for the whole of London. From Measles and Whooping Cough the greatest number of deaths occur under five years of age. Out of a total of 120 deaths 115 or 95.8 per cent. occurred among children under five years of age. The number of cases notified from schools was 549, compared with 576 in 1905, and 163 in 1904. Epidemic Influenza. 70 deaths were caused by Influenza, 34 of males and 36 of females, an increase of 29 compared with 1905, but a decrease of 16.5 compared with the corrected decennial average. 14 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, nine in Putney, 27 in Streatham, five in Tooting, and 15 in Wandsworth. The death-rate was .22 per 1,000, compared with .14 in 1905, and .22 in 1904. 31 of these deaths were of persons from 25 to 65, and 30 of persons over 65 years of age. From enquiries made among a number of medical men practising in the Borough I have ascertained that a considerable proportion of cases of Influenza occurring in the Borough in the latter part of the year were of a different type to those of previous years as gastro-enteric symptoms were prominent. The greatest number of deaths, however, occurred from diseases of the respiratory organs subsequent to Influenza, only one death having been registered as being due to abdominal Influenza. Diarrhoea. 218 deaths, 109 of males and 109 of females, occurred from Diarrhoea and Zymotic Enteritis during the year, compared with 137 in 1905, and 208 in 1904. There has been an increase of 81 compared with 1905, and of 12.3 compared with the corrected decennial average. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 87 31 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 16 in Putney, 38 in Streatham, 50 in Tooting, and 83 in Wandsworth. In all the sub-districts the number of deaths was greater than in 1905, but the smallest increase was in Clapham where the number only increased from 24 to 31. In Putney the number increased from two to 16, in Streatham from 22 to 38, in Tooting from 32 to 50, and in Wandsworth from 37 to 83. The death-rate was .70 per 1,000, compared with .47 in 1905, and .79 in 1904. The death-rate for the whole of London was .95, compared with .72 in 1905 and 1.03 in 1904. Although the death-rate in the district for the year does not compare favourably with the previous year, yet it does so in comparison with London, and if we examine the statistics for other large towns in England we will find that in all there was a decided increase compared with the previous year. For example the rate in Birmingham increased from .83 in 1905 to 1.56 in 1906, in Croydon from .33 to 1.35, in Leeds from .79 to .97, in Bristol from .36 to .58, in West Ham from 1.59 to 1.91, in Liverpool from 1.35 to 1.87, and in St. Helens from .95 to 1.32. The death-rate in the sub-districts was as follows:— in Clapham .46, Putney .54, Streatham .40, Tooting 1.74, and Wandsworth .91. Of the total number of deaths registered 188 or 86 per cent. were of infants under one year, compared with 87 per cent. in 1905. Including Enteritis the total number of deaths was 289, compared with 203 in 1905, and 301 in 1904. The following Table shows the number of deaths from Diarrhoea and Enteritis under one year for the four quarters of 1906, and the five previous years. 88 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In 186 of the deaths special enquiries were made and the following Table shows the methods of feeding the deceased infants. Diarrhoea.

In 118 or 66.2 per cent. of the deaths, cows' milk, either alone or with farinaceous food, was used, while in 34 or 19 per cent., condensed milk alone or with farinaceous food was used. In four cases patent foods only were used. The increased mortality during the year from Diarrhoea was largely due to climatic conditions, the temperature having been greatly in excess of the average, and the rainfall low. These climatic conditions, combined with carelessness and ignorance of the proper method of feeding, were responsible for the majority of the deaths of these infants. As regards climatic conditions the Chart shows how greatly the temperature was in excess of the mean of the past 50 years, 90 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. he number of inches of rainfall, and the deaths during each day of the three months, July, August and September. Owing to the increased number of deaths in the third quarter of the year, it was deemed advisable to submit the following special report to the Council. REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health on the Mortality from Diarrhœa during the Third Quarter of 1906. In the third quarter of the year ending the 29th September, 188 deaths occurred from Diarrhoea and Zymotic Enteritis, and 46 from simple Enteritis, a total of 234. The mortality from Diarrhoea was 2.50 per 1,000 for the whole Borough, 1.53 in Clapham, 1.92 in Putney, 1.27 in Streatham, 7 08 in Tooting, and 3.20 in Wandsworth. The mortality was thus highest in Tooting and Wandsworth. The mortality, although above the average, compares favourably with other large towns, the figures for which are available. For examples the rates in the following towns were as follows, viz.:— London 1.81 Huddersfield 2.24 Croydon 3.07 Leeds 4.45 St. Helens 4.47 Liverpool 5.45 The rate per 1,000 births was as follows in the different wards:— Clapham North 75 Clapham South 51 Putney 126 Streatham 104 Balham 75 Tooting 173 Southfield 136 Fairfield 51 Springfield 101 Whole Borough 100 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 91 In the Borough of Battersea this rate was 92, and in London as a whole 112. Of the total deaths from Diarrhoea and Enteritis, 180 were of children under one year, and special enquiry was made in each death to ascertain how the child was fed. The total number of deaths was 180, and in only six of these could no information be obtained, chiefly on account of the fact that the parents had removed from the district. In 11, or 6.1 per cent. of the deaths, the infant was nursed by the mother, whereas 91.1 per cent. were otherwise fed, the majority on cows' milk or condensed milk. 20 of the deaths were of illegitimate children and eight were nurse children who had been born in other parts of London. 48 of the infants were either prematurely born or were delicate from birth, and under normal circumstances these would probably have succumbed in the first two months of life. As regards social status of the parents (deducting the 20 illegitimate deaths), it was found that 61 were labourers, 36 artizans, 33 small tradesmen, while the other 30 were of various occupations. It is hardly possible to state exactly from these statistics whether the work which has been carried out by the Inspectors of the Council has been the means of preventing many deaths from this disease, although it may be shown by reference to the figures that such work has been beneficial. For example, in Tooting where the mortality was greatest, of the 45 deaths 17 had been previously visited by the Inspector after notification of the birth. The mortality among those visited previously was only 3.6, while among those not visited this mortality was 8'3 per cent. In Wandsworth, however, the figures do not show such satisfactory results, the mortality among those visited in Springfield Ward having been 3.9, and among those not visited 3.5 per cent. 92 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. It must be noted, however, that the visits of the Inspector are only made among the labouring classes, and that of the 397 births not visited in the Springfield Ward the great majority were among persons of a higher social condition, among whom the mortality from Diarrhoea is very small. From a careful examination of these returns I am decidedly of opinion that the work of the Inspectors has been of the very greatest benefit, and taking into consideration the great increase of population, especially of the working-class population, the mortality is lower than was expected. The meteorological conditions were this year most favourable for all intestinal diseases, and over the whole of England the mortality from these diseases has been above the average. As will be seen from the Table the Inspectors chiefly confine their work to the Tooting, Fairfield, and Springfield Wards, and I am of opinion that it would be most desirable for the Council to appoint one Health Visitor, who could, under the Sanitary Inspectors, undertake the visiting of houses after notification of births and who could devote all her time to such work. If the appointment were made it would then be possible to extend the work to the other Wards of the Borough. 93 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Springfield 3 were weakly, being severally one of twins. 2 were ill from birth. P. CALDWELL SMITH, Medical Officer of Health. 10th October, 1906. During the year the female Sanitary Inspectors have continued the work begun in 1905, in visiting homes where births occurred, and the following report gives the result of such visits and a general account of the work carried out:— "We have the honour of submitting to you our report on the work we have done amongst infants during the past year. "The visiting has been confined to the Parish of Tooting, the poorer parts of Balham, and the Fairfield and Springfield Wards of Wandsworth. Even in this circumscribed area it has been impossible to visit as frequently as would be desirable owing to the limited time at our disposal for this work. As under present circumstances only half the number of mothers can be visited a second time, it will be readily conceded that the results cannot be so satisfactory as if more frequent visits and help were given. We are glad to say that our advice has been in many instances gratefully received, and now that the work is more widely known the visits are looked forward to. "Reference to Table XLV. will show the total number of visits paid after notification of birth, the method of feeding at the first visit, and the number of infants visited who died during the year. The ineffectual visits mentioned are largely due to the shifting population in the poorer districts. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 95 In many instances the family had removed, in some cases wrong addresses had been given, and frequently we had to call two, three or even as many as six times before finding the mother at home. "Table XLVI. shows the number of infants visited a second time and the method of feeding then found, the average age at the second visit being from four to five months. "It will be seen from Table XLV. that out of the 1,626 infants visited 50 were having food in addition to the breast. "The excuse invariable was that the child 'was not satisfied' with the mother's milk, and so bread, baked flour, or, in the majority of instances, nursery biscuits, were added. At the second visit we found that 36 out of the 50 had on our advice discontinued the food; of these 13 were given the breast only and 23 were obliged to give cows' milk in addition. "During the hot weather Nestle's condensed milk was largely given in preference to cows' milk owing to the lack of cool storage room in the poorer houses; in not more than one or two instances did we find a larder with outside ventilation. Several mothers gave cows' milk during the day and condensed milk at night. Nearly all those giving cows' milk were following the directions contained in the pamphlets distributed. "In Tooting, tube bottles were more largely used than the boat shaped, in Wandsworth the reverse was the case. "As in 1905, we found that the weaning of the infants, especially during the winter months, was mainly due to the malnutrition of the mothers or to the necessity of their having to go out to work owing to the lack of employment among the men. "With regard to the employment of midwives, out of the 1,626 mothers visited 692 availed themselves of their 96 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. services. Of these, in Balham 30 were registered and 26 non-registered; in Tooting 180 were registered and 77 nonregistered; in Wandsworth 261 were registered (Fairfield 77, Springfield 184) and 118 non-registered (Fairfield 43, Springfield 75). "Great difficulty was experienced in tracing the illegitimate births; wrong addresses were frequently given, or the mothers removed as soon after the birth as possible. In all, 55 illegitimate children were visited (Balham seven, Tooting 26, Fairfield Ward four, Springfield Ward 18). Of these, seven died in Tooting and two in the Fairfield Ward of Wandsworth; 12 had removed after our first visit and we were unable to trace them. One only of the illegitimate infants was premature and five were delicate from birth. It will be seen that the majority of these children were born strong and healthy, and yet the percentage of deaths is very high. One of the probable causes of this mortality is the putting of the children out to nurse; 11 of the babies were tended by strangers, and 10 were looked after by the grandmother, in each case necessitating the exposure of the infant to the early morning and night air. "The Diarrhoea epidemic in July, August and September was exceptionally severe, and we are glad to state that out of the 1,626 infants visited by us during the year only 29 succumbed to this disease. 34 died from other causes, chiefly respiratory complaints. A number of deaths were due to prematurity; many infants had died from this cause previous to our first call, and of those whom we did visit 37 were premature and 56 were delicate from birth. "Many sanitary defects were discovered in the course of our visits; these were remedied, or if involving structural defects, referred to you. In Balham 14 intimation notices were served, in Tooting 75, in Wandsworth 99 (Southfield one, Springfield 57, Fairfield 41). One statutory notice was required in Tooting and 12 in Wandsworth (Springfield five, Fairfield seven). "We realise that we have only been able to touch the fringe of the vast problem of how to help the mothers to a Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 97 better knowledge of the right care of their children. The improvement may be slow, almost imperceptible, but we feel that steady progress is being made, and we trust that next year better results will be seen." TABLE XLV. INFANTS VISITED. Balham.

If we add to this the number of children where other foods were given in addition to the breast, we find that the percentage increases to 88. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 99 95, or 5.8 per cent. were fed on cows' milk only, but 26 had in addition other food, raising the percentage to 7.4. 31 had condensed milk only, and 13 had condensed milk and food, a total of 44, or 2.7 per cent., while nine infants were fed on farinaceous food only. With reference to the cases re-visited it was found that out of the total of 858, 555 or 64.1 per cent. were still breast fed only. The number of deaths among the infants visited by the Inspectors was 63, and of these only 29 died from Diarrhoea or Enteritis. There is no doubt that the work has been most beneficial, but it is impossible, with the present staff, to extend it to the other Wards in the Borough. Some voluntary help was obtained towards the end of the year, and this partly accounts for the increase in the number of infants visited. This help was found to be most useful, and if possible, some additional help will be obtained in the current year. The following Table shows the death-rate from Zymotic diseases for the Borough for the year as well as for the three previous years. 100 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XLVII.

For the whole Borough the rate is four above the previous year, but it is the same as the decennial average. Tubercular Diseases. The total number of deaths from this group of diseases was 376, compared with 360 in 1905, 380 in 1904, 343 in 1903, and 314 in 1902. 267 of the deaths were due to Tubercular disease of the Lungs, 49 to Tubercular disease of the Brain, and 60 to other forms of Tubercular diseases. The number of deaths from Tubercular disease of the Lungs and other Tubercular diseases and the rates per 1,000 for the whole Borough and for the separate sub-districts are shown in the next Table. The corrected death-rate for Tubercular disease of the Lungs was '86 per 1,000, compared with .93 in 1905, 1.07 in 1904, and 104 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. .91 in 1903; from other Tubercular diseases .35, compared with .33 and .36; and from all Tubercular diseases 1.21, compared with 1.26 and 1.43.

With regard to Tubercular disease of the Lungs, the rates for Putney, Tooting and Wandsworth were under, and for Clapham above last year, while in Streatham this rate was the same. The rate for other Tubercular diseases is .02 higher than in 1905, but lower than in 1904 or 1903. This rate was lowest in Streatham and highest in Tooting, and the rate for Tubercular disease of the Lungs was lowest in Streatham and highest in Wandsworth.

Among females 112 out of 125 had no occupation, while of the remaining 13, five were domestic servants, three dressmakers, two nurses, one a school teacher, and one a waitress. No deaths from this disease occurred among laundry hands, although a considerable number (about 3,200) are employed and reside in the Borough. Voluntary Notification of Consumption. During the year 74 cases of this disease were notified by medical practitioners, four from Clapham, two from Putney, four from Streatham, one from Tooting, and 63 from Wandsworth. Two of these cases were under one year, two from one to five years, four from five to 15 years, seven from 15 to 25 years, 58 from 25 to 65 years, and one over 65 years. In 10 of the cases no enquiries were made, nine were notified from the Workhouse, while of the remaining 55 which were visited by the Inspectors, 30 died during the year, 13 removed to other addresses, and eight recovered, leaving only four still under observation at the end of the year. Of the 57 cases on the Register at the end of 1905, 13 died, 20 removed to other places, 12 recovered, and in seven no enquiries were made, leaving five still on the Register. The total number on the Register and under observation at the end of 1906 was nine. In 16 of the 55 cases visited for the first time during the year, a definite history of infection by a previous case was obtained. During the year disinfection was carried out at 134 premises, either after the death or removal of the patient. 28 of the premises disinfected were in Clapham, nine in Putney, 33 in Streatham, 14 in Tooting, and 50 in Wandsworth. 109 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Bacteriological Examination of Sputum. 70 examinations of sputum were made at the Lister Institute, four from Clapham, three from Putney, 13 from Streatham, nine from Tooting, and 41 from Wandsworth. In 22 of the cases it was reported that the bacillus had been found and in 48 that it was absent. Circulatory Diseases. During the year 331 deaths occurred, 144 of which, 75 of males and 69 of females, were due to Organic disease of the Heart. 84 of these deaths occurred in Clapham, 36 in Putney, 95 in Streatham, 26 in Tooting, and 90 in Wandsworth. Of the deaths from Organic disease of the Heart, six were from five to 15 years, eight from 15 to 25 years, 83 from 25 to 65 years, and 47 over 65 years. The number of deaths from this group of diseases was 15 less than in 1905 and 95 under the corrected decennial average. Respiratory Diseases. The total number of deaths was 511, compared with 512 in 1905, 514 in 1904, 379 in 1903, and 550 in 1902. The number of deaths was one under the previous year and 121 under the corrected decennial average. 111 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 40 in Putney, 111 in Streatham, 61 in Tooting, and 182 in Wandsworth. Compared with 1905 there is a slight increase in Clapham, Putney and Wandsworth, and a slight decrease in Streatham and Tooting. 121 of the deaths occurred from Acute Bronchitis, 115 from Chronic Bronchitis, 130 from Lobar Pneumonia, 123 from Lobular or Broncho-Pneumonia, and 22 from other diseases of the Respiratory Organs. 110 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 112 of the deaths were of infants under one year, 73 of persons from one to five years, 10 from five to 15 years, nine from 15 to 25 years, 113 from 25 to 65 years, and 172 over 65 years.

In the Public Institutions in the Borough 771 deaths occurred during the year, compared with 729 in 1905, and 669 in 1904. Of these 611 deaths were of persons not belonging to the Borough, compared with 61o in 1905, and 160 of persons belonging to the Borough, compared with 119 in 1905. The increase was due almost wholly to the increase in the number of deaths of persons belonging to the Borough. In Clapham 56 deaths occurred in the Hostel of God, 10 of these being Borough residents. Of these 34 were due to Cancer, 16 to Tubercular disease of the Lungs, three from other Tubercular diseases, and three from other causes. Five deaths occurred in the Priory, Roehampton, three from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, and two from other causes. In Streatham there were 10 deaths in St. Anne's Home and nine in the Middlesex County Asylum Annexe. Of the 10 in St. Anne's Home three were from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, one from Old Age, one from Obstruction of the Bowels, one from Accidental and four from other causes. Of the nine in the Middlesex County Asylum Annexe six were from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, one from Erysipelas, one from Acute Bronchitis, and one from other causes. In Tooting 493 deaths occurred in Public Institutions, 124 of which were of persons belonging to the Borough. Of the 229 deaths in Tooting Bee Asylum 119 were from Old Age, 17 from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, 17 from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, 13 from Inflammation and Softening of the Brain, eight from Cancer, seven from Bright's disease, six from Accident, and 42 from all other causes. In the Fever Hospitals 149 deaths occurred, 55 of which belonged to the Borough, compared with 50 in 1905, and 106 in 1904. 59 of these deaths were from Scarlet Fever, 61 from 116 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. theria, 13 from Enteric Fever, one from Measles, one from Whooping Cough, and 14 from all other causes. 115 deaths occurred in the Tooting Home, 60 of which were Borough residents. 49 of these were from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, 31 from Old Age, 11 from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, eight from Organic disease of the Heart, and 16 from all other causes. In Wandsworth 105 deaths occurred in the Middlesex County Asylum, 13 in the Royal Hospital for Incurables, eight in the Prison, and eight in the Workhouse. Of the 105 in the Middlesex County Asylum, 21 were from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, 18 from Old Age, 12 from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, four from Bright's disease, three from Accident, two from Enteritis, one from Erysipelas, two from other forms of Tubercular diseases, two from Softening of the Brain, and 40 from other causes, chiefly diseases of the Nervous System. Of the 13 deaths in the Royal Hospital for Incurables, three were from Old Age, one from Bright's disease, and eight from all other causes. Of the eight deaths in the Prison, two were from Bronchitis, and one each from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, Alcoholism, Pneumonia, Accident, Suicide, and Execution. Of the eight in the Workhouse, four were from Premature Birth and Developmental diseases, two from Old Age, and one each from disease of the Heart and Bright's disease. In other places not Institutions 64 deaths occurred, 16 of these being from Accidents, nine from Suicide, three from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, four from disease of the Heart, four from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, two each from Influenza, Cancer, Old Age, and Developmental diseases, and 20 from all other causes. 117 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Deaths of Illegitimate Children. 82 deaths of illegitimate children were registered during the year, 11 in Clapham, five in Putney, 22 in Streatham, 15 in Tooting, and 29 in Wandsworth. 23 of the deaths occurred from Premature Birth and Developmental diseases, 20 from Diarrhoea, 17 from Enteritis, four from Congenital Syphilis, two from Whooping Cough, two from Accident, and 24 from other causes. There has been a decided increase in the number of deaths of illegitimate children compared with 1905 when it was 69, but this is due wholly to the increase in the number of deaths from Diarrhoea and Enteritis compared with the previous year. Water Supply. The following Tables, which have been abstracted from the monthly reports of the Water Examiner to the Local Government Board, show the results of the analyses of the water of the two district supplies for each month during the year.

The quality of the water was stated to be good in both the supplies in each month of the year, although in January, February, November and December the amount of Albuminoid Ammonia and the Oxygen required to oxidise were high. In the Lambeth District Supply a trace of free Ammonia was reported in January and December, and in the Southwark District Supply in December. Although the chemical results were on the whole satisfactory, yet the bacteriological results were not quite so satisfactory. In January the Director of Water Examinations reported that compared with December, 1905, the total number of the microbes was greater, and the Bacillus Coli results (both quantitative and qualitative) less satisfactory, the filtered waters containing about twice as many bacteria. In November he stated that chemically the Lambeth and Southwark filtered waters were open to objection as judged by the colour and the oxygen absorbed, and that bacteriologically the deterioration of the raw and filtered waters was still more marked. In the month of December he reported that the raw unfiltered water gave a satisfactory result from a bacteriological point of view, yet the filtered waters gave better results than in November. The Director reported that the Southwark and Vauxhall water yielded the worst results. He specially noted that the Chelsea water also taken from the Thames was, from a bacteriological point of view, satisfactory, but that the Southwark and Vauxhall was unsatisfactory. He explains this by the fact that at the Chelsea works the sand on the filter beds is much above the average in thickness. Owing to complaints received in the month of February the Public Health Committee gave instructions for samples of water to be analysed, but such analyses did not materially differ from those published in the Reports of the Metropolitan Water Board. In November analyses were made of two wells in the district. In one the water was badly polluted and quite unfit for use. The owner of the premises was warned and the Company's water was 121 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. laid on. In another case the water was fairly good, but a bacteriological examination was made which showed that although the Bacillus Coli was present, it was present in such small amount that I could not advise the Committee to order the well to be closed. Cutting-off Notices. During the year 138 notices were received from the Water Board stating that the water supply had been withdrawn. 104 of these notices referred to premises in the Lambeth District Supply, and 34 in the Southwark District Supply. Eight of these premises were in Clapham, nine in Putney, 74 in Streatham, 16 in Tooting, and 31 in Wandsworth. The supply was withdrawn for non-payment of rates from 37 premises, for defects from 39 premises, in 38 the premises were empty, in 22 the cause of the supply being withdrawn was not stated, and in two it was withdrawn by request. Mortuaries. No change has taken place in the four Mortuaries during the year. The Mortuary at Tooting has been thoroughly overhauled, a new concrete floor having been laid down, and a window and screen constructed so that bodies may be viewed without entering the Mortuary chamber. The plans for the new Mortuary at Wandsworth have been prepared, but the necessary land is not yet available. It is hoped that during the current year the erection of the Mortuary will be proceeded with. In Clapham 29 bodies were removed to the Mortuary, in Streatham 35, in Tooting 20, and in Wandsworth 128, of which 31 were from Putney and 11 from Tooting, a total of 212, compared with 188 in 1905. I have also to report that the Regulations and By-laws made by the Council in 1905 have worked very satisfactorily and that no complaints were received by me as to the staff employed there. 122 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. General Sanitary Work in 1906. The following list shows the special inspections made by me during the year :— (1.) Inspection of drains of non-provided schools for the certificate required by the London County Council. (a) Nightingale Square Roman Catholic School. Drains tested with water and certificate granted. (b) Macaulay Road School, Clapham. Drains and water closets tested with water and certificate granted. (c) Rectory Grove School, Clapham. Drains tested with water with satisfactory result. Water closets defective, but to be reconstructed. (d) St. Mary's Convent School, Clapham. Drains tested with water after reconstruction. (e) St. Leonard's Schools, Streatham. Drains tested with water and certificate granted. (f) Charlwood Road Schools, Putney. All drains water tested and certificate granted. (g) All Saints' School, Putney. Drains tested with water and certificate granted. (h) Holy Trinity Schools, Balham. Drains tested and sanitary arrangements reconstructed. (i) Holy Trinity School, Lutheran Place, Streatham. Drains partially reconstructed. (k) St. Joseph's Roman Catholic School, Wandsworth. Drains tested with water and found satisfactory. (2.) By request of the Licensing Justices the Council instructed me to inspect and report on the following Public Houses, and also to give evidence before the Compensation Committee at the Clerkenwell Sessions :— "The Antelope," High Street, Wandsworth. "The Velocipede," High Street, Wandsworth. "The Volunteer," The Plain, Wandsworth. 123 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "The Prince of Wales," Lydden Road, Wandsworth. "The Old House at Home," Dunts Hill, Wandsworth. "The British Lion," Putney Bridge Road, Wandsworth. "The Coopers' Arms," High Street, Putney. "The Bricklayers' Arms," River Street, Putney. "The Railway Bell," Mitcham Road, Tooting. "The Fox," High Street, Tooting. (3.) Special inspections were made of the River Wandle in consequence of complaints of the presence of quantities of sewage fungus in the river and the smell arising therefrom. On inspecting in July I found that the river was in a foul condition owing to the presence of the fungus and that this fungus originated from the outfall of the Croydon Rural Sanitary Authority. That Authority have now reinstated the coke filters and cleansed that part of the river at the outfall, with the result that the nuisance has been to a considerable extent abated. (4.) Special inspections were made of Cubitt's Cottages, the houses in Point Pleasant, Wandsworth, and in Floss Street, Putney, with regard to their sanitary condition. The necessary notices were served and all have been or are now being complied with. (5.) With reference to the houses in The Platt, Putney, of which several inspections were made, instructions were given to the Solicitor that a closing order under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, should be obtained. The magistrate on hearing the position of the defendant with regard to title, adjourned the summonses, and these have not yet been again heard. There is no doubt, however, but that the owner will either comply with the requirements of the Council by carrying out extensive repairs, or by rebuilding the houses. The premises were inspected by a Sub-Committee of the Public Health Committee before a closing order was applied for. 124 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (6.) A Sub-Committee also inspected a number of houses in Garratt Lane known in the past as Jubilee Cottages, but now numbered in Garratt Lane. These properties have for many years been inspected by the Sanitary Inspector and myself yearly, but they have recently become so structurally defective that it was necessary to take steps to close some of them. Notices were served and as a result four of them were closed by the owners, and in the others the necessary repairs are being gradually done. (7.) Special inspections were made during the summer months of several localities, chiefly in Streatham, Balham, Southfields, Wandsworth, Totterdown, Tooting, and various parts of Putney, in consequence of complaints of residents in these localities as to smell from sewer ventilators. These complaints were more numerous in 1906, as a result of the continued dry weather, and a consequent absence of the natural flushing of the gullies, drains, and main sewers. In all 159 complaints were received, from Clapham North Ward four, Clapham South Ward 19, Putney 17, Balham 28, Streatham 29, Tooting 30, Southfield 29, Fairfield five, and Springfield eight. All these complaints were forwarded to the Surveyors who periodically reported that the necessary flushing and cleansing or other work had been done. (8.) With regard to the mews and passages mentioned in previous Reports I have made several inspections of these during the year. (a) The mews at rear of houses in York Road, worth, has been paved by the owners, and the place is now in a satisfactory condition. (b) The passage in the rear of Stanthorpe Road, ham, has been kept cleansed by the owners, but nothing structural has been carried out owing to 125 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. some legal difficulty as to the ownership and responsibility. (c) Simrose Court, Wandsworth, has been repaved by the owners and the houses in the Court rebuilt. Other passages and mews have been inspected by myself and by the Sanitary Inspectors and the necessary notices served, all of which were forthwith complied with. In addition to the above special inspections and the routine inspections of Bakehouses, Slaughterhouses, and Cowsheds, 205 inspections were made of other premises, chiefly previous to the service of statutory notices. My attendance was necessary at the Police Court on nine, at the High Court on two, at the County Court on two, and at the Licensing Sessions on two occasions during the year. Revenue Act. During the year 10 certificates were granted under the above Act and two refused. The certificates granted referred to 160 houses, or 246 separate tenements, and the two refused to nine houses, or 18 tenements. Sanitary Operations. The Table of Sanitary operations shows in detail the amount -and nature of the work carried out by the Sanftary Inspectors during the year. The number of complaints received and attended to was 1,595, compared with 1,357 in 1905, and 1,491 in 1904. There was an increase in both Wards in Clapham, a slight increase in Putney, a decrease in Streatham, an increase in Balham, an increase in Tooting, an increase in Southfield, and a decrease in Fairfield and Springfield Wards, compared with the previous year. The number of houses and premises inspected was 24,458, -compared with 22,383 in 1905, and 17,999 in 1904. 126 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The principal increases were in the Balham, Tooting, and Springfield Wards. The total number of house-to-house inspections was 5,686, compared with 6,290 in 1905, and 6,440 in 1904. There has been a slight increase in the number of house-tohouse inspections in Clapham North Ward, Putney and Tooting, but a decrease in the other Wards. This decrease is due to the pressure of other work, the increase in the number of complaints,, and the increase in the necessary clerical work. 127 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The Tables of house-to-house inspections which follow show the names of the streets and the number of houses inspected, the number of houses in which defects were found, the percentage of defects to houses inspected, as well as the number of families living in one, two, three and four rooms and upwards. In 3,186 out of the total of 5,686 houses inspected, or 56.03 per cent., sanitary defects necessitating the service of an intimation notice were found. The highest percentage was in the Balham Ward, where the percentage was 79.22, and the lowest in Southfield Ward, where it was only 39.53, the next lowest being Springfield, where it was 41.45.

The number of intimation notices served was 7,500, compared with 7,207 in 1905, and of statutory notices 1,044, compared with 1,099 in 1905. The greatest number of preliminary notices was served in the Balham and Fairfield Wards, and the smallest in Southfield and Streatham Wards. The greatest number of statutory notices was served in Balham and Springfield Wards, and the smallest number in Putney and Streatham Wards. With regard to Putney, although 31 statutory notices were served only five were complied with, and this is due to the statutory notices which were served on the owners of The Piatt, which are at present in the Solicitor's hands. With regard to the number in Southfield Ward not complied with, 20 of these were with respect to property in Point Pleasant, the work at which is now in hand. Of the 117 statutory notices not complied with, the majority are in hand and have been complied with in the early months of the current year. The number of statutory notices served include by-law notices, 296 of which were served in respect of the following contraventions of the by-laws : yard paving 88, cleansing house and other contraventions of by-laws as to houses let in lodgings 70, repairs to water closets 59, repairs to flushing apparatus of water closets 32, covers to cisterns 29, cleansing cisterns 16, paving and ing stables one, and repairs to manure receptacle one. The number of cases of overcrowding dealt with during the year was 100, compared with 92 in 1905. Seven of these were in Clapham, five in Putney, 11 in Streatham, 25 in Tooting, and 52 in Wandsworth. There has been a decided increase in the number of cases dealt with in Tooting compared with previous years, due to the poverty of the people residing in one or two streets in that sub-district. In Wandsworth the overcrowding was chiefly confined to the Fairfield and Springfield Wards. All these cases were remedied after service of preliminary notice with the exception of one in Clapham, where it was necessary to issue a summons. 1,219 ashpits were provided or repaired, compared with 1,128 in 1905 and 1,166 in 1904; and 574 complaints with reference to the non-removal of house refuse (62 from Clapham, 92 from Putney, 156 from Streatham, 36 from Tooting, and 219 from Wandsworth), were received during the year. These complaints were, as in previous years, at once forwarded to the Surveyors and attended to by the Dusting Inspectors. Removal of House Refuse. No change has during the year taken place in the methods adopted for the removal of house refuse. The refuse is removed weekly, but in some instances, as in flats, the refuse is removed twice in each week. As regards disposal the methods are the same as in previous years, viz., in the North Ward of Clapham and part of the South Ward, as also in a small portion of lower Streatham, the refuse is sent by rail to shoots in the country. From a portion of Clapham South, Streatham, Balham and Tooting, it is disposed of at the Destructor at Tooting. In Wandsworth and Putney the dust is discharged into barges at Putney and Bell Lane, Wandsworth, and deposited on the low-lying banks of the lower reaches of the Thames. During the 12 months ending March, 1906, 11,789 tons were sent by rail, 19,595 tons were disposed of in the Destructor, and 22,162 tons were barged, a total of 53,546 tons. The total cost of collection and disposal for the same period was £16,923. 183 statutory notices were served under Section 37 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to provide ashpits in accordance with the by-laws and these notices were complied with. 1,094 yards in connection with dwelling-houses and 68 in connection with stables were paved, drained or cleansed, compared with 1,023 and 62 in 1905. 4,954 rooms and 1,038 staircases and passages were cleansed or repaired, compared with 5,565 and 923 in 1905. 141 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 142 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The decrease in the number of rooms cleansed is due to the decrease in the number of house-to-house inspections. The greatest number of rooms cleansed was in Balham Ward, where 1,138 were done, and the smallest number in Southfield and Putney. 1,107 drains were cleansed or repaired and 109 rain-water pipes disconnected from drains. 185 notices of reconstruction of drains were sent on to the Surveyors from this department:—33 in Clapham, 22 in Putney, 77 in Streatham, eight in Tooting, and 45 in Wandsworth. The number of water closets cleansed and repaired was 1,936, compared with 2,141 in 1905, 1,979 in 1904 and 1,783 in 1903. 253 accumulations of manure were removed after service of notice:—25 in Clapham, 44 in Putney, 86 in Streatham, 46 in Tooting, and 52 in Wandsworth. Compared with 1905 there has been a considerable reduction in the number of notices served for abatement of this nuisance. The greatest reduction occurred in Putney, while in Tooting there was a slight increase. 16 notices were served for the removal of manure every 48 hours, compared with 20 in 1905, and 15 in 1904. 842 water cisterns were cleansed, covered or repaired, 288 in Clapham, 68 in Putney, 228 in Streatham, 50 in Tooting, and 208 in Wandsworth, compared with 823 in 1905. 178 premises were inspected and notices served where animals were kept in such a condition or in such a manner as to be a nuisance. 16 of these were in Clapham, seven in Putney, 24 in Streatham, 12 in Tooting, and 119 in Wandsworth. As in former years this nuisance was most common in the sub-district of Wandsworth, and particularly in the Fairfield and Springfield Wards, and the animals kept were in nearly all the cases ducks or hens. 143 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 128 smoke nuisances were reported during the year, five in Clapham, seven in Putney, 10 in Streatham, two in Tooting, and 104 in Wandsworth, 95 of which were in the Fairfield Ward. Proceedings were taken in eight cases and in five fines amounting to £16 10s. were inflicted with 17s. costs, while in two cases orders were made and served with 6s. costs in each case. 11 complaints of black smoke were received from the Public Control Department of the London County Council with regard to 13 premises, and 13 complaints from the Coal Smoke Abatement Society with regard to 22 premises. These were all at once attended to by the Inspectors. 184 soil pipes were repaired, 17 in Clapham, 17 in Putney, 94 in Streatham, three in Tooting, and 53 in Wandsworth, compared ■with 175 in 1905, and 269 in 1904. The number of unclassified nuisances was 893, 278 in Clapham, 136 in Putney, 134 in Streatham, 132 in Tooting, and 213 in Wandsworth, compared with 772 in 1905. Disinfection. The total number of rooms disinfected after the occurrence of cases of infectious diseases was 2,794 (4/6 in Clapham, 143 in Putney, 735 in Streatham, 498 in Tooting, and 942 in Wandsworth), compared with 2,947 in 1905 and 2,527 in 1904. The decrease was due to the decrease in the number of cases •of Scarlet Fever. 1,669 lotes of bedding were stoved at the Disinfecting Station, compared with 1,778 in 1905, and 1,129 in 1904 The 1,669 lots of bedding included the following:—1,165 beds, 1,200 bolsters, 3,043 pillows, 1,285 mattresses, 752 palliasses, 2,383 sheets, 1,790 quilts, 929 cushions, 7,429 articles of clothing, 3,971 blankets, 670 carpets, and 3,269 extra articles, a total of 28,885 articles, compared with 30,477 in 1905, and 20,295 in 1904. 3 144 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 902 premises were disinfected after Measles, and 134 after Tubercular disease of the Lungs, compared with 798 and 161 in 1905. 33 beds, five bolsters, 19 pillows, 34 mattresses, 50 palliasses, nine sheets, four quilts, 13 cushions, 103 articles of clothing, seven blankets, 43 carpets, and 142 extra articles, a total of 465 articles, were removed and destroyed by request of the owners during the year. Disinfection was also carried out by the Sanitary Staff at 15 premises after non-notifiable diseases, chiefly Cancer, and the sum of £7 iis. 4d. was received for such disinfection. The disinfection by steam was carried out at the Station at Tooting, and I am pleased to report that this Station has proved most satisfactory in every way. I have made a considerable number of visits to the Station during the year, and am able to report that the work has been carried out by the staff to my entire satisfaction. I he approximate cost of working and maintaining the Disinfecting Station during the past year, including the cost of disinfectants used in fumigating and cleansing rooms, was as follows : £ s. d.

Inspection of Milkshops, Cowsheds, &c. The following Table shows in concise form the number of milk premises, cowsheds, etc., on the register, the number of inspections, and the number of cases of legal proceedings during the year, as well as other information which it has been thought advisable to group together for the purpose of comparison with other Metropolitan Boroughs.

At the close of 1905 there were 302 milkshops on the Register, 73 have been added in 1906 and 23 removed, leaving 352 on the Register at the end of 1906. During the year 805 inspections were made of these premises and 35 notices, chiefly for cleansing, were served. Two prosecutions were taken for occupying premises without being registered and in all the cases fines were inflicted. Special attention has again been given this year to the enforcing of the Milkshop Regulations, and the notice of all registered purveyors of milk was called to the regulations which deal with the protection of milk against infection or contamination. Two milk vendors were prosecuted for failing to comply with the regulations in that the vessel used for storage on the counter was not covered so as to preserve the purity of the milk against infection or contamination. These milk vendors were convicted and fined in one case 10s. and 2s. costs, and in the other £1 and 2s. costs. Cowsheds. The following is a list of the registered Cowhouses in the district, granted by the London County Council in October:— Clapham— London, Gloucester, and North Hants Dairy Company, Ltd., 31A, Clifton Street.

Turner, G. S., Headworth Road. (26 cows.) The total number on the Register at the close of 1906 was 13, one in Streatham having been removed during the year. Slaughter-houses. There were 22 Slaughter-houses and one Knacker's Yard on the Register in 1905, one in Putney was removed, leaving 22 on the Register. During the year 400 inspections were made of these, but it was only necessary to serve one notice for cleansing. The usual cleansing was carried out by the occupiers at the proper times. During the year the Inspectors inspected the carcases of 122 cattle, 864 sheep, 59 pigs, and 10 calves in Slaughter-houses. 152 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The following list shows the number of Slaughter-houses licensed by the London County Council in October, 1906:— Clapham— Oxley, Alfred, 63, Clapham Park Road, Clapham. Jarworth, William, 140, Clapham Park Road, Clapham. (Condition—The license is granted on the undertaking of the licensee that the killing of bullocks at these premises be restricted to the period of hot weather, and then only occasionally, and on the further condition that the slaughtering be limited to animals the meat from which is to be sold by retail in the shop attached to the premises.) Woodman, George, 140, Larkhall Lane, Clapham. Cradock, Albert Henry, and Gosling, William Edward, . 147, Larkhall Lane, Clapham. Wood, Samuel, 172, Larkhall Lane, Clapham. Wright, Thomas John, 272, Wandsworth Road, Clapham. Simmons, John, 647, Wandsworth Road, Clapham. Warren, James Edward, 63, Old Town, Clapham. Putney— Langston, James, 76, High Street, Putney.

Wood, John James, Dunsford Farm, Merton Road. (Condition—This license is granted on the undertaking of the licensee that his own pigs only be killed at these premises.) Kingston, Thomas Henry, 59, High Street, Wandsworth. (Condition—Small cattle only.) Knacker's Yard. Harrison, Barber & Co., Ltd., Garratt Lane. The above premises have been entirely reconstructed and new appliances installed. The system of ventilation, however, has not worked successfully, but alterations are being made which will eventually improve matters, and prevent the occurrence of any nuisance from the escape of offensive effluvia. Offensive Trades. The following is a list of offensive trades carried on in the Borough :—• (1.) Harrison, Barber & Company, Garratt Lane, Wansworth, Knacker's Yard Do. do. Bone Boilers. Do. do. Manure Manufacturers. (2.) W. C. Milestone, Bendon Valley, Wandsworth, Fat Melter. 154 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (3.) Wickens, Pease & Co., Garratt Lane, Wandsworth, Bone Boiler. Do. do. Tallow Melters. (4.) James Ford, Bendon Valley, Wandsworth Fat Melter. (5.) Dallett & Company, High Street, Putney Soap Boilers. Do. do. Tallow Melters. With regard to No. 1, complaint was made by the Sanitary Inspector that the effluvia from the works were smelt in Garratt Lane, and that on inspecting he found that the furnace used for destroying these effluvia was not burning. Notice was at once served. On the 21 st June the Inspector again reported that there was an offensive smell from these works in Garratt Lane, and on inspecting he found that the doors of the slaughter-house had been left open and the offensive effluvia were escaping into the open air. On the 3rd July the Inspector reported that the furnace used to destroy the offensive effluvia was out, and the offensive effluvia were escaping without being destroyed. On the 23rd July the Inspector again reported a contravention of the By-laws in that the effluvia from the mixing tank chamber, which receives the residues from the boiling room were escaping into the open air causing offensive smell in the immediate neighbourhood. On the attention of the firm being called to this, structural works were carried out and the offensive vapours from the mixing tank chamber were carried by means of a ventilating tube to the furnace and there destroyed. In October the Inspector reported another contravention of the By-laws in regard to the storage of offensive matter in an open shed, and proceedings were taken against the firm, but the case was adjourned sine die, a written undertaking having been given to the effect that the shed would not be used for storage of offensive matter, and the firm agreed to pay £1 is. costs. With regard to No. 3, no complaint was received by me till the month of July, when on the 13th and 18th of that month the 155 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Inspector reported that the door of the boiling room was open and the offensive effluvia escaping, causing a nuisance in the neighbouring streets. No other complaint was received in regard to these works during the rest of the summer. In all 177 inspections were made during the year of the premises where these offensive trades were carried on, five notices were served, and in one proceedings were taken. Ice Cream Premises. At the end of 1905 there were 223 of these on the Register. During 1906, 32 were added and 26 removed, leaving a total of 229 on the Register. 368 inspections were made during the year and 33 notices were served, all of which were for cleansing. Houses let in Lodgings. At the end of 1905 there were 218 of these on the Register. None were added during the year. 438 inspections were made of these premises. 10 notices were served for overcrowding and 406 for other conditions, chiefly cleansing. With regard to 14 premises summonses were issued. In four of the cases a fine of £3 with 6s. costs was inflicted, in seven a fine of £1 15s. and 14s. costs, and in three the costs (6s.) were paid, but no penalty was inflicted. On the whole the new By-laws have proved satisfactory, although some owners still fail to realise that the necessary cleansing must be carried out at the specified time. Offensive Trade Refuse. The arrangement entered into by the Council for the removal of the above by a contractor still continues to work satisfactorily. The only alteration made in the contract this year was that the minimum charge should be 2s. instead of is. as at present. 156 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Unsound Food. During the year three boxes and 10 skate, three boxes of haddocks, three cases and six codfish, one box monkfish, one box roes, one trunk of plaice, one trunk of mackerel, nine boxes of kippers, one kit of coal fish, two barrels of sprats, 20 crabs, 12 rabbits, six score of lettuce, nine crates of bananas and one basket of plums, were destroyed at the request of the owners and the usual certificates granted. In one case proceedings were taken for exposing for sale and selling sausage rolls unfit for food, and a fine of £10 was inflicted with 2s. costs. Canned Foods. In accordance with the instruction of the Council the following report was made:— "14 samples of canned goods have been submitted for analysis, chiefly to ascertain if any preservative was used in the manufacture. Five of the cans contained corned beef, and the nine others—galantine of chicken and tongue, potted tongue, potted beef, potted ham, minced steak, ham loaf, roast beef, beefsteak and onions, and jellied brawn respectively. The samples were purchased in various parts of the Borough, and chiefly in the poorer localities. The Inspector who purchased the samples procured the oldest specimens possible, and that may account for the presence of tin in 10 out of the 14 samples. "All the samples with the exception of one were derived from the United States. The maximum amount of tin found in the samples only amounted to about 0.14 of a grain per 1 lb., not sufficient to be injurious to health. 157 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 'The analyst reports on his examination as follows:— 'The method of procedure with each can consisted in opening and completely removing the contents, which, after being pulped and thoroughly mixed were examined for preservatives and metallic contamination, and in all likely cases aniline dye or other added colouring matter. The preservatives searched for were (1) Boric acid and borax, (2) Sulphites, (3) Formaldehyde, (4) Salicylic and (5) Benzoic Acids. The condition of the interior of the can was also noted together with the manner in which the soldering had been effected, i.e., whether soldered internally or externally. 'With regard to the results obtained, it will be seen that in every sample the contents of the can were sound and in no case were preservatives or added colouring matter detected. 'Evidence of dirt or other extraneous matter was carefully looked for, but in every instance the samples were in this respect satisfactory. 'In only three cases, namely, A, G and N, did the amount of metallic contamination by tin reach "heavy traces." In the remainder it was entirely absent or present only "in traces," and as such could scarcely be regarded as dangerous to health.' " 158 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The following resolutions passed by the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health on the subject of tinned and preserved foods were laid before the Committee and considered:— "That in the opinion of the Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health, it is necessary in order to secure better protection for the public in regard to tinned and preserved foods, that legislation should be passed embodying the following important reforms:— "(1.) That the name and address of the manufacturer and the date of canning should be impressed on the cans. "(2.) It shall be unlawful to sell for any purpose canned goods that are unfit for human consumption, and it should be the duty of any person in possession of unsound canned foods to notify and surrender same to the local authority, who should destroy such unsound food free of charge. "(3.) 'A certain number of tins (say one per cent.) from each consignment should be opened on importation and the contents examined under the supervision or instructions of the sanitary authority concerned prior to such canned foods being placed on the market. "(4.) Tins which are known in the trade as 'doubtfuls' should be deemed to be unfit for human consumption. "(5.) Food intended for canning should be inspected by independent officials prior to being canned, and all foods should be canned under strictly hygienic conditions. "(6.) In the opinion of the Branch the use of preservatives in canned food is unnecessary and should under no circumstances be permitted," stating that such resolutions have been forwarded to the Local Government Board, the Board of Agriculture, the London County Council, and the City and Borough Councils, and expressing the hope that the Council will support the Branch by making representations to those bodies, with the view of obtaining the desired reform. 160 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The Committee recommended that the Council agree with the foregoing resolutions except that the number of tins opened should not be so great as one per cent., and that communications be addressed to the Local Government Board, the Board of Agriculture, and the London County Council in support thereof. Factories and Workshops. I am able to report that there has been a considerable increase in the amount of work done by the Inspectors during the year, and that, on the whole, the condition of all the workshops in the Borough is most satisfactory. With the exception of the work in regard to outworkers no difficulties have been noted, and the difficulty with regard to outworkers has been largely due to the great lessening of the amount of work done by these outworkers, owing either to a decline in trade, or that work is more generally being carried out in large factories or workshops, or to both these factors combined. The Tables which follow are similar to those used in previous Reports, and the whole of the work done by both the male and female Inspectors is there summarised in a concise form. The total number of workshops on the Register was 1,719, including 161 retail bakehouses, 119 workshop laundries, 293 domestic workshops and 1,146 other workshops, but not including 253 factories, 891 workplaces, and 233 outworkers' premises. Including all factories, workshops, workplaces, and outworkers' premises, there were on the Register at the end of 1906, 3,096 premises, compared with 3,045 in 1905, 2,987 in 1904, and 2,676 in 1903. The total number of inspections made during the year was 5,997, compared with 4,933 in 1905, and 4,946 in 1904. The total number of notices served was 427, 399 intimation and 28 statutory, compared with 462 in 1905, and 465 in 1904. There were two prosecutions, one for failing to cleanse a workshop and the other for sanitary defects, and in both fines -were inflicted. i6i Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Under the head of other workshops are included domestic workshops, and under the head of places where food is prepared for sale are included the kitchens of hotels, restaurants, tripe, fried fish and eel shops, and other places where food is prepared for sale. There was a marked increase in the number of inspections of factories during the year, especially of factory laundries and other factories. In all 658 inspections were made of 253 factories and 69 notices, all of these being intimation notices, were served. It is satisfactory to note that no statutory notices were necessary during the year. The total number of workshops on the Register was 1,719, 119 of which were workshop laundries, 161 workshop bakehouses, and 1,439 other workshops. In all 3,233 inspections of these were made, compared with 2,628 in 1905, and 238 intimation and 19 statutory notices were served. The total number of workplaces on the Register was 891, and 1,863 inspections were made, while 119 intimation and seven statutory notices were served. The total number of defects found during the year was 558, including 19 cases in which there was a breach of special sanitary requirements for bakehouses. To abate these nuisances 399 intimation and 28 statutory notices were served, all of which, with the exception of 12, were complied with. These 12 notices were served in the latter part of December and were complied with in the early part of the current year. In all 558 defects were found and 537 remedied, but it was only necessary to serve 399 intimation notices, as one notice frequently called atention to several defects on the same premises. In the case of the statutory notices served intimation notices had previously been served. 162 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. INSPECTION OF FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS AND WORKPLACES. table lxxii.

A footnote should be added to show that this has been done. † The figures required in columns 2 and 3 are the total number of lists received from employers who sent them both in February and August as required by the Act and of the entries of names of outworkers in those lists. They will, therefore, usually be double of the number of such employers and (approximately) double of the number of individual outworkers whose names are given, since in the February and August lists of the same employer the same outworker's name will often be repeated. 166 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. With regard to the foregoing Table which differs somewhat from that which appeared in previous Reports, it will be seen by comparison that the number of outworkers shows a large reduction. There was, however, a slight increase in the addresses of outworkers received from other Boroughs, the numbers being in 1906, 173; and in 1905, 146. The total number of lists received twice a year was 12, containing the names of 113 outworkers, while 21 lists were received once in the year containing the names of 89 outworkers. 243 inspections were made of these premises and 22 defects were found necessitating the service of 14 notices, all of which were complied with. These notices were all for cleansing. The works carried on by these home workers are in this Borough almost wholly tailoring, dressmaking, hosiery making, and bootmaking and repairing. During the year six cases of infectious disease were notified' from the homes of outworkers, five of Scarlet Fever and one of Diphtheria, compared with five in 1905, and 12 in 1904. The following are the districts to which lists of outworkers were forwarded, and also the number of outworkers:—Battersea 27, Lambeth 19, Croydon Rural 16, Camberwell 14, Stepney 13, Fulham seven, East Ham five, Southwark three, Bermondsey, Ilford, Stoke Newington, Wimbledon, St. Pancras, and Chelsea two each, Islington, Poplar, Wetminster, Bethnal Green, Hampstead, and Ealing one each, a total of 122, compared with 231 in 1905, and 246 in 1904. 31 of the outworkers are on the workshop register and the premises were inspected as workshops. 100 of the outworkers were either unknown, removed, had. discontinued work, or had had none for many months. 167 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The Table shows the work done in each sub-district and is grouped under five chief divisions: (1) factories, (2) workshops, (3) domestic workshops, (4) workplaces, and (5) outworkers' premises. The total number of inspections was 1,964, compared with 2,023 in 1905, and 1,849 in 1904, and re-inspected 1,649, compared with 1,222 and 1,014. 674 of the inspections and 201 of the re-inspections were in Clapham, 263 and 597 in Putney, 450 and 196 in Streatham, 129 and 55 in Tooting, and 448 and 600 in Wandsworth. One workshop where males were employed was notified to H.M. Inspector, and 17 were reported by the Inspector to this Council. TABLE LXXVIII. Clapham. Putney. Streatham Tooting. Wandsworth. Total.

The Tables which follow summarise the work done during the year by the female Sanitary Inspectors. The total number of premises inspected was 1,971 (398 in Clapham, 235 in Putney, 663 in Streatham, 149 in Tooting, and 528 in Wandsworth). 151 inspections were made of factories, 1,125 workshops, 78 of domestic workshops, 472 of workplaces, and 145 of outworkers' premises, while 378 premises were visited for enquiry and no workroom found. There were only five cases of overcrowding discovered, compared with 12 in 1905, and 17 in 1904, and these were at once abated. Six were insufficiently ventilated, and 63 were found to be in a dirty condition. In one workshop there was no separate water closets for the sexes, while in nine factories and 11 workshops the water closets were defective. Other nuisances were discovered in two factories, 33 workshops, two domestic workshops, 20 workplaces, and nine outworkers' premises, and these have all been abated. It was only necessary to serve 121 intimation and nine statutory notices, while for the first time since the female Sanitary inspectors were appointed it was necessary to take proceedings for sanitary defects against the owner of premises occupied as a laundry. 55 workshops and 10 domestic workshops where females were employed were reported to H.M. Inspector of Workshops and 58 were reported by H.M. Inspector to this Council. 172 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE LXXX. Clapham. Putney. Streatham. Tooting. Wandsworth Borough.

It will be noted that the number of laundries under the heading of workplaces shows a diminution, this being due to the occupiers removing from the Borough. The total number of trades carried on in the Borough does not coincide with the number of workshops and workplaces, as in many instances several trades are carried on in the same premises.

Canal Boats Act. During the year 31 inspections of Canal Boats were made, but no notices were served. The condition of all the boats inspected was reported to be satisfactory. Statement of Work under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act. Before dealing with the routine work of the Public Health Department with regard to the Food and Drugs Act, some notice must be taken of an important Conference which was held at the Council House during the year. On the 20th June the Chairman of the Public Health Committee, Dr. Gay, brought before the Council the following motion which was adopted :— "That the Public Health Committee invite the registered milk vendors in the Borough to a Conference with the Committee to be held at the Council House or the Town Hall at a convenient date to consider :— "(1.) What methods can be adopted to provide that the milk supply to London might be properly protected from contamination at the time of milking and during transit. "(2.) Any representations that might be made to the proper authorities, if necessary, with the assistance of other Local Authorities in London to ensure the adoption of such methods. "(3.) Any other matters or suggestions that may contribute to the cleanly distribution of milk in London." The Conference was held at the Council House on the 17th July, and was largely attended by the vendors of milk in the Borough. The following resolutions were passed at the Conference :— "(1.) That the Board of Agriculture be urged to bring into force and carry out the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops 177 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Order in the country, with such variations as are applicable in the various districts. (2.) That the Board of Agriculture be requested to take steps to ensure that the udders of the cows, and the hands and arms of the person milking, shall be clean at the time of milking, and that the vessel used shall be clean and be kept solely for the purpose of milking. (3.) That in the opinion of the Conference all railway companies carrying milk should provide proper insulated trucks, as now used by the London and North-Western Railway Company for the purpose. {4.) That the Board of Agriculture be urged to take steps to ensure the carriage of milk in sealed churns. (5.) That in the opinion of this Conference all dairies should be licensed annually, and only licensed dairies should sell milk for consumption on or off the premises, and that all milk on the counter for sale in open vessels should be covered with muslin or other suitable cover. (6.) It was generally admitted that preservatives are not necessary. We recommend, with a view to the delivery of milk in London free from dirt, that a copy of such resolutions be sent to the Board of Agriculture and the other Metropolitan Borough and City Councils and that they be asked, if they approve, to support such resolutions." The Metropolitan Borough Councils of Deptford and Battersea in reply stated that they had written to the Board of Agriculture in support of such resolutions; the Westminster City Council that it concurred in the suggestion, and that it was of opinion that it is desirable that sealed bottles should be substituted for the metal cans now in use for the retail delivery of milk; the Corporation of London and the Kensington Borough Council that they approved of the several resolutions with the exception of so much of resolution No. 5 as relates to licensing. 178 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. During the past year 905 samples of foods and drugs have been submitted to the Public Analyst compared with 853 in 1905. Of these, 84 or 9.2 per cent., were reported to be adulterated, compared with 7.6 in 1905, and 11.33 in 1904. The percentage of milk samples found to be adulterated was io'26, as compared with 7.2 in 1905, and 15.3 in 1903. It would, therefore, appear, judging by the results obtained, that the milk supply of the Borough has somewhat deteriorated; if, however, the tabulated results arrived at by the Public Analyst be carefully examined it will be noticed that in many cases the adulteration is extremely small, so much so indeed that in 20 cases of adulterated milk samples which were reported to the Public Health Committee on account of this it was decided that no action should be taken against the vendor. In 59 cases out of the 84 adulterated samples detected, proceedings were instituted against the vendors.

Although, therefore, the percentage of adulterated samples shows an increase over that of last year, it must not be concluded that the purity of the food supply has deteriorated to that extent. Such a result may be arrived at in many ways; one of which and indeed the most important being the methods adopted in procuring the samples. During the whole of the past year the Inspector has had an allowance in order that he might engage his own assistants to procure samples. This arrangement has enabled him to change them frequently, and works admirably, and probably the result shown in the above Table is in great measure due to this cause. 183 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The following Table shows the number of samples taken in each sub-district of the Borough, together with the percentage per 1,000 of the population, the number of adulterations detected and the percentage of adulteration.

The Inspector nas had during the year five females and three male assistants at his disposal, each of whom appears to be a suitable type of person to be employed in such work. In this respect the Inspector has been fortunate, for it is a matter of experience that it is very difficult to find suitable persons desirous of doing the work, and occasionally, although 185 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. willing, they are poor witnesses at subsequent Police Court proceedings and break down under cross-examination. Much the same methods have been adopted in procuring samples as in previous years, and in many cases where it has been difficult and impossible to detect fraud in any other way a female assistant has procured various articles of grocery, etc., at the shops in question, and, having made herself known to the tradesmen as a regular customer can then procure samples of butter, coffee, etc., for analysis, which will be the same article as "ordinarily" supplied, and this frequently proved to be adullerated. The art of substituting adulterated for the genuine articles has reached a very high pitch of efficiency, and the Inspector reports to me that while he is endeavouring to do his utmost to secure the conviction of unscrupulous traders, there are many "suspects" in the Borough, shops where he is morally certain fraudulent methods are practised. In such cases It becomes necessary to spend a considerable amount of time and attention, frequently having to keep such premises under observation for months. As an example of this I instance the following case which occurred during the year: "A" is a trader in a good class neighbourhood of the Borough, and during the last four years the Inspector has purchased many samples of butter from his shop, employing a female assistant. On each occasion the sample has been returned by the Analyst as genuine. During the year, however, information reached the Inspector from a very reliable source that a considerable amount of margarine was being substituted for butter to regular customers at this particular shop. It was necessary to find a suitable woman living in the neighbourhood who was able and willing to assist. This, a matter of no inconsiderable difficulty, accomplished, she was instructed to call three or four times weekly for various articles, butter included, and she continued so doing for over two months. The Inspector on the last occasion accompanied her and took an official sample, with the result it was found to contain 98 per cent, of margarine. Another instance of fraud which the Inspector was able to detect during the year, which also illustrates the "smartness" of these fraudulent traders, is as follows: "B," a resident at a 186 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. private house in the Borough, employs three or four men for a fortnight to make a house-to-house canvass in certain districts, purporting to sell pure Dorset butter at one shilling per pound, stating that their master has it made on his own farm and sends it up to London twice weekly. It seems strange that purchasers should believe that pure Dorset butter can be sold at such a price, but it is certain that in this particular way this man obtained a considerable number of customers. For some time the Inspector kept him under observation, following him day after day and watching and making a note of the addresses at which he called. The Inspector was surprised to find that the majority of this man's customers were of the upper middle class, and were not as he expected to find, confined to the poorer localities. Eventually the Inspector persuaded a man living in an adjoining house to one of those at which this trader now called, to purchase a sample for analysis, with the result that it was found to contain 96 per cent, of margarine. The work done by the Inspector cannot be properly judged, either by the number of samples taken or by the percentage of adulteration detected, but only by the method employed and the interest shown by the responsible official entrusted with such work. It has been said that 25 per cent, of all butter sold is adulterated, and that only 10 per cent, of the whole, or 2.5 per cent, of the adulteration is detected, but I think that the Borough can lay claim to a somewhat improved percentage of pure butter supplied to its inhabitants. Much difficulty has also been experienced during the year in dealing with certain milk sellers in the Borough, principally small traders who sell two classes of milk, one Separated Milk and the other New Milk, both from the same barrow. The difficulties in this case are obvious, as one can be easily substituted for the other, and, indeed, at private houses where the milk is left on the doorsteps in cans this is done to a very large extent. In these 187 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. cases it is only possible to secure the conviction of an offender by the use of somewhat similar methods as those already described. On several occasions during the year the Inspector on searching barrows has discovered small hand cans containing water. When asked to account for this the invariable reply is that the water in question is used for washing and cleansing cans. Instances such as the above point to the fact that considerable amendment of the existing legislation is needed, giving further powers to executive officials. As has been pointed out in a previous Report, it should be made an offence to carry water on a barrow from which milk is sold, and again if Separated or Skimmed Milk is sold, then the receptacle from which it is sold should be painted a distinctive colour in order that a purchaser may be aware of the nature of the article. In one case only during the year was the "warranty" defence relied upon, with the result that the summons was dismissed. Although the Borough has been fortunate of late years in this respect, it cannot be pointed out too frequently that this method of defence has always to be anticipated, and proved a very serious obstruction in the effective working of the Acts. The case in which this "warranty" defence was pleaded was against a vendor in whose name two previous convictions had already been registered during the preceding 18 months. With regard to the giving of a notice in cases of admixture, it has been observed during the year that such notices, more particularly in cases of coffee and chicory, and chocolate powder, are drawn up and printed with a view to protecting the vendor against a conviction of fraud rather than with the intention of clearly setting forth to the purchaser the nature of such admixture. 188 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In my opinion it should be made compulsory for the exact nature and composition (including the proportion of ingredients) to be clearly printed on the containing wrapper. Only in one instance has it been necessary to issue a summons against a milk vendor for refusing to sell a sample to the Inspector on demand. In conclusion, I am pleased to be able to report that the whole of the work of the department was carried out by the Inspectors and the Clerical Staff to my entire satisfaction. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, P. CALDWELL SMITH, Medical Officer of Health. APPENDIX.

In 1905, a similar result was obtained under this heading. VII.—Meats. One sample of Sausages was analysed and found genuine. In 1905 also, no percentage of impurity was recorded in this division. In addition to the above samples, officially bought and divided at the time of purchase under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 14 samples of unopened Tinned and Preserved Foods were examined, and the results, which were satisfactory, were reported both to the Medical Officer of Health and to the Local Government Board. In conclusion, I may add that the Food and Drug Supply of the Borough has slightly retrograded during the year, the percentage of impurity having risen from 7.62 in 1905 to 9.28 in 1906.
