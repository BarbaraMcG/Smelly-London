MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1902. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, Town Hall, Hackney, N.E. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Hackney Gentlemen, In presenting my Eleventh Annual Report on the Health of the Borough of Hackney, I have great pleasure in stating that the year 1902 has been a most satisfactory one, in many ways, in regard to the public health. In spite of an epidemic of small-pox, which threatened to involve the greater part of Hackney, the death-rate for the year was one of the lowest on record, viz., 16.0 per 1,000 persons living that of all London being 17.7 per 1,000. The death-rate was par' ticularly low, 11-5, in the North sub-district (Upper Clapton and Stamford Hill), and only 18.2 per 1,000 living in the South-East sub- 6 district. The birth-rate is also satisfactory, being for the whol district 282 per 1,000 living, ranging from 21.5 per 1,000 for thi North sub-district to 31.3 per 1,000 in the South-East district. Thi infant mortality for the year was extremely low, viz., 121 per 1,001 births. This low rate is, no doubt, to be largely attributed to tbi mild and wet summer of last year, which greatly reduced the deathi from infant diarrhoea. The chief event from a public health point c: view was, no doubt, the epidemic of small pox; but, in spite of thi fact that for years vaccination had been notoriously neglected in tbi district, the extension of the disease was kept within moderate bounds At no time did the epidemic reach a proportion as to overstrain oi embarras the resources of the Public Health Department to deal with the cases notified. For years the machinery for preventing the extension of infectious disease in the Borough has been improving (so far as isolation or removal to hospital of patients, the disinfection of homes, clothes, and furniture, etc., and the provision of housin; accommodation for families while their homes are being disinfected, can prevent the progress of infectious disease) and I am of opinion that Hackney now stands in the fore-front of Metropolitan Boroughs in the provision of means for dealing with epidemit infectious disease. I have to express my satisfaction of the way in which the Inspectors and Clerical Staff have, on the whole, carried out the duties allotted to them during the year. It is also a pleasure to me to put on record my obligations to Dr. Willoughby Kennedy, and my appreciation of the zeal and ability he exhibited while acting as Medical Officer of Health to the Borough from February 24th to May 3rd, 1902, during my absence through illness. Population and Density.—Applying the rate of increase of population of the last decennium to the year 1902, I calculate the population of the Borough of Hackney at the middle of 1902 to be 221,730 persons. With an area of 3,292 square acres, the density of population is, for the whole district, 67.3 persons per square acre; 7 but it varies from 45.2 persons per square acre in the North Subdistrict to 100 persons per square acre in the South-West Subdistrict. The following table gives the statistics respecting population and density in greater detail:— Table. Showing estimated Population, Area and Density of the Registration Sub-Districts in Hackney, at middle of 1902. North. Central. South West. South East. Total for Hackney Total for London. Estimated Population 51,269 51,462 60,149 58,850 221,730 4,579,107 Area in square acres 1,132 815 601 770 3,292 67-3 74,839 Density = persons per acre 45.2 631 1000 72-5 61-1 Marriages.—The number of marriages solemnized in the Borough of Hackney during the year 1902, was 1,668. This is a decrease of 88 marriages upon the number of the previous year. The marriage rate for 1902 is accordingly 15 per 1,000 of the population. The marriage rate for the County of London for the same period is 17.8 per 1,000 of the population. Births.—During the year, 6,266 births were registered in Hackney, of which 3,140 were males and 3,126 females. Table. Births. Registration District of Hackney. Registration Sub-Districts. All London North Central South West South East Total No. of Births 6,266 1,103 1,470 1,849 1,844 132,810 Rate per 1,000 living 28.2 21.5 28.5 30.7 31.3 28.5 No. of Illegitimate Births 119 Rate per 1,000 Births 19.0 The birth-rate therefore, for the year 1902, is 28.2 per 1,000 persons living. The birth-rate was lowest, 21.5 per 1,000 living, in the North 8 Sub-district, and highest, 31.5 per 1,000 living, in the South-East Sub-district. The above birth-rate shows a slight decline upon the rate for 1901. The birth-rate for all London for 1902 is 28.5 per 1,000 living. *Illegitmacy.—During the year 1902 there were 319 illegitimate births registered in Hackney, but of these 200 were born in the Rescue Homes of the Salvation Army in the Borough, of mothers from outside districts. The number of illegitimate births of Hackney parentage was 119. This gives an annual illegitimate birth-rate of 19 per 1,000 births. Deaths.—The total deaths registered in Hackney during 1902 numbered 3,526; but of these 516 were of persons non-residents of the district and dying in the Public Institutions of the district: but there were in addition 368 residents of Hackney which died in public institutions outside the district. After making the necessary corrections there remains a total of 3,378 deaths of Hackney residents registered during 1902. This is equivalent to a death rate of 15.3 per 1,000 living. Making a further correction for age and sex distribution by means of the factor 1.04645, we arrive at the true mortality for Hackney for the year 1902, namely 16.0 per 1,000 living persons. The death-rate for all London for the same period is 17.7 per 1,000 living. Sub-District. Population. No of Births, Birth-rate Total Deaths. Deathrate. Deaths under 1 year.

The deaths were distributed in the different sub-districts as indicated in the above table. I add here the usual table of the chief causes of infant mortality.

The annual death rate of persons dying during the year at 65 years and upwards is 34 per 1,000 living. INSTITUTIONS OUTSIDE THE DISTRICT, RECEIVING SICK AND INFIRM PERSONS FROM THE DISTRICT.

Specific Febrile or Zymotic Diseases.—The deaths from specific infectious diseases, both notifiable and not notifiable, numbered during the year 533, against 504 during the year 1901. This gives a zymotic mortality of 2.4 per 1,000 living. The zymotic death-rate for all London for the same periods was 2.23 per 1,000. A.—NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Small-Pox.—This disease, which was introduced into Hackney in the month of July, 1901, spread very rapidly during the early months of 1902, reaching its height at the end of March, after which it gradually declined until the end of July, when the disease practically disappeared from the district. The total number of cases notified during 1902 numbered 418, of these 22 were cases of mistaken diagnosis. This gives an attack rate of 1.7 per 1,000 living. Of the number notified there were 71 deaths. This is equivalent to j mortality of nearly 18 per cent, notified, and 0'3 per L,000 living persons. At this stage, I think it will be desirable to give a brief report ol the whole course of the epidemic of small-pox as it affected the Hackney district. The disease, in connection with the recent epidemic, first made its appearance in the Borough of Hackney, in the month of July, 1901. Two cases were notified on the 1st of July. These cases certainly arose from infected articles cleaned at a laundry; for one of the infected persons was a sorter of dirty linen, and the other was the carman employed in collecting the dirty linen at a local laundry. These two cases gave rise to five subsequent cases in their own families. After these there was a pause in the notification of small-pox until August, during which month several cases were notified, having been infected from other sources which could not be definitely ascertained. The epidemic did not assume in Hackney very serious proportions during 1901. The following chart shows the notifications received week by week through the whole 17 epidemic. It will there be geen that it was not until the last week in December that the disease began to assume serious dimensions. The rise in the notifications at that time was caused by secondary cases infected by a fatal case which had been medically attended at home for a week, after the rash had appeared, owing to the nature of the disease not having been recognised by the medical attendant. This one error in diagnosis led to the infection of 24 persons, several of whom died. From this point onwards the disease appears Ito have spread extensively, until it reached its maximum in the last, Kveek of March and the first week in April, during which fortnight Ino less than 77 cases were notified. After this date the disease [gradually declined, until the end of July, when the epidemic, so far lis Hackney is concerned, practically came to an end. There were lour subsequent cases notified during the months of November, since Kvhich date the disease has been absent from the Borough. Thus, Ithe total number of cases of small-pox notified in Hackney during the whole of the epidemic was 467; but of these 30 were, on Subsequent examination, decided not to be small-pox, and were returned to their homes. This gives an attack-rate of 1.9 per 1,000 living persons. The mistakes in diagnois is equivalent to 6.4 per cent. of cases notified. The rate of mistaken diagnosis determined by the Metropolitan Asylums Board for the whole of the Metropolis during the epidemic, amounted to 13.3 per cent. The comparison shows Hackney in a very favourable light lompared with the rest of London. The following table shows the distribution of the notified cases in the different sub-districts of Hackney. All Hackney 467 North 107 Central 127 S. East 124 S. West 109 From these figures it shows that the disease was very nearly evenly distributed over district; no locality could be said to be more affected than the other to any very great extent. 18 The cases were distributed as to age in the following manner:— Cases. Under 1 year 10 1 to 5 years 42 5 to 15 years 121 15 to 25 years 108 25 to 65 years 183 The majority of the cases were, as seen from the above table, adults. The conditions of the cases with respect to vaccination, I was only able to ascertain in a few cases before removal to Hospital, so I do not propose to make any observations on this aspect of the question, as an analysis of the whole of the cases for London will give more reliable information as to the relationship between vaccination and immunity from small-pox. Of course, in this disease, all the cases which could be removed were sent immediately to the fever hospital. All the cases discovered were removed to hospital except the few which died before removal was possible. The deaths during the whole epidemic numbered 76. This is equal to a death-rate of 16-3 per cent, attacked, and -34 per 1,000 living persons. Measures taken to deal with the Epidemic. (1) Vaccination and re-Vaccination. Naturally our first care was to endeavour to get as many as possible of the inhabitants of Hackney protected by vaccination and re-vaccination. The first proceeding was to male enquiries as to the state of vaccination of the children attending tlie Board Schools. The result of this examination is given in my last year's report: but I wish to state here that we were able to examine the arms of nearly 13,000 children, and the names and addresses of all those children whom we found unvaccinated or imperfectly vaccinated, I sent on to the public vaccinators who were able to gel most of them vaccinated. 19 During the year ending 29th September, 1902, which practically covers the period of the epidemic, the public vaccinators of Hackney made 8,780 successful primary vaccinations, and 10,638 successful re-vaccinations at a cost of £4,230 10s. to the public. In addition to this private practitioners all over the district made a large number of vaccinations and re-vaccinations, during the epidemic, which probably amounted to double the above number. Information was also sent by me to the public vaccinator and vaccination officers of every case of small-pox notified or discovered, or of persons who had been in coutact with such cases. By this means the whole of the occupants of these houses were offered vaccination or re-vaccination. (2) Other Measures.—On the notification of a case of small-pox, it was immediately removed to the wharf shelter at Rotherhithe, where the cases were carefully examined again by the Medical Officers of the Asylums Board. Any mistakes of diagnosis were there corrected, and the patients re-vaccinated before tbeir return home. After the removal of the patient to hospital, the rooms occupied by the patient were disinfected and cleansed, all clothes and bedding being taken to the Municipal Steam Disinfection Station, where they were disinfected by high pressure steam. The masters of any schools which children in the infected dwelling had been attending, were at the same time informed of the circumstances, so.that these children should be excluded until such time as they may safely return to school. The employers of any persons residing in the infected house were also informed of the circumstances. In the majority of cases, this meant the exclusion from work of all such persons for two or three weeks with a consequent loss of income. The result in the majority cases was that many persons were reduced to the brink of starvation, for a large number, although in great want, would not apply for parish relief; and as a matter of fact, the guardian officials did not like persons coming from infected homes and applying for relief, neither did they like visiting the unfortunate contacts in their homes 20 Somewhat tardily the Local Government Board issued a circular letter authorizing local authorities, on the recommendation of their medical officer of health, to expend a reasonable sum in retaining in exceptional cases in their homes, persons who have been exposed to infection. In my opinion this letter did not go far enough, because it did not appear to recognise the present condition of things. This letter states: "The Board, therefore, think it desirable to state that they are advised that, under ordinary circumstances, the quarantining at their homes of inmates of such dwellings is not necessary in districts in which sanitary matters are properly administered and vaccination and re-vaccination are efficiently carried out," again, "If, on a dwelling becoming invaded by small-pox, the actual patients are at once removed to hospital, the dwelling and all articles in it that have been exposed to infection, including the clothes worn by the other inmates, are properly disinfected, and the inmates of the house are immediately re-vaccinated or vaccinated (as the case may be) there is no material advantage to be gained by keeping these other inmates at home." Now this letter assumes that vaccination and re-vaccination can be enforced. Why the fact is that vaccination cannot be efficiently carried out, because it is left to the guardians of children to decide whether it shall be done; and re-vaccination being a purely voluntary matter, it is almost unnecessary to say that it cannot in the existing state of the law be efficiently carried out. There is another side of this question which should be mentioned. Even though an inmate of an infected house might with safety go to work, the employers in the majority of cases will not have him back, until something like a fortnight to three weeks have elapsed. In practice it was found that the best line of action in dealing with contacts was to quarantine them at home, and allow them sufficient each week to keep them from applying for parish relief, making it a condition for receiving this assistance, that each member should either be vaccinated, or as the case may be, re-vaccinated. This 21 practice in Hackney was very successful in getting the community vaccinated or re-vaccinated, and no doubt contributed to the early diminution of the disease. I am of opinion that in the present state of the law more latitude should be given to local authorities in the expenditure of money in dealing with contacts, and not restrict the expenditure to special cases as indicated in the circular letter. The amount expended during the epidemic in Hackney in payments to contacts during quarantining amounted to £74 lis. This is a very small sum compared with the advantages gained by this expenditure. Our new shelter was made available for the reception of persons while their homes were being disinfected early last year, and became a help in dealing with small-pox. The last severe epidemic of small-pox in Hackney was in the year 1885. On examining the death returns for London, it will be seen that prior to the above date, London was never free from small-pox even so far back as 1840. In only two years were the deaths below 100, and these years were 1874 and 1875, when the deaths from this disease respectively reached the numbers of 56 and 75. The disease used to recur every two or three years with fatal severity. Since 1885 there has been no epidemic in Hackney until the late epidemic, and very little in all London with the exception of the years 1893 and 1894, when the deaths n mbered respectively 206 and 93. The causes of the immunity of London for 18 years are not far to seek. Firstly.—Prior to 1886, cases of small-pox were received and treated in hospitals in London; but in this year the treatment of small-pox cases in London was abandoned and transferred to Long Eeach. This is a very important measure in freeing London from small-pox. Secondly.—Compulsory notification of infectious disease was introduced in the year 1889. This is another important measure in controlling the spread of infectious disease. 22 Thirdly.—The increased provision of hospital accommodation and equipment for the removal and treatment of small-pox. Fourthly.—With the notification of infectious disease local authorities were obliged to put their sanitary staff upon a more suitable scale for dealing with infectious disease, in the way of supervising the isolation of cases which may ba suitably isolated at home, the disinfection of homes, furniture, and articles of clothing, and the adoption of other measures likely to prevent the spread of infectious di ease. These have no doubt contributed largely in keeping London almost free from small-pox for about 18 years; but the outbreak of last year shows that measures such as those indicated above are inadequate alone to keep London free. I think it may be truthfully stated that no place was ever so well equipped for dealing with an outbreak of small-pox as London was last year; nor do I think that preventive measure were ever better applied both by the Asylum's Board and the Health Departments of the local authorities; but the result shows, that the. one thing needed to rid London of this dread disease, is the successful vaccination or re-vaccination of every person in London, and that cannot be brought about except by the alteration of the law. Besides a bracing up of the law relating to infant vaccination, a law of compulsory re-vaccination is needed. Until this is brought about we may expect a recrudescence of the disease at intervals of a few years. There is one other circumstance connected with this epidemic which should be mentioned. Early in the epidemic one or two hemorrhagic cases of small-pox occurred, which terminated fatally before they could be removed to hospital. The bodies were immediately removed by the undertaker, who had the contract, to the Mortuary, but, unfortunately one of the men employed by the undertaker contracted the disease and died. The undertaker then declined to remove any more bodies of persons dying from this disease; and I could not obtain any other undertaker to contract for this work. Subsequently cases were removed in one of the Borough disinfecting vans to the Mortuary by the men employed in disinfection. This 1902. SCARLET FEVER, DIPHTHERIA and TYPHOID FEVER. incident prepares one for similar treatment in any subsequent epidemic of small-pox. I am of opinion it is the duty of the Local Authority to provide against a repetition of such incidents by providing a vehicle for the conveyance of dead bodies to the Mortuary. During ordinary periods there is need for such a conveyance, and the need will get greater as the population increases. Scarlet Fever.—During the year under consideration 880 cases of scarlet fever were notified in the Borough of Hackney. Of these, 11 were subsequently determined not to be suffering from this disease. This leaves a total of 869 genuine cases of scarlet fever notified during 1902. This is equivalent to an attack-rate of nearly 4 per 1,000 persons living in the Borough. The disease was evenly dis" tributed over the district, The accompanying chart shews the disease to be prevalent during the whole year, being rather more so during the latter than the former half of the year. On two occasions the weekly notifications reached the number of 33, but this number speedily fell. The causes of these rises were not obvious. Out of the number of cases notified we were able to get 653 removed to hospital. This is equivalent to 75 per cent. of the total. The deaths registered from this disease during the year numbered only 14. This is equivalent to a death-rate of 1.6 per cent. cases notified, and .06 per 1,000 living persons. The age distribution and age at death are set out in the annexed tables. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup.—During 1902 there were 690 notifications of diphtheria and 12 of membranous croup received. Of this total 29 cases were subsequently found not to be suffering from diphtheritic disease. This leaves a total of 673 diphtheritic cases notified during the year, which is equivalent to an attack-rate of 3 per 1,000 of the population. This disease has been prevalent during the whole year. At no time could it be said that Hackney has been free from diphtheria during 1902. The lowest number of cases notified during a week was 5; this happened on two occasions. The highest number in any week was 21. The disease was rather 24 more prevalent during the first six months of the year than during the latter half, and was more prevalent in the central sub-district than in the remaining parts of the Borough. The cases were distributed through the Borough in the following proportions: Cases of Diphtheria and Membraneous Group occurring in the different Sub-Districts. Hackney North Central SouthEast SouthWest No. of cases of Diphtheria and Membranous Croup 702 147 210 188 157 Rate per 1000 population 31 2.8 4.0 3.1 2.6 Of the total notified 506 were removed to hospital. This is equal to 72 per cent. of the cases notified. The deaths from this disease during the year numbered 60. This is equivalent to a mortality of 89 per 1,000 attacked, and nearly.3 per 1,000 of the population. During the year 25 samples of material from the throats of suspected cases of diphtheria were sent to the Jenner Institute for examination. In 11 of these the special micro-organism of diphtheria was isolated; in 13 cases the result of examination was negative, Anti-toxin was supplied to medical practitioners during 1902 to the number of 15 bottles. Enteric or Typhoid Fever.—During the year there were 181 cases of this disease notified; but of these 11 were returned from hospital as not suffering from enteric fever, thus reducing the total notifications to 176 cases. Of these 7 were infected outside the Borough. The Borough has at no time during the year been free from this disease. 25 During the months of August, September, October and November the disease was more prevalent, but even at this time it did not assume the proportions of a serious epidemic. The above figures show a slight improvement in the incidence of this disease in the Borough on that of 1901. The number of genuine cases notified during the latter year was 186. The attack rate for 1902 is therefore .8 per 1.000 living persons. The largest number of cases occurred in the Central and South-East Sub-districts, the notifications in these being respectively 59 and 57. The cases removed to hospital numbered 122, which is equal to 65 per cent. of the total. The deaths from this disease numbered 27, which gives a deathrate of 15 per cent. of those attacked and .12 per 1,000 living. Each year's experience strengthens my conviction that cases of typhoid fever should not be treated at home unless under special circumstances, with ample accommodation and the attendance of a trained nurse. During the year we have had several cases treated at home in poor families, and nursed by untrained relatives. Almost invariably secondary cases, usually the nurse, occur. In one instance we had four secondary from such a case. The lamentable point about these cases is, that the advice to be treated at home emanates usually from the medical attendant. There were nine cases of typhoid during the year attributed by the relatives of the patients to the consumption of shell-fish ; but I had nothing beyond the statement of these relatives to support the connection of the disease with shell-fish. Typhus.—No case of this disease appeared in the Borough during 1902. Continued Fever.—Six cases were notified under this heading during the year 1902, one of which was removed to the fever hospitalThere were no deaths from this disease. Puerperal Fever.—Sixteen cases of this disease were notified during 1902, and of these 4 died. The mortality is equal to 25 per cent. of cases attacked. The attack-rate per 1,000 births is 2.5 and mortality .6 per 1,000 births. 26 Plagues.—I am pleased to report that this disease did not appear in the Borough during 1902. Erysipelas.—I received during 1902 no less than 320 notifications for erysipelas. This is equivalent to an attack-rate of 1.4 per 1,000 living. Of the total notified 63 were removed to general hospitals or to the Infirmary. The deaths numbered 16, thus giving a mortality of .07 per 1,000 living. Chicken-pox.—The experience of 1902 justified the action of the Public Health Committee, who recommended that chicken-pox should be made a notifiable disease during the prevalence of small-pox in the district. The Order of the Local Government Board made the disease notifiable in Hackney for a period of 6 months beginning from the 1st of January, 1902. This Order was not renewed by the Local Government Board because in the meantime the London County Council has requested the Local Government to make the disease notifiable for the whole of London. It continued to be notifiable, having been renewed three times, until the 6th January, 1903. During the year 1902, there were 1,471 cases of this disease notified in the Borough of Hackney. The interest connected with the notification of chicken-pox is wholly in its relation to small-pox, and the frequency with which the latter disease was mistaken for the former, This mistake was not infrequently made: but the reverse mistake was rather more frequent, that is, rather severe cases of chicken-pox were regarded as cases of small-pox. There is also no doubt that many cases were notified as chicken-pox, which were varieties of derm itits. Several cases of scabies were also notified as chicken-pox. The Public Health Committee accepted my view early in the late small-pox epidemic, that it would not help much in the discrimination of cases of chicken-pox from small-pox, unless with the notification of the former disease there was also a systematic examination of the cases as they were notified. I undertook to do this in addition to my other duties of Medical Officer of Health. My opinion of the value of notifying cases of chicken-pox during the late epidemic of small-pox, is that it was a measure which I thought necessary in acquiring a more complete control over the. 27 spread of small-pox; it was a measure which proved of great value in acquiring information of cases of that disease which otherwise would never have been notified, and as a result would have led to a great extension, as they were regarded as cases of chicken-pox, both by parents and medical attendants. In this borough the number of such cases of small-pox mistaken for chicken-pox reached the number of 22. It is a measure which I am of opinion should be resorted to when small-pox becomes epidemic in London; for it is not at all likely that small-pox will ever become so common in London as to enable every medical practitioner to have an expert knowledge of this disease, so as to avoid errors of diagnosis. The visits made to places, where cases of chicken-pox occurred, led to the abatement of nuisances, which otherwise may not have been revealed to the local authority. B.—NON-NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Influenza.—This disease was slightly more prevalent in the Borough during 1902 than during the previous year, the deaths reaching the number of 44. The ages at death show that this disease is chiefly one of adult life. Of the above deaths 3 were under the age of 5 years; 3 between 5 and 25 years; and 38 between 25 and 85 years of age. The mortality for 1902 is equivalent to a death-rate of .2 per 1,000 living. Diaerhœa.—There were 103 deaths certified from diarrhoea; there were in addition 30 from enteritis or gastro-enteritis. The deaths from diarrhoea under 1 year of age numbered 83, and from enteritis and gastro-enteritis 18. Including the whole of these deaths under the cause diarrhoea, we get a mortality of .6 per 1,000 living. During 1901 there were 168 deaths certified to be due to diarrhoea, and 77 due to enteritis or gastro-enteritis. So that during 1902 there were less than half the number of deaths from the above causes than during 1901. The diminution is no doubt due to the cold and wet summer of 1902, the mean temperature of June, July and August 28 being below that of the corresponding mean temperature of 1901. It will be seen that during last year the deaths registered under the terms enteritis and gastro-enteritis were just in the same proportion as those registered under diarrhœa, as observed during 1901; showing that all the deaths are probably due to the same cause, and the distinctions made in the description is purely arbitrary. The deaths from enteritis and gastro-enteritis under one year may therefore be regarded with those under the head of diarrhœa, as deaths due to epidemic diarrhoea. Measles.—This disease was not quite so fatal during 1902 at during the year 1901. There were 74 deaths in the Borough, of which 71 were amongst children under 5 years of age. This probably does not represent the total mortality, as some of the deaths from measles may have been entered under other causes which have intervened as complications of the disease. An attempt is now being made to reduce this high mortality, by applying some of the sections of the Public Health (London) Act, relating to the prevents of infectious disease to measles. I do not for a moment think that this effort will diminish the prevalence of measles ; but it will I think have a tendency to lessen its mortality, which no doubt is due to want of care in the treatment of cases of this kind. If all parents learn that measles is a serious disease, and that exposure and neglect is likely to cause serious and probably fatal complications, much will be done towards diminishing its mortality. The death-rate for the year 1902 from this disease is .33 per 1,000 living. Whooping Cough.—This is another disease the mortality of which amounts to a high figure every year. The disease was more wide spread during 1902 than during the previous year, the deaths during 1902 numbering 87, while they only reached the total of 49 during 1901. The mortality for the year is therefore .39 per 1,000 living. Of the total deaths from this cause 84 occurred amongs children under 5 years of age. The remarks which I have made 29 above with respect to measles may be applied to some extent to whooping cough. There is no doubt that the latter disease is in itself more serious, and complications are more numerous, independent of neglect and exposure; but the two circumstances will in this disease, as well as in measles, lead to a greatly increased mortality. We are doing something in this Borough to awaken the uninformed to a knowledge of the serious character of this disease, and instructing them in the measures which should be adopted to lessen its mortality. CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. Tuberculous Disease.—Under this bead I include all those deaths due to tubercle of the body whether general or confined to certain organs. Thus, during 1902, there were 449 deaths from tuberculous diseases and they were registered under the following heads:— Tuberculous Phthisis (Pulmonary Tuberculosis) 125 Phthisis 179 Tuberculous Meningitis 49 „ Peritonitis 11 Tabes Mesenterica 25 Tubercle of other Organs 2 General Tuberculosis 58 449 This total is slightly less than that for 1901, the deaths from the same cause being 499 during that year. The death-rate from tuberculous diseases during 1902 is 2 per 1,000 living persons. Cancer.—During the past year there were 190 deaths in the Borough of Hackney registered from this cause. This is equivalent 30 to a death-rate of .86 per 1,000. Below is given a table of deaths from this disease during the years 1893 to 1902. Years. 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 189 1899 1900 1901 ] Deaths from Cancer. 160 157 153 138 164 199 200 190 182 190 Death-rate per 1000. .60 .70 .70 .64 .75 .90 .87 .86 .82 .85 From the above table, it would appear at a first glance, that it throws some light so far as this Borough is concerned, on the question whether Cancer is on the increase. That the number of cases and the mortality-rate has increased since 1893 is quite clear: but it is not so certain, that the figures prove a real increase in the prevalence of the disease, it is believed that the increase is apparent rather than real, and is due to improved diagnosis: because with the increase of Cancer there is a decrease in the number of diseases entered under such terms as tumour and other ill-defined causes. On the other hand it is probable that a part of the increase is due to better diagnosis, and part to a real increase. But side by side with the belief that the Cancer is on the increase, comes the reassuring news, that medical skill is almost within measurable distance of finding a remedy for this dreadful disease. Already it has been stated that cases of certain forms of Cancer, have, in a few cases, been arrested by means of the Bontgen light and Finsen's light. It is probable that Cancer will become amenable to treatment in some such form as the above. 31 TABLE OF DEATHS Of Inhabitants of the Hackney District between 1st Jan. and 31st Dec., 1902.

The following is a copy of the returns made by the Vaccination Officers to the Guardians for the six months ending June 1902. Out of a total of 3,110 births, only 1,698 have been successfully vaccinated, which is equivalent to a little over 54 per cent. This shews a great improvement upon the numbers for previous years, the percentage of successful vaccinations for the first six months of 1901 being 43 per cent. It is to be feared that the improvement is due to the fear raised by the presence of small-pox. The number of conscientious objections as evidenced by the certificates received remains at the same level as during the first half year of 1901. The epidemic of small-pox has not increased their number. Return made on the 8th February, 1903, by the Vaccination Officers of the Hackney Union, respecting the Vaccination of Children whose Births were registered in their Districts from 1st January to 30th June, 1902, inclusive. REGISTRATION SUBDISTRICTS COMPRISED IN THE VACCINATION OFFICER'S DISTRICT. Number of Births returned in the "Birth List Sheets" as registered from 1st Jan. to 30th June, 1902.

Nuisances. (a) Complaints.—During the year 1902 we received no less than 2,410 complaints as to the existence of nuisances. These were enquired into by the inspectors of the various districts. In addition 188 workshops were inspected for the detection of nuisances. Notices were served for the abatement of any nuisances found and these were subsequently abated during the year. (b) House to House Inspection.—The number of these inspections made during the year was 629, and were made in the more populous and insanitary parts of the district. The greater bulk of the nuisances found, viz., 3,466, were abated during the year. Of these 3,138 were abated on the service of an intimation notice alone, 293 on the service of statutory notices, and 35 required legal proceedings to be initiated before they were abated. In addition to the above inspections no less than 32,865 re-inspections of premises had to be made, either during the progress of the work or before the work was commenced. This amounts to an average of nearly six visits, taking one nuisance with the other, before the nuisance is abated. In the majority of cases the number of visits largely exceeds this. The Register of Sanitary Work in another part of this report gives further details of the work carried out by the inspectors. Infctious Disease.—The number of inspections made on this account was largely in excess of those made in 1901. The prevalence of small-pox added largely to the inspections. The number of inspections made after the notification of infectious disease was 3,687. In each of these cases the drains of the house were tested and the premises examined for any other nuisance. If the patient were nursed at home, the inspector saw that there was sufficient accommodation and that the patient was properly isolated. The rooms fumigated reached the number of 2,838, and of these 1,009 were cleaned ; i.e., the walls were stripped of their paper, the walls, ceilings, and floors, and woodwork washed with disinfecting fluid, and the ceiling whitewashed. 42 Disinfectants were supplied during the year at the Town Hall to applicants. Carbolic acid in proper blue phials marked poison, in accordance with the law on the subject, was given to applicants in quantities of 4 oz. for home disinfection. The number of bottles given out was 821. Carbolic powder and sanitas powder were issued in one pound bags to applicants. The total number issued during the year was 7,963 bags. In addition the following disinfectants were issued to the Surveyor's Department:— Tons. Cwts. Qrs. Lbs. Carbolic Powder (Road Gullies, &c.) 8 8 0 0 Kuna Pine, Solids (Street Wateirng) 2 10 0 0 Kuna Pine, Liquid, 40 gallons (Public Urinals) Sanitas Powder (Sewers, &c.) 14 5 0 0 Articles Seized Unfit foe Food.—These amounted during the year to 1 ton 10 cwt. 3 qrs. of fish; 1 ton 1 cwt. and 3 qrs. fruit and vegetables, and 1 cwt. 3 qrs. of meat. Frequently articles are voluntarily brought to the Town Hall, by the owner of the articles, to be examined by myself, or by the inspectors, for the purpose of obtaining a certificate that the articles are unfit for food. The articles are mostly fish, which have been bought wholesale without examination, on a guarantee that the articles are sound. The purchaser on arriving home often finds on unpacking the goods, that they are unfit for food. If he can obtain from an authorized source a certificate that the articles are unfit for food, he is able to get the purchasemoney refunded. I have always encouraged this voluntary delivery of unsound food, and given certificates where I am of opinion the food is unsound. Of course in these cases the food is delivered up to us, and we cause it to be destroyed. COWHOUSES, DAIRIES AND MILKSHOPS ORDER. Up to the end of June, 1902, these were inspected at intervals by the sanitary inspectors of the districts, in whose districts they were situsated. Experience proved that this arrangement was not a good one to ensure the best results of supervision. I therefore recommended the Committee to appoint one of the sanitary inspectors to 43 devote his whole time to the supervision of cowhouses, dairies, milkshops and slaughter-houses. The Committee made the appointment, and the results have realised my anticipations. Mr. Bobbitt was appointed to this work at the beginning of July. His instructions were to inspect the cowhouses, dairies and slaughter-houses at least once a month, and the milkshops at least once every six months. Cowhouses.—The cowhouses in the Borough number 33. The inspector reports that he made 124 visits to these, and found in 7 cases that repairs were needed, all of which were executed. On four visits excessive accumulations of manure were found. These were removed on service of notices. Want of cleanliness was complained of on 18 occasions. Milkshops and Dairies.—There are 340 of these in the Borough. The inspector made to these 723 visits, and on 56 occasions he had to complain of the want of cleanliness of the measures or utensils used. This form of complaint is almost entirely confined to the small milkplaces such as general dealers. In 13 instances the paving was found defective, and three of the places required limewhiting. These defects were remedied by service of a notice. Legal proceedings were initiated by the Council against a milk dealer for refusing to allow the inspector to inspect his utensils. The milkseller was convicted of the offence and fined £2 and costs. The Public Health Committee inspected the cowhouses and slaughter-houses in the district. The premises were found generally in a satisfactory condition, but in one instance no dustbin was provided in connection with the adjoining house, in one, the premises was dirty, and accumulations of refuse were observed in two places. Slaughter-houses.—There are 29 licensed slaughter-houses in the Borough of Hackney, and the number is yearly decreasing This decrease has been going on for some years. I find on reference to my annual report for the year 1892 that there were in that year 39 slaughter-houses in the district, so that since that date, although the 44 population has been increasing, there has been a decrease of nearly 26 per cent. in the number of slaughter-houses of the district. This decrease is going on all over London, and is no doubt largely due to the importation of increasing quantities of slaughtered animals. This foreign meat is also largely sold to the public as British meat, and an enhanced price is charged for it. Many thousands of Londoners consume foreign meat under the impression that they are being supplied with the meat of native fed animals. Where butchers can profitably carry on their business in this way, there is less necessity for slaughter-houses in the districts. The decrease in the number of slaughter-houses is so rapid, that it would not be out of place to revive the question of providing one central slaughter-house for the district, to be under local control or County Council control. The advantages to the public of such centralising has already been dealt with by the Medical Officer of Health to the London County Council in his report on this subject. I may briefly state here the advantages of a central abbatoir. 1. There would be a complete control over the quality of meat imported into the district. 2. Measures could be adopted to distinguish foreign meat, so that it may not be sold for home fed and slaughtered meat. During the last decenium there has been an increase of population in Hackney from 198,606 to 219,288, about 10 per cent.; but as seen above there has been a decrease in the number of slaughter-houses in the district of 26 per cent. These two facts of course prove that the butchers of the district purchase more meat, large quantities of it being foreign carcases, the home slaughtered decreasing in the same ratio. In order to show how much of the meat consumed is slaughtered in the districts, I have made enquiries at all the slaughter-houses in the district, and find that during the year 1902 there were in the 45 whole of the Borough only 2,110 cattle (oxen and heifers), and 26,387 sheep and lambs slaughtered, for a population of 221,730. It shows that a large quantity of the meat is introduced in the form of carcases from other districts. The inspector paid 158 visits to the slaughter-houses, mostly during the slaughtering hours. On six occasions he had to complain of want of cleanliness and twice of non-compliance with the bye-laws relating to slaughtering. In five instances he found that repairs of a slight nature were necessary. These were soon attended to. The inspector during the visits examined the carcases of 74 oxen and heifers, 267 sheep, and 3 calves and found the following organs diseased:— Oxen—Four livers with distomata Two „ „ abscess. Sheep—Two „ distomata One „ „ abscess Four „ „ other parasites One heart and lungs inflamed I may here observe that this Inspector is specially qualified as a meat inspector. Offensive Trades.—Of these there are only three in the district, viz., one tallow melter, one gut scraper, and one tripe boiler. Thirteen visits of inspection to these were made and on each occasion it was found that the bye-laws lelating to these trades were being observed. Smoke Nuisances.—During 1902 there were 554 observations made by the smoke inspector. These observations lasted each from half to one hour. Intimations and statutory notices were served in 63 cases. No summonses for this offence was applied for during 1902. 46 Sec. 48 (2) Public Health (London) Act.—Twenty-two certificates of sufficient water supply under the above section of the Public Health (London) Act, have been supplied during 1902, to the owners of new or rebuilt houses. These certificates have reference to 92 houses. CANAL BOATS ACTS, 1877—1894. The inspector appointed to this work reports that 87 visits were made to different parts of the canal, 94 boats were inspected and one re-inspected; 86 of the total were found to conform with the Acts and Regulations, and infringements of these were observed in 9 instances. The following are details of infringements found:— Certificate did not identify owner 1 Certificates not on board 3 Marking either absent or defective 4 Vessel for drinking water not provided 1 Bilge water not removed 1 Painting defective 4 14 CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACT, 1900. During the year 32 applications were made to me by the owners of the same number of premises to make inspections of the properties with a view to obtaining certificates which would enable them to claim exemption from inhabited house duty. I inspected and after certain alterations had been made gave the required certificates The 32 applications referred to above includes no less than 387 tenements. 47 ICE CREAM VENDORS. By the London County Council (General Powers Act) 1902, the local authority, that is the Borough Council, have power now to contro in some measure the conditions under which ice cream and similar comodities are manufactured. The extent of this control may be gathered from the following extract, from the Act referred to:— Any person being a manufacturer of or merchant or dealer in ice creams or other similar commodity who within the County— (a) Causes or permits ice creams or any similar commodity to be manufactured, sold, or stored in any cellar, shed, or room in which there is any inlet or opening to a drain or which is used as a living room or sleeping room; (b) In the manufacture, sale or storage of any such modity does any act or thing likely to expose such commodity to infection or contamination or omits to take any proper precaution for the due protection of such commodity from infection or contamination; or (c) Omits on the outbreak of any infectious disease amongst the persons employed in his business, or living or working in on or about the premises in or on any part of which any such commodity as aforesaid is manufactured, sold, or stored, to give notice thereof forthwith to the Medical Officer of the Sanitary District in which such business is carried on or such premises are situate; shall be liable for every such offence on conviction in a Court of Summary Jurisdiction to a penalty not exceeding Forty Shillings. 48 Every itinerant vendor of any such commodity as aforesaid shall if not himself the manufacturer thereof exhibit in a legible manner on a conspicuous part of his barrow a notice stating the name and address of the person from whom he obtains such commodity, and if such vendor is himself the manufacturer of such commodity he shall in the same manner exhibit his own name and address. Every such itinerant vendor who shall fail to comply with the provisions of this Section shall be liable for each offence on conviction as aforesaid to a penalty not exceeding Forty Shillings. Proceedings for the recovery of the penalties shall be instituted by the Sanitary Authority for the District in which the offence was committed, or of the District to the Medical Officer of which such notification as aforesaid ought to have been made or in which such itinerant vendor as aforesaid shall offer any such commodity as aforesaid for sale as the case may be. We may now hope to have some beneficial influence over the conditions under which these commodities are made, and the conditions under which the vendors live. Most of the itinerant vendors are the manufacturers, and the Act provides that their names and addresses shall be legibly written on some conspicuous part of the barrow. This will give us the opportunity of inspecting the premises where the articles are made, if they reside in the district. I find already that some of the itinerant vendors of ice creams in this district reside in other districts; and the reverse state of things no doubt exists, i.e., that manufacturers of ice creams living in Hackney ply their their trade in other districts. However, I have no doubt the Medical Officers of Health will transmit to each other the names and addresses of such as reside in their respective districts. 49 DEAD BODIES AND THE MORTUARY. There is one question of very grave importance connected with the health of the Borough which has forced itself upon my attention during the last year. It has been brought to my knowledge, once by the coroner of the district and from other sources, that it is the custom of undertakers in the Borough to receive dead bodies on their premises and to keep them there several days, until it is convenient for burial to take place. The undertaker is usually not very particular as to where the body is kept. In one case, I am informed, the body was kept in a coffin, loosely covered, in the front shop adjoining the street, in another case in the common passage of the house at the foot of the stairs (the upper part of the house being occupied). In another case several bodies of infants were kept in a cellar; in another the outhouse in the back yard served as an asylum for the dead. I may here add that in two cases brought to my knowledge, the undertakers who had possession of the bodies would not bury them, until they had been paid the cost of the funeral. That this practice is general may be proved from the following facts:—In Hackney by the census of 1901 it is shown that there are 4,827 tenements of one room, 7,211 of two rooms, 9,387 of three rooms, and 7,664 of four rooms, a total of 29,087 tenements of only four rooms and under. Now it is quite clear that if a death occurs in a family occupying one or two rooms, it is absolutely impossible for the body to be kept decently and without injury to health in the tenement until burial takes place. The same remarks apply to the majority of the three and four roomed tenements, which are occupied to their full extent. During 1902 only 8 bodies were taken to the public mortuary of the Borough to await burial. From this it is clear that the majority of the bodies of persons dying in tenement houses of one, two, three and four rooms have been kept on the premises of undertakers to await burial. These are not new facts. Similar statements were made before a Royal Commission appointed in 1893 to enquire into the subject of 50 death certification. Certain suggestions were made by this Commission to remedy the present state of things, but nothing has yet been done. The objections to the above practices are obvious. 1st.—It is dangerous or injurious to the health of persons in the houses for dead bodies to be stored therein. 2nd.—There is a lack of decency and respect shown to the dead in the practice mentioned. Another objectional practice is that connected with the disposal of what are known as still-births. Here again the undertakers come to the help of those who desire to dispose of undesirable births. It is usual for the undertakers to receive the still-births and at a convenient time deposit them in graves when an opportunity serves. This is really more serious than the former practice for it opens the way to crime. It is only necessary for the body of a child to be called a still-birth to stop all enquiries as to the cause of death, and the undertaker will do the rest. To remedy the above state of things, it is necessary (1) that the aw should be amended requiring that all dead bodies, which cannot be safely and decently retained in an unoccupied room, should be taken to the public mortuary, and there kept until the burial takes place. 2) "That all still-births, which have reached the stage of develop ment of seven months, should be registered upon the certificate of a registered medical practitioner, and that it should not be permitted to bury or otherwise dispose of the still-birth until an order for burial has been issued by the registrar." This latter is a recommendation of the Royal Commission of Death Certification of 1893. I am of opinion the registration of still-births should not be confined to those of seven months' development or more. I think it would be better to fix six months' development or more as a registration age: but unless every still-birth is examined by a properly qualified practitioner it would still be possible for many still-births to escape registration. 51 FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901. Section 132 of the above Act provides that "the Medical Officer of Health of every district Council shall, in his Annual Report to them report specifically on the administration of this Act in workshops and workplaces, and he shall send a copy of his Annual Report or so much as deals with this subject, to the Secretary of State." In accordance with this order, I herewith give an an account of be administra ion of this Act so far as it relates to workshops and workplaces in the Borough of Hackney, during the year 1902. Preliminary.—The Borough of Hackney which has an area of 3,234 square acres, a population of 221,730 persons and about 31,000 inhabited houses, was regarded 20 years ago as a part of the surburbs, its population then consisting mostly of the well-to-do niddle class with a proportion of the independent classes ; the working classes formed then a small portion of the population, at the present time the artizans form the very great bulk of the population. This will be seen from the following table prepared from th6 census returns of 1901. The analysis of the population of Hackney, with respect to occupations was not given in the census of 1881, twenty years ago, so that an exact comparison of the populations of this Borough at the two periods of 1881 and 1901 cannot be made, but it is sufficient to know that between the periods the character of the Borough has greatly altered. From being almost rural district, it has become essentially a working class and manufacturing district. In support of this statement, I have only to state that there are 367 factories and over 1,658 workshops in the districts, and these are increasing every year. During the year 1902 there were 29 fresh factories and workshops erected in the district.

In a few words, Hackney may be called to some extent an industrial district, being more and more given over as years pass to the manufacture or preparation for sale, &c., of various commodities, chiefly articles of wearing apparel. The following analysis of the works carried on in the workshops registered in the district shows this clearly. Workshops.— Of the total number of workshops registered there are 1192 in which various articles of wearing apparel are manufactured, and 466 where other articles are manufactured. The following is a list of these two classes of workshops tabulated according to the occupations carried on therein:— ANALYSIS OF OCCUPATIONS CARRIED ON IN THE REGISTERED WORKSHOPS OF HACKNEY. (A) Wearing Apparel. Occupations. No. of Workshops. Occupations. No. of Workshops. Boot and Shoe Manufacturer 181 Hat Manufacturer 8 Fur Trimming 8 Juveniles'Clothing 9 Mantle Makers 81 Shirt Makers 13 Tailoring 38 Baby Linen 8 Garabaldi Makers 2 Fall Net Chenilling 4 Artificial Flower Makers 11 Blouse Makers 50 Boot Machinists 112 Bib Makers 2 Dressmakers 212 Millinery 22 Slipper Makers 3 Gaiters 2 Underclothing 26 Embroidery 2 Fancy bows on shoes 8 Collars 4 Furriers 52 Pinafores 3 Infants' Millinery 14 Skirts 16 Tie Making 191 Trimmings 15 Nursery Shoe Makers 19 Costumiers 2 Stay Makers 8 1,192 Waistcoat Makers 36 Children's Costumes 15 Dressing and Tea Gowns 15 54 (B) Other Occupations.

In the workshops of other occupations, females alone are employed in 187, males alone in 11, and both sexes in 258 workshops. So that of the total number of workshops on our list there are 985 which employ females alone, 11 males alone, and 640 where both sexes are employed. It will be seen from the above figures that most of the work connected with the workshops registered comes within the sphere of duties which the female inspector has to perform. During the year, in addition to the other work, 46 notices of the establishment of new workshops, and 25 complaints of nuisances in workshops were received from the Factory Inspector. The male inspectors of the Borough Council inspected 51 workshops and 131 workplaces (the latter being the kitchens of restaurants and eating houses in the district, and are referred to in more detail hereafter). Any nuisances found were satisfactorily abated. Miss Teebay made during the year 137 primary inspections, and 1,151 re-inspections of workshops. Further details of her work are given in her report appended hereto. 55 Bakehouses.—The Public Health Committee instructed me on the 6th of November of last year to report to them on the question of underground bakehouses in the district, and the application of Section 101-102 Factory and Workshops Act, 1901, to these bakehouses. My report on this subject was presented to the Committee early in this year, but as it has reference to the work of 1902 I do not hesitate to append it to the report. The Public Health Committee are still considering the principles which should guide them in certifying underground bakehouses as suitable for the trade carried on therein. There are 66 underground bakehouses, and 53 aboveground bakehouses. During 1902 these bakehouses have been systematically inspected, and any cleansing or repairs required have been duly executed under the supervision of the Sanitary Inspectors. Workplaces.—In the month of March, 1902, a copy of a report by the Public Health Committee of the London County Council, on the subject of the sanitary condition of restaurant and hotel kitchens, was considered by the Public Health Committee of the Hackney Borough Council; and I was instructed to have the whole of such kitchens inspected, and any nuisances or insanitary conditions found to be remedied. I ascertained there were 121 of such kitchens in the Borough where food was prepared for the public. Most of them were small, being the kitchen of what had been a private residence, or an ordinary shop. Each inspector made an inspection of those in his district and the following is a summary of the results of their inspections. RESULTS OF INSPECTION OF KITCHENS. No. of kitchens above ground 97 „ „ under „ 24 No. found dirty 32 „ with defective drains 20 „ „ other nuisances 60 These results justify the action taken by the central and local authorities in having the inpections made. I may here add that the defects found above have now been remedied. 56 HOME-WORK AND WORKERS. Sec. 107 of the above Act provides that: The occupier of every factory and workshop and every contractor employed by any such occupier in the business of the factory or workshop shall— (a) Keep in the prescribed form and manner, and with the prescribed particulars, lists showing the names and addresses of all persons employed by him, either as workmen or as contractors, in the business of the factory or workshop, outside the factory or workshop, and the places where they are employed: and (b) Send on or before the first day of February and the first day of August in each year copies of these lists to the District Council of the district in which the factory or workshop is situate. These lists it is the duty of the local authority to examine, and to forward the names and addresses of every outworker, resident in other districts, to the local authority of such district. The object of supplying the local authority with these lists is no doubt to enable an inspection to be made of the premises on which such outworkers do their work, and to check work being done on premises which are in such a state as to be dangerous or injurious to the health of those employed thereon; or to prevent work being done under conditions which might lead to an extension of infections disease. In order to effect the objects in view, it is obvious that something more than a mere perfunctory performance of the duty placed upon the local authority is necessary. The extent of the work needed may be grasped by studying the following list of outworkers we now have on the register. Total outworkers on the register 1583 (a) Outworkers whose addresses were obtained locally, either from employers or by inspectors 949 (b) Outworkers whose addresses were forwarded by other local authorities 634 57 The following analysis shows the trades followed by the outworkers comprised under (a).— Trade. No. of Out workers. Trade. No. of Out workers. Boots and Shoes 436 Skirts and Mantles 194 Ties 68 Blouses 58 Millinery 49 Underclothing 34 Fur trade 20 Trimming 19 Tailoring 9 Collars 5 Pinafores 4 Shirts 32 Steels 12 Belts 4 Gloves 3 Net Chenilling 2 949 With respect to the outworkers under (b) whose addresses have been sent by other local authorities. The homes of these have not yet been inspected, so I am not able to give similar information as to their employments. The local authorities from which we have received names and addresses of outworkers during the last year are the following :— City of London 200 St. Albans 2 Finsbury 156 Chelsea 1 Islington 107 Hampstead 1 Shoreditch 43 Paddington 1 Bethnal Green 36 Southwark 1 Poplar 24 St. Pancras 1 Marylebone 16 Tottenham 6 Leyton 12 West Ham 2 Camberwell 2 Walthamstow 8 634 On examinatiun of the lists of outworkers supplied to the local authority by the employers we found the names and addrssses of 323 58 outworkers who were residing in other districts. There were sent on to the respective districts. The following is a list of these local authorities with the numbers of names and addresses sent on to them. List of outworkers forwarded to other Boroughs during 1902:— Bethnal Green 98 West Ham 7 Shoreditch 65 Stepney 14 Finsbury 7 Poplar 28 Tottenham 11 Walthamstow 21 Leyton 9 Camberwell 6 Islington 32 Stoke Newington 7 Lewisham 1 Deptford 1 Wandsworth 1 Uxbridge 1 Southwark 2 Hornsey 1 St. Pancras 1 Edmonton 1 Chingford 1 Bermondsey 3 East Ham 4 Lambeth 1 323 With regard to the duties of the local authority in respect to work. shops and workplaces this may be briefly summarised in the statement that they are responsible that these places are kept in a sanitary condition, i.e., they must be kept (a) clean and free from offensive effluvia, not allowed to be (b) overcrowded, must be kept (c) ventilated in such a way as to render harmless any gases or impurities produced in the course of the work carried on there. In any workshop where the floor is liable to be wet through any work carried on (d) provision must be made for its proper drainage. Also (e) sufficient and suitable sanitary conveniences for both sexes must be provided. In order to carry out the above duties it is necessary not only that the workshop and its appurtenances should in the first instance be satisfactorily arranged, but that they should be periodically visited, and in order to check overcrowding, that surprise visits should be made during hours of overtime work. I think the workshops and workplaces of the district should be inspected twice a year, as is done with the bakehouses of the district. In the majority of the workshops tabulated above where articles of wearing apparel are manufactured, the workers are females. As the local authority has 59 decided that the female workers and the workshops where they are employed should be visited by a female inspector, the great bulk of the workshop inspection will fall upon the female inspector appointed by the local authority. The same remarks will apply with equal force to the inspection of outworkers' homes. Reference to the list of occupations of outworkers living in Hackney, shows that the great bulk of outworkers are females. Here, I think, perhaps an annnal visit is all that is necessary at present for outworkers, but this I think should at least be done because the district is getting more and more overcrowded, i.e., more families are being crowded into houses, so that unless there is some supervision work may be done by outworkers under conditions, which would be prejudicial to the workers, and also tend to the spread of infectious disease. This condition is becoming worse, owing to the increase of the immigrant classes from the Continent. At the census of 1901 there were 1,851 male and 1,350 female foreigners resident in Hackney. These persons do not bring from their homes a very strong belief in the necessity for the maintenance of a high standard of sanitation, either in their homes or workplaces. All these circumstances point to the fact, that at least one inspection of the outworkers homes should, as a routine measure, be made every year. The foregoing may be accepted as a measure in some respects, of the supervision needed in order to fulfil the new duties cast upon the local authority, in respect to workshops and outworkers. It is quite clear that the female sanitary inspector, upon whom the bulk of the inspections must necessarily fall, cannot possibly make the visits required unaided. Miss Teebay who was appointed to inspect the workshops, and to control the conditions under which workers are employed has, except for a short period, while she was unavoidably absent from her duties through illness, most assiduously and successfully devoted her energies to the work she was appointed for: but with all her perseverance Miss Teebay, was not able to accomplish more than 137 primary inspections of workshops, and 219 of outworkers homes. Her re-inspections of these premises amounted to 1,151. In 60 estimating the number of inspections which may be made by an Inspector, it must be remembered, that in connection with the inspections there is a great deal of clerical work to be done; and time is also taken up in interviewing the owners of property, where any works are to be executed. Briefly, it is impossible with only one female inspector to deal with the whole of the workshops and places : but I am of opinion that with another Inspector I should be able to have the workshops inspected twice a year, and the out-workers homes once a year. If the workshops and out-workers were to continue to increase (as there is every likelihood of their so doing) it will of course, be necessary to again consider the question of an increase of staff. Difficulties met with in Administration of the Factory and Workshops Act in Relative to Workshops. Sanitary Conveniences. — It is provided in the Factory and Workshop Act, 1902, that the Secretary of State may determine a standard of sufficient sanitary conveniences. This is very much needed in London. One question of importance has forced itself upon my notice, and that is, is it absolutely necessary that w.c. accommodation should be provided on the premises ? Many occupiers of small workshops, if the accommdation for both sexes is not on the premises, can make arrangements for this to be had in the neighbourhood. I see no objection to this, provided the borrowed convenience is not used by too many persons. If such conveniences must be on the premises, the provision of them will fall so heavily on the owners of small workshops and businesses, as to cause them to close rather than go to the heavy outlay of building additional conveniences. In connection with this question, one must have regard to the character of the workshops. I mean that the majority of workshops in Hackney are adapted private houses or parts of private houses, and to bring these workshops up to the standard of modern requirements would be ruinous to a great many of the occupiers, who are only in a small way of business. The result will tend to increase the number of large workshops and factories at the 61 expense of the small workshops. Whether this will tend to the ultimate good of the country is a matter for speculation. Should separate accommodation for the sexes be enforced in every case? Take the case of a small workshop where four women and one man or a boy are employed or the reverse. Should separate accommodation be enforced in such a case ? The conditions here are such as probably obtains in almost every private house where lodgers are received, and it does not appear to me that violation of decency would be committed by allowing with suitable arrangements, the one convenience for such a workshop. I am inclined to advocate the principle that separate w.c. accommodation should not be enforced, until the numbers employed in the workshop reach a certain number. Say, for instance, not until the total number of workers reached the number of five, or possibly a higher figure might be taken; but in any case, I am of opinion that it is not necessary to enforce separate w.c. accommodation when the workers only number one or two of both sexes. The only result of enforcing this, is the gradual crushing out of existence of the small workshops, owing to increased expense. Ventilation and Temprature.—The enforcing of the law with regard to ventilation in workshops is the duty of the local authority; that with respect to the maintenance of a certain temperature in workshops is the duty of the Home Office through their Inspectors. Now, ventilation and temperature are so closely connected, that the present division of supervision is anything but satisfactory. If for instance a bad form of heating arrangement is approved of by the Factory Inspector, by its vitiation of the atmosphere of the workshop, an alteration of the methods of ventilation may be necessary to meet this : or again, suppose, a small workshop is allowed to be heated by means of gas burners. Here the ventilation must be altered to meet the circumstances. Now ventilation and heating are so closely connected, that I am of opinion they ought to be under the supervision of one authority, it matters not which, except to the occupier, who would probably be relieved of much anxiety, if both these matters "were settled by one inspection at the one time. 62 DISINFECTION. During the year 1902 there were 2,838 rooms fumigated and 1,009 cleansed by the officers of the Public Health Department after infectious disease. The number done each month may be seen from the following table. Number of rooms fumigated and cleansed each month during 1902. Month. Rooms Fumigated Rooms Cleansed. Remarks.

By section (60) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, every London Local Sanitary Authority is bound to provide, free of charge, temporary house accommodation, with the necessary attendants, for persons who have been compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of having them disinfected by the Sanitary Authority. So long ago as 1891 I advised the local authority to provide a shelter for this purpose. It was not until early in last year that the local authority saw their way to make this provision. It was then included in the scheme of a new disinfecting station. Dp till last year payment was made to persons who were obliged to leave their home during the disinfection, for the accommodation they had been obliged to procure elsewhere. This payment was made on the scale of 2/6 per room each night. The arrangement was very unsatisfactory. No control could be exercised over the choice of accommodation made by the displaced tenants. Probably they obtained access to families who were already crowded, and may in some cases have carried infection with them. My reason for this last assumption is based upon my experience of the use of the new shelter provided. Since it has been opened I have been called twice to see the members of the families housed, and have on each occasion found a person suffering from infectious disease. This would under the old system have led to an extension of disease in the Borough. These cases alone quite apart from a priori reasoning are in my opinion a triumphant justification of the action of the local authority in providing this accommodation. The shelter has been described in my last year's report; but I may here repeat, that it consists of four tenements capable of accommodating a similar number of families at one time. Each tenement consists of two living rooms, a scullery, bath-room and w.c. The building was ready for use in March, 1902. Below is given a table of the number of persons housed there during the year. 65 Statement of Persons Lodged and Maintained at Council's Shelter, in Millfields Road, Clapton, N.E., during the year ended 31st December, 1902.

These persons came from 45 tenements, 33 being one-roomed tenements, and 12 two-roomed tenements. The persons housed received board during their stay. Such provision has been authorised by the Local Government Board in a circular letter addressed to the local authorities last year. I may here add that one great advantage of the shelter is, that every person who is admitted consents to taking a bath, either on admittance or before leaving. Invariably the persons housed expressed their satisfaction and pleasure at the accommodation afforded on leaving the building, and many would willingly make a longer stay. I may here state, that at first there was a great reluctance to use the shelter, but by tact and perseverance this was overcome, and now there is not only willingness, but even eagerness at times to accept the accommodation. Cleansing of Persons Act.—In connection with the disinfecting station we have provided baths for both sexes, for persons who are infected with parasites. During the year we had 3 persons apply for the use of the bath. Whilst taking the bath their clothes were disinfected by superheated steam. Summary of Clerical Wore of Public Health Department, 1902.

During the year 1902 a great change was made in the matter of the disposal of the house refuse of the district. Up till the end of April the old system of depositing the house refuse on a shoot by contractors who were paid per cart load of one cubic yard, continued. The total number of loads removed during these four months was 18,554 at a cost of £4,746 9s. 5d. At the beginning of the month of May, the new Refuse Destructor in connection with the Electric Lighting Station began to receive regularly the house refuse of the district for destruction. The contractors who had been removing and disposing of the refuse prior to this date, continued for some weeks to remove it from the houses of the district, but instead of depositing it on a shoot delivered it at the destructor works. The payment for this was still continued at per load; but the price was reduced during this period 1/3 per load. The period in question extended from the 1st May to the 24th of June. From the 25th June to the 26th July was a period during which the Public Health Committee had the house collection made directly without the intervention of contractors, hiring men, horses, vans, etc., at 12/- for each man, horse, van, and implements. During this period 2,926 tons of refuse were delivered at the destructor works at a cost of £763 16s. This works out a little over 5/2 per ton delivered. There is no doubt that this cost would have been much lower, if we could have advertised for tenders for the supply of men, horses and vans, for a definite period : but there was not time for this, and the terms had to be arranged at a few days' notice for carrying on the work of collecting, until fresh contractors had been engaged tor the work. With the regular disposal of house refuse by combustion, it was necessary to get fresh contractors to collect and deliver it at the destructor works at a certain rate per ton, or during emergencies, to collect and dispose of at some shoot at a certain rate 68 per cubic yard. The Contractor selected by the Council was Mr. E. Shellard, of Bristol and Paddington, who began his contract on the 28th July, and continued the work during the remainder of the year under review. The following were Mr. Shellard's prices: NORTH DIVISION. SOUTH DIVISION. Collected and delivered at Destructor Works per ton 3/3 3/9 Collected and Disposed of on a shoot 1/3 1/3 From the 28th July to the 31st December this Contractor delivered at the Destructor works 16,092 tons of refuse at a total cost of £2,653 1s. 6d. One of the conditions of Mr. Shellard's contract was that he should have under his control the 35 men hitherto employed by the Council for assisting the contractor in the removal of the refuse, and controlling the order of visits so that, as far as possible, the collection might be brought in as close agreement with the bye-law of the L.C.C. relating to the periodical removal of house refuse. The contract included the condition that Mr. Shellard should receive £8 per day as wages for the men transferred to his control. The following table gives the quantity of refuse removed from occupied houses in the district during the year, and the cost of removal together with cost of disposal during the first four months of the year. During the succeeding months of the year as above observed, the refuse was destroyed in the destructor. The cost of destruction during this period has been estimated by the Borough Electrical Engineer at 2/ll½ per ton, the total for the period of the year during which the destructor was in operation, viz., from May 1st to 31st December, amounting to £3,908 5s. 1d. I am informed that this price for destruction will be increased in the future, because the cost of maintenance of the destructor must be included in the cost of destruction. This hitherto has been borne by the contractors. It is estimated that the cost of destruction in iuture will amount to 3/7 per ton. 69 DUSTING ACCOUNT, 1902. MONTH.

The following is a table showing the number of requests received for the removal of dust during the past year, compared with similar returns for previous years. The large number of requests, received during the month of July, was due to the temporary character of the arrangements made for the removal of dust, during the interval which took place between the expiration of the old contracts, and the commencement of Mr. Shellard's contract.

A visit paid about the same time (August) to the river elicited complaints, from persons who are obliged to spend a large part of their time in the neighbourhood, of the offensive smells which frequently emanate from the river. At the time of my visit the weather was mild, and rains had recently fallen, but the river at the White Hart Hotel, was then turbid in appearance and foul to the smell. This condition was observed some distance along the backwaters of the river in this district. As to the cause of the pollution, this has been pointed out to the Haokney Local Authority in my earlier reports, but in corroboration of earlier statements I should like here to quote from a letter sent to this Council on the subject of the pollution of the River Lea from the Secretary to the Lea Conservancy Board. He states : " The pollution of the Channelsea River and back waters about Stratford and West Ham, is caused by the Sewage of Walthamstow and Leyton, and the discharges from the Storm Water Outfalls of the London County Council Sewers at Old Ford." Enclosed with the same letter was a copy of a report of the Engineer of the Lee Conservancy Board on an inspection of the river made by that officer. He states "I made a special inspection of the Channelsea River and Stratford back rivers on Tuesday last, the 22nd instant (July), also of the Leyton and Walthamstow effluent discharges, and the whole River Lee through Hackney marshes." " The whole of the streams were much polluted and offensive." Again, " I then walked on to Temple Mills, and followed this stream to Quartermile Lane, and then through the G.E.R. Temple Mills siding to the culvert under the railway which discharges the combined effluents of Leyton and Walthamstow. Here the river was very oflensive, and a large volume was being discharged which, instead of flowing on down towards Temple Mills, flowed northwards and down the old River Lea through Hackney Marshes." The conditions met with on the Leyton Sewage Works were as follows:—" Five tanks were dry, and appear to have been so some time. The effluent in one tank was quite clear, but the other was 74 in a disgraceful state. Sewage was flowing in at the top and out at the bottom, direct into the ditch." The effluent from the Waltham stow sewage farm was described in the following terms:—" The effluent was brown in colour, rather thick and of a sewage nature, but not very offensive from the bank." The Engineer to the Lea Conservancy Board sums up the matter in the following terms : " The cause of the polluted state of the old River Lea and the Stratford back rivers, and the Bow river is principally attributed to three causes, taking them in rotation downwards, viz.:—Walthamstow effluent, Leyton effluent, and the discharge from the L.C.C. outlets at Old Ford. The latter flows up with the tide, over Old Ford tidegates into the back rivers, and as it flows up joins with the other two evil effluents, so that the whole state of things is not satisfactory. The remedy is simple, the authorities should adopt the lower Lea Valley Sewage Scheme, and the L.C.C. should enlarge the Northern Outfall Sewer, and abate the discharge of crude sewage into the navigation at Old Ford." A copy of the above report of the Engineer having been forwarded by the Secretary of the Lea Conservancy Board to the Public Health Committee by whom it was considered, I was instructed to enquire of the Secretary what further steps had been taken by the Board in this matter. As a result of my interview with the Secretary, a letter, of which the following is a copy, was sent to the Town Clerk for the information of the Council. Lea Conservancy, 14, Finsbury Circus, E.C. 17 th September, 1902. Sir, LOWER LEA VALLEY—MAIN SEWERAGE. I am directed to forward herewith for the information of the Hackney Borough Council a copy of the Report and estimates on the proposed Lower Lea Valley Main Sewerage and Sewerage Disposals prepared by the Engineer of the Lee Conservancy, also a copy of Sir Alex. R. Binnie's report on the same, and a copy of the Plans and Sections of the Scheme. 75 As your Council are aware, the complaints of the condition of the Lower District of the Old Lee and its Tributaries have been constant for many years past, and the Conservancy have endeavoured to get the various Authorities to combine to adopt some scheme whereby the whole of the Sewage could be diverted and taken away right out of the District—this being in their opinion the only proper solution of the difficulty. They have, therefore, expended some £600 in preparing this Scheme, and it is now for the various Authorities interested to carry it out. The Reports have been submitted to them and the London County Council for some few months, and the Conservators hope that the time is not far distant when the Authorities will combine and form a Special Drainage District, and remove the nuisances complained of from the Lea. I am, Sir, Yours faithfully, (Signed) GEO. CORBLE, Clerk. Town Clerk, Hackney Borough Council, Town Hall, Hackney, N.E. The Lea Valley Sewer Scheme, described in the report and plans forwarded with this letter, may be briefly described in the following ex'ract from the report of S. A. Binnie to whom the scheme was submitted for his opinion :—"The scheme now proposed embraces an intercepting sewer, which, commencing near Waltham Holy Cross, would receive the sewage of the various districts in the Lea Valley and carry it either into the Main Drainage System of the London County Council " (Scheme A) " a point a little east of the Abbey Mills Pumping Station ; cr, as an alternative to an entirely new outfall to be constructed east of the river Boding and South of Ilford " (Scheme B). This latter scheme "imposes on the Authorities the duty of treatment and disposal of the sewage at the outfall." The Engineers describe the method of treatment and disposal of the sewage at the outfall in the following terms :—" It is proposed to acquire an area of 120 acres, as shewn on the plan, for the purpose of carrying out the work of purifying the sewage. It is proposed to construct open subsidence tanks of sufficient capacity to contain the daily dry weather flow from a population equal to one half of the ultimate population. The sludge obtained from the subsidence in 76 these tanks will be withdrawn as it becomes necessary and disposed of upon the lower parts of the land. The sewage will pass over a weir from these tanks to twelve artificial filters or contact beds. These beds will be filled and emptied in succession automatically twice in the 24 hours, sufficient time being given for aeration between the fillings. The effluent water upon leaving the contact beds will be delivered through a cast iron pipe in the River Thames below low water." Sir A. Binnie, in summing up his comparison of r he two schemes, makes the following statement. " Reviewing, therefore, the whole subject, I consider that the scheme laid before you is very good, but the preponderating advantages of an independent outfall as suggested in Scheme B, far outweigh anything that can be said in favour of Scheme A." The action of the Lea Conservancy Board in causing the above scheme of a main drainage scheme for the protection of the Eiver Lea from contamination, to be formulated and reported upon by Sir A. Binnie, brings the problem of the purification of the River Lea, within measurable distance of solution. It is, in my opinion, quite clear that the duty of the Borough Council is to urge by representation and every other practical way the Lea Conversancy Board to bring about the adoption of the scheme recommended by Sir A. Binnie. THE MORTUARY.

METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF HACKNEY. To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Town Hall, Hackney, February, 1903 Gentlemen, In accordance with your instruction of the 6th November, 1902, I have inspected the whole of the underground bakehouses in the Borough of Hackney, and beg herewith to submit my report on the same. The business of a baker has justly been regarded as an unhealthy trade. The comparative mortality figure stands at 958, that for all occupied males at 967, and all males at 1000. The death.rate for bakers and confectioners in the years 1880.2. between the ages of 25 and 45 years, was 8.70 per 1000, and between the ages of 45 and 65 years, 26.12 per 1000. A part of this mortality is no doubt inseparable from the trade. The workers are exposed to great fluctuations of temperature during their work. The humidity of the atmosphere varies greatly, both heat and moisture being at their maximum during the emptying of the ovens. The workers are also exposed to dust and steam, and at times to disagreeable emanations from the materials used. Most of the baking is done during the night, and the hours of employment are exceptionally long. It has been observed that all night workers are pale, of a low tone of body, and are subject to many ailments. But while some of the high mortality of bakers and confectioners may be inseparably connected with the business of baking, a large part of it may be attributed to the bakehouses in which they spend their working hours. 82 Bakehouses have been regarded as notoriously unhealthy for many years, the most unhealthy being underground bakehouses. Much has been done in recent years by the Legislature and by Local Authorities to improve their condition, but the evils attaching to underground bakehouses have not been removed by past efforts. They are really beyond all amendment in most cases. In the first place, it is impossible to adequately ventilate a bakehouse, which is entirely underground, unless by artificial means such as fans, etc. Investigations have been undertaken at different times to determine the comparative purity of the air of underground bakehouses with that of above.ground bakehouses. It has been proved that the air of the former is much more laden with micro.organisms and carbonic acid gas than the latter, and this we can readily realize from the difficulty which is experienced in their ventilation. In the second place, it is almost impossible to get sufficient natural light to most of the underground bakehouses of the borough. Where there is want of light uncleanliness is usually at its height, and the lowest forms of life flourish. This is bad both for baker and for the food manufactured. It is an axiom of Public Health, that food should not be manufactured in any insanitary places. The manufacture of food in most underground bakehouses violates this principle. The remedy for this state of things is the entire abolition of underground bakehouses. This is now recognised, for all modern bakehouses are built above ground, where they can be adequately lighted and ventilated. I am of opinion it is the duty of the local authority to further this movement by encouraging the abolition of all underground bakehouses in their district, under the powers of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901. I cannot help here remarking, that in my opinion, it was a great mistake on the part of the Legislature, to cast upon the Local Authorities the responsibility of granting certificates that underground bakehouses are suitable as regards construction, ventilation, light and all other respects, when in most cases it is impossible to make them suitable. 83 A difficulty connected with the granting of certificates for underground bakehouses is, that once a certificate is granted, there is an official sanction given to a class of work places, which from their vary construction is unsuitable for the trade carried on in them. Again, while the bakehouse remains in the condition in which it is when the certificate is granted, it cannot be withdrawn. But, taking the whole circumstances into consideration, it is evident that the Legislature intended that the Local Authority should have a discretionary power, in regard to the closure of underground bakehouses. The following are the sections of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901, relating to bakehouses :— FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901. (a)—Bakehouses in General. Section 97.—(1) It shall not be lawful to let or suffer to be occupied or to occupy any room or place as abakehouse, unless the following regulations are complied with :— (a) A watercloset, earthcloset, privy or ashpit must not be within or communicate directly with the bakehouse ; (b) Every cistern for supplying water to the bakehouse must be separate and distinct from any cistern for supplying water to a watercloset; (c) A drain or pipe for carrying off faecal or sewage matter must not have an opening within the bakehouse. (2) If any person lets or suffers to be occupied or occupies any room or place as a bakehouse in contravention of this section he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding forty shillings, and to a further fine not exceeding five shillings for every day during which any room or place is so occupied after a conviction under this section. 84 Section 98.—(1) Where a court of summary jurisdiction is satisfied on the prosecution of an inspector or a district council that any room or place used as a bakehouse is in such a state as to be on sanitary grounds unfit for use or occupation as a bakehouse, the occupier of the bakehouse shall be liable to a fine not exceeding, for the first offence, forty shillings, and for any subsequent offence five pounds. (2) The court of summary jurisdiction, in addition to or instead of inflicting a fine, may order means to be adopted by the occupier, within the time named in the order, for the purpose of removing the ground of complaint. The court may, on application, enlarge the time so named, but if after the expiration of the time as originally named or enlarged by subsequent order is not complied with, the occupier shall be liable to a fine not exceeding one pound for every day that the non.compliance continues. Section 99.—(1) All the inside walls of the rooms of a bakehouse, and all the ceilings and tops of those rooms (whether those walls ceilings, or tops are plastered or not), and all the passages and staircases of a bakehouse, must either be painted with oil or varnished or be limewashed, or be partly painted or varnished and partly limewashed ; and (a) where the bakehouse is painted with oil or varnished, there must be three coats of paint or varnish, and the paint or varnish must be renewed once at least in every seven years, and must be washed with hot water and soap once at least in every six months ; and (b) where the bakehouse is limewashed, the lime. washing must be renewed once at least in every six months. (2) A bakehouse in which there is a contravention of this section shall be deemed not to be kept in conformity with this Act. 85 Section 100.—(1) A place on the same level with a bakehouse and forming part of the same building, may not be used as a sleeping place, unless it is constructed as follows: that is to say (a) is effectually separated from the bakehouse by a partition extending from the floor to the ceiling; and (b) has an external glazed window of at least nine superficial feet in area, of which at the least four and a half superficial feet are made to open for ventilation. (2) If any person let or occupies or continues to let or knowingly suffers to be occupied any place contrary to this section he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding for the first offence, twenty shillings, and for any subsequent offence five pounds. (b) Underground Bakehouses Section 101.—(1) An underground bakehouse shall not be used as a bakehouse unless it was so used at the passing of this Act. (2) Subject to the foregoing provision, after the first day of January, one thousand nine hundred and four, an underground bakehouse shall not be used unless certified by the district council to be suitable for that purpose. (3) For the purpose of this section an underground bakehouse shall mean a bakehouse, any baking room of which is so situate that the surface of the floor is more than three feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street, or of the ground adjoining or nearest to the room, The expression " baking room " means any room used for baking, or for any process incidental thereto. 86 (4) An underground bakehouse shall not be certified as suitable unless the district council is satisfied that it is suitable as regards construction, light, ventilation, and in all other respects. (5) This section shall have effect as if it were included among the provisions relating to bakehouses which are referred to in section twenty.six of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. (6) If any place is used in contravention of this section, it shall be deemed to be a workshop not kept in conformity with this Act. (7) In the event of the refusal of a certificate by the district council, the occupier of the bakehouse may, within twenty.one days from the refusal, by complaint apply to a court of summary jurisdiction, and if it appears to the satisfaction of the court that the bakehouse is suitable for use as regards construction, light, ventilation, and in all other respects, the court shall thereupon grant a certificate of suitability of the bakehouse, which shall have effect as if granted by the district council. (8) Where any place has been let as a bakehouse, and the certificate required by this section cannot be obtained unless structural alterations are made, and the occupier alleges that the whole or part of the expenses of the alterations ought to be borne by the owner, he may by complaint apply to a court of summary jurisdiction, and that court may make such order concerning the expenses or their apportionment as appears to the court to be just and equitable, under the circumstances of the case, regard being had to the terms of any contract between the parties, or in the alternative the court may, at the request of the occupier, determine the lease. 87 Section 102. As regards every retail bakehouse, the provisions of this part of this Act shall be enforced by the district council of the district in which the retail bakehouse is situate, and not by an inspector; and for the purpose of this section the medical officer of health of the district council shall have and may exercise all the powers of entry, inspection, taking legal proceedings and otherwise of an inspector. In this section the expression " retail bakehouse " means any bakehouse or place, not being a factory, the bread, biscuits or confectionery baked in which are sold, not wholesale, but by retail, in some shop or place occupied with the bakehouse. The principles which ought in my opinion to guide the Public Health Committee in dealing with underground bakehouses are two. viz.— 1. To cause the entire abolition of underground bakehouses as quickly as possible. 2. To do this with as little cost as possible to the vested interest of landlord and tenant. In putting into practice the foregoing I recommend— 1. That the bakehouses at the following addresses, which are, in my opinion, entirely unfit on sanitary grounds for use or occupation as bakehouses, should not be certified as suitable by the Local Authority. 127, "Well Street, 5, Lower Clapton Eoad, 40, Shacklewell Lane, 83, Dalston Lane, 117, Balls Pond Eoad. It will be seen on reference to the details of the inspections of these bakehouses, that their leases have almost expired, so that their 88 closure will not bear hardly against either tenant or landlord, especially, if a reasonable time is allowed to the tenants to obtain suitable premises. 2. There are certain of the remaining bakehouses, which although entirely underground are well lighted and ventilated by means of over.head lanterns and louvres, and might be certified without much alteration. The following is a list, viz.: 71, Ghatsworth Road, 186, Well Street, 33, Rectory Road, 550, Kingsland Road, 48, De Beauvoir Road. 3. For the remaining underground bakehouses I should advise as a general rule no certificate of suitability should be granted by the Local Authority unless the following conditions are observed, viz.— (a) Construction.—No underground bakehouse shall be less than 7ft. 6in. in height, measured from the floor to the ceiling, nor have a cubic capacity less than 1000 cubic feet. The walls and floor must be constructed of hard material, impervious to damp. The ceiling must be even, impermeable to damp and dust. (b) Light.—The bakehouse should be well lighted by windows opening directly into the outer air or into well lighted areas so that an official copy of the abstract of the Factory Act may be read all the year in all parts of the bakehouse between the hours of 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. 89 (c) Ventilation.—This should be sufficient, and the air supplied should be drawn directly from the outer air in such a way as to exclude street dust or dirt. (d) All other respects.—1. There should be suitable and safe means of access to the bakehouse. 2. The store for flour should be separate from the bakehouse and properly ventilated and lighted. 3. Troughs should not be fixed, but movable and provided with castors or rollers. Of course all other statutary requirements must be observed. In conclusion, having regard to the whole of the circumstances in connection with this question of underground bakehouses, and the difficulty of rendering underground bakehouses healthy as workplaces, except at a great cost to the occupier or owner, I think the Committee might consider, whether the owners of underground bakehouses of short leases might not be allowed to continue the use of the bakehouses, with a minimum amount of structural alteration, provided the Local Authority obtains an undertaking that the bakehouses will be closed at the expiration of the leases. Appended is a list of the underground bakehouses in the Borough, which number 66, together with details of their structure, means of lighting and ventilation, etc. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, J.

Public Health Department, Town Hall, Hackney, N.E. 6th May, 1903. To the Public Health Committee, Hackney Borongh Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report for the year ending 31st December, 1902. Workshops.—During the year I paid 137 first visits to workshops, 1,151 visits of re-inspection. Of these, 15 visits were prompted by complaints to the Medical Officer of Health from H.M. Factory Inspectors and other persons. I found nuisances existing on 246 premises, 177 of these nuisances I dealt with myself and can report the abatement of 154. The remaining 69 were handed over by the Medical Officer of Health to the district Sanitary Inspectors to be dealt with by them. I have served 113 intimations of nuisances, 10 final notices, 6 statutory notices, and applied for 1 summons. Of the nuisances met with, the largest number 80, were those relating to dirty premises—workrooms, passages, and w.c.'s. Next 121 in number, 37, came those relating to an unsanitary state of w.c.'s and drains. Ventilation was found deficient or not maintained in 41 workrooms. Overcrowding existed in 20 workrooms. Separate sanitary accommodation was lacking in 6 cases where members of both sexes were employed on the premises. Damp walls, ceilings, etc., were found in 19 workshops. General nuisances relating to defective conditions of yards, guttering, rain-water pipes, floors, roofs, and dustbins amounted to 43. We have now on the register 946 workshops, including 166 laundries, in which women and female young persons are employed. Workroom cards shewing the number of persons permitted in each room have been distributed to 123 workrooms. Outworkers. — The work in connection with the inspection of premises occupied by outworkers has increased very considerably during the past year. The Factory and Workshop Act of 1901, which came into force on 1st January, 1902, gave to District Councils very important powers of controlling the conditions under which certain classes of work are done in the homes of the workers. In addition to the benefits conferred upon the workers by improved sanitary surroundings, these inspections are frequently the means of bringing to light workshops which have previously escaped notice. The magnitude of this work may be judged by the fact that the outworkers resident in this district at the end of 1902 (as far as ascertained) numbered 1,600, and that this number is being almost daily increased by the receipt of further lists of workers from employers and local authorities. Of this large number I have only been able to visit 219, for a great proportion of the time I felt justified in devoting to this branch of my duty had to be given up to clerical work in connection with the registration of employers, and of the outworkers employed by them. Of course the initial work in this respect was the heaviest, but each year in February and August some considerable amount of time must be consumed in examining the lists sent in, and in the registration of new names and addresses. 122 In this district much difficulty is experienced in getting in the lists from occupiers of factories, workshops, etc., who employ outworkers. At the beginning of the year the Medical Officer of Health sent out notices setting forth the requirements of the Act, to which the greater number of employers responded by sending in their lists, but in August very few were spontaneously sent in. A limited number of employers have altogether failed to comply with this section 107 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. The outworkers living in this Borough are almost entirely employed in the manufacture of articles of wearing apparel. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ALICE TBEBAY. 123 REPORT OF CANAL BOATS INSPECTOR.
