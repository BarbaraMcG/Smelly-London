CAM 9 Appendix III. to Annual Report. bawbswell Report of the medical Officer of health. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Camberwell. Gentlemen, —The population of London at the middle of the year 1902 is estimated by the Registrar-General to be 4,579,110, and it is on this figure that he makes his calculations of the birth, marriage and death rates for the whole of the County. During the 53 weeks ending January 3rd, 1903, the births numbered 132,810, equal to a rate of 28.5 per thousand. In 1901 it was 29 0, so that the decline which commenced in 1896 has gone on since that year; indeed that for 1902 is the lowest London birth rate recorded. The marriages numbered 40,817 as compared with 40,010 in the previous year. The deaths registered in London were 82,540, corresponding to an uncorrected rate of 17'7 per thousand; the average rate in the ten previous years having been 19'2 per thousand. In my report last year I alluded to the difficulty experienced in making an estimate of the population of the various sub-districts, and especially that of St. George's. During the period 1896-1901, owing to the demolition of a considerable number of houses, and also, it is to be hoped, in consequence of the action of this Council in the diminution of overcrowding that undoubtedly existed in certain parts of this district, the population showed a decrease. Even allowing for a large amount of emigration from this neighbourhood, the excess of births over deaths would imply that this diminution has not continued during the past year, but that the population has again begun to increase. For the purpose of this district, the ordinary methods of calculation not being available, I have taken the number of assessments and have multiplied them by the average number of inhabitants for the only three complete wards in this sub-district that I have been able to ascertain. It will thus be evident that the death rates, for the sub-districts especially, are more than usually hypothetical, and the figures shown can only be regarded as approximately correct. So far as the whole Borough is concerned I have followed the plan adopted in former years of assuming that the population has increased at the same rate as it did in the intercensal period 1896-1901.

The deaths of those parishioners of St. Saviour's Union which occurred in the Infirmary of that parish at East Dulwich, and those of persons who, although they died in the Workhouse or Lunatic Asylums within this Borough, had been brought from districts outside its limits, of course have been excluded, but the deaths of those who were removed from within Camberwell to hospitals or other public institutions without the Borough are included. The deaths of parishioners occurring in hospitals, etc., outside the Borough have been re-distributed according to the sub-districts whence they were removed wherever we have been able to get the requisite information, and a similar plan has been followed out with regard to those that took place in the Infirmary, Workhouses and Lunatic Asylums. But there are some instances where this information as to previous address is lacking, and when this has been so the deaths have been considered separately and have been re-distributed among the sub-districts in the due proportion to their recorded deaths. The re-distribution of these Infirmary deaths is especially necessary so far as regards Camberwell sub-district, in which the Infirmaries are chiefly situated, and where the registered deaths are greatly in excess of the rest of the Borough, and which, if uncorrected, would create an altogether false impression of the healthiness of this district. Table D—Re-distribution of Deaths among the Sub-Districts of Camberwell. After all these calculations and subtractions have been made, the total number of deaths to be dealt with for the purpose of calculating the death-rate amounts, as stated above, to 4,272, making a death-rate for Camberwell of 16.34. Although the whole Borough thus shows a decrease of .15 per thousand compared with 1901, the individual sub-districts, with the exception of Peckham, all show an increase on the previous year. But it is the considerable lessening of the figures for this latter division that brings down the rate for the whole Borough. Table E—Death Rates in Camberwell and its Sub-Districts. Borough.

While recognising the fact that the death rate of any district is affected by many varying influences, and hence must not always be taken as an absolute standard of the healthiness or otherwise of any given district, we are justified in considering to some extent its gradual diminution as an important sign of the improvement in the conditions under which its inhabitants exist. It appears from the above that there has been a gradual diminution since 1899, while compared with the other South London Boroughs, Camberwell by no means occupies an unfavourable position.

The extra mortality was chiefly confined to Camberwell. Measles was the direct cause of 109 deaths, a smaller number than in 1901. This year again the disease was most fatal in Peckham, nearly half the deaths having occurred in that district. The mortality from hooping cough was greater than my previous report has shown, there being 97 deaths, the three more thickly populated districts showing about equal numbers. The actual numbers do not, however, show to the full extent the baleful influence of these two diseases, for tuberculosis not infrequently follows them both with sometimes a rapid course, while on the other hand bronchitis and pneumonia are often the sequela of these two diseases. The mortality from smallpox was unusually heavy, and except as regards the Dulwich district it was nearly uniformly distributed. The subject has been already dealt with in my special report on the epidemic; but I cannot forbear calling attention to the fact that Camberwell, Peckham and St. George's were all nearly equally involved, and the disease was by no means specially prevalent in the least sanitary districts. The total number of notifications received by me was 3,033. Excluding duplicates, this number represents 2,789 actual cases. The chicken-pox notifications, which amounted to 1,493, are not included in the above total, for the reason that no disinfection was carried out after their occurrence and that their inclusion in the list was a special circumstance. I visited the majority of them, and although, as set out in my report, some of them were found to be smallpox the greater majority were true cases of varicella, although certain other maladies were confounded with this. Of scarlet fever there were 1,306, compared with 1,443 in 1901; 1,126 of these were of persons over one year old but under 15. Beyond a slightly increased prevalence in St. George's, there is no great difference from 1901, at . the same time the mortality showed a slight decline from that year. The diphtheria notifications were nearly 200 less than last year, all the districts sharing in the reduction, while the deaths fell from 110 to 77, the drop being especially noticeable in Peckham, which still, however, had the greatest number of fatalities. There was 110 particular school that might be singled out, although in several instances we had the familiar history of a child being ill with slight sore throat while attending school, and a few weeks later a number of cases of diphtheria from the same department. As in previous years, I have not considered the question of bacterial virulence or non-virulence, but have always considered a throat containing the specific bacillus of diphtheria as being capable of spreading the disease, and that children should not be allowed to return to school until the bacteriological examination is negative. That this is the right course from the public health point of view I am convinced, until we know the nature of the other factor, whatever it may be, whether association of other organisms, &c., which will at one time render the bacillus able to manifest its evil power and give rise to an attack of diphtheria. The mortality works out at about 11.7 per cent, of notifications, a rate lower than any year since this calculation has been made. Notifications and Case Mortality of Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever.

During the year considerable attention has been paid to the possibility of the contagion of enteric fever being conveyed by means of shellfish, especially those that are eaten in the raw state, such as oysters. There were four instances in this Borough where the disease was possibly contracted from this cause ; two of these had been on a visit to Southend, another ate them in Brixton, while a fourth stated that he had eaten winkles at Southend some four weeks before the onset of illness. Others were unable to give any definite statement so far as regards the question of shellfish, beyond the fact that they occasionally partook of them, while a third category attributed the illness to water-cress, ice creams, bad smells, etc. The solitary notification of typhus was not really that disease, but eventually turned out to be smallpox. No cases were reported to me of relapsing fever, continued fever, cholera or plague. The greater proportion of the infectious diseases were removed to hospital. The deaths from consumption for the year 1902 were twenty more than in 1901, while there was an increase of three in the mortality from tuberculous diseases. So far as the former is concerned Peckham has slightly the largest number of fatal cases, but not to the extent that existed last year. Fifty-three rooms, etc., where consumptives had been living were disinfected, although a circular letter offering this measure was sent in each instance that a death occurred in a private house. Among the diseases which are not usually classed as infectious the first in importance is cancer, under which heading are included all forms of malignant new growths. There were 245 deaths from this disease in 1902, 44 more than in the previous year. It may be perhaps supposed from the comparatively high number of deaths in Dulwich, that there is some local condition which is favourable to the contraction of this disease; but last year there were only 7 deaths in this district, moreover, there is a larger proportion of people of advanced middle age in Dulwich than, say, St. George's, and at this age cancer is more prevalent than in early life. Next year I hope to be able to give some results of an inquiry I am making into the antecedents of all the deaths from this disease for the past five years. There were only four deaths caused by the various forms of septic troubles arising in connection with child-birth, compared with 13 in 1901. A very marked fall took place in the mortality from diarrhoea due to the climatic conditions, which were for the greater part of the summer unfavourable to the spread of this disease. There were nearly double as many suicides as there were in 1901, and it may be that the weather of last year, which was inimical to diarrhoea mortality, favoured those conditions of mind which lead frequently to suicide. With the epidemic of smallpox that lasted from October, 1901, up to July, 1902, I have already dealt with at some length, and it only remains for me to mention two other cases that occurred in Peckham. The first one to be attacked was a boy of 18, who was employed as a caddie at the golf ground at the Honor Oak Club. He had been walking about with the rash out, for a. week before a doctor was called in. He was removed to hospital on September 29th, 1902. On October 8th his mother was attacked and removed to hospital, where she died on the 15th of the same month. No other instances occurred, a curious faet, when the number of persons is considered with whom the boy must have come in contact. The Council on June 18th passed a resolution authorising the use of a cottage situated at Peckham Park Road Depot as a shelter for persons who are temporarily turned out of their houses while disinfection is being carried out. This has been fitted up with baths, and accommodation for use both by day and by night. Up to the present date it has not been occupied, but at any time the necessity for its use may arise. During the year many applications have been made to the Committee for dispensation from some of the requirements of the County Council By-laws, made by that body for the more uniform carrying out of new drainage work. These applications have related more especially to the provision of heavy material for the ventilation of the soil pipes, it being alleged that in many cases the walls of old buildings would not carry the specified weight. In many cases your Committee has considered the requirement to be impracticable, and has dispensed the owners accordingly. On January 14th your Committee received the following report from the Borough Engineer and myself, in which we both agree that this is one of the most satisfactory ways of dealing with the difficult problem of sewer ventilators in London, in those instances where we cannot get the permission of the owners to run special shafts up the walls of their houses, and one which will minimize the nuisance so frequently complained of from the sewer ventilators in the roadway. The shafts are not usually ornamental to buildings, although they have the advantage of being in active use during storms, when need of the ventilation of the sewer is at its height, and when the rainwater pipes are in full use. To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, —We have jointly considered the question as to the disconnection of rain water pipes in the course of systematic inspections. We think that where the top of these rain water pipes is situated at a safe distance from all the neighbouring windows the disconnection should not be carried out, but that they should remain to act as ventilating pipes. Their existence in this connected condition must not be held to obviate the necessity for providing other means of ventilating the sewer or drains, our object being that they should supplement these and not do away with them. A " safe distance " from windows we should consider to be, that they should conform with the provisions relating to the position of soil ventilating pipes laid down in the By-laws made by the London County Council in 1893. We are, Gentlemen, your obedient servants, FRANCIS STEVENS, Medical Officer of Health. WILLIAM OXTOBY, Borough Engineer. On one occasion during the year the question of proceedings being taken under the Public Health Act, 1891, against parents who had failed to give the names of all the schools attended by the inmates of the house was considered, but in the opinion of the Committee the evidence was not sufficiently strong to justify any legal proceedings being taken, and there does not appear to be any penalty under the Act for failing to give such information or for not giving it accurately. On January 22nd I reported to the Council as follows :— " A secondary case of smallpox occurred where a patient had been taken away 14 days previously. It was that of a woman who was the only one in the house not to follow my advice as regards re-vaccination, her reason being the usual one—she was not afraid of attack. The lack of fear, however, does not appear to have an equal value to re-vaccination. " The results have been in this Borough, as in all others, so strongly in favour of vaccination as a protection against infection by smallpox, that I think the Council is incurring a heavy responsibility in not issuing posters or placards, as advised in my report of October the 16th last, calling attention to the necessity of vaccination and re-vaccination. " I should further recommend that the Borough Council ask the Guardians to give instructions to their vaccination officers to inspect children in the public elementary schools of the Borough, with a view to ascertaining whether these have been vaccinated or re-vaccinated. The consent of the proper authorities of each school would, of course, have to be obtained; however, I understand from the Local Government Board Inspector that there is no difficulty in getting the necessary authorisation from these bodies." This portion of my report was referred back to the Committee, who on February 5th brought up a recommendation which was adopted by the Council, that a leaflet should be distributed, pointing out the various means to be taken in combating the disease. On September 17th the following was considered by the Public Health Committee:— Town Hall, Camberwell, September 8th, 1902. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Camberwell. Gentlemen, —The Managers of the Asylums Board have been considering the question of the provision of a service alternative to that of the river for the conveyance of smallpox patients, and the matter has been brought to this Council by a report of the Medical Officer of Health for Paddington to this Authority, in which he points out the expense of the proceeding, and advises that a railway transport scheme should be considered if any change is to be made in the existing arrangements. As the result of this report the Paddington Borough Council sent out invitations to all the other London Authorities inviting them to join in sending a letter to the Local Government Board to ask that body to refuse its consent to the proposals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. The subject of course again came before the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and they issued a memorandum, in which they point out that they do not intend to appoint the enormous staff, &c., that has been foreshadowed by the Medical Officer of Health for Paddington. They state that they merely wish to provide an alternative means of transport, in the event of the river service not being available through fog or other weather conditions. This, in their opinion, would necessitate the acquisition of land for the purpose of a halting place on the road, and which would provide a halfway house for the omnibuses on the way to and from Gore Farm. The adoption of this course would mean that in smallpox times there would be a house, or at least a house of call for smallpox ambulances, presumably infected by smallpox, established on the line of route. This, to my mind, is undesirable, and if any change is to be made it would be far better to adopt such methods of transport which would do away with the necessity of a resting-place on the high road. The Managers are, as at present constituted, responsible for this transport between London and the ships, and, of course, can make any arrangements they please; but to embark on any acquisition of land and material for the prevention of conditions which only arise occasionally in cases of smallpox epidemics, which are themselves but infrequent seems an expensive and useless proceeding. The Metropolitan Asylums Board further lay stress on the desirability that London should be cleared day by day of smallpox, and in this, of course, all would concur ; but that it would be a danger to the public health if the cases were aggregated at the shelters pending the changing of the weather I do not believe. The idea as to the dangerous nature of this proceeding is probably dependent on the theory that areas around hospitals are specially liable to attack in spite of their complete isolation, that is, that the disease would be aerially conveyed. This is, or certainly was, the view of the Local Government Board, but it is not by any means proved, and there are some exceedingly powerful arguments against it. Finally, the Managers complain of the action of Dr. Dudfield. He may have, perhaps, misunderstood their proposal, but as a ratepayer I think he has done a public service by calling attention to the matter ; and, in recommending his Council to appeal in opposition to the scheme to the Local Government Board, he will have forced the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board to prove and establish their position, and not allow them to rush into a hastily formed and ill-digested scheme which will lead to the waste of public money. I am, Gentlemen, your obedient servant, FRANCIS STEVENS, Medical Officer of Health. The Council decided on September 24th to ask the Local Government Board to hold such inquiry. As a result of the interest aroused by the holding in London in 1901 of the international Congress for the Prevention of Tuberculosis, various means devised for the lessening of this disease have been brought prominently before both the sanitary authorities throughout the country and the public. In several districts of London phthisis has been made voluntarily notifiable, i.e., the Borough Councils have agreed to pay a certain sum, usually half-a-crown, for each case of phthisis notified by a medical practitioner, but they have not put into operation the compulsory sections to this effect of the Public Health (London) Act. I have before declared my opinion as adverse to the idea of benefit being obtained by notification of phthisis, and so far I have seen no reason for altering that view, although I feel that I am at present on the unpopular side. It may be well to consider the advantages of notification. They comprise the localising of the cases of the disease, thereby discovering anything likely to be a cause of the disease in the lodging or circumstances of the patient, and the taking of subsequent measures, designed to prevent its spread. In this connection notification enables the public health authority to take up the work of tracing the infection and also ascertaining the part played in the spread of disease by occupation or residence. This latter might be advanced as an argument for compulsory notification, but it would give rise to absolutely false conclusions if only a certain number of cases were reported and inquired into, as they would be were notification only voluntary. The whole value of notification of any disease rests on the early recognition and reporting of the cases, a fact that can readily be seen if we study the history of those diseases which have been notifiable since the beginning of 1892. We shall see that neither scarlet fever nor diphtheria have shown a marked diminution in prevalence although they have in mortality; while diseases such as smallpox, which are more often recognised in the initial stages, have been much more brought under control. In the same way if enteric fever be notified early it may be possible to prevent the distribution of the milk that is liable to be contaminated with the specific poison; to obviate the infection of the water supply, and in many other directions. In the case, however, of phthisis we have .a disease of totally different character in that it pursues a chronic course, and may for some time present merely the ordinary signs of a cough, or which may only appear to be a case of gradually failing health, yet which, during this time must be giving off large amounts of the specific micro-organism; and, from the purely bacteriological point of view, be spreading the disease far and wide. It is fair to suppose notification would in most cases not be made until the disease had made marked progress. I cannot help repeating what I have inferred above, viz., that the consensus of opinion among medical officers of health appears to be in favour of the notification of phthisis, which, quoting the resolutions passed at the Tuberculosis Congress, "has been attended by a, promising measure of success and should be encouraged in districts in which XIII. efficient sanitary administration renders it possible to adopt the consequential measures." Granted that notification is carried out, this must be supplemented by other measures if an attempt is to be made on these lines to extinguish the disease. Disinfection of the houses and rooms will have to be carried out at frequent intervals, and instructions will have to be given to the patient with regard to spitting, or any other practice which has been supposed by the advocates of the frequency of personal infection conducive to the spread of the disease. But these instructions will not be of much avail unless we are in the position to see that they are carried out, and how this is to be done without the constant supervision of a sanitary inspector or some one in authority I fail to see. With the questions of notification and disinfection is bound up that of isolation—in the case of phthisis, of course, by means of sanatoria. Opinions apparently differ as to whether early or late isolation is the more important. Hillier, in a paper read before the Medical Officers' Society, in January, 1903, quotes Koch as emphasising the necessity for the provision of an asylum for the late cases ; while from the point of view of cure the early ones are more in need of attention. But here it is difficult to say whether the disease has healed up for the remainder of the patient's life, or whether the morbid process has been merely checked and is lying dormant ready to light up again when it is exposed to unhealthy conditions. That in the great majority of cases this is what happens I do not for one moment doubt. "It is," said Koch, " the victim of consumption, who, after, say, some months· in a general hospital (finding himself rather worse than better) goes home to die, who is the most terrible source of further infection. You speak of education in the sanatoria, and for the early cases which recover this is of the utmost practical value, but for the dying man in his cottage home, how can it serve ? The last three or four weeks of life are the most deadly in the spread of infection. The man dies at last, but the education in him dies before him ; his every cough, sneeze, or effort of speech sends forth a spray laden with bacilli in virulent form, deadly to the poor wife and children around him. It is not cruelty to isolate these cases ; it is the truest and highest kindness. Let their days be made as pleasant as ingenuity can make them. Let them in some airy ward or open liege halle receive visits from their friends even in these last days, but let them go to the grave with the consolation of knowing that they are not handing on a legacy of tragedy to those they leave behind. " In all other infectious diseases we attack infection at its source; cases of smallpox, of leprosy, of diphtheria, of plague, are isolated, but cases of tuberculosis in their last stages, the most deadly stage of the most deadly disease of all, are still allowed throughout Europe to spread further infection broadcast in the midst of their already destitute families. This fact does not yet seem to be learned. "When it is, and when we have these homes (for the hopeless cases) adjoining every city, then tuberculosis will pass from the midst of us." According to this view the attack by this disease of relatives in houses where consumption has occurred should show out prominently, but so far as Camberwell is concerned I have found nothing to lead me to believe that this happens with any frequency. That phthisis has vastly diminished of late years is demonstrable from statistics, but that this diminution is due to the measures which have been taken, on the hypothesis of the great direct infectivity of phthisis, for its notification, disinfection, &c., I have not seen any direct proof; indeed, the decrease of mortality commenced in England long before any of these measures were thought of. It is stated that in Prussia the only decline in the mortality from tuberculosis shown by the records has occurred since 1888; and this is co-incident with the taking of precautions even among the lowest classes in Germany, together with the bringing into operation of the workmen's sick insurance laws, and with the establishment of sanatoria, which is also set out as a prophylactic measure, but of too recent date to be quoted with certainty. But to ensure the validity of this argument it must be proved that other diseases, particularly those dependent on defective hygienic surroundings, such as enteric fever, have shown no such corresponding diminution during the period referred to. If they, on the other hand, have shared in the decrease it may reasonably be argued that it is to the improved conditions under which people live that we must look for an explanation of decreased mortality rather than to measures devised directly against the infective agent itself. There is, however, one aspect of the question on which I have not touched, that is the importance, according to present knowledge, of the safe-guarding of our milk supply, in spite of the views enunciated by distinguished observers as to the non-transmissibility of bovine tuberculosis to man. The London County Council has made a partial application of certain sections of the Public Health (London) Act with regard to measles. There is no reason why a similar application of a particular section should not be made for the purposes of tuberculosis. I refer to that one which if applied would give the Medical Officer of Health power to inspect the animals in any dairy whence milk has been supplied to his district, which milk is found to contain tubercle bacilli, on the ground that this source of supply is likely to cause infectious disease, i.e., phthisis, to persons residing within its limits. I think, in the future, those measures which will render people less liable to the attack of the tubercle bacillus, rather than those directed to the destruction of the bacillus itself will prove of the greater benefit. Insanitary conditions generally, in the widest application of the term, have more to do with phthisis than with any other disease, and it is to the increased attention paid to such matters that we are largely indebted for the decreased mortality; and if we can only get people to recognise the value of light, of fresh air and dry houses, we shall advance a long stage towards its diminution. The necessity too becomes more apparent for the provision in the crowded centres of open spaces, for phthisis has always been most prevalent in those districts where there is the greatest aggregation of the population. It will be remembered that in May last, Mr. Gower, the Chief Clerk in the department, left the service of the Council, and a re-arrangement took place in the office, Mr. Chadderton, one of the Sanitary Inspectors, being appointed to the Chief Clerkship, and a new Sanitary Inspector being appointed to take his place, the change of duties taking effect in November last. Up to that time, Messrs. Wright, Worsfold and Hurst had performed the clerical duties for the six months, and I am pleased to say that although no headway was made in bringing up arrears there was no fresh accumulation of back work. I have also to express my thanks for the way the Council received my proposal with regard to the increase of the Staff, for I think I may say that we are now properly equipped, and the increase in numbers I hope will shew its effect in the work of the department and prove its benefits during the present and future years. The Public Health Staff now consists of a Chief Clerk and five others, eleven male inspectors and one female, and one inspector to carry out the provisions of the Food and Drugs Acts. The Council also resolved that another male inspector be appointed, but this appointment was held over pending some definite decision with regard to the future supervision of the drainage of new buildings. Tables VII. and VIII. give the work of your Inspectors, arranged in tabular form under the classification of each Inspector, and also of the nature of the work. The house-to-house inspections amounted to 5,968, as compared with 6,494 in 1901. The complaints numbered 917, as against 980 in the previous year, while the inspections that were necessary for ascertaining the truth or otherwise of the complaints amounted to 1,376. These two items are accordingly decreased in comparison, but there is a large increase in the visits to new buildings and those to tenements and to houses let in lodgings, also in the number of re-inspections made after infectious disease; the reinspections on the other hand show a considerable decrease. Last year, however, was not an ordinary year, as must be seen by a reference to the enormous amount of work necessitated by the smallpox outbreak. The only addition to the list of last year is that of overcrowding. As a result of the inspections made on account of the above reason it was found necessary to serve 4,893 intimations under the Public Health Act, followed up by 1,203 notices served under authority from the Public Health Committee, and of these 488 related to houses let in lodgings. Further, in the case of 63 premises it was found necessary to serve summonses. Of these 33 were withdrawn on account of the work having been done, while in 30 cases an order was made. Factory and Workshops Act. This Act, which came into force on January Ist, 1902, brings the supervision of workshops and workplaces under the control of the district council. The chief points for which we are responsible are bakehouses, the sanitary condition of workshops, workplaces (in which the kitchens of restaurants wisely have been held to be included) and laundries. With regard to bakehouses, the whole subject is still under the consideration of your Committee. They have decided to visit all the bakehouses, firstly, with a view of drawing up some regulations which shall apply to all bakehouses ; and secondly, with a view of pointing out to those responsible the particular direction in which such regulations shall apply in the case of any individual bakehouse. The points that particularly need attention, so far as structures are concerned, are the conditions of the walls, the ceilings and the floors ; the provision of a proper water supply and of proper light and ventilation; these subjects are being considered in especial matter by your Committee in addition to other sanitary requirements. The inspections made of bakehouses by myself and the Inspectors amounted to 455. Fifty eating houses were inspected, and it was found necessary to serve 12 intimation notices in respect of such inspections. In one case it was found that the w.c. opened out of the very small kitchen of the eating-house. Of the eating-houses, 17 were clean, 21 in a fair condition, while 12 were dirty. There have been 149 inspections of workshops by Miss Bevan, and 490 re-inspections while there were 10 in regard to factories. In 64 instances it was necessary to demand certain improvements. A register is now kept of outworkers, and every morning as the list of notifications of infectious diseases is made out it is referred to her and she goes through this to see if any are included in the register, and if so the respective Medical Officers of Health are written to. 647 outworkers were also visited, and of these it was found that work was being done on dirty premises in 43 instances. There were 314 inspections of workshops made by the male Inspectors, together with 216 of laundries. 20 new and 184 old were inspected, such inspections needing the serving of 42 intimation notices. The difficulty lies chiefly with the small laundries owned by persons of limited means, and who are put to great straits to carry out even the most essential improvements. Before concluding this Report I wish to express my thanks to the Staff for the help they have always so cheerfully given. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, FRANCIS STEVENS, Medical Officer of Health. TABLE I.

Condon Street Improvements Conference. Report of a Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils, convened by the Camberivell Borough Council, for the ]purpose of considering the varied treatment of Metropolitan Borough Councils by the London County Council in fixing the amounts of the local and county contributions towards the cost of improvements carried out in London. To this Conference, convened upon the motion of Councillor J. R. Tomkins, under the circumstances set forth on page 72 of this Report, the following 23 Boroughs appointed delegates:—Bermondsey, Bethnal Green, Camberwell, Chelsea, Deptford, Finsbury, Greenwich, Hackney, Hammersmith, Hampstead, Islington, Kensington, Lambeth, Lewisham, Paddington, Poplar, Shoreditch, Stepney, St. Marylebone, St. Pancras, Wandsworth, Westminster and Woolwich. An exhaustive return, showing in detail the cost of and the contributories to every street improvement in London since 1889, of which return the accompanying table is a summary, was prepared by the Town Clerk of Camberwell from the official reports of the London County Council, and placed before the Conference, together with other material. Two meetings were held at the Town Hall, Camberwell, on Thursday, March 19th, and Thursday, April 23rd, 1903. The Conference appointed The Worshipful the Mayor of Camberwell (Councillor Goddard Clarke, J.P., L.C.C.), Chairman, and Mr. C. William Tagg, Town Clerk of Camberwell, Secretary. At the first meeting a Committee was appointed to consider what principle the Conference should ask the London County Council to adopt with reference to improvements, and to consider any other suggestions which the delegates might desire to make. The following gentlemen formed the Committee, viz.:—Alderman MacGregor, St. Pancras ; Councillor Irons, Chelsea; Alderman Tyler, Bermondsey; Councillor Dickson (The Mayor), Deptford; Councillor Tomkins, Camberwell ; Councillor Hunter, Woolwich; Councillor Lorden, Wandsworth; Councillor Cox, Westminster; Mr. W. Chambers Leete, Kensington; Alderman Glasier, Hammersmith; Mr. J. Rush Dixon, Shoreditch; and Mr. A. W. J. Eussell, Paddington; and the Chairman and Secretary ex-officio. Several meetings were held, and the result of the deliberations presented to the Conference at its meeting on April 23rd, 1903. After clue consideration, the Conference passed the following resolutions: — General. Resolved—(a) That the present system, whereby the London County Council claims from the Metropolitan Borough Councils contributions on varying bases for similar improvements, is contrary to the practice which should prevail in the Metropolis. Resolved - (6) That having regard to the rapid growth of London and the consequent increase in traffic, and to the necessity for some uniform practice being adopted, this Conference do now consider upon what principle it is prepared to recommend that the cost of London improvements should be borne. County Improvements. Resolved —(c) That the principle of treating London as a whole and of systematically selecting improvements best calculated to provide relief to the main thoroughfares, as advocated by a Select Committee of Parliament in 1871, should at once be formulated by the London County Council in a definite and comprehensive scheme for all future county improvements, and upon which London should equally contribute upon rateable value. Tramway Improvements. Resolved—(d) That in all thoroughfares in which tramways are or may be constructed, a width of not less than 54 feet should be provided, and the total cost of widening borne by the London County Council, either out of the Tramways Account or the County Bate. Local Improvements. Resolved—(e) That contributions to local authorities for local improvements should be, as far as possible, on a uniform basis. Resolved —(f) That copies of these resolutions be forwarded to the Metropolitan Borough Councils for their consideration and observation, and that this Conference do stand adjourned until the replies of the Borough Councils are received. At the time of going to press with this report the Conference had not met for consideration of the replies received. GODDARD CLARKB (Mayor), Chairman. J. R. TOMKINS, Chairman of Committee. C.

Appendix VI. to Annual Report. Address by the £adp £langatlock on the occasion of the Opening of the Passmore Edwards North Cumberwell Public Library on May 18th, 190-3. Ms. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, — When you paid me the compliment of inviting me to take part in the proceedings of this day, I felt at once that I should like to be here this evening, because I regarded your invitation as one from friends to a friend, for we are certainly not unknown to each other, for I have not forgotten that you did me the honour of giving me the opportunity of taking part in the interesting ceremony, two years ago, when I had the privilege of laying the foundation stone of this building together with that great and generous benefactor to mankind, Mr. Passmore Edwards, by whose generosity this beautiful Free Library has been erected. Some of you may, perhaps, remember the storm of thunder, lightning and rain we had during that ceremony, and my quoting the old Scotch proverb (being Scotch myself) that " What begins in rain, ends in sunshine." Now I feel this proverb has proved true and that this building will bring sunshine to the lives of the people who are shortly going to make use of it. I scarcely need to say how pleased I am to be here, and I most heartily congratulate the inhabitants of this district on the completion of this great and good work and of the possession of a building that contains a Free Library, Baths and Wash-houses, where rest and refreshment of the mind and of the body, after toiling during the day, can be obtained, and where their leisure time can be passed in comfort. I feel we have to-day reached the crowning act of our aspiration and ambition in the erection of these buildings, and I am very pleased and thankful to know that so much has been accomplished to benefit the working man and woman who cannot afford books in his or her own home. When life is hard and troubles are many, we cannot too highly prize all institutions where rest may be found, and where healthy social recreation may be enjoyed and where labour may be lightened by sympathy. It has been well said that books are " the legacy of genius," and certainly they are our lasting friends. When worldly occupations have passed away they remain as valuable as ever; friends may grow cold and unsympathetic, but books remain the same to cheer and comfort us with that true friendship which cannot deceive or desert us. I have read that the history of libraries is of great antiquity. The remains of the earliest known were discovered in 1843 by Sir Henry Layard at Nineveh, which consisted of tablets of baked clay dated 1700 B.C. In a tomb of one of the kings of Egypt, a manuscript on papyrus (from which we got the idea of our paper) mentions that the first Public Library was founded by Pisistratus at Athens 540 B.C. Another was founded by Ptolemy, 284 8.C., which unfortunately was partially burnt when Julius Caesar set fire to Alexandria, at which time 400,000 manuscripts were said to have been destroyed. What a sad loss to us, and to the world ! Fortunately many most valuable additions to knowledge in Hebrew and Greek manuscripts lay hidden in monasteries in the middle ages, including the priceless preservation of the Old and New Testament. It was only in the 15th century that the works of the great historian, Tacitus, were discovered in Italy, which have been since a foundation of our knowledge of the most powerful period of the Roman Empire, from Tiberius to Domitian, and contains a tract about early England which gave us materials for modem philosophic history and municipal character of our country under the Roman law. Free Libraries have been introduced in England since 1872, when the great Guildhall Library was opened free, and since then there have sprung up several in all parts of England, many being presented by the energy and generosity of Mr. Passmore Edwards and Mr. Carnegie. I have also heard that formerly, when private libraries were scarce, gentlemen used to bring boxes of books to each other's houses for mutual pleasure and information, thereby making a private circulating library. ow the wealth and magnificent interest contained in private libraries is untold, though unfortunately many of the most valuable, such as Sir Robert Peel's, the Ashburnham, Althorpe and others have been dispersed. The hard-working man, the loving student and the distressed may all find comfort and unmixed pleasure and profit in a library. I may indeed quote Southey's pretty lines in the " Golden Treasury of Songs and Lyrics," when alluding to the friendship of books— " My constant friends are they, with whom I converse night and day." Dr. .Johnson said—" When the exuberance of youth is passed and decline of life is felt, then we like a little solitude to renew our friendship with our books." I earnestly desire that this Free Library, Baths and Wash-houses will prove, not only a blessing, but a pleasure and comfort to all in this neighbourhood. I am sure we are most grateful to those who have been concerned in the erection of this building, which I hear has cost the large sum of £26,000. lam pleased and proud to say it stands on the land given by my husband, and not far from this ground is St. George's Church on land given by! my husband's grandfather, so this ground has a double interest to me, and with my personal good wishes for its success I now declare this building open.
