(Resigned 9.10.61). —Miss S. A. Davies (Appointed 9.10.61). 4 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Erith Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1961 which has been prepared on the lines set out in Circular 1/61 of the Ministry of Health. The Registrar-General's estimate of the mid-year population is 45,050 (45,780 in 1960). The vital statistics supplied annually by the General Register Office indicate that the general trend of the health of the Borough remains satisfactory. The standardised death rate was 13.48 per 1,000 of the home population (11.63 in 1960) compared with 12.0 per 1,000 for England and Wales. The standardised birth rate was 15.62 per 1,000 home poulation (15.73 in 1960) compared with a rate of 17.4 per 1,000 for the country as a whole. The number of infants who died during the first year of life was 10 (14 in 1960) giving an infant mortality rate of 14.35 per 1,000 live births (19.44 in 1960) compared with 21.6 per 1,000 for England and Wales. For the third successive year there was no maternal death associated with childbirth. Considering that during the past three years there were 2,106 total births in the Borough it may be said that the antenatal and obstetrical services in the area have worked to a high standard of efficiency. For the twelfth year in succession there has been no case of diphtheria in the Borough. There is no evidence, however, from the fatality rate of cases occurring in other parts of the country that there has been any waning of the virulence of this disease and despite the good record of the Borough, immunisation against this disease remains a matter of great importance. For the third year in succession no case of polimyelitis occurred in the Borough. The availability of the Sabin oral vaccine and the full co-operation of the public in accepting vaccination for all priority groups could well ensure a high degree of freedom from this disease in the years to come. During 1961 there were 28 deaths from cancer of the lung in the Borough (39 in 1960). It has become a duty to reiterate the proven association between this disease and heavy cigarette smoking and, indeed, with atmospheric pollution in general. The recent report of the Royal College of 5 Physicians on Smoking and Health has brought this matter to the forefront as one of the outstanding public health problems of the day and some beneficial results may already be discerned. One example of this is the agreement which has been reached between the Independent Television Authority and the tobacco industry to secure modifications that will include the avoidance of those aspects of advertising which make a special appeal to young people. The smoking habit is so deeply ingrained as to appear almost ineradicable but, nevertheless, the issue must be kept alive by all who are responsible for the education and health of the younger generation. During the year 100 deaths were attributed to disease of the coronary arteries and angina pectoris, this being the largest number ever recorded in the Borough in any one year. This disease has increased in all western countries since World War I and, despite an enormous amount of research into the causes of this phenomenon, very little new information has emerged. It is likely, however, that a number of factors associated with our modern civilisation operate together to form a pattern of living which tends towards the production of this disease. Overeating generally and, particularly, a diet with a high animal fat content, sedentary habits with lack of regular exercise, oversmoking and hereditary factors have all been blamed, probably with good cause, but the exact mechanism that brings about the coronary accident remains hidden. Can there be much doubt, however, that coronary thrombosis is part of the price we pay for the high standard of living which we now enjoy ? The Home Safety Act, 1961 empowers the councils of county districts to promote home safety by giving information and advice on the prevention of accidents in the home but county councils have, for many years, had this power under Section 28 of the National Health Service Act, 1946. Since 1959, the Kent County Council have made a grant to the Bexley, Erith and Crayford Home Safety Committee through The councils concerned which has facilitated this work in recent years. The new Act will enable the three authorities to determine more fully the future development of this important aspect of health education and the decision to appoint a part-time Home Safety Organiser to work under the Medical Officer of Health will, it is hoped, result in a more sustained and effective campaign against accidents in the nome than has been possible heretofore. A Speakers Training Day was held on May 5th, 1961 during a fortnight of intensive home safety propaganda, details of which are set out in 'he report. 6 Reference is made on page 31 to the progress which has been made in the implementation of the Council's Smoke Control Order No. 1. At the time of writing all arrangements have been made to obtain estimates of the work required to be carried out, from householders, and in a number of cases, works of adaption have commenced. Reference is also made on page 53 to the progress which has been made in the Borough in connection with the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1960. This important aspect of the work of the Health Department received considerable attention during the year and it may not be entirely unconnected that only one notification of food poisoning was received during 1961 (two in I960). The time is rapidly approaching when the implementation of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Local Government in the Greater London Area will bring about a major change in the local administration of the health and welfare services. Much thought and energy will be required to meet both the challenge and the opportunity which lie ahead. As this is the last Annual Report likely to be published prior to the retirement of Mr. L. E. King, Chief Public Health Inspector, on completion of 43 years Local Government service, including more than 25 years service as Chief Public Health Inspector of Erith, I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for the invaluable service which he has rendered to the Health Department and to the Borough as a whole, for over a quarter of a century. In conclusion I wish to thank the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their support and encouragement and the Chief Public Health Inspector. Chief Clerk and all members of the Health Department for the good work which has been done during the year. I am, Your obedient servant, JOHN LANDON Medical Officer of Health. 7 Annual Report 1961 SECTION A:—STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA A (1) Physical Situation and Amenities Erith is situated in the north-west corner of Kent, and is bounded on the north-east by the River Thames to which it has a frontage of about 4 miles: on the west by the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich and the Borough of Bexley, and on the south by the Borough of Bexley and the Urban District of Cray ford. The shopping facilities are advantageously situated having regard to the disposition of the six wards in the Borough, and there is a copious supply of pure water which is provided and maintained by the Metropolitan Water Board. The chief industries are light engineering, edible oil refining, manufacture of chemicals, coal shipping and lighterage, and the production of building materials, i.e. stoneware drain pipes and asbestos components. The manufacture of television and radio equipment, and toys, are also well established industries. As in other years, industrial expansion has continued. 8 A (2) Comparative Rainfall 1960 1961 Month Inches Month Inches January 1.90 January 2.51 February 1.51 February 1.93 March 1.34 March .07 April .46 April 1.76 May 2.01 May 1.08 June 1.38 June 1.37 July 3.50 July 1.11 August 3.58 August 1.59 September 4.58 September 2.43 October 5.45 October 3.01 November 3.63 November 2.59 December 2.49 December 3.52 Total in inches 31.83 Total in inches 22.97 9 A (3) Unemployment Figures and Comments With the co-operation of the Manager of Erith Employment Exchange, to whom I am indebted for the necessary information, it is once again possible to give definite figures with regard to the state of unemployment in the district, as shown in the following table.

C(11) Mortuary For the first six months of the year, H.M. Coroner continued to direct bodies to the Mortuary at West Hill Hospital, Dartford, due to the difficulties experienced in providing technical assistance for the pathologists at Bexley Mortuary. The Bexley Mortuary returned to normal operation on 1st July, 1961, and for the six months ended 31st December, 1961, the mortuary accommodated 94 bodies, and postmortem examinations were carried out in 94 cases. Nine inquests were held. Thirty bodies were from the Erith area and post-mortem examinations were carried out in each case. There were two inquests. C(12) Disinfection Services The joint scheme with the Bexley Borough Council for the disinfection of bedding following cases of infectious disease, tuberculosis and cancer, and for the disinfestation of bedding of verminous persons was discontinued during the year on account of the need to replace the vertical boiler at Bexley and the fact that the Bexley Council had plans for the demolition of the Cleansing Station. The joint application by the Councils of Erith, Bexley and Crayford was successfully made to the Woolwich Borough Council for the use of their disinfection facilities until further notice. C(13) Welfare of Old People The work of the Erith Old People's Welfare Committee continued during the year and the home visiting and good neighbourly services were again one of the busiest activities of the Committee. Two seaside holiday parties were arranged under the holiday scheme and, in addition, a day outing to the coast was conducted, free of charge. 173 Christmas parcels were provided and distributed. C(14) National Assistance Act, 1948, Section 50 (Burials) During the year under review it was necessary, in accordance with the provisions of the above Act, for the Council to carry out one burial:— Mrs. K. B. Deceased was 80 years of age and died in a local nursing home. There were no known liable relatives. 26 SECTION D—SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA I am indebted to the Borough Engineer and Surveyor for the following information relating to refuse collection and disposal. D(1) Refuse Collection and Disposal The method of storage is by means of sanitary dustbins and some 19,600 are emptied weekly. The dustbins are provided and maintained by the owners of the properties concerned, the Council securing this by a local Act—The Erith Improvement Act 1920. The refuse is transported to a Transfer Depot where it is transferred into Contractors' bulk container vehicles, and disposal is effected by tipping at Stone. D(l)a Costs £ s. d.

D(5) Sanitary Inspection of the Area D(5)a Visits by Public Health Inspectors The total number of visits was 10,972 Notices served: Formal 47, Informal 360 407 Complaints received and investigated 1,069 Number of disinfections 29 D(5)b Premises visited and Results of such visits Premises No. in Borough No. of visits No. of defects found No. ot defects remedied Milkshops 34 73 7 7 Dairies 4 22 2 2 Bakehouses 7 31 4 4 Butchers' shops 35 245 12 12 Fish friers 11 48 7 7 Slaughterhouses 1 580 1 1 Factories 145 78 13 13 Outworkers 48 48 0 0 Food factories 5 19 2 2 Pet animal shops 5 41 1 1 Raj flock dealers 3 26 I 1 Cinemas 1 11 1 1 D(5)c Summary of Nuisances abated and defects remedied during the year Roofs repaired 36 Dampness remedied . 42 Dustbins provided 24 Gutters repaired 33 New W.C.s provided 2 New W.C. pans 11 Water supplies provided 10 Floors repaired 22 Plasters renewed 31 New fireplaces 5 Windows made to open 19 Drains cleared 63 Drains repaired 46 Accumulations removed 15 Miscellaneous 77 D(5)d Drainage, Closet accommodation and Cesspools The majority of the closet accommodation, both in the older parts of the town and recently developed areas, is on the main drainage system, and where necessary, sewers have been extended during the year. Of domestic cesspools, 16 are known to exist and these are regularly cleansed and emptied in accordance with the resolution of the Council dated 10th March, 1942. The Borough's sewerage system outfalls to appropriate plant at Dartford and is disposed of by the West Kent Main Sewerage Board. 30 D(5)e Atmospheric Pollution Results of Analysis (A) The Erith Borough Council is represented on the Thames-side Advisory Committee for the Abatement of Atmospheric Pollution. In this connection, a deposit gauge, lead peroxide gauge, and a smoke recorder are respectively in various positions and the analysis of the contents of these instruments for 1961 are as follows:— Month Deposit gauge Lead peroxide gauge Sulphur mg/100 sq. cms/day Rain in inches Insoluble deposit Tons per sq. mile Soluble deposit Tons per sq. mile Total Solids Tons per sq. mile Calcium Tons per sq. mile January 2.12 6.69 5.50 12.19 0.90 2.45 February 1.85 11.48 6.75 18.23 1.26 2.34 March 0.60 7.29 6.24 13.53 1.36 2.89 April 1.33 7.87 8.89 16.76 1.90 1.21 May 1.69 6.69 4.30 10.99 0.62 1.11 June 1.39 8.31 6.41 14.72 1.11 1.01 July 1.53 14.45 3.39 17.84 0.42 1.02 August 2.21 11.85 4.09 15.94 0.39 0.94 September 2.05 11.74 13.86 25.60 2.79 1.04 October 2.89 4.60 7.18 11.78 1.03 1.42 November 2.45 6.14 9.67 15.81 1.54 2.32 December 2.54 8.54 11.48 20.02 2.30 2.20 Monthly average for 1960 15.66 1.42 1.75 (B) The combined filter for smoke and sulphur dioxide apparatus which has been in operation at the Town Hall since July, 1958 has been maintained by the Department throughout the year, and the readings and results thereof have been carried out and recorded daily. Appended below are particulars of the highest figures recorded during the year 1961, ending on 31st December:— Smoke: Smog level Sulphur dioxide: Smog level (200 mgs. black suspended (40 parts per 100 million matter per 100 cu. metres of air) parts of air) 71.0 on 12th Jan. 23.6 on 8th Dec. Highest reading 1960 Highest reading 1960 101.0 on 7th Jan. 37.0 on 9th Dec. (C) Compaints were received regarding emission of fumes from two chemical processing factories, subsequent investigations presenting problems with no easy solutions because 31 of the difficulty of identifying specific plant which was considered to be responsible for the effluvia. In both instances, however, the managements undertook to call in appropriate industrial specialists with a view to effecting improvements. During the year, it was found that large accumulations of deposited ash orginating from electric power stations situated outside the Borough, were giving rise to a dust nuisance, in consequence of which it was necessary to implement Section 93 of the Public Health Act 1936. Service of a statutory notice on the owner of the site in question resulted in the accumulations being removed. D(5)f The Clean Air Act 1956 During the year, the detailed survey of all premises situated in the proposed smoke control area was completed and the information arising therefrom collated so that the cost of carrying out reasonably necessary replacements and conversions could be estimated. In November, the Council resolved to make The Borough of Erith (No. 1) Smoke Control Order 1961, and at the end of the year the necessary maps, Order and other data had been prepared for submission to the Minister. Bearing in mind the large size of the area and the amount of works involved, it was decided that the Order should come into operation on 1st October, 1964. D(5)g Swimming Baths and Pools (1) The Council's open air bath is situated in Stonewood Road, and comprises one pool of 57,000 gallons capacity which now is exclusively used by the Kent Education Committee during normal school hours and local youth clubs during the evenings and on Saturdays. Water in the pool, which originates from a well 40 feet deep, is heated to a reasonable temperature by low pressure steam heating and is sterilised by the chlorine process. There is a slipperbath establishment with accommodation for 16 males and 4 females. Adjacent to the bath is a mechanical laundry which launders on behalf of the various undertakings in the locality a™ which includes the Corporation Catering Dept., the Works Dept., the County Health and Education Depts., and he Royal Alfred Seaman's Home. During the year, 75,477 articles were laundered. 32 Attendances at the Swimming Baths for 1961. Swimming pool Slipper baths Schools: During term 13,356 Schools: During holidays 2,318 Youth Clubs 7,760 Total Total for 1961 23,434 for 1961 15,617 Total Total for 1960 32,910 for 1960 15,332 (2) A childrens' paddling pool of 60,000 gallons capacity is situated within the Belvedere recreation ground at Woolwich Road, and this is a popular rendezvous during the summer months. The pool is regularly emptied and cleansed during the oeriod it is in use, and methodically dosed with chloros. A successful model power boat regatta sponsored by Welling & District Model Engineers Society was held at the pool in May, 1961. D(5)h Offensive Trades Other than 11 fish frying establishments, there are no other scheduled offensive trades under Section 107 of the Public Health Act 1936 in the Borough. Fish frying was declared to be an offensive trade on 17th March 1939, and bye-laws were made accordingly. All the fish frying businesses are well conducted and the frying apparatus at each is of modern and approved pattern. D(5)i Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act 1951 There are now three registered premises in the Borough in which filling materials as defined in the Act are used. The Act is designed to secure that clean filling materials are used in the upholstery trade, and applies to manufacturers' and dealers' premises alike. The persons operating businesses are dealers, and in addition to regular inspections made at their premises, samples have been obtained and submitted to the Prescribed Analyst for the purpose of testing. 33 A typical Report is as follows:— Tests Results Trash content (1) 5.9% (2) 6.1% (3) 5.8% Average 5.9% Oil content 0.4% Dust Index (1) 1.2 (2) 1.1 Average 1.1 Remarks:—Sample satisfactory. 19th May, 1961. D(5)j Pet Animals Act 1951 There are 5 pet animals shops in the Borough at which a wide variety of domestic pets can be purchased. All the premises are well conducted, and no conditions contrary to the welfare provisions of the above Act have been observed. D(5)k Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960 Under Section 3 of the above Act, there is only one conditionally licensed site existing in the Borough. The site in question consists of one half acre of land on which three caravans are stationed. During the year, the area has been free from indiscriminate caravan squatters. D(5)1 Hop pickers There are no hop fields in the district. D(5)m Rodent control Two fully trained operatives are employed to deal with rodent infestations at commercial, private and Corporation premises. The numbers of premises inspected and treated during the year are as follows:— Inspected Treated Commercial premises 73 27 Dwellings 436 55 34 In March and September, a total of 113 Corporation sewer manholes (a 10% test) was subjected to pre-baiting as a result of which 10 manholes were found to be rat infested, and these were successfully treated with baits consisting of oatmeal, sugar, oil, warfarin poison and added preservative. In April, Erith was one of the towns chosen by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for the purpose of a statistical survey into rodent control generally and the Department co-operated with the Ministry to the full. There is only one known black rat reservoir in the Borough, i.e. a Thames-side factory and regular inspections and the results thereof indicate that the best practicable means are employed with a view to keeping the premises free from major infestation. The Prevention of Damage by Pests (application to Shipping) Order, 1951, applies to the many wharfs, jetties and dry slipways in the Borough, and was implemented by the following visits and inspections being made:— Commercial barges 51 Coastwise vessels 21 Tugs 26 Dredgers 2 Oil tankers 11 Miscellaneous craft 1 No marine infestations were located during the year. D(5)n Pest control. For many years, the Department has operated a private works scheme with considerable success as a result of which matters which are outside the scope of the statutory provisions of the Public Health Act can be dealt with promptly. This practical assistance of the Department's outdoor service is available to all residents who need such help, in particular having regard to choked waste pipes, soilpipes and drainsand the destruction of ants and wasps nests. The income from the above service amounted to £42 1s. which represents the cost of materials, etc. used and the apportionment charge on the operative's time. A suspected Colorado Beetle which was submitted for identification was found to be Amphimallus (a summer chafer). 35 D(5)o Eradication of Bed Bugs Vermin infestations continued to decrease and the number of dwellings treated during the year was as follows:— Privately owned houses 4 Corporation houses 4 Occupiers are encouraged to reveal promptly any signs of infestation so that the menace can be eradicated in its initial stages. D(5)p Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act 1952 and Regulations 1953 Almost without exception, heating appliances sold in shops have a guarantee attached which declares that the fitments comply with the safety requirements of the above Act and Regulations. With a view of ensuring that gas and electric appliances do comply, however, it is the practice of the Department to inspect fitments exposed for sale in shops and apply the appropriate probe test. During the year, the test in question was applied to 176 fitments, when it was found that all were satisfactory. Special attention was devoted to appliances found to be on sale at second-hand establishments. Domestic oil heaters still continue to be popular with the public generally, and of the 3,500,000 in use in this country, it would be difficult to asses the proportion of such appliances, particularly those of foreign origin, which were bought before 1960, and not modified to compliance with British Standard 3300. In the best safety interests, therefore, it is considered that all owners of the oil heaters referred to who are in doubt, should have the fitments checked by their retailers. D(5)q Mosquito Control Whilst the whole of the river frontage has been kept under review, particular attention has been paid to the many ditches which intersect the Belvedere and Abbey Wood marsh area and outfall to the River Thames. In addition to the possible breeding grounds which are apparent in the marsh area, there is always the possibility of air-borne invasion of mosquitoes from home-bound shipping. It is for this reason that all potential breeding and resting places are thoroughly dosed with D.D.T. and Lindane as a result of which good control was maintained during the year, and no complaints were received. 36 D(5)r Agriculture (Safely, Health and Welfare Provisions) Act 1956. Sections 3 and 5 of the above Act place duties on Local Authorities in connection with the provision of sanitary conveniences at farms and similar premises. Very few exist in the Borough, but each is served with suitable sanitary accommodation. The premises in question are kept under review, and the necessary return has been made to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. D(5)s Common Lodging Houses The are no Common Lodging Houses in the Borough. D(6) Shops Act 1950 (a) The following Closing Orders are in operation in the area:— Closing hour (1) Erith Weekly Half Holiday (No. 1) Order dated 17th February, 1913 1 p.m. Thursday (2) Erith Hairdressers & Barbers Shops Closing Order dated 11th March, 7 p.m. every 1947 evening (b) No partial exemption Orders with regard to Sunday trading provided for by Section 48 of the Shops Act 1950 exist. (c) The majority of unmixed trade shops in the Borough close at 5.30 p.m. to 6 p.m. (d) Routine inspections during the year revealed that carpet sales were taking place at various premises other than shops, and in some cases at times which were contrary to hours prescribed by the Shops Act 1950. In one instance it was necessary to prohibit a sale taking place because the session was arranged for a Thursday afternoon, whilst in three other cases, the adjustment of the closing hour from 9 p.m. to 8 p.m. effected compliance with the Statute. (e) No legal proceedings were instituted during the year, but on three occasions it was found necessary to draw the attention of shop-keepers to the statutory provisions with regard to Sunday trading. 37 (f) The application of the provisions of Section 38 of the Shops Act 1950 resulted in the following improvements being carried out:— Washing facilities provided 8 Heating provided or improved 14 Seats provided for assistants 7 Lighting improved 4 Sanitary conveniences 9 D(7) Sanitary Accommodation at Offices In accordance with the requirements of section 46 of the Public Health Act, 1936, all new offices constructed in the developing area at Belvedere were provided with suitable and sufficient sanitary accommodation. Many improvements were effected at existing premises. D(8) Street Trading There is no established street trading in the Borough, there being only three mobile stalls sited in the shopping area. No nuisances have been located at these sources. D(9) River Pollution. The Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1961 The appointed day for Section 1 of the above Act which extends to all discharges existing before 1951 the provisions of the 1951 Act necessitating a River Board's consent for the discharge of trade or sewage effluent into a stream, is likely to be 27th July, 1962. The Act applies to effluents discharged from inefficient and over-loaded sewage works, and to isolated discharges of sewage or waste water directly to a stream or ditch from a single house or a group of houses. Whilst there are no known domestic drains outfalling to the Belvedere and Abbey Wood marsh ditches, there are a few cases where trade effluent gains access to the water courses in question. River Thames—Effluvia. Whilst odorous emanations from the River Thames have not been complained of by residents during the year, 38 theless, the presence of atmospheric sulphuretted hydrogen has been apparent from time to time at various positions on the river bank. On no occasions, however, have the gas liberations been anything like so prolonged as those which existed during the summers which preceded that of 1960, and in November it was claimed that for the first time in 20 years, live fish had been seen in the River Thames off Erith. In September, the London County Council announced that sludge vessels 'Henry Ward,' 'J. H. Hunter' and 'John Perring ' (1,500 ton boats), having served for nearly 40 years and each having steamed over a million miles, were to be replaced by two twin screw Diesel sludge vessels. Delivery of the first boat is expected on 1st December, 1963 and the second on 1st June, 1964. The boats will carry 2,000 tons of sludge and are designed for a maximum speed of 12 knots. When commissioned, they will take sludge from the mam drainage outfall works at Crossness and Barking to a deposit area at Black Deep in the North Sea, a return distance of about 110 miles. The Clean Rivers (Estuaries and Tidal Waters) Act which came into operation on 29th September, 1960 is the Statute for dealing with the pollution of tidal rivers. The schedule to the Act lists all such rivers in England and Wales, except the River Thames, for which the Port of London Authority already has powers. D(10) Flooding Following the exceptional rainfall during a storm on the evening of 4th May, flooding incidents were localised and minor in character. In no instance was it found necessary to render material assistance other than that of removing obstructions from a number of choked interceptors. D(11) Council Refuse Tip. Prior to its ultimate disposal by contractors, town's refuse is temporarily deposited at a Council site in Manor Road. The site in question is kept under constant review, particular attention being paid to the possibility of rodent infestation. One minor infestation was effectively dealt with during the year. 39 D(12) Proposed Controlled Tipping Land at Harrow Manorway. In November, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government dismissed the appeal made by the Greenwich Borough Council on behalf of certain Metropolitan Boroughs against the refusal of planning permission for controlled lipping of domestic refuse at the above site. In view of the negotiations which were taking place for the sale of the land to London County Council, the Minister dismissed the appeal without prejudice to a renewed application when the ultimate use of the land was decided upon. D(13) The Public Health Laboratory Service (Appointed Day) Order, 1961 This Order appointed 1st August 1961 as the appointed day for the purposes of the Public Health Laboratory Service Act, 1960 which provides for the constitution of a Board to exercise functions with respect to the administration of the bacteriological service provided by the Minister of Health under Section 17 of the National Health Service Act, 1946. D(14) Noise Abatement Act, 1960 Since the introduction of this Act, unnecessary or unreasonable noise is declared as a statutory nuisance and the power to effect the abatement of such nuisance has been delegated to the Health Committee. During 1961, two complaints were received regarding noise originating in factories, and there is every reason to believe that the informal action taken by the Public Health Inspectors satisfied the complainants. It is very clear, however, that although considerable research appears to have been made into noise generally, its sources, and methods of control, much more research work will be necessary before level standards can be defined and accepted as criteria to cope with the many and varied situations met with in an industrial town such as Erith. Inspections reveal that the reaction of individuals—and districts too—to noise is unpredictable and varies considerably in that a level of noise tolerated in one locality may S've rise to strong protests in another. At the National Physical Laboratory Conference at Tedd'ngton in June, it was authoritatively stated that, as yet, no "istrument has been devised which can determine whether a noise is likely to be unacceptable to the hearer, and that many factors including the psychological are involved. It would appear, therefore, that until some reasonably easy-toapply Presumptive standard is forthcoming, the statutory suppression of offending noise will continue to present many difficulties. 40 D(15) Factories Acts 1937 to 1959 Part 1 of the Act (1)Inspections for purposes of provisions as to health (including inspections made by Public Health Inspectors).

Resulting from breaches of mortgage conditions, a meeting was convened with the residents concerned on 21st March when all relevant aspects were explored with a view to achieving conformity with the necessary requirements. The Chief Public Health Inspector outlined the basic principals of good sanitary circumstances. In the main certain Commonwealth families residing in the Borough tend to live in colonies thus insulating themselves from other people. Local institutions, traditions and ideals do not appear, as yet, to have touched their personal lives and reality to any appreciable extent, though it is becoming abundantly obvious that education is having a favourable and integrating influence on their children who attend the local schools. D(18) Discretionary Grants These are available for a wide range of improvements which enable houses built before 1945 to be thoroughly modernised to a 12 point standard. During the year, 41 Discretionary grant applications were approved. D(19) Standard Grants These grants are available in respect of improvements of dwellings built before 1945, by provision of the following amenities:— (a) a fixed bath or shower in a bathroom, (b) a wash-hand basin, (c) a hot water supply, (d) a water closet in, or contiguous to the dwelling, (e) satisfactory facilities for storing food. During the year, 28 Standard grants were approved. 45 D(20) The Rent Act, 1957 The majority of enquiries regarding this Act are made by tenants desirous of effecting rent reductions because of items of disrepair, but considerable assistance has been given to tenants regarding information on de-control, notice to quit, and tenancy agreement matters. Having regard to the circumstances, each case is dealt with on its merits. Action under the Act is enumerated below:— (1) Number of applications for Certificates of Disrepair 4 (2) Number of Certificates issued 0 (3) Number of Revocations applied for 6 (4) Number of Revocations granted 3 No appeals, either by landlords or by tenants against Local Authority decisions were made to the County Court during the year. 46 SECTION E—WATER SUPPLY—MILK—FOOD AND DRUGS ACT—FOOD INSPECTION E(1) Water supply The Borough is served throughout by the Metropolitan Water Board, the water containing some 30.8 degrees of hardness. Almost without exception, the supply is led direct into the premises served. Twenty four samples drawn from various points in the district have been forwarded to the appropriate Laboratory for bacteriological examination, with satisfactory results. The total length of new mains laid amounted to 1,481 yards. Complaints were received that water in service pipes in the newly-erected dwellings at Christchurch Avenue was coloured green. On investigation it was found thai the green colour inside domestic kettles was due to the deposition of carbonate of calcium and by a small admixture of copper carbonate and attributable to new copper, lead and galvanised iron water fitments. By the end of the year, the chemical accretion in the water service pipes was neutralized. E(2) Milk supply E(2)a Food and Drugs Act 1955. Section 37. The Milk (Special Designations) (Specified areas) Order 1951. In pursuance of the above Older which has operated since 1st October 1951, all milk which is retailed in the Borougn is specially designated. E(2)b Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, I960 (a) The designations applicable to milk sold in the Borough are 'Pasteurised,' 'Sterilised' and 'Tuberculin Tested.' Pasteurised milk must be bottled at the premises at which it is heat treated. There are no pasteurising plants and bottling establishments within the Borough. More than 94% of milk sold by retail in England and Wales is now heat treated. 47 (b) Details of dealers licences to use a special designation in relation to milk which is obtained and sold pre-packed by the dealer are as follows Pasteurised 22 Sterilised 38 Tuberculin tested 12 Total 72 (c) The following samples of designated milk from various sources and retailed in the Borough were obtained and submitted for examination:— Pasteurised 25 Sterilised 5 Tuberculin Tested 1 Total 31 All satisfied the prescribed tests. E(2)c Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959 Number of registered distributors in Borough 13 Number of dairies 4 Number of milkshops 34 Number of producer/retailers 0 Regular inspections have been made at the above throughout the year. E(2)d Ice-Cream 127 premises in the Borough are registered for the sale of ice-cream. There are 3 active manufacturers of ice-cream (2 boil mix and 1 cold mix). The Ice-cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations 1959. Bacteriological sampling. Six samples were obtained and forwarded for bacterio logical examination with the following results:— Grade 1 3 Grade 2 1 Grade 3 2 48 E(3) Meat and Food Inspection E(3)a Slaughterhouses There is one privately owned slaughterhouse in the Borough in which slaughtering takes place daily, in the evenings of at least three days, and on every Saturday and Sunday. This slaughtering at irregular hours has been maintained throughout the year, and in effecting 100% inspection, the time devoted to. meat inspection is equivalent to the service of a full lime Public Health Inspector. Until legislation makes provision for regulating ana stabilising hours of slaughter, it would appear that the present exacting situation which the department has to cope with is likely to continue. E(3)b Swine Fever and Brucellosis The introduction of a proposed compulsory slaughter policy for swine fever has been deferred until early 1963. The long term free calf vaccination service against Brucellosis in England, Scotland and Wales is expected to come into operation on 1st May, 1962. 49 The following table in prescribed form details the number of carcases inspected and condemned:— Carcases and offal inspected and condemned in whole or in part. Cattle excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Horses Number killed 1652 1598 416 9095 34341 — Number inspected 1652 1598 416 9095 34341 — All diseases except Tuberculosis and Cyslicerci.

For the purposes of the above Order, England and Wales has been an attested area since 1st October, 1960, the County of Kent reaching attested area status on 1st October, 1958. During the normal course of meat inspection by the Public Health Inspectors at the Belvedere slaughterhouse, lesions of generalised tuberculosis were found in two bovine carcases as a result of which the Animal Health Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at Maidstone was notified and veterinary officers were enabled to identify the animals concerned, trace back to the herd of origin and impose restrictions on that herd, including the carrying out of tuberculin tests. E(3)d Foot and Mouth Disease No case of Foot and Mouth Disease occurred in the Borough during the year. E(3)e Other Foods Much time and attention has been devoted to the inspection of food in shops and stores, as a result of which the following was found to be unfit for human consumption, and consequently destroyed:— cwts. qtrs. lbs. Meat 4 1 4 Cheese 11 Fruit 2 0 0 Fats 1 Vegetables 19 Confectionery 1 0 Fish 2 12 Tinned goods 8 3 Total weight 17 2 11 51 E(3)f Disposal of Unsound Meat and other Food As there are no sterilising facilities for unfit meat at the Belvedere slaughterhouse, such meat is stained with naphthaline green and transported by arrangement for sterilisation elsewhere. All unsound food, exclusive of the above is disposed of by tipping with the town's refuse. E(3)g Slaughter of Animals Act, 1958 Humane slaughtering of all animals in accordance with the above prevails in the Borough. The instruments used are the captive bolt pistol and the electrolethaler. The number of slaughtermen's licences operative is 15. 52 E(4) Food and Drugs Act, 1955. Sections 2 and 91. (a) The following samples were procured during the yea' and submitted to the Public Analyst for the purpose of analysis with results as follows:— Article Adulterated Intermediate Genuine No. of Samples Milk - 1 18 19 Spices and Herbs — — 4 4 Sauce — — 5 5 Cream — — 2 2 Medicines — — 3 3 Beverages — — 4 4 Fruit drinks — — 8 8 Canned and dried fruit — — 7 7 Sausages — — 4 4 Sweets and Confectionery — — 5 5 Fish and fish paste — — 2 2 Meat and meat paste — — 8 8 Biscuits — — 2 2 Canned and dried vegetables — — 4 4 Sponge and cake mixtures — — 3 3 Milk puddings — — 3 3 Cheese and other spreads — — 4 4 Pontefract cakes — — 1 1 Senna granules — — 1 1 Mincemeat — — 1 1 Ice Cream — — 2 2 Nipits — — 1 1 Christmas puddings — — 2 2 Angelica — — 1 1 Marzipan — — 1 1 Soup - 1 — 1 Browning — — 1 1 Preserves — — 2 2 Flour — — 1 1 Marmite — — 1 1 Custard powder — — 1 1 Bread — 3 — 3 Salad cream — — 1 1 Vinegar — — 1 1 Butter — — 1 1 Margarine — — 2 2 Pickles - — 1 1 Lemon curd tart — 1 — 1 Condensed milk — — 1 1 Mustard - — 1 1 Parrish's food - — 1 1 Sweetening pellets — — 1 1 Fruit pie - — 1 1 - 6 113 119 With regard to the 6 Intermediate reports, warning letters were sent to the food retailers concerned. The milk samples had an average fat content of 3.7% and 8.72% solids not fat. 53 (b) Domestic Food Consumption. Report of National Food Survey Committee. One of the most interesting features of this Report, published in July, is the reference to the rising demand by consumers of "convenience foods" (i.e. labour saving, prepared or semi-prepared products), expenditure on which now accounts for nearly one fifth of total household food expenditure. A rise of almost 4 per cent in the real value of food purchases between 1955 and 1959 was almost entirely attributable to increased expenditure on such foods. Additional purchasing power in the home usually results in more expensive and selected foods, and this is reflected by the modern tendency for many housewives to take up paid employment which results in less time being available for the household preparation of food, and thus inducing the demand for the "convenience foods." It is also interesting to note that food expenditure per head rises fairly sharply as the age of the housewife increases from 20 to 40, but thereafter declines. Also that younger women spend more money on "convenience foods" than the older housewives. E(5) Food Hygiene. The Food Hygiene (General) Regulations 1960. (a) There are now comparatively few food shops which are without open topped refrigerated display cabinets, and in the interests of food hygiene, the practice is admirable. In this regard, however, the following three problems arise which concern the Public Health Inspector, viz:— 1. The growing inclination of small traders to sell partpacks of deep frozen commodities. 2. The loading of display cabinets over the cold zone line. 3. The difficulty of an Inspector being aware when a deep freeze cabinet has failed to function at any particular time. Thus, to ensure that frozen foods are as safe as they are claimed to be, regular visits by the Public Health Inspector are necessary with a view to his being conversant with all the intricacies of mechanically aided retailing. (b) Code of practice No. 5 with respect to poultry dressing packing was formulated by the Minister of Health and he Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in September with the approval of the Food Hygiene Advisory Council 54 under Section 13(8) of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955. This Code is for the purpose of giving advice and guidance to persons in the poultry packing trade and who are responsible for compliance with the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations 1960. The Code has no statutory force, its object being to enable the trade and the Local Authority to recognise the underlying problem and to work out the particular solution required by the local circumstances. (c) All the 34 public houses in the Borough have been inspected, resulting from which many sanitary and other improvements have been carried out, and where necessary, recommendations have been made with a view to improving service of food. Number of food premises in Borough, (a) Registered under Statute. No. of premises. No. of visits.

Sanitary circumstances and associated home conditions of the many aged persons have been kept under review, and where indicated, the necessary improvements have been effected. F(5) Health Education During the year the Medical Officer of Health and the Chief Public Health Inspector gave many talks to local organisations and, as in previous years, the talks covered a wide range of public health subjects showing the diversity of functions undertaken by the Department. F(6) Commonwealth Technical Training Week, 29th May to 2nd June, 1961 In conjunction with other Departments, the Health Department participated in the organisation and maintenance of the Local Authority's stand at the exhibition held in connection with the above Training Week. The display, which included various atmospheric pollution apparatus and meat inspection equipment, was a source of considerable interest. F(7) Home Safety During the year an intensive campaign was conducted in the area covered by the Bexley, Erith and Crayford Home Safety Committee. A comprehensive exhibition was held in the foyer of the Erith Town Hall, with shop window displays in both Bexleyheath and Crayford. A number of display stands and exhibits were obtained from R.O.S.P.A. and trade sources and considerable interest was shown by the public in these exhibitions. A number of film shows and talks were given by the Medical Officer of Health and the Chairman of the Home Safety Committee, Alderman Mrs. H. F. Piggott, and a widespread distribution of bookmarks, leaflets, etc. was made to clinics, libraries and other suitable premises. It is anticipated that this work will gain further momentum when the part-time Home Safety organiser is appointed. 56 F(8) Legislation in Force—Bye-laws, etc. Provision of Dustbins Erith Improvement Act 1920 Tents vans and sheds 28th Feb. 1928 Houses let-in-lodgings 27th Jan. 1930 Libraries and Museums 15th June 1934 Nursing homes 20th July 1934 Pleasure grounds 4th Feb. 1936 Fish frying 9th May 1939 House refuse 17th Oct 1939 Erith Cemetery 25th Oct. 1939 Public baths 26th Oct. 1939 Prevention of nuisances 23rd April 1940 Good rule and government 1st Jan. 1941 Offensive trades 9th May 1939 Deposit of litter 9th Jan. 1950 Clean food 19th July 1950 Building bye-laws 7th Dec. 1953 Deposit of substances on highways 27th Oct. 1954 Slaughterhouses 29th Nov. 1956 Deposit of loose substances on highways 1st Mar. 1957 Building Bye-laws — Smoke Prevention 1st April 1959 Kent County Council Act, 1958 Sections 57, 106, 114, 116, 118, 131. 138, 142.
