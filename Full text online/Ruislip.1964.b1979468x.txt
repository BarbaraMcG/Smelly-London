Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Nineteen sixty-four was the last complete year during which the District survived as an entity in its own right. It is with satisfaction that it can be reported that, as in the case of the last few years, there was no untoward happening to cause any undue alarm from the public health point of view. The success of a public health department may, I think, be measured by how little needs to be reported—it is, indeed, only when some major epidemic becomes important news that the existence of the department comes to the public notice at all. The vital statistics are set out in the succeeding pages in the usual form. It will be seen that the corrected live birth rate of 14.3 compares with the rate for England and Wales of 18.4, while the death rate of 9.9 compares with the national rate of 11.3. Fifteen infants died under the age of one year, and the causes of these deaths—which are set out in the report—show that they are caused by conditions the causes of which are very imperfectly understood. Much research is needed into these conditions before any great reduction in this infantile mortality can be brought about. It is pleasing to note, however, that the local infantile mortality rate is only 14.4 compared with the national rate of 20.0. A further cause for satisfaction is that there was no maternal death; from all this one can congratulate the ante-natal, midwifery and health visiting services on a most valuable contribution to the well being of the community. The principal causes of death were diseases of the heart and arteries and cancer, and, as in recent years, infectious disease played a very minor role. Research into the principal causes of death is being pushed along in all the advanced countries of the world, but the real causes still elude the investigators everywhere. Lung cancer cases showed a welcome fall—from 51 to 36, but cases in women were reduced only by 1—10 in 1963 and 9 in this year. The association between heavy cigarette smoking and lung cancer is too well known to need emphasis here, but it cannot be repeated too often that lung cancer is largely a preventable disease, and many sufferers may have only themselves to blame. While a fall in the number of cases is of course welcome, it cannot be assumed that this will continue, and the incidence of this condition will need to be watched with very great interest. The work of preventing infectious disease by immunisation was continued on the accepted lines. This becomes more and more uphill work, for the simple reason that in the absence of disease the stimulus to many parents to have protection for their children is absent. Why protect against something which is not there? This is another example of success making continued public acceptance of a measure more difficult. Who worries about poliomyelitis now ? The position 2 is that unless a certain high level of immunity is kept up, there is a definite risk that infections will return—the germs are always present in the community—maybe in epidemic form. The price of freedom from infectious disease is eternal vigilance, and persistence in carrying out the immunisation programme to its fullest possible extent. Mention has been made previously of the risk of the importation of smallpox in this age of rapid air travel. A district so near to an international airport needs to be particularly careful to be as fully protected as possible. Therefore, infant vaccination is advised, first to protect the individual, and second to make any re-vaccination which may be necessary for contact or travel purposes much less troublesome in later years. The work of a public health department is very much a team effort, and I cannot let this opportunity pass without expressing my personal thanks to Mr. Jenkins, the Chief Public Health Inspector, and his colleagues for their most loyal co-operation over many years. The extent of their work is summarised in Mr. Jenkins' report, and this gives only the outlines of what is really achieved in securing a high environmental standard for the district. It is fitting also that tribute should be paid to the co-operation always willingly given by the general practitioners of the district and by the hospital staffs whenever they have been involved. This help has made the work so much more worthwhile. Finally, the help and encouragement given by the Chairman and members of the Health Committee have been of inestimable value. It has been a pleasure to work under such conditions of full support, and I am extremely grateful to have had the opportunity of so doing over all the years I have been here. 1 am sorry that such an association must now come to an end. I am, Your obedient Servant, O. C. DOBSON, Medical Officer of Health. 3 STATISTICS TOTAL AREA OF DISTRICT 6,583 acres.
