Public Health Office, Town Hall, Walworth Road. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting for your consideration my Twenty-Second Annual Report on the vital statistics and general sanitary work of the Borough for the year 1908. There has been during the year a further important decline in the death-rate, and a small decline in the birth-rate. There has been a small amount of notifiable disease and of infectious disease generally during the year. Cerebro-Spinal Fever was fatal in six cases. The year upon the whole was a healthy one, and the Infant Mortality further declined. Many important matters have engaged the attention of the Public Health Staff. Infants were more regularly visited and the homes carefully examined. Additional water supplies were provided in many of our tenemented houses. The Staff has zealously performed its duties. I have to thank the Council and the Public Health Committee for their courtesy and support. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Southwark. 5 SUMMARY OF STATISTICS.

The whole of the borough from a variety of causes, such as, the migration of the better-to-do class to the suburbs, the closing of important works and business premises, together with a general shrinkage of incomes all round, is passing through a period of active transition. Facilities are being given to all classes, but the very lowest, to live more in the country, hence the usual method of house letting has changed in every part of the district. It is no longer possible, even with the best class of house, to find a tenant who can afford to occupy it entirely without any sub-letting. Even in some of our best residential squares, the houses of which from time immemorial have been occupied by distinguished persons, it has been found impossible during the last few years to get single family tenants for them. The owners have been compelled to let them for the purpose of being sub-let to two or more families, with a disastrous result from a sanitary as well as a remunerative point of view. Large landlords hardly know what to do to meet this changed state of affairs. Some landlords have pulled their property down and have erected on the sites two or three storeyed houses with accommodation for a family on each floor, others again are arranging better class houses in pairs and so providing more or less expensive flats. The enormous wear-and-tear suffered by a house of the old type which is let out in lodgings by the tenant, and where every available cupboard is occupied, as is so often the case, is a serious burden upon the landlord in the way of repairs. In old houses landlords are beginning to realise that alterations must be made to enable them to successfully compete with new and well arranged dwellings near. The London County Council have within the last few years in their General Powers Acts obtained important provisions dealing with the water supply to tenement houses, the cleanliness of bedding and clothing, verminous rooms, &c., all which powers are excellent and necessary. In this borough a large number of houses have been given this additional water supply on the upper floors, to the benefit alike of all parties. The landlord has let his property better, whilst the tenant has been grateful for the accommodation. This work of a further water supply has not been carried out in houses without an immense amount of labour on the part of the sanitary staff, as in every case of this additional water supply the whole of the circumstances have had to be taken into consideration so as not to create a nuisance. In the cases in which the landlord has followed our instructions, I believe we have been successful in this matter. There have been certain principles which we have held to all along, and which have had the assent of the Council, (1) Two storeyed houses up to now 7 have not been taken, only those of three or more storeys, (2) The supply has been put on the staircase, except in houses let out in floors, (3) In every case a small deep sink of the shape most convenient with a trapped waste pipe and a down pipe emptying over a gully outside has been recommended. The provision of a water supply in the Section, one would imagine, must include a sink and an exit pipe wherever that terminates. Some landlords have provided simply a drip tray for a sink with a small pipe, like a warning pipe from an ordinary cistern, emptying outside over a roof. This, however, is most unsatisfactory, and soon becomes a nuisance in more ways than one. Some obstinate landlords have provided a stoneware sink without a waste pipe, but this again is nsatisfactory. The northern or river end of the borough is principally the abode of the casual or unskilled labouring class. Lodging houses are numerous and the house property around these places is generally of a debased kind. Although a considerable portion of old Southwark has been within the last twelve years either demolished or renovated, there still remains much that is a menace to the health of the metropolis and should be cleared away. The portion known as the Tabard Street area, lying between Great Dover Street and Long Lane, is very debased. Vice, crime, and immorality abound in much of this area. The scum of South London takes up its abode here generally for short periods. The residents are chiefly hawkers, costermongers, pedlars, and persons of immoral character. Numbers of the houses are let furnished to persons, of a kind, at exorbitant rents. Single rooms at prices ranging from 5/- to 7/- per week and for one night at a much higher price in proportion. This business of letting out furnished rooms has become a most lucrative industry in the hands of agents who rent large numbers of them. The houses in many cases are let by the freeholder at 5/- to 7/- per week each to a lessee, who lets the same at 17/- to an agent who furnishes the house, and who lets again at 32/- to the individual tenants. Nearly all these houses are on the register for houses let in lodgings, and although more or less dilapidated they are kept fairly clean by the lady inspectors charged with that duty. Many of the immoral houses belong to charitable institutions. The death-rate in this neighbourhood, especially in the case of Phthisis, is very high. The regular inhabitants are abjectly poor and miserable. The chief remedy of course is the clearance of the area. Until this can be effected nightly inspection is absolutely necessary. Whether, however' this nightly inspection should be undertaken by the borough or by the London County Council it is not easy to determine. Personally, I believe it would be a good thing to have all the debased areas in the metropolis 8 subjected to a uniform nightly inspection, and as I see no prospect of the boroughs agreeing to any common course of action, the London County Council appears to me to be the only authority capable of dealing effectively with this matter. The southern portion of the borough has a respectable residential population, the chief portion of which during the daytime works away from home. The houses in the streets are well built and convenient. The tenement most sought after is in the house of two storeys, each tenant occupying a floor. Large numbers of these houses are found in the southern portion of the borough, and afford splendid accommodation for the families occupying them. In a poor and densely populated borough as Southwark there must be a considerable number of cases of overcrowding, although rents have gone down very much within the last few years. The chief feature is the increasing poverty of the bulk of our inhabitants, and their careless and untidy habits. The population of the several divisions of the Borough at each Census since 1841, and also the estimated population for 1902, 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906, 1907 and 1908— Newington. St. George's.

The number of Births registered in the Borough during 1908 was 6,027, of which 3,019 were males, and 3,008 females. This represents a birth-rate of 28.1 per 1,000 inhabitants. The number of births belonging to the individual parishes was as follows :—Newington, 3,644 ; St. George the Martyr, 1,820 ; Christchurch, 256 ; and St. Saviour's, 307. In addition to the 6,027 births registered in the Borough I learn from the Registrar General that there were 210 births during the year in various lying-in institutions outside the Borough belonging to persons 10 resident in Southwark, and this number (210) must be added to the total as above, making the actual number of births for the year 6,237, which increases the birth.rate to 29.1 per 1,000. As the addresses in relation to these 210 births have not been communicated to me I am unable to allot them to their respective wards or districts.

Of the 2,969 deaths registered in the sub-districts of the Borough, 1,041 occurred in the Poor-Law institutions, the various hospitals, and other public places for the treatment of the sick found within our boundaries. These deaths in institutions comprised 366 belonging to Southwark, and 675 to other boroughs of the metropolis. The various localities in which the " outlying " deaths occurred are shown in the following table. The number of inhabitants belonging to the Borough dying away from home—that is, outside our boundaries in the various hospitals and infirmaries—-was 1,194. Of this very large number as many as 713 died in the Southwark Infirmary at Champion Hill. The remainder, with but few exceptions, died at the large public hospitals. The percentage of persons dying away from home in relation to the total number of deaths occurring in the Borough was 34.2 When those persons who were non-parishioners, but who died in our Borough have been deducted, and the outlying deaths added, the actual or " corrected" number of deaths belonging to the Sanitary Area is found to be 3,488, of which number 1,813 were males, and 1,675 females. The death-rate when calculated on this " corrected " number is 16.3 per 1,000 inhabitants for the whole Borough for the year 1908, as against a rate of 18.0 for 1907. TABLE 3.

This is the lowest figure that has been recorded for the district. No doubt much of this has been brought about by the disposition at the present time of mothers to breast-feed their children, and to the advice which it has been found possible to give early in the life of the infant by the information received through the Notification of Births Act of 1907. The success of this Act has been particularly gratifying, as more than ninety-five per cent. of the births occurring were notified to me within the statutory period. It is a fact, also, that with rare exceptions, all the births are notified to me sooner or later, working as we do in close touch with the various Registrars. Our system in regard to obtaining this information is that a list of all notifications received by me is sent early in each week to the Registrars in the district, and they in return inform me of all births they have registered, and which have not been notified to me. On receipt of information that a birth has not been duly notified to me I cause the following letter to be sent to the parents concerned :— Dear Sib (ok Madam), NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS ACT, 1907. In the above Act it is made compulsory that the parents of any child shall notify the birth of any such child within 36 hours to the Medical Officer of Health of the district, under a penalty in failing to do so of a sum not exceeding twenty shillings. It has been brought to my notice that a child was born into your family on last, at and that such birth was not notified to me in accordance with the above Act. I hereby give you notice that unless I receive a notification on the enclosed card forthwith the Council of the Borough will be advised to direct that a summons be taken out against you to recover the said penalty. Yours faithfully, G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. 32 When a notification has been received we allow nine days to elapse, so that our officers shall not in any way incommode those in attendance on the mother. At the end of that period a complete inspection of the house in which the birth occurred is made, and the drainage examined by the district inspector. The lady inspector in each district takes under her care the visiting from time to time of the infant and the instruction of the mother when necessary, and the weighing and management of the infant generally. The lady inspectors are assisted in this work by the voluntary lady inspectors of the Southwark Health Society In this way an enormous amount of interest is taken in the well-being of the infant. There is also in the course of this work much more care taken of the cleanliness and comfort of the home than existed formerly. I believe this Notification of Births Act is a valuable piece of legislation, and that it will in the future be the means of bringing information directly to us which formerly could only be obtained in an incomplete and roundabout way. DEATHS of INFANTS UNDER ONE YEAR OF AGE. The deaths of Infants under one year of age to 1,000 births were 131 during the year 1908. The deaths under one year of age to 1,000 births for the last 16 years were as follows : 1893 178 1901 168 1894 163 1902 166 1895 201 1903 148 1896 192 1904 174 1897 187 1905 148 1898 190 1906 144 1899 199 1907 142 1900 192 1908 131 The average number of Infantile deaths for the last sixteen years is 170.

The deaths from Scarlet Fever in the borough were 24 during 1908 as against 35 for the year 1907, and 45 for 1906. There has been during the year a great fall in the number of cases of Scarlet Fever occurring in the Borough. In the ordinary behaviour of this disease we may expect a further decline next year, followed by a rise in the year following. There has been no special outbreak in connection with any of the schools, and the cases have been generally of a mild type. The total number of cases notified was 775 this year, as against 1,275 for 1907. The percentage of deaths to the total cases notified was 3j1. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.11. The number of cases notified, as compared with London, during the last ten years was:— In Southwark. In London. In Southwark.

The deaths in the 775 cases sent to hospital numbered 23, a mortality of 3-0 per cent, as against 2-7 per cent, for last year. In the 19 cases treated at home, there was one death, a mortality of 5-3 per cent. It is our practice to spray the room well with formalin and to strip the paper off the walls in the process of disinfection after Scarlet Fever. In the event of the room being verminous it is afterwards fumigated with sulphur. The Wards most affected were St. John's, St. Mary's, All Saints' and St. Paul's, in the order named. DIPHTHERIA. The year under consideration has been been a record one in regard to the small number of cases of Diphtheria notified. In Southwark for upwards of twenty years past serious flooding of the low-lying parts has occurred after heavy storms. This flooding, which consisted of sewage forced up from the main sewers through the various gullies in cellars and yards, on account of the sewers not being large enough to take the volume of sewage from the higher parts beyond our district, seriously contaminated the sandy subsoil of large portions of the Borough. This periodic fouling of the subsoil was coincident with the increase of Diphtheria. Within the last year a relief sewer has been constructed by the London County Council, and since then no flooding has taken place. It will be interesting to see how far Diphtheria declines in the next few years under this altered condition. The deaths from the disease numbered 32 as against 36 for the year 1907. 59 The total number of cases notified, including Membranous Croup, was 270, and 422 for the preceding year. The percentage of deaths to the total number of cases notified was 11.8. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0'15.

ENTERIC FEVER. The deaths from Enteric Fever during the year numbered 7, as against 11, 12 and 11 for the preceding three years. The total number of cases notified was 48 for the present year, and 80, 111 and 74 for the preceding three years. The percentage of deaths to the total number notified was 14.6. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0 03. 60 The deaths from Enteric Fever for the last ten years :— 1899 32 1900 39 1901 18 1902 23 1903 23 1904 18 1905 11 1906 12 1907 11 1908 7 The number of cases notified during the last ten years:— 1899 178 1900 307 1901 135 1902 193 1903 122 1904 92 1905 74 1906 111 1907 80 1908 48 Of the 48 cases notified as many as 45 were removed to hospital, of which 5 died, a mortality of 11.1 per cent. In the 3 cases treated at home 2 died, a mortality of 66 6 per cent. The percentage of cases removed to hospital to the total number notified was 93 7. DIARRHOEA. There has been an increase in the number of deaths from Diarrhræa in the year under consideration, although it is far below the average for the last ten years. We continue to distribute a circular during the summer months to all the houses of the Borough, setting out the necessity of breast feeding babies, and the keeping of the home free from dirt; also that all refuse and rubbish should as far as possible be burnt, that all articles of food in any way unsound should not be eaten, and that all water for drinking purposes should be drawn from the tap which is fixed on the main supply pipe. The attention given by the lady inspectors to these cases and the advice given by them to mothers I believe are attended by excellent results. The annual death-rate from Diarrhsea per 1,000 living was 0.87. Deaths from diarrhsea during the last ten years:— 1899 260 1900 233 1901 222 1902 169 1903 197 1904 282 1905 183 1906 225 1907 101 1908 188 61 TYPHUS FEVER. No death occurred from this disease during the year, and no case was notified. MEASLES. The deaths from Measles during the year numbered 77, as against 112, 95 and 154 for the previous three years. The death-rate per 1,000 living was 0 36. Deaths from Measles during the last ten years: — 1899 171 1900 116 1901 161 1902 164 1903 83 1904 191 1905 154 1906 95 1907 112 1908 77 The Wards mostly affected were Trinity, St. Michael's, All Saints' and St. Peter's, in the order named. WHOOPING COUGH. The deaths from this disease were 50 for this year and 103 for 1907. The Wards of St. Peter's, All Saints, St. Michael's and St. Mary's were those most affected. The annual death-rate per 1,000 living was 0.23. Deaths from Whooping Cough for the last ten years:— 1899 146 1900 120 1901 98 1902 114 1903 68 1904 118 1905 80 1906 54 1907 103 1908 50 CEREBRO-SPINAL FEVER. During the year six cases of Cerebro-Spinal Fever were notified, all of which died. The cerebro-spinal fluid was examined and reported upon as being characteristic of the complaint. 62 TABLE 31.

The mortality from Tuberculosis is still high, and is chiefly accounted for by the large number of lodging houses in the Borough, by the casual nature of the employment of so many of Qur inhabitants and the consequent poverty, and by the hard struggle for existence seen around us. The waste of life at all ages, and especially in children, is very great. The improvement in children, as seen by the table, is due, I believe, to an increase in the amount of breast-feeding of infants brought about by the attention of the lady inspectors and to the advice given in regard to that subject. We have not in Southwark a large number of mothers who 64 are compelled to work away from home, as is the case in some manufacturing towns, and that circumstance is so much in our favour, yet we have many conditions such as the dirty and unhealthy habits of many of the mothers to contend with. I estimate that nearly ninety percent. of mothers breast feed their infants. The deaths from Phthisis during 1908 were 414, and the notifications uuder the voluntary system in vogue with us, were 427. The latter number must be considered very small in face of the two thousand or more cases always present in the Borough. The compulsory notification of Poor Law cases, which came into force on the 1st of January, 1909, will assist us, but what is wanted is compulsory notification of all known cases and power to detain cases in the infirmaries when no suitable accommodation exists at the home. In regard to the visiting and disinfecting in connection with cases of Phthisis, all cases are visited and in all those desiring it disinfection is carried out weekly or fortnightly, as may be convenient, and in all removals the room and contents are radically attended to. VACCINATION. During the year under consideration about 75 per cent. of the infant population of the Borough was vaccinated. The remaining 25 per cent. represented those who had escaped vaccination through the parents either giving a false address, or removing from the neighbourhood, or claiming exemption under the Vaccination Act, 1907. Before this Act was passed those having conscientious scruples in regard to the value of vaccination may have had some grounds of complaint of the cumbrous way in which exemption was obtained, but now everything has been made easy for the " objector." It is simply necessary for the parent to make a declaration before a Magistrate, or a Justice of the Peace, or before a Commissioner for Oaths (which is the usual way) that, in the parent's opinion, it would be detrimental to the health of the child to have it vaccinated, and exemption is obtained. The exemptions from vaccination have increased five fold in the year, but in less poor districts, I am informed, the number of exemptions has been much greater. It is satisfactory to know that the bulk of the infant population are being efficiently vaccinated. 65 TABLE 32.

Considerable attention has been given during the year to the condition of the Fried Fish Shops. A report was made to the Public Health Committee on their condition and also a special report in regard to the Empire Fried Fish Shop, No. 285 Borough High Street, which will be interesting as shewing the method which has been applied to several of the fried fish shops in the district during the year. The "Empire" Fish Frying Shop, 285, Borough High Street. In regard to fried fish shops generally, the London County Council in its General Powers Act of 1908, Section 9, have power to make by-laws for the regulation of the business of a vendor of fried fish. The London County Council have not yet framed by-laws, and, therefore, it is impossible to say with certainty what will be the requirements of the by-laws when issued. Under sub-section 6 of Section 9, the by-laws will not impose "upon any person any obligation to alter any premises which are at the passing of this Act used for the business of a vendor of fried fish," but "if at any time after the passing of this Act any alteration of any such premises or of any fittings or apparatus therein shall be effected or if any new fittings or apparatus shall be placed or provided therein such alteration shall be carried and such new fittings or apparatus shall be placed and provided in conformity with the requirements of any such bylaw as aforesaid for the time being in force,'' The ideal fish shop in my opinion would be one in which the frying portion of the business, i.e., the furnace and the fish pans, etc., were in a separate room at the back of the shop completely enclosed, the upper part of the enclosure being of framed glass; an exit and an entrance door and a small serving hatch being provided. The furnaces would be placed at each end of the frying structure, the pans to be made of steel widely flanged, with a hood projecting well over the sides and ends of the frying apparatus and brought low down; the sides of the hood converging to an apex at the top communicating with a flue which is brought down so as to terminate at the hearth of the furnace. In the case in question of the "Empire" fish shop, where the frying apparatus is in the middle of the shop, I would advise the whole apparatus being enclosed by a wood and glass partition with entrance and exit doors, and a small serving hatch; the fumes being taken from the top of the hood by means of a ventilating shaft 12 inches in diameter and terminating just above the roof, the upper end of the shaft being fitted with a cowl. This, I am sure, would remove all the nuisance complained of at the present time. 87 In the fish-gutting portion of the premises it is necessary that the floors and the walls should be of impervious material, that the utmost care should be taken in regard to cleanliness and the frequent removal of fish offal, which, whilst on the premises should be stored in properly covered iron bins. I advise the Council to proceed under Section 21 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and as Medical Officer of Health I have served the usual notice upon the occupier of the premises.

Damaged Flour The annexed report made by the Food Inspector shews how difficult it is, in the case of unsound food released for other purposes than human consumption, to be assured that the food in question is used in the way agreed upon at the time of the release. One has to trust to the bona fides of the party to whom the article of unsound food is consigned. May 21 st, 1908. On the 7th instant information was received at the office from Dr. Williams, Medical Officer of Health, Port Sanitary Authority. that a parcel of flour which had become damaged in transit was being forwarded to Messrs. Gordon Coombe & Co., Ltd., Winchester Wharf, Clink Street. The total number of bags of flour was as follows 169 bags marked "Majestic" and 69 bags marked "Sparkle," both ex.s.s. "Mackinaw.'' On their arrival at the wharf they were placed on one side, and on inspection many bags were found in such a foul condition that it was nccessary to thoroughly overhaul each bag. The result of the sorting was as follows :— " Majestic." 17 bags apparently sound externally, but the flour is tainted through being stowed with or near the damaged bags which are also tainted. 39 bags damaged. 113 bags badly damaged. Total 169 bags. " Sparkle.'' 10 bags apparently sound externally, but the flour is tainted through being stowed with or near the damaged bags which are also tainted. 8 bags damaged. 51 bags badly damaged. Total 69 bags. 90 I reported the result of the examination to the Medical Officer of Health, who accompanied me to the wharf and personally inspected the flour. Dr. Miilson agreed that the nature of the damage was such as to render the flour unfit for human food, and ordered a certificate to be sent to the wharfingers, enumerating the defects, and stating, at their request, that whilst the flour was unfit for for human consumption, it might be permitted to be used in the manufacture of cattle food, provided that the owners would inform us as to its destination so that we might satisfy ourselves as to its ultimate disposal. In consequence of that certificate a letter was received on the 2nd instant from Messrs. Grimsdale & Sons, Ltd., 2, Catherine Court, Seething Lane, E,C., stating that they had purchased the consignment for use at their cake mills, Uxbridge, for manufacturing into cattle food, and asking for its release so that the same might be handed over to the Uxbridge Authorities for supervision. According to instructions from the Medical Officer of Health, I went to Uxbridge, and found out that Messrs. Grimsdale were ordinary flour millers doing a large business with flour used in the making of bread as well as cakes for cattle food. In an interview with the Medical Officer of Health for Uxbridge, Dr. J. Lewis Lock, he assured me that the firm was a very respectable one, and he had no doubt but that the flour would be converted into cattle food only. If necessary he could get a guarantee from the firm that such would be the case. On my enquiry as to the likelihood of the flour being mixed with other flour and sold for human food, Dr. Lock gave me to understand that he could only rely on Messrs. Grimsdale & Sons honesty. There was nothing to prevent them mixing it with flour for human food provided it was not too markedly foul. Afterwards I saw Mr. Grimsdale at the Old Corn Exchange, E.C. and in conversation with him on the matter he said we could rely on them using it only mixed with other ingredients in the manufacture of pigs' food. Questioned as to its being coloured so that—whilst retaining its nutritive quality—it could not be sold or used as ordinary flour for household purposes, Mr. Grimsdale said that any kind of colouring would reduce its commercial value to such an extent as to render it practically useless.

Police Court proceedings were taken during 1908 in relation to the following seizures of unsound food.— (1) James Nelson & Sons, Ltd, Tower Bridge Road; selling a leg of mutton which was unfit for human food. In this case proceedings were taken under sub-section 3 of Section 47 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. In the centre of the leg of mutton was a large nodule of caseous material which, in my opinion, was tubercle. Evidence was given by the defendants that the condition of the leg of mutton could not have been perceived with ordinary care by the butcher before it was sold, although I was not of that opinion. The Magistrate held with the defendants and dismissed the summons, allowing 26/costs, as he thought it a very proper case to have been brought before him. (£1 1s. 0d. went to the purchaser.) (2) Leonard Gunstone Hatton, 25 Friar Street, Exposing for sale 4½ pounds beef and mutton which were unfit for human food. The defendant was ordered to pay a fine of £5. with 5/- costs. (3) George Jackson, 11 and 13 Camberwell Road, depositing for the purpose of sale 3¾ cwts of bacon which was unsound and unfit for human food. This case was reported in the press as follows:— "At Lambeth Police Court yesterday, before Mr. Hopkins, George Jackson, a provision dealer in a large way of business at Camberwell Road, was summoned by the Southwark Borough Council for having on July 25th unlawfully deposited for the purpose of sale a quantity of bacon which was intended for food, and which was unsound and unwholesome, and unfit for food. Mr. W. Ricketts supported the summons on behalf of the Council, and Mr. Percy Robinson defended. Mr. Alfred Long, chief sanitary inspector to the Council, stated that on the morning of the 25th July he went to the defendant's premises, accompanied by the Medical Officer of Health, and there saw the defendant. Asked if he had received any bacon that morning the defendant replied that he had, and took them to the back portion of 104 the premises, and pointing to a small van said the bacon was in there, and added that he had not seen it but intended to examine it. Some of the bacon, which consisted of rolls and sides, was taken out of the van for examination. The rolls especially were in a most putrid condition and extremely offensive. The sides were also in bad condition. They smelt very offensively, and in parts were mouldy. He was of opinion that the whole of the bacon was unfit for human consumption. When the defendant saw the rolls unfolded he said to the medical officer " Now, doctor, is it likely that I should offer such stuff as that for sale ? " but, referring to one particular piece of bacon, the defendant said, " That's not so bad. That's fit for sale." The piece referred to smelt offensively to witness. The bacon (weighing 3f cwt.) was seized, and condemned by the Magistrate. Cross-examined by Mr. Robinson, Inspector Long said he could not say how many pieces of bacon were taken out of the van altogether. He thought it was more than one side and four rolls. There was a quantity left on the van which was not examined at all. Dr. George Millson, Medical Officer of Health for Southwark, gave it as his opinion that the bacon was unfit for food. Addressing the Court for the defence, Mr. Robinson reminded the Magistrate that it was admitted that Mr. Jackson at the time said he had not seen this bacon. The stuff was in the van, and was not in a place where it could be sold. Arguing from the decisions in a number of decided cases, which he quoted, Mr. Robinson contended that it could not be said that this bacon was deposited for sale, and that consequently the defendant could not be convicted. Mr. Jackson, the defendant, giving evidence on his own behalf, said he dealt largely of the Danish Bacon Company. He did a good middle class trade, and also a cheap trade. He took over two tons of the best class bacon from the Company every week, and he was also in the habit of purchasing " remnants " from them, which were sent to him on approval. This particular bacon was fetched by the order of his foreman, and up to the time the inspector and medical officer called he (defendant) had not seen it. A green side of the bacon and about four rolls were taken out of the van. The whole of the bacon was not taken out. The rolls were decidedly bad, but the side was not so bad. Green bacon always had a peculiar smell. A gammon he cut off was passable. He had not purchased any of the bacon 105 that was in the van. It was bis practice when such bacon was sent to him to select that which was good and to destroy that which was bad. The Danish Bacon Company were imformed of the result of the examination and a quotation was given to them. In cross-examination by Mr. Bicketts, the defendant said there was only one side amongst the bacon. The rest consisted of rolls and "remnants" (pieces). Rolls had never been sent to him before. He did not deal in them. Replying to a question by the magistrate the defendant said pretty well all the remnants sent to him were saleable. He had never had such stuff as this before. Mr. Carl Hansom, London Manager to the Danish Bacon Company, said the defendant had been in the habit of purchasing the best quality bacon, and also remnants from them. The company sold some 300 or 400 tons of bacon per week, and any goods with which their custoners for any reason were not satisfied were sent back to the company. Two men were enployed at the company's premises to go through such bacon. Bacon which was found to be tainted was sold for manufacturing purposes, and bruised, thick or thin, rejected bacon was sent to Mr. Jackson to do the best he could with. At the time this occurred the men who ordinarily examined the bacon at the company's premises were away. Mr. Hopkins, dealing with the case purely upon the question of law involved, came to conclusion that the defendant was liable to conviction, and imposed a penalty of £20 and £3 3s. cost. The point at issue, his worship said, was a very moot one, which might be raised by way of appeal if Mr. Jackson pleased." (4) John Kilby, 23 Deacon Street, Exposing or depositing for the purpose of sale 11 tins of condensed milk which were unsound and unfit for human food. This summons was adjourned sine die as the defendant satisfied the Magistrate that the business had passed out of his hands. 106 WATER SUPPLY. PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891, Section 48.

December list, 1908. REPORT ON INFORMAL SAMPLING OF FOOD. The practice of buying informal samples was started in this Borough in the latter part of 1901. It was primarily employed only in detecting the illicit sale of margarine which there were reasons to believe was going on, and which the purchasing of official samples had failed to disclose. At a later date the system was extended, and samples were taken for the purpose of testing the genuineness of butter and a few other articles of food on sale when it was inconvenient or inexpedient to take official samples. The utility of taking informal samples has been recognised by the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture, and the practice is now a work of some importance in the administration of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. The majority of the samples which have been taken are those of butter. One of the methods employed in procuring these being to pick out a few shops and send a person two or three times a week to buy at each shop a few articles of food in small quantities. Butter is not always, but is frequently included in the purchases. The buying of these articles is continued for some time at the same shops, three or four weeks being considered long enough as a rule for the buyer to become a regular customer. Finally, official samples are bought from those persons who have been found selling margarine for butter. This completes the period of buying. If any of the shops visited in one period are also visited in the next, another buyer is employed. The buyer is provided with a note book in which to enter the necessary particulars, such as the address of the shop, the time of the visit, the articles bought and the amount paid for each, the person who served, and from what part of the shop the butter was taken by the seller. He is also instructed to write on the wrapper of each sample of butter the address of the shop at which it was purchased before entering another shop. 135 As soon as possible after the purchases are completed, the articles are handed over to the inspector or his assistant. Each sample is divided into two parts, which are sealed, labelled, and numbered. One part is given to the analyst and the other is retained by the inspector. Persons of both sexes are employed as buyers, men are paid 8d. per hour and women 6d. On exceptional occasions, such as going out late on a Saturday night, they are paid a little more. The method pursued in taking what are more strictly "test" samples is similar to that already described except that the shops in general are visited, and only butter is bought. With regard to milk samples, the assistance of a householder is obtained. He enters into a contract with the suspected milkseller to be supplied with genuine milk at the current price. Informal samples of the milk are forwarded to the inspector who submits them to the analyst. When the milk is found not to be up to the standard, an official sample is taken in course of delivery. Samples of other articles of food are procured in much the same manner as samples of butter. There has been no examination of any of the samples except that done by the analyst. The results of his examinations were given verbally until March, 1907, then informal certificates were given until October of this year. Since the latter date the results have been given by certificate similar to those given for official samples. It was not until March, 1904, that information obtained by taking informal samples was occasionally used in the Police Courts—not as evidence of the actual committal of the offence the defendant was summoned for, but after that had been proved as evidence that the offence had been deliberately committed. On the 19th October last the Public Health and Sanitary Committee passed a resolution forbidding such information being used as evidence. This part of the system has consequently been discontinued. There was only a small number of samples bought at the beginning, and it was not until April, 1903, that a record of the purchases was kept. The following table has been compiled from the records since that date:— 136 TABLE 58. Table of informal samples submitted to the Public Analyst from April 23rd, 1903, to Sept. 30th, 1908. Year. Butter. Milk. Coffee. Cheese. Number Submitted. Not Genuine. Percentage not Genuine. Number Submitted. Not Genuine. Percentage not Genuine. Number Submitted. Not Genuine. Percentage not Genuine.

Two samples of milk and water and two of margarine are not included in the table. It should be observed that frequently several non-genuine samples of butter are bought at the same shop during the one period of buying. It also frequently happens that genuine official samples are bought by an agent who has been supplied with margarine in buying informal samples. This may be to some extent due to the buyers being nervous, and flurried when buying officially, but there is the possibility of the inspector having been seen in the neighbourhood of the shop by the shopkeeper or his assistants, or by some busybody who promptly intimated the fact to the shopkeeper. This I know has occurred. Sometimes at the same shop one person will supply butter when butter is asked for, while another person will supply margarine. In one of those shops butter was kept on a shelf in full view of the buyer, and the margarine was kept under the counter. But even if the official sample be genuine, there has been some good done by the purchases, The shopkeeper is made aware of the fact that he is being looked after, and if it does not stop his dishonesty, it will cause him to restrain his tendency to that form of trading. The samples of butter shown in the table have been bought in 20 periods of sampling, arising out of which there have been 33 convictions. In 11 periods women were employed as buyers, and in nine men were employed. One woman engaged on one shop only did not get a bad sample. Another, who was supplied with margarine at several shops while buying informally, was supplied with butter when she bought the official samples. Four of the men were not supplied with any but genuine samples. The buyers have to be frequently changed, and it is not easy to find persons suitable for the work. There is not much doubt that most, if not all of those convicted have been guilty of deliberate fraud, carried out with so much caution and cunning that, but for the informal sampling, it would probably not have been found out. 138 One unsuspected tradesman at whose shop genuine official samples had been bought on an average of about one a year for six years, was found by informal sampling to be selling margarine for butter. After the discovery he was convicted four times within two years. Another whose business methods were not above suspicion, although 15 official samples had been purchased at his shop in five years, was not brought to book until after we began to take informal samples. Defendants are quite justified in making the most of their record; but when a defendant declares that the offence for which he is summoned is the result of an accident and refers to the number of genuine samples (official) which have been taken as a proof of it, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the magistrate generally accepts his explanation, even when there has been a previous conviction. At the same time the prosecution may know from informal samples having been taken at his shop that he had been selling margarine for butter for some time before the official sample, which is the subject of the summons, was taken. There may be a doubt as to whether or not such information can be given in evidence, but there can be none about it being helpful to the Magistrate in determining the true character of the offence. With regard to this Borough it was a Magistrate who first of all elicited this information, and, although I have heard such evidence given many times, I have never heard a Magistrate object. The purchase of informal samples of milk has not been very encouraging. It is very difficult to get a householder who is both suitable and willing to undertake the buying. It has been tried in three or four instances, but only one conviction followed. There is reason to believe that in the other cases the fact that the milk was being bought for the inspector leaked out. It is the only practical way, however, of dealing with a particular method of selling adulterated milk. JAS. WEATHERITT, Food and Drugs Inspector.
