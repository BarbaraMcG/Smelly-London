Urban District Council of Wood Green. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1906. To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Wood Green. Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you my Report on the Health of Wood Green for the year 1906. NEW BUILDINGS. The total number of dwelling houses in course of erection during the year was 1,149. Of these, 758 were completed for occupation, the remaining 391 being incomplete at the end of the year. 4 In addition to the above, the following buildings have been erected:— Factories and Warehouses 3 Stables and Sheds 8 Public Buildings 6 Alterations and additions to existing Buildings 22 Lock-up Shops and Offices 2 Bakehouse 1 Total 42 The total number of plans laid before the Council was 135, of which 110 were approved and 25 disapproved, the approved plans representing 656 dwelling houses, 2 factories and warehouses, 13 stables and sheds, 6 public buildings, 38 alterations and additions to existing buildings, 3 lock-up shops and offices, 1 bakehouse, the construction and sewering of 4 new roads, and the extension of 1 existing road with its necessary sewer and surface water drains. POPULATION. The total number of completed houses in December, 1906, was 9,127. Allowing 7 per cent. for empty houses, and calculating 5.66 persons to each occupied house, the Population at the end of the year would be 48,047. By a similar calculation the Population in December, 1905, was 44,091. The mean of these numbers—46,059—would represent the population in June, 1906, and I have taken 46,000 as the average Population of the District for the present Report. BIRTHS. 1,232 Births were registered during the year, 620 boys and 612 girls, which correspond to an annual rate of 26.78 per 1,000 of the population. 5 DEATHS. 420 Deaths were registered in the District during the year. Through the kindness of the County Medical Officer of Health I have obtained a list of 80 deaths of residents that occurred outside the District, including— Edmonton Infirmary 21 Napsbury Asylum 6 Islington Infirmary 2 Great Northern Hospital 5 Convent Hospital, Shoreditch 1 Tottenham Hospital 6 Cheyne Hospital 1 University College Hospital 3 London Hospital 2 Fredenheim 1 St. Bartholomew's 2 North-Eastern Children's Hospital 1 Hampstead General Hospital 1 Middlesex Hospital 2 Charing Cross Hospital 1 Metropolitan Hospital 1 Brompton Hospital 1 St. Peter's Hospital 1 Royal Free Hospital 1 St. Luke's House 1 46, Packington Street, Islington 1 Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich 1 St. Ann's House, Stoke Newington 1 Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street 5 Finsbury Park Station 1 Enfield Isolation Hospital 3 Hornsey Isolation Hospital 6 The total number is 500, from which is deducted 12 deaths of non-residents, 11 of which occurred in the Passmore Edwards Hospital. 6 The corrected number is therefore 488, which is equal to an annual rate of 10.60 per 1,000 of the estimated population. The average death rate for the previous 10 years was 11.66. To compare this death rate with that of England and Wales, allowance must be made for the more favourable age and sex distribution of the population of Wood Green. This is done by multiplying the recorded death rate by a "factor for correction" (in our case 1.09801), a figure obtained by the Medical Officer of Health for the County by a somewhat elaborate calculation, founded on the figures of the last Census. The corrected death rate for Wood Green is 11.63 for the year 1906. There were 127 deaths of children under 1 year, which corresponds to a rate of 103 deaths for every 1,000 births. The average for the previous ten years was 131 deaths to every 1,000 births. The deaths of children under 5 years was 181, which is equal to a rate of 3.93 per 1,000 of the general population, against 3'36 and 488 per 1,000 in the two previous years. There were 43 deaths from various forms of Tubercular Disease, 35 of which were from Phthisis, against 34 and 44 in the two previous years. There were 64 deaths from diseases of the Respiratory System, against 73 and 56 for the two previous years. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The deaths from the seven chief Zymotic diseases of the Registrar-General (Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Fever, and Diarrhoea) were 81, which corresponds to an annual rate of 1 76 per 1,000, against 106 per 1,000 in 1905. No case of Smallpox or of Typhus was notified during the year. SCARLET FEVER. 224 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified with 7 deaths, against 118 cases with 1 death in 1905. 7 DIPHTHERIA. 74 cases of Diphtheria were notified with 9 deaths, against 77 cases with 8 deaths in 1905. The following table gives the number of cases of Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever at particular Schools. SCHOOLS ATTENDED. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria. Noel Park. Boys 6 1 Girls 6 1 Infants 10 8 22 10 White Hart Lane. Boys 3 5 Girls 13 3 Infants 9 9 25 17 Higher Grade. Boys 8 — Girls 8 — 16 — Bounds Green. Boys 3 2 Girls 1 4 Infants 12 1 16 7 Alexandra. Boys 5 — Girls 7 — Infants 19 1 31 1 8 Lordship Lane (Mixed) 1 — S. Michael's. Boys 2 — Girls 5 — Infants 3 — 10 — St. Paul's (Mixed) 2 2 Private Schools 20 1 No Schools 80 36 Boys 1 — S. Michael's (Tottenhall Road) 1 — The fact that the average attendance is the basis on which the Education grant is given tends to cause an undue influence to be exercised on parents to send their children to School when in an unfit state. To a certain extent there is an antagonism between the interests of the public health and the apparent interest of the Education Authority, and an utterly illogical and improper magnification of the importance of a high average attendance as a test of efficiency is caused. All the recent contributions to the questions of National Education of any value emphasize the paramount importance of securing the highest possible physical development of the children, and I hope the Council will discourage any attempt to suggest that the average attendance of Scholars, whether high or low, reflects the slightest credit or discredit on the Masters or Mistresses in charge of any particular School. The Masters and Mistresses should be relieved of any responsibility in this matter and their time and energy devoted to the far more valuable and important duties of their profession. 9 TYPHOID FEVER. 16 cases of Typhoid Fever with 1 death were notified, against 18 cases with 1 death in 1905. MEASLES. There were 3 deaths from Measles, against 6 in 1905. DIARRŒHA. There were 52 fatal cases of Diarrhoea, 43 of which were in children under 1 year, against 13 fatal cases in 1905. WHOOPING COUGH. There were 9 fatal cases of Whooping Cough in children under 5 years, against 17.in 1905. There were 36 cases of Erysipelas notified with no deaths, against 27 cases with no deaths in 1905. 7 deaths were attributed to Influenza as a primary cause, against 6 deaths in 1905. ISOLATION HOSPITAL. During the year the following 194 cases have been removed to the various hospitals:— Scarlet. Diphtheria. Typhoid. Hornsey Isolation Hospital 106 36 4 Enfield „ „ 28 15 — Southgate „ „ 5 — — 139 51 4 Under the Agreement entered into with the Hornsey Council in June, 1905, our patients are to be received and treated for an inclusive sum of £1 17s. 6d. a week. In addition we have paid £2,400 towards the cost of the necessary enlargement of the Hornsey Hospital, and have agreed to pay a further sum of £1,200 in four annual instalments of £300. The Agreement is for 10 years and provided that Wood Green shall be repaid £1,000 if, at the end of this period, Hornsey finds 10 itself unable or unwilling to extend it for a further period of five years. The practice has been, during the past year, for a Committee of the Council to go through a list of the patients who have been removed to the Hospital, and to apply to the parents or guardians for the whole or part of the cost if there was evidence that the expense could be afforded. I think it will be found that the difficulty of collection and unpopularity of such charges will be quite incommensurate with the sum actually received. As in previous years, "specimens" of doubtful cases of Diphtheria and Typhoid Fever have been sent for bacteriological examination, the requisite materials being supplied free. AntiDiphtheric Serum has been supplied to Medical Practitioners in urgent cases of Diphtheria, a supply of the latter being kept at the Town Hall, at the residences of the Medical Officer of Health and Chief Sanitary Inspector, so that when the offices are closed no unnecessary delay may be caused, and this has been found to be a great convenience. Tubes of Anti-Diphtheric Serum supplied 26 Bacteriological Examinations 36 COST OF ISOLATION. The cost of Isolating Infectious Cases for the year ending 31st December, 1906, was as follows:— £ s. d. Passmore Edwards Hospital 19 5 0 Enfield Isolation Hospital 629 13 0 Southgate Isolation Hospital 55 13 0 Ambulance Horse Hire 11 3 0 Hornsey Isolation Hospital— Contribution £300 0 0 Maintenance of Patients 1094 19 10 - 1394 19 10 £2110 13 10 11 The average cost per patient was £10 17s. 7d. The average time of Isolation in Hospital:— Scarlet Fever 46.04 days. Diphtheria 26.31„ INFANTILE DIARRHŒA, The Circular which I printed in my last Annual Report has been left at every house from which a Birth is Registered, the lists being supplied each week by the Registrar, and I am glad to say, so far as I can judge, it has been appreciated. In several instances, where Parents have mislaid the Circular, application has been made for another to be sent. The question of the appointment of a Lady Health Visitor has been brought under the notice of the Council, and is receiving the consideration of the Health and Sanitary Committee. DUST DESTRUCTOR. It is to be regretted that an omission in the Local Act of 1903 has caused delay in proceeding with the erection of the Dust Destructor. It has been manifest for some time that it was impossible to provide a dust shoot in the immediate neighbourhood that would not cause a nuisance. The present site was selected as being least optn to objection, and as a purely temporary expedient pending the erection of the Destructor. Being on the extreme boundary of the District, New Southgate was chiefly affected, and the Southgate Council was naturally obliged to take steps to remedy the nuisance that was caused. At a cost of considerable trouble and labour the flagrant nuisance was abated, and the deposit of refuse was allowed to continue at a site a little removed from the original one. I am glad to say that all difficulties have now been overcome, and there is every prospect of the Destructor being in working order before the end of the present year. 12 GENERAL SANITARY WORK. The general Sanitary work of the District has been efficiently performed, the details of which will be found in the Sanitary Inspector's Report. The following number of Houses were inspected during the course of House-to-House Inspection:— Park Ridings 30 Acacia Road 47 Winkfield Road 79 Bradley Road 18 Sussex Terrace 7 Brabant Road 25 Total 206 I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, C.

Town Hall, Wood Green, January, 1907. To the Chairman and Members of the Wood Green Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report of the Work in this Department during the year ending December 31st, 1906. There has been 126 Complaints received at the office of various nuisances. As in previous years I have included under the head of Special Complaints all nuisances found, except those of House to House Inspection, which appear under that head in another column.

There have been 7 applications to be registered under the above Order during the year. Of these 5 were transfer of businesses, and 2 new application, all of which have been granted. It is unfortunate that Local Authorities are bound to register all applicants for registration quite apart from the state of the premises from which the milk is sold or stored, or whether the premises are suitable for storage of milk. This absurdity has been illustrated in a small way during the year, in the case of a person who was registered for the sale of milk, but as he also stored paraffin oil and other like sundries in the same place as the milk, he was called upon to make certain alterations, or he would be summoned for contravention of the Bye-laws, fortunately for all concerned, he preferred to give up the sale of milk. There are five registered cowkeepers in the district with 9 cows between them ; and, as I remarked last year, the cows are kept for advertising purposes. Alterations have been effected in two of the cowsheds, the floors pavei and drained, ventilation provided, and brought generally more up to date. I am pleased to say this was done without any notice from the Council. Two cases of infectious disease occurred in milkshops during the year, but prompt removal of the patients, and the co-operation of the occupiers in carrying out the stringent measures advised, prevented the spread to even other members of the same family. 24 Having regard to the importance of a pure milk supply, especially with respect to infantile mortality, it is a matter of surprise that an Act has not been made whereby all Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops would have to be Certificated by the Local Authorities before being allowed to sell an article of such vital importance. There is no doubt that Urban Districts have during the past few • years put in force all the powers given them with respect to the Milk Trade, but it requires the co-operation of Rural Districts at the source of supply, and Carriers in the Transit, before the problem of a purer Milk Supply is solved. All of us have seen the Country Cowshed, with its cobble-stone floor, its dark, unventilated condition, and the malodorous smell from the adjacent manure heap without any proper dung-pit, the Cows milked by the picturesque Men and Maidens straight from various duties, without any attempt at cleansing, to send the " New Pure Milk " to its various destinations, is it any wonder that Municipal Authorities are driven to Municipal Dairies, &c., to give the children a proper and sufficient Milk Supply? The number carrying on the Sale of Milk on the 31st December, 1906, were as follows:— FOUR COWKEEPERS. 1. A. R. Abbott, Station Road. 2. R. Broomfield, 57, Commerce Road. - 3. J. Gower, Redvers Road. 4. David Sexton, Stuart Crescent. THIRTY-EIGHT PURVEYORS OF MILK. 1. Anderson, George, 39, Richmond Road. 2. Bennett, Henry, 1a, Warberry Road. 3. Cox, F.

Number of Visits, 188. (Milkshops, 153 ; Cowsheds, 35). 26 SLAUGHTER HOUSES AND FOOD INSPECTION. There are five Registered Premises in the District as follows:— Wm. Knight, 301, High Road. G. H. Brown, 103, High Road. E. A. Fillary, 45, Finsbury Road. F. G. Jones, 141, Myddleton Road. All the above Slaughter Houses were Registered by the Tottenham Local Board before the separation of the District, and so far as their construction will permit have been kept throughout the year in a clean and well-ordered condition. One Slaughter House is simply used for killing a few sheep during the summer ; the visits to this Slaughter House have not been so numerous as the others where slaughtering is carried on all the year round. My visits have been timed so far as possible when slaughtering was in progress, so that an examination could be made of the carcase, &c. On the 27th February last I found the carcase of a cow suffering from Tuberculosis ; the whole carcase and organs were affected, and as this carcase was being dressed in the Slaughter House I seized the same together with all the organs, had the aame condemned by a Magistrate, and took proceedings against the occupier of the Slaughter House, who was fined £5 and costs, or one month. I also had the Slaughter House thoroughly cleansed and lime-whited before any more slaughtering was carried out. Number of visits to Slaughter Houses, 128. The Butchers', Fruit and Fish Shops have been visited at frequent intervals, particular attention having been given to the Saturday night trade, and it is pleasing to record that no seizures have been necessary. In one or two instances fruit has been exposed which was not quite as it should be, but has been immediately destroyed when I have pointed out the quality of the same. Upon 27 the whole I find the Tradesmen anxious to work in harmony with the department in the direction of the Inspection of Food, &c., and the following have been surrendered:— 1 Pig (with Tubercle). 1 Cwt. of Meat. 1 Box of Kippered Herrings. 1 Trunk of Mackerel. 12 Pigs' Bellies. 8 Sheeps' Plucks. My attention has been called by purchasers to 1 leg of mutton and 1 rabbit, both of which were unfit for human food, but both the purchasers refused to support the Council in any proceedings they might order. I was obliged to let the matter drop, except to make a special inspection of the goods on the premises concerned, but failed to find any further cause for complaint. REMOVAL OF HOUSE REFUSE. No. of Complaints and Requisitions 34 „ Loads Removed 8049 „ Visits-to Carts on District 2150 „ Carts employed 9 Over 600 more loads of Refuse have been removed during the year than in 1905, due to the growth of the neighbourhood, particularly the Eastern portion, and at the back of the Alexandra Palace. When the contemplated Dust Destructor has been erected, the work of Dust Collection will need re-organisation, with a view to an economy of the men's time in going to Shoot; the present Shoot is almost at the extreme end of the District (toward New Southgate)—consequently a good deal of time is lost in Shooting, which I anticipate will be saved by the Destructor being in a more convenient position, and I am hoping, that although the District will further develop, the number of carts will not need increasing. 28 FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901. The following is a list of the Workshops in the District, together with the number of persons employed at times of visits:— Business. No. in District No. of persons employed. Visits.

The occupiers of Bakehouses, while paying attention to walls, ceilings, &c., neglect the condition of the floors, and it is with great difficulty that they can be impressed that the sweeping and cleansing of the floors are just as important as any other part of the premises. I repeat the opinion expressed last year, that all Bakehouses and other places where human food is manufactured or stored ought to be certified by the Local Authority before being so used. The mere Registration (that has been proposed) does not deal with the root of the matter, although useful in so far as it brings these places under the notice of the Local Authority. ICE CREAM DEALERS. Forty-eight premises have been visited where Ice Cream is made and stored, and a handbill left with the occupier setting forth the provisions of the Wood Green District Council's Act, 1903, with respect to the Manufacture, &c., of Ice Cream. In one case we had to call attention to the dirty state of walls, ceilings, and floor of room in which Ice Cream was made at the rear of a small retail shop, and it was with some difficulty we got the premises cleansed. Nearly all the premises are shops from which Ice Cream is retailed in glasses; there are no wholesale manufacturers. CLERICAL WORK.

This is due in a great measure to the reorganisation of the offices and being without the services of a Second Assistant for two months. Of course, it must not be inferred that all the houses inspected and reported as "No Nuisances existing" are in a thoroughly Sanitary condition, but means that on the date of visit no Nuisance for which a Notice could be served under the Public Health Acts existed on the premises inspected, and I think the Council are to be congratulated on their policy of House Inspection as exemplified in the Report. I feel that it should be placed on record that as a rule the occupiers of houses do not place any difficulty in the way of the Inspectors going through their premises. This to my mind tends to show that the knowledge of Sanitation with respect to the people's health, which is the people's wealth, is becoming recognised more and more as Education advances ; indeed, our experience teaches us that the public mind is in advance of the antiquated Public Health Act, 1875, under which so much of our work has to be done, our attention being constantly called to dangerous stairs, broken banister rails, smoky kitchen ranges, &c., which we cannot touch. 32 GENERAL. The year 1906 has been somewhat of an eventful one in the Department. The Council recognised that the Department was growing not only in work but in importance, and various changes were made. A Health and Sanitary Committee were appointed at the Annual Meeting of the Council in April last to deal specially with matters connected with the Department and other duties set forth in the Year Book. The Department was moved to more commodious offices, where there is room to store records and to give proper accommodation to the Staff and callers. The change of office and reorganisation entailed a great amount of clerical work in adjusting accounts, orders, &c., which had previously been put through another Department; and the appointment by the Council of an Accountant meant a further adjustment of accounts, so that it has been impossible to give the time to outdoor work as in previous years; but everything is now in order, and I hope that the work of the coming year will prove that the changes made will be beneficial to the District generally. The Department has also been placed in direct Telephonic communication with the Exchange, thus obviating the delay that prevailed in dealing with the speedy removal of Infectious Cases, as well as great convenience to persons having business with the Department. Mr. Moffatt, one of the Assistant Inspectors, resigned in the latter part of August to take up duty as Inspector to the District Council of Kingswinford. In October Mr. Ainley, of Huddersfield, was appointed in Mr. Moffatt's place, commencing duty on the 5th November, 1906. He came with excellent testimonials from the Health Department, Huddersfield, and I have no doubt he will prove a capable officer. 33 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. Nature. Breach of Commons Bye-laws (Gipsy).
