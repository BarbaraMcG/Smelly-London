( By Order) FREDERICK AVELING, Vestry Clerk. Vestry Hall, Harrow Road; 16th July, 1864. SANITARY REPORT for the year 18 6 3-64. by J. BURDON-SANDERSON, M.D., Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, Assistant Physician to Middlesex Hospital, and formerly Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Consumption medical officer of health. REPORT TO THE VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Gentlemen, I have the honor to present the usual Annual Summary of the proceedings of the Vestry and of the Sanitary Committee, in the administration of the powers conferred upon them by the Metropolis Local Management Act, and other Statutes, for the preservation of the public health. During the year preceding December 31st, 1863, 479 Orders for the improvement of houses, or for the removal of nuisances, were issued by the Sanitary Committee, all of which were eventually complied with. In one instance only, of which the particulars are stated in the following paragraph, it was found necessary to take proceedings under the 73rd Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, for the construction of new house drains. 12 On the 18th of June I presented a report on the bad sanitary condition of a block of dwellings, consisting of the houses Nos. 29— 48, North Wharf Road, and Nos. 2 — 20, Dudley Street. It was therein stated that the houses in question had been for many years notoriously liable to the invasion of epidemics, and to the prevalence of those diseases which are the known products of sanitary neglect: and that although this unhealthiness arose in part from the social condition of the inhabitants, it was equally attributable to the bad construction and dilapidated state of the houses. It was shewn that they were wanting in the commonest appliances of cleanliness, and that the water closets and dustbins were in the foulest condition and of the rudest description. Most of the inlets to the drains were untrapped, so that sewer air escaped freely. In North Wharf Road, particularly, the drains were so imperfect, that even if traps had been provided, mephitic exhalations would still have escaped through the interstices of the crumbling brick work. All the houses were the property of one individual who had been repeatedly urged to put them in a proper sanitary state, but had on each occasion contented himself with the mere abatement of pressing nuisances,without complying with the requirements of the Committee as to constructive improvements. It therefore appeared necessary to take more stringent measures; notice was 13 served specifying in detail the works required in three of the worst cases, and informing the owner that in the event of his failing to comply within twenty eight days, the Vestry would cause these works to be executed at his expense. This notice not having been attended to within the time specified, new drains were constructed under the superintendence of the Surveyor, and the expenses recovered. It was hoped that in this limited exercise of their compulsory powers the Sanitary Committee had taken a course which would lead to the improvement of the whole property. This hope was not however realized, and on the 17th of December, I had again occasion to report unfavourably as to the houses Nos. 2— 20, in Dudley Street; the Committee thereupon resolved to make a personal inspection, in consequence of which the owner was required to pave or re-instate the pavement of the yard in each of these houses, to provide proper traps for the inlets to the drains, and to erect a sufficient number of covered cisterns, fitted with suitable selfclosing valves, and water-supply pipes at a sufficient height for the effectual scouring of the water closets. The works not having been carried out, I was authorized on the 4th of February to place the matter in the hands of the Vestry Solicitor. The further steps which were taken, and their results, will be related in my next Annual Statement. 14 During the year ending last Lady-Day, the Sanitary Inspector was authorized to take proceedings at the Metropolitan Police Courts, in the following instances:—On the 4th of June, complaint was made against the occupier of No. 13 Wharf, in respect of leakage from his slop-shoot into an adjoining dwelling house; on the 18th it was reported that the nuisance had been abated by the construction of efficient drainage. On the 2nd of July, a similar course was taken with respect to an undue accumulation of green refuse on the premises of Mr. W. Meade, Nos. 5 and 6 Wharf, South Side; on the 16th, the nuisance had been abated. On the same day, proceedings were commenced against the occupier of a Licensed Slaughter-house in Celbridge Mews, in respect of the offensive and unlawful occupation of his premises for tripe boiling. On the 6th of August it was reported that the defendant having given a written promise that the practice should be discontinued, (which promise he has since punctually fulfilled) no further steps were taken. On the same day, I reported on the offensive condition of No. 7 Salem Gardens, the Water Closet and Drain leading therefrom being dilapidated, and so foul as to be a nuisance. Notice had been served upon the owner for the improvement of the premises three months previously, and on the 13th of July he had been requested to attend the Sanitary Committee to shew cause why he 15 should not be compelled to comply with their order. As he did not attend on this occasion, proceedings were taken in the usual manner; the case was heard on the 13th of August, when it appeared that the work had been commenced an hour before. At an adjourned hearing on the 20th it was stated, that the work had been completed; on payment of costs by the defendant, the matter terminated. On the 15th of October, notice of proceedings was served on the owner of No. 9 Iron Gate Wharf, in respect of the foul state of his premises; on the 5th of November it was reported that the nuisance had been abated. On the 18th of December, a similar notice was served in respect to No. 1, in the same street, for the abatement of over-crowding, which was also complied with. On the 17th of March, similar steps were taken for the abatement of a nuisance arising from defective drainage of the house No. 3 Newton Terrace. In consequence, a new drain was constructed. On the 17th of December, the provisions of the 67th Section of the Paddington Local Act were enforced against the occupier of certain building ground near Ledbury Road, in respect of the unlawful burning of ballast within 500 yards of inhabited dwellings. On the 7th of January the unlawful occupation of an underground 16 ing, at 117, Praed Street, was put a stop to by the enforcement of the 103rd Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act. The Canal Basin. On the 4th of June, the attention of the Sanitary Committee was again called to the foul state of the Canal Basin. As the days became longer, and the weather warmer, the evil increased, the water becoming blacker and more offensive, and the air in the neighbourhood more widely impregnated with its disgusting odour. Towards the end of the month I visited all the migratory families inhabiting the barges, and found that many of the women and children were suffering from alvine disorders; in one boat I found a child dying of gastric fever. On the 6th of July, a Special Meeting of the Sanitary Committee was held for the purpose of taking the subject into consideration. It appeared that during the previous week (July 2nd) the Basin had been emptied of water, and then re-filled with beneficial effect. In consideration of this, the Committee thought it not desirable to take further proceedings against the Company, but instructed me to request the Vestry Clerk to convene a Special Meeting, in case the state of the Basin should render it necessary. On the 16th, the Secretary of the Grand Junction Canal Company attended the Sanitary Committee, and stated, that it was the desire of the Company to meet 17 their wishes in every respect, and that it was their intention to cleanse the Basin effectually next winter. He further stated that they were anxious to repeat the process of renewing the water whenever their supply rendered it possible, but that they had had to encounter serious difficulties from the course taken by the Metropolitan Board of Works, who insisted on requiring them to give forty-eight hours notice before allowing the water to flow into the sewers; it frequently happened, that at the expiration of this period the opportunity which existed at the time the notice was given had passed away. In consideration of this statement, the Vestry Clerk was directed to write to the Metropolitan Board of Works, pointing out to them how important it was to the health of this parish that the Basin should be frequently emptied, and requesting them, with a view to facilitate this object, to allow the Grand Junction Canal Company to run off their water through the sewers under their control at a shorter notice than forty-eight hours. To this request the Board declined to accede in consideration" of the necessity of making effectual and timely arrangements for the protection of the lives of the men working in the Main Sewers." * • On Monday, March 28th, I received a statement from the Secretary of the Company to the effect that they would cleanse the whole of the Basin in the most complete manner during the following month. This operation was carried out to my entire satisfaction in the week ending May 28th. 18 At the same Meeting, another question at issue between the Committee and the Company was discussed, viz.:— the suggestion made to the Company by me on the 9th of July, 1858, and repeated on several occasions subsequently, that the levels of the weir should be so altered that the whole of the water flowing in at the west end should be discharged at the extreme or east end of the Basin in such a manner as to produce a current along its whole length. It having been replied on the part of the Company that in the opinion of their Engineer there were serious engineering difficulties in the way of the proposed alteration, it was agreed that a conference should take place on the subject, between this gentleman and the Surveyor of the Vestry. In consequence of this conference, my suggestion was shortly afterwards partially carried out. The water is not now discharged near the entrance as formerly ; some of it escapes at the east end, but the remainder is allowed to pass out by an outlet about half way down, so that the foulest part of the Basin receives the benefit of a certain proportion only of the available current. Conveyance of Persons suffering from Smallpox, and other contagious diseases. The visitation of Smallpox which began in the winter of 1863-4, increased in the following 19 spring, continued during the summer, and slowly declined during the autumn and winter. The numbers that died in the quarters of the year ending last Lady-day, stated successively, were 10, 5, 4 and 2 in Paddington,—788, 512, 214 and 161 in London. Although these numbers are very inconsiderable as compared either with the total mortality of which they form part, or with the mortality from various other epidemic diseases which attract much less attention, they represent a large amount of distress and misery; for while ample provision is made by public charity for the gratuitous reception and treatment of the poor when suffering from any of the diseases of every-day prevalence, no such provision exists for those who take smallpox. If a man is attacked by any other deadly or dangerous illness, hospitals are accessible to him in every part of London; but if he be so unfortunate as to contract smallpox, every door of relief is closed. There is but one small hospital, situated at Highgate, into which he may be admitted, on payment of the proper fee, if there is room. At the date of my last report, a carriage for the removal of persons suffering from contagious diseases had been ordered by the Vestry, which was to be constructed expressly for the 20 purpose, with a view to the safety and comfort of the patient. As soon as the carriage was completed, arrangements were made for placing it gratuitously at the disposal of the inhabitants, and every effort was employed to render these arrangements as public as possible. Notice boards, on which it was announced that application could be made at any time to the Hall-keeper, at the Vestry Hall, for the use of the carriage, were fixed in the most prominent situations, and hand-bills containing the same information were widely distributed. Notwithstanding these measures, there is reason to believe that the object they were intended to accomplish,— the removing of infected persons from densely populated districts without delay, was unattained. As it was evident that this failure no longer arose from the difficulty of obtaining fit conveyance, but rather from the uncertainty and expense attendant on the reception of patients into the hospital, no further steps could be taken. Cow-houses and Slaughter-houses. On the 15th of October, I submitted to the Sanitary Committee a list of persons who had given notice of their intention to apply for Licences to use their premises either as Cowhouses or Slaughter-houses, and presented a report on these premises, from which it appeared 21 that the working of the provisions of the Metropolis Management Act Amendment Act, relating to Cow-houses, had been satisfactory. The Cowhouses had been much improved, and the keeping of Cows much diminished by the wholesome restrictions to which the occupiers had been subjected. On the 26th of October, I attended the Special Sessions for granting Licences, and stated to the Magistrates in respect of each case the manner in which the regulations of the Vestry had been carried out. Licences were accorded to all the applicants. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. BURDON-SANDERSON. TABLE I. WORKS COMPLETED UNDER ORDERS ISSUED DURING THE YEARS 1856—1863.

REPORT OF THE WORKS EXECUTED IN THE SEWERS DEPARTMENT. Bv WILLIAM MERRY, SURVEYOR. REPORT Vestry Hall, Paddington, 16th July, 1864. Gentlemen, In compliance with the requirements of the 198th Section of the "Metropolis Local Management Act," I have the honor to submit my Eighth Annual Report of the Works executed in the Sewers Department from the 25th March, 1863, to the 25th March, 1864, inclusive. During the past year seventy Notices have been received for the erection of 393 New Buildings, viz.:— one Factory, 316 Houses, and seventysix Stables, in compliance with the requirements of the 76th Section of the "Metropolis Local Management Actand thirty-six applications have been made and granted for the re-construction of Drains under the public footpaths and roadways to forty-four Houses and Premises. These were rendered necessary in consequence of Notices issued by the Sanitary and Public Health Com- 32 mittee, or were executed at the suggestion of the Owners of the respective Buildings. In every case where Cesspools and common Privies previously existed, they have been destroyed and Water Closets substituted. The following Sewers have been constructed in the places undermentioned, at the expense of the Owners of Property : — ft. ft. in. ft. in. Clarendon Street .... 1253 run 3 . 9 by 2 . 6 whole Brick Sewer.

Pipe. Oxford Mews 120 „ 9 ditto Two side entrances and four man-holes to 33 Sewers have been made. Eighty-seven Gulley Drains have been constructed in different parts of the Parish for the purpose of carrying off the surface water, and 109 repaired. Total length of Brick Sewer constructed, 7815 feet run. Total length of Drain Pipe laid down, 5 miles, 212 yards. The value of these works I estimate at £9,000. About 1 mile of Brick Sewers, in which the deposit varied from two to nine inches in depth, have been thoroughly cleansed, the hard deposit which could not be removed by flushing was raised to the surface and carried away in carts. Seventeen hundred and thirty-four Gulley Drains and Sandpits have also been cleansed. Jobbing Works, comprising 454 separate and distinct works, such as the repair of Sewers and Gullies, fixing Traps and other works connected therewith, have been executed by the Contractor to the Vestry, to the value of £1812: 19:6. This amount includes the sum of £524: 13: 11 received from Owners of Property for fixing Traps at outlets of existing Drains, constructing Gullies, and laying Drain Pipes under thoroughfares taken to by the Parish. 34 In addition to the foregoing details, I beg to state that 163 complaints on subjects connected with the Sewers Department have been received ; they had reference to stoppages in Sewers, Gullies, Drains, &c. With respect to stoppages in Drains leading into Brick Sewers, they have either been removed from the inside of the Sewer, or the complainant has been informed of the exact spot where the stoppage has occurred; and thus expense and annoyance in stripping the Drain has been obviated. This information is furnished free of expense to every Rate-payer. It has been my uniform practice to give immediate attention to such matters ; and I have succeeded either in removing the cause of complaint, or have been enabled to suggest a remedy for the evils brought under my consideration. Re-Naming Streets, and Re-Numbering Houses.

I believe that all the information which it is in my power to furnish has now been condensed into this Report, which I venture most respectfully to submit to your indulgent attention. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM MERRY, SURVEYOR. 1864.

No. 9. REPORT on the HEALTH OF PADDINGTON DURING THE HALF-YEAR ENDING LADY-DAY, 18 6 3, BY J. BURDON SANDERSON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE VESTRY. Population of Paddington, April, 1861 75,807. Vestry Hall; May, 1863. During the six Months ending March 28th the mortality of the Metropolis was high; 61 in every 10,000 of the population died in the last quarter of 1862, and 65 in the first quarter of 1863. In Paddington the quarterly death rates were also higher than usual, being 50 per 10,000 for October, November, and December, and 54 per 10,000 for January, February, and March. If, however, the prevalence of fatal disease had been as great during the six months referred to in Paddington as in the rest of London, the loss of life would have been greater than it actually was by 182. The increased mortality occurred for the most part in the beginning of the winter ; it was mainly due to the unusual prevalence of scarlatina in November, December, and January, in which months no less than 74 children died of this disease. As regards 45 of these children, it may be inferred from their places of residence that their parents occupied such a social position as to be beyond the reach of those sanitary evils which are associated with destitution. Scarlatina was just twice as fatal in Paddington as in the rest of the Metropolis, certainly not because Paddington is less healthy, but because scarlatina is not one of those diseases which are dependent upon bad drainage, over-crowding or other local causes. Small pox has been fatal to six persons, two of whom were unvaccinated adults, the rest young children. In the whole of London the deaths from this cause amounted during the last quarter to 422, or 1.4 per 10,000. As compared with this proportion, the mortality in Paddington was only 0.4, so that it amounted to of the whole number of deaths in the Parish, and 1/17 of the mortality from scarlatina. During the last month the disease has spread somewhat more rapidly, but its attacks have been confined to streets inhabited by persons who, from their mode of life, and their reckless disregard for all precautions, are particularly liable to contagion. The measures which have been taken to arrest further progress of smallpox have consisted in the circulation of printed hand-bills, setting forth in homely language the necessity of vaccination, and warning the people of the consequences of neglect, and in visiting from house to house those streets and places in which small pox is likely to prevail, or cases have already occurred, for the purpose of seeing that the people avail themselves of the facilities which are offered them for vaccination. What remains to be done is to provide for the reception and treatment of persons suffering from the disease. On this subject a circular has been issued by the Medical Officers of Health of the Metropolis, in which they express the opinion that "whenever a case of smallpox occurs in a populous locality the patient ought, in the interests of public health, to be removed as soon as possibleand advise that "temporary buildings should be opened in such situations as may be best suited for the purpose." The number of persons who have as yet been attacked in this Parish is comparatively so limited that such advice may appear to be inapplicable; but it is to be remembered that although the cases are not so numerous as elsewhere, the danger in each case of allowing the patient to remain in his own residence, and the consequent necessity of removal, are as great. The subject is now receiving the earnest consideration, both of the Guardians of the Poor, and of the Sanitary Committee of Paddington. Should it unfortunately happen that precautionary measures which have already been taken should fail in arresting the future progress of Small Pox among the poor, it may be confidently anticipated that the great practical difficulties which lie in the way of providing temporary accommodation for the sufferers will be overcome.
