HAMP 4 1897. REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION OF THE Parish of St. John, Hampstead, FOR THE YEAR 1896. BY EDMUND GWYNN, M.D., Medical Officer of Health, REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of health. Vestry Hall, Hampstead, N.W. 10th June, 1897. To the Vestry of the Parish of St. John, Hampstead. Gentlemen, I have the honour to lay before you my Annual Report upon the vital statistics of the Parish of Hampstead for the registration year 1896. For the purposes of this report it is necessary, by the directions of the Local Government Board, to estimate our population to the middle of 1896, which may be taken to be, at that period, 76,216. During 1896, 315 new houses came into occupation, the majority of which were situated in the Kilburn and West End Wards. Marriages.—The number of marriages celebrated was 526, showing an increase of 16 on the previous year. Births.—The births registered during 1896 were 1,462, an increase of 9 on the previous year. The birth-rate was equal to 19.1, or rather less than that for the preceding year, which was 19.8. The birth-rate for London was 30.2, one of the lowest on record. The natural increment of our population by excess of births over deaths was 546. Deaths.—The deaths registered in the year 1896 numbered 1,308. Of this total 472 were deaths within the district of non-parishioners who died in various hospitals and institutions. The number of parishioners who died in Hampstead during 1896 was 836, and to these we must add the deaths of 80 parishioners who died in institutions outside our parish, making a grand total of 916. 4 The annual death-rate will be equal to a ratio of 12, being lower than that for the preceding year, which was equal to 13.4, and also being the lowest recorded death-rate for the year of any parish in the Metropolis. The death-rate for London corresponds to a rate of 18.6 per 1000 of the population, the average death-rate in the previous ten years having been 20.1. With the exception of the rates in the years 1889 and 1894, the rate of 1896 was the lowest hitherto recorded for the Metropolis. Mortality at different Ages.—The deaths of children under one year were 180, or equal to 19.7 per cent. on total deaths, and to 12 per cent. on total births. Between the ages of 1 year and 5 the deaths were 123. At 65 years and upwards there were 238 deaths, and of these 135 died between 65 and 75, 85 between 75 and 85, and 18 between 85 and 95. Seven persons attained to 90 years and upwards, the oldest on the list reaching 95. Deaths in Public Institutions. North-Western Hospital 362 Hampstead Hospital 17 North London Hospital for Consumption 25 St. Peter's Home 13 Friedenheim 80 Workhouse 51 548 With reference to deaths in Public Institutions, the RegistrarGeneral remarks that in London about one in every seven deaths occurred in a Workhouse, one in 45 in a Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospital, one in 10 in some other Hospital, and one in 50 in a Public Lunatic or Imbecile Asylum. Special Causes of Death.—The deaths of parishioners from the seven principal zymotic diseases, after correction for those of our parishioners who died in hospitals outside our district, are equal to a ratio of 1.8. The ratio for London was 3.14. 5 Small Pox.—It is satisfactory to be able to report that no case of small pox was registered in the year. In London 9 deaths were registered from this cause, against 206, 89, and 55 respectively in the three preceding years. The Registrar-General states that no death of a vaccinated person is known to have occurred in 1896. A conference on the Vaccination Acts was held at the Vestry Hall, St. Pancras, which was attended by the Chairman of the Public Health Committee and your Medical Officer. It was stated that, in consequence of the unsatisfactory and often inadequate enforcement of the Vaccination Act by the Metropolitan Boards of Guardians, the number of unvaccinated children in the Metropolis was continually and progressively increasing, in some districts amounting to from 12 to 17 per cent. on the total births, thus making an accumulation of 120,000 unvaccinated children in London in 10 years. It was resolved by the delegates "that the Vaccination Acts should be administered by the Authorities that administer the Acts and provisions for the prevention of the spread of infectious diseases," &c., &c. The long-looked-for Report of the Royal Commission on Vaccination was issued in the Autumn of 1896. The Commission had been sitting for 7 years and held 136 sittings; they examined 187 witnesses and personally investigated 6 epidemics of small pox. The Commissioners, in their report to the nation, say:— "It is to be hoped that our report will stimulate belief in the efficacy of vaccination, that it will remove some misapprehensions and re-assure some who take an exaggerated view of the risks concerned in the operation, as well as lead to a more ready enforcement of the law by local authorities." From this view two of the Commissioners differ, and prefer to rely upon sanitation as a more protective means against small pox. But the great decrease in small pox, when viewed over sufficiently long periods of time, does not, according to the Commissioners, find its explanation in sanitation; on the other hand, it was distinctly and essentially brought about by vaccination. Re-vaccination is strongly recommended; they say "we are fully alive to the protective value of general re-vaccination," and add that "it should be in every 6 way encouraged," and "we think steps should be taken to impress on parents the importance of having their children re-vaccinated not later than at the age of 12 years." Public vaccinators should be allowed to offer calf lymph as a substitute for human lymph in all cases in which it may be preferred. The discontinuance of the enforcement of repeated penalties for non-vaccination is advocated. The extension of the present age limit from three to six months, and the requirement of the vaccination of all children who may be received into any school or institution, and the requirement of re-vaccination of all children at any school or institution on their attaining the age of twelve years, might with advantage be embodied in any legislation which may be enacted by Parliament for the purpose of amending the Vaccination Laws. Scarlet Fever.—Two hundred and ninety-one cases of this disease were registered, against 308 for the previous year, and of these 172 were removed to hospitals. The fatal cases were seven, or one less than for the preceding year. The cases appear to have been mostly of a mild type, for the mortality reached only 2.4 per cent. Diphtheria.—The total number of cases notified was 189, against 112 for 1895, 96 for 1894, and 158 for 1893. The deaths registered from this cause numbered 29, an increase of 16 on the previous year, and equal to a mortality of 15 per cent. on registered cases. The London death-rate from diphtheria in 1893 considerably exceeded the average rate in the ten years, 1886-1895. The death-rate from diphtheria per 1000 living is stated by the Registrar-General in his report to be, for the year under notice, for the Metropolis 0.59, whilst that for Hampstead was 0.39. The number of cases of diphtheria sent into Hospitals from Hampstead was 73. Owing to insufficient hospital accommodation some delay was experienced during the summer months in securing the early removal of cases; but it must be remembered that since the passing of the Notification of Diseases Act, and the removal of restrictions which prevented any person who did not wish to be classed as a pauper from being an inmate of any of the Board's hospitals, the work of making provision for patients has been enormously increased. 7 Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria were more prevalent than in 1895; the Board treated in their Hospitals 15,064 cases of scarlet fever and 4,889 of diphtheria. The Brook Hospital at Shooter's Hill was opened for the reception of patients on August 31st. It provides accommodation for 500 fever and diphtheria patients, and brings up the provision made by the Asylums Board to about, in the aggregate, 5000 beds. The Report of the Medical Superintendents to the Board on the use of antitoxin in the treatment of diphtheria during 1896 confirms the favorable conclusions reached in the previous year. The per-centage of deaths to cases, which was 29.5 in 1894, has fallen to 20.8 during 1896. The report draws attention to the importance of early treatment, which experience shows to be the chief point, and adds that, in the opinion of those signing the report, "we possess in antitoxin serum a remedy of greater value in the treatment of diphtheria than any other with which we are acquainted." Measles occasioned 58 deaths, and proved to be the most fatal cause of death among the zymotic class. No less than 3,697 deaths were certified from measles in London during 1896, and the disease appears to have been more fatal than in any year on record, with the single exception of 1864. The epidemic commenced in this parish towards the end of 1895, and attacked large numbers of young children in the Netherwood Board School, spreading from that centre to the children's homes in the adjacent streets. The children who died were nearly all under five years of age, and many under two years, the parents of whom were almost exclusively confined to the ranks of the working and artizan classes. The question as to the desirability of adding measles to the list of infectious diseases notifiable under the provisions of the Act, has been considered by the Public Health Committee more than once. Having regard to the general susceptibility to measles, the young ages at which the children are attacked, and the highly infectious pre-eruptive stage, when it is difficult to distinguish the complaint from an ordinary catarrh, it did not appear that the advantages to be gained were adequate, or that public opinion was ripe for the measure. With 8 notification must go hospital isolation, and it is probable that, if measles is to be provided for by the Asylums Board, the present accommodation of beds would have to be doubled. Whooping Cough caused 22 deaths, which occurred mostly in the winter and spring quarters, and were due to complications of pneumonia and bronchitis. Enteric Fever.—Fifty-five cases of this disease were notified, of which 7 proved fatal, against 9 fatal cases for the preceding year. Diarrhœa caused 17 deaths, a number below our average. This disease was in excess in London, but the total number of deaths from this cause was not so high as in 1895. Influenza was the registered cause of 9 deaths, and was less fatal than in any year since 1890, when the epidemic began in London. Erysipelas.—Fifty-one cases of erysipelas were registered, and one death was attributed to this cause. Notification of Infectious Diseases.—The total number of certificates received was 599, for notifying which the sum of £69 14s. 6d. was paid to medical practitioners. This amount is recouped to the Vestry by the Asylums Board out of the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund. The total number of cases removed to fever hospitals for treatment was 256. In accordance with the requirements of the Local Government Board, under the Public Health Act, Tables No. I. and No. II. have been prepared. The first of these sets forth the population, births, and number of new cases of infectious disease which have come to my knowledge during the year 1896, and also the number of cases removed from their homes for treatment in isolation hospitals. No. II. shows the deaths which have been registered in the Parish, including also the deaths of parishioners in hospitals and other sanitary institutions outside the sanitary district, classified according to diseases, ages, and localities. 9 Local Diseases.—Diseases of the respiratory organs caused 109 deaths, of which 68 were due to bronchitis, 35 to pneumonia, 4 to pleurisy, and 2 to laryngitis. Diseases of the nervous system caused 77 deaths, including 33 from apoplexy, 13 from inflammation of the brain and its membranes, 13 from convulsions, 2 from epilepsy, and 1 from insanity. Eighty-three persons died from diseases of the heart, 52 from diseases of the digestive organs, including 9 from obstructive diseases of the bowels, 9 from peritonitis, and 17 from diseases of the liver, together with those caused by habits of intemperance. The deaths from diseases of the urinary system were 29, of which 22 were due to nephritis and Bright's disease. The deaths from the accidents and diseases of child birth were 9, 4 of which were referred to puerperal fever. Developmental Diseases include 21 deaths of infants from premature birth, and 4 from congenital malformations. The deaths attributed to senile decay and old age were 40. Constitutional Diseases.—The greatest number of deaths are contained in this class, which includes 45 from cancer, or 5 less than for the preceding year; 23 from tubercular meningitis, hydrocephalus, and tabes mesenterica; 4 from gout and rheumatism, 9 from diabetes (the deaths attributed to this complaint are becoming more numerous year by year), and no less than 86 parishioners perished from consumption and other scrofulous diseases. Consumption is now known to be caused by the tubercle bacillus first discovered by Koch in 1882. This bacillus is freely given off and discharged iu the sputa of consumptive people. It has been shown that this sputa, when dried, may remain infective for long periods, and become a danger to those who inherit a constitution predisposed to consumption. The greatest care therefore should be exercised by those in charge of consumptive patients to prevent the sputa of such becoming dry and infecting the air breathed by others. A spittoon should be used containing a little water, to which a little carbolic acid should be added, and the contents be emptied down the closet. The practice of receiving the sputa on a handkerchief and putting the same 10 under a pillow or in the pocket is dangerous. Hag or paper, which can at once be burnt, may be used for this purpose, and people suffering from consumption should be careful not to spit on the pavement or in public conveyances, such as omnibuses or railway carriages. A predisposition to consumption can be acquired by living in damp and dark rooms, by over-crowding, and by habits of intemperance. The best protection against this disease is the cultivation of good health by means of plenty of exercise in the fresh air and sunshine. Work of the Sanitary Department.—Throughout the Parish 2,856 houses and premises were inspected, and 4,414 re-inspections were made after order or notice had been served. Orders were made for the cleansing, whitewashing, and repairs of 1362 houses, house drains were repaired, reconstructed or new provided in 560 instances, 187 new closets were ordered to be provided, and 365 repaired, cleansed, and ventilated. The paving of 125 house yards required to be repaired or new provided; 49 new dustbins were ordered, and 54 to be repaired; 180 cisterns required to be cleansed, repaired, or covered, and 32 new cisterns provided; three orders were made to provide suitable receptacles for manure, and 155 for removal of dung and other accumulations. Overcrowding was abated in five instances, and five orders were made for the removal of animals improperly kept. The total number of complaints received during the year was 222, a decrease of 36 on the previous year. The number of applications to examine the drainage of private houses was 165. Many of these houses are of considerable size, and demand a great deal of the Inspectors' attention; and I may add that the occupants are becoming more and more exacting, owing to the increased knowledge acquired by the public upon all sanitary questions. The total number of orders made for sanitary amendments was 1,150, and it was necessary to take legal proceedings in 18 instances. The number of houses registered under the Public Health (London) Act now stands at 840. These houses are regularly inspected and orders made for cleansing when necessary. But there are also many premises in the parish, especially in the Kilburn and West End Wards, 11 regarded as private dwellings, which might fairly be classed as tenement houses, seeing that they contain more than one family. To meet the continued and rapid growth of the parish, especially in the Kilburn and West End Wards, I advised the appointment of an additional Inspector for this district. Accordingly your Vestry appointed Mr. Frederick H. Hudson on March 18th, 1897, and to him has been allocated the West End Ward. We have now been enabled to divide the parish into four districts, to each of which a divisional inspector is allotted, so that, for the future, we ought to have no difficulty in carrying out a systematic and periodical inspection of all the Wards. The Cowshed and Slaughter-houses were inspected by the Public Health Committee on October 5th. No objection was raised to the renewal of the various licences. Bakehouses.—These now number 39, and are regularly inspected. Beyond orders for cleansing and white-washing being occasionally necessary, it may be said that the sanitary condition of these premises is satisfactory. Inquests.—The number of inquests held was 69, that being an increase of 17 on the previous year, and 37 of these were deaths caused by violence. There were five deaths from fractures and contusions caused by falls and being run over, four from burns and scalds, and six infants perished from suffocation in bed or neglect at birth. A cook, aged 55, and housemaid, aged 15, were poisoned by an escape of coal gas from a burner, the tap of which had not been properly turned off. A male, aged 36, died from electric shock. There were seven cases of suicide, three of these caused death by drowning, one by poisoning by oxalic acid, one by wound in throat, and two by fracture of the skull from bullet wounds. Mortuary.—The total number of bodies received during the year was 71, and of these 47 were admitted by order of the Coroner; 47 post mortem examinations were made; 16 bodies were brought in by the police, 4 by order of medical men, and 4 by the request of friends. 12 Disinfection.—The number of houses disinfected after infectious disease was 187. The total number of articles disinfected reached 9,561, a slight iucrease on the number for the previous year. Complaints of sewer emanations were less numerous than hitherto, and have all received the careful attention of the Public Health Committee and staff. Points frequently complained of were those in the vicinity of the sewer ventilators situated in Nassington and Parliament Hill Roads A Sub-Committee visited the Strand District to observe the effect of a Deakins' Sewer Gas Extractor and Destructor placed at the dead end of a sewer. It was stated that complaints of offensive emanations had ceased since the destructor had been started, and that the householders closely adjoining the lamp had not experienced any inconvenience from the proximity of the lamp to the windows. Your Committee resolved to defer the consideration of the subject for three months, for the purpose of obtaining further information thereon. Water Supply.—Hampstead is supplied by water for domestic purposes by the New River and West Middlesex Companies. The water of the New River Company has throughout the year contained less organic matter than that of the West Middlesex, the average proportion in a given quantity being—New River 1.7, West Middlesex 3.2. Professor Frank land states that the Thames was, owing to floods in March, October, and December, somewhat less pure than that delivered for 1895; but that the New River water was not affected by that cause. The average daily consumption is estimated to be 28 gallons per person for all purposes. With respect to the presence of organic matter in water, either of vegetable or animal origin, Professor Frank land states that it is gratifying to find that the zymotic matters of the pathogenic kind are rapidly destroyed in running water, and "that it is now an established fact that efficient sand filtration would prevent the passage of such germs into the filtered water, even should they arrive in a living condition at the intakes of the companies." This result of recent observations "is confirmed by the absence in London since the year 1866 of zymotic disease traceable to the water supply." 13 Of late years the bacterioscopic examination of water used for dietetic purposes has been much employed. It is pointed out that it must not be assumed that if these waters contain many microbes they are necessarily unwholesome; or, at least, to be regarded with suspicion, for there is no evidence whatever that ordinary river microbes cause injury to health. The standard taken by the professor is that of 100 microbes per cubic centimetre as an indication of efficient filtration. The microbe determination of the West Middlesex Company, after filtration, is stated to have been 99.79, and that of the New River Company 99.07. The attention of householders should be directed to the periodical cleansing of cisterns and to the providing of well-fitting covers to exclude light and dirt. The work of the Sanitary Department continues to expand with the growth of the Parish and the increase in legislation dealing with sanitary subjects. The numerous and important duties devolving upon the Chief Inspector and the Divisional Inspectors have been carried out with activity and success. I have to thank the various officers of the Vestry for the necessary information which I have received from them, as well as to acknowledge the assistance and support I have derived from the Public Health Committee and its Chairman in successfully carrying out the duties of the office. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, EDMUND GWYNN, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. Table No. I.
