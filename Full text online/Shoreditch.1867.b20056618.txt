Report of the Chief Sanitary Inspector. Gentlemen, I beg to submit for your information the following summary of Sanitary Works, carried out under the inspection, and by the orders of your Inspectors during the year ending March, 1868. About 2000 houses have been inspected as the house to house visitations. 110 houses visited where infectious disorders were raging. 77 Cesspools have been abolished. 50 proper Water Closets have been erected, all provided with proper trapped soil pans, and properly drained to the Sewers. 201 House Drains have been properly cleansed. 309 Houses have been properly cleansed throughout. 663 Yards have been re-paved to improve the surface drainage. 391 Walls of Yards have been limewhitcd. 557 Drains in Yards have been trapped. 22 Houses have been ventilated by having additional windows or skylights where ventilation was defective. 25 Courts have been cleansed, and the walls limewhited. 400 New Dust-bins have been provided. 29 cases of insufficient water supply. 20 Dung-pits have been constructed. 36 New Water Butts, and 8 new Cisterns have been provided, and 30 Water Butts have been re-pitched. 15 instances of keeping pigs where notices have been served to remove them. In six cases meat and fish have been destroyed, being unfit for human food. I have also visited, each week since October, the following Police Stations, to take the register of the public lamps of the parish damaged 22 or not lighted during the night, viz.:— N Division,—Hackney, Newington, and Kingsland Road. G Division,—Old Street. H Division,—Spital Square. There have been 64 lamps out all night, and 23 broken. There are 78 Slaughter-houses, 47 Cow-houses, and 147 Bake-houses. I visit the whole of the Slaughter and Cow Houses four times a year, and the Bakers half-yearly. I have also visited houses and shops where Fireworks are sold, &c.
