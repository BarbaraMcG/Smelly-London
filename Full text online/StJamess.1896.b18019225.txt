IN accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, the Vestry present the following Report of their proceedings and an abstract of their accounts for the twelve months ended the 25th March last; also a statement of Contracts entered into or in force during that time, and the liabilities of the Vestry at the end thereof, together with the Report of their Surveyor for the same period, and of their Medical Officer of Health for the year 1896. Having regard to the fact that the Minutes of the Vestry are now printed, containing a full and comprehensive record of the proceedings of the Vestry, and a copy forwarded to each member of the Board, and bearing in mind that so few copies of the Annual Report of the Vestry are from time to time applied for by the Parishioners, it has been deemed advisable to somewhat curtail the subjects dealt with in this Report, dealing simply, in as short and concise a manner as possible, with such questions as may be presumed to be of general interest. b 2 20 The Vestry include in their Report, for the information of the Ratepayers, the Report and Accounts of the Public Baths and Wash-houses Committee, and append Statements of Accounts relating to the Guardians of the Westminster Union, and the Trustees of Charitable Endowments in which the parish is interested. THE PARISH. Extent.—The parish occupies an area of 162 acres. It has about 12½ miles of streets, of which 3¼ miles are paved with wood, 5¾ with asphalte, ¾ with pitching, with macadam, and 1½ miles consist of courts, yards and passages. Population.—The resident population, according to the census taken in March, 1896, under the Equalisation of Rates, is shown by the Registrar-General's Weekly Return for the week ending May 23rd, to be 23,050. This number is 1,94-5 less than that shown by the Census of 1891, and there appears to be little doubt that the resident population of the Parish will continue to decrease owing to the gradual conversion of dwelling-houses into warehouses and offices for business purposes only. Local Government.—The Parish has a separate jurisdiction under the Metropolis Local Management Act, and particulars of the powers of the Vestry elected pursuant to that Act are given on pages 24-26. For Poor Law purposes the Parish is joined to the Parish of St. Anne, under the name of the Westminster Union; it is also a constituent part of the Central London Sick Asylum District. Wards.—The Parish has been divided into four Wards for the Election of Vestrymen, and this division is followed 21 in the preparation of the Lists of Voters for Members of Parliament, the County Council, School Board and Vestry Elections. The name of the Ward is printed on the rate receipt of each ratepayer. For Ecclesiastical Purposes the Parish has been sub-divided into five districts, the mother church being St. James's, Piccadilly, of which the Right Rev. Bishop Barry is Rector. Representation in Parliament. — The Parish of St. James was formerly comprised in the Parliamentary Borough of the City of Westminster, which returned two Members to Parliament; it now, however, forms a part of the Borough of Strand, which returns one member, the present representative being the Hon. W. F. D. Smith. The Register prepared in 1896 contains the" names of 3,875 Pai'liamentary Electors, viz., 196 Lodgers, and 3,679 possessing other qualifications. There are also 637 County and Parochial Electors who have been placed on the Register under the Local Government Acts, 1888 and 1894, but are not qualified to vote for Members of Parliament. Parliamentary voters for the County of Middlesex, in respect of property situate wholly or in part in the Parish of St. James, number 199. By the Elementary Education Act, 1870, the Parish is included in the Westminster Division of. the School Board for London. Five members of the School Board are elected by the ratepayers of the Division, the present members being General Sim*, Mr. David Laing, Mr. William Winnett, J. P., Rev. A. W. Oxford and Captain Skinner. * Recently deceased. 22 Water Supply.—Four Companies supply the Parish with water, the approximate boundaries of their respective districts being as follows:— 1. Chelsea Waterworks Company (Chief Office, 35, Commercial Road, Pimlico). So much of the Parish as lies to the south of the centre of Pall Mall and Cleveland Row. This Company was incorporated by Royal Charter in the year 1722. • 2. New River Company (Chief Office, Clerkenwell, E.C.). So much of the Parish as lies to the east of a line running at the back of the east side of Poland Street, Lexington Street, Great Windmill Street, and along the centre of the Haymarket. This Company was incorporated by Royal Charter in the year 1619. 3. Grand Junction Waterworks Company (Chief Office, 65, South Molton Street). So much of the Parish as lies to the west of the district supplied by the New River Company and the north of the centre of Pall Mall. This Company was incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1811. 4. West Middlesex Waterworks Company (Chief Office, 19, Marylebone Road). So much of Oxford Street as is situate within the Parish. This Company was incorporated by Act of Parliament in the year 1806. The rates of charge for a supply of water for domestic purposes authorised by the various Acts of Parliament relating to the several above-mentioned Companies are almost identical, the scale being as follows :— Where the annual value of the dwelling-house or other place does not exceed £200, a rate not exceeding 4 per cent. per annum; where such annual value exceeds £200, a rate not exceeding 3 per cent. per annum. An additional charge, 23 varying from 4s. per annum where the annual value of the house exceeds £30, but is less than £50, to 12s. where the annual value of the house exceeds £300, is permitted for each single water closet, fixed bath, or high service; for each additional water closet, fixed bath, or high service half these rates are to be charged. High service is defined as a delivery of water at an elevation of more than ten feet above the pavement in front of the dwelling-house or other place supplied. The Companies may supply water for other than domestic purposes, either upon agreed terms or by meter at a specified rate. Gas is supplied to the whole Parish by the Gas Light and Coke Company (Chief Office, Horseferry Road). Electricity, both for purposes of light and power, is supplied by the London Electric Supply Corporation and the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company. Each of these Companies has parliamentary power to supply in any part of the Parish, and is under compulsion to supply any parishioner upon certain specified conditions. The former Company supply an alternating current, with the use of converters or transformers, the latter supply a direct continuous current. The offices of the London Company are at 25a, Cockspur Street, S.W., and those of the St. James's Company at Carnaby Street. The Testing Station for Electric Light Meters is at 42, Cranbourne Street, W.C. The Coroner is Mr. John Troutbeck, whose jurisdiction extends throughout the City and Liberties of Westminster. 24 For the Registration of Births and Deaths the Parish is included in the Westminster District. The SubRegistrar is Mr. Thomas Matthew Crowe, of 31, Wardour Street; and the Superintending Registrar, Mr. Joseph Bond, Union Offices, Poland Street. THE VESTRY, as now constituted under the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and the Local Government Act, 1894, consists of 48 elected and three ex-officio members, the latter being the Rector and Churchwardens. It superseded a Vestry elected under the provisions of a permissive statute, 1 and 2 William IV., cap. 60, which was adopted by the ratepayers of St. James's on the 6th April, 1832. This elected Vestry had in its turn superseded a select Vestry established by the Act under which the Parish was created in 1685. The select Vestry was virtually a self-appointed body, vacancies being filled up by the surviving members. Neither the ancient select Vestry nor the Vestry elected under the statute of 1831 had any jurisdiction over the paving or drainage of the parish. Each of these matters was under the control of a separate and distinct body of Commissioners. The Act of 1855 transferred to the Vestry as now constituted, not only all the powers of the earlier Vestry, but also those relating to paving, drainage, and lighting formerly exercised by these Commissioners. Subsequent legislation has laid upon the Vestry various additional duties, and in many respects, the powers of the Vestry within the area of its jurisdiction resemble those of the Town Council of a corporate town, with the addition of rating powers, although as regards the police force, the provision of markets, and the supply of gas and water, not this parish alone, but the metropolis at large, stands on a 25 different footing from provincial towns of comparatively minor importance. The following pages will show the diversity of subjects coming within the purview of the Vestry, but it may be convenient here to enumerate the more important functions of that body, viz.:— 1. Paving, cleansing, watering, and lighting the public streets. 2. Constructing, maintaining, and cleansing local sewers, public conveniences, &c. 3. Supervising the construction, alteration, and amendment of the drains and sanitary arrangements of dwelling- houses and other buildings. 4. Preventing, removing, and abating nuisances injurious to health, disinfecting after sickness, &c. 5. Regulating projections into the public streets, and annoyances of various kinds. 6. Preserving, as far as possible, freedom from adulteration in articles of food and medicine. 7. Levying and collecting the rates, from which large, and unfortunately rapidly increasing, sums are paid annually to authorities entirely independent of local control. Upon the last-mentioned point it may be here observed that there has been a growing tendency for some years to include in the local rates various sums for Metropolitan purposes. Thus since the year 1855 the Vestry have at different times been required by Parliament to provide funds for—(a) Main Drainage; (b) Fire Brigade; (c) Elementary Education; (d) Thames Bridges—purchase' 26 maintenance, and re-building; (e) Artizans' Dwellings; (f) Equalisation of Rates; and other purposes. The extent to which this operates upon local rates will be seen on reference to the statement of moneys raised with the parochial rates for Metropolitan purposes, which is given on page 64. PERSONAL. Early in the year the Vestry and the Parish lost the services, through death, of Mr. Ephraim Tysall, for many years a Vestryman and Guardian for Great Marlborough Ward. Mr. Tysall was one of the most respected and esteemed members of the Vestry, and his loss caused sincere regret. A letter was addressed, by direction of the Vestry, to the family of the late Mr. Tysall, conveying the Vestry's sincere condolence with them in their bereavement, and their regret at the loss of so esteemed and able a colleague. Two members of the Vestry, viz., Mr. Harry Dawes, Golden Square Ward, and Mr. A. L. Liberty, J.P., Great Marlborough Ward, became disqualified from serving the office of Vestryman during the year. Mr. T. Wall, Pall Mall Ward, who had been absent from meetings of the Vestry for more than six months, expressed a desire, in consequence of the state of his health and other engagements, to be relieved of the office, and the Vestry accordingly, in pursuance of the Local Government Act, 1894, Section 46, Sub-section 7, declared the office of Vestryman, held by Mr. Wall, to be vacant. These vacancies were accordingly tilled up by casual elections as mentioned on page 28. 27 ELECTION OF CHAIRMAN OF VESTRY. As required by the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1894, the Vestry at their first meeting after the election in May, 1896, proceeded to elect a Chairman, when Mr. William Winnett, of 73, Wardour Street, was unanimously re-elected Chairman of the Vestry until the next election of Vestrymen in May, 1897. ELECTION OF VESTRYMEN AND AUDITORS. The annual election of Vestrymen and Auditors in this Parish was held on Monday, the 18th May, the day fixed by the Vestry. The Local Government Board, in their General Order of the 24th March, 1896, relating to the nomination and election of Vestrymen in that year, fixed Monday, the 18th May, 1896, or such other day not earlier than the l6th May, or later than the 20th May, as might be fixed by the London County Council. The Vestry ventured to question the power of the Local Government Board to either fix the day of poll themselves or authorise the County Council to do so, as they believed that the right of appointing the day of election in the month of May was still reserved to them under section 7 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, which had never been repealed. The opinion was accordingly taken of Mr. Alexander McMorran, Q.C., who endorsed the Vestry's view that the Local Government Board had not power to fix the date of election or to enable the County Council to do so. The Election in St. James's therefore was fixed by the Vestry for Monday, the 18th May, and the poll was taken on that date in lieu of Saturday, the 16th May, the date fixed by the County Council. Much more activity than usual was displayed at this election, particularly in the Golden Square and Great Marlborough Wards of the Parish where several new members were elected for the first time on the Vestry. 28 CASUAL ELECTIONS OF VESTRYMEN. Three casual elections were held during the year, viz.:— one in Pall Mall Ward, to fill the vacancies caused by the retirement of Mr. Wall, and the election of Mr. F. Walker, of 230, Regent Street, for both Pall Mall and Great Marlborough Wards, Mr. Walker having elected to serve for Great Marlborough Ward; one in Golden Square Ward, to fill the vacancy caused by the retirement of Mr. Dawes; and one in Great Marlborough Ward to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Mr. Tysall. Capt. George Henry Brougham Glasier, of 7, St. James's Street, was elected in place of Mr. Wall, for the period ending May, 1898; Mr. Benjamin Frederick Hawkins, of 108, Jermyn Street, in place of Mr. Walker, for the period ending May, 1899; Mr. William Hill Watson, of 7, Denman Street, in place of Mr. Dawes, for the period ending May, 1897; and Mr. William Polatchek Frohlich, of 10, Sackville Street, for the period ending May, 1898, in place of the late Mr. Tysall. VESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. The following is the number of Meetings held during the year:— Vestry Meetings 22 Finance Committee 18 Public Health Committee 18 Parliamentary Bills and General Purposes Committee 20 Works Committee 23 St. James's Dwellings Committee 13 Valuation Committee 7 Special and Sub-Committees 7 Public Baths and Washhouses Committee 19 Total 147 29 The ordinary meetings of the Vestry are held on the first and third Thursdays in each month, at 11 a.m., but a special meeting may be convened at any time upon the requisition of nine members and some of the ordinary meetings are suspended at vacation times. Six Standing Committees are appointed annually, in accordance with the Bye -laws of the Vestry, and meet on certain specified days. A Committee is at the same time appointed for the management of the property vested in the Vestry known as "St. James's Dwellings," Silver Place, and No. 7, Ingestre Place, who also have control of the Parish freehold property in Marshall Street. Special Committees are appointed from time to time to consider subjects not coming within the ordinary duties of either of the Standing Committees. A list of the present Committees will be found on pages 9 & 10. OFFICERS OF THE VESTRY. Vestry Clerk's Department.—At the commencement of the year the salary of Mr. T. J. Chettleburgh, First Assistant Clerk, was increased from £180 to £200 per annum; that of Mr. J. Born, Junior Accounts Clerk, from £50 to £60; that of Mr. T. S. Robertson, Junior Clerk, from £26 to £40; and that of G. Beggerstaff, Junior Messenger, from 13s. to 17s. weekly. In April, 1896, Mr. F. E. Lampard resigned his appointment as Third Assistant Clerk, on obtaining the position of Minuting, Correspondence and Shorthand Clerk to the Hackney Vestry, and Mr. T. K. Reid was appointed to till the vacancy, at a commencing salary of £80 per annum, rising by annual increments of £10 to £120. Works Department.—Mr. H. C. Oliver has been appointed Sanitary and Surveyor's Clerk, at a commencing salary of £80 per annum, rising by annual increments of 30 £5 to £100, in succession to Mr. T. H. Hooper who resigned the position on obtaining a Sanitary Inspectorship under the Lambeth Vestry. Special Committee.—The Special Committee, to which reference was made in the last Annual Report as having been appointed to enquire into the duties of all officers of the Vestry, and as to the desirability or otherwise of steps being taken to prevent a Sanitary Inspector or other officer holding house property in the Parish in which he acts, or acting as a Collector of Rents or Agent in respect of other property in such Parish, submitted their report to the Vestry in July last. The Committee, in the first instance, stated that they did not understand the reference to mean a general inquiry into the duties of every member of the staff, say with a view to re-arrangement, but simply an enquiry into such duties the efficient discharge of which might possibly be incompatible with the owning or holding of house property in the same district as that in which the officer acts. On these lines the Committee reported that two officers, viz Mr. W. H. Watson, the Chief Sanitary Inspector, and Mr. J. Flint, the Caretaker of St. James's Dwellings, owned or were interested in tenement house property in the district, and expressed the opinion that it was incompatible with the satisfactory and efficient discharge of the duties of the holders of these offices that they should be interested in tenement property in the Parish. The Vestry, after consideration, adopted the Committee's report and decided to determine the engagement of the Sanitary Inspectors and Caretaker of St. James's Dwellings, with a view of making new engagements with any officers who could comply with the Vestry's requirements. Accordingly, the two Inspectors and the Caretaker of St. James's Dwellings 31 were given notice to terminate their engagements, and Mr. Folland, Sanitary Inspector, was the only one reappointed. Public Health Department.—In considering the action necessary to be taken on the above resolution the Vestry decided that the Medical Officer of Health and Sanitary Inspectors should in future be appointed under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, whereby the appointments are subject to the approval of the Local Government Board and one-half of the remuneration of such officers is paid by the London County Council. Accordingly Dr. Edmunds, Medical Officer of Health, and Mr. J. P. Folland, Sanitary Inspector, who were originally appointed under the Metropolis Local Management Acts and the old Nuisances Removal Act, were reappointed under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, at the same remuneration as they were then receiving, subject to each of the officers giving an undertaking not to own or be interested in any house property in the Parish, or act as Collector of Rents or Agent in respect of any other property in the Parish. The vacancy created by Mr. Watson leaving the Vestry's service was filled up, with the approval of the Local Government Board, by the appointment of Mr. T. W. Calverley at a commencing salary of £120, rising by annual increments of £5 to £l50, with uniform, on condition that he lives in the Parish, and subject to the condition relating to house property mentioned above. St. James's Dwellings.—Mr. C. Slader, and his wife, have been appointed Caretakers of St. James's Dwellings, in place of Mr. J. Flint and wife, at wages of 23s. per week (with rooms and gas free), subject to the conditions relating to house property before mentioned. 32 STANDING ORDERS.

That no sweeper, artisan, or labourer so discharged shall be taken again into the Vestry's employ without the express sanction of the Works Committee or the Vestry. (W., 16, p. 97.) 24th September, 1896.—That it be an instruction to the Rate Collectors not to accept any post-dated cheques for rates in future.

In accordance with the local Act of Parliament, the Vestry on the 9th day of April, 1896, nominated eight parishioners to serve the office of Overseers of the Poor. The names of these gentlemen were submitted to the Justices of the Peace, at a Petty Sessions held at the Vestry Hall, when the following were appointed Overseers for the year 1896-7:— Mr. James Pearce, 20 Crown Court. Mr. William Hill, 189, Piccadilly. Mr. Leonard Elston Macqueen, 35, Great Pulteney Street. Mr. George Angold, 14, Broad Street. APPLICATION FOR ORDER FOR APPOINTING OVERSEERS AND CERTAIN POWERS POSSESSED BY PARISH COUNCILS. The attention of the Vestry having been called to the desirability of applying to the Local Government Board for an Order under Section 33 of the Local Government Act, 1894, conferring upon the Vestry the power of appointing Overseers and certain powers possessed by Parish Councils, the Vestry Clerk submitted a report on the subject as follows:— REPORT by Vestry Clerk on the reference by the Vestry of the 1st October, 1896, to the Parliamentary Bills Committee to consider and report as to the desirability of applying to the Local Government Board for an Order under Section 33 of the Local Government Act, 1894, conferring upon 37 the Vestry the power of appointing Overseers, and certain powers possessed by Parish Councils. There are really two distinct questions involved in the abovementioned reference, which it would be desirable to deal with separately; that is to say (a) As to the desirability of obtaining an order for power to appoint Overseers, and (b) as to applying for an order to confer on the Vestry certain powers possessed by Parish Councils. Appointment of Overseers–At present the Overseers of the Poor are appointed under the Local Act of 2 Geo. III., cap. 58. By the first section of that Act the Vestrymen for the time being of the Parish are required to meet together on some day in Easter week, and then and there make a list in writing of the names of eight persons, being substantial householders in the Parish, whom the Vestrymen think are fitly qualified to be nominated and appointed Overseers of the Poor of the Parish. This list has to be delivered to two Justices of the Peace for the Division, who are authorised and required to nominate and appoint any four, whom they shall think proper, of the persons whose names are submitted to them, to be Overseers of the Poor. By section 83 of the Local Government Act, 1894, it is pro. vided that the Local Government Board may, on the application of the Vestry, make an order conferring on the Vestry, inter alia, "the appointment of Overseers and Assistant Overseers." Should the Vestry, therefore, deem it advisable to apply to the Board for an Order under the said section, authorising them to appoint Overseers, and such Order be issued, the present system of making a list of eight persons, and presenting it to the Justices for the selection of four therefrom, would be discontinued, and the Vestry themselves would be empowered to nominate and appoint the four Overseers of the parish without any submission to Justices. Powers possessed by Parish Councils.—The same section (33-1) which empowers the Local Government Board to confer the appointment of Overseers on the Vestry, also enables the Board to issue an Order conferring on the Vestry "any powers, 38 duties or liabilities of Overseers, and any powers, duties or liabilities of a Parish Council." The Board, however, in dealing with applications which have been made to them under this section, have expressed their unwillingness to confer all the powers, duties, and liabilities of Overseers, although they would be prepared to consider an application for such of the powers as are by the Act transferred to Parish Councils. In making application, therefore, to the Board for the transfer of the powers, &c., of Overseers, it would be necessary to limit the application to those powers of Overseers named in section 6 (1) (c) of the Act which become transferred to Parish Councils, and are set out in the said section as follows:— I.—Appeals or objections by them in respect of the Valuation List, or appeals in respect of the Poor Rate, or County Bate, or the basis of the County Bate ; II.—The provision of parish books, and of a vestry room or parochial office, &c.; III.—The holding or management of parish property, not being property relating to affairs of the Church, or held for an ecclesiastical charity. It will be seen that the section (33), before referred to, contemplates the transfer to the London Vestries of "any powers, duties or liabilities of a Parish Council," in addition to those of Overseers. Under section 6 (1) various powers became transferred to the Parish Council on its coming into office, and these powers, having become possessed by Parish Councils, would be transferable to London authorities under section 33 of the Act. In addition to the powers, &c., of Overseers beforementioned, the following powers, duties, and liabilities of a Parish Council appear to be those which under the provisions of the Act could be conferred upon the Vestry should they deem it advisable to apply to the Board to issue an Order for that purpose:— The powers, duties, and liabilities of the Churchwardens of the Parish with respect to maintaining and repairing closed 39 churchyards wherever the expenses of such maintenance and repair are repayable out of the Poor Rate under the Burial Act, 1855. [Sec. 6 (1) (b).] The powers exercisable, with the approval of the Local Government Board, by the Board of Guardians for the Poor Law Union comprising the parish, in respect of the sale, exchange, or letting of any parish property. [Sec. 6 (1) (d).] Power to provide or acquire buildings for public offices and for meetings, and for any purposes connected with parish business, or with the powers or duties of the Vestry [Sec. 8 (1) (a).] Power to provide or acquire land for such buildings, and for a recreation ground and public walks. [Sec. 8 (1) (b).] Power to utilise any well or spring within the parish, and provide facilities for obtaing water therefrom, but so as not to interfere with the rights of any corporation or persons. [Sec. 8 (1) (e).] Power to acquire by agreement any right of way. [Sec. 8 (1) (g).] Power to accept and hold any gifts of property, real or personal, for the benefit of the inhabitants of the parish or any part thereof. [Sec. 8 (1) (h).] Power to execute any works (including works of maintenance or improvement) incidental to or consequential on the exercise of any of the foregoing powers, or in relation to any parish property, not being property relating to affairs of the Church, or held for an ecclesiastical charity. [Sec. 8 (1) (i).] Power to contribute towards the expense of doing any of the things above-mentioned, or to agree or combine with any other parish for that purpose. [Sec. 8 (1) (k).] Powers for compulsorily acquiring land by a prescribed procedure, with the right of petition to the Local Government Board for a local inquiry. [Sec. 9.] Powers of a Parish Council to borrow money for the purposes enumerated in Section 12. 40 Right of consent to the stopping up or diversion of highways and the repair and maintenance of public footpaths under certain conditions. [ Sec. 13.] Power to appoint additional trustees on the governing body of a parochial charity, other than an ecclesiastical charity, where such body does not include any persons elected by the ratepayers, or by a popularly elected body. [Sec. 14 (3) and (5).] Power to use school-rooms and other rooms maintained out of Parliamentary grants or local rates for certain specified purposes free of charge. [Sec. 4.] By Section 5 of the Act the legal interest in all property vested either in the Overseers or in the Churchwardens and Overseers of a rural parish, other than property connected with the affairs of the Church, or held for an ecclesiastical charity, become vested in the Parish Council, subject to all trusts and liabilities affecting the same. I do not find, however, that the Local Government Board have sufficient power under Section 33 to transfer to the Vestry the property vested in the Churchwardens and Overseers (e.g., the Marshall Street houses); although possibly the power of disposing of such property might be conferred upon the Vestry, subject to certain restrictions, as in the case of a Parish Council under Section 6 (1) (d). Should the Vestry resolve to apply for an Order under section 33 for any of the powers which I have mentioned in this report as possessed by a Parish Council, it might perhaps be advisable to include in the application the transfer of the legal interest in the property vested in the Churchwardens and Overseers, in case the Board are advised they have power to transfer such interest. The subject was thoroughly considered by the Vestry, and instructions were given for an application under the Common Seal of the Vestry to be made to the Local Government Board to confer on the Vestry the powers above referred to. The subject had not been determined by the Board at Lady-day. 41 PUBLIC BATHS AND WASH-HOUSES. In April last the Public Baths and Wash-houses Committee submitted their first Report and Statement of Accounts, which was received and approved by the Vestry, as follows:— REPORT of the PUBLIC BATHS and WASH-HOUSES COMMITTEE, For the 15 Months commencing 1st January, 1896, and ending 25th March, 1897. Board Room, Marshall Street, W., April, 1897. In accordance with the Bye-laws of the Vestry, the Public Baths and Wash-houses Committee present the following Report relating to their proceedings and the establishment under their control, together with an Abstract of Accounts for the fifteen months, ended 25th March last. It will probably be in the minds of most Vestrymen that the Baths and Wash-houses were transferred to the Vestry by an order of the Local Government Board, under the Local Government Act, 1894, which came into operation on the 1st January, 1896, and that it devolved upon this Committee to have the care, management, and control of the undertaking. The Committee at their first meeting unanimously elected Mr. Wm. Truman, who has been associated with the Baths for many years, as their Chairman. The Accounts of the Baths have previously been made up to the 31st December in each year; but, with a view of bringing them into conformity with the Accounts of the Vestry, whose financial year ends on the 25th March, this report, and the figures contained therein, extend over a period of fifteen months, from the 1st January, 1896, to the 25th March, 1897. the figures for the year 1896 are, however, given separately to those for the three months ending Lady-day. 42 Return as to Bathers. It is gratifying to note that the number of bathers using the establishment in 1896 was even greater than the previous year, and the following comparative statement, giving details of the various bath tickets issued during the past three years, speaks for itself:— 1894. 1895. 1896. From 1st Jan. to 25th Mar., 1897.

Notwithstanding the fact that £300 is paid to the London County Council each year in repayment of principal of the loan of £3,000, it is satisfactory to note that no precept has been made on the Vestry, or charge on the rates, since January, 1894. It will thus be seen that the profits from the baths have been sufficient, during the past two years, to meet, not only this amount, but also the expenses of management and the cost of executing casual repairs. Renewals and Repairs. The expenditure under the head of Renewals and Repairs, includes certain alterations carried out to the back end plates of No. 4 Boiler, in order to minimise the grooving effect upon the plates internally. New steam pipe has been fitted in connection with the steam engine from Laundry to Boiler House. As a matter of urgency, one of the defective girders, supporting the roof of the Laundry has been removed, and a new principal of improved pattern supplied. Particulars relating to the condition of the girders is mentioned hereafter. Condition of Roof. The attention of the Committee was called, in the latter end of last year, to the defective condition of the girders and roof of the Baths and Wash-houses, and it was referred to a member of the Committee (Mr. Wm. Iredale), the Vestry's Surveyor, and the Engineer of the Baths, to consider the subject. They reported that, having overhauled the roof and made a thorough examination of the girders, it was found that, in the old building erected in 1850, all the girders (with the exception of the new o ie previously referred to) were in a very defective condition, 45 being more or less rusted away; the tie-rods in places being eaten quite half through, and, in several instances out of the perpendicular; and expressed an opinion that all the girders in the old building (with the one exception) should be removed, and replaced with new, and that the remaining girders and roof should bo repaired where necessary. Tenders have therefore been invited for carrying out the work suggested in the report. Additional Dressing Boxes. First-class Swimming Bath. Owing to the inconvenience experienced, during the hot weather, of providing sufficient dressing accommodation in the First-class Swimming Bath, for the large number of bathers, the Committee have had ten additional dressing boxes constructed, of the same design as the existing boxes, at the end of the Swimming Bath, behind the diving boards. The alteration in no way deteriorates, but rather adds to the attractiveness of the Bath. Advertising the Baths. With a view of making the Baths better known in the neighbouring locality, the Committee have had some framed advertisements, containing a coloured view of the Swimming Baths, prepared, and obtained consent to exhibit them in the principal Clubs, Restaurants, Hotels, and other large establishments in the Parish. The Committee also have under consideration the question of further advertising the Baths by means of small enamelled iron tablets being fixed to the railings of the public conveniences, Piccadilly Circus and Great Marlborough Street, and also to certain lamp columns in the district, but no actual decision had been arrived at up to the close of this report. Insurance of Boilers. The Boilers belonging to the Baths are insured with the Vulcan Boiler Insurance and Steam Power Company, and are thoroughly overhauled and inspected periodically by their Inspectors. 46 Rota Committee. A Rota Committee, consisting generally of three members of the Committee, is appointed periodically to inspect the establishment, and report generally upon any matters calling for attention. Staff. In accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1894. the staff of the Baths became transferred to the Vestry, under the Order of the Local Government Board, but several changes have taken place in the period under review. It was with regret that the Committee received the resignation of the Moneytaker, Mr. J. Evans, in the early part of the year. Mr. Evans had held his position since 1874, but for some time past had sufferad from general infirmity and failing health. At his request, the Vestry unanimously passed a resolution, granting him a superannuation of twenty-three sixtieths of his wages, but, unfortunately, owing to the death of Mr. Evans, it has been unnecessary to proceed further in the matter. In filling up the position of Moneytaker, the Committee, with a view of effecting an improvement in the manner of carrying out the duties, and diminishing somewhat the present hours of labour of the female Moneytaker in the Laundry, have appointed two young women, and the work of money taking has been apportioned between the three. Accounts. The following is a Statement of the Accounts for the fifteen months, ending 25th March, 1897, from which it will be seen that the Baths are in a good financial position: — 47 Statement of Receipts and Expenditure.

On the 26th August, 1846, the Royal assent was given to the Act in question, and on the 10th December, in the same year, the Vestry decided to establish Public Baths and Wash-houses in the Parish. Consequently, St. James was one of the first Local Authorities to give the ratepayers the advantages afforded by the legislature. Seven Commissioners having been appointed to carry the Act into execution, some delay occurred in the selection of a suitable site in consequence of the difficulty of obtaining land owing to the whole of the parish being built upon. Ultimately, with the approval of the Vestry, Public Baths and Wash-houses were erected on the site of 16, Marshall Street, the freehold of which belonged to the Parish, and over a portion of the Workhouse stoneyard adjoining. The building was opened to the public in 1852 and proved itself an immediate success. In the course of a few years to meet the increased demand for improved accommodation for bathing, especially for women, the Commissioners decided to extend the building, and in 1860 they obtained the necessary consents to appropriate a further portion of the Parish property in Marshall Street (Nos. 17 & 18). The increased accommodation provided by this extension was generally appreciated, and the number of bathers and washers continued to increase until the maximum was reached in 1865, when 160,480 tickets were issued to bathers and 70,057 to washers, or a total of 230,537 tickets in one year. d 50 In 1890 the Commissioners came to the conclusion that to meet the requirements of the district it was necessary to provide an additional Swimming Bath of modern design, and for this purpose they proposed to utilise, subject to the consent of the Vestry and the Local Government Board, the two houses Nos. 14 and 15, Marshall Street, belonging to the Vestry. The consent of the Vestry was given to the proposal, and the Local Government Foard held the usual public inquiry into the circumstances. Although previous notice of the inquiry had been widely given, only three ratepayers attended to object. After hearing all the evidence tendered, the inspector remarked that he had held many similar inquiries, but did not call to mind one in which it had been so clearly shown that a Bath would impose so small a burden, if any, upon the ratepayers. The Local Government Board subsequently gave their consent, and the Commissioners erected the present handsome Swimming Bath. The cost of erecting the original building in 1851, and furnishing and extending in 1861, was about £21,000, which sum was borrowed on the security of the Poor Rate. The last instalment of the loan in respect of this amount was paid in 1891. The cost incurred in the erection and fitting of the new Swimming Bath amounts to £5,849 13s. 8d., after deducting the amount contributed by the Vestry for the construction of the storage accommodation which has been provided under the Baths for the extension of the Vestry's stoneyard. To meet this expenditure the Commissioners borrowed a sum of <£3,000 from the London County Council, and obtained a grant of £1,576 13s. from the Poor Kate. The total payments from the Poor Rate since the adoption of the Act in 1846 to this Lady Day amount to £36,932 3s. 1d. on the rates. 51 The Commissioners have, however, applied their surplus receipts, amounting to £9,350, in aid of the Poor Rate, making a net charge of £27,582 3s. 1d. on the rates. It will thus be seen that for the sum of £27,582 3s. 1d. the ratepayers have acquired a freehold building which contains, in addition to the necessary offices, store rooms, boiler house, apartments for Superintendent, the following accommodation:— Two Swimming Baths (open from April to October, including Sunday mornings), first class, water surface 60ft. by 22ft.; charge, including use of costume, 6d. This Bath is devoted to the use of ladies on the whole of Wednesday in each week. Second class, charge (week days), 2d. Private baths (open throughout the year), 36 first class (23 for men and 13 for women); charge, warm bath 6d., cold 3d., including use of two towels. 54 second class (41 for men and 13 for women); charge, warm bath 2d., cold 1d., including use of one towel. Laundry (open throughout the year). 84 separate washing and drying compartments, mechanical wringers, iron room and mangling room. Inclusive charge 2d. per hour. A list of the Public Baths and Wash-houses Committee is given on page 9. CHARITY INQUIRY. In February last Mr. W. A. Wigram, Barrister-at-Law, Assistant Charity Commissioner, opened a public Inquiry at the Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, into the Charities of the Parish, including that administered by the Rector and Churchwardens and Vestrymen under the will of the late Mr. Peter Le Quainter. The Chairman of the Vestry attended D 2 52 and expressed the dissatisfaction felt by the late Trustees with the administration of the Craven Pest House Charity, and several Vestrymen and Ratepayers attended and expressed their views with respect to this, Le Quainter's and other Charities. The Report of the Commissioners had not been issued at Lady-day last. CHARITIES. Le Quainter's Charity. The only Charity which i.s administered by the Vestry is that known as Le Quainter's, which arose from a bequest in I782 by Mr. Peter Le Quainter, formerly a resident in Piccadilly. He directed that the income should be "equally distributed at Christmas amongst twenty poor persons who are or have been housekeepers in the Parish, and such as the Rector and Churchwardens and the other gentlemen for the time being who shall compose the Vestry of the said Parish of St. James, shall deem to be proper objects, and the most deserving to partake of the same." The income from the Charity amounts to nearly £300, and application for forms of petition should be made to the Vestry Clerk, at the Vestry Hall, early in the month of October. As mentioned in previous reports, the Vestry some time since adopted a number of suggestions, made by a Special Committee appointed to consider the subject of the future administration of this Charity, but were waiting the consent of the Charity Commissioners to the contemplated alterations. The Commissioners had deferred the consideration of the matter until after the contemplated inquiry into the history and work of the administration of the 53 Charities of the Parish, and it will be seen, by reference to the previous subject, that this inquiry has been held, and that the Vestry are now waiting the report of the Commissioners. A statement of the Accounts of this Charity for the year 1896 is given on page 160. St. Martin's Almshouse and Pension Charity. This Charity is administered under a scheme established by the Charity Commissioners in 1886, the governing body comprising ex-officio, co-optative, and representative Trustees. Two of the latter are elected by the Vestry of this Parish, the present representatives being Mr. Morle and Mr. Winnett. The Charity has almshouses in Bayham Street, Camden Town, and grants pensions in certain cases, for which persons of good character, who have been residents in St. James's for live years or more, and have not received parochial relief, are eligible. Notices are published when vacancies arise, by the Clerk to the Trustees, Mr. G. W. Murnane, Town Hall, Charing Cross. A copy of the Accounts of this Charity for the year 1896 will be found on pages 166-9. The Craven Pest House Charity. Five Parishes participate in the benefits of this Charity, viz.:— St. Martin-in-the-Fields; St. George, Hanover Square; St. Clement Danes; St. Paul, Covent Garden; and St. James. The income of the Charity is applied, under an order of the Court of Chancery, to the maintenance of 24 beds in King's College Hospital and 16 in Charing Cross Hospital, for the reception of poor patients from the live Parishes mentioned. The hospitals are also 54 required to afford out-treatment to all poor persons resident in any of the five parishes, who may be sent by the Trustees. Parishioners requiring hospital treatment may obtain letters at any time during office hours, on application at the Vestry Hall. Four Trustees are appointed on the nomination of the Vestry, the present Trustees being Messrs. Angold, Scarlett, Walker and Truman. The Clerk to the Trustees is Mr. C. Isaacson, of 16, Houghton Street, w.c. A copy of the Accounts of this Charity is given on page 158. Samuel Jackson. The Income (£71 10s.) arising from this bequest was, by a scheme of the Charity Commissioners, directed to be applied in contributing to the funds of any Convalescent Hospital, for the reception, treatment, and maintenance of deserving poor persons of either sex who shall have partially recovered from, but shall still be incapacitated to some extent by, the effects of accident, injury or sickness, with the object of promoting their complete restoration to health. The Charity is administered by the Rector, Churchwardens, and Overseers for the time being. Applications for letters to be made any week-day morning to the Clerk of the Trustees, Mr. Redman, at St. James's Church Vestry, Piccadilly. A copy of the Accounts of this Charity is given on page 162. Alice Knightsbridge and Others. The income (£56 14s. 8d.) derivable from the above bequests, is at the disposal of the Rector and Churchwardens for the time being. 55 The practice has been to dispose of it as follows:— £ s. d. Rector's Sick and Visiting Fund 15 2 10 Ditto, Coals 2 11 10 Churchwardens (Coals and Bread) 25 0 0 Offertory School Fund (in accordance with the intention of some of the Benefactors) 14 0 0 £56 14 8 The Hon. Sec. to the Charity is Mr. James Redman, as above. A copy of the Accounts of this Charity is given on page 160. Offertory Schools. The object of this Charity is for the advancement of the education of boys at any Public Elementary School or Schools in the Parish, by means of Prizes and Exhibitions. The Charity is administered by Governors, under a scheme of the Charity Commissioners, and the income is invariably devoted to the National and Sunday Schools, Great Windmill Street. A copy of the Accounts of this Charity is given on page 159. Burlington School for Girls. This School is administered under a scheme established by the Charity Commissioners in the year 1875, and two of the Governors are elected by the Vestry, the present representatives being Mr. F. H. Bingham and Mr. J. B. Colwill. The school fees, which are payable in advance at the commencement of each term, are as follows:—Entrance, 5s. for one pupil, and 2s. 6d. for each additional pupil from the same family. Tuition for a pupil entering the school above the age of 10 years, £1 12s. 6d. per term. For a pupil 56 entering the school under the age of 10 years, £1 7s. 6d. per term, so long as she shall continue in the school. Dinners are supplied at 7d. each, or 2s. 6d. for the week of five days. Application for admission should be made to the Head Mistress at the School House, Old Burlington Street, where particulars of the course of study may be obtained. A statement of Accounts of the School for the year 1896 is given on page 157. Archbishop Tenison's United Grammar School for Boys. This School, the object of which is to provide a sound, practical, and liberal middle-class education on moderate terms, was founded by Archbishop Tenison, in the year 1685, and reconstituted by a scheme of the Endowed Schools Commissioners, dated January 81st, 1871. The school fees, which are payable in advance at the commencement of each term, are as follows:— For boys under 10 years of age, £1 15s. per term; over 10 years, £2 5s. per term. The fees include payment for the use of apparatus, books, and stationery. Pianoforte, £1 5s. per term. Application for admission, and all particulars, can be obtained on application to the Head Master, Mr. John F. Arnold, at the Schools, Leicester Square, between the hours of 12 and 1 o'clock. Three of the Trustees are elected by the Vestry. Vacancies occurred during the year by the expiration of the term for which Mr. W. Winnett had been elected, by the death of Mr. E. Tysall, and by the resignation of Mr. H. Dawes, and the following members have been appointed to fill the vacancies, viz.:— Messrs. Winnett, Bennett, and Truman. A statement of the Acccounts of the Schools for the year 1896 is given on page 156. 57 Mrs. Ann Newton's Charity. This Charity, for the apprenticing of one poor boy of St. James's annually from the Union School, which was formerly administered by the Board of Governors and Directors of the Poor, has, owing to the abolition of that Board, been placed, by an order of the Charity Commissioners, dated the 15th August, 1890, under the management of the Guardians of the Poor elected for this Parish. A copy of the Accounts for the year 1896 is given on page 161. Broder and Others. This income (£21 6s.) from this Charity, for the relief of poor housekeepers and others, is entirely at the disposal of the Rector. It has been usual for the Rector to hand £15 14s. 8d. to the Sick and Visiting Fund, the balance, £5 l1s. 4d., being applied to special cases as they arise. A copy of the Accounts of this Charity for the year 1896 is given on page 162. Ann Forster. The income of this Charity is to be applied in keeping Forster's tomb in proper order, and the balance is to be distributed each year amongst six poor deserving women. The Charity is at the disposal of the Rector only, and he has been in the habit of dividing the available balance, after tomb expenses, into gifts of £1 10s. each, and distributing these amongst the several Ecclesiastical Districts of the Parish. The Hon. Secretary to the Charity is Mr. Redman, as before. A copy of the Accounts of this Charity for the year 1896 is given on page 163. 58 Atkinson Morley Fund. The income (£75 10s. 8d.) is divided, after deducting working expenses, among ten widows of tradesmen who, at their death, were tradesmen of the Parish, and had been rated at not less than £20 per annum. The Charity is administered by the Rector and appointed Trustees. The Clerk is Mr. Redman, as before. A copy of the Accounts of this Charity for the year 1896 is given on page 163. James Payler. The income of this Charity is divided among 18 poor persons resident in the Parish, £1 10s. being given to each. It is customary for the Rector to select eight, the senior Churchwarden six, and the junior Churchwarden four. The Clerk is Mr. Redman, as before. A copy of the Accounts of this Charity is given on page 164. Smith's. The income of this Charity (£2 13s.) is at the disposal of the Rector, and is to be divided annually at Christmas amongst the poor of the Parish. It is the practice of the Rector to add the above amount to the Sick and Visiting Fund. A copy of the Accounts of this Charity for the year 1896 is given on page 165. St. James's Scholarship Fund. The income (£28 15s. 1d.) is divided equally between the Tenison and Burlington Schools. The Fund is administered by the Rector and Churchwardens. A copy of the Accounts of this Charity for the year 1896 is given on page 164. 59 Blanchard's Charity. Mr. William Blanchard, late of Regent Street, who died in January, 1892, left £500 upon trust to the Rector and Churchwardens of this Parish to invest the same in any of the securities sanctioned by his will, and to distribute the income arising therefrom at their discretion annually amongst the poor of the Parish. The sum mentioned has been received and invested in Consols in the name of the Official Trustees of Charitable Funds. A copy of the Accounts of this Charity for the year 1896 is given on page 165. Mrs. Elizabeth Dennis Denyer. The income of this Charity (£109) is divided into seven equal parts and allotted to seven poor spinsters, not under 60 years of age, of general good character, constant, when able, in their attendance at some place of public worship, and who have never been beggars. The several said persons, when so selected, to receive the said bequests during their natural lives. The distribution is made by the Rector and Churchwardens of St. Luke, Chelsea, and the Trustees of the Charity. The Parishioners of St. Luke, Chelsea; St. Pancras; St. James, Westminster; and Christ Church, Newgate Street, have precedence, provided the applicants are equally deserving. Emanuel Hospital— Lady Dacre Pensioners. This Trust, which is governed by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the City of London (Govenors of Emanuel Hospital, Registered), provides pensions of £25 per annum, 60 it the income of the Charity is sufficient, to 40 poor people, 20 men and 20 women, of not less than 56 years of age, who have been householders or residents for not less than two years immediately preceding election, either in St. James's, or any of the Parishes comprising the City and Liberties of Westminster, the Parish of Chelsea, or the Parish of Hayes, Middlesex, and are members of the Church of England. The income of the Charity is derived from property at Brandesburton, Yorks., and invested funds amounting to £47,681 1s. 6d. Notices are published, when vacancies arise, by the Clerk to the Trustees, Guildhall, E.C. FINANCIAL. Poor Rate.— This Account commenced with a balance due to the Treasurer of £2,385 2s. 3½d. The receipts during the year amounted to £133,707 10s. 4d., and expenditure to £135,651 18s. 1d., leaving a balance due to the Treasurer of £4,271 5s. 6½d. at the close of the account at Lady-day. The balances at the commencement and the end of the year include the sum of £58 4s. 6d. disallowed by the District Auditor at Michaelmas, 1895. Sewers and General Rate.— It will be seen on reference to the accounts, commencing on page 130, that the year commenced with a balance in the Treasurer's and Vestry Clerk's hands amounting to £12,117 0s. 11½d. The sum of £72,858 9s. 4d. was received during the twelve months, and the expenditure for the same period amounted to £74,549 1s. 8d., leaving a balance of £10,426 8s. 7½d. on the 25th March, 1897. Included in this expenditure of £74,549 1s. 8d. is an amount of £1,503 2s. 6d., advanced out of the common 61 funds of the Vestry to meet payments in anticipation for Loan of £18,000 (No. 11, see pages 131 and 140). Against the balance of £10,426 8s. 7½d., there were on the 25th March, 1897, debts and liabilities properly chargeable to income amounting to £15,069 0s. 5d. The assets (exclusive of the cash balance) were estimated to realise £3,004 17s. 4d., leaving a sum of £1,637 14s. 5½d. to be carried to the debit of the present year. LOANS. The negotiations for the loan of £8,850 which the Vestry mentioned, in their last report, were proceeding with the London County Council to meet the cost of paving works in Piccadilly, &c., resulted in the Council offering to advance £8,350. The £500 deducted from the Vestry's original application was in respect of King's Arms Yard and Duck Lane, neither of which localities have a through thoroughfare, the Council deciding that they were not entitled to advance moneys for the re-paving of such description of street. The expenditure under this Loan (No. 8, see page 141) has been completed during the past year and an amount of £33 6s. 11d. unexpended (see page 132) been transferred to the credit of the General Rate. Another Loan for £1,700 to defray the cost of building Underground Conveniences in Great Marlborough Street has been taken up by the Vestry during the past year. At Lady-day last the expenditure under this Loan (No. 9, see pages 141 and 144) had not been completed, and there was a balance in hand of £140 19s. 5d., the liabilities, at the same date, being estimated at £62 12s. 6d. 62 Yet another Loan was taken up by the Vestry during the past financial year, that of £3,850, to defray the cost of the installation of Electric Light in the main thorougfares of the Parish. At Lady-day last there was a balance in hand of £1,728 8s. 7d. (see page 144), and the liabilities amounted to £1,177 19s. 2d. Further liabilities have been incurred since that date, but the Vestry do not anticipate there will be any charge on the General Rates in respect of work executed under this Loan. At Lady-day last the Vestry were negotiating a Loan of £18,000 to defray the cost of re-paving Regent Street, Shaftesbury Avenue, &c. Certain liabilities incurred in anticipation of this Loan have been met during the past financial year out of the common funds of the Vestry, and at Lady-day last there was a further liability of £2,000 14s. 3d. (see page 144). The amounts outstanding on these Loans and the interest paid in respect of the same, together with other particulars, will be found on page 146. RATES were made by the Vestry during the year as follows:— Amount in the pound Poor Rate (including, in addition to charges for the Relief of the Poor, Police Hate, expenses of the London County Council, Equalization charge, contributions to the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, and other general charges) S. d. 3 4 General Rate for the lighting, maintenance, repairing and cleansing of streets, watering carriageways, administration expenses, and precepts of the School Board for London 1 6½ Sewers Rate, for the maintenance, repairing and cleansing of sewers vested in the Vestry 0 1½ Total 5 0 63 The rates for each of the two previous years were 4s. 9d. and 4s. 6½d. in the pound respectively. The following statement shows the amount of the rates nd the collection thereof:— Poor Rate:— £ s. d. Amount of Rate as levied 131,406 6 8 Arrears of former rates 723 8 9½ Rates on property assessed during the year 916 0 8 £133,045 16 1½ Collected 128,406 15 4 Loss from empty houses, &c. 3,725 10 11½ Arrears at close of year 913 9 10 £133,045 16 1½ Other Parochial Rates Amount of rates levied 65,703 3 4 Arrears of former rates 376 9 1½ Rates on property assessed during the year 456 5 3½ £66,535 17 9 Collected 64,206 14 101 Loss from empty houses, &c. 1,860 13 7½ Arrears at close of year 468 9 3 £66,535 17 9 Under the provisions of the Local Acts of Parliament relating to the Parish of St. James, the rates are made annually, but are recoverable by four quarterly instalments. For the convenience of Parishioners, however, it has become the practice to collect the rates in two half-yearly sums. In view of the increasing demands by Central Authorities over whose expenditure the Vestry does not possess any control, although for economy in collection the funds are 64 raised with the local rates, the following approximate statement will be of interest to ratepayers:— Total amount expended, £222,838 2s.

It will be seen that of the total sum raised under the name of local rates, a very small proportion is applicable to strictly local expenditure, no less than £159,500 5s. 10d. of the total of £222,838 2s. having been paid over during the year to various authorities over whose expenditure the Vestry and other Parochial Boards have no control. In other words, out of every shilling raised as local rates in St. James's, not more than threepence is spent by the Parochial Authorities. MAKING AND COLLECTION OF RATES. The question of taking steps to alter the provisions of the Local Act with respect to the making and collection of rates has engaged the attention of the Vestry at different periods during the last two years. It was mentioned in the last Annual Report that although the Vestry had passed a formal Resolution, as suggested by the Local Government Board, applying to the Board for a Provisional Order to alter the provisions of the Act referred to, the Motion for confirming this Resolution, which is required by statute, was lost by one vote at the subsequent meeting of the Vestry. The question was, however, again raised during the year to which this Report relates, when the Vestry in November last resolved to apply to the Local Government Board for a Provisional Order to repeal those sections of the Local Act, 2 Geo. III., cap. 58, which necessitate the making of the rates at Easter to cover the twelve months from the previous 5th January, and to amend the same as far as may be necessary, in order that the rates may be made prospectively, instead of retrospectively, and collected within the quarter, as the case may be, which the E 66 said rates are intended to cover. The Vestry were of opinion that those sections of the Local Act referred to should be repealed and amended so far as might be necessary, so that the rates could be made and collected in accordance with the general law, and that as the rates are collected upon an estimate up to Lady-day it would not be necessary to make any rate or assessment for the quarter ending Lady-day following the repeal of the sections referred to. The Vestry at the same time decided to ask the Local Government Board to include in the said order, if they had authority so to do, power to enable the Vestry, as the Local Authority for the Parish, to make the rate instead of the present body, viz., the Rector, Vestrymen, Churchwardens and Overseers. These Resolutions were confirmed at the subsequent meeting of the Vestry as required by section 2 of the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1867. The Board, however, subsequently expressed an opinion that if an alteration were made in the authority to make the rate the power should be transferred to the Overseers in accordance with the general law; but the Vestry preferred that no alteration should be made in respect to this matter at the present time, unless the Board could see their way to transfer the power of making the rates to the Vestry instead of the body named in the Local Act. The Vestry's application was under consideration by the Local Government Board at Lady-day, 1897. QUINQUENNIAL VALUATION LIST. Reference was made in the last Annual Report of the Vestry to the appeals to Special and Quarter Sessions which were made by occupiers of property against the assessments inserted in the Quinquennial Valuation List, the result of these appeals being to reduce the totals of 67 the Quinquennial List by £5,878 gross, £4,905 rateable. While the Justices correct the individual assessments in the List, they have no power to alter the totals of the List without an appeal being made to them against such totals as provided by the Act, the result being that unless the totals are altered on appeal the contributions for County purposes would be levied on a total value which is greater than that which actually exists. The Vestry, therefore, appealed to the Court of Quarter Sessions against the totals of the Valuation List which came into force on the 6th April, 1890, when the Court ordered the totals of the Lists to be altered in accordance with the reductions made on appeal to Special and Quarter Sessions, thereby effecting an appreciable reduction in the Vestry's contribution during the Quinquennial period towards the rates levied for County purposes. The amounts paid under precept to other authorities for the half-year to Michaelmas, 1896, had of course been levied on the total as stated in the List and on the alteration therefore made by the Court application was made to the proper authorities for a return of the respective amounts overpaid in accordance with the provisions contained in section 44 of the Metropolis Valuation Act, 1869. The amounts paid in excess were in due course refunded to the Vestry. The assessment of new buildings and alterations caused by variations in the value of old buildings during the year 189G-7 has increased the total assessment of the Parish to the following amounts:— Value at Lady Day, 1897. Gross value £979,259 Rateable value £814,204 E 2 68 VESTRY PROPERTY. Vestry Hall.— The Vestry Hall and Offices have been cleaned as usual during the Summer recess, at a cost of £7 10s. 2d. With a view of facilitating (he work of the Vestry, the Vestry Hall and Stoneyard have been connected with a private telephone wire. The Vestry, at the commencement of the year, received an application from Mr. J. J. Johnson, Rate and Tax Collector, for the use of an office in the Yestry Hall for the receipt of Taxes, and having learnt that he would only require the office for one afternoon a week, from 1 to 5 o'clock, for six months in the year, granted the use of the Committee Room for the time and purpose mentioned, subject to Mr. Johnson paying the sum of £10 a year for the use of the said office. This stipulation was agreed to. Sanitary Shelter, 6. Dufour's Place.— This Shelter, which was established by the Vestry a few years ago for the use of families during the disinfection of their homes, has been provided with a suitable bath room and requisites. Dressing gowns have also been obtained for the occupants for use whilst their own garments are being disinfected. Disinfector— The new Disinfector, to which reference was made in last year's Report, was erected in the early part of the year, aud has been used for disinfecting bedding, clothing, &c., for parishioners on 122 occasions compared with 118 in 1895-6 and 111 in 1894-5. During the time that the apparatus was being erected the disinfecting was carried out by Mr. Lacey, of Wandsworth. Mortuary.— The bodies of 29 persons have been received into the mortuary during the year, as compared with 45 during the previous twelve months. 69 Medical men, the clergy, district visitors, and others who are specially brought into contact with the poor, are invited to assist the Vestry in preventing the spread of disease which may arise from the retention of a corpse in a room occupied perhaps by a number of people in a thicklypopulated neighbourhood, by making known, as occasion requires, the provision made for the reception of bodies in a decent manner, and with all possible deference to the natural feelings of the bereaved relatives. As the main object of providing a mortuary and disinfecting apparatus is to protect the parishioners at large against the spread of infectious disease, either may be used without charge. Information as to the mode of proceeding in such a case may be freely obtained at the Vestry Hall. OTHER PARISH PROPERTY. Eleven freehold houses on the east side of Marshall Street were purchased in the year 1819, for parochial purposes. Two of the houses are now absorbed in the Workhouse premises, and the site of five others has been utilised for the erection of the Public Baths and Wash-houses. The remaining four houses have for some years past been let on repairing agreements. During the year the Vestry gave notice to the tenant of No. 23, Marshall Street, to give up possession of the house at Lady-day, 1897, and also took into consideration the conditions of tenancy of Nos. 20, 21 and 22, with the result that the agreements with the tenants of Nos. 20 and 21 were renewed at an increased rental, and the tenant of No. 22 was given notice to give up possession of the premises at Midsummer this year. The rent received for these four houses, together with the sum receivable from the Westminster Union in respect of that portion of the Workhouse premises belonging to the Parish of St. James, is applied in aid of the Poor Rate. 70 Reference was made in the last report to the permission granted to the Guardians to put in window openings, door opening and projecting landing in that portion of the party structure between 23, Marshall Street, and the new Back House on certain conditions, but that the agreement had not at Lady-day, 1896, been entered into. Owing to a difficulty in settling various points in the agreement the matter was still unsettled at the 25th March last. SCAVENGING, DUST REMOVAL, &c. Under the system adopted by the Vestry, the roadsweepers are employed and paid by the Vestry, but the collection and removal of house dust, street refuse, &c., are done under contract. The total cost of scavenging and dust removal for the past year, as given in the accounts, was £9,718 17s. 8d. compared with £8,917 for the previous year. The following is a statement of the number of loads reported to have been removed from the Parish during the year:— Cart Loads. Wagon Loads. Dust — 11,519 Slop — 7,382 The cost of Street Watering in 1895-6 was £1,268 18s. 5½d., and for the year ended Lady-day, 1897, was £1,505 6s. 9d., an increase of £236 8s. 3½d. DUSTING AND SLOPPING. The Special Committee appointed last year to consider and report as to the desirability of the dusting and slopping of the Parish being carried out by the Vestry with its own staff and plant, have carefully considered the subject referred to them, and in June last submitted a full and 71 detailed report, together with alternative estimates of the cost of the work. The Committee expressed the opinion that it was desirable for the Vestry to undertake the dusting and slopping of the Parish with its own staff and plant, and recommended the Vestry to adopt one of the detailed estimates submitted by them. This the Vestry, after mature deliberation, decided not to do, and passed a resolution to the effect that it is not desirable for the Vestry to carry out this work with its own staff and plant. WORKMEN'S SICK FUND. A sick fund, on the principle of a slate club, limited to the Vestry's workmen, has been in operation since the 1st August, 1887. The Vestry contribute the sum of 5s. a week to the funds of the club, in lieu of allowing sick pay to individual workmen. The bulk of the surplus is divided among the members at Christmas in the usual way, but one of the rules requires that a balance of not less than £10 be carried forward at the end of each year to provide for the payment of sick allowances before sufficient money has been received from members' subscriptions to meet necessary outgoings. REMOVAL OF SNOW. In anticipation of the approach of winter, the Vestry sought and obtained permission from the Thames Conservators and the London County Council, to cast clean snow over the parapet of the Victoria Embankment into the river. Arrangements were also made for the hire of additional horses and carts should occasion require. CONTRACTS FOR WORKS AND MATERIALS. Particulars of the various contracts entered into or continued during the year are given on pages 147 and 148. 72 STREET LIGHTING. On the 25th March, 1896, there were 822½ public lamps in the various thoroughfares of the Parish, and this number, in consequence of the adoption of electric light in the main thoroughfares of the parish, was decreased by 80 during the year. At Lady-day, 1897, there were 716 ordinary street lamps, and 26½ metered lamps attached to urinals, refuges, &c., making a total of 742½. The cost of lighting 3 lamps on refuges in the Haymarket is borne equally between this Vestry and the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. This accounts for the ½-lamp just referred to. The ordinary street lamps consume 5ft. of gas per hour, and are lighted, extinguished, and cleaned by the Gas Company at an inclusive sum of £2 19s. 4d. per lamp per annum. As regards the refuge lamps, payment is made according to the consumption of gas as registered by meter. The total expenditure for street lighting (gas and electric) during the past year amounted to £2,871 10s. 3d., as compared with £2,965 6s. 4d. for the previous twelve months. This sum is exclusive of maintenance, repairs and new lamp-posts, lanterns and fittings, which involved further payments amounting to £482 10s. 4d. net. PRIVATE LAMPS. The Vestry some years since decided not to permit the erection of private lamps except upon the following conditions:— 1. That no part of such Lamps shall be less than 10 feet in height from the public footway. 2. That no such Lamps shall in any case project further than the inside of the kerb bounding the footway. 73 3. That all such Lamps shall be entirely free from writing or any trade devices, except in such cases as Medical Men, Post Offices, Sweeps, Fire Engines, or other positions where they would be a public guide in cases of emergency. 4. That no such Lamp shall be suspended by ball and socket joint only. 5. That no Lamps on posts be agreed to unless they are kept lighted the whole night. 6. That a sketch of the proposed Lamps with their dimensions, and of any intended inscription thereon, be submitted with the application to the Vestry for approval. PROPOSED LIGHTING OF THE MAIN STREETS WITH ELECTRIC LIGHT. It will doubtless be remembered as mentioned in the last Annual Report that the Vestry in the latter part of the year 1895-6 resolved to light the main thoroughfares of the Parish with electric light, on the basis of the scheme then submitted by the Works Committee, and at the same time referred it to the Works Committee with instructions to take the necessary steps for carrying the proposal into effect. This Committee, after giving the subject very careful consideration, submitted the following report to the Vestry, which was approved and adopted. It will be seen on reference to this Report that it was suggested that the cost of providing and erecting five lamps in Piccadilly and St. James's Street on the boundary of the Parishes of St. James, and St. George, Hanover Square, and of lighting and maintaining the same should be borne at the joint expense of the two Vestries. The Vestry of St. Martinin-the-Fields were similarly asked to contribute in respect of three lamps proposed to be erected in Coventry Street on the boundary of the two Parishes. The St. Martin's Vestry willingly consented to share the expense of the three lamps referred to, but the Vestry regret to have to 74 report that the Vestry of St. George, Hanover Square, declined to entertain the proposal that they should bear a moiety of the cost. Bearing in mind that a portion of the streets proposed to be lighted by electricity are situate in their parish, and that the complete effect of the electric lighting in St. James's Street is somewhat spoilt by the omission of three lamps in that thoroughfare which the Vestry, in consequence of the action of the St. George's Vestry, decided not to erect, the action of the latter body is the more regrettable. A loan of £3,850 for defraying the cost of the proposed work was obtained from the London County Council, repayable by equal annual instalments of principal within fifteen years, interest being charged on the amount for the time being outstanding at 3 per cent. The work had not quite been completed at Lady-day, 1897. REPORT of Works Committee with reference to the steps taken for carrying the proposal to light the main thoroughfares of the parish with electric Light into effect. Your Works Committee beg to report that they have had under consideration the reference by the Vestry of the 16th January, 1896, authorising them to take the necessary steps for carrying the proposal to light the main thoroughfares of the Parish with Electric Light into effect. Your Committee deemed it advisable when the subject was first considered to refer the matter to a Sub-Committee to consider and report on the question. 75 The Sub-Committee having given the subject very careful consideration, submitted a report (a copy of which is annexed hereto) suggesting various proposals to give effect to the Vestry's resolution. This Report having been fully considered and approved by your Committee, and the recommendations contained therein adopted, they beg to report that, in pursuance of the authority delegated to them by the Vestry, they have ordered the necessary columns and lamps for lighting the main thoroughfares decided upon in accordance with the suggestions of the Sub-Committee before referred to, and have taken such other action in the matter as was deemed necessary, and your Committee accordingly recommend that the action taken be approved. All which is submitted. WILLIAM JENKINS, 8th July, 1896. Chairman. REPORT of Works Sub-committee appointed with reference to the steps to be taken for carrying the proposal to light the main thoroughfares of the parish with electric Light into effect. To the Works Committee of the above-named Vestry. Your Sub-Committee beg to report as follows:— Your Sub-Committee was appointed on the 29th January, 1896, to consider and report as to the steps to be taken for carrying the resolution of the Vestry to light certain of the main thoroughfares of the Parish with Electric Light into effect. Your Committee have had under consideration, and given very careful attention to the subject referred to them. 76 It will be remembered that the Vestry in January last decided on the recommendation of the "Works Committee to light the main thoroughfares of the Parish with Electric Light on the basis of the scheme set out in the Committee's report, and referred it back to the Committee to take the necessary steps for carrying the proposal into effect. The Scheme was based on an estimate of 60 lamps for lighting Regent Street, Piccadilly Circus, Shaftesbury Avenue, Coventry Street, Lower Regent Street, Waterloo Place, Pall Mall, St. James's Street, and Piccadilly. The St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company undertook to light the said lamps for the same hours as the gas lamps are now alight, and maintain them in full running order (i.e., clean, re-carbon, &c.) for the sum of £30 per annum each, the Vestry having to supply and erect the columns and provide lamps, the Company to supply all mains, connections, switches, &c., &c., as required. The proposal of the Company was subject to a satisfactory arrangement being come to as regards the period of the contract, to enable the Company to make provision for the capital outlay to be incurred by them. Your Sub-Committee, in order to make themselves thoroughly acquainted with the various systems of public street lighting by electricity now adopted in various parts of London and elsewhere, deemed it expedient to inspect the street lighting in a few typical districts where electricity has been adopted as an illuminant. They accordingly visited Hampstead, St. Pancras, City, Brighton and Islington, for the purpose of examining the light and gaining information on the subject referred to them. Hampstead Public Street Lighting.—The Vestry of Hampstead are lighting Finchley Road by arc lamps on the alternate sides of the street. There are only 23 lamps at present running, the height from the ground to the centre of the arc being 22ft. Siemen's double carbon 10.ampere lamp is used with 22in. diam. opalescent globe. The lamps are about 80 yard apart—cost of column, £10 5s. each, and lantern, automatic cut-out and switch, £12 10s. The Electricity Department charge the Vestry 6d. per unit, less rebate, for supplying the light, the department providing mains, columns, &c. 77 St. Pancras Public Street Lighting.—The St. Pancras Vestry are lighting 97 arc lamps (57 centre lighting and 40 side lighting) in Euston Road, Tottenham Court Road, Camden Road and other parts of the Parish. The height from the ground to the centre of the arc for centre lighting is 25ft., and side lighting 22ft. Gin. Brockie Pell, 10-ampere, 32-hour double carbon lamps are used, with the ordinary thin opalescent globe. The continuous current is used. For centre lighting the lamps are apart at an average distance of 60 yards, and for side lighting 73 yards. The Electricity Department charge the Vestry 5d. per unit for the current as metered, such price covering the capital expenditure for mains, columns, &c. The short columns cost £9 10s. Tall ditto, £13 10s. Lamps, £11 5s. each, and head pieces to carry lamp, &c., £7. The lamps are on alternate circuits, and at 1 and 2 a.m. some circuits are switched out where there is little traffic after midnight. City of London Public Street Lighting.—The Electric Arc Lamps in the City are lighted by the City of London Electric Lighting Company. The lamps are mostly erected at the sides of the streets and on refuges. There are 489 lamps now lighted by electricity, the height from the ground to the centre of the arc being 18ft. 6in. Two types of lamp are used, namely, the Thomson Houston and the Brush, all taking a current of 10 amperes. The lamps are arranged at an average distance of 40 yards apart. The Corporation pay to the Company £26 per lamp per annum, the Company providing mains, columns, &c. This low rate was a concession granted to the Corporation when the Company obtained powers to supply electrical energy in the City. No particulars could be obtained as to the cost of the columns, lamps, &c. Brighton Public Street Lighting.— The Brighton Corporation, who themselves are undertakers for the supply of Electricity, are running 165 arc lamps for lighting certain portions of the Borough, while they have an extension of 95 lamps in operation. Hide lighting has been adopted except at refuges. The lamps (centre of arc) are 24ft. from the ground in those cases where bracket posts are used, and 28 feet where upright posts are adopted. Crompton-Pochin 12-ampere lamps 7S are used on the sea front, and Brockie Poll 7.ampere in the streets, the globes being graduated opal, denser at top than bottom. The continuous current is used. The lamps are placed 50 yards apart. Labour and carbons are charged to the Corporation by the Electricity Department at actual cost. Current is charged at the same rate as private lighting, i.e., 7d. per unit for first, hour per day, and 3d. per unit afterwards. The average price per unit charged for street lighting works out about 8'4d. The capital expenditure for columns, lamps, &c., was paid out of the District Fund Account, the Electricity Department bearing the cost of the mains. The approximate cost of providing and fixing each column and lamp is £60. The columns are of a very ornamental pattern, and surmounted by a canopy, there by giving a handsome appearance to the lamps. Islington Public Street Lighting. The Islington Vestry is probably the latest local authority which has undertaken its own electricity supply and is lighting some of its main thoroughfares. There are at present 98 lamps running in Upper Street, Holloway Road and Seven Sisters Road, all being at the side of the streets, with the exception of seven on refuges. The lamps are 20 foot from the ground to the centre of the arc. CromptonPochin 12-ampere single carbon lamps are used, with oval globes, which are to be replaced shortly by spherical globes. The lamps are about 00 yards apart on alternate sides of the streets. The Electricity Department charge the Vestry 5d. per unit, or about £45 per lamp per annum, such price covering all expenditure for mains, columns, &c. The providing and fixing each column and lamp cost about £30. The alternating current is used, transformed for street lighting purposes by means of rectifiers into a pulsating current continuous in direction. Local experiments for the purpose of ascertaining the actual advantages of the electric light and the most suitable height and description of the proposed lamps have also been carried out. As mentioned in the Report of the Works Committee to the Vestry of the 8th January last, two arc lamps of different heights were put up in Regent Street, by Vigo Street and Swallow Street, for the purpose of ascertaining the effect of centre lighting in the thoroughfare in question. These lamps, which were fixed on the 6th December, 1895, were exchanged for more perfect lamps on 79 the 5th May. Your Sub-Committee, after having made their inspection of the various installations in London, came to the conclusion that the proper height of the lamps proposed to be erected for centre lighting would be about 21 or 22ft., giving a column of 18ft. Before, however, finally deciding upon this height, it was resolved to put up three lamps in Regent Street on 18ft. columns one to take the place of the temporary lamp by Vigo Street. This was accordingly done, the two lamps by the New Gallery and Heddon Street being fixed on the 28th May. The four lamps now run two in series. They are the CromptonPochin double carbon arc lamps, to run 32 hours without recarboning, the candle power of each lamp being 2,000, or about 750 actual. The height of the arc from the refuge by Swallow Street is 24ft. 6in., and that of the other three lamps 21ft. 2in. Opaline globes are fixed on the lamps by Swallow Street, New Gallery and Heddon Street. The lamp by Vigo Street was first fitted with a Holophane globe, but this was afterwards changed for the Muranese globe now fixed. An are lamp was also erected on the refuge in front of the Vestry Hall for the purpose of testing the advantages of different kinds of glass for the proposed lamps. Being in a position to judge of the merits of the various methods of arc lighting from the inspections and enquiries made by them, your Sub-Committee came to the conclusion that the columns proposed to be erected in the main thoroughfares should be 18ft. high, and that the lamps to be used should be the Crompton-Pochin Double Carbon Lamp to burn 4 in series, with a current of 10 amperes and for 32 hours without re-carboning, complete with internal automatic cut-out, &c., &c. They accordingly gave instructions to Messrs. Freeman & Co., the Vestry's Engineers, to submit designs to them for an ornamental column suitable for a parish like St. James's, and submit herewith the design (as revised by Mr. J. T. Wimperis, a member of your Sub-Committee), which has been accepted and approved as a most suitable one for such streets as Regent Street, Piccadilly, &c. It will be noticed that it is proposed to have a canopy at the top of the lamp, thereby considerably increasing its effective appearance. This is somewhat similar to the canopy in use at Brighton, which so greatly adds to the ornamental and artistic character of the design. 80 Recognising the importance of having the columns cast only by the best firms, your Sub-Committee caused estimates to be obtained from three well-known firms for the supply of from 65 to 70 ornamental cast-iron pillars, 18ft. high, including carrier for lamp and canopy. The estimates received are as follows:— £ s. d. W. Macfarlane & Co., Glasgow 28 10 0 each W. T. Allen & Co., 132, Queen Victoria St. 22 15 0 ,, Crompton & Co., Limited, Mansion House Buildings, E.C., and Chelmsford 24 14 0 ,, Your Sub-Committee recommend (a) that the estimate of Messrs. W. T. Allen & Co., to supply the columns, &c., complete, at £22 15s. each, according to design submitted, be accepted, and that, inasmuch as it will take at least two months from the date of the order before even the delivery of the lamps can be commenced, and considering the importance of carrying out the proposed works in the streets during the vacation, when traffic is light, an order be at once given for the supply of 60 columns at the price named. Your Sub-Committee also obtained, through Messrs. Freeman & Co., an estimate from Crompton & Co., Limited, the makers of the Crompton-Pochin Lamp, for the supply of from (50 to 70 Crompton-Pochin 10-ampere arc lamps, as before mentioned. Messrs. Crompton's price for these lamps, fitted with the white Muranese globe, the framework of the globe being all copper, is £15 6s. 10d. per lamp. Your Sub-Committee decided to adopt the double carbon lamp in preference to the single carbon, for two or three reasons. This type has been generally adopted. They are supplied with two sets of carbons, one set for every day use, to be trimmed daily, the other set being a reserve, the burning capacity of each set being about 14 hours. With this reserve, provision is made for inclement or foggy weather, necessitating longer hours of burning, and especially for any slight derangement of the lamp, such as the carbons being out of alignment, which otherwise might lead to an extinction. In double carbon lamps the arc on either side is distant only one inch from the central position of the single arc, and which would have no effect in the appearance or the illumination of the lamp. There is also no special complication in the working parts. 81 These lamps will take two or three months to supply, and your Sub-Committee recommend (b) that the said estimate of Crompton & Co., Limited, be accepted, and that an order be at once given for the supply of 65 arc lamps of the description and at the price named. Your Sub-Committeee also submit a plan showing the exact positions of the proposed arc lamps as arranged between the representatives of the Vestry and the Company, and approved by your Sub-Committee. Your Sub-Committee recommend (c) that the positions of the arc lamps proposed to be erected in the main thoroughfares as shown on the plan now submitted be approved and adopted. The positions shown on the plan have been most carefully measured and thought out, due regard being had to the distances between the lamps, the existing refuges and the side streets. It will be noticed from the plan that it is proposed to adopt side lighting in Pall Mall, and centre lighting in all the other thoroughfares. Piccadilly Circus presents considerable difficulties, but the only practicable way of dealing with it appears to be that adopted. Several existing refuges will have to be moved and additional ones erected. be moved and additional ones erected. The total number of lamps shown on the plan is as follows Regent Street 16 Piccadilly 10 St. James's Street 7 Pall Mall 12 Lower Regent Street and Waterloo Place 6 Piccadilly Circus 4 Coventry Street 3 Shaftesbury Avenue 5 Total 63 Of this number, five in St. James's Street and Piccadilly are on the border of the Parish of St. George, Hanover Square, which three in Coventry Street are on the boundary of St. Martm-in-theFields. These lamps will of course light the whole width of the thoroughfares in question, and your Sub-Committee accordingly recommend (d) that the Vestries of the two parishes beforementioned be asked to contribute one half of the cost of providing and erecting the lamps in question, and of lighting and maintaining the same. f 82 Your Sub-Committee would mention that they have had submitted to them a draft agreement prepared by the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company, for giving effect to the arrangement agreed to, and have made certain suggested alterations therein. It is proposed to submit the draft agreement to your Committee before the same is finally approved and settled. Your Sub-Committee note with satisfaction that it is the desire of the Directors of the St. James's Company that this lighting should be carried out in such a manner that will reflect credit on the Vestry and themselves. To this end they propose that a complete system of distributing mains shall be laid direct from the two central stations, so that the whole of the lighting can be controlled from their stations, and so far as the mains are concerned, kept separate from the private supply. In the central stations the public supply circuits would be coupled to the omnibus bars, on to which the whole of the Company's plant makes supply. This arrangement, whilst safeguarding the public supply from any local derangement of the Company's distributing mains, used for the purpose of private supply, would give to the public supply the use and benefit of the whole available plant. Your Sub-Committee's investigations have been somewhat arduous, but they venture to believe that the result of the same, if their proposals are adopted by your Committee, will be such that the public lighting of the main thoroughfares of the Parish will be unequalled by that of any other District, either in London or the Provinces. All which is submitted, WILLIAM JENKINS, 26th June, 1896. Chairman. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS. (a.) That the estimate of Messrs. W. T. Allen & Co., of 132, Queen Victoria Street, E.C., to supply the columns, &c., complete, at £22 15s. each, according to design submitted, be accepted, and that inasmuch as it will take at least two months from the date of the order before even the delivery 83 of the lamps can be commenced, and considering the importance of carrying out the proposed works in the streets during the vacation, when traffic is light, an order be at once given for the supply of 60 columns, At the price named. (b.) That the estimate of Crompton & Co., Limited, to supply Crompton-Pochin 10-ampere arc lamps, fitted with white Muranese globes, at £15 6s. 10d. per lamp inclusive, be accepted, and that an order be at once given for the supply of 65 arc lamps of the description and at the price named. (c.) That the positions of the arc lamps proposed to be erected in the main thoroughfares, as shown on the plan now submitted, be approved and adopted. (d.) That the Vestry of St. George, Hanover Square, be asked to contribute one half of the cost of providing and erecting five lamps in Piccadilly and St. James's Street, on the boundary of the two parishes, and of lighting and maintaining the same, and that the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields be asked to similarly contribute in respect of three lamps proposed to be erected in Coventry Street. STREETS PARTLY SITUATE IN OTHER PARISHES. An order was made by the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 6th March, 1857, placing that portion of Oxford Street, which is situate in the parish of St. James under the jurisdiction of the Vestry of St. Marylebone for all the purposes of the Metropolis Local Management Act. The cost of lighting, paving, cleansing, watering, &c., that portion of the thoroughfare is ascertained annually, and paid by the Vestry. By an order of the Metropolitan Board of Works, dated the 10th August, 1866, specified sections of the followingthoroughfares are placed under the exclusive management of the Vestries of St. James and St. George, Hanover Square, respectively, throughout the entire width thereof, F 2 84 instead of according to the actual Parish Boundary, viz.:— Regent Street, Piccadilly, Burlington Gardens, St. James's Street, and Park Place. No payment is made by either Vestry to the other under this order, the exchange of area being regarded as an equivalent. An order was made by the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 21st December, 1883, placing so much of the carriageway of Wardour Street as lies south of Meard's Court under the exclusive management of the Vestry for the purpose of cleansing and maintenance, and the remainder of the street under the exclusive management, for the same purposes, of the Strand District Board. An arrangement made some years since with the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields for the apportionment of Coventry Street as regards the cleansing and paving, in consequence of the boundary line being somewhat irregular is still in force. PAVING AND DRAINAGE WORKS. Particulars and details of the paving and drainage works carried out during the past year will be found in the Surveyor's Report, commencing on page 113. REFUGES.

That plans and sections of proposed vaults be submitted and deposited with the Vestry. 2. That no deviation of such plan as sanctioned be made during the execution of the work without the consent of the Vestry. 3. That all walls and arches be at least one brick, or nine inches thick. 4. That the space from the upper surface of the pavement to the outside of the vault be in no case less than three feet. 5. That no vault be allowed to project beyond the outside line of kerb where the footway is ten feet or more in width, and in no case shall the outside of the brickwork be carried nearer than three feet six inches to the centre line of the carriageway. SANITARY. It will be seen on reference to the Report of the Medical Officer of Health, commencing on page 181, and the appendices thereto, that continuous attention has been paid to the abatement and removal of nuisances. It is impossible, however, to convey any accurate idea of the extent or value of sanitary work by the mere tabulation of figures. The most satisfactory proof of the value of this department of the Vestry's work is afforded by the reduction in the rate of mortality in the Parish since the creation of a sanitary department some thirty-nine years since. 87 Two officers have been constantly engaged in the work of inspection with a view to detecting and removing nuisances ; but the Vestry are still more anxious to prevent insanitary conditions which give rise to nuisances. With this object they once more appeal to the Parishioners for intelligent co-operation, especially to such as by their avocations are brought into contact with residents in the poorer and more crowded districts. The Vestry will be glad at all times to receive early information of any nuisance or supposed nuisance. Another and most valuable mode of assisting and maintaining a high degree of public health is for each householder to insist upon scrupulous cleanliness being observed in the premises under his control. It cannot be too strongly urged that proper precautions against infection will also do much to insure immunity from sickness generally. The great preventitive of disease is cleanliness—cleanliness in living, cleanliness of person, and cleanliness of surroundings. The Vestry, as the local Sanitary Authority, are constantly striving after this condition of things, but, unless the Parishioners generally heartily co-operate in their several spheres, a great part of the work of the Vestry will be rendered nugatory. DUST REMOVAL. Under their contract with the Vestry, the Dust Contractors are required to send a covered cart to each house in the Parish at least once in every week for the removal of dust, ashes, and house refuse. In addition a cart passes through each street on certain other days in the week. If any difficulty is experienced in obtaining a removal of refuse, application should be made at the Vestry Hall. 88 The removal of house refuse would be greatly facilitated by the general adoption of portable (lust receptacles. These should not on any account be placed in the street, but kept within the householder's premises in some convenient place readily accessible to the dustmen. They should not be so large as not to admit of being taken up by a man unaided. The refuse would thus be removed bodily and speedily, avoiding the dirt and unpleasantness inseparable from the system of transferring the contents of a dustbin to a basket for removal. INFECTIOUS DISEASE NOTIFICATION. During the year ended at Lady-day, 139 certificates were received by the Medical Officer of Health relating to Parishioners suffering from infectious disease, viz.:— Small Pox (modified) 2 Scarlatina 8 Diphtheria 33 Membraneous Croup 3 Erysipelas 20 Scarlet Fever 65 Typhoid Fever 4 Puerperal Fever 2 Enteric Fever 1 Variola (modified) 1 139 INSPECTION OF BAKEHOUSES. The Factory and Workshop Act, 1883, having transferred to the Local Sanitary Authorities the duty of inspecting retail bakehouses, the following abstract of the requirements of the law with regard to cleanliness, ventilation, over- 89 crowding and sanitary condition of retail bakehouses is given for the information of the Parishioners:— 1. A bakehouse to be in conformity with the Acts relating to retail bakehouses, is subject to the following requirements:— (a) It must be kept in a cleanly state, and free from effluvia arising from any drain, privy, or other nuisance. (b) It must not be so overcrowded while work is carried on therein as to be injurious to the health of the persons employed, and shall be ventilated in such a manner as to render harmless, so far as practicable, all the gases, vapours, dust, or other impurities generated in the course of the manufacturing process that may be injurious to health. (c) The ceilings or tops of the bakehouse and all passages and staircases must either be painted with oil, or varnished, or limewashed, or partly painted or varnished and partly limewashed. If painted or varnished, the surface must be covered with three coats of paint or varnish, and renewed once at least in every seven years, and washed with hot water and soap at least once in every six months. Limewashing is to be renewed once at least in every six months. 2. No place on the same level with the bakehouse and forming part of the same building may be used as a sleeping place, unless it is effectually separated from the bakehouse by a partition extending from the floor to the ceiling, and has an external glazed window of at least nine superficial feet in area, of which at least four-and-a-half feet are made to open for ventilation. 3. A bakehouse must not be in such a state as to be on sanitary grounds unfit for use or occupation as a bakehouse. 4. No child, young person, or woman may be employed in a bakehouse contrary to the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878. Penalties are provided in the event of an infringement of the law; bakehouses brought into use after the 31st of May, 1883, are subject to certain further requirements. The bakehouses in the Parish (27 in number) are under periodical inspection by the Sanitary Officers of the Vestry. 90 SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. The following is a list of the articles purchased by the Inspectors, and submitted to the Public Analyst appointed by the Vestry, during the year:— Butter 17 Cocoa 1 Coffee 4 Milk 40 Margarine 1 Mustard 1 Vinegar 3 67 The cost incurred by the Vestry for the year in respect of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, in addition to the costs of the prosecutions referred to, is as follows:— £ s. d. Allowance to Analyst 100 0 0 Purchase of Samples, &c. 0 15 1½ £100 15 1½ SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS. Summonses have been taken out in the following cases:— Adulteration 2 2 Fines were inflicted in each case. In addition to the above mentioned summary cases, proceedings have been taken against certain persons concerned in the management of disorderly houses. 91 DISORDERLY HOUSES AND CONDITION OF THE STREETS. The attention of the Vestry having been called to the desirability of taking some concerted action in conjunction with the Vestries of the neighbouring Parishes, with a view to lessening the annoyance and complaints from time to time received respecting the number of disorderly houses in the neighbourhood, and the condition of the principal streets in this part of London, it was decided to convene a conference of delegates from the Vestries of Westminster, St. George, Hanover Square, St. Martin-in-the-Fields, St. Anne, St. Mary-le-Strand, St. Paul, Covent Garden, and St. Clement Danes, to discuss the question and to see whether any steps could be taken to remedy the evil. All the Parishes named appointed delegates, with the exception of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, who decided to take no action in the matter. The delegates met at the Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, on the 10th November, when, after having had submitted to them the method of procedure adopted by certain other Vestries in the metropolis, for the suppression of disorderly houses, the delegates passed the following resolutions:— 1. That, in the opinion of this Conference, it is desirable that fines paid in connection with prosecutions under the Criminal Law Amendment Act should go to the Treasury instead of to the Police Fund, in order that the costs incurred by Overseers may be defrayed therefrom, in the same manner as under 25 Geo. II., Cap. 36. 2. That this Conference is of opinion that the fines now imposed in convictions of disorderly house keepers are insufficient, and that the maximum limit of the fines should be materially increased. 3. That the Home Secretary be asked to give instructions to the Metropolitan Magistrates to inflict heavier penalties than they now do in cases of conviction of disorderly house keepers. 92 4. That the Government be urged to amend the Criminal Law Amendment Act in such a manner that it shall be a criminal and punishable offence for any person to make money or obtain a livelihood by the prostitution of others. 5. That the Government be urged to make it lawful for the seers of a Parish, after complaint by one ratepayer, to pay out of the rates a reasonable sum for making enquiries and procuring evidence as to disorderly houses. 6. That it be an urgent representation to the Home Secretary to give instructions to the Police to prevent open solicitation, both by men and women, in the streets of London, particularly in the West End, and that, in the discretion of the Magistrate, the evidence of the person annoyed may be dispensed with. 7. That a copy of the Resolutions passed by the Conference be forwarded to the various Boards carrying out the duties of Overseers in the Metropolis. Later in the year the Vestry received a communication from the Vestry of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, and St. George, Bloomsbury, forwarding copy resolutions on the subject of disorderly houses, condition of the streets, and offences against public decency, and inviting the Vestry to appoint delegates to attend the deputation from several neighbouring parishes to wait upon the Home Secretary. To this invitation a reply was given that the Vestry concurred in the views expressed in the resolutions referred to, but at the same time did not think it desirable to take part in a deputation to the Home Secretary, unless such deputation was representative of the whole of the metropolis. On being asked to reconsider their decision by the St. Giles's Vestry, and the Vestry of St. Anne, Soho, the Vestry informed those authorities that if the other Parishes of the Metropolis were invited to send delegates, this Vestry would be pleased to also appoint delegates to join the deputation, as they were still of opinion that the deputation should be representative of the whole of London. 93 Legal proceedings were taken against the keepers of six disorderly houses and clubs in the Parish during the year, and a conviction was obtained in each case, in one case the defendants being sent to prison with hard labour. In two cases proceedings were taken against the owners of the houses, as well as the tenants, and there is little doubt that if this practice can be acted upon more fully, the result, as in the two cases mentioned, would have a beneficial effect. Exorbitant rents are said to be demanded by some owners for their premises, far beyond the letting value of the property, and it is evident that when such rents are obtained the owner is aware of the use to which the premises are intended to be put, and is therefore a party to the use of the premises for immoral purposes. It requires therefore little additional evidence to bring such owners within the provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act. In addition to the six prosecutions mentioned, a number of alleged disorderly houses have been kept under observation, and, in many cases, notices were given to the persons responsible for the conduct of the houses, with the result of causing a discontinuance of the annoyance and thereby rendering legal proceedings unnecessary. The Vestry desire it to be understood that they are prepared to take legal proceedings against keepers of disorderly houses, on complaint being made to them, and on two ratepayers undertaking to produce material evidence sufficient to justify a prosecution. PROPOSED REGISTRATION OF CLUBS. The Vestry's attention was called early in the year to the desirability of some steps being taken for the registration and supervision of clubs, many of which cause great 94 annoyance to the surrounding neighbourhood, by the following resolution, which was passed by the Vestry of St. Anne, Westminster:— That this Vestry do petition Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Home Department to bring in a Bill to compel the registration of all Clubs, and to make it impossible for any private individual to open premises for the sale of excisable articles for his own profit without any real restriction as to condition of membership—(1) to the great annoyance of the respectable residents in the neighbourhood, owing to the late hours kept, and the frequent disturbances arising from the conduct of persons frequenting the same; (2) to the great cost to the ratepayers of the frequent prosecutions which become necessary in the interests of public order; and (3) to the injury of licensed persons who pay heavy license duties for the sale of such articles, and under statutory provisions and the supervision of the Police. A very large number of clubs, many of which are of a questionable character, abound in the neighbourhood of St. James's and St. Anne's, and the Vestry unhesitatingly concurred in the views expressed by the Vestry of St. Anne, Westminster, and addressed a communication to the Home Secretary in support thereof. There does not appear to be much chance of any action being taken by the Government with regard to these places unless public opinion expresses itself more forcibly in the matter. DRINKING FOUNTAINS. There were at Lady-day three Drinking Fountains in this Parish, one of which is the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain at Piccadilly Circus, and the other two are situate in the Churchyard wall in Piccadilly. These Fountains were erected and are maintained without cost to the Vestry. 95 LAVATORIES AND SANITARY CONVENIENCES, PICCADILLY CIRCUS. During the twelve months ended at Lady-day, the men's closets have been used by 234,746 persons, the ladies' conveniences by 253,512, the men's lavatory by 45,790, and the ladies' lavatory by 5,024. No record is kept of the use of the urinals, for which no charge is made, but they were resorted to by a very large number of persons during the year and prove every year that they supply a much needed want in the neighbourhood. It will be seen on reference to the accounts (page 134, that the fees received during the year for the use of the lavatories and conveniences amounted to £2,458, and the outgoings for working expenses to £1,384 1s. 8d. To the outgoings, however, must be added a proportion of the establishment expenses for supervision and management. UNDERGROUND CONVENIENCES—GREAT MARLBOROUGH STREET. The Vestry having last year decided to construct underground Conveniences and Lavatories for both sexes in Great Marlborough Street, tenders were invited for the work, and the lowest one received, viz, that of Messrs. Finch & Co., offering to construct the Conveniences in accordance with the drawings and specification for the sum of £1,345, was, after some delay, ultimately accepted. The Conveniences have been completed to the satisfaction of the Vestry, and were opened to the public on the 22nd February, 1897. A sufficient time has not elapsed to give details as to the extent to which the Conveniences are used. 06 URINALS. The following is a list of public urinals (in addition to the Piccadilly and Gt. Marlborough Street conveniences above referred to) erected and maintained by the Vestry :— Situation. No. of Compartments. Situation. No. of Compartments.

This property continues to be well let although necessarily there have been several changes of tenants during the year. A copy of the accounts of the Trust funds will be found on pages 153 and 154. As enquiries are frequently made as to the origin and cost of these dwellings, the following copy of the statement deposited in the cavity of the foundation stone is here reprinted for the information of the Parishioners:— The funds for the erection of this Building were mainly derived from the sale of the Burial Ground situate in Hampstead Road, and formerly belonging to the Parish of St. James, Westminster. The sale was effected under the provisions of a Special Act of Parliament obtained by the London and North-Western Railway Company in the year 1883. The Company sought power to acquire, on payment of £15,000, so much of the Burial Ground as had not been disposed of under the St. James's Chapel Act, 1869. The Company were, however, restricted by Parliament from taking the whole of the ground for the purposes of their undertaking, and the Trustees of the Burial Ground were required by the Act of 1883 to convey a specified portion to the Company for the sum of £8,000, and the remainder of the ground without further consideration to the Vestry of St. Pancras (within which Parish the Burial Ground was situate) to be by them preserved as an open space, The purchase money was 101 directed by the Act to be applied to such ecclesiastical, parochial and other purposes for the benefit of the Parish of St. James as the Trustees, with the sanction of the Vestry, might direct. The money was paid into court by the Railway Company and the Burial Ground conveyed as to a portion thereof to the Company and as to the remainder to the Vestry of St. Pan eras. After mature deliberation, the Trustees decided to apply one equal moiety of the fund to ecclesiastical purposes, and the other moiety to secular purposes for the benefit of the Parish, and the Vestry sanctioned this mode of applying the money The moiety applicable to ecclesiastical purposes having been paid over to the Rector and Churchwardens upon certain definite trusts, it became necessary to decide upon the particular secular purpose to which the remainder of the money should be devoted, and after having considered several proposals, the Trustees with the sanction of the Vestry, decided to apply the same, amounting to about £4,000, to the erection of a building for the accommodation of the labouring poor. This fund was supplemented by the assignment of a leasehold house known as No. 7, Ingestrs Place, which had been erected by voluntary effort in or about the year 1850, as a model lodging house, and a sum of about £2,000 being accumulated surplus rents derived therefrom, also by the transfer of a farther sum of nearly £80 being the unapplied balance of a fund raised for the relief of sufferers by a fire which occurred in Little Windmill Street in the year 1876, and by the transfer of a sum of £200, a portion of the funds remaining in the hands of the Trustees at the closing of the Trust in July, 1886, under the provisions of the London and North-Western Railway Act, 1884. The total sum thus available for the building is nearly £6,300. The building is erected by the authority of an Order of the High Court of Justice (Chancery Division) made by Mr. Justice Pearson on the 3rd day of August, 1885, the scheme being set forth therein as follows 1. The funds are to be applied by the Vestry of the Parish of St. James, Westminster (hereinafter called the Vestry) in or towards the erection and fitting up on the land comprised in the agreement dated the 18th May, 1885, and made between Sir Richard Francis Sutton of the first part and the Vestry of the Parish of St. James, Westminster, in the County of Middlesex, of the second part, of a lodging 102 house or lodging houses to be used together with the leasehold messuage and premises No. 7, Ingestre Place, for the accommodation at moderate rents of female pieceworkers and others of the labouring classes. 2. Such lodging house or lodging houses and the premises No. 7, Ingestre Place, are to be vested in the Vestry and to be under the control and management of the Vestry or a Committee appointed by them. A proper declaration or declarations of Trust of the premises comprised in the said Agreement for lease and of No. 7, Ingestre Place, shall be executed by the Vestry and enrolled pursuant to the Acts of 9 George 2nd, chapter 36, and 24 Victoria, chapter 9. 3. Any surplus income of the said properties after providing for repairs and other outgoings and expenses of management, shall be invested in the name or names of the Vestry or of Trustees to be appointed by the Vestry and applied in such manner as the Vestry with the approval of the Charity Commissioners for England and Wales or a court of competent jurisdiction shall hereafter determine, either in perpetuating and extending the operations of the scheme or for other purposes in or for the benefit of the said Parish. Plans were invited from the four undermentioned Architects, all of whom possess special knowledge of the requirements of Artisans Dwellings Mr. H. H. Collins, 61, Old Broad Street, E.C, Mr. H. M. Eyton, Ipswich. Mr. E. C. Robins, 14, John Street, Adelphi. Mr. Ernest Turner, 246, Regent Street. No premium was offered, but a stipulation was made that if either design was adopted by the Vestry, the author thereof should be appointed Architect at the usual rate of remuneration. Each of the Architects named sent in a set of drawings, and the Vestry were assisted in their choice by Mr. John Thos. Wimperis, of 25, Sackville Street, and Mr. D. Cubitb Nicholls, of 3, Howard Street, Strand, who generously actcd as honorary professional 103 advisers. These gentlemen reported in favour of the design of Mr. H. H. Collins, and this report was approved by the Special Committee appointed to consider the matter and unanimously adopted by the Vestry. Mr. H. H. Collins was accordingly appointed Architect, and tenders for the erection of the building upon quantities taken out by Messrs. Gardiner, Son, & Theobald, of 110, Great Russell Street, were invited from seventeen firms of builders, each of whom sent in a tender. Certain modifications were subsequently made in the quantities, and the tender of Mr. Mark Gentry, of 2, Wormwood Street, in the City of London, to carry out the work on the revised quantities for the sum of £5,573 was accepted. The land upon which the building is to be erected is held on lease from Sir Richard Francis Sutton, Bart., for the term of 63 years from the 24th June, 1885, at a grouud rent of £50 per annum ; the original ground rent of £75 having been reduced by Sir R. F. Sutton in consideration of the object for which the building was to be erected. The building is designed to comprise 23 single room tenements, 12 two-room tenements, two rooms for the caretaker, and a general wash-house and work-room. The work is commenced in the hope that it will benefit the poorer of the labouring classes in the parish, to an ever increasing extent, as the surplus rents admit of an extension of the operations of the Trust.

LONDON COUNTY BUILDINGS BILL. The Vestry's attention was called to this Bill, by which power was sought to authorise the London County Council to purchase and take land at Charing Cross for the purpose of erecting larger and properly designed buildings and offices (the cost of the lands being estimated at £851,000), and the Vestry passed a resolution expressing an opinion that it would be injudicious to commit the ratepayers to the extent proposed by the Bill, having regard to the probability of legislation affecting London Local Government in the near future. BROMPTON AND PICCADILLY CIRCUS RAILWAY BILL. This Bill received the careful consideration of the Vestry. The Bill proposed to authorise the construction of an Underground Electric Railway from Air Street, Piccadilly, to South Kensington. The Scheme included in the limits of deviation the whole of the carriageways of Piccadilly. It was proposed under the Bill to construct a station and 106 subway fit Air Street, and at this point the limits of deviation include the footways and one house in Piccadilly (Cording's). The footways and carriageways of Air Street, as far as the north side of No. 3, Air Street, and Nos. 1, 2 & 3, Air Street. The residents and ratepayers in Piccadilly and the vicinity presented a petition to the Vestry asking them to oppose the scheme on general grounds, and having regard to this Memorial and to the desirability of obtaining the insertion of certain clauses safeguarding the interests of the parishioners and protecting the property of the Parish, and requiring the insertion of a clause compelling the Company to pay rates on property taken by them on the existing rateable value, until such time as the undertaking of the Company shall be brought into rating, the Vestry decided to present a petition against the Bill and oppose the same by Counsel. The Vestry, in common with other authorities, accordingly opposed the Bill, by Counsel, before the Committee of the House of Commons, to which it was referred, but the Committee found the preamble of the Bill proved. CITY AND WEST END RAILWAY BILL. This Bill also received the attention of the Vestry, the proposal being to construct an underground railway from Hammersmith to the City of London, passing under the carriageways of Piccadilly and Coventry Street in this Parish. The scheme took in the limits of deviation the whole of the carriageways of those thoroughfares, and it was proposed to construct a station at Lemon Tree Yard, the property proposed to be acquired extending from the Criterion to the East side of the Haymarket, exclusive of footway, and from Piccadilly to Jermyn Street, including 107 underneath the carriageways of both streets. It was proposed to construct this line below the proposed Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway, although the vertical limits of deviation would allow the two to clash. The ratepayers and residents in Piccadilly and the vicinity presented a similar memorial to the Vestry as in the case of the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway Bill, urging the Vestry to oppose the scheme. The Vestry decided, however, not to oppose the preamble of this Bill, but simply to petition against the Bill, with a view to obtaining the insertion of general and specific clauses safeguarding the interests of the parishioners and protecting the property of the Parish. This Bill was referred to the same Committee in the House of Commons as that to which the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway Bill was relegated, and in this case the Committee found the preamble not proved. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL WATER BILLS. The Vestry having had under consideration the various Parliamentary Bills promoted by the London County Council for the transfer to the Council of the undertakings of the several Water Companies supplying the Metropolis, passed the following resolutions with respect thereto:— 1. That the said Bills are unsatisfactory, inasmuch as they are calculated to commit the Ratepayers of London to unknown liabilities, the probable financial effect of the transfer being at present obscure, and no provision is made for amalgamating the undertakings or unifying the rates or methods of charge. 2. That, assuming it is conceded that the water supply should be in the hands of a public body, and that the only question to settle is how could this principle be applied to London, the best and most satisfactory method of determining the question would be the appointment of a Royal Commission, 108 somewhat on the linen of the "Unification" Commission, to inquire whether there should be for " Water London " more than one public authority, how such authority or authorities should be constituted, the area of each, on what principles purchase should be carried out, to what extent and in what manner it may be desirable to provide for the unifying of the charges which at present vary considerably, and into any other points which may be found necessary; and recommending accordingly; and that a copy of these resolutions be forwarded to the Government, the London Members of Parliament, the London County Council, and the Rating Authoritics of the Metropolis. LOCAL AUTHORITIES (OFFICERS') SUPERANNUATION BILL. This Bill, which proposed to extend the provisions of the Poor Law Officers' Superannuation Act, 1896, to the officers and servants in the service of Local Authorities in England and Wales, was carefully considered by the Parliamentary Bills Committee, who reported to the Vestry that while approving the principle of the Bill, they were of opinion that the details of the same were unsatisfactory in certain respects, and recommended that a Petition be presented to Parliament to amend the Bill. The Vestry, however, in considering the subject, decided to present a petition against the Bill on general grounds. SUMMONSES UNDER ELEMENTARY EDUCATION ACTS. A communication was received from the School Board for London in the fall of last year, forwarding copy of a memorial which they had presented to the Secretary of State for the Home Department as to the desirability of summonses under the Elementary Education Acts, &c., being heard by Justices of the Peace, and asking for this 109 Vestry's cooperation in the matter. The Vestry, after considering the matter, expressed the opinion that all summonses issued under the Elementary Education Acts, Public Health Acts, Metropolis Management Acts, Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, the Acts administered by the London County Council and other kindred Statutes should be heard by Justices in Petty Sessions. The School Board was accordingly informed that the Vestry concurred in the views expressed in the said memorial, and a similar memorial was addressed from this Vestry to the Home Secretary in support thereof. PROPOSED BYE-LAWS RE HOUSE DRAINAGE. The London County Council, in the early part of this year, forwarded a series of Bye-laws which they proposed to make under the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, for regulating the dimensions, form and mode of construction, o o J and the keeping, cleansing and repairing of the pipes, drains and other means of communicating with sewers, and the traps and apparatus connected therewith, and invited suggestions from the Vestry thereon. The Medical Officer of Health and Surveyor submitted a report pointing out— (a) That portions of the proposed Bye-laws were prolix and obscurely worded. (b) That some of the provisions were ambiguous and telligible. (c) That some of the requirements Avere unnecessary and oppressive. (d) That on some points the requirements were inadequate. and made numerous suggestions as to the manner in which the Bye-laws could with advantage be altered or improved. 110 The Vestry adopted the report and ordered a copy to be forwarded to the London County Council, Local Government Board, Home Secretary, and the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis. The Council have not yet issued the revised Bye-laws, and it is not known therefore to what extent the representations made by the several Local Authorities have been adopted. OMNIBUS TRAFFIC. In consequence of the obstruction and congestion of traffic caused by the omnibuses at Piccadilly Circus, a communication was addressed to the Superintendent of Police, asking if the Police have authority, under the existing powers vested in them, to divert any portion of the omnibus traffic passing through the public thoroughfares. The Superintendent replied that the Police had no power to make regulations or interfere with the route of omnibuses on ordinary occasions, but that they would still continue to do their best to minimise, as far as their power would permit, the inconvenience arising from the congested condition of the traffic in the district alluded to. CARNABY STREET.—ALTERATION OF PASSAGEWAY. In December last a communication was received from the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company, intimating that they wished to make a small extension to their Central Station in Carnaby Street, and for this purpose desired to alter the narrow passage which passed through the Company's premises and leads from Carnaby Street to Marlborough Row. To effect this the Company proposed to construct a new passageway, 6 feet wide, in a 111 different position, in lieu of the old one which measured 4 feet 6 inches wide, but in other respects there would be no alteration. The Vestry decided to offer 110 objection to the passageway being altered as suggested, subject to any other necessary consents being obtained, and on condition that the new passageway was made 10 feet wide in lieu of 6 as proposed, and that it was open to the sky. BEAK STREET IMPROVEMENT. An improvement has been effected in Beak Street by widening the carriageway between Warwick Street and Regent Street, and thereby facilitating vehicular traffic in that thoroughfare. COMMEMORATION OF LONG REIGN OF HER MAJESTY, QUEEN VICTORIA. Just prior to Lady-day it was referred to a Special Committee of the whole Vestry to consider what action it might be desirable to take with a view of commemorating the long reign of Her Majesty the Queen. As no definite conclusions had been arrived at before the close of this Report, the matter will be dealt with in the Vestry's Report for next year. ROUTE OF ROYAL PROCESSION. The Vestry, on learning that the Royal Procession would not, on the 22nd June, proceed along that portion of Piccadilly between St. James's Street and Piccadilly Circus, forwarded a Memorial to the Committee having the control of the matter, praying that the route might be altered, so that the procession might proceed, either on the outward or return journey, along the above-mentioned portion of Piccadilly. The Committee replied that they were unable to recommend Her Majesty to make any alteration in the route as published, 112 STATE AID TO VOLUNTARY SCHOOLS. The Vestry's attention having been called to the proposals of the Government in the latter part of the year with regard to the contemplated grant from the Rates or Taxes to Denominational Schools, passed the following resolutions on the subject:— (a) That this Vestry, understanding that the Government template making a grant to the Denominational Schools, is of most emphatic opinion that such grant should come out of the Imperial Taxes, without further burdening the already heavily-rated householders by making such grant a charge on the Rates. (b) That a copy of the foregoing resolution be forwarded to Her Majesty's Government, the Bishops of London ar.d Peterborough, the Right Rev. Bishop Barry, Rector of St. James's, the metropolitan Members of Parliament, and the Rating Authorities of the Metropolis. CONFERENCES. The only Conference, in addition to the one convened by this Vestry on the subject of Disorderly Houses, to which delegates were sent during the year was that convened by the Vestry of St. Pancras on the subject of the Vaccination Acts. The delegates appointed were — Dr. Axham, and Messrs. J. E. Bennett, R. C. Hill, and G. Angold. CONCLUDING REMARKS. The Vestry have not attempted in the foregoing Report to touch upon mere routine business requiring attention from day to day, or upon questions which are not deemed to be of general interest, but have endeavoured to submit to their fellow parishioners, in as clear and succinct a manner as possible, a statement of the principles which have guided them in the discharge of their trust, and particulars of the present condition of the Parish. By Order, T. HENSMAN MUNSEY, Vestry Clerk. 113 Supplemental Report of Works EXECUTED BY THE Vestry of Saint James, Westminster, FOR THE YEAR 1896 7.

An alteration was made to the footway of Ingestre Place, abutting on the Lion Brewery, to facilitate the passing of vehicles up and down the street during the loading of the brewer's drays. OLD MATERIALS. The quantities of old materials sold were 35 square feet of York stone paving, 51½ loads of wood, 420 yards of old pitching, 5 tons 8 cwt. 1 qr. of old iron, and 2 old scraping machines. WATER, &c., MAINS. During the year new mains have been laid in the streets or old ones replaced with new, as follows:— By the Grand Junction Waterworks Company: In Charles Street and Marshall Street. By the London Hydraulic Power Company: In Beak Street, Great Windmill Street, Lower Regent Street, New Burlington Street, St. James's Place and Waterloo Place. By the Gas Light and Coke Company: In Piccadilly Circus and Charles Street. By the National Telephone Company: In Piccadilly. 120 ELECTRIC LIGHT CONDUCTORS. Electric Light Conductors have been laid in portions of the following streets, viz.:— By the London Electric Supply Corporation: In Great Windmill Street and St. James's Place. By the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company: In Argyll Place, Berwick Street, Brewer Street, Broad Street, Carnaby Street, Chapel Court, Charles Street, Coventry Street, Eagle Place, Foubert's Place, Ganton Street, Glasshouse Street, Great Pulteney Street, Jermyn Street, King Street, Little Pulteney Street, Lower Regent Street, Marshall-Street, Mason's Yard, Ormond Yard, Pall Mall, Peter Street. Piccadilly, Piccadilly Circus, Regent Street, Rupert Street, Ryder Street, St. James's Square, St. James's Street, Shaftesbury Avenue, Vigo Street, Wardour Street, Waterloo Place and York Street. In October last a burst occurred in one of the water mains in Piccadilly, opposite St. James's Street. The water escaping from the burst main travelled down St. James's Street under the wood paving as far as Little St. James's Street, where it found its way into the electric light conduits of the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company, thereby nearly extinguishing the electric light in the houses in the neighbourhood for a considerable time. LICENSES Have been granted for the erection of 95 hoardings and scaffolds for the purposes of re-building, alterations, &c. License has also been given in 43 cases to open the roadway to repair water pipes, or for similar purposes. The cost of making good these openings is charged to the persons taking out the Licenses. 121 COAL PLATES. During the past twelve months 47 coal plates were cut into the paving. REFUGES. Additional refuges have been formed, viz.:—1 in Broad Street, between Poland Street and Lexington Street, and 1 in Great Marlborough Street, by Poland Street. Each refuge is lighted with a Sugg's " Lambeth" lamp of 80 candle power. Refuges were also being constructed round the new electric light columns in the main thoroughfares, but were not completed at the 25th March. PICCADILLY CIRCUS. The stone pitching with which the carriageway of Piccadilly Circus was paved and which had been in use some 12 years, being quite worn out, was replaced with new stone with a bituminous joint, after the close of the London season. BEAK STREET. The carriageway at the entrance to Beak Street from Regent Street, which was previously somewhat cramped, has been widened to admit of a freer passage of vehicles. SANITARY SHELTER. Two rooms at the Sanitary Shelter have been fitted up respectively as a Receiving Room and Bath Room, for the use of persons arriving from apartments: in which there have been cases of infectious disease, so that they may temporarily occupy the Shelter during the time their own apartments are being disinfected. 12-2 STONEYARD. To ensure the efficient disinfection of clothing, &c., after cases of infectious disease, and to prevent all chance of the disinfected clothing coming in contact with clothing awaiting disinfection, your Vestry decided to remove the old steam disinfector and replace it with a new one so arranged that the clothes before treatment were placed in the machine at one end, and after treatment removed at the other end. To further prevent contamination, the disinfecting chamber was divided in two by means of a brick wall, which also crossed the disinfecting apparatus between the inlet and outlet doors, and the walls of the chamber were covered with opalite by the National Glazed Brick and Tile Syndicate, of 71, Bishopsgate Street Within. LIGHTING. The maintenance and painting of the ordinary street lanterns and lamp columns, which were formerly done by the Gas Company are now carried out for the Vestry by contract. The contractors for the year till Christmas were Messrs. R. and J. Shiers, of 5, King Street, Regent Street, W. The contractors for the refuge and special street lamps and lamp columns till Christmas were Messrs. Wm. Sugg and Co., of Vincent Works, Regency Street, Westminster, SWSince Christmas the whole of the work has been carried out by Messrs. S. Pontifex and Co., of 22, Coleman Street, E.C. " The refuge lamps are furnished with a " midnight arrangement," and a man is employed by your Vestry to light, extinguish, and clean these lamps and those in the urinals, and also to reduce the light at 12 o'clock at night. The cost of new lamps, alterations, repairs, maintenance, painting, &c., has been £323 3s. 5d. 123 Your Vestry having decided to adopt the electric light for lighting the main streets of the Parish, referred the matter to your Works Committee to carry out. Various contracts were entered into and the necessary work proceeded with, but it was not complete on the 25th March. SEWERS. The cost of the general repairs to sewers and gullies, and cleansing sewers by men in the employ of your Vestry, was as follows:— £ s. d. Argyll Street 48 9 3 Beak Street 1 7 0 Berwick Street 1 8 8 Brewer Street 5 8 7 Broad Street 2 18 10 Bury Street 4 1 4 Carnaby Street 3 16 0 Charles Street 0 14 4 Coventry Street 1 19 6 Denman Street 2 1 1 Dufour's Place 0 9 2 Duke Street 1 19 10 Glasshouse Street 4 6 10 Golden Square 9 3 7 Great Marlborough Street 2 6 11 Great Pulteney Street 2 0 4 Great Windmill Street 2 1 7 Heddon Street 3 10 1 Jermyn Street 5 13 1 King Street (Golden Square) 3 6 5 King Street (St. James's) 3 18 10 Lexington Street 8 19 1 Marshall Street 123 2 1 Carried forward 243 2 5 124  £ s. d.

Several of the small brick barrel sewers running through the vaults of the houses in Regent Street, being in a very defective state, were replaced with pipes. The accumulations removed from the sewers and gullies were carted away by the slopping contractors under their contract, without extra expense to the Vestry. 125 CONNECTIONS TO SEWERS. Seventy new connections from houses have been made to the sewers by men in the employ of your Vestry. EXAMINING OUTLETS TO DRAINS. Examinations of outlets of drains have been made in 12 cases. The fee for examination is five shillings. FLUSHING. The small sewers and courts were flushed at intervals during the hot weather as found necessary. The cost of water was £84 4s. 3d.; labour, £49 2s. 7d. DISINFECTING. The gullies and market streets were regularly disinfected during the summer months. The disinfectants used for all purposes amounted to 2,270½ gallons of sanitary fluid, costing £227 1s. URINALS. All the Urinals in the Parish are fitted up on the trough system, and flushed automatically. Excluding the Lavatories at Piccadilly Circus and Great Marlborough Street, the water has cost £129 2s. 10d. A constant supply of water is laid on to all the Urinals in the Parish. The cost of alterations and repairs have been £72 13s. 1d., and cleansing £79 4s. 11d. The repairs were principaly making good wilful damage caused by persons unknown, laying a new iron drain to Cork Street Mews Urinal, and providing and fixing a new slate screen to Ham Yard Urinal. 126 PICCADILLY LAVATORIES. The cost of general repairs and contracts for alterations, &c., to the Lavatories was £534 9s. 6d.; gas, including that consumed in the large lamps outside, £86 8s. 10d.; water, £205 1s. 6d.; and electric light, £40 6s. 6d. As the L'Incrusta Walton with which the ceilings were covered was constantly becoming detached in places and hanging down, and as the ceilings never looked clean and tidy your Vestry decided to remove the L'Incrusta Walton entirely and replace it with opal glass formed into panels, and held in position by moulded wooden ribs, and also to cover the fascias under the pavement lights with " Opalite " tiling. Advantage was likewise taken of the slack season to repaint the building and substitute the Electric Light for Gas. The Contract for the ceilings was carried out by Mr. C. W. Knight, of 14 and 15, Marlborough Mews, Oxford Street, for the painting by Messrs. R. & J. Shiers, of 5, King Street, Recent Street, and for the electric light fittings by Messrs. Freeman & Co., of 21, Swallow Street, Piccadilly. GREAT MARLBOROUGH STREET LAVATORIES. Your Vestry being constantly in receipt of complaints from the inhabitants of nuisances committed in the neigh- bourhood of Great Marlborough Street, decided to construct Underground Lavatories in that thoroughfare opposite the Police Court to abate the nuisances complained of. Your Vestry accordingly gave me instructions to prepare the necessary plans and specification and obtain Tenders for carrying out the work. Tenders were subsequently received from Messrs. John Bolding & Sons, Mr. George Jennings, Messrs. H. Doulton & Co., and Messrs. B. Finch & Co. The lowest tender that of Messrs. B. Finch & Co., 127 was accepted and the work carried out. The Lavatories were opened to the Public in February last. The accommodation provided for men is (J urinals, 3 water-closets and 2 lavatory basins; and for women 3 water-closets and 2 lavatory basins. There are also cabins for the attendants. SNOW STORMS. Three Snow Storms occurred during the Winter, viz., on the night of the 16th and 17th January, on the 22nd January, and 23rd January. One inch of snow fell on the first occasion and two inches on both the second and third occasions. In each case the snow was all removed within about 24 hours of its falling. One day's work was given to 490 odd men. The total cost of removal was £275. MACHINE BROOMS, &c. The machine brooms required refilling with new bass on the average once in six weeks. The cost of refilling the machine brooms, and new hand brooms and brushes for Orderly Boys, and repairs to the machine brooms, amounted to the sum of £123 5s. WATERING. The street watering throughout the year was carried out by Messrs. William Mead & Co., of Paddington, at a schedule of prices. The water is supplied by the Grand Junction Water Works Company by contract. The cost of team labour, &c., was £1,238 11s. 1d., and water, £401 16s. 5d. STAND POSTS. Two additional stand posts have been erected, viz., one in Waterloo Place and one in Dufour's Place. 128 The cost of repairs to stand posts and swan necks, repacking, &c., and providing and fixing the two stand posts above-mentioned, and replacing existing broken stand posts with new, has amounted to £67 1s. 6d.

Table of Articles 229 TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS of the Vestry of Saint James's Westminister Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report, for the year 1896, upon the Public Health of the Parish of St. James's, Westminster. This Report is the twenty-third which I have had the honour to prepaid for the parish of St. James's. Eighteen Annual Reports had previously been prepared by Dr. Edwin Lankester, my predecessor in this office. During the year 1896, upon the appointment of a new Sanitary Inspector, the Vestry took occasion to "re-appoint" the present senior Sanitary Inspector and also the Medical Officer of Health under the General Order of the Local Government Board (March 28th, 1889). The Medical Officer of Health and the Sanitary Inspectors of St. James's are now governed by the general provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and by the General Order of the Local Government Board (8th December, 1891). Half the salaries of these officers will be paid by the London County Council, while the officers come more directly under the control of the Local Government Board, and the duties of the Medical Officer of Health are extended and more precisely prescribed. Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, section 108, the Local Government Board has:— "(1) The same powers as they have in the case of a district medical officer of a poor law union with regard to the qualification, appointment, duties, salary, and tenure of office of every medical officer of health and sanitary inspector, and one-half of the salary of every such medical officer of health and sanitary inspector shall be paid by the County Council' 182 "(b) A medical officer of health shall be removable by the sanitary authority with the consent of the Local Government Board, or by that Board, and not otherwise." Provision (b) does not extend to limiting the discretion of the Vestry with regard to the removal of its Sanitary Inspectors. Under article 10 of the General Order of the Local Government Board (8th December, 1891), the Sanitary Inspectors of St. James's are removable at the discretion of the Vestry without reference to the Local Government Board. But in section 108 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the qualifications of the Sanitary Inspectors are prescribed by a new provision (d); and this provision prevents the appointment of unqualified persons as sanitary inspectors. The terms of this provision are as follows:— "(d) A sanitary inspector appointed after January 1st, 1895, shall be holder of a certificate of such body as the Local Government Board may from time to time approve, that he has by examination shown himself competent for such office, or shall have been, during three consecutive years preceding the year 1895, a sanitary inspector or inspector of nuisances of a district in London, or of an urban sanitary district out of London containing, according to the last published census, a population of not less than 20,000 inhabitants." In some districts it has been found necessary to protect medical officers of health and sanitary inspectors from arbitrary dismissal consequent upon a fearless discharge of their important public duties. I may, therefore, perhaps be permitted to put upon record the fact that I have always received the cordial support of the Vestry in the discharge of these duties for the parish of St. James's. It is true that, in the course of 24 years of office, I have been brought into conflict with one or two individual members of the Vestry who did not realise that they were bound to be exemplary in the management of tenement houses owned by themselves in the district which they publicly represented. But in these cases I invariably received such encouragement from the Vestry as to enable me to act as strenuously as with less distinguished delinquents. This support has been invaluable. 183 Large changes in the form of the Annual Report will henceforth be required. This Report is, therefore, the first of a new series, and it will be my duty and my endeavour to develop the Annual Reports in the sense indicated so well by the memorandum drafted by the Medical Officer of the Local Government Board, under date December, 1896; a memorandum designed for the guidance of Medical Officers of Health, and for the promotion of uniformity with regard to the matter and the form of their Reports. The duties charged upon your Medical Officer of Health are now also varied and extended by Article 18 of the Order of the Local Government Board (8th December, 1891), while the duties of your Sanitary Inspectors are defined in Article 19 of the same Order. It will be of interest to the members of the Vestry to fully realise the changes which will have come about in the Annual Reports, and in the scope and character of the duties to be discharged by your Medical Officer of Health. In this first of the new series of Reports, a place may well be found for the admirable memorandum drafted by Dr. Thorne Thorne, and for the Article from the Order of the Local Government Board. Those documents are as follows:— London. Memorandum as to Annual Reports of Medical Officers of Health. Every Medical Officer of Health appointed under Order of the Local Government Board, is required to make an annual report with regard to the Sanitary District which is under his superintendence. This report is to be for the year ending the 31st of December, or, if the officer at that date has not been in office for a whole year, then for so much of the year as has elapsed since his appointment. The report is to be made to the Sanitary Authority, and the Medical Officer of Health himself should send a copy of it to the Local Government Board and to the London County Council. It should be made to the Sanitary Authority as soon as practicable after the expiration of the year to which it relates, and should be in the hands both of the Sanitary Authority and of the Local Government Board within, ??? most, five months from the end of the year. The Board's copy of the report should be forwarded to them when the original is sent to the Sanitary Authority, except where the report is likely to be printed by order of the Authority. In such cases the Board need only be supplied with a printed copy. 184 Article 18 (Section 15) of the Board's Order of 8th December, 1891, specifies the information to be .contained in the Annual Report. The report should be chiefly concerned with the conditions affecting health in the District, and with the means for improving those conditions. It should consider these subjects with reference to the past and future, as well as to the particular year, and the account of the sanitary state of the District generally should, while marking the point that has been reached in the sanitary state and administration of the District, indicate directions for further consideration and action. The sanitary history of the year under review should include a record alike of the proceedings of the Medical Officer of Health himself and of the proceedings taken under his direction or advice. The Medical Officer of Health, in reporting his proceedings and advice, may find it convenient to follow, in the main, the order in which the subject matters of his duty appear in the several paragraphs of Article 18. Special care should be taken to report fully and explicitly in reporting on the influences affecting or threatening to affect injuriously the public health within the District ; and the causes, origin, and distribution of disease within the District may usefully be the subjects of annual record. An account should also be given both of the actual circumstances of the District up to the end of the past year, and of any improvement or deterioration that has occurred during the year in conditions conducive to health or to disease. For example, a vigilant health officer has in his annual report an opportunity for pointing out any facts as to water supplies and house construction, conditions of storage and of removal of refuse customary in the district; together with any facts as to the adequacy or inadequacy of means of isolation and of disinfection, and the like. And such a Health Officer, reporting on the diseases and their causes within the district, will generally have some instructive details to give, either of conditions newly productive of disease, or of matters that have been remedied with advantage to the public health. In reporting upon section 3, not only should the fact of having made systematic inspections, but the outcome from those inspections should be duly put on record. The report should contain a full account of inspections, whether systematic or occasional, of the judgment which the Medical Officer of Health has formed thereon as to the sanitary state of his District, and of the advice he has in consequence given to the Sanitary Authority and the action taken by the Authority thereon. By "systematic" inspections is meant inspections independent of such inquiries as, under other articles of the Order, the Medical Officer of Health has to make into particular outbreaks of disease, or into unwholesome conditions to which his attention may have been specially called by complaints or otherwise, and such inspections will include the house-to-house inspections which may be necessary in particular localities. 185 In making systematic inspections, as in much of his other action, the Medical Officer of Health will usually have required the assistance of the Inspector of Nuisances; and it will be for the Medical Officer to include in his report an account of the action which, at his instance, the Inspector may have taken for the removal of nuisances injurious to health. The tabular statements of sickness and mortality in the District during the year, to be made on the forms supplied for the purpose, should be the subject of comment in the text of the report, in so far as deductions from them may assist the Sanitary Authority to an appreciation of the lines of action needful in the future. As regards these statements of sickness and mortality, only one other observation appears to be needful—the District under the superintendence of a Medical Officer of Health will often contain several parts evidently differing in their circumstances, or having very different rates of mortality, either from all causes, or of mortality from some particular disease or class of diseases. The observation of these differences can scarcely fail to lead to valuable information, and it is in view of such differences that the tabular statements are required in section 15 to be classified according to localities, and that provision for such a classification is made in the forms supplied for returns of deaths. In the absence of any ascertained differences of the above sort, it will still be desirable to classify the deaths of the district according to the part of the district in which they occur; and for this purpose any areas of known population may be taken as representing "localities" for the purposes of the Order. Classification on this basis will be likely to lead to the discovery of real differences when the returns for several years can be compared together. The same considerations apply to the records of sickness ( Table B.). These records should be tabulated for every sanitary district; and it will be well, before proceeding to fill the columns and the blank spaces, to note carefully the headings and the footnotes. What has been said above with regard to the information which an annual report should contain must be understood, not as suggesting that the report should be limited to these subjects, or that more detailed or differently arranged tabular statements may not be added, but as indicating the sort of information required by the Board's Order. Many Medical Officers of Health will doubtless, with great advantage to the administration of their districts, furnish much more detailed information respecting particular questions to which they have been led by the circumstances of the foregoing years to devote attention, or in the investigation of which they may have arrived at valuable conclusions. Any information of this kind will be appreciated by the Local Government Board. R. THORNE THORNE, Local Government Board, Medical Officer. December, 1896. 186 Article 18 of the Order of the Local Government Board :— The following shall he the duties of a Medical Officer of Health as regards the District or part of a District, for which he is appointed (in thin article referred to as "his District "):— (1.) He shall inform himself as far as practicable respecting all influences affecting or threatening to affect injuriously the public health within his District. (2.) He shall inquire into and ascertain by such means as are at his disposal the causes, origin, and distribution of diseases within his District, and ascertain to what extent the same have depended on conditions capable of removal or mitigation. (3.) He shall by inspection of his District, both systematically at certain periods, and at intervals as occasion may require, keep himself informed of the conditions injurious or dangerous to health existing therein. (4.) He shall be prepared to advise the Sanitary Authority on all matters affecting the health of his District, and on all sanitary points involved in the action of the Sanitary Authority; and in cases requiring it, he shall certify, for the guidance of the Sanitary Authority or of the Justices, as to any matter in respect of which the Certificate of a Medical Officer of Health or a Mcdical Practitioner is required as the basis or in aid of sanitary action. (5.) He shall advise the Sanitary Authority on any question relating to health involved in the framing and subsequent working of such bye-laws and regulations as they may have power to make. (6.) On receiving information of the outbreak of any dangerous infectious disease within his District, he shall visit without delay the spot where the outbreak has occurred, and inquire into the causes and circumstances of such outbreak, and in case he is not satisfied that all due precautions are being taken, he shall advise the persons competent to act as to the measures which may appear to him to be required to prevent the extension of the disease, and shall take such measures for the prevention of disease as he is legally authorised to take under any Statute in force in the District or by any resolution of the Sanitary Authority. (7.) Subject to the instructions of the Sanitary Authority, he shall direct or superintend the work of the Sanitary Inspector or Sanitary Inspectors in the way and to the extent that the Sanitary Authority shall approve, and on receiving information 187 from any Sanitary Inspector that his intervention is required in connection with any nuisance, he shall, as early as practicable, take such steps as he is legally authorised to take under any Statute in force in the District, or by any resolution of the Sanitary Authority, as the circumstances of the case may justify and require. (8.) In any case in which it may appear to him to be necessary or advisable, or in which he shall be so directed by the Sanitary Authority, he shall himself inspect and examine any animal intended for the food of man which is exposed for sale or deposited in any place for the purpose of sale or of preparation for sale, and any article, whether solid or liquid, intended for the food of man, and sold or exposed for sale, or deposited in any place for the purpose of sale or of preparation for sale. If such animal or article appears to him to be diseased, or unsound, or unwholesome, or unfit for the food of man, he shall seize and carry away the same himself or by an assistant in order to have the same dealt with by a Justice according to the provisions of Section 47 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. (9.) He shall perform all the duties imposed upon him by any byelaws and regulations of the Sanitary Authority, duly continued where confirmation is legally required, in respect of any matter affecting the public health, and touching which the Sanitary Authority are authorised to frame bye-laws and regulations. (10.) He shall inquire into any offensive process of trade carried on within his District, and report on the appropriate means for the prevention of any nuisance or injury to health therefrom. (11.) He shall from time to time inspect any Bakehouses which arc Workshops, and are situate within his District, and he shall thereupon report to the Sanitary Authority whether any steps are necessary to be taken for the purpose of enforcing, as respects such Bakehouses, the provisions of Sections 34, 35, and 81, of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, and Sections 15 and 16 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1883. (12.) He shall attend at the office of the Sanitary Authority or an some other appointed place, at such stated times as they may direct. (13.) He shall from time to time report in writing to the Sanitary Authority his proceedings and the measures which may require to be adopted for the improvement or protection of the public health in his District. He shall in like manner report with respect to the sickness occurring within his District, and the mortality thereof, so far as he is able to ascertain the same. 188 (14.) He shall keep a book or books, to be provided by the Sanitary Authority, in which he shall make an entry of his visits, and notes of his observations and instructions thereon, and also the date and nature of applications made to him, the date and result of the action taken thereon, and of any action taken on previous reports; and shall produce such book or books, whenever required, to the Sanitary Authority. (15.) He shall also make an annual report to the Sanitary Authority, up to the Thirty-first day of December in each year, comprising a summary of the action taken, or which he has advised the Sanitary Authority to take, during the year for preventing the spread of disease, and an account of the sanitary state of his District generally, at the end of the year. The report shall also contain an account of the inspections and inquiries which he has made as to conditions injurious or dangerous to health existing in his District, and of the proceedings in which he has taken part or advised under any Statute, so far as such proceedings relate to those conditions; and also an account of the supervision exercised by him, or on his advice, for sanitary purposes over places and houses that the Sanitary Authority have power to regulate, with the nature and results of any proceedings which may have been so required and taken in respect of the same during the year. The report shall also record the action taken by him, or on his advice, during the year, in regard to offensive trades, to factories and workshops, and to dairies. The report shall also contain tabular statements (on Forms to be supplied by us, or to the like effect) of the sickness and mortality within his District, classified according to diseases, ages, and localities : Provided that, if the Medical Officer of Health shall resign or be removed before the Thirty-first day of December in any year, he shall thereupon make the like report for that part of of the year during which he has held office. (16.) He shall give immediate information to Us of any outbreak of dangerous epidemic disease within his District. He shail transmit to Us a copy of each annual report and of any special report made by him. On his advising the Sanitary Authority with a view to their requiring the closure of any school or schools, in pursuance of the Code of Regulations approved by the Education Department and for the time being in force, he shall forthwith report specially to Us the grounds of his advice (17.) At the same time that he gives information to Us of an outbreak of dangerous epidemic disease, or transmits to Us a copy of his annual report or of any special report, he shall give the like information or transmit a copy of such report to the London County Council. (18.) In all matters not specifically provided for in this Order, he shall observe and execute any instructions issued by Us, and the 189 lawful orders and directions of the Sanitary Authority applicable to his office. (19.) Whenever We shall make regulations for all or any of the purposes specified in Section 134 of the Public Health Act, 1875, as extended to London by Section 113 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and shall declare the regulations so made to be in force within his District or any part thereof, he shall observe such regulations, so far as the same relate to or concern his office. The two new tables prescribed by Section 15 of Article 18 of the Order of the Local Government Board will be found (marked A. and B.) at pages 38 to 41. In filling up these new tables, I have given my best attention to the annotations endorsed upon the model forms. In Table A the nineteenth column is left blank as to its heading in the model form, in order that each Medical Officer of Health may, at his discretion, insert any cases which he may think should be added. I have exercised the discretion thus vested in me, by inserting the deaths from " Cancer" which have occurred in my district. Further particulars which I should have desired to add are shown in other tables which continue, as to matter and form, the series of Reports hitherto published for St. James's. Two extra columns might well be devoted to the tabulation of "Malignant Growths" and "Tuberculous Diseases," but for this a greater precision than obtains at present is needed in the certificates as to the causes of death. The area and population, to which this Report relates, have been shown each year in my previous Reports. These data are now summarized in the following table:— Area in Acres 162 Population. Mean Density of Population per Acre. Census, 1831 37,053 229 ,, 1841 37,398 231 ,, 1851 36.406 225 ,, 1861 35,326 218 ,, 1871 33,619 214 ,, 1881 29,865 184 ,, 1891 24,995 154 ,, 1896 23,050 142 190 In Registration London the average density of the population for 1896 is given by the Registrar-General as 59.2 persons per acre. In Table B the headings of the model form require the population of the district to be given " as estimated to the middle of 1896." I know of no data by which an "estimate" could be arrived at for the district of St. James's. From the data set out above, it will be seen that the district of St. James's, while unaltered as to its area, has continuously diminished in population. This diminution is due to the great value of sites in St. James's, and to the pressure caused by the growth of splendid shops and wholesale warehouses. The development of suburban railways and omnibuses has made St. James's less and less a place of residence. There has been a continuous increase in the rateable value of the property represented by the Vestry, while there has been a continuous decrease in the number of the actually resident population. In calculating the death-rate of St. James's, there are special difficulties in drawing reliable inferences. St. James's is now largely occupied by high-class hotels and lodging-houses, in which a floating population of wealthy and fashionable visitors is found; while the population of servants, waiters, and other employes in the hotels, shops, and warehouses, is also largely floating. Many of the parishioners of St. James's reside in country houses, or sleep in the suburbs. It is, therefore, difficult to draw a sharp line of demarcation between those who " belong to " St. James's and those who do not. Again, some of those persons who are removed from St. James's and die in outlying institutions, are only more or less casually in St. James's when taken ill, and can scarcely be described as " belonging thereto." During the year 1896, the net mortality of the district of St. James's has been 396 deaths. Taking the population as enumerated in the census of 1896, we have 20,053 persons, with 396 deaths—a death-rate of 19.72 for each 1,000 persons sleeping in St. James's. 191 The figures for the net mortality of St. James's are obtained by taking the deaths registered in St. James's, adding to this number the deaths in outlying institutions of persons removed from St. James's, and then subtracting the deaths registered in St. -James's of persons who were noted as non-parishioners by the Registrar. This procedure is as follows :— 342 + 98 — 44 = 396 net mortality. These mortality data are shown in greater detail in the following figures. The deaths registered as having occurred in St. James's, for the four quarters of the year 1896, were as follows:— First Quarter 92 Second Quarter 87 Third Quarter 69 Fourth Quarter 94 Deaths registered in St. James's during the four quarters of the year 1896 342 Add deaths in outlying institutions among persons removed from St. James's 98 440 Deduct deaths of persons reported as NonParishioners : — Dying in the Union House 2-5 Dying in the Throat Hospital 17 Dying elsewhere 2 44 Net Mortality of St. James's for the year 1896 396 During the year 1896, 29 bodies were removed into the Mortuary. Fifteen inquests have been held upon bodies lying in the Mortuary, and 15 post-mortem examinations for judicial purposes have been made in the Examination Room adjoining the Mortuary. 192 The following Table gives a summary of the certified causes of death among persons dying in outlying institutions, after having been removed from the district of St. James's, Westminster, during the year 1896: — Accidental Injury 4 Aortic Disease 1 Apoplexy 3 Brain Disease 6 Bronchitis 4 Cancer 12 Congenital Debility 1 Convulsions 1 Diarrhoea 2 Drunkenness 1 Epilepsy 1 Erysipelas 1 Gastric Ulcer 2 Gastritis 1 Heart Disease 5 Kidney Disease 7 Measles 3 Meningitis 3 Mesenteric Disease 1 Paralysis (General), 2: Hemiplegia, 1 3 Peritonitis 1 Phthisis 18 Pneumonia 3 Premature Birth 1 Scarlet Fever 2 Senile Decay 4 Septicaemia 1 Spina Bifida 1 Spinal Caries 1 Strangulated Hernia 1 Tubercular Enteritis 1 Typhoid 2 98 193 The following Table shows the periods of life in which the deaths in St. James's have occurred in the last Seven years respectively.

Referring to the close of the year 1896, it has to be noted that the parish has been visited by no epidemic during the year. Mr. "William Hill Watson, the late Chief Sanitary Inspector, ceased to hold office during the year, and a new and valuable Sanitary Inspector has been chosen, Mr. T. W. Calverley. From Mr. Calverley, and from the senior Inspector, Mr. John Percy Folland, I have received cordial and efficient assistance in the sanitary work of the Parish. N 2 196 During the year the sanitary work of the Parish has been quietly and, in my opinion, efficiently done. The routine work as Medical Officer of Health has been done by me throughout the whole of the year. Special reference may be made to the fact that in connection with the election of a new Sanitary Inspector the Vestry have required an undertaking from their Medical Officer of Health and from each of their Sanitary Inspectors to the effect that no one of them shall deal in house property, or act as rent collectors, or as agents for the management of absentee property in the parish of St. James's. This is a regulation of. great importance, and one which might well be submitted to the Local Government Board as proper for the subject of a General Order. For an officer in whom the statutory powers and discretion of a Sanitary Inspector or Medical Officer of Health are vested to be allowed to grow rich by trading in tenement houses in his own district, would be to open the door to one of the worst forms of terrorism, corruption, and malfeasance. It is best, in the mere interest of the district for which they work, that these officers should have an adequate salary secured to them. The Sanitary Inspectors have duties to discharge in which judgment, discretion, and impartiality, good temper and incorruptibility have to be constantly shown, and their salaries should be such as to keep them well above the position of an ordinary mechanic. The pension, which is sometimes given with reluctance, is really one of the cheapest means of paying the officer. It is only actually incurred for an officer who survives after long service and upon his becoming incapable of further work. Inasmuch as his claim for pension is forfeited upon any misconduct or breach of trust in his office, the prospect of a pension is really the best and cheapest guarantee for the maintenance of his industry and integrity. Under date December 15th, 1896, the London County Council, taking action under the "The Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855," published a draft of proposed new 197 Bye-laws for the regulation of drainage and other sanitary works. These Bye-laws would affect property of an annual rateable value of £40,000,000 sterling. At the instance of the Public Health Committee of St. James's, a detailed report on the proposed Bye-laws was prepared by the Surveyor, Henry Monson, Esq., and myself. Our report was printed and copies were sent to the Local Government Board, to the London County Council, and to various Metropolitan Local Authorities, This report has since been practically reproduced in The Lancet (April 28th, 1897, pages 1164-5) with valuable comments which, in the main, endorse the conclusions and recommendations of our report. In that report we ventured to submit:— a. That portions of the proposed Bye-laws were prolix and obscurely worded. b. That some of the provisions were ambiguous and intelligible. c. That some of the requirements were unnecessary and oppressive. d. That in some points the requirements were inadequate. These conclusions were supported by detailed criticism of the text of the various provisions. Considering the importance of such a code of Bye-laws as affecting a vast mass of property, and the necessity of having their text so clearly worded as to be readily intelligible to practical builders and householders, it is hoped that our report may have been useful in securing reconsideration for the points in question, and that a really efficient and workable code of Bye-laws may shortly be obtained for London. The recent epidemic of Small Pox at Gloucester has served to emphasize what has long been fully appreciated by the medical profession, i.e., that we must rely upon early and efficient vaccination for the repression of Small Pox. It has long been known that survivors from attacks of Small Pox are, 198 for many years, practically insusceptible to a second infection, and that, in the small percentage of persons who take Small Pox a second time, the disease is rarely virulent. One attack of Small Pox does not absolutely prevent the possibility of taking the disease a second time. But Vaccination, which induces an attenuated Small Pox, gives to the person vaccinated the same measure of protection as is given by a previous attack of Small Pox. In those few cases in which Small Pox is taken after an efficient vaccination, the disease is shorn of its virulence as effectively as by a previous attack of unmitigated Small Pox. The protection afforded by vaccination is practically all that could be desired, while the risks and inconveniences of submitting to the operation are trivial. It is only necessary that the operation be properly done, and so efficiently as to leave three permanent scars, each such as would be left by the print of a thimble-end upon a piece of firm dough. A child so marked may be regarded as safe until the lapse of years has weakened the protective effect of the vaccination. It is well therefore to adopt re-vaccination at twelve years of age, and to have the re-vaccination repeated at thirty years of age. Practically, a person may then regard himself proof for life against Small Pox. The extent to which tbe re-vaccination places "take" is a measure of the residual susceptibility of the patient to Small Pox. In the event of the re-vaccination places taking severely the patient would, if exposed to infection, have had severe Small Pox. In the event of an efficient vaccination not taking, or taking but slightly, the patient might have been exposed to the infection of Small Pox with impunity or almost so. The use of Glycerinated Calf-Lymph obviates ignorant prejudices which have been shamelessly fostered with regard to vaccination. The supervision of vaccination is an important department of Preventive Medicine. It should not in any way be associated with Poor Law Medical Belief. It is to be hoped that at an early day legislation will transfer the Vaccination and the Vaccination Officers to the Local Sanitary Authorities, and 199 that, in the public eye, this branch of Public Health may no longer be associated with going to the workhouse. I am directed by the Local Government Board to add some information as to " the measures of Sanitary Improvement which, in my opinion, require to be carried out in the parish." In order that this may be attempted soine reference to the conditions of the parish must first be made. If a line be drawn from St. James's Palace diagonally across the parish to the junction of Oxford Street and Wardour Street, it will be seen that south of Regent's Quadrant the line traverses a rich and fashionable district, while north of Regent's Quadrant the line traverses a labyrinth of small streets through which ordinary strangers would be unable to find their way. This northern area is covered to a great extent by old houses which have passed into the hands of tenement-mongers and are let out as lodgings to the working classes who are dependent upon the splendid shops and busy warehouses of Regent Street, Bond Street, Piccadilly and St. James's Street. In these old tenement houses the rents paid by the working classes are high while the conditions under which they live are bad. The houses are largely held by tenement-mongers on short leases—a tenure which practically shuts out both freeholder and leaseholder from re-building or substantial improvement. The houses are cramped—often with basement buildings covering their entire sites; routes through the district are tortuous and the streets are narrow. These houses, in fact, are old-fashioned gentlemen's dwelling houses which have been degraded and cut up into slices, and sub-let as lodgings for the working classes. Sanitary work, in the way of reconstructing drainage, the provision of additional water-closets, the repression of overcrowding, and the enforcement of periodical cleansings, has now been pushed with increasing severity for many years — as fast as public opinion and new Public Health Acts have supported and given power to the Vestry and its Sanitary Officers. In this quarter the need for wholesale warehouses and workshops 200 subservient to the great retail shops of St. James's has caused a gradual process of extrusion with regard to the worst houses and the dirtiest of the inhabitants. A question for the consideration of the Vestry is whether the time has not arrived for quickening this process of extrusion by opening up a new street on the eastern side of, and parallel to, Regent Street. Reference to the map will show that in this way the betterment of the eastern section of St. James's would be secured in combination with a great Metropolitan improvement. Starting from the south, and going north by north-west, such new street might be run in alignment with Waterloo Place, or with the Haymarket, or with Suffolk-street, or with Whitcombe Street. Taking the Haymarket as the southern base, a new street running straight through to Poland Street would be of very great use, both to the local property and to the Metropolis. It would also add largely to the value of the extensive site on which the old workhouse now stands. At present, the poor of the Westminster Union are consigned to a deplorable existence, and I earnestly ask whether a small receiving house in St. James's, with a comfortable and cheerful new workhouse in the country, would not be a great mercy to these aged people and a great saving to the ratepayers. The wretched and dingy courtyard in which these aged people now hopelessly sit and walk—in an atmosphere grimy with the smoke of London—might be exchanged for pleasant fields and plots of garden ground in which the inmates could occupy themselves with the cultivation of vegetables or flowers. Several acres of most valuable ground in St. James's, with frontages on the new street, wTould be released for a splendid block of workmen's model dwellings, to which might be appended small workshops in which gas, water, steam or electrical motor power could be let to the skilled artizans whose livelihood depends upon their proximity to the retail shops of St. James's. It is not necessary, for me now to elaborate this proposal; it was suggested by me in 1875, but opinion was then adverse and it was allowed to rest. Now that 201 I am directed by the Local Government Board to indicate "the measures of sanitary improvement required in St. James's," I bring the idea seriously forward. The advantage of a series of model workshops for tailors, dressmakers, jewellers, engravers, and other chamber-master workers, would conduce immensely to the prosperity of the splendid retail shops and warehouses which support St. James's. If a new street were cut through on the line here suggested, the new access would immensely increase the value of the large block of property lying between the new street and Regent Street, and the old houses of the eastern side of St. James's would disappear without further effort. I commend this question earnestly to the consideration of the Vestry of St. James's. Ideals which would greatly help individual Members of the Vestry in their study of this proposal may be seen in the new townships at Leigham Court, Streatham, and at Noel Park, Hornsey, both built by the" Artizans' Labourers' and General Dwellings Company ; "also in" Lord Rowton's Houses." All these undertakings have been shaped by the same mind, and all have successfully realised the pleasant ideal of combining philanthropic work with dividends of five per cent. I have the honour to remain, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES EDMUNDS 28, Dover Street, Piccadilly. 202 PARISH OF ST. JAMES, WESTMINSTER.

Many such cases in St. James's, again, are not quite accurately described as removed from their homes."

With but few exceptions the Bakehouses wore in very fair condition, in two instances improvements have boon made in the ventilation and drainage. In eight cases it has been necessary to report certain slight defects, which were readily remedied on request. In one case we found that an underground room, immediately adjoining and opening into the Bakehouse, was being used for sleeping purposes ; this is, in our opinion, a very undesirable state of things, and although the requirements of the Factory and Workshop Acts are complied with, we consider it would bo possible to deal with this case under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and submit it to you for consideration. Ono of the Bakehouses, which was not in use at the time of our last Report, has now been entirely demolished. Taking the Bakehouses of the Parish generally they have been kept in fair cleanly condition, and every facility has been given by the owners of same for inspection when visited by us. We are, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servants, J. P. FOLLAND, T. W. CALVERLEY, Sanitary Inspectors 223 PARISH OF ST. JAMES, WESTMINSTER.

JOHN PERCY FOLLAND, THOMAS WINTER CALVERLEY, Sanitary Inspectors. 225 SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. REPORT UPON ARTICLES ANALYSED DURING THE YEAR 1896, made to the Vestry of Saint James's Westminster by JAMES EDMUNDS, M.D., M.R.C.P. Lond., F.C.S., &c„ Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, During the year 1896, under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 67 samples were examined, all which were procured for examination by the Vestry Officers. In none of these samples was any poisonous ingredient discovered. Among the samples submitted for examination, there were :— Milk 40 Butter 17 Coffee 4 Cocoa 1 Margarine 1 Mustard 1 Vinegar 3 67 226 Details of the analyses are shown in the table annexed. In no case has the results of the analysis been disputed. No money or consideration, other than the stipend paid by the Vestry, has been received by me in connection with these analyses. The subject of Standards with regard to certain articles, is still unsettled and continues to give anxiety as to legal contention in certifying the inferences which the Analyst may think to follow upon the facts discovered by the analysis. For instance, in the case of Milk, water is naturally one of the constituents, although it is the Milk Solids which give to the milk its value, and for which the milk is purchased. In different milks the proportions of water vary according to the breed and the individual peculiarities of the cow, t he food, general management, and even the method of milking. To these factors of uncertainty may be added perfectly honest carelessness in the sale and distribution of the milk. Of course, the cream rises to the top of milk which stands long in a milk shop, or is carried about in a milk can. Unless such milk be frequently stirred up, one customer may receive an unduly large proportion of cream, while the customers that follow will receive a milk which lacks its proper proportion of cream. In particular cases, one or more of these facts have to be anxiously considered by the Analyst before making up his judgment and certifying as to the amount of added water which an adulterated milk contains. But if milks were only certified as adulterated, when they fall absolutely below the lowest possible downward variation in the amount of milk solids, the Adulteration Act would be a dead letter. Again, the essence of Vinegar for pickling and other purposes is "the real Acetic Acid" which it contains. In the three Vinegars (Nos. 26, 27 & 28 of the table annexed), it will be observed that one tradesman in the parish sells a good proof vinegar, containing 6 per cent. of real Acetic Acid, while another tradesman sells a vinegar containing only 35 per cent. In some samples the Acetic Acid fills to 3.0 per cent. Here the facts of the-analysis show only the constituents of the sample. 227 The inferences governing the judgment of the analyst, as to certificating the sample as adulterated with water or not, depend upon the nature of the article, upon the customary strengths at which these various articles are manufactured and sold, and upon a variety of considerations which vary in every case. It is easy for the Analyst to determine, within one part in ten thousand, how much water is contained in 100 grains of any particular milk. But it may not be easy to demonstrate that an excess of water, when present, could not have come out of the cow and must have been added from the pump. In the case of a sick or exhausted cow, or in the case of a cow fed so as to produce ready-made milk-and-water, it is obvious that the milk is nevertheless not of the nature, substance, and quality demanded by the purchaser. The sale of such milk is therefore a fraud against which the purchaser ought to be protected. The question is how to protect the public against the sale of watered milk without doing a practical injustice to an ignorant vendor. It must be laid down that a vendor who undertakes to cater for the public has no excuse for ignorance as to the quality of the goods he sells. And with many substances, such as milk, there is no way of shutting out contention upon this point, except by arbitrarily fixing reasonable standards of quality and limits to downward variation. A good average milk should contain 12.5 per cent. (one-eighth part) of true milk solids. It will be observed in the annexed table that one milk submitted for analysis (No. 19) contained 1542 per cent. of milk solids ; while other samples showed downward variations, Avhich, in one case (No. 60), was as low as 9.90 per cent. If we regard 1T5 per cent. of true milk solids as the limit below which a fairly good milk ought not to fall, the only question that remains is how to calculate, with fairness between the vendor and the public, as to the amount of " added water " which this milk contains. Now, practically, No. 60 was a separated milk, and the deficiency was chiefly in the fat. It might be argued for the defence that this was due to mere accident in the distribution, and that a careless shopman had so ladled out some of the milk as to give all the cream to the 228 purchaser of sample 19, while the purchaser of sample 60 had received his milk denuded of its fair share of cream. Such an argument the Magistrate adjudicates upon; it does not come within the province of the Analyst. The responsibility of fairly distributing the milk rests upon the vendor, and, while a certain range of upward and of downward variation must be allowed for, milks which fall distinctly below a fixed limit of downward variation in the amount of their milk-solids, must be pronounced adulterated. Milks which I have to adjudge adulterated I thereupon certify as containing such percentage of " added water " as would dilute a fair average milk down to their point. To this question of " Standards " great consideration has been given by recent Parliamentary Committees, and probably, at an early date, legislation will follow, by which a board of experts and referees will settle the standards at which such articles should be sold, and fix the limit of downward variation which it is permissible to excuse. It is much to be desired that such standards should be settled as will promote uniformity in analytical judgments and relieve the Analyst from anxiety as to the inferences which should attach to the facts disclosed by his analyses. I have the honour to remain, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obdient Servant, JAMES EDMUNDS. 28, Dover Street, Piccadilly. 229 Table of 67 Samples submitted for examination during the year 1896 No. Article.

Vendor cautioned for selling margarine without being properly labelled. Sample was not sold as butter During the year 1896 errors occurred in the purchasing of four samples, and the numbers 14, 15, 16 and 33 were each affixed to two different samples. This error in the labels of the samples marked by a second use of the numbers 14 15 and 16 was discovered at the time of performing the analysis and, subject to proper precautions, these samples were re-marked by me with the numbers 17, 18 and 19. The sample marked by a second use of the number 33 was distinguished by me as 33a—the next number having already then been appropriated to another sample. It follows that the enumeration in the head-line is one more than the final number. A sample of water submitted to me for analysis came doubtfully under the the Food and Drugs Act, and is not enumerated in this list.
