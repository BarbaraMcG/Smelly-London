FRIERN BARNET URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. Public Health Department, 20, St. John's Villas, Friern Barnet, N. 11. May, 1939. To the Chairman and Members of the Friern Barnet Urban District Council. Gentlemen, Herewith I present to you a report upon the Health conditions in your district for the year ending December 31st, 1938. This report is drawn up in accordance with circular 1728 of October 25th, 1938, issued by the Ministry of Health. The main points of interest in the statistics are as follows (1) A decreased death-rate from 10.2 to 8.5 (2) Reduced death-rate for Tuberculosis from 0.45 to 0.17, the latter being the lowest ever recorded for this district. (3) Increased Infant Mortality. Heart disease still accounts for the greatest percentage of deaths. The decline in deaths from respiratory diseases is maintained. There is a decrease in the number of houses found to be infested with bed bugs. Generally, the health conditions in the district are very good. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, DOROTHY M. CATCHP00L. M.B., D.P.H. Medical Officer of Health. 2. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA. Area in acres-1341.2 Population Census 1931-23081. Estimated 1938 by M.O.H.-28100. " " " R.

Population. North 4702 9500 Central 4135 7500 South 3900 8200 Friern Hospital 2900 12737 28100 The registrar Generals estimate of population is 27120. BIRTHS. The numbered registered in the district was 148, and the number assigned to the district by the Registrar General 362, and this gives a birth-rate of 14.9. The infantile mortality rate is calculated on the number of births assigned to the district by the Registrar General. The still-births during the year numbered 9 , giving the rate of 24.8 per 1000 births, compared with 48.6 for 1937, and 33.0 for 1936. DEATHS. Table 2 shows in detail the registered causes of death in alphabetical order, their distribution in wards, and particulars of the inward and outward transfers. The number of deaths registered in the district was 199, giving a crude death-rate of 7.34. The nett deaths numbered 212, giving a rate (including institutional population) of 7.81. Since the preparation of the death-table, the Registrar General has assigned 211 deaths to the district, and this will give the uncorrected death-rate of 8.71 per 1000. The correcting factor for age and sex distribution is 0.98, and this gives a corrected death-rate for comparative purposes I of 8.5 per 1000. The infantile mortality rate has increased, being 55.0 per 1000 births, compared with 27.0 for 1937. Affections of the Heart and Circulatory system continue to be the principal cause of death. Cancer was again the cause of many deaths in persons over the age of 45. There was only 1 death from Infantile Diarrhoea during the year. The deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis are reduced. It is interesting to compare the death-rates each year for the past ten years from this cause. 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935 1936 1937 1938 0.41 0.21 0.47 0.39 0.57 0.61 0.54 0.53 0.45 0.17 4.

Examinations for Diphtheria, Tuberculosis etc, are now made at the laboratory in connection with the Isolation Hospital, but milk, food, water, sewage effluent and virulence tests, are done at the Clinical Research Association Laboratories. Ambulance facilities. We have now an adequate ambulance service worked from the Central Fire Station, under the control of the Chief Officer of the Fire Brigade, with an arrangement between the respective officers of Finchley, Hornsey, Southgate and East Barnet, whereby one or the other stand by for use in any district, should the necessity arise. Nursing in the home. There are three nursing associations working in the North Ward, Central Ward and Brunswick Park, and South Ward respectively. The association in the south ward has a working arrangement with the Council for the home visiting of cases of Measles. Treatment centres and clinics. These are administered by the Middlesex County Council as the Maternity & Child Welfare Authority, and the Authority having control of the School Medical Service. 5. Hospitals. There are no general hospitals within the district, nor any wholly controlled by the Sanitary Authority. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Water supply. The Barnet District Gas & Water Company continue to give an adequate and wholesome supply of water to this district. Sewage disposal. The difficulties met with in the early stages in dealing with digested sludge are now overcome, and during the latter half of the year no sludge was pumped onto the lagoons. Odour is not appreciable from digested sludge outside the works. The sludge has been used on the Council's parks, allotments and open spaces. The effluent was inspected frequently by the Lee Conservancy Board and samples taken for analysis were satisfactory. The volume of sewage dealt with during the year was 600 million gallons which included 102 million gallons from the Borough of Hornsoy. Sewerage. Flooding took place in certain parts of the district in August and alterations have been carried out to prevent a recurrence in The Crescent and Cromwell Road areas, and the situation in Colney Hatch Lane is being dealt with by embodying an improved surface water sewer in the proposed alterations to this highway. A low level soil sewer ceased to function, due to a collapse, in December-steps were immediately taken to prevent sewage passing to watercourses and as a temporary measure the sewage was diverted to the East Barnet sewerage system whilst repair work was being carried out. In accordance with the provisions of the Public Health Act 1936, the survey and plotting of sewers on large scale maps is being continued, but owing to work in connection with the above collapse, the proposed M.C.C. drainage scheme, A.R.P. etc., little progress has been made. 6. Disposal of house and trade profuse. The raising of the eastern section of the central ward allotments, which was commenced on the 8th April 1938, is proceeding, and six reconstructed plots have already been handed back to the Association. The Tip is still considered by government departments to be one of the finest of its kind, several local authorities have had men trained by working on the tip during the past year and six local authorities have paid visits for instructional purposes. Included in these visitors were the representative head of Nicosia, the capital town of Cyprus, and the Medical Officer of Health for Wellington, New Zealand. This service has been completely equipped with modern trucks, and the roadways of the district are maintained in a particularly orderly and cleanly manner. Rivers and streams. Periodical cleansing?of water-courses have been carried out. A small number of faulty house drains have been detected and the trouble abated. Oil has been found from time to time and suitable action taken. Closet accommodation. The water-carriage system is in operation throughout the district, and there are no privies, middens, or slop water closets. SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA. Tables of inspections made and defects remedied through the action of the Sanitary Inspectors will be found later in this report. A large part of the time of your Sanitary Inspectors is spent in improving the structual condition of the dwelling houses occupied by persons of the working classes; use is made of the powers given by Sec.9 of the Housing Act 1936; a few houses being dealt with at a time. The Rats and Mice Destruction Act 1919, is administered by the Middlesex County Council. A number of complaints have been received irespect of promises infested with rats, and these have immediately boen forwarded to Mr. A. Chudloy, the Rats and Mice Destruction Officer 7 for this district, Wo are constantly asked to assist various householdeTs, and tills help has always been readily given, your Sanitary Inspectors co-operating with the Middlesex County Officer. Smoke abatement. There are no factories within the district using coal fired boilers, and no action has been necessary. Swimming baths baths pools. There are no public Swimming Baths or Pools within the district, nor any attached to Restaurants or Road Houses. Eradication of bed bugs. The department continues to give assistance and advice in keeping premises free from vermin, and there has been a marked decrease in the number of such premises brought to our notice. 1. Number of Council houses found to be infested 0 " " " " disinfested 0 Number of other houses found to be infested 1 " " " " disinfested 1 2. The methods employed for freeing infested houses from bed bugs. Stripping of all wall and ceiling papers, removal of picture rails, skirting boards, architraves and other woodwork; spraying of walls, ceilings, floor and woodwork with an insecticide, followed by fumigation with a gas non-toxic to human beings. 3. The methods employed for ensuring that the belongings of tenants are free from vermin before removal to Counnil houses. Great care in selecting tenants is exercised, but no routine inspection or precautionary treatment of furniture undertaken. 4. Whether the work of disinfestation is carried out by the Local Authority or by a Contractor. The Council's workmen carry out the disinfestation of the Council houses. Disinfestation of privately owned houses is performed by men employed by the owner under the direction of the Public Health Department. 5. The measures taken by way of supervision or education of tenants to prevent infostati on or re-infestation after cleansing. Repeated visits are made to the houses after disinfestation has been carried out, to ensure that the treatment has been 8. succesful. The tenants are advised that upon any future evidence of returning infestation, they should report the fact immediately to the department. Camping sites. There are no camping sites within the district, nor any land suitable for the purpose. Schools. The schools have been regularly inspected so far as the sanitary conditions are concerned. St. Paul's schools are provided with the old type trough closets which have been maintained in clean condition by the caretaker. Those buildings provided by the Middlesex County Council as the education authority are modern and in every way satisfactory. HOUSING.
