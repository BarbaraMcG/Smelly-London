NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Board of Works, Fulham District. Gentlemen, The Metropolis Local Management Act requires that you should receive an Annual Report from your Medical Officer of Health. It may probably be considered satisfactory by your board, that I have comparatively little to report regarding the actual year of 1874. It must be remembered, however, that this report embraces the registration year (January to December inclusive), whilst under the above Act your own annual accounts are brought up to March 25th last. I could have wished that some suggestions which I have from time to time made in my serial reports had received more attention at your hands than has been realized since there are some measures which require special action on the part of a Local Sanitary Authority somewhat without the pale of ordinary proceedings, but which from their remoteness of presumed result have given place to more urgent daily wants. I refer more particularly now to the remarks 1 offered to you in my last with regard to Piggeries and their concomitant nuisances. We have, however, escaped another year from any serious penalty for any of our short comings. The year 1874 has passed away without any special blow to our previous welfare, though it has offered some warnings of coming storms since realized. The steady growth of London westward has thrown amongst us a vast and teeming population of the working-classes as well as those of more well-to-do condition and for the housing of the former many 10 Mocks of wretched and most miserably constructed dwellings continue to be erected with the most utter disregard for drainage or other sanitary appliances, now so essential. That part of Fulham, once open fields, is still being rapidly covered with streets and houses of this character, and many open spots in Hammersmith are being filled up in the same way. Our healthy neighbourhood may thus be made ere long a land of sickness and disease unless some check is given to such speculative buildings. Our natural advantage with all our care will not avail us against such utter recklessness. The mortality of the Fulham District in the past year indeed, though not excessive points in this direction. Speaking of London within the Bills of Mortality, the Registra-General in his last Annual Report says, "The last 3 years show a marked reduction in the mortality of London, and imply an improvement of the health of the drained city. The annual mortality for the 10 years 1840—49 was 25.2; for the 35 years 1840—74 it was 24.2; for the last three years 1872—74 it was 22.2." Our own mortality estimated for increase of population has been 23.85 or nearly 24 per 1,000 in 1874. I am not quite prepared to say that the Artizans Dwellings Act should be applied to our District, but as I have often said before, a new Building Act is imperatively needed. Of the Zymotic diseases, measles more than usually prevailed in 1874, and caused 80 deaths, whilst scarlet fever and diphtheria cut off 26 lives. These latter were evidently the forecast of a wider range of the Scarlet fever type, an event now too fully known to us in the present autumn. I would most especially desire in this report to draw the attention of your Board to the fact that up to the end of last year the Registrar-General had, after utilising them for his own special purposes, regularly and gratuitously forwarded to the Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health the manuscript weekly returns of mortality furnished to him by the District Registrars of Births and Deaths under the provisions of the Registration Acts, and these 11 have always formed a most useful element of information to the Local Sanitary Authorities. In the last General Public Health Act, applicable to the whole of England, however, it was considered necessary that the information conveyed in these returns should, in the interests of the Public Health, be supplied promptly and regularly by the Registrars direct to the Urban and Rural Sanitary Authorities, and provision was made in that Act for enabling the various sanitary Bodies to remunerate these gentlemen for the same. The law, as regarded the Metropolis remained unchanged, and under pressure from the London Registrars, who clamoured for equal remuneration, the Regibtrar-General has for the last twelve months withdrawn their gratuitous supply to the Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health. I had hoped to be able to make up this deficiency by extra exertion and enquiry, but both, after several months of most anxious work, have failed to secure for me the like trustworthy information, and I have consequently to ask your Board to take such immediate steps as shall in future secure the regular transmission of weekly copies of the Registrars of Deaths by the local Registrars direct to me. The entire range of Zymotic diseases have given us in 1874 a mortality of 270 against 209 in 1873, as follows:—From smallpox 0, measles 80, scarlet fever and diphtheria 26, whooping cough 42, typhus fever 1, typhoid fever 15, simple fever 11, diarrhoea 92, and cholera 3. Fifty deaths have been registered as arising from violence and 109 in Public Institutions including Reformatories, Prisons, and the Workhouse. 112 Inquests have been held. The total mortality of the year was 1646 (Hammersmith 1009, and Fulham 637) against 1504 in 1878, The latter year, including 53 weeks Registration Returns, the former only 52 weeks. Included in the above mortality will be found the deaths of 481 I 2 children under 1 year of age, with 353 of persons of GO years of age and upwards. The total births registered within the Fulham District in 1874 was 2807. In Hammersmith 1733, in Fulham 1074, showingan excess of births over deaths of 11G1. In 1873 the excess was 1,205. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your faithful servant, FREDERICK J. BURGE, Medical Officer of Health. Hammersmith, Nov., 1875. BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE FULHAM DISTRICT.
