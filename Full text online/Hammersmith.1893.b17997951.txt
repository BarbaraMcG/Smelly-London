Sanitary Department, Vestry Hall, Hammersmith, 25rd May, 1894. Gentlemen,—I beg to present to you my Annual Report for last year. My Report will deal with the vital statistics, and with the Sanitary work carried out under the direction of your Vestry during the 52 weeks ending on December the 30th, 1893. I have as usual compiled the report for that period in accordance with the directions issued by the Local Government Board. births. During last year 2,950 births were registered in this Parish, against 2,904 in the previous year. Making due allowance for the increase of the population, the number of births registered last year was 229 below the average number registered during the last 10 years. On the population estimated up to the middle of the year, i.e., 100,969 inhabitants, the number of births registered during the year was equal to an annual rate of 29'2 births per 1,000 persons living. The birth-rate in London during last year on the estimated population of London up to the middle of the year, i.e., 4,306,411, was equal to an annual rate of 30 9 births per 1,000 persons living. 155 DEATHS. During last year, 1,642 deaths were registered in this Parish, against 1,754 in the previous year. Making due allowance for the increase of the population, the number of deaths registered in this Parish last year was 99 below the average number registered during the last 10 years. Adding 321 deaths of parishioners of this Parish which took place in general hospitals and other public institutions in other parishes of London, in London County Lunatic Asylums, and Metropolitan Imbecile Asylums, and deducting 158 deaths of non-parishioners which occurred, 89 at the West London Hospital, 40 at Nazareth House, 6 at the Convent of the Good Shepherd, 13 at H. M. Prison, Wormwood Scrubs, and 10 which otherwise occurred in the Parish, the corrected number of deaths of parishioners which were registered during last year was 1,805. On the before mentioned estimated population, the corrected number of deaths of parishioners which were registered last year was equal to an annual rate of 17 '9 deaths per 1,000 persons living. The death-rate in London last year on the estimated population ot London up to the middle of the year was equal to an annual rate of 21*3 deaths per 1,000 persons living. deaths of infants. The corrected number of deaths of parishioners, under one year of age, that were registered during last year was 470, against 489 in the previous year. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age registered last year was equal to 26*0 per cent, of the total deaths of parishioners registered, and was equal to 15'9 per cent, of the total registered births. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age in London last year was equal to 23'9 per cent, of the total deaths registered, and to 164 per cent, of the total registered births. The mortality rate of infants under one year of age was therefore, as compared with the total deaths of parishioners, registered 21 per cent, greater in this Parish than in London, and, as compared with the total births registered, 05 less in this Parish than in London. 156 DEATHS OF AGED PERSONS. The corrected number of deaths of parishioners at 60 years of age and upwards that were registered during last year was 464. The number of these deaths last yesr was equal to 25.7 per cent, of the total deaths of parishioners registered. The percentage of deaths of persons at 60 years of age and upwards in London last year was equal to 23.8 per cent, of the total deaths registered. This death rate was, therefore, 19 per cent. less in London than in this Parish. The higher the death rate at 60 years of age and upwards as compared with the total deaths the more favourable is the indication. TABLE I. The following table shows the mean temperature, the estimated population, the number of persons to each acre, the number of births, the proportion of births to each 1000 persons living, the deaths (uncorrected) as registered in the parish, the proportion of uncorrected deaths to each 1000 persons living in the parish in the years 1884—1893, also the number ol corrected deaths and the proportion of corrected deaths to each 1000 persons living in the Parish in the years 1892 and 1893.

Note 1. Medical Officers of Health of " Combined Districts" must make a separate Return for the District of each Sanitary Authority. 2. Medical Officers of Health acting for a portion only of the District of a Sanitary Authority should write, in the heading of the Table, the designation of the Division for which they act. 3. The words " Urban" "Rural" or " Metropolitan " must be inserted in the appropriate space in the heading, according as the Sanitary Authority for the District is Urban or Rural, or is within the Metropolitan Area. 4. The "Localities" adopted for the purpose of these statistics should be areas of known population ; such as parishes, groups of parishes, townships or wards. As stated at the head of the first column in each Table, Public Institutions should be regarded as separate localities, and the deaths in them should be separately recorded. Workhouses, Hospitals, Infirmaries, Asylums, and other establishments into which numbers of people, and especially of sick people, are received, are Public Institutions for the purpose of these statistics. 5. The deaths which have to be classified in this Table (A), and summed up in the horizontal line of "Totals," are the whole of those registered as having actually occurred in the several localities comprised within the Division or District. But the registered number of deaths frequently requires correction before it can give an exact view of the mortality of a Division or District; and the two lowest horizontal lines are provided for the purpose of enabling Medical Officers of Health to indicate, to the best of their ability, what the extent of such corrections should be. Details concerning the corrective figures, eg., the institutions that have been considered, or the particular localities to which corrections apply, may appear in the text of the report or in supplementary tables. Area and Population of the District or Division to which this return relates. Area in Acres 2,287 Population (1891) 97,237 In recording the facts under the various headings of Tables A and B, attention has been given to the notes endorsed on the Tables. N. C. COLLIER, Medical Officer of Health. May 2yd, 1894. 159 DEATHS FROM THE 9 PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The total number of deaths of parishioners that were registered from the 9 principal zymotic diseases during last year was 286, against 345 in the previous year. The deaths of parishioners last year from these diseases were equal to 15.8 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered, and were at the rate of 0.28 deaths per 100 persons living. The deaths from the 9 principal zymotic diseases in the whole of London were equal to 144 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and were at the rate of 0 31 deaths per 100 persons living. These deaths were, therefore, as compared with the total deaths of parishioners registered 1.4 per cent. greater in this Parish than in London, but as compared with the population 0.03 per cent. less in this Parish than in London. TABLE III. The following table shows the deaths of parishioners registered from the 9 principal zymotic diseases which occurred in the years 1885 to 1893. Year. Smallpox. Measles. Scarlet Fever.

There were 1252 cases of illness reported as due to notifiable infectious diseases in this Parish during last year, against 971 in the previous year. There were also 57 cases of illness that were not notifiable under the Act, reported as due to infectious diseases, against 226 in the previous year. 160 small-pox. Twenty-one cases were reported last year as due to smallpox, against 3 cases in the previous year. Of the 21 cases which were reported last year 11 were treated at the homes of the patients, and 10 were removed by the Metropolitan Asylums Board to the Hospital Ship at Dartford. Out of the total 21 cases reported, one death occurred at the Metropolitan Asylum Board's Hospital Ship at Dartford. The patient was a non-parishioner. At the time when he was taken ill he was detained a prisoner at H.M. Prison, Wormwood Scrubs. He had just been admitted under a sentence of a month's imprisonment The mortality rate on the cases reported was 4 76 per cent. Seventeen of the patients attacked had been vaccinated in infancy, 2 patients had never been vaccinated, and in 2 cases no information as to vaccination was obtainable. In one case a patient was stated to have been re-vaccinated nine years ago. chicken-pox. No case was reported as due to chicken-pox last year, against six cases in the previous year. measles. Six cases were reported last year as due to measles, against 176 cases in the previous year. Four cases were not reported until after death; and in 2 cases the patients were at the time the disease was reported still suffering from the complaint. The 6 cases reported last year were treated at the homes of the patients. As this is not a notifiable disease, it is not worth while giving the mortality rate on the cases reported. scarlet fever. Six hundred and seventy-three cases were reported as due to scarlet fever, against 462 cases in the previous year. Two hundred and twenty-three cases reported last year were treated in Isolation Hospitals, 220 at the Western District Hospital at Fulham, 1 at the North-Western Hospital, Haverstock Hill, 2 at the London Fever Hospital at Islington, and 450 at the homes of the patients. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 4.75 per cent. 161 diphtheria and diphtheritic membranous croup. Two hundred and eighty-two cases were reported as due to diphtheria or diphtheritic membranous croup, against 322 cases in the previous year. Sixty-five cases reported last year were treated in Isolation Hospitals, 63 at the Western District Hospital at Fulham, 1 at the North-Western Hospital, Haverstock Hill, and 1 at the South-Western Hospital, Stockwell. Two cases were treated at the West London Hospital, 1 at the Fulham Union Infirmary, 1 at St. Mary's Hospital, Paddington, and 213 at the homes of the patients. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 1086 per cent. whooping cough. Fifty-one cases were reported last year as due to whooping-cough, against 53 cases in the previous year. All of the cases reported last year were treated at home, and were not reported until after death. As this is not a notifiable disease it is not worth while giving the mortality rate on the cases reported. enteric fever. Sixty-eight cases were reported last year as due to enteric fever, against 46 cases in the previous year. Thirteen of the cases reported last year were treated at the Western District Isolation Hospital at Fulham, 2 at the Fulham Union Infirmary, 2 at University College Hospital, one at the West London Hospital, and 50 at the homes of the patients. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 2206 per cent. simple continued fever. Four cases were reported last year as due to simple continued fever, against 8 cases in the previous year. The 4 cases reported last year were treated at the homes of the patients. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 50.00 per cent. relapsing fever. No case of relapsing fever was reported last year, against no case in the previous year. puerperal fever. Nineteen cases of puerperal fever were reported last year, against 6 cases in the previous year. Of the 19 M 162 cases reported last year 3 were treated at the Fulham Union Infirmary, and 16 at the homes of the patients. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 63.16 per cent. cholera. One case was reported last year as due to cholera, against no case in the previous year. The case reported last year was treated at the home of the patient. From enquiries made it appears that the patient only suffered from summer diarrhoea. He rapidly recovered. ERYSIPELAS. One hundred and eighty-four cases were reported as due to erysipelas last year, against 124 cases the previous year. Of the 184 cases reported last year, 2 were treated at the West London Hospital, 2 at Nazareth House, Hammersmith Road, 22 at Fulham Union Infirmary, one at the Marylebone Infirmary, and 157 at the homes of the patients. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 4 89 per cent. TABLE IV.

( See also Notes on back of Table A.) Note i. The present Table B is concerned with population, births, and sickness (not with mortality) in the Sanitary district or division to which the Table relates. 2. As stated in the heading of Col. (a), Public Institutions should be regarded as separate localities, and the new cases of sickness in them should be separately recorded. Workhouses, Hospitals, Infirmaries, Asylums, and other establishments into which numbers of people, and especially of sick people, are received, are Public Institutions for the purpose of these statistics. 3. Comments on any unequal incidence of notifiable disease upon the several localities, and considerations as to the local incidence of consumption and other prevalent diseases, should be made tn the text of the Report. 165 INFLUENZA. During last year 17 deaths were registered as due primarily to "influenza" against 57 cases in the previous year. Where request was made by inhabitants, disinfection of premises was carried out, but otherwise no official action was taken in reference to this disease. LICENSED SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The whole of the 17 licensed slaughter houses in the Parish were under regular fortnightly inspection by the several Sanitary Inspectors during last year. At the annual inspection of slaughter houses in October, 1893, I found that all of them were in a satisfactory condition. At the Special Sessions of the London County Council for Licensing, held on the 23rd of October, the whole of the 17 licenses were granted without opposition from your Vestry. LICENSED COW-HOUSES. The whole of the 3 licensed cow-houses in the Parish were under regular fortnightly inspection by the several Sanitary Inspectors during last year. At the annual inspection of cow-houses in October, 1893, I found 2 of them in a satisfactory condition, but in the other case, that in Glenthorne Road, I found that the dung pit was out of repair and required re-cementing. Your Vestry gave notice to the cow-keeper that you would oppose his application for a license unless he properly repaired the dung pit. At the meeting of the Special Sessions of the London County Council held on October the 23rd, the requirements of your Vestry having been complied with no opposition was offered to the renewal of the license, and the licenses applied for were granted. BAKEHOUSES. The whole of the bakehouses (63) in the Parish were under a regular quarterly inspection by the several Sanitary Inspectors during last year. In 9 instances it was reported that the premises were not in a proper sanitary 166 condition. Notices were served in each of these cases calling upon the bakers to comply with the regulations. In each instance the notice was at once complied with. SEIZURE OF UNWHOLESOME FOOD. No articles of food were found to be in such a state as to be unfit for the food of man so as to justify seizure under 54 & 55 Vic., chap. 76, sec. 47. The heavy penalties obtained some years ago have no doubt had a salutary effect in preventing food being offered for sale in such a state to justify seizure. SANITARY NOTICES AND ADMINISTRATION. During last year 2,997 notices were reported as having been served by your Sanitary Inspectors, having for their object the removal or prevention of nuisances or insanitary conditions, and during the same period 2,836 notices were reported as having been complied with. Your Vestry has, I have much pleasure in recording, at last decided to appoint a Special Sanitary Inspector for house to house inspection of the Parish. You are aware that I am of opinion that every house in the Parish ought to be examined as to its sanitary condition at least once a year. With one House to House Inspector it will take about 4 years to inspect the Parish. The appointment of one House to House Inspector does not therefore in my opinion do all that is desirable, but it is certainly a step in the right direction. SUMMONSES ORDERED. During last year your Vestry and the Sanitary Committee ordered 114 summonses against persons for having failed to comply with the requirements of your Vestry or the Sanitary Committee. Before any of the summonses were taken out a letter was written to the person in default, informing him that the Vestry or the Sanitary Committee had ordered the summons, and asking him if he were willing to give an undertaking in writing that 167 he would forthwith comply with the notice which had been served. In most instances the undertaking was at once given, and it was not found to be necessary to apply to the magistrate for a summons. SUMMONSES TAKEN OUT. During last year 10 summonses were taken out at the West London Police Court through the Sanitary Department. The following is a list of the premises in reference to which the summones was issued, with a statement as to the nature of the complaint and the result of the proceedings:— TABLE VI.

During last year your Vestry removed no dead body of a person who had died from an infectious disease to the mortuary at the Wharf, Chancellors. There 168 were 120 bodies brought to the mortuary by order of the Coroner or the Police ; 44 of these were taken from the West London Hospital, and included 18 parishioners and 26 non-parishioners. public nuisances. During last year I brought before your Sanitary Committee complaints received by me in reference to the following alleged public nuisances —i.

Vestry Hall, Hammersmith. To the Chairman and Members of the Hammersmith Vestry. Gentlemen,—During the past year the total number of articles submitted to me for analysis under the Sale of Food and Drugs and the Margarine Acts was 234. The number received during each of the four quarters of the year, and the division of these samples according to the results of analysis into genine, inferior, and adulterated, are as follows :— TABLE I.

Besides these adulterated samples were 18 others considered to be of inferior quality, although not sufficientlybad to justify their condemnation as adulterated. These inferior samples constitute, therefore, 7-69 per cent. of the whole. I wish to point out that these inferior samples were in each case samples of milk. The following table shows the percentage of adulterated and inferior samples, and also a comparison of the extent of adulteration during the past eight years:— TABLE III. Year. Total number of samples examined. Percentage of pure. Percentage Inferiot. Percentage Adulterated. 1886-87 160 83.75 91.90 16.25 1887—88 183 8.1o 1888— 89 196 74.50 12.24 13.26 1889-90 186 7797 11.82 10.21 1890—91 184 76.70 8.70 14.67 1891—92 204 74.52 15.19 10.29 1892—93 250 82.00 5.20 12.80 1893—94 234 80.34 7.69 11.97 A short note as to the result of summonses under the Adulteration Acts, see separate heading, " Result of Summonses," page 53. Respecting the samples examined :— MILK. This article is still largely sold in an adulterated state. It will be seen that out of the 64 samples examined, only 33, or 51 "56 per cent., are regarded as good milk. Eighteen of the 64 samples were of a poor quality, and 20.32 per cent, were adulterated. This is not at all satisfactory, and is, in my opinion attributable chiefly to two causes : On the one hand, the unsatisfactory state of the law respecting the sale of milk and the purchase of the same on warranty ; and on the other hand, to the comparatively trifling fines imposed in many cases. The consequences which follow the supply of adulterated and inferior samples of milk are most disastrous, seeing that it is so largely used for infants. 175 BUTTER. Of the 47 samples which were examined, 14 were found to be adulterated (29.8 per cent.). This is higher than last year by about 1 per cent.. and lower than the previous year by about 1 per cent. The percentage of foreign fat in adulterated butter is still very great, as will be readily seen from tne fact that the sample least adulterated contained 56 per cent. of foreign fat, whilst the highest adulteration was 90 per cent., and the mean of the 14 samples was 69 per cent. of foreign fat. cocoa. One sample of cocoa was found to be adulterated out of the twelve examined. In this case the sample contained 20 per cent, of sugar and 10 per cent, of starch. The remaining samples were genuine, and, generally speaking, of good quality; and it is satisfactory to find that adulteration of food in Hammersmith is limited to a comparatively few articles. It must, however, be regarded as highly unsatisfactory to find that in these few cases the adulteration of milk and butter continues to be such a serious matter.
