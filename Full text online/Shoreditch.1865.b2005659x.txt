The Inspector of Nuisances Reports as follows: I bog to submit for your information the following summary of proceedings for the removal of nuisances, and the number of sanitary works executed during the year ending March 25th, 1866, all independent of, and distinct from what has been done under the direction of the " Special Sanitary Committee." I inspected 1,026 houses, and issued the necessary orders respecting those that required improvement; 234 cesspools have been abolished; 324 proper water-closets have been erected in the place of open privies, all provided with proper trapped soil pans, and properly drained to the sewers; 150 house-drains have been cleansed and repaired; attention has been given to improve the paving of the yards and make better provision for the surface drainage. Dust-bins have been provided for G2 houses, and 25 that had been the seat of contagious disease were thoroughly lime-washed. A sewer has been put into Chatham-gardens, where there were between GO and 70 houses without the means of proper drainage, and with foul cesspools, in nearly all the yards these have all been abolished, and every privy provided with a proper trapped soil pan, and proper drain to the sewer. The number of sanitary works executed since the establishment of the Vestry, arc as follows: 3,440 cesspools have been abolished, 5,055 proper water-closets have been erected in the place of open privies, and all properly drained to the sewers; 2,547 house drains have been cleansed and repaired; 957 dust-bins have been provided, and 18G houses have had an additional window put in, to improve the ventilation. 15 In the course of the year one complaint only was made of pigs being kept so as to be a nuisance and injurious to health, notice was given to the owner to have them removed, which was done. Complaints were made that in a house in Boston-street, the body of a boy who had died from fever had been kept over throe weeks, the father and several other children occupying, and sleeping in one room, this was caused through some misunderstanding between the father and the Relieving Officer, but ultimately the body was buried from the workhouse, after being dead four weeks. I made the usual periodical inspection of the licensed slaughter houses, 81 in number, and cow-houses 49 in number, and on every occasion found them in a satisfactory condition, proper attention being paid to cleanliness, drainage, ventilation, and water supply. The effects of the cattle plague on the cowsheds of the Parish has been a great dimunition in the number of the cows, in ordinary circumstances the usual number always exceeded COO while at present there are 17 sheds entirely empty, and in the remaining 32 there are only 135 cows, or about one fifth of the usual number. During the year there were 1,614 applications to have dust removed, which were all promptly attended to by the Contractor. The cleansing of the roads and streets has been generally satisfactory; during the winter several complaints were made of places being neglected, to which the special attention of the contractor was directed, and the evil remedied. Since the passing of "The Cattle Disease Prevention Act," great difficulty has been experienced in getting dung removed, the county magistrates of Kent and Essex understanding the Act empowered them to prohibit entirely all manure from the metropolis being brought into their jurisdictions, issued orders accordingly, and hence the difficulty, but the Justice, construction of the Act has been decided by the Secretary of State to be wrong, and the prohibitory orders considerably relaxed. I summoned one person before the Magistrate at the Police Court, Worship Street, for refusing or neglecting to comply with a notice 16 to abolish cesspools, and drain nine houses in Oakford-place, Goldsmith'srow; on hearing the case the Magistrate made an order for the work to he done, and it was executed accordingly. I summoned another individual, the owner of six houses in Motleystreet, Curtain-road, to shew cause why the said houses should not be closed as unfit for human habitation, he did not appear, but closed the houses, and so the object sought for was gained. Complaints have been made in several quarters of an insufficient water supply, in consequence of the water not being allowed to run long enough to fill the butts and cisterns, and in some houses where there are three or four families living they do not get as much as they require. The present mode of intermittent supply also prevents in many instances the inhabitants of courts and alleys from obtaining a plentiful service of pure water, in these places the usual receptacle is one butt or cistern to supply the whole, and these are frequently in a filthy state, their insides lined with slimy vegetation, so that the water is unfit for human use; the only remedy for all these evils would be to dispense with butts and cisterns altogether, and have a constant supply from the mains, in which case there would be a less waste of water than under the present system. The great hindrances to sanitary improvement are such as can only be dealt with by official interference to a very limited extent, overcrowded dwellings and poverty usually go hand in hand, and are a prolific source of disease, and at present from the operation of various causes, they show a tendency to increase and multiply themselves, accelerated by the difficulty of procuring house accommodation and the high price demanded for it, and thus scarcity of houses drives people into places that are in themselves unfit for habitation, not having the elements of life and health about them. There are certain sanitary arrangements necessary for every dwelling to secure a very moderate degree of comfort, among which are an adequate supply of light, air and water. 17 Bills in Parliament, Session 1865—6. Gas Light and Coke Company. The principal object of this Bill was to purchase land at Hackney Wick, in the Parishes of Hackney and Bow, for the purpose of erecting Gas Works, and laying down mains and pipes, from such Gas Works to their gas district. The Vestry petitioned against this Bill, and it was thrown out in the House of Lords. Imperial Gas Company Bill. This Bill was for the purpose of erecting works near Victoria Park, it was first brought forward in the House of Lords, but in consequence of the strong opposition to it, it was withdrawn. The Vestry petitioned against the Bill. Great Eastern Railway Bill. This Railway is to cross the High-street, Shoreditch, and Commercial-street, by bridges, and to join the main line of the Great Eastern, near Tapp-street, Bethnal-green. The Petition of the Vestry against this Bill was unsuccessful; but clauses were inserted for the protection of the privileges of the Parish. London (City) Corporation Gas Bill. This Bill was for the purpose of empowering the City Authorities to purchase land at West Ham, in Essex, erect Gas Works, and supply the City of London with Gas. The Vestry petitioned in favour of this Bill, but it was lost. The following Bills have been before Parliament this Session: Metropolis Gas Act Amendment Bill. Abolition of Church Rates Artizan's and Labourer's Dwellings Bill. 18 Commons (Metropolis) Bill. Revising Barristers Qualifications Bill. Railways Clauses Bill. Representation of the People Bill.

By the Act of the 28th Victoria, cap. 90, the duty of extinguishing fires and protecting life and property in case of fire, and the care and maintenance of the Fire Engines, &c., for the metropolis, was entrusted to the Metropolitan Board of Works, from the 1st. January, 1866, and the Board not having completed the necessary arragements for the carrying out the Act of Parliament, requested the Vestry to take upon themselves the care of the Engines, Station, &c., until the 1st. July, 1866. The Vestry upon such application took upon themselves the care of the Engines, &c., appointed an Engineer at £2 2s. 0d. a week, with an Assistant at £1 5s. a week; and also entered into an agreement for a horse and driver, to horse the Engine at all times, either day or night, at £1 per week. The Churchwardens at the desire of the Vestry, have taken upon themselves the payment of all expenses connected with the Fire Engines, to be repaid by the Vestry. The amount expended for the three months, to March 31st., is £65 6s. 5d. 19 Meetings of Vestry and Committees. The Vestry have held 53 meetings during the year.
