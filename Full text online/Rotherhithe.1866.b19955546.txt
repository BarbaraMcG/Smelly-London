The Metropolitan Board of Works having in July, 1866, made their order that the whole line of thoroughfare heretofore known by the names of Union-road, Paradise-row, Edenterrace, Broad-pavement, Union-row, Gomm-terrace, &c., be called Unton-road, and that the same be re-numbered throughout, the odd numbers, commencing with No 1, and ending with 95, being assigned to the houses on the north side, and the even numbers, commencing with No. 2, and ending with 110, to those on the south side, such numbers to commence at the west end, and that the names, Paradise-row, Eden-terrace, Broad-pavement, Union-row, Gomm-terrace, and any other name or names then in use in Union-road, and Paradiserow, and the existing numbers be abolished. The Vestry caused notices to be served on the several occupiers ot houses in the said thoroughfare, requiring them to re-number their houses in accordance with the order of the Metropolitan Board of Works, and such re-numbering has since been carried out. B. L. Judkins, Esq., the late member representing this Vestry in conjunction with St. Olaves District Board of Works, at the Metropolitan Board of Works, having retired in June, 1866, by effluxion of time, Thomas Turner, Esq., of Guy's Hospital, was elected in his stead. 17 In August, 1866, the Vestry presented a Memorial to the Metropolitan Board of Works, on the subject of the rating of the City of London, and urging that Board to cause inquiry to be made whether the assessment of the City of London for the expenses of the Metropolis Local Management Act, Main Drainage and Fire Brigade Act, was made upon a like estimate or basis as the County Rates of the rest of the Metropolis, and upon being satisfied that an inequality existed, that the Board would take steps to ensure a uniformity of basis. Upon the introduction into Parliament by the Metropolitan Board of Works of "A Bill to make better provision for the raising of money, to be applied to the execution of Works of permanent Improvement in the Metropolis," and the Vestry being of opinion that if it were allowed to pass into a Law, it would very seriously effect the Owners of Property and Ratepayers, in this parish, they petitioned the House of Commons against the Bill, and memorialized the Metropolitan Board of Works to withdraw the said Bill from Parliament. The several Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis having appointed Delegates to confer as to the best means for obtaining a better supply of gas, this Vestry appointed Mr. Edmond George Dannell as their Delegate, who attended all the meetings upon the question, and suggestions for the Amendment of the Metropolis Gas' Act, 1860, were drawn up and presented by the Delegates to the President of the Board of Trade, who then informed the Deputation that a Bill upon the subject would no doubt be shortly brought before Parliament, when the suggestions of the Delegates should be embodied therein. The boundaries of this parish were perambulated on Holy Thursday, 1866. Upon application made by the Contractors to the East London Railway Company, the Vestry sanctioned the temporary diversion of the Deptford Lower-road, at the site of the "Jolly Calkers" Public-house, during the execution of the Railway works at that spot; also the temporary stopping-up of the Carriage-way, Westfield-terrace, and the diversion of the traffic through Cross-street, Baltic-place. The Vestry also sanctioned the formation of temporary level Crossings at the following Streets, viz.:— Hotherhithe-street at the Thames Tunnel, Adam-street, and Albion-street, upon the erection and maintenance by the Contractor of proper gates and foot-bridges, for the protection and convenience of the Public. The Metropolitan Board of Works have entered into Contracts for the formation and drainage of roads, and for fencing and erection of Lodges in "Southwark Park," as follows, viz.:— £. s. d. Mr. James Clarke, Formation of Roads, &c. 2,812 0 0 Mr. James Clarke, Drainage of Roads, Ac. 2,417 0 0 Mr. C. N. Foster, Construction of principal Lodge, Entrance Gateways, Enclosure Palings, Railings, &c. 3,950 0 0 £9,179 0 0 And the works are now (June, 1867) in active operation. The wntern portion of the Surrey Mill-stream,Jamaica Level, up to Swan Bridge, has F 18 been piped by the Leaseholder; this vestry having contributed £35 towards the cost thereof. The Millpond Bank has since been levelled down, and the footpath is about to be properly made up and kerbed. A further improvement has been made in Rotherhithe Street near Hanover Street, by widening the same 3 feet 6 inches in front of Mr. G. Hallett's premises, at a cost to the Yestry of £250. In November, 1866, the Yestry received Parliamentary Notices from the promoters of the following schemes, viz. :— "Amendment of the Metropolis Gas'Act, 1860, and of the Local and Personal Acts, relating to the Supply of Gas in the Metropolis and adjacent Districts." "London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Bill" (new-works). As the latter scheme did not interfere with the roadways or paths in this parish, no opposition was made thereto by the vestry. By direction of the Vestry the Chairman and Clerk attended before the Select Committee of the House of Commons, appointed to inquire into the Local Government and Local Taxation of the Metropolis, and were examined as to the working of the Metropolis Local Management and Nuisances' Removal Acts in this parish. The Select Committee have since made their Report to Parliament, recommending, amongst other things, the readjustment of the existing divisions of the Metropolis, for the purpose of Local Government, by the formation of larger Districts, and the substitution of a Common Council in each such District, in lieu of the Vestries and District Boards. APPENDIX No. 1. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. From 25th March, 1866, to 24th March, 1867. To the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, Surrey. Gentlemen, In presenting my First Annual Summary, my feelings constrain me to express my regret at the loss ot Dr. Murdoch, who was suddenly removed from us in the prime of life and usefulness; a man who I admired for his professional character and social qualities, and esteemed 19 as a friend; and who laboured zealously and efficiently in the discharge of his duties as Medical Officer of Health in this parish. His death having occurred in October last, about half the labour to which this Report refers has been performed by me, that portion of the year extending from the latter part of September 1866 to March 24th 1867. The review of the year is not discouraging; it is true the number of deaths has increased, and the births diminished, in proportion to increase of population, compared with the former twelve months, which was an unusually healthy season; but if we bear in mind, that during the period to which this statement alludes, London and its suburbs, as well as England in general, have been visited by two destructive epidemic diseases, Cholera and Small-pox, I think we have reason to be satisfied and thankful, that the death-rate has not materially increased. The population of this parish, I estimate at twenty-eight thousand, which is rather below the number calculated by the Registrar-General; the fixed population may be considered about twenty-six thousand, and the additional two thousand are made up by seamen who enter the parish, and persons engaged in public works, or who are otherwise casually employed. Adopting this number we shall find, on analyzing the births and deaths, the following results:— The births registered amounted to 968, being an excess of 16 over the previous year, and 368 of deaths. This number consisted of 520 males and 448 females. The four quarterly tables, and the four added together in a fifth table, will exhibit the mortality of the twelvemonths; from March 25 to June 24, 1866, the deaths registered were 141, from June 24, to September 29, 163, from September 29, to December 25,163, from December 25 1866, to March 24 1867, 155, total 622. This number includes 57 inquests, of which 22 were not residents of the parish, but persons who had been drowned, and whose bodies had been recovered from the river, this circumstance diminishes the number of deaths by 22, and places it exactly at six hundred. It may be useful to compare the mortality of the year with that of the two preceding years, to arrive at the comparative death-rate. No. of deaths Regd. Corrected mortality. Deathrate. From March 1864, to March 24, 1865 592 557 21.8 do. 1865 do. 1866 581 557 20.14 do. 1866 do. 1867 622 600 21.12 The greatest number of deaths occurred in early life; 244 were under two years of age, 57 between two and five, nnd 21 between five and ten, forming 332, or more than half the quantity; it is not the lot of man to live frequently to a very advanced age; only twelve deaths having happened between eighty and ninety years of age, and one, the oldest registered, 91 years. The year was remarkable for an outbreak of Epidemic or Asiatic Cholera; it was not unexpected; its approach having been indicated by the occurrence of several cases the previous year, the warning had given time to make preparation for the advent of this dreadful disease, and Rotherhithe employed energetic measures to mitigate the severity of the visitation. 20 The vestry formed a permanent Committee. Two additional Inspectors of Nuisances were appointed. The Parish was divided into districts to which a Medical Visitor was appointed; this officer for the time, was empowered to attend gratuitously every case he was called to in his district; to order suitable nourishment and comforts, to examine the sanitary state of the place, and if necessary, to report thereon to the Medical Officer of Health; in fact to act in conformity with the regulations of the Privy Council. A proper supply of disinfectants was deposited under the care of the Chief Inspector of Nuisances, which were liberally supplied to those who required them. The Yestry also determined that any person could be gratuitously supplied with a bottle of medicine, according to the Prescription of the Medical Officer of Health, from a druggist in the locality in which he resided, who was authorized to dispense it. It is difficult to say to what an extent these measures limited the disease, but happily Cholera passed over this Parish with great mildness; the first death registered was on July 14, 1866, and the last, October 14; during the interval, 21 deaths took place. The following table will represent the relative ages:— 2 to 5 5 to 10 10 to 20 20 to 30 30 to 40 40 to 50 50 to 60 Total. 2 6 3 3 3 3 1 21 The above-named cases occurred chiefly among the very poor; only two adult persons were above the rank of labourers, and the parents of the children were poor and lived in places where epidemic diseases are nourished and propagated. Locality.— One (the first case), took place in Maria-terrace, Potherhithe New-road; four in Commercial-street, four in St. Mary's-buildings, three in Frederick-place, one in Unionroad, one in Hanover-street, one in Prospect-place, one in York-cottages, one in Lower Queenstreet, one in Swan-lane, one in John's-place, one in Russell-street, and one in the Workhouse; thus it will appear that Cholera did not exist in any particular locality, but was diffused over the Parish. I he deaths arising from Diarrhoea were eighteen, sixteen being under two years of age. Lighteen deaths were occasioned by Small-pox, sixteen being below ten years of age; some of these cases had not been vaccinated, but it was not possible to ascertain how many. The performance of sanitary work has exceeded that of the former year, 158 notices have been served for the removal of nuisances; these consisted of defective drainage, offensive accumulations of manure, foul collections of fluid matter, pigs, &c. In some cases houses have been so dilapidated and filthy, as to require interference; in almost all cases inspected by Mr. Sanders and myself, we have not been considered intruders, and the necessary work has been done without having recourse to stronger measures than serving a notice; in one instance, 21 a summons had been served, but the offender executed what was required without the order of a magistrate. During, the post year a great public work has been in progress, the construction of a new Sewer in lieu of the long-abused "elongated Cesspool;' in the execution of such a work, an occasional nuisance and some personal inconvenience were unavoidable, both the Inspector of Nuisances and myself exercised proper vigilance; and I am happy to bear testimony to the readiness of the Contractor to attend to suggestions, having a sanitary bearing, and to the courtesy of the officers generally. The work is not sufficiently completed to ascertain if foul emanations from the Sewers will be prevented in future; but I trust, when perfect working order is established, our streets will not be polluted, and public health injured, by the exhalation of poisonous gases from the Sewers. The de6cient supply of water in the western district of the Parish, has caused inconvenience, if not injury, and many complaints have been the result; the Company has been applied and appealed to; but at present the supply is inadequate to the wants of the inhabitants. The Slaughter-houses and Cow-houses have been visited from time to time, and the proprietors exercise sufficient care and cleanliness to prevent complaint being made. The Bakehouses have also been inspected and their condition found satisfactory. An Act of Parliament— the 29th and 30th of Victoria, cap. 75— gives increased powers to suppress nuisances, improve the habitations of the poor, and prevent overcrowding; and as the Vestry has adopted its provisions, I trust we shall soon perceive beneficial lruits arising from It. In conclusion, I beg to acknowledge the kind assistance I have received from the Officers of the Vestry in the performance of my new duties, and trust to your forbearance for any shortcomings. Yours respectfully, SAMUEL TILLEY. Rotherhithc, July, 1867. G 22 Table of the Mortality of Rotherhithe, from March 25,1866, to March 24, 1867. First Quarter, from March 25th, to June 23rd, 1866.
