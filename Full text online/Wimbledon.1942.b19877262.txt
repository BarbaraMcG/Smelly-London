Birtlis.— The statistics supplied by the Registrar-General show that during 1942 the total number of registered live births belonging to Wimbledon amounted to seven hundred and fifteen, (three hundred and ninety-two males and three hundred and twenty-three females). This gives a birth rate equal to 15.46 per thousand of the population. Fifty-six of the births were illegitimate. Of this number twenty-two were males and thirty-four females. In addition, twenty-two stillbirths (seven males and fifteen females) were registered. Public Health Act, 1936 - Notification of Births. During the year seven hundred and forty-seven births were notified by the following persons Parents 3 Midwives 217 Doctors 21 Other persons 506 Total 747 Fifteen of these notifications were in respect of stillbirths. Of the seven hundred and forty-seven notifications, three hundred and forty-two were received from Medical Officers of Health of outside areas, and related to births which had occurred to Wimbledon residents confined outside the Borough. Similarly, sixty-eight confinements occurred in Wimbledon amongst women whose homes were situated in other districts. Tho net. number of notified births belonging to Wimbledon is, therefore, six hundred and seventy-nine. Deaths.- The total number of deaths registered in the district was five hundred and twenty-six (two hundred and two males and three hundred and twenty-four females), equal to a death rate of 11.37 per thousand of the population. Tho deaths occurring outside the district, of persons belonging to this Borough were three hundred and sixteen. The deaths occurring within the district, of persons not belonging thereto were one hundred and fifty-seven. Taking these figures into consideration, the total number of deaths properly belonging to Wimbledon is six hundred and eighty-five and the crude death rate 14,81 per thousand of the population. The death rate shows a slight increase on the figure for the previous year. 4. The crude death rate is, strictly speaking, not comparable with the figure for England and Wales. in order to provide for this the Registrar-General introduced some years ago an areal comparability factor. This factor, however, is not available this year, but assuming it to be the same as for 1940 the adjusted death rate for Wimbledon would be 12.44 per thousand of the population as compared with a figure of 11.6 per thousand for England and Wales.

Laboratory Facilities. The Corporation employ a part-time bacteriologist for the examination of pathological specimens. The Department suffered a great loss by the death, in February, of Dr. J.H. Johnston who had carried out much of the laboratory work in the Borough for many years. Arrangements were then made for this work to be done by Dr. Deas in the pathological laboratory at the Nelson Hospital. For special investigations advantage was taken of the facilities available at the Emergency Public Health Laboratory of the Ministry of Health at Epsom and a considerable number of specimens was sent for examination in 1942. In addition, the laboratory provided at the Health Centre is utilised for the examination of pathological specimens from the Infectious Diseases Hospital. This work is carried out by the staff of the Public Health Department.

The question of the provision of a War-time Nursery in the Nursery premises at Hubert Road was considered in the latter part of 1941. This resulted in proposals being submitted to the Ministry of Health and the Nursery was opened in March, 1942.
