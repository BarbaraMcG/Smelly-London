Fifth Annual Report OF THE VESTRY OP THEIR PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT, 18 & 19 Vic., cap. 120. LONDON: PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE VESTRY, BY E. BILLING & SON, BERMONDSEY STREET. 1861. 4 which, I think it right to inform you, there were several combining circumstances occurred which somewhat enhanced the cost of these repairs,—First, the severity of the late winter (which for some years past was unexampled) through which the roads and footways after being frost bound to a considerable depth; on the occurrence of the thaw which followed, caused them to become so much out of repair throughout the entire Parish, that considerable additional reparation was thereby rendered necessary, added to which, also consequent upon the thaw, the almost universal bursting of the water pipes, (and in many instances the gas pipes also) tended materially to impair the condition of the roads. A second and third cause also producing the above result, was the execution of the Main Drainage "Works, and the Eailway Works, which were then, and now are, going on in several parts of the Parish ; these Public Works, although much ultimate advantage may be expected therefrom, have caused an immense amount of additional cartage over the roads under the control of the Vestry, and has produced a large amount of wear and tear thereon, more especially in localities where, under ordinary circumstances, they are usually the least expensive to keep in repair. The foregoing remarks I do not intend should lead you to infer any great increase of expenditure beyond that provided in the estimates, but rather to shew that but for such unusual circumstances a balance in favor might have resulted. However, notwithstanding which, I believe I may confidently claim for this Parish, such a condition of its public thoroughfares, as is satisfactory to the public at large. NEW ROADS. A length of about Six Hundred feet of New Eoad (being a part of St. James Street, Hatcham) has by contribution, from 5 the Inhabitants of the locality, been reparied and dedicated to public control. Also a length of about Two Hundred feet of Road in Windmill Lane, at the boundary between the Parishes of Camberwell and Newington has been widened, repaired and dedicated. Similar road improvements are now being carried out by the Vestry, which will form a portion of the current year's proceedings, and as has been referred to in former reports, frequent negociations for the like objects have been considered by the Vestry, but in most instances have failed to be brought to a satisfactory conclusion for the want of Legislative power. PAVED AND KIRBED FOOTWAYS. In the accounts, it will be seen that during the past year about £600 has been expended under this head, being about £200 in excess of the sum usually included in the estimates for this description of work, which excess was found necessary to be incurred, not so much in the extension of Paving and Kirbing, as in the repair of that already laid in the main thoroughfares of the Parish, and which the wear of some years had necessitated. In reference to the laying down additional Paving and Kirbing so much needed:—this, by a recent Vote of the Vestry, is about to be carried out to a limited extent, and which additional outlay continued, if only progressively, will be productive of much ultimate saving, and in addition, effect a result anxiously sought for by the Vestry, I mean giving general satisfaction to the Ratepayers at large. 6 SEWERS. During the last Twelve months the Public Sewers Works executed by the Vestry has been as follows,— BRICK SEWERS. PIPE SEWERS. "3.0" x "2.0" "2.9" bar. 12" pipe. 9" pipe. 332.0 10.0 1210.0 100.0 500.0 700.0 140.0 1200.0 1682.0 x 110.0 1792 The above is inclusive of 360-feet of open Sewer arched over.

The above are at present Private Roads, but will eventually become public thoroughfares, and the Sewers of which will form a portion of the General Drainage of the Parish. MAIN DRAINAGE WORKS. Under this head there is nothing to add beyond that explained in my last year's Report. The Southern High Level Sewer "Works continue to progress in several parts of the Parish, and by the end of the year will, I anticipate, approach near to completion; the period when use may be made of this Sewer for Local Drainage, will of course depend upon the completion of the "Outfall Works" at Erith, and the Pumping Station at Deptford, both of which Works are in course of execution. The Main Low Level Sewer referred to in my last Report, has not as yet been contracted for; this Work will, I believe, be entertained by the Metropolitan Board at no distant date. 8 It is however satisfactory to remark, notwithstanding the often urged necessity for increased Drainage, this Parish has been by the operations of the Vestry, almost wholly relieved from the numerous complaints formerly so common, of the condition of its then imperfect Sewerage, and I may Report that during the last Twelve months, no complaint of this character has been laid before the Vestry. The inspection of House Drainage, Removal of Nuisances, and other matters of a like description, and which are as essential to be attended to as the important question of Sewerage itself, receive constant attention, and I venture to say, produce those favourable results which my valuable co-partner in Sanitary Improvement in the Parish, will no doubt detail to you in his Report. The Sewers under the control of the Vestry, in extent, are as follows,— Brick Sewers 15¼ Miles. Pipe „ 6½ „ Open „ 7½ „ Total 29¼ Miles. I am enabled to Report the above in a satisfactory and working condition, the necessary repairs to which have been executed as far as have been considered necessary and expedient, but in such repairs it has been the aim of the Vestry to limit them, until the full developement of the Main Drainage Scheme (so as to prevent unnecessary outlay) except in such places where they were absolutely needed, or where such reparation could be eventually made to form a portion of the improved system of the Sewerage ultimately to be carried out in this Parish. 9 LIGHTING. The number of Public Lamps in the Parish are as follows,— No. Lighted by the South Metropolitan Gas Company 1162 Ditto Phœnix do 57 Ditto Crystal Palace do 6 Total 1225 No. Additional Lamps erected this year 16 Removals 32 Further to extend this Report will be unnecessary, except again to avail myself of the opportunity to express my sincere appreciation of the kindness with which you support the humble services of Your faithful Servant, Office of Works, Wells Street, Camberwell, June 25th, 1861. J. C. REYNOLDS, SURVEYOR. 1860-61, MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. ANNUAL REPORT BY J. S. Bristowe, Jun. M.D., Lond, Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, Physician to St. Thomas's Hospital. Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you my Annual Report on the sanitary condition of the parish of Camberwell. It is short, because little of unusual interest has occurred to call for special comment; but it will, I hope, prove satisfactory, for it bears testimony to the general good health which the parish has enjoyed, and to the sanitary benefits which the district generally, but the poorer localities especially, have derived from the constant supervision of your health-officers. The actual number of deaths recorded during the year 1860 is 1328, a number smaller than those registered in each of the years 1858 and 59, but larger than those registered in each of the years 1856 and 57. If, however, we allow for the increase of population which has gradually taken place, on the scale at which I have calculated it for former years, the number of inhabitants in the parish about the middle of 1860 was greater than the number present in the middle of 1856 by 6000 souls; and if we base our estimate of the mortuary per centage on these data, we find that the death-rate during the 14 year 1860 was 1.94 per cent. a rate not higher than that of the very healthiest of the preceding years of my tenure of office, and less than that calculated by the Registrar General for the current year for London as a whole, or for any one of its five groups of districts We are then, I conceive, fairly entitled to regard the year 1860 as one of the healthiest which we have experienced (a fact confirmed by the Registrar General's annual report), and equally entitled to maintain, unless anything should appear in the details of the report to invalidate this conclusion, that Camberwell continues to be one of the healthiest parts of the Metropolis. No doubt insanitary conditions influence the mortality of many diseases which they do not cause; and produce in many persons states of ill-health, which render life irksome or prevent it from being profitably employed, but which do not necessarily terminate in death. In reference to the latter point, although I could indicate here and there localities in which, judging from the Parochial Medical Officers' returns and from other sources of information, non-fatal illnesses due to such causes have arisen, I feel bound on the whole to assert that sickness thus produced has been far from generally prevalent. And in reference to the former point, I may remark that the deleterious influence of insanitary conditions on the event of diseases would be indicated and judged of by increased heaviness of general mortality, and that its absence on the other hand must be assumed, when, as in our case on the present occasion, the mortality tables are unusually light. Nor does the satisfactory inference which the above considerations tend to establish diminish in force, when tested by a more minute analysis of the Tables appended to this report. The chief further points on which our estimate must be grounded are, 1st, The state of infantile mortality, and 2nd, The prevalenoe or non-prevalence of epidemic and endemic diseases. 15 1st.—It will be seen that 472 children died under five years of age. This number is unquestionably large, for it forms 35.5 per cent. of the entire number of deaths. But the infantile mortality is certainly not larger than it usually is in proportion to the gross number of deaths, and when compared with the very numerous births (2243) which have occurred in the same period, may be accepted as an indication, on the whole, of favorable infantile health. 2nd—Have epi-or en-demic diseases prevailed to any serious extent? Of course the various affections which constitute these classes of disease, have as usual varied in the number of victims which they have severally made, but the aggregate mortality from these causes has been light. Both fever, scarlet-fever, diphtheria, and small-pox have been less fatal than they were last year, and though hooping-cough and measles have slightly increased, the mortality from them has not been high. Further, diarrhoea, which is generally fatal during the autumn, especially to young children, has prevailed to a very inconsiderable extent. Hence the statement with which I started relative to the health of Camberwell during the year 1860, may be looked upon as confirmed from all points of view. The following is a brief summary of the more important results of the mortuary tables, with the sole addition of occasional brief explanatory comments. Of the deaths, 1328, (see Table I,) which occurred during 1860, 608 took place in males, 720 in females, 19 occurred in Dulwich, 353 in St. George's, 461 in Camberwell and 495 in Peckham. Of the 461 returned for Camberwell, however, (see Table II,) 61 took place in the Lunatic Asylums and 90 in the Workhouse. In Dulwich, the deaths were fewer by 1 than last year, in St. George's fewer by 11, in Camberwell fewer by 22, and in Peckham fewer by 5. 16 472 deaths occurred under 5 years of age, 50 between 5 and 10, 17 between 10 and 15, 25 between 15 and 20, 74 between 20 and 30, 107 between 30 and 40, 102 between 40 and 50, 105 between 50 and 60, 137 between 60 and 70, and 239 from 70 upwards. It will be observed that a very large proportion of deaths took place at a very advanced age. As regards the causes of death, it will be seen that 70 death are tabulated under the general head of "violence, privation, poison and premature birth;" 26 under that of "fever;" 7 under that of "dysentery and acute diarrhœa (not of infants) and cholera;" 45 under that of "scarlet-fever and diphtheria;" 5 under that of "small-pox;" 14 under that of "erysipelas, pyœmia and puerperal fever;" 166 under that of "diarrhœa, bronchitis and pneumonia of infants under three years of age;" 91 under that of "measles, hooping cough and croup;" 96 under that of "hydrocephalus and convulsions of infancy;" 191 under that of "phthisis and other tubercular diseases;" and 617 under that of "other diseases chiefly chronic." In the whole list of fatal diseases, those which are sometimes called "zymotic," are the most immediately important for us, and in reference to them we may go into a little further detail, (see Table V.) Fever occasioned 26 deaths, 5 less than in the previous year; of these 5 occurred in St. George's, 10 in Camberwell and 11 in Peckham. Scarlet-fever caused 34, diphtheria 11 deaths,—together 45. Of this total, 13 took place in St. George's, an equal number in Peckham and 19 in Camberwell; but altogether there were fewer deaths by 37 from these causes than there were in 1859. 5 deaths, 2 in Camberwell, 2 in Peckham and 1 in St. George's, were due to small-pox—12 deaths were due to small pox in the previous year. Hooping cough and measles together were fatal in 76 instances, of which 18 took place in Camberwell, 27 in Peckham and 31 in St. George's. The total number of deaths 17 from these two diseases was greater by 10 than that returned in the year 1859. It is clear, therefore, that notwithstanding a slight increase in hooping cough and measles, there was on the whole a decided decrease in the prevalence of zymotic diseases. The number of deaths occurring in the different seasons of the year (see Table III,) varied considerably; in the first quarter there were 436, in the second 347, in the third 233, and in the fourth 312. It will be observed that the highest mortality was in the autumnal season, at which time, when cholera and other like epidemics prevail, the death-rate is commonly rendered excessive. 2243 births (see Table VI,) were registered during the twelve months, 1160 of boys and 1083 of girls; of these 25 occurred in Dulwich, 648 in Camberwell, 681 in St. George's and 889 in Peckham; altogether 48 more children were born during 1860 than during the previous year. Since the time at which this report was due, a few of the more important results of the late census have been made known. It would hardly be in order now to comment at any length on a subject which, however important it may be, belongs essentially to the year 1861, and has an indirect bearing only on the year to which my present report relates. Still as the enumeration of a few of the main points indicative of the progress of the parish will occupy but a line or two, and as I shall be by them enabled to test the correctness of the inferences which I have hitherto drawn with regard to the death-rate of the parish, I will venture briefly to state them. In the decennial period between the spring of 1851 and that of the current year (see Table IV,) it appears that the population of Camberwell has been augmented by 16,821 persons, and that the number of inhabitants which at the earlier date 18 was 54,667, was at the latter date 71,488. It will be further seen on reference to the Table, that the population of Dulwich has in the same interval increased from 1632 to 1723, that of Camberwell from 17,742 to 21,297, that of St George's from 15,849 to 20,333, and that of Peckham from 19,444 to 28,135. This rapid and general growth of the parish is of course gratifying in more points of view than one. But it is satisfactory to be able to point out that it is actually greater than the calculations which I had made had led me to anticipate, and that hence the death-rate which I have year by year assigned to Camberwell, has been actually in excess of the real death-rate of the parish; the difference it is true has been very small, but still quite sufficient to shew that in comparing the health of Camberwell with that of London, I have not erred on the side favorable to ourselves—I have not exaggerated the salubrity of the district. On referring to my report for the year 1856, it will be seen that I estimated the population of that year at 62,167; judging from the census just published, it was probably about 63,079. On the same principle I calculated that the population in 1860 at about 68,167, whereas in truth it was doubtless as high as 69,807; and the number of deaths during that year, which in the earlier part of this report I have estimated at 194 in 10,000, was really no more than 190. Tho sanitary works effected during the twelve months, which terminated on the 31st March, 1861, by myself, and the Inspectors of Nuisances acting under me, may be enumerated as follows:—(see Table 7 ) 2100 houses have been systematically inspected; as a result of these inspections, 237 houses have been cleansed and whitewashed and 48 repaired; 40 yards have been paved and amended; 48 dust-bins have been provided; water for drinking 19 purposes has been supplied to premises in 151 instances; water has been laid on to closets in 50 cases; 495 cess-pools have been emptied, and 176 filled up and abolished; 145 water-closets have been provided, and 425 drains trapped and amended. In addition to the above, 1623 nuisances of various kinds, arising from pigs, accumulation of dung, refuse, ashes, &c., have been inspected and removed, or abated; the various mews have, during the summer months, been periodically visited and cleansed; and the slaughter-houses, 42 in number, have been supervised, and when necessary have been whitewashed, paved or otherwise improved. Many of the above works were executed on the mere hint furnished by the visit of inspection; in other cases notices had to be served on the persons concerned; 404 first notices were issued, and in 20 instances the notices had to be repeated. It was only necessary in 5 cases to apply for summonses. At the close of the year 18 works were outstanding or in progress. A few trades—nuisances have been, from time to time, brought under the notice of the Vestry and of the Sanitary Committee; but none of sufficient importance to necessitate any detailed mention of them here. The monthly analyses of the waters supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall, the Lambeth and the Kent Companies, I have continued to place before you periodically; and have appended them is a tabulated form to this report.—(see Table VIII.) The result has been still to shew the excellence of the quality of the water which they have severally furnished. 20 With many thanks, Gentlemen, as well for the assistance and encouragement afforded me in the performance of my duties, as for the personal kindness which I invariably receive from you, I beg to subscribe myself, sdgdfgYour obedient Servant, J.
