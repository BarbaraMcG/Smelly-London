STE 7 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst FOR THE Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. 1906. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH AND PUBLIC ANALYST, FOR THE YEAR 1906. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in submitting to you my sixth Annual Report, which deals with the Vital and Sanitary Statistics of the Borough of Stepney for the year 1906. Population. The population estimated to the middle of the year was 307,17(5, distributed as follows:— Limehouse District 58,538 St. George-in-the-East 51,075 Mile End Old Town 116,226 Whitechapel District 81,337 4 Births. the total number of births registered during the year was 10,668, which consisted of 5,464 males and 5,204 females. 1,893 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 32.3 per 1,000 of the population. 2,134 belonged to the St. George's District, or at the rate of 41.7 per 1,000 of the population. 4,122 belonged to the Mile End District, or at the rate of 36.4 per 1,000 of the population. 2,519 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 30.9 per 1,000 of the population. The birth-rate throughout the whole Borough was 34.7 per 1,000 of the population, whilst that of London as a whole was 26.5 per 1,000. The birth-rate in the Borough is slightly higher (T per 1,000) than in the previous year, while that of London is .6 per 1,000 less. It must however be borne in mind that the birth-rate in the Borough of Stepney was lower in 1905 than it had been on any previous occasion. The birth-rate is higher in the four Eastern Boroughs than in any of the others within the Metropolis; and the birth-rate in this Borough is the highest in London. The birth-rate of St. George's is higher than that of the other three districts, and is also slightly higher than in the preceding year. The birth-rate is higher than in the previous year in each of the four districts, with the exception of that of the Whitechapel District, where it is 1.5 per 1,000 less. The difference is more marked in Mile End Old Town with an excess of 2.4 per 1,000 as compared with the previous year. The birth-rate of St. George's is 15.2 per 1,000 higher than that of London as a whole. This is probably due—as I have pointed out on a former occasion—to the fact that the old residents in recent years have moved into the suburbs, and their houses have been taken by aliens, who are chiefly of the child-bearing age. Some of the old houses have been demolished and large dwellings have been erected instead. These model-dwellings are now almost entirely occupied by Jews. When old residents leave a neighbourhood and 5 their places are taken by young married people, the birth-rate must of necessity be above the average for some years. The larger the number of persons of the child-bearing period in a district, the greater will be the number of children born, and the higher will be the birth-rate. 181 births occurred in the London Hospital:— 42 belonged to Mile End Old Town. 20 belonged to St. George-in-the-East. 28 belonged to the Whitechapel District. 14 belonged to the Limehouse District. 77 belonged to outlying districts. 390 births occurred in the Mothers' Lying-in Home, Commercial Road:— 71 belonged to Mile End Old Town. 52 belonged to St. George-in-the-East. 16 belonged to the Whitechapel District. 83 belonged to the Limehouse District. 168 belonged to outlying districts. 91 births occurred in the Whitechapel Infirmary:— 60 belonged to the Whitechapel District. 5 belonged to Mile End Old Town. 3 belonged to the Limehouse District. 5 belonged to St. George-in-the-East. 18 belonged to outlying districts. 61 births occurred in St. George's Infirmary, all belonging to St. George's. 57 births occurred in the Mile End Infirmary:— 55 belonged to Mile End Old Town. 2 belonged to outlying districts. 6 births occurred in Poplar belonging to this Borough. All were children of residents of Limehouse. 1 birth belonging to Whitechapel occurred in the City of London Lying-in Home. Illegitimate Births. 19 illegitimate births were registered in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 10.1 per 1,000 births. 6 45 illegitimate births were registered in the St. George's District, or at the rate of 21.5 per 1,000 births. 59 illegitimate births were registered in the Mile End District or at the rate of 14.5 per 1,000 births. 37 illegitimate births were registered in the Whitechapel District or at the rate of 14.9 per 1,000 births. The number throughout the whole Borough was 160, or 28 less than in the previous year. This number corresponds to a rate of 15 per 1,000 births while that for the whole of London was 39 per 1,000. The number of illegitimate births was less in all the districts with the exception of St. George's, than in the preceding year. Marriages. The Marriages during the year numbered 2,760 or 28 more than in the previous year. The proportion of persons married was 17.9 per 1,000 of the population while that for the whole of London was 17.1 per 1,000. 386 marriages occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 13.1 persons married per 1,000 of the population. 266 marriages occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of 104 persons married per 1,000 of the population. 1,472 marriages occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of 25.3 persons married per 1,000 of the population. 636 marriages occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 15.6 persons married per 1,000 of the population. Deaths. The total number of deaths occurring in the Borough was - 5,871 Deduct deaths occurring within the Borough among persons not belonging thereto 1,202 4,669 Add deaths of residents that occurred outside the Borough - 766 5,435 7 The correct number of deaths, which include those of residents that occurred in Outlying Institutions, but exclusive of those of non-residents which occurred in Public Institutions situated in the Borough, was 5,435 or two more than in the preceding year. As the population is estimated to be greater than in the previous year, the death-rate per 1,000 is slightly less—17'6—. This is the lowest death-rate that I have a complete record of. 1,233 deaths belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 21.0 per 1,000. 976 deaths belonged to the St. George's District, or at the rate of 19.1 per 1,000. 1,921 deaths belonged to the Mile End District, or at the rate of 16.5 per 1,000. 1,305 deaths belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 16.0 per 1,000. The following table shows the death-rate throughout the whole Borough and in the various districts since 1890. Limehouse. St. George's Mile End. Whitechapel. The whole Borough. 1890 26.8 35.0 20.0 24.0 25.2 1891 26.0 29.1 21.2 24.7 24.4 1892 25.5 27.8 23.0 25.2 24.9 1893 27.7 31.0 22.8 25.0 25.5 1894 24.2 26.5 21.1 20.3 22.3 1895 27.3 29.5 22.5 22.8 24.0 1896 23.7 24.4 19.9 20.1 21.7 1897 25.1 26.4 18.7 19.7 21.4 1898 23.7 24.8 23.4 19.7 22.7 1899 25.5 27.1 20.3 19.3 22.0 1900 25.9 24.4 19.3 18.1 21 0 1901 24.6 23.0 18.5 19.3 20.8 1902 23.6 22.1 19.0 19.2 20.5 1903 19.7 20.3 16.3 17.5 17.9 1904 23.2 21.4 18.2 17.4 19.5 1905 20.3 20.4 16.9 15.4 17.7 1906 21.0 19.1 16.5 16.0 17.6 8 The most marked decrease has been in St. George's where the death-rate has never been below 20 per 1,000 on any previous occasion.

On Saturday, February 24th, I was asked to visit a suspicious case of Small Pox, at 85, Wilkes Street. Leah Myers, aged 20, had been taken ill on February 18th, the rash appearing on February 22nd. She had been vaccinated in infancy only. On making inquiries, and examining the rest of the family, I found that Joseph Myers, aged 23, was ill in bed. He was also suffering from Small Pox. The latter was taken ill on February 18th, the rash appearing on February 21st. He had been vaccinated in infancy only. Both were removed to the Hospital, and the rest of the family was taken to the Globe Road Shelter. The ground floor rooms are used as a provision shop, and, as Leah Myers had served in the shop, I took away and destroyed all articles in boxes and bottles which were open and partly used. The milk was poured down the drain. The rooms were fumigated, and a new padlock was put by us on the door of the shop. The shop was broken into by burglars on the following night, and goods to the value of nearly £2 were stolen, including 5s. in money. 14 On February 27th, Blumah Abrahams, aged 20, living at 89, Wilkes Street, was taken ill, and removed to the Fever Hospital on March 1st. She had been vaccinated in infancy. She visited Leah and Joseph Myers, at 85, Wilkes Street, on February 22nd. It is probable that the source of infection was the same in the three cases, but I was unable to trace its origin definitely. About a fortnight previous to their being taken ill, they went to a wedding party in Hackney. No illness of a suspicious character had occurred at the house they visited, but cases of Small Pox had been notified in the immediate neighbourhood. As the party was a large one, and had taken place about three weeks previously, it was impracticable to obtain a complete list of the guests, but it can only be assumed that some of them had been in contact with the Small Pox cases notified in Hackney. On March 3rd another case occurred at 85, Wilkes Street (E. L., aged 34), and was removed to the Small Pox Hospital on the same day. He had been vaccinated in infancy. 85, Wilkes Street is a four-storeyed house let out in tenements, each floor accommodating two families. Altogether 25 persons lived in the house. In these circumstances it is satisfactory to know that no further cases occurred in the district. Measles. The number of deaths from Measles was 178, or 27 more than in the previous year. 63 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 1.07 per 1,000 of the population. 20 belonged to the St. George's District, or at the rate of .39 per 1,000 of the population. 57 belonged to the Mile End District, or at the rate of .49 per 1,000 of the population. 38 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of '46 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate for the whole Borough was at the rate of .57 per 1,000 The death-rate for the whole of London was .41 per 1,000. 15 The number of deaths from Measles in the Borough since 1901 was as follows:— 1901 155 1902 158 1903 162 1904 176 1905 151 1906 171 Ignorance on the part of Mothers of the seriousness of the disease, is probably the principal factor in the high mortality from Measles. They fail to recognise the fact that children suffering from Measles are very liable to complications, such as Broncho-Pneumonia, which is possibly the most frequent secondary cause of death. It is thought that Measles is such a trivial disease, that the sooner the child gets it, the better it is for him and all concerned. Whereas it is an admitted fact, that beyond the age of two years, the older the child becomes, the less liable he is to the disease; and if contracted, children over 5 years of age rarely succumb. In 1903, the London County Council made an order that all the sections of the Public Health Act 1891, relating to Notifiable diseases should apply to Measles, with the exception of that section, which would make it obligatory on the nearest relative, or the Doctor in attendance, to notify the patient so suffering to the Public Health Authorities. This Order was approved by the Local Government Board, and came into force on April 1st of that year. A person is liable to heavy penalties if he exposes infected clothing, or allows a person suffering from Measles, whilst under his charge, to be in a public place. The premises must be disinfected when the patient has recovered from Measles, and is presumably free from infection. It was assumed by the London County Council that information would be given to us by the School Authorities, as well as by the parents themselves. It is true we receive information from teachers that certain children are absent from school, and that such children are supposed to be suffering from Measles. On making inquiries, I find that as a rule the teachers' notifications are based upon the report of the School Attendance Officer, or upon the information given by children in the same house, or neighbouring houses. To that extent the information is unreliable. When visits are made by officials of the Sanitary Authority for the purpose of enforcing isolation and disinfection the mothers of the children in question deny the statement made to us by the teachers. They usually state that the patients had suffered from an illness other than Measles, and pointed to the children as being quite well at the time of the visit. 16 Unreliable as the information from the school teachers is, it is rendered even of less value from the fact that the child has been absent from school for a considerable time, when the inquiries by the Sanitary Officials are made. In some cases we are able to persuade the parents that the disease may have been Measles, and it is to the interest of the other children that the premises should be disinfected. In such circumstances it would be useless to attempt to insist upon the premises being disinfected, if the parents refuse to have it done. If we took police court proceedings, we would not be able to controvert the evidence of the parents that the child had not suffered from Measles, and the Magistrate would dismiss the case. If the teachers refused to accept any excuse as to the child's absence from school, except a written one, it would be more difficult for the parents to afterwards deny the existence of the disease. During the School Holidays, we are without even this meagre information. For the above reasons alone, the order of the London County Council is in my opinion of no practical value, and taking the table on page 15 into consideration, it must be admitted that it has as yet, shown no tendency to lessen the incidence of the disease in the Borough. It is not my intention at the present time, to discuss the advantages or disadvantages which might accrue from the Order, even in the absence of the conditions mentioned in the above paragraph. It would, of course, be expensive to make Measles a notifiable disease, and it is doubtful whether the expenditure would be justified if adopted. It is true that it has been tried in many of the large provincial towns, but the conditions are somewhat different. In all the places where the experiment has been made, a certain number of patients at the onset of an epidemic, were removed to the Fever Hospitals. During the height of the epidemics the hospital accommodation was found to be inadequate. The Metropolitan Asylums Board however do not admit patients to their Fever Hospitals, if they are known to be suff< ring from Measles. In considering the question of expense, the amount now paid to Medical Men for notifying infectious diseases would be doubled. This would be a small matter compared to the sum that would be necessary to provide sufficient hospital accommodation. Even with a sufficient number of Fever Hospitals, we could not expect to have the same good results with respect to 17 Measles, as we have in the other notifiable diseases. The childen that contract Measles are generally younger than those who suffer from Scarlet Fever. Twenty-five per cent, of the children that died last year from Measles in this Borough were under 1 year of age. Ninety per cent of the remainder were between one and two years of age. The majority of the children that died from Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria were between two and five years of age, and sixteen per cent were above five years of age. The objection to removing children under a twelve-month old, or even under two yrears of age, to a Fever Hospital is obvious. Measles differs from other notifiable diseases in the fact that it is very infectious before the rash appears, and days before the disease can be recognised with any certainty. The removal of children suffering from Measles to Fever Hospitals being thus out of the question, it may be asked whether notification without subsequent removal would be of any benefit. In the year 1906, 94 per cent, of the Scarlet Fever cases, and 93 per cent, of the Diphtheria cases were removed to the Fever Hospitals, because it was found impossible to have them properly isolated at their own homes. This also proves that it would be equally impracticable to isolate children suffering from Measles at home. By means of notification we would certainly receive information where the first cases occur. The inspection of the premises and the isolation of the patient, if possible, with full instructions as to the prevention of its spreading to other children, would be of some value. Periodic visits to see that these instructions are being obeyed, would tend to an increased appreciation of the serious nature of the disease, and thus to prevent its spreading. The parents could at the same time be warned of the danger of pulmonary complications, which are co frequently fatal. The compulsory notification of Measles, has, as yet, been tried in only a few towns, of which Aberdeen is one. There was continuous notification in Aberdeen from 1881 to 1903. It was withdrawn in the latter year, as experience appeared to show that the benefits scarcely justified the large cost. It was found that the great bulk of children contracted Measles before the completion of their eighth year. It is therefore needless in a threatened epidemic of Measles to close schools in so far as children above eight years are concerned. The prevalence of Measles increased considerably during the last ten years of the above-mentioned period (1892 to 1902), but this was probably due to increased efficiency in notification. B 18 Scarlet Fever. 1,123 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified, of which 1,060 were removed to the various Fever Hospitals. 199 occurred in the Limehouse District with 7 deaths. 163 occurred in the St. George's District with 8 deaths. 455 occurred in the Mile End District with 10 deaths. 306 occurred in the Whitechapel District with 13 deaths. The death-rate for the whole Borough was T2 per 1,000 while that for the whole of London was T1 per 1,000. Whooping Cough. The number of deaths from Whooping Cough was 99, or 24 less than in the previous year. This corresponds to a death-rate of .32 per 1,000 of the population. 23 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .39 per 1000. 28 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of .54 per 1,000. 30 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of .25 per 1,000. 18 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .22 per 1,000. The death-rate throughout London was .26 per 1,000. Diphtheria. 513 cases were notified during the year, and 477 were removed to the Fever Hospitals. 136 cases belonged to the Limehouse District with 15 deaths, which is equivalent to a death-rate of .25 per 1,000 of the population. 76 cases belonged to the St. George's District with 12 deaths, which is equivalent to a death-rate of .23 per 1,000 of the population. 195 cases belonged to Mile End Old Town with 24 deaths, which is equivalent to a death-rate of .20 per 1,000 of the population. 19 106 cases belonged to the Whitechapel District, with 12 deaths, which is equivalent to a death-rate of .14 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate throughout the Borough was .20 per 1,000 of the population, which is exactly the same rate as in the previous year. The death-rate for the whole of London was '15 per 1,000, or slightly higher than in the previous year. Wrong Diagnosis.—In addition to the above, 82 cases of Diphtheria—:Or 13.7 per cent, of the total—were notified, which on being removed to the Fever Hospital were found not to be so suffering. The Antitoxin treatment of Diphtheria has reduced the mortality from this disease by about 60 per cent, during recent years. The efficacy of the treatment depends on the early application of the Antitoxin. At the Brook Fever Hospital during the years 1897-1906, 235 cases were treated on the first day of the disease, and not a single death occurred, whereas there died of 1,441 cases treated on the second day 4.30 per cent.; of 1,600 cases treated on the third day 11T2 per cent.; of 1,276 cases treated on the fourth day 17.24 per cent.; and of 1,645 cases treated on the fifth day 18.72 per cent. Croup. Three cases of Membranous Croup were notified during the year and all were treated at their own homes. 2 belonged to Mile End and 1 to the Whitechapel District. There were in addition to the above, 4 deaths from Spurious Croup or Laryngismus Stridulus, 1 belonging to Limehouse, 2 to St. George's and 1 to Mile End. Enteric Fever. 119 cases of Enteric Fever were notified during the year, or 2 more than in the previous year. Twenty were treated at their own homes. 34 cases occurred in the Limehouse District with 7 deaths. 29 cases occurred in St. George's with 3 deaths. 27 cases occurred in Mile End with 7 deaths. 29 cases occurred in the Whitechapel District with 7 deaths. B 2 20 The death-rate throughout the Borough was .07 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate in the whole of London was .06 per 1,000. Typhus Fever. One case of Typhus Fever was notified from the Whitechapel District. The patient recovered. Erysipelas. 410 cases were notified and 72 were removed to various Hospitals and Infirmaries. 62 occurred in the Limehouse District. Three died. 82 occurred in St. George's. Two died. 126 occurred in Mile End. Five died. 140 occurred in the Whitechapel District. All recovered. Erysipelas is not regarded by the public generally, nor by the majority of general practitioners as a disease which is liable to be spread by personal contact. It is doubtful whether a number of the cases notified as such, can be considered as Erysipelas. It used to be a common occurrence in this Borough to see a person notified as Erysipelas walking in the street, a day or two after the date on the certificate. I have recently insisted on every case being isolated, and the premises afterwards disinfected. These were 94 fewer cases notified in 1906 than in the previous year, In a number of Metropolitan Boroughs the premises are not disinfected after Erysipelas. It is a common occurrence to receive a second certificate from another practitioner notifying the same case of Erysipelas. On one occasion in May last, I received four notifications from four Medical men within two days referring to the same case. The first notification was received from the Lock Hospital. After being returned home in an ambulance, the patient went to the London Hospital. The medical attendant at the hospital notified the case, but did not admit him to the wards. On the following day, the parish Doctor notified the case and removed him to the Infirmary. He was finally notified on the same day by the Medical Superintendent on being admitted to the St. George's Infirmary. 21 The Public Health Committee recommended the Council to ask the Local Government Board to promote legislation to amend the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, by removing Erysipelas from the list of Notifiable diseases. The other Metropolitan Councils were invited to send a similar recom. mendation to the Local Government Board. Five agreed with the Stepney Council and decided to do so, six disagreed with us, seven decided to take no action and three thought the notification of Erysipelas might be useful in other respects. Diarrhoea. The number of deaths from Diarrhcea, which includes Epidemic and Zymotic Enteritis, Dysentery and Dysenteric Diarrhoea, Cholera and Choleraic Diarrhoea, was 318. Of these 225 were infants under one year of age. 92 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 1.55 per 1,000. 71 belonged to St. George's, or at the rate of 1.39 per 1,000. 112 belonged to Mile End, or at the rate of .96 per 1,000. 43 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .52 per 1,000. The death rate for the whole of the Borough was 1.03 per 1,000. The death rate for the whole of London was .94 per 1,000. Enteritis. The number of deaths from enteritis, which includes Gastro-Enteritis, Muco-Enteritis, and Gastric Catarrh, was 257. Of this number, 220 were infants under one year of age. 52 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .88 per 1,000. 61 belonged to St. George's, or at the rate of 1.19 per 1,000. 84 belonged to Mile End, or at the rate of .72 per 1,000. 60 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .74 per 1,000. The total death rate from Enteritis through the whole Borough was .83 per 1,000 of the population. Puerperal Fever. Six cases of Puerperal Fever were notified and 3 proved fatal. 1 belonged to St. George's, which proved fatal. 2 belonged to Mile End, and one proved fatal. 3 belonged to Whitechapel, and one proved fatal.

The total deaths from diseases of a Zymotic character numbered 729. This number corresponds to a death rate of 2.37 per 1,000 of the population. It includes deaths from Small Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Croup, Enteric Fever, Puerperal Fever, and Diarrhoea. 209 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 3.57 per 1,000. 146 belonged to St. George's, or at the rate of 2.85 per 1,000. 242 belonged to Mile End, or at the rate of 2.08 per 1,000. 132 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of l.62 per 1,000. Diseases of Respiratory Organs. There were 1056 deaths due to diseases of the Respiratory Organs, which corresponds to a death rate of 3.43 per 1,000 of the population. 204 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 3.46 per 1,000. 202 belonged to St. George's, or at the rate of 3.95 per 1,000. 376 belonged to Mile End, or at the rate of 3.23 per 1,000. 274 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 3.36 per 1,000. Infantile Mortality. 1,454 infants died under one year of age, which corresponds to a death rate of 136 per 1,000 births. This number is 48 less than in the previous year, when the death rate was 142 per 1,000 births. 319 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 168 per 1,000 births. 301 belonged to St. George's, or at the rate of 141 per 1,000 births. 522 belonged to Mile End, or at the rate of 126 per 1,000 births. 312 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 123 per 1,000 births. The infantile mortality is again the lowest of the four Boroughs in the eastern portion of the Metropolis. The infantile mortality is lower than in the previous year, although it was higher in two of the districts comprising the Borough, viz., Limehouse and Whitechapel. 23 Table showing infantile mortality from 1899 to 1906:— Limehouse District.

The number of deaths due to Alcoholism and Cirrhosis of the Liver was 72, or 8 more than in the previous year. 19 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .32 per 1,000. 6 belonged to St. George's, or at the rate of .11 per 1,000. 30 belonged to Mile End, or at the rate of .25 per 1,000. 17 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .20 per 1,000. The death-rate throughout the Borough was at the rate of .23 per 1,000 of the population. Cancer. The number of deaths from Cancer was 263, or 35 more than in the previous year. 62 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 1.05 per 1,000. 42 belonged to St. George's, or at the rate of .82 per 1,000. 104 belonged to Mile End, or at the rate of .89 per 1,000. 55 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .67 per 1,000. The number of deaths from Cancer increases steadily from year to year This is true of other districts as well as our own. 25 The following table gives the number of deaths since 1901 in the Borough of Stepney:— 1901 211 deaths 1902 201 99 1903 223 99 1904 240 99 1905 228 99 1906 263 99 The deaths in 1906 consist of 128 males and 135 females. As the relationship of males and females differ in various parts of the Borough it may be of interest to give the numbers of the four Districts :— Males. Females. Limehouse District 40 22 St. George's 28 14 Mile End 33 71 Whitechapel District 27 28 Notifiable Diseases. 2,179 cases of Infectious Diseases were notified during the year, and 1,716 were removed to various Hospitals and Infirmaries. 431 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 7.36 per 1,000. 351 belonged to St. George's, or at the rate of 6.87 per 1,000. 807 belonged to Mile End, or at the rate of 6.94 per 1,000. 590 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 7.25 per 1,000. The number of Notifiable Diseases was 778 less than in the previous year. The greatest number occurred, as in the previous year, during the month of September, with this difference that in 1906 it reached its height in the second week, whereas in 1905 it was not at its maximum until the fourth week. The greatest number notified in one week was 70, which included 44 Scarlet Fever cases. This number was nearly reached on two other occasions, viz., the last week in June and the last week in October when 68 cases were notified. No Typhoid Fever cases were reported during the last week in August and the first week in September, but afterwards the number rose, and reached its maximum in the last week of October. 26 From the fourth week in September until the end of the third week of December, 65 cases of Typhoid Fever were notified out of a total number of 119 notified throughout the year. 20 cases of Diphtheria were the largest number notified in one week, but this number was reached on two occasions, viz., the last week of June and the last week of July. The largest number of Notifiable Diseases occurred during the last week of June in Limehouse and St. George's; the second week in June in Mile End and the second week in September in the Whitechapel District. In addition to the above, there were 154 cases—or 6.6 per cent. of the total notified,—which on being removed to Fever Hospitals, were found not to be suffering from the disease mentioned in the Medical certificates. This number was made up of the following:— Scarlet Fever 68 Diphtheria 82 Enteric Fever 4 Phthisis. 526 deaths occurred during the year from Phthisis. This corresponds to a death rate of 1.71 per 1,000 of the population. The death rate throughout the whole of London was 1.44 per 1,000. 116 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 1.98 per 1,000. 94 belonged to St. Georges, or at the rate of 1.84 per 1,000. 178 belonged to Mile End, or at the rate of 1.53 per 1,000. 138 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 1.69 per 1,000. Of this number, 60 per cent. died in various Institutions, such as Infirmaries, &c. This is of importance as it indicates that this percentage of persons during the later stages of the disease are taken away from their homes, and placed under better conditions, with advantage to themselves, as well as to the rest of the family. 27 The deaths occurred as follows:— At their own homes. In Public Institutions. Limehouse District 64 52 St. George’s 37 57 Mile End 82 96 Whitechapel District 27 111 106 specimens of Sputum were examined bacteriologically during the year at the request of Poor Law Medical Officers and Officials of the Jewish Board of Guardians. Tubercle bacilli were found to be present in 15 only. Other Tubercular Diseases. In addition to the above, there were 214 deaths from Tubercular Diseases other than Phthisis. This corresponds to a death rate of .69 per 1,000 of the population. 57 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .97 per 1,000. 47 belonged to St. Georges, or at the rate of .92 per 1,000. 53 belonged to Mile End, or at the rate of .45 per 1,000. 57 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .70 per 1,000. From the above it will be seen that 13.6 per cent. of all deaths during the year are due to diseases of a Tubercular Nature. The question of making Phthsis a notifiable disease was discussed on several occasions by the Public Health Committee and the matter was ultimately referred to a Sub-Committee together with communications that had been received from the following authorities:— (1) The London County Council. (2) „ Finsbury Borough Council. (3) ,, Woolwich Borough Council. (4) ,, National Association for the Prevention of Consumption. The following report was submitted by the Public Health Committee to the Council:— (1) The Clerk of the London County Council, in his communication intimates that the Public Health Committee of the London County Council have under consideration a report by their Medical Officer of Health on the matter (a copy of which has been supplied to each member of the Public Health 28 Committee). In this report the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council points out that in 18 districts of London including the City, a system of voluntary notification is in vogue, and he suggests that this system should be adopted in the remaining 11 districts. He also makes what we consider to be a valuable suggestion, viz.:—that the authorities of Metropolitan hospitals and dispensaries should be invited to send him notice of the names and addresses of phthisical patients attending their institutions and that he should transmit this information to the Medical Officers of Health of the several Metropolitan Sanitary Authorities. The Public Health Committee of the London County Council ask whether this Council is of opinion (a) That phthisis should be declared under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to be a notifiable infectious disease, or (b) That the system of voluntary notification of the disease should be adopted throughout London, and that particulars as to out-patients attending Metropolitan hospitals and dispensaries should be obtained and circulated in the manner referred to. (2) The Finsbury Borough Council have passed a resolution directing the attention of the Local Government Board to the desirability of legislation being promoted to provide for the compulsory isolation or removal of advanced cases of phthisis, and ask this Council to take similar action. (3) The Woolwich Borough Council in their communication inform this Council that voluntary notification has been in existence in their Borough for some time, with a decided benefit, but such benefit is limited, and many medical practitioners do not notify such cases without the consent of their patients. That Council also points out that the London County Council has the power with the sanction of the Local Government Board to make phthisis a compulsory notifiable disease, and that as it is only suggested to apply the notification sections of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, there would be no interference with the movements of the patient, and they have asked the London County Council to take this course and suggest that this Council should make a similar request. (4) The National Association for the Prevention of Consumption send a circular pointing out how Consumption can and should be dealt with, by organised and co-ordinated effort on the part of Public Authorities and we have asked that Association to supply a copy of this circular to each member of the Council. 29 We would remind the Committee of our report submitted to and adopted by the Council on the 2nd August, 1905, in which we reported that we recognised that the ultimate ideal should be (a) That pulmonary phthisis should be notifiable, and (b) That patients should be segregated for treatment, and (c) That after death or removal the rooms of phthisical patients should be disinfected. We stated, however, that it was futile to deal with this matter by means of mere voluntary action. As an immediate expedient we advised the issue of pamphlets containing instructions to patients and friends for distribution in the Borough, and these pamphlets have been widely distributed, and such distribution is being continued. It has for some time past been the Committee's practice to disinfect rooms occupied by phthisical persons after death or removal, when permission is granted for this purpose. Upon the subject of voluntary notification we are still unable to see our way to recommend the Council to adopt such a course, as we do not think from the result of enquiries we made last year as to the working of this system in other districts, that the expenditure involved would be justified by the results which would accrue. Advanced cases are found to be notified again and again by different medical practitioners, whereas the early and probably curable cases are seldom notified unless the consent of the patient is given, and this is often withheld. Many of the following reasons which we urge against the compulsory notification of phthisis are equally applicable to voluntary notification. With regard to the suggestion of making phthisis a notifiable disease under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, we are of opinion that the time is by no means ripe for this to be done. Notification is, we think useless, unless followed up in a practical manner by isolation and disinfection. We do not think that under the present circumstances the ratepayers should be called upon to find the enormous funds which would be necessary to provide institutions for the reception of phthisical patients of the poorer classes who are in the early stages of the disease, and we think that such cases must be left to the present voluntary hospitals and sanatoria. Again such patients are often able to support themselves and persons dependent upon them by their own earnings and it does not appear to us to be hygienically necessary or 30 nomically desirable, to compulsorily deprive such persons of opportunities for gaining a livelihood, always provided that they take proper precautions against spreading infection. We are, however, of opinion that for advanced cases publicly managed institutions with power to detain patients should be established. These cases are not generally dealt with at the Poor Law Infirmaries on account of the disinclination of the patients to enter such institutions, and unless these establishments have special facilities for dealing with this disease, we do not think them suitable places for consumptive persons. The special hospitals also do not seem to welcome advanced cases for treatment as in-patients, their energies being mainly confined to those cases which they are of opinion they can cure or materially benefit. The course which it appears to us should betaken is that contained in one of the suggestions of the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council. This suggestion is that the London County Council should ask the authorities of all Metropolitan Hospitals and Dispensaries to send lists of the names and addresses of all phthisical patients attending such institutions to the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council, who should ascertain the districts in which such patients reside, and send particulars to the Medical Officer of Health of such districts. It appears to us that it would be convenient that such lists should be sent to the London County Council as the information and clerical staff at the disposal of the hospital authorities (who treat cases from all parts) would be insufficient to enable them accurately to decide the respective Metropolitan Boroughs in which their patients reside and to act accordingly. When the information is received by the Medical Officer of Health of Stepney, we propose that the patient's home should be visited by a Sanitary Inspector, a printed list of instructions for patients and friends left on the premises, disinfection should, where permission is given, be carried out if necessary, and always in the event of a patient's death or removal, and that particulars of the case should be given to such voluntary societies as exist in the Borough for dealing with the prevention of consumption. Before submitting our recommendations we desire to express our thanks to Miss Blewitt, one of the lady health visitors of the Board of Guardians for the Jewish Poor, who with the consent of the Board kindly attended our meeting and gave us the benefit of her practical experience in connection with the Board's efforts to combat the spread of this disease. 31 Our conclusions on the whole matter in the light of the present correspondence, and of our general experience since we issued our previous report are shortly set out in the following recommendations. 1. That the London Connty Council should be informed that this Council continues in its opinion expressed in August, 1905, that it would be undesirable to adopt a system of voluntary notification of phthisis, and believes that it would be inexpedient at the present time to add this disease to the list of compulsorily notifiable diseases specified in the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. 2. That the London County Council be requested to invite the Authorites of Metropolitan hospitals and dispensaries to give to the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council notice of the names and addresses of patients suffering from pulmonary phthisis attending such institutions with a view to the transmission of this information to the Medical Officers of Health of the several Metropolitan sanitary authorities. 3. That this Council do agree with the resolution of the Finsbury Borough Council directing the attention of the Local Government Board to the desirability of legislation being promoted to provide for the compulsory segregation of advanced cases of phthisis. 4. That the Medical Officer of Health be instructed to draft posters and handbills for distribution in workshops and factories in the Borough of Stepney with reference to the danger arising from spitting on the floors. 5. That this report be printed and copies sent to the following:— The Local Government Board. The London County Council. The Metropolitan Asylums Board. The Metropolitan Borough Councils. The Metropolitan Boards of Guardians. The Town Councils and Boards of Guardians of " Greater London." The Jewish Board of Guardians. The National Association for the Prevention of Consumption. The Members representing Stepney in Parliament, on the London County Council and on the Metropolitan Asylums Board. The Metropolitan Hospitals for Chest Diseases. The Borough Council approved of this Report at a meeting held on March 28th. Homeless. 76 deaths of persons without a permanent address occurred in the Whitechapel Infirmary, 13 at the Mile End Infirmary, 5 at the St. George s Infirmary, 20 occurred at the Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum and Stepney 32 Workhouse which were stated to belong to the Limehouse District. They were described as homeless and their deaths were included in the District where they occurred. This number does not include the deaths of persons admitted from Common Lodging Houses, nor does it include those deaths at various Lunatic Asylums where no addresses could be given. 64 such deaths occurred at the latter Institutions, 6 stated to have been previously removed from the Limehouse District, 7 were said to have belonged to StGeorge's, 26 to Mile End Old Town, and 25 to the Whitechapel District. Appendicitis. 16 deaths occurred during the year from appendicitis. 4 belonged to the Limehouse district. 3 belonged to St George's. 6 belonged to Mile End Old Town. 3 belonged to the Whitechapel District. Cerebro-Spinal Fever. This disease in an epidemic form is rare in this country. Recently the disease has spread rapidly in certain parts of Ireland. At the time of writing, the disease has been made a notifiable one, and any signs of its spreading will be immediately detected. In 1906 there were 10 deaths from this disease, 6 belonged to the Limehouse District, 2 belonged to St. George's, and 2 belonged to Mile End Old Town. Beri Beri. One case of Beri Beri occurred in the Borough during the year. A Chinaman arrived from Hong Kong on February 5th and slept at 8 Limehouse Causeway, which is a registered lodging house for seamen. He complained of being ill previous to landing from the ship, and was afterwards found to be suffering from Beri Beri. The premises were disinfected and the other inmates were kept under observation, but no further cases occurred. 33 c NUMBER OF ARTICLES DISINFECTED IN THE DISINFECTING APPARATUS. articles disinfected January.

The Number of bodies deposited in the Mortuary during the year was 778. Of these, 699 were removed by the Coroner, 59 by the Police, 3 by Relieving Officers, 10 at the request of friends of the deceased and 7 on my instructions. Eight of the bodies were persons who had died from Infectious diseases, and were placed in the Infectious Mortuary. Three bodies were placed in the Jewish part of the Mortuary. 754 inquests were held in the Coroner's Court, and 86 post-mortem examinations were made. Canal Boats Acts 1877 and 1884. Pursuant to the third Section of the Canal Boats Act, 1884, the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney, being the registration authority under the above Acts, have to report as follows, with regard to the execution of such Acts and of the Regulations made thereunder, and as to the steps taken by them as such Authority during the year 1906 to give effect to the provisions of the said Acts and Regulations, viz.:— 1. Canal Boats coming within the district are inspected by a Sanitary Inspector, who receives a sum of £10 per annum for the performance of this duty. His inspection is irrespective of the examination of boats made by me as Examining Officer prior to their registration. 2. The number of boats inspected in 1906 was 22: the condition of the boats and their occupants as regards the matters dealt with in the Acts and Regulations was very good. 35 3. Infringements of the Acts and Regulations were discovered as follows, viz.:— (a) Registration Nil. (b) Notification of change of Master Nil. (c) Certificates Nil. (d) Marking Nil. (e) Overcrowding Nil. (/) Separation of Sexes Nil. (g) Cleanliness Nil. (h) Ventilation Nil. (i) Painting Two. (j) Provision of Water Cask Nil. (k) Removal of Bilge Water Nil. (/) Notification of Infectious Diseases Nil. (m) Admittance of Inspector Nil. (n) Cabin roof not weatherproof One. 4. No legal proceedings were taken. 5. In the case of the above infringements, notices were sent to the Owners of the Boats, requiring them to remedy the cause of complaint and to forward within a specified period certificates signed by some duly appointed Inspector of Canal Boats, that the same had been duly done, and such certificates were afterwards received. 6. No case of Infectious Disease occurred. 7. No Boats were detained for cleansing and disinfection. 8. The number of Boats on the Register on the 31st December, 1906, was 69. 9. No Boats were registered in 1906. Two children only were found on the boats. Examination of Food. Possibly no subject has created more attention during the year than the question of the examination of food generally, and canned food in particular. It is not necessary to believe entirely the sensational statements made in a recently published book, nor is it essential that we should turn a deaf ear to c 2 36 all denials of the Beef Trust, and still feel convinced that the conditions under which the packing industry was carried on in Chicago, were not only unsatisfactory, but in some respects revolting in the extreme. More convincing than the statements in the book concerning the utilization of diseased carcases, as well as putrid and decomposing meat, were the strenuous efforts made by the trust magnates to prevent an efficient inspection. Pood is imported into London from all countries, and the responsibility of inspection is divided between various authorities. The Port of London Sanitary Authority exercises jurisdiction over the stream of the Thames, and also over the area within the dock gates, including dock-wharves and buildings. The Corporation of London and the Borough Councils exercise a similar jurisdiction over wharves that abut on the banks of the river but are outside the docks. The Port of London Sanitary Authority have three Inspectors whose duties consist solely in the examination of food. In the City of London, the food on the wharves is examined by food inspectors, but these do not devote their whole time to this particular kind of examination. The Council of Borough of Stepney have appointed a Wharf Inspector, whose sole duty consists of inspecting food landed on the wharves. In the other Boroughs which exercise jurisdiction the district inspectors do the inspection. All the inspectors carry out their work under control of their respective Medical Officers of Health. In 1903 complaints were made by the London and India Docks Company as to the want of uniformity and equality in the methods adopted for the inspection of Food. It was contended "that the inspection of food landed at the docks was of one class, while the remainder of the Port of London which was under the control of the Borough Councils had insisted on a less stringent examination." As a result of these representations, a Local Government Board Inquiry was held at the Guildhall in April, 1903. An exhaustive examination was made into the methods of Inspection which took place at the various points of landing, and the Local Government Board, on the report of its Commissioner, 37 Came to the conclusion that the Borough Councils had not neglected their duty as to the inspection of food landed at the wharves, and refused to acquiesce in the recommendation of the Dock Company, to have all the wharves transferred so as to bring them under the supervision of the Port of London Sanitary Authority. Evidence was given at the above inquiry on behalf of most of the riverside districts in London, and it may be fairly assumed that the method adopted is almost similar in all cases. The examination may be slightly more stringent in some districts than in others, but this depends more upon the individual official than upon the system. The Borough of Stepney contains about 2¼ miles of river frontage, and includes more wharves where food is landed, than any other Metropolitan Borough. Upon the arrival of any vessel off Gravesend, its name is entered at the Custom House, when a declaration is made of the cargo brought by such vessel. The information thus obtained is printed, and circulated by the Statistical Department of the Custom House. Each evening a report, known by the name " Bill A " is issued, and this comprises all the entries at the Custom House up to 4 p.m. every day. Arrangements are made by which a copy of this report is posted every night to the food inspector, so that by the first post in the morning he has before him a list of arrivals, and approximately a description of the cargo of all the vessels that had arrived on the previous day. In the warehouse at the Docks, and on the wharves, the Customs Authorities have the power to make a ten per cent. examination, and the food inspector endeavours to be present at this examination in order to save the expense and loss of time, which would be incurred by a double examination. If, however, the inspector has reason to believe from their general appearance, or from any other cause, that the goods are unsound, he does not wait for the Customs examination, but proceeds with his own inspection, in order to form an opinion as to their probable condition. For their own protection, the importers also make an examination. If the inspector has reason to believe that there is a large quantity of “blown tins” in the consignment, he demands that each tin shall be examined separately. This examination is then done by an experienced person in the employ of the owner or his agents, and under the supervision of the food 38 inspector. All unsound canned goods are put on one side and subsequently destroyed. The tins are afterwards spiked to render it impossible to use them for human food. This examination is not confined to foodstuffs recently landed. The food inspector periodically goes through the wharf warehouses, and if any of the stored goods are suspected to be unsound, they are examined. In this way canned goods that have possibly been on the wharves for years are subjected to the ordinary examination which is carried out on landing. Some of the tins are taken for the purpose of making a chemical examination of their contents. This examination and its results is dealt with in detail in another report which was submitted to the Public Health Committee in June last. The latter report however does not contain much reference to frozen meat. The amount landed this year on the wharves is less than in previous years. A large percentage of meat sold in butchers shops is foreign stuff. The trade in frozen meat has of recent years attained enormous dimensions. Various causes have contributed to this result, but the improved methods adopted, together with the increased facilities of transit, are among the most important factors. There are several ways of preserving meat by means of low temperatures. In the first method, the carcase is exposed to a temperature at, or below the freezing point of water, whilst in another method the meat is kept at a temperature somewhat above 0°C. It is not an easy matter for an untrained person to distinguish frozen or refrigerated meat from fresh meat, when the former has been thawed, and is exposed in the shops for sale. Certain changes take place which render its detection possible. In refrigerated meat the fat is pink owing to the stain of the lean meat which escapes. The outside portion will present a " dead " appearance when compared with the lustre seen on the outside of good fresh meat. The dressing also is not so clean and neat as in English dressed meat. The vertebrae or bones of the back are usually sawn, and not chopped through. The hindquarter usually contains three ribs instead of one, the forequarter being shortened proportionately. 39 In frozen meat, the fat is of a deadly white colour. The flesh has a uniform pink appearance owing to diffusion of the colouring matter of the blood. The outside part has a wet, par-boiled appearance, and there is oozing, as well as dripping of liquid from the meat. On landing, a similar system of examination is adopted as was described in the inspection of canned food. If any unsound or diseased carcases are found, they are at once destroyed; but it is often most difficult to state whether these carcases are diseased or not. The lungs, liver, and other organs have been removed, and the signs of disease may be apparent in these organs alone, though possibly the whole carcase may be unfit for human consumption. In some instances, it is almost impossible to express an opinion as to the healthiness of a carcase unless one is present at the slaughtering and dressing, and this constitutes an objection to frozen meat. Otherwise meat may be kept indefinitely by freezing. It is true that the cold does not always kill the micro-organisms. Putrefactive bacteria possess an unusual resisting power against low temperatures, but this resistance does not in any way militate against the preservative effect of the cold. Though the putrefactive bacteria are not destroyed by cold, yet the low temperature prevents their multiplication, and in this dormant condition the development of their action is prevented. Frozen meat though, may possess one obvious disadvantage. In the process of thawing, water vapour and putrefactive bacteria may be deposited upon the surface of the meat, and thereby greatly affect its capacity for keeping sweet. Though some butchers assert, that on a sultry day, frozen meat will keep sweeter than fresh meat when exposed to similar conditions; this is generally recognised to be a fallacy. When frozen meat is thawed, and exposed on a hot day in the window, or on a board in front of a shop, it soon becomes tainted. Fortunately, in most instances, frozen meat is not kept long after it has been thawed. It is sold in shops, whose motto is "quick returns and small profits." At its best, it is sold very cheaply, and when it has become slightly tainted, it is sold at such a low price as to tempt poor people to invest. Most meat of this description is usually sold on Saturdays ; if not disposed of on Saturday nights and the shop is not opened on Sunday mornings, it is consigned to a place of business situated in a poor neighbourhood where a large trade is done on the latter day. In streets known as market streets, it is no infrequent sight for the owner of frozen meat to sell a large quantity " for what it will fetch." Unfortunately, the whole of the meat may not be disposed of in any of these ways, and then commences the slippery slope which leads to the factory of the less reputable of canned meat manu- 40 facturers and manufacturers of sausages. By many a crooked path the carcase may find its way into the canning or mincing room. The tainted meat may then either be canned or minced and converted into sausages. If intended for sausages a colouring matter is frequently added to give it a fresh appearance. Oxide of Iron or some of the aniline dyes are most commonly used under some fancy name for this purpose. Spices and sweet herbs are also added in such large quantities, that the tainted smell and taste are disguised, and it is impossible to state whether the meat is unfit to eat or not. Though the unwholesome character of the meat is thus masked, it does not follow that it has been rendered wholesome. On the contrary, its consumption may be followed by disastrous results. It may be argued that such meat should be seized, but Inspectors are very chary of taking minced meat before a Magistrate for an order to destroy. The Magistrate has to satisfy himself that the food submitted is unfit for human consumption. The only means for detection at his disposal are the sense of smell, and the sense of sight. The addition of the ingredients mentioned above will very effectually disguise the usual appearance and smell of tainted meat, and on that account the Magistrate will possibly refuse an order to have it condemned. He may believe all that is told him by the Sanitary Officer, but as the Law requires the Magistrate to be satisfied that it is unwholesome, and as he cannot see or smell anything wrong with it, owing to its disguise, he may refuse to grant an Order of condemnation. As a result, the Sanitary Inspector is placed in an unenviable position. Later on in this report, I will refer to an occasion when the Magistrate at Old Street police court refused to condemn meat which was quite unfit for human consumption, ard which in my opinion was going to be made into sausages. A third method of dealing with frozen meat prior to offering it for sale, is to put it through a process known as " Defrosting." This is brought about by various means; one of the best methods is to put the meat into an air-proof chamber in which liquid ammonia is circulated under pressure through pipes placed on the walls of the chambers. The result is, that the frost is removed from the meat gradually, and without loss of blood or myosin, and the bloom on the surface of the meat is excellent, and would in many cases lead one to think it was that of home killed meat. This meat, though excellent in quality, does not receive a ready market owing to the extra price paid for its defrosting. It is unfortunate that some system is not introduced to identify frozen meat from prime fresh meat. Butchers in my opinion should be compelled to place a mark on all frozen or refrigerated meat so as to distinguish it from 41 fresh meat. It is illegal for a provision merchant to sell margarine as butter, or without a label clearly stating the nature of the article. Why should butchers be placed in a more favourable position ? Offal arrives in crates from Holland at our wharves. Upon arrival the offal is taken from the open crates, placed in hampers and then forwarded to the consignees. The ships that import the offal arrive at the wharves according to the tides, but the offal is not dispatched until about 2 a.m., in time for the market. At other times, the offal is transferred directly from the ships to the carriers' vans. Other offal is landed from the Continent and delivered by the Great Eastern Railway Company to Bishopsgate Street Station. It is most difficult to be certain of the wholesome condition of the offal, unless each organ is carefully examined. Taking into consideration the time of arrival and delivery it will be seen that this is practically impossible. Unsound Food Destroyed during the Year.

After fully considering the case the Committee decided to take proceedings against the wholesale dealer for having sold them, well knowing their condition. At the Police Court the defendent elected to go for trial. When the case was heard at the Sessions by the grand jury, the latter expressed the opinion that the baker should have also been proceeded against. The evidence of the baker was, however, an essential part of the Council's case; and we could not proceed without his assistance. 44 The Counsel who had been engaged to conduct the prosecution, in view of this expression of opinion, and considering that the case was a weak one, advised that we should agree to settle it out of Court. After considerable negotiation it was decided, without prejudice, to adjourn the case for a month, and if defendant paid an amount in settlement of the Council's costs before the expiration of that time, the prosecution would be withdrawn. As the defendant had already incurred a considerable expenditure in connection with his defence, it was thought that the total monetary payment would be sufficient punishment. This was afterwards confirmed by the Public Health Committee and on payment of our costs, which amounted to £30 5s. 6d., the prosecution was withdrawn. (2) Oysters.—On August 4th, I received information that 15,600 oysters, which were in the course of transit from Falmouth to Ostend, had been taken during the closed season from a polluted bed, and were unfit for human consumption. While they were in this district I had them seized and applied to the Magistrate for an order of condemnation. Some of the oysters had been previously submitted, at the instigation of the Fishmongers Company, to Dr. Klein, who examined three samples. 10 oysters from each sample were bacteriologically examined, and each one of these contained abundance of B. Coli Communis. Considering that this result was obtained by subjecting to analysis about 1/6 to 1/5 c c of the substance and liquor of each oyster, Dr. Klein considered that the oysters must have been grossly polluted with sewage or similar filth. The oysters were condemned at the Thames Police Court. The consignor was communicated with, but he maintained that the oysters became the property of the consignee when they were delivered on the train. It seems that the bed from which the oysters were taken, had been condemned by the Fishmongers' Company, and the oysters were prohibited from being sold in London. The consignor also claimed that the oysters were not deposited for sale, but simply passing to the consignee, who would have placed them in clean water prior to being sold. I interviewed the consignees in Ostend, who stated that they would not have bought the oysters, if they had known they came from a polluted source. No further proceedings were taken against the owner, on account of the difficulty and expense that would be incurred in bringing witnesses from Ostend to give evidence in the case. The owner, however, gave an undertaking, that a statement would in future be delivered with each consignment informing the consignees, that the oysters must be placed in cleansing beds for some time prior to being sold for human consumption. 45 (3) On February 9th, Mr. Harris Kaston, 111, Cable Street, was summoned for having deposited for the preparation of sale on the above premises on January 12th, 23 eggs which were unsound and unfit for the food of man. He was fined £5 and £3 3s. costs. On May 29th, Messrs. Mayhew Bros., Watney Street, were summoned for depositing for sale 112 lbs. of beef and mutton which were in an unsound and unwholesome condition. They were fined £10 and 23s. costs. On June 11th, Mrs. Eliza Cain, of 95, Brook Street, Ratcliffe, was summoned for selling, and for having on her premises in the course of preparation for sale, meat, which was unsound and unfit for the food of man. She was fined .£6 and £3 3s. costs. On Sunday, June 17th, 12 lbs. of beef were seized in a butcher's shop in Goulston Street. At the time of seizure the meat was in the basement of the house in a tin receptacle. The latter was under a tap with the water running on it. The sausage machine was in the same room. The Magistrate refused to condemn it as he was not satisfied that it was deposited for the purpose of preparation for sale. On July 10th, Mr. Samuel Harris, of 77, Whitechapel Road, was summoned for having at 41, Old Montague Street, 78½ lbs. of meat deposited for the purpose of preparation for the food of man, the same being unsound and unfit. The meat was in the same room and in close proximity to the mincing machine. The Magistrate, having heard the evidence of the defendant and his witnesses, was satisfied that the meat was deposited as waste only, and dismissed the summons. On June 10th, Mr. Joseph Magnus, of 11, New Goulston Street, Whitechapel, was summoned for having exposed for sale, 12 lbs. of pieces of meat, the same being unsound and unfit for the food of man. The defendant pleaded that, owing to illness he was absent from his shop, which was left in charge of his assistant. He also stated that the shop, which was closed on Friday night, had not been opened until the following Sunday morning, and that the meat had not been examined before it was exposed for sale. The Magistrate said he did not think the meat was exposed with any wilful intent, and there would be no fine, but the defendant would have to pay £2 2s. costs. On September 15th, Mr. Bertie Leach, 100, Salmon Lane, was summoned for exposing for sale and having on his premises in course of preparation for sale, a quantity of ox cheeks, tripe, and bullock's hearts, which were unfit for human consumption. He was fined £10 and £4 4s, costs. 46 On September 19th, Mrs. Fanny Grodzinsky, baker, 31, Fieldgate Street, was summoned for being in possession of a quantity of liquid eggs which were intended for human food, the same being unsound and unfit for human consumption. She was fined £12 and £2 2s. costs. On September 19th, Mr. Hyman Grodzinsky, baker, 20, Bedford Street, and 265, Commercial Road, was summoned for being in possession of a quantity of liquid eggs which were intended for food, the same being unsound and unfit for human consumption. He was fined £8 and £2 2s. costs. On September 19th, Mr. Goodman Weibitsky, baker, 75, Oxford Street, was summoned for being in possession of a quantity of liquid eggs which were intended for human food, the same being unsound and unfit for human consumption. He was fined £3 and £1 1s. costs. On November 1st, Mr. Joseph Cohen, 31, Pelham Street, was summoned for selling unsound plums from a barrow in Bell Lane. The summons was dismissed because the Magistrate believed the defendant was only sorting the plums at the time of seizure and they were not therefore exposed for sale. Report on the Examination of Food presented to the Public Health Committee on June 14th, 1906. A report on the examination of food in our Borough naturally falls under the following heads:— (1) Canned goods. (2) Butchers' meat. (3) Meat in Tripe Dressers' shops. (4) Dairies and Cowsheds. (5) Ice Cream. (6) Other food {e.g., Eggs, Fried Fish). 1. Canned Goods. At the present time there is only one firm in this Borough which manufactures canned goods, viz.—Messrs. Cunningham & De Fourier. Their premises are situated in West India Dock Road. In addition to making tinned meat, they manufacture meat paste, tinned vegetables, fruit cordials, &c. Whenever I visited the premises, I found the floors, tables and appliances in a clean condition. The description in the newspapers of meat thrown on the ground, and trodden on accidentally by men with dirty boots, as is said to 47 be frequent in factories belonging to the American Beef Trust, does not apply to the factories belonging to the above-named firm. The meat that is cooked, and afterwards put in tins is bought in Smithfield Market where it undergoes a thorough examination before it is delivered. It is therefore liable to a double inspection before it is converted into tinned meat. A large quantity of tinned goods is imported into London through the wharves in our Borough. In 1901 a special inspector was appointed to inspect the food landed on the wharves. There are 97 wharves in the Borough, but food of all kinds is landed at the following 33, viz.:— (a) Irongate and St. Katherine's Wharf. Fruit and vegetables from the Continent, and carcases of pigs, cows, calves, sheep, offal in casks, rabbits, turkeys, eggs and cheese, also from the Continent are the principal items of food landed on this wharf. They are generally discharged twice a week. (b) Harrison's Wharf. Flour, potatoes, sugar and condensed milk in churns are landed on this wharf. (c) South Devon Wharf. Flour, potatoes, sugar and condensed milk in churns are landed on this wharf. (d) British and Foreign Wharf. Fruit, vegetables, nuts, flour, potatoes, and all classes of canned goods from the Continent are landed on this wharf. (e) Miller's Wharf. Flour, sugar and occasionally canned goods. (f) Carron Wharf. Potatoes and horse-flesh for cats'-meat from Scotland are landed on this wharf. (g) Hermitage Wharf. Cereals, (Ovo, Quaker Oats, Force, &c.), and potatoes are landed on this wharf. 48 (h) Colonial Wharf. Tea is landed on this wharf. (i) Gun Wharf. Spices, tea, sago and tapioca are landed here. (j) Morocco Wharf. Bananas, tomatoes and eggs are imported through this wharf. (k) St. John's Wharves. Flour, cocoa and spices are imported through these wharves. (I) 1, Red Lion Street. All classes of canned goods. (m) Lower St. John's Wharf. Flour, sugar and cocoa-nuts are imported through this wharf. (n) Sharp's Wharf. Lard, bacon, fruit pulps, spices and dried fruits. (o) Middleton's Wharf. Bananas, oranges, grapes, potatoes, onions, dried fruits, fruit pulps, tomatoes, sugar, anchovies and treacle. (p) Metropolitan Wharves. Spices, cocoa, coffee and chicory. (q) River Plate Wharf. Canned meats, tinned soups, tongues, and concentrated meat juice. (r) Thorpe's Wharf. Pine-apples, tongues and condensed milk. (s) Linde's Wharf. All classes of meat, game, rabbits and butter. (t) Finnis Fisher's Wharf. Canned goods of all kinds and pulp are landed here. The owners are also jam and pickle manufacturers. (u) Free Trade Wharf. All classes of canned goods. 49 (v) Bristol Wharf. All classes of canned goods. (w) Ratcliff Cross Wharf. Flour, potatoes, anchovies and lemons. (x) London Wharf. Two-thirds of the canned goods landed on this wharf belong to the Government and are inspected by the Government Officials only. (y) New Sufferance Wharf. Fresh cabbages, fruit pulps and vegetables in brine for pickle making. (z) Eagle Wharf. Flour, beef and pork in casks. (aa) New Sun Wharf. The general trade of this wharf is to take fruit out of tins and to put it into bottles. (bb) Cooper's Wharves—Oporto and Old Sun. All classes of canned goods, flour and dried milk. (cc) Victoria Wharf. Onions, potatoes, flour and port. (dd) Saunder's " Wharf." Rejected condensed milks from shops belonging to the same firm are taken to these premises and stored. They are afterwards taken away for pig feeding. (ee) Brewer's Wharf. Flour and grain for breweries. (ff) Limehouse Wharf. Potatoes. (gg) Dundee Wharf. Carcases of beef, and potatoes. Canned goods are chiefly landed at Cooper's, Bristol, Thorpe's, Miller's, British & Foreign, and Free Trade Wharves, and they are discharged from ships on certain fixed days of the week. D 50 The Inspector calls at each of these latter wharves on alternate days of the week. There are practically no canned goods belonging to any firm connected with the Beef Trust imported through wharves in our District. A certain quantity of their goods is transferred or sold as ships rations ; and these pass through Wilson's Wharf. They are examined by the Board of Trade Officers, before the ship sails. The Canned goods that are landed on wharves in Stepney are imported chiefly from the Colonies, and are as follows, viz.:— Fruits and fruit pulps from Tasmania. Foods of all kinds from Queensland. Rabbits, fruit and meat from Australia. Meats from New Zealand. Meats, salmon and fruits from Canada. There are also meats and fruits landed from California, and meats from South America. In 1901, 110 tons of food were destroyed. In 1902, 430 tons of food were destroyed. In 1903, 488 tons of food were destroyed. In 1904, 735 tons of food were destroyed. In 1905, 232 tons of food were destroyed. so that during the last five years an average of over 1 ton of tinned food has been destroyed daily. What became of this enormous quantity previous to the systematic inspection of the wharves ? Doubtless a large quantity was destroyed by the owners themselves. The remainder probably found its way on the market in various ways. One dodge that was fairly frequently adopted was to apply to the owners for blown and doubtful stuff which was stated by the applicants to be used as manure. The owners in many instances suspected that it was being sold for human food, and in order to protect themselves they caused the buyer to pay for the goods at the time of purchase, but did not give the receipt till the following day. On this receipt, there were the magic words "not to be used for human consumption." The price was in all such cases higher than could be expected if the goods were only intended for manure or pig feeding. The fact that tins are "blown " or bulging indicates that the contents are decomposed and unfit for human consumption. The longer the food has been decomposing, the greater will be the amount of gas accumulated, and there will consequently be more bulging of the ends of the tins. It is not an 51 uncommon occurrence to see the tins actually burst from the pressure of the gas inside. When tins are blown it is palpable to all that the goods are unsaleable. Even if they were sold in this condition, no one would partake of the contents, which often smell abominably immediately the tins are opened. At one time, there was a fairly common practice of pricking tins that were only slightly blown, to liberate the gas and afterwards re-soldering the holes. The tins were then cleaned and fresh labels were pasted on, which covered the pricked holes in the ridges at the sides of the tins. The bulging of the tins disappeared and they assumed their original shape and form. When I was Medical Officer of Health to the Limehouse Board of Works, I instituted proceedings in February, 1899, against a large wholesale dealer who practised this dodge. The case lasted several days, and a great deal of interest was taken in it by the press, and the methods adopted for pricking.and re-soldering the tins were therefore given wide publicity. The dealer was sent to prison for five months with hard labour. I am glad to state that since this case I have found no evidence whatever of such a fraudulent method of dealing with blown tins so as to make them appear that the contents are sound. There is a condition that may cause the tins to appear blown to the uninitiated, when in reality they are only collapsed. This occurs when the tins have been crushed in some way ; one part of the tins is bent and the ends are bulged. This condition causes the tins to be sold cheaper, and makes them unsaleable except to provision shops where the food is sold by weight, or where it is used for making sandwiches, The contents of these collapsed tins are perfectly wholesome. Sometimes the contents of the tins may be in an advanced stage of putrefaction, although the tins shows no signs of bulging. When this is the case, the condition of the contents can only be ascertained by opening the tin. This is due to the fact that the food had become decomposed prior to its being canned. Antiseptics were added to prevent any further decomposition. As no decomposition actually took place after canning, no gas was evolved, and therefore the tins did not become blown although the meat itself was tainted. This probably occurs oftener with tinned tongue than with any other kind of potted meat. The rule may, however, be taken as practically correct, that with this exception, decomposed food will cause the tins to bulge or become " blown." Before the gas has accumulated in sufficient quantity to have any effect on the tin, so far as can be seen by the eye, its presence, and therefore the presence of putrefying food in an early stage may be detected by an experienced D 2 52 man by slightly tapping the tin with the hand. It gives a note different from that given when a sound tin is struck. The note is more resonant, and, speaking musically, it is half a tone to a tone higher in the scale than that of a sound tin. A similar effect is produced when the human chest is percussed, Only conversely. That is, the Physician diagnoses a consolidation of the lung, when a duller sound is produced on percussing the chest with the fingers, than is given when the person examined is healthy. The sound given by striking the blown tin is more resonant, because it contains gas, and that of the chest is less resonant because there is less air present than in the healthy Lung. There is another factor that causes the tinned food to be dangerous, although the food itself appears perfectly wholesome, and there is no sign of decomposition. This occurs when the canning is old, and some of the tin or lead, which is used to solder the lid, has been dissolved. During the last few years I have frequently analysed the contents of old tins which were found to contain such large quantities of tin, together with occasionally small quantities of lead, as to be positively dangerous. The tins show no sign of bulging, and when they are opened the contents appear wholesome and taste as well as any fresh cooked meat. It is sometimes very difficult to persuade the owners to surrender such goods, and it is only when I absolutely refuse to allow them to be removed, and I threaten to have them taken to the Police Court to be condemned by the Magistrate, that the owners consent to submit them to their own analyst for examination, and ultimately surrender them. The maximum amount of tin that I have found in canned goods is as follows:— Lobster 2.94 grains per lb. Mackerel .55 grains per lb. Pine Cuttings 2.97 grains per lb. Salmon 1.32 grains per lb. Condensed Milk 2.37 grains per lb. Apricot 2.92 grains per lb. Raspberry pulp .65 grains per lb. Liquid eggs (in tins) .55 grains per lb. Ham .50 grains per lb. Black Currant pulp 1.96 grains per lb. Apricot pulp .60 grains per lb. Peas .88 grains per lb. The presence of a trace of lead was detected in the tinned Salmon only. No trace of it could be discovered in the others. 53 Food that has been in tins for three years, and more, should be looked at with suspicion, and a few samples should be analysed. They should not be allowed to be placed on the market until the absence of tin and lead has been amply proved. On one occasion I examined a large consignment of raspberries imported from New Zealand. They had been treated with Sulphur in order to preserve them. The Sulphur fumes had discoloured them. The colour was restored by soaking the raspberries in an aniline dye. Diseased meat may have been used in the first instance. If fresh and tinned properly, it will not decompose and cause the tins to bulge. It will not be detected in the usual way and will thus pass the strictest examination. Bacteriological examination even, would be valueless as a practical test. It would be quite possible for the whole of the obviously diseased part of the carcase to be put in one tin, though the whole carcase may have been infected. The contents of one or two tins would be no indication of the contents of the others. That is, one tin may possibly contain the only part of the diseased carcase that would give a positive bacteriological result. If this particular tin was not thus examined, the whole consignment would be passed as wholesome, whereas it would be dangerous to the health of persons consuming any portion of it. Therein, the result of the examination would differ from that of the chemical analysis. In the latter the tinned food would be practically of the same age, and if tin or lead had been dissolved in one, the chances are greatly in favour of their having been dissolved in the others. Furthermore, the bacteria or bacilli may have been destroyed when the meat was boiled previous to its being canned, but the ptomaines which result from their growth would not be destroyed. The presence of ptomaines can only be discovered by a physiological test, that is by the effect they produce when administered to mice or guinea pigs, etc. The same remark applies to the presence of dirt in the factories. Examination of canned goods will seldom give an indication of the sanitary condition and cleanliness of the factories. It will therefore be seen that no examination is possible in this country to detect disease in the meat imported in tins. Strict examination of the carcases immediately the animals are killed, and their rejection with subsequent destruction, if found to be diseased, are the only means of protection from this danger. 54 It may be humiliating to have to confess it, but we are impotent in the matter, and we have to depend absolutely on the knowledge and integrity of the officials supervising the canning of goods abroad. The meat that is used for canning purposes in our district is bought in the Central Meat Market where it is thoroughly examined and is afterwards under our supervision. If diseased meat is used it will be due to the laxity of our own officials, as well as the officers of the City Corporation who are responsible for the supervision of the Central Meat Market. To sum up this part of the question:— (1) Decomposed food will as a rule in time cause bulging of the tins. (2) Experienced men only can detect the presence of putrefaction of the contents, when the gas is not sufficient to cause bulging. (3) Blown tins are apparent to all, and when opened, the contents are offensive. (4) Tin and on rare occasions lead may be present in such quantities as to be injurious to health, though the food itself may appear to be quite wholesome. Their presence can only be detected by chemical examination. (5) Diseased meat may have been used. No practical examination will detect the presence of such diseased meat, once it has been tinned, for a bacteriological examination of a few tins out of each consignment would not be a guarantee of the condition of the contents of the remainder. 2.—Butchers' Meat. There are 150 to 160 butchers' shops in the Borough; at 112 there is a mincing machine on the premises. There are 10 licensed slaughter-houses. It is most difficult to keep the latter under strict supervision. The butchers slaughter whenever they like, and at all times of the day and night. It is therefore impossible thoroughly to inspect the carcases before they are removed for sale. The only real remedy is to have public Abattoirs, where slaughtering would take place during stated hours, and where a skilled official could inspect all carcases. In would be an improvement on the present method if regulations could be made fixing the hours for slaughtering in the various slaughterhouses, and not allowing any of the meat to be delivered until it had been inspected. The most convenient times for slaughtering could be left to the butchers themselves. The same remark applies to the mincing of meat or sausage making. Part of the meat may be tainted, but when it is 55 chopped up finely, and passed through the mincing machine, spices, garlic, etc., are added in order to disguise its offensive smell. If I knew exactly the time the operation took place, I could arrange that the Sanitary Inspector should call and examine the meat previous to its being minced. The way the meat in the butchers' shop is hung, or exposed for sale, adds to the chances it has of becoming infected. When meat is hung in front of the shop, the window being removed, it is liable to become infected by means of dust from the streets, although it is true that bacteria on the outside of the meat can easily be destroyed in the process of cooking. The meat in the shops is constantly examined by the various inspectors. Fully 95 per cent, of the meat sold in the district is that of animals slaughtered in slaughterhouses outside the Borough. 3—Meat in Tripe-Dressers' Shops. There are six tripe dressers' shops in the Borough. Two of these boil cats'-meat in the same room in which human food is boiled, and afterwards sell it in the same shop in which human food is sold. There has been a great improvement during the last year or two in this respect. In July, 1901, proceedings were taken against a tripe-dresser for having diseased livers, tripe, etc., deposited on the premises for the purpose of being prepared for human food. He was fined £20. He had three shops; cats'meat and human food were indiscriminately mixed in the boiling rooms, as well as in the shop. His defence was, that the diseased stuff would only be used for cats'-meat and not for human food. As diseased livers were found in the same tub as good healthy ones, his defence was not accepted by the Magistrate. Soon after his conviction the three shops were closed. Two years ago I seized some diseased livers in a slaughterhouse. The defence of the butcher was, that he sold, under contract, all the livers to a certain tripedresser. If any of these were found to be diseased, they would be used for cats'-meat, and an equivalent money allowance made for them. On this tripedresser's premises cats'-meat and human food were boiled in the same boilers and sold in the same shop. The diseased meat, it was stated, would not be used for human food. When his assistant, who was employed in the boiling room, was asked at the Police Court proceedings what the appearance of a liver was under a certain diseased condition, which is a common one, he replied that he did not know—a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. The present conditions in the above shop show a decided improvement. The boiler used for cooking cats'-meat is labelled to that effect, and human food is 56 not cooked in it. The cats'-meat which in this instance consists of lungs only —is kept in the shop in a special box duly labelled. I am still of opinion, however, that cats'-meat should not be prepared on the same premises as human food, nor sold in the same shop. The basement of the premises of another tripe-dresser was in a filthy state. In this basement on June 12th of this year there were nearly two tons of meat—fresh and pickled—consisting of sheep's heads, tripe, livers, brawn, etc. The boilers were also in the basement. The water closet is situated in this room without any partition or wall surrounding it. When I entered the basement I detected a foul sewer smell, which was due to the fact that the drains were exposed, and one of the pipes was broken. The owner not only stored his own meat here, but accommodated a neighbouring butcher as well. The basement was a most unsuitable place in which to store human food of any kind, and I gave instructions that the meat should be at once removed. On going to another part of the basement, I found 60 ox tails, which were evidently put on one side, and not intended for human consumption at the time of my visit. The tripe-dresser informed me that he had bought them about four hours previously at the meat market from representatives of the American Beef Trust, and when he returned home he found that they were quite unfit for human consumption. He immediately wrote to the vendor stating their condition, and that he was going to return them the following morning. At the time of my visit the ox tails were not therefore deposited for the purpose of preparation for sale, and on this account they were not liable to be seized, in such a way that Police Court proceedings could be successfully instituted against the Beef Trust. I caused them to be destroyed at once. This is another instance of a retailer who tries to be honest and scrupulous, but by his action shields a dishonest and unscrupulous wholesale trader. In these tripe dressers' shops, sheep's heads and livers are mostly sold. Tongues are seldom sold in these shops. It is a curious fact, but a fact for all that, that one part of the carcase of a horse is so seldom seen exposed for sale as cats'-meat. I mean a horse's tongue. I have looked at hundreds of barrows and shops at which cats'-meat is sold, but I have never yet seen the tongue of a horse exposed for sale therein. What becomes of the tongues of all the horses that are slaughtered in London every year ? They are quite different in appearance from the tongue of the Ox. The former has a smooth upper surface, and has a broad end. The tongue of the Ox on the contrary has a rough surface and a narrow extremity. It ought therefore to be easily recognized. 57 4.—Dairies and Cowsheds. There are in the Borough 942 premises where milk is sold. These include 42 Cowsheds. Milkshops are registered only, whereas Cowsheds are Licensed by the London County Council. Cowsheds are liable to a double inspection, viz.: that of the local authorities and of the London County Council. Either or both can object to the licence being renewed on licensing day. No new Cowshed is likely to be licensed, but an\one can register as a milk vendor and sell milk, although his premises may be most unsuitable. The Dairies and Milkshops Orders give the Sanitary Authorities power to take proceedings if the milk utensils are kept in a dirty state, but do not give the power of refusing to register milk vendors when they are of opinion that the conditions are unsuitable. A large number of the above milk vendors are small general tradesmen, selling possibly a quart of milk only a day. In the shop, and in close promixity to the milk itself, may be seen cans of parafin, soap, gorgonzola cheese, and other high smelling commodities. I am strongly of opinion that milk should not be sold in small general shops of this description. Sanitary Authorities have power to compel cowsheds to be well-lighted, ventilated, and to be kept in a clean condition. They have no power, however, to insist on the milking being carried out under suitable and sanitary conditions. As I have stated on a previous occasion, the dirtiest servant in the employment of the milkman is always the person whose duty it is to milk the cows. The milkman would not dare to send this man into the streets with a churn to sell milk in the same condition that he is always seen in the Cowshed. It would be such a bad advertisement for him, that his trade would be ruined in a very short time. Most of the milkmen who keep cows used formerly to be small tenant farmers, before they migrated to London. I do not think that there is any improvement in the method adopted of milking, as compared with their practice when they were farming. In analysing milk, it is no uncommon sight to find decomposing straw, soil and other filth in the milk. When I have visited the Cowsheds and watched the cowmen milking, I have not been surprised at this. The cowman does not consider it necessary, but rather a waste of time to wash his hands before he starts milking. In order to have the necessary moisture on the palms of his hands, he spits on them, or soaks them in a little of the milk which he has added to the milking-can for that purpose. His boots are in such a filthy state that they have generally the appearance of not having been cleaned for weeks, and his clothes are in a similar state. It seems to be an easy matter for the Legislature to authorise the making of regulations insisting on the personal cleanliness of the persons responsible for the 58 milking of the cows. They could include a regulation insisting on the cowman washing his hands before beginning to milk, and on his wearing a clean white overall during the process. I am quite aware of the fact that some large dairy companies adopt these measures. These companies do not add Boracic acid or other preservatives to their milk, for they have no need to. It is the presence of dirt in the milk that is partly accountable for the necessity of adding preservatives to keep the milk from becoming sour. If the milk were produced under clean conditions, and properly cooled it would not be necessary to add preservatives even in the warmest weather. Taking for granted that the milkman is responsible for the Cowshed and its surroundings, and that the shop and the other part of the premises are under the supervision of his wife and daughters : I have nothing but praise for the latter. I have always found the milk utensils and appliances in a very clean condition. It was not necessary even to issue a caution to them in a single instance throughout the whole of last year. The trouble encountered in this direction was always with the small general tradesman. Police Court proceedings were taken against 24 of the latter for not keeping the milk utensils in a clean condition, and several others were cautioned. Milk was taken for analysis in every shop throughout the Borough during the year 1905, with the exception of a few, in which milk for analysis was bought during the first month of this year. At present no systematic inspection is made to detect the presence or absence in the milk of tubercle bacilli, which are a cause of consumption in the human being. A cow may have tuberculosis and yet give perfectly good milk with no sign of bacilli in it. Immediately the teats of such cows become ulcerated however, the tubercle bacilli swarm in the milk. Such milk ought not to be used for human consumption. 5.—Ice Cream. Ice cream is manufactured on 80 premises in the Borough. These premises are kept under supervision by the Inspectors, and, in addition, I make a personal inspection of each one at the commencement of every season. If the premises are in any way suspicious, I have the drains tested, and I cause a bacteriological examination to be made of the ice cream itself. 6.—Other Foods. Rotten eggs are sometimes used in the manufacture of confectionery, and as the Members of the Public Health Committee are informed from time to time seizures are made, Police Court proceedings taken, and heavy penalties are inflicted on the owners. 59 The smell arising from fried fish shops is often objectionable. I always insist on a hood being constructed over the fire with a flue to carry off the fumes. Carelessness is often responsible for the offensive odour emitted, as the nuisance is aggravated if sufficient oil is not added to the pan whilst cooking, and the oil is allowed to be burnt. The fish itself is bought in Billingsgate Market, where it is inspected previous to being sold. It is usually cooked on the same day and it does not therefore often turn bad. In conclusion, I have no hesitation in assuring you that the officials of the Public Health Department are fully alive to the dangers lurking in diseased and unsound food, and that they take full advantage of the powers conferred by the various Acts of Parliament. As I have indicated in this report, these powers are deficient in many directions and I think now is the time that they ought to be materially strengthened. Resolutions approved by the Borough Council on the recommen dation of the Public Health Committee:— (A) Milk. 1. That the London County Council should be empowered to make regulations to be enforced by the Metropolitan Borough Councils insisting on the cleaniness of cows and of persons milking cows. 2. That a dairyman should be required to notify the Medical Officer of Health of any cow suffering, or suspected to be suffering from tuberculosis or ulceration of the udder, and that it should be an offence to sell the milk from such a cow. 3. That the Metropolitan Borough Councils should be empowered to require a dairyman to furnish upon demand to the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough a list of the sources of his supply. 4. That the London County Council and the Metropolitan Borough Councils should be authorised to prohibit the supply within their districts of milk from any dairy (wherever situate) if the Medical Officers of Health are of opinion that infectious disease or tuberculosis is caused or likely to be caused by the consumption of such milk. 5. That the London County Council and the Metropolitan Borough Councils should be empowered to compensate a milk vendor whose milk supply 60 is stopped at the request of the Sanitary Authority on account of suspicion that it is infectious and whose milk is, as the result of further inquiry, subsequently determined not to have been infective. 6. That Metropolitan Borough Councils should be empowered to refuse to register premises unsuitable for the purpose of the sale of milk. 7. That the act of mixing water or separated milk with whole milk for the purpose of sale should be made a penal offence. 8. That the London County Council should be empowered to take samples of milk at any railway station in the administrative County of London and to institute legal proceedings in respect of adulterations of such samples. 9. (a) That all warranties should be in a specified form and be properly executed, and stamped (b) That a continuous warranty shall be deemed to be a fresh warranty in respect of each sale or transaction, and that it shall not be a defence to a prosecution against a warrantor to allege that the warranty was given above six months previous to the prosecution, provided the sample in respect of which the prosecution is instituted was taken within the statutory period. (c) That if the defendant in a prosecution intends relying on a warranty, he shall give notice to the Local Authority, and the warrantor shall then be joined forthwith in the summons. (d) That the person giving the warranty to the retailer shall not be permitted to plead as a defence a warranty that he has himself received, but he shall be left to obtain his remedy at Common Law. (e) That the onus of proof of the fact that the milk was delivered unadulterated shall rest upon the warrantor at the hearing of the charge. (f) That the certificate of the Public Analyst shall, in respect of a sample of milk, proved to have been sold in the condition in which it was supplied by a warrantor, be evidence against the warrantor. (B) Canned Goods. 10. That the year of canning should be impressed on the cans. 11. That a certain proportion of the apparently sound tins (say one per cent.) from each consignment shall be opened on importation, and the contents examined under the supervision or instructions of the Sanitary Authority concerned, prior to such canned foods being placed on the market, in a manner similar to the examination at present carried out by the Board of Trade of all tinned goods intended to be consumed on ships. 61 12. That tins which are known to the trade as "doubtfuls" shall be deemed to be unfit for human consumption. 13. That food intended for canning should be liable to inspection by independent officials prior to being canned, and all foods shall be canned under strict hygienic conditions. 14. That the use of preservatives in canned foods is unnecessary, and should under no circumstances be permitted. [We are also of opinion that it is desirable that dealers in unsound goods should not be permitted to engage in the sale or preparation for sale of foodstuffs intended for human consumption ; but we do not submit any recommendation on this point at the present time.] (C) Meat. 15. That the London County Council should be authorised to establish public slaughterhouses. 16. That the mincing of meat (for sausages, etc.) should only take place at certain specified times. Meat minced at other times should be liable to be confiscated, and the persons permitting such mincing during unauthorised hours shall be subject to a penalty, unless immediate notice has been given to the Medical Officer of Health of the intention to mince meat at times other than the specified hours. 17. That the preparation of human food in the same premises as food that is not so intended, and the sale of cats-meat in the same shop as food intended for human consumption be prohibited. 18. That the sale, for the purpose of human food, of the carcase of any animal which has died a natural death, or which was in such a condition through disease that it had to be destroyed, be prohibited. 19. That Metropolitan Borough Councils should be authorised to institute legal proceedings against the person who sends unsound meat to a butcher for the purpose of sale, or of preparation for sale for human consumption, even though the butcher does not expose such meat for sale, and also against the person who consigns to a butcher unsound meat which is seized in transit. (D) Coffee Stalls. 20. That coffee stalls should be licensed, and that the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts should be amended so as to permit of samples being taken of the articles of food sold at coffee stalls. 62 (E) Food sold as mixtures. 21. That the Local Government Board should be authorised to determine the standards of food mixtures, such as mustard condiment, coffee mixture, chocolate mixture, and other articles to which the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts apply, and that the percentages of the ingredients of such mixtures should be clearly shown on the packages in which they are sold. (F) Preservatives and Colouring Matters in Articles of Food. 22. That the recommendations of the Departmental Committee, 1901, with regard to the use of preservatives and colouring matters in articles of food should be given effect to. G) Shell Fish. 23. That the laying down of all edible forms of shell fish in sewage polluted creeks or other dangerous localities should be prohibited under heavy penalties, and that all unpolluted layings, fattening beds, storage beds and storage ponds at present in use should be protected from pollution by sewage. (H) Fried Fish Shops and Fish Curers' Premises. 24. That the London County Council should be authorised to make byelaws to be enforced by the Metropolitan Borough Councils for the regulation of the business of a fried fish seller and fish curer, and that such businesses should only be carried on in premises duly licensed by the Metropolitan Borough Councils. (I) Preparation or Exposure of Food for Sale. 25. That the Metropolitan Borough Councils should be authorised to examine premises and stalls in, or on, which food is prepared or exposed for sale and to require the removal of conditions likely to give rise to contamination. The Public Analyst's Annual Report. During the year 1906, 1147 samples were examined under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, consisting of:—782 Milks, 1 Skimmed Milk, 219 Butters, 2 Margarines, 2 Cheeses, 1 Lard, 14 Cocoas, 25 Coffees, 2 Chicorys, 2 Ground Gingers, 28 Mustards, 52 Peppers, 1 Arrowroot, 2 Wheat Flours, 5 Oatmeals, 2 Breads, 2 Brandies, 1 Whisky, 1 Demerara Sugar, 1 Camphorated Oil, 1 Citric Acid, 1 Tartaric Acid. 241 Samples, or 21.0 per cent. were found to be adulterated. These consisted of:—172 Milks, 62 Butters, 1 Margarine, 4 Cocoas, 1 Coffee, 1 Whisky. 63 Proceedings were taken in 122 cases. Two samples during the year were referred to the Somerset House Chemists for their decision, in both cases the Public Analyst's certificate was upheld. Sunday Samples. During the year 1906, Samples of milk were taken for analysis on Sundays in addition to week-days. The samples were purchased from barrows and hand-cans in the streets. 88 Samples in all were taken on 24 days, of these 18 were found to be adulterated and 7 prosecutions resulted. The amount of adulterations of Sunday milks was 20'4 per cent. as compared with 22.2 per cent of the week-day samples. This is of interest as showing that contrary to the popular idea, milk adulterations, at any rate in Stepney, is no more prevalent on Sundays than week days. The total fines secured during the year amounted to £252 3s. Od. The total costs allowed amounted to £112 17s. 6d. The average fine secured on the prosecutions was £2 1s. 4d.

In the Sanitary Inspectors' Report Table will be found the amount of work carried out by each Inspector during the year, together with its nature. 38,374 houses were inspected, 7,134 being the result of house to house visitation. 12,513 intimation notices were served for the abatement of various nuisances, and 7,150 statutory notices were served. Police Court proceedings were taken in 112 cases, where the statutory notices were disregarded. This does not include proceedings under the Food and Drugs' Acts. 57,312 re-visits were made to premises to superintend the necessary work for the abatement of various nuisances. 2,963 workshops were inspected, and 857 were ordered to be lime-washed and cleansed. 9,768 drains were tested, and 3,760 were either constructed or re-constructed, cleansed or repaired. 74 404 new soil pipes were fixed and ventilated; 1,759 new closet pans and traps were fixed, and 1.893 closets were either cleansed and repaired or provided with additional light and ventilation. 2,925 yards, forecourts and areas, were paved or repaired. Notices were served to provide 1,497 sanitary dust receptacles and 43 manure receptacles were provided ; 743 offensive accumulations were removed from the rear of dwelling houses. 12,618 visits were made for the purpose of detecting overcrowding and 805 notices were served for its abatement. This had the desired effect in the majority of cases, but the notices were disregarded in 10 cases and summonses were applied for. The walls of 716 verminous rooms were stripped and lime-washed. 66 underground rooms which were illegally occupied, were discontinued from being used as such. 120 notices were served for the abatement of smoke nuisances. 366 bakehouses were visited and 283 cleansing notices served. The number of milkshops and dairies on the register at the end of the year was 1,016. Each one was visited at least twice during the year and the milk utensils examined. Proceedings were taken against 12 milk vendors for using dirty milk measures. Since the beginning of 1904, special visits have been made for the purpose of detecting overcrowding. Partly due to the lowering of rents, and partly to the ample housing accommodation in the Borough as compared with previous years, overcrowding is on the decrease as evidenced by the following table :— Year.

The number of workshops in the district vary from time to time. They were periodically visited during the year. Cleanliness.—The workshops were cleansed at the proper period, 857 notices being, however, served before they were done. Proceedings were taken in one case only. Ventilation.—Ventilation was improved and effluvium nuisances were abated as the result of serving 91 notices. Overcrowding—Overcrowding was abated in 49 workshops, one owner being prosecuted before this was done. Sanitary Accommodation.—68 additional water closets were provided during the year. The number of inspections to outworkers' premises is apparently not satisfactory, but it must be taken into consideration that the lists of outworkers received from other Councils include addresses which are really workshops in our district, and are visited as such. One visit frequently includes many outworkers, inasmuch as a number of the latter often live at the same address. That is, six outworkers might be visited and the premises inspected, but one visit will only be credited to the Inspector. Further, in the list supplied by other Councils, there are included addresses supplied by firms, and repeated by a number of others. One address may thus be counted 20 times or more. The above may to a great extent be responsible for the apparent inadequacy of the number of inspections as compared with the total number of outworkers. Some Firms sent in the lists once only, but these were firms who employed outworkers for the first time during the year. 88 FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS, LAUNDRIES, WORKPLACES AND HOMEWORK. 1. INSPECTION.
