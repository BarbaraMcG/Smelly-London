District Nurses visit many patients suffering from Tuberculosis and being treated at home; 1,114 visits were paid by the nurses in 1946. A limited provision is made for the supply of extra nourishment to tuberculous persons, and this usually takes the form of extra milk; 122 patients received help in this way during the year. The scheme for the provision of shelters has been continued, and one shelter is at present in use. TUBERCULOSIS ALLOWANCES MADE UNDER MINISTRY OF HEALTH MEMO. 226/T. The number of applications for allowances under this scheme considered during the year was 502; of this number 60 were new cases and 442 were for renewal of grant or alteration of assessment owing to changed circumstances.

Since the end of the war the number of patients attending the Solarium has steadily grown, and in spite of staff shortage 6,000 more treatments were given in 1946 than in 1945. Since the addition of a part-time orthopædic surgeon in October, 1944, it has been possible to extend the scope of the work to include manipulations, tenotomies, plasters and splints. During this year, more of these cases have been referred for treatment. Some children with congenital and rickety deformities have been successfully treated by manipulation and plaster. Many cases of stiff joints resulting from injury have made a complete recovery following manipulation and remedial exercises, and a number of cases of prolapsed intervertebral disc have been rendered symptom free. It has also been possible to provide more orthopædic apparatus to prevent and correct deformities which might otherwise have proved disabling or even crippling. A dozen patients who have had gold injections for rheumatoid arthritis have been followed up and have shown considerable improvement. The injection of phosphate solution into osteo arthritic joints, combined with electrotherapy, has also been used, and patients followed up over a period of many months have remained free from pain and disability. The following table shows the work done in the Solarium during 1946:- Total Number of Attendances 16,657 Number of Medical Examinations 2,146 Number of New Cases 754 Number of Discharges 788 Treatments: — Massage 5,583 Physical Exercises 2,504 Diathermy 3,001 Medical Electricity 5,700 Radiant Heat 6,445 Local Ultra Violet Light 1,843 General Ultra Violet Light 7,110 Orthopædic Treatments 66 Special Treatments 296 Total Number of Treatments 32,548 V.—MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE.

During the course of the year the whole-time home helps resigned from full-time work, preferring to be employed on a part-time basis with a guarantee of a minimum weekly wage of thirty shillings, and during the year 11 women were thus employed on part-time work, and attended on 140 patients. This scheme has been of immense help in the Borough, and has enabled us to give timely and invaluable help in a number of cases. Its success here has been considerably due to the fact that close personal attention has been given to every case, and to the help received from the District Medical Officer of the London County Council, who takes an intense interest in the welfare of the old people in the Borough. The total number of illegitimate children at present known to us to be living in the Borough is 163; this compares with the number of 137 for last year. HEALTH VISITORS.

X-RAY DEPARTMENT. Owing to the very great increase in the amount of X-ray work, it has become necessary to consider the extension of the Department. A scheme for this purpose is at present under consideration. The following table shows the work done during 1946: — Total number of Attendances 7,659 Number of Individual Cases 7,181 Number of New Cases 5,046 Number of Screenings 2,429 Analysis of Films: — Bones 348 Gastrointestinal Tract 256 Chests 6,431 Other Examinations 146 POST-NATAL AND SPECIAL CLINICS FOR WOMEN. The total number of attendances during the year, in which 49 sessions were held, was 523. There were 168 new cases, the majority of whom were suffering from menopausal or menstruation disorders; 26 were investigated for sterility; 13 were found to be pregnant; no cases of carcinoma were found. Suitable cases were treated at the Clinic, others being referred to their own doctors or to hospitals. EAR, NOSE AND THROAT CLINIC. This clinic was begun in January, 1946, and was a completely new venture. A full range of equipment to cover all requirements in an out-patient Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic was obtained without delay. This was a fortunate time for ordering instruments, as now there is considerable delay owing to the greater part of instrument production being ear-marked for export. The number of cases attending was at first small, but the Clinic has now reached a reasonable size. Children represent the majority of patients attending, and as is usual the greater number of these are children requiring removal of tonsils and adenoids. The names of these children are put down on the waiting fist at University College Hospital. By this means the children remain under the charge of the same surgeon who has seen them at the Public Health Centre, and avoid the routine of a second out-patient examination. Acute middle ear infections in children, and chronic middle ear infections in adults form the next biggest group. These are by far the most suitable type of case for a clinic of this description. There is adequate time for careful and repeated toilet and dressing of the ear, which is so essential in the treatment of middle ear disease. The majority do not require in-patient treatment and can, therefore, be dealt with entirely at the Public Health Centre. Nasal infections are not frequent. Some of these have been transferred to University College Hospital for operative treatment. A few cases are referred from the Tuberculosis Department for laryngeal examination. The numbers of patients sent up by doctors in the Borough about equal those referred from other departments within the Public Health Centre. During the year 48 sessions were held; the total number of attendances was 224, and the number of patients was 166. HEART CLINIC Patients, at this Clinic, come by appointment, and are sent by their own doctors for investigation. During the year 18 sessions were held; the total number of attendances was 77; the number of new patients was 37, of which number 17 were found to be suffering from cardiac disease. OPHTHALMIC CLINIC The number of sessions held during the year was 111. There were 715 new patients and the total number of attendances was 1,488. FOOT CLINIC.

HEALTH LECTURES AND FILM DISPLAYS During the year 1946, health lectures, film displays and demonstrations have been given as follows: — Youth Organisations 72 attended by 3,266 Schools 41 „ 9,010 Adult Organisations 134 „ 7,016 247 19,292 NEW FILMS A film entitled "Our Babies" produced at the latter end of 1945, was first shown to the public in January, 1946. This film tells the story of a day in the life of a child at a day nursery. Another new film was produced for the Gardens Department and shows the production of vegetables in Bermondsey and at Fairby Grange. These films have been well received and are in constant use. EXHIBITION Commencing August 13th and opening each day for five days, an exhibition called the" Domestic Front Exhibition was organised by the Ministry of Food with the co-operation of the Council and held in the Libraries Hall. A display of infant welfare foods was made on the stand allocated to this department, and films were shown each day. GENERAL PUBLICITY In April and again in November, a "Desk Reminder was produced and sent to each of the doctors practising in and near the Borough. Under the heading of " Municipal Clinics," a list of these Clinics was shown together with the names of specialists attending. A note was added further reminding the practitioners of the method of appointment and the telephone number of the Public Health Centre. About 35 of these cards were issued on each occasion. In order to draw the attention of mothers and expectant mothers to the advantages of Fairby Grange, enlarged photographs of the Home were mounted on display cards and issued for display at all Maternity and Child Welfare Centres. Attractive and up-to-date pamphlets on tuberculosis, diphtheria, personal hygiene, feeding baby, dress and other subjects have been distributed during the year. CITZENSHIP During 1946, arrangements were made with the head teachers of senior schools, for a number of their older girls and boys to visit suitable departments of the Council and to hear lectures with films on Local Government. Girls attended infant welfare centres and day nurseries, girls and boys visited the Municipal Offices and other Council buildings, including the Mayor's Parlour and committee rooms. The Mayor, Councillor Mrs. L. Jones, M.B.E., J.P., welcomed the children on a number of occasions and explained the procedure of Council meetings. Girls and boys also visited the bacteriological laboratory, and parties were invited to visit the Public Health Centre. The number of children making these visits was as follows: — 86 girls to infant welfare centres. 72 girls to day nurseries. 108 girls and boys to Council buildings. 90 girls and boys to Bacteriological Laboratory. 260 girls and boys to Public Health Centre. ROAD SAFETY CAMPAIGN Since the earlier part of the year, assistance has been given to the Road Safety Sub-Committee. Many films have been shown, lantern slides made, photographs taken and enlarged, and a film put into production dealing with the problem of road safety in Bermondsey. Lectures and film displays were as follows: — Schools 11 attended by 1,986 Other organisations 8 „ 470 19 2,456 IX.—SANITARY ADMINISTRATION HOUSING. During the year 1946 no areas were represented or declared by the Council. 21 new flats were completed on St. Olave's Estate. An additional 180 emergency factory-made houses, 10 year, were completed and occupied during 1946, bringing the total controlled by this Council to 240. A further 98 emergency factorymade houses, which have been completed and occupied, are controlled by the London County Council, who in accordance with their usual practice, have not reserved these for Bermondsey families. No 2-year hutments were provided during the year, the number remaining the same as for 1945, 54. As a result of the unauthorised occupation of a number of huts in the vacant Army Camp in Southwark Park dining September, it became necessary to ensure water supplies and lighting to the huts and sanitary conveniences for the families which numbered 30, comprising 75 persons over 10 years of age and 27 persons under 10 years. Of these, 22 families only had claims on Bermondsey for re-housing in accordance with the scheme approved by the Council. At December 31st the number of families had dropped to 26, one family being re-housed by this Council and 3 families having removed without assistance from the Council. Notices were served on persons interested in the properties Nos. 7, 8, 9 and 10, Braddon Street, that the making of Demolition Orders under Section 11, Housing Act, 1936, would be considered by the Council. A comparison of applications for housing accommodation for 1945 and 1946 is as follows: — No. separate accomodation Medical Certificate Homeless by Enemy Action Overcrowded General Total At: 1,288 144 49 1,104 3,104 31/12/45 519 31/12/46 67 1,064 130 127 706 2,094 Accommodation for 438 families was provided during 1946 in properties controlled by this Council and a further 165 Bermondsey families accommodated by the London County Council, 74 of whom were specially recommended by the Housing Department of this Council. 166 families were recommended to the London County Council on grounds of overcrowding. HOUSING ACT, 1936 —OVERCROWDING. No general census on overcrowding in the Borough has been undertaken during 1946, but a census was taken in Council properties, the result of which is summarised as follows: — (a) Occupied dwellings surveyed 3,594 (b) Number of rooms in dwellings under (a) 10,670 (c) Number of families 4,142 (d) Number of persons over 10 years of age 11,874 (e) Number of persons under 10 years of age 1,793 (f) Number of dwellings occupied by more than one family 460 (g) Number of dwellings overcrowded according to Housing Act standards 241 (h) Percentage of total dwellings overcrowded 6.7 ERADICATION OF BED BUGS.
