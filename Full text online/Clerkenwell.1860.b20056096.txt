VESTRY OF THE PARISH of SAINT JAMES AND SAINT JOHN, CLERKENWELL. FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT (For the Year 1860-61) In accordance with the directions contained in the 198th clause of the Metropolis Local Management Act, the Vestry present to the Parishioners, their Fifth Annual Report of their proceedings, for the year ending 25th March, 1861. During this period Meetings have been held as follows:— Vestry Meetings, (General) 27 Ditto (Special) 7 Committee of Works 30 Finance Committee 14 Assessment and Appeal Committee 8 Special Committees 21 107 THE FOLLOWING WORKS HAVE BEEN EXECUTED AS SANITARY IMPROVEMENTS. Sewers Cleansed 24 „ Repaired 3 Gullies Cleansed 212 ,, Repaired 27 4 Gullies Trapped 12 ,, Constructed 8 Airshafts „ 2 12-inch drains laid 1 9-inch ditto 17 6-inch ditto 55 Houses drained 121 House drains trapped 3 Cesspools destroyed 119 PAVING. The chief work under this head has been that executed in Bagnigge Wells Road. The heavy and constant expense of maintaining the unpaved portion of this Road with Broken Guernsey Granite, in consequence of the great and increasing railway and other traffic, induced the Vestry to consider the propriety of paving the whole with Granite Cubes, at the estimated cost of £2500. With this view the Saint Pancras Vestry were consulted, (one half of the Road lengthways being in that Parish,) and a mutual agreement was come to that the whole should be paved, each Vestry undertaking a certain length of the Road, to pave and maintain it for 5 years at the least, as an equivalent for that paved and maintained by the other. And under the sanction of the Metropolitan Board of Works, the sum of £2500 has been raised by this Vestry by way of a Loan for 5 years, at 41 per cent interest, and the work has been carried out at the cost, including necessary improvement of the footway in front of Hamilton Row, and Union Terrace; and the carriageway in Guildford Place, of £2864 8s. 4d. LINE OF FRONTAGE. During this year it has devolved upon the Vestry to undertake a public duty, important, not only to this Parish, but to the Metropolis at large, viz., to exercise the power vested in them for the preservation of the line of frontage of the public Streets 5 from encroachment by buildings being erected without the sanction which the Act requires. An application having been made to the Metropolitan Board of Works, for its consent to the erection of a Church at the corner of Penton Street and John Street, Pentonville, the proposal was submitted to this Vestry for approval, and it appearing that such building would project 22-feet 3-inches beyond the line of houses immediately adjoining in Penton Street, the Vestry expressed their objection thereto. The Metropolitan Board also refused its consent. Nevertheless, the building was proceeded with, and the Vestry felt bound to take such steps as were calculated to raise the question of right, without however resorting to extreme measures, but which proved of no avail; and the Metropolitan Board having called the attention of the Vestry to the fact that the building was being proceeded with, notwithstanding the refusal of its consent thereto, the Vestry felt they had no alternative but to take the course prescribed by law, and accordingly they caused so much of the building as infringed on the public rights to be demolished, the result of which was a Chancery suit, which was decided by the Vice Chancellor against the Vestry. The Vestry being advised that such decision was contrary to Law, caused an appeal to be made to the Lord Chancellor, when the judgment of the Vice Chancellor was reversed, and the right of the Vestry established. Annexed is the Balance Sheet for the Year, and the Medical Officer's Report on the Sanitary State of the Parish, to which attention is directed for further and more general information.

To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, I now do myself the honor of laying before you my Fifth Annual Report, upon the Sanitary condition of the District, consisting mainly of a summary of the Reports submitted periodically to your ordinary Meetings. The number of deaths which occurred from all causes during the year was 1383; the average of the last 10 years being 1396 ; so that the deaths were 13 fewer than the average. In 1857, the deaths were 1406; in 1858, 1477; and in 1859, 1374; so that in 1860, the deaths were 9 more than in 1859. Every year, a certain number of the Inhabitants of the District die in General and Special Hospitals, and Lunatic Asylums. The estimated number of these for the past year, amounts to 93, thus producing a total of 1476. The births which took place during the year were 2279; the natural increase of the population thus amounting to 896. In 1859, the births were 2175, and the increase arising from the excess was 801 ; hence 95 less than in the past year. The total number of deaths from Zymotic diseases, according to the old arrangement, was 277; that for 1859, being 331; for 1858, 336; and for 1857, 348. 16 The deaths from the principal Zymotic diseases were 226 against 301 in 1859; 285 in 1858; and 295 in 1857. The comparative numbers of each disease for these years is shown in the following Table:— Small Pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Hooping Cough Diarrhoea. Typhus. Totals. 1857 6 51 42 84 65 47 295 1858 5 69 64 61 55 31 285 1859 9 24 82 87 68 31 301 1860 10 39 50 62 38 27 226 Hence these diseases produced 96 fewer deaths than in 1859; in fact, this is the least mortality from these diseases which has been recorded during the existence of the Vestry. The deaths from Measles were 39, being 15 more than in 1859; in which year, the mortality from Measles was unusually small. The deaths from Scarlet Fever were 50, being 32 fewer than in 1859; of these deaths, 9 were registered as arising from Diphtheria. The deaths from Hooping Cough were 62, being 25 less than in the previous year. Those from Diarrhoea were 38, being 30 less. And those from Typhus, 27, being 4 less than in 1859. To the deaths from Typhus must be added 6 which took place in the Fever Hospital. 624 deaths occurred in infants and children under 5 years of ago. In 1859, there were 628; in 1858, 656; in 1857, 663. 229 deaths took place at and above 60, including 41 at and above 80. 253 deaths arose from Tubercular or Consumptive diseases. 328 deaths arose from Pulmonary diseases. 137 deaths took place in the Workhouse. 15 deaths took place in the House of Correction, the number for the preceding year being 16. 1 death occurred in the House of Detention. These are the most important particulars to be considered in regard to the mortality, upon which I may make a' few comments. 17 Further details of the causes of deaths will be found in the table appended to this Report. The mortality from Zymotic diseases, both collectively and from those especially fatal, has been reduced considerably as shown above. Of the 10 deaths from Small Pox, all occurred in unvaccinated persons, except one—that of a male, age 38, who had been vaccinated in early life, but had not been re-vaccinated; at the same time, this death was probably accelerated by the occupation of an underground kitchen, not habitable according to the Act. 19 cases of Small Pox were sent to the Small Pox Hospital, but no deaths occurred among them; in 1859, 15 cases were sent to the Hospital, and 1 death took place. The deaths from Typhus again exhibit a diminution, which has been progressive during the last 5 years; the deaths registered in the District being respectively for these years, 51, 47, 31, 31, and 27 26 cases were sent by the Guardians of the Poor to the Fever Hospital. In 1859, 23 cases were sent to the Hospital, and of these, 6 died; of the 26 cases sent during the past year, 5 died. The mortality in children under 5 years of age is still enormous, the deaths amounting to 624, not far from half the total mortality ; some share of this mortality is unquestionably beyond the control of the Vestry. The greatest number of deaths in children, both absolutely and relatively, occur among the poorer classes, and arise from want of proper care and management in regard to exercise, diet, and free ventilation, yet protection from cold. Those from brain disease, Convulsions, Atrophy, and Pulmonary diseases, arise mostly from an impaired state of nutrition of the body thus produced, which renders children unable to withstand any malady, and renders medical treatment almost helpless. At the same time, it appears'to me, that the dwellings of the poor are not sufficiently required by the Vestry to be cleansed; nor is the overcrowding sufficiently interfered with; and these are two potent causes of infantine mortality especially. The deaths from Pulmonary disease were 328, against 229 in 1859. The extremely severe winter was quite sufficient to account for this very considerable increase. Tubercular diseases were not so fatal in the last year as in 1859, the numbers being respectively 253, and 269. The deaths in the Workhouse were 137, being 17 more than in 1859. The accidental deaths were 22, against 18 in 1859; 7 arose from "accidental suffocation," 3 from burns and scalds, and 9 from fractures and contusions. Four infants were murdered, the number in 1859 being 5. 9 deaths arose from suicide, against 8 in the preceding year. The deaths from intemperance were 5, against 6 in 1858; although this by no means represents the true number directly and indirectly arising from that cause. 18 Small Pox having been very prevalent throughout the metropolis during the preceding year, the deaths having risen from 247 in 1858, to 1156 in 1859, it was deemed desirable at the suggestion of the Lords of the Privy Council to use every means to prevent the ravages of that terrible disorder. Accordingly hand-bills were ordered by the Vestry to be printed, and everywhere distributed, drawing special attention to the importance of taking advantage of the protective influence of vaccination. Notices of the same kind were also circulated throughout the District by the Board of Guardians of the Poor, and 2 extra vaccinators were appointed. In furtherance of this object, I visited some of the public and private schools, and examined the children to ascertain whether or not they had been vaccinated; in this way, 986 children were examined. 19 cases of Small Pox were sent to the Small Pox Hospital, but no deaths occurred among them. Population.—The census having been taking this year, we are now in a position to be able to determine accurately the relative mortality of the District to the population, or the death-rate. According to the census of 1851, there were 64,778 persons living in the District, these being distributed through the sub-districts as shown in the following table, which exhibits also the population and its distribution in 1861, with the difference in the populations at the two periods:— Population in 1851. 1861. Difference. St. James 21,529 19,152 — 2,377 Amwell 15,720 17,250 x 1,530 Pentonville 11,904 13,079 x 1,175 Goswell 15,625 16,200 x 575 64,778 65,681 x 903 Thus it is seen that in St. James's Sub-district, there is a diminution of 2377, whilst in each of the other sub-districts, there is an increase—in all of 3280; when the diminution is subtracted from the total increase, the true increase of 903 remains. Hence the population has not increased to the extent which was to have been expected; for during the ten years, 1851-61, 22,404 births took place in the entire District; the deaths tor the same period amounting to 14,166, leaving a natural increase of 8238, 903 or about one-ninth only of which have remained in the District. The results of the census showed also, that the number of inhabited houses had diminished by 176; this diminution probably arises from the houses forming the Street and Courts on the west side of Turnmill Street having been pulled down in or about 1854. 19 Taking the present average of 9.3 persons in each house, there must now be 2560 more inhabitants in the same number of houses, than in 1851. The death-rate for the entire district was 2.2 per cent of the population. For the separate sub-districts, the comparative rate in the preceding year was as follows: St. James's, 2.4; Amwell, 1.8; Pentonville, 2.0; and Goswell, 1.9. Having shown that the number of Inhabitants in the District has increased in the last ten years by 903 only, it might appear that my previous remarks upon the existence of overcrowding were not correct; they are so however, in consequence of the very unequal distribution of the Inhabitants through the houses. Very few of the families living in single or even two rooms, so very common an occurrence in the District, have their 300 cubic feet of air-space for each person, as should be the case; hence their health is in danger, more or less according to the extent of time they are confined within the apartments. But should any Zymotic disease make its appearance, then comes a hard struggle for life. This may be illustrated by a case which occurred in the year, although similar ones are common. Five children lived with their parents in a room having only 180 cubic feet of air space each; one child taken suddenly ill, became insensible and died. An inquest was held, as there was nothing apparently to account for death. Shortly, however, the other four and an adult became ill, one after the other, with malignant Scarlet Fever. Two died, and it became evident that the first death had arisen from the overpowering or malignant influence of the morbid poison upon the body preventing the natural signs of the disease from manifesting themselves ; or perhaps more truly, from the influence of the morbid poison upon a malignant state of the body, rendered so by living in an atmosphere loaded with impurity. Water-supply.—I regret that I cannot announce any improvement in the water-supply, many of the Courts have the old standpipes, with the water turned on for half or three quarters of an hour daily, and the underground cisterns; the Inhabitants, who cannot possibly be clean, having to fetch the water at stated and often inconvenient times, and to store it in their miserable dwelling rooms. It is to be hoped that the Local Management Act Amendment may soon pass, when this evil will be remedied. Neither can I congratulate the Vestry upon the erection of Baths and Wash houses ; in fact, the idea seems quite abandoned. All who are in the habit of visiting the dwellings of the poor, must have observed the great deficiency in accommodation for washing and drying linen ; this being mostly effected in very small living rooms, which are thus rendered damp and unhealthy, in addition to the operation being very imperfectly done. One drinking fountain has been erected by the New River Company, at the end of Garnault Place. 20 Underground Kitchens.—No steps have been taken either by the District Surveyor or the Vestry to prevent the occupation of underground kitchens or cellars as dwelling rooms; this is a serious evil, especially where children are brought up in them. I cannot think that there would be any hardship in insisting that no children should be allowed to sleep underground. In a large number of houses in the District, brick drains run beneath the basements , these are in most instances old and decayed, often being rendered pervious by rat-holes. The sewage thus escapes into the soil, and the noxious effluvium is drawn into the room by the heat of the fire, being especially evident in the morning, after the rooms have been shut up during the night. This evil can only be remedied by laying down impervious pipe-drains; but even when this has been down, the noxious emanations are often still evolved; and this, from the old soil saturated with the sewage not having been removed. This is, likewise, a very important point to be attended to, for these emanations are eminently prejudicial to health. House Cleansing.—I wish I could induce the Vestry to insist more upon having the poorer dwellings cleansed—lime-whited. In the reports of the other Medical Officers of the Metropolis, I read that hundreds of these dwellings are cleansed and purified in this way every year, and scarcely a day passes, but what I see in this District, numerous houses which are extremely dark and dirty from the walls and ceilings not having been cleansed for many years. To bring up families amidst this filth and dirt, is to train them to discard the first element of health—cleanliness. Moreover, there is no doubt that infectious matters may be retained and imparted to new occupants by the foul walls of apartments; and as the poor very frequently change their habitations, their is great reason to believe that diseases are often propagated in this way. Vaults of Churches.—Early in the year, an Order in Council was issued to the effect that the coffins in the vaults of St. James's, St. John's, and St. Mark's Churches, and Pentonville Chapel should be distributed over the floors of the vaults, and be covered with charcoal and fresh earth. There has been considerable delay in attending to this order, which has only been carried out as far as concerns St. James's Church, and Pentonville Chapel. It is to be hoped, that the necessary improvements will soon be made in the vaults of the remaining Churches, especially St. John's, where the coffins are very numerous, crowded, and in a state of decay, and where the Church is small; for it is painful to think that the inhabitants in their attendance at a place of worship, should be subjected to the danger of imbibing the seeds of disease, by respiring the noxious effluvia from vaults, which are readily drawn into a heated Church by the rarified state of the air within. Sanitary Improvements.—The following sanitary improvements have been effected during the year 21 24 sewers have been cleansed, 3 repaired; 212 gullies cleansed , 27 repaired, 12 trapped, and 8 new ones constructed; 2 new airshafts have been built; 1 12-inch, 17 9-incli, and 55 6-inch drains have been laid; 121 houses have been drained; 3 house-drains have been trapped ; and 88 cesspools destroyed. In conclusion, I may remark, that the year—in a sanitary point of view—has been favourable. The mortality is below the average, and the number of deaths from Zymotic diseases has been reduced. Undoubtedly had not the winter been so unusually severe, the mortality would have appeared in a still more favourable light. The amount of rain which fell in the year, 32-inches, was considerably above the average of the last 21 years, viz.: 2 3-inches. This has—no doubt—had a beneficial effect, in washing and purifying the air, as also the sewers. I think then, that the Vestry have reason to be satisfied that real sanitary progress has been made; that their labors have not been in vain ; and that the Local Management Act has conferred important benefits upon the community. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. W. GRIFFITH, M.D. November 15, 1861. T. GOODE, Printer, Clekkknwell Green. DEATHS REGISTERED IN CLERKENWELL IN 1860.
