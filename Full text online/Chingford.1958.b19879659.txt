ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR 19 5 8 To: The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Chingford Corporation, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, I have pleasure in submitting my Annual Report for the year 1958 upon the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough. The estimated population for the year was 46,030. Vital Statistics: There was an increase of 12 in the number of births recorded, compared to 1957, notifications rising to 535. The birth rate per 1,000 population was 11.6. The number of deaths was 389, eight fewer than in 1957. The death rate was 8.4 per 1,000. When these birth and death rates are multiplied by the area comparability factor they are comparable with the crude rates for England and Wales or with the adjusted rates for any other area. The table on page 4 gives the birth and death rates, both crude and adjusted, for the past six years, together with the rates for England and Wales. The infant mortality rate was 14.9 per 1,000 live births: the rate for England and Wales was 22.6. Causes of Death: Diseases of the heart and arteries, and cancer, were the principal causes of death, the numbers being 182 and 91 respectively. Infectious Diseases: The incidence of infectious disease remained low. There was a single case of poliomyelitis: full recovery ensued. Dysentery amongst school children was troublesome. There was an appreciable fall in the number of new cases of tuberculosis notified The chiropody service sponsored by the Chingford Old People's Welfare Committee expanded during the year. 2. New Legislation: The Clean Air Act, 1956, and the Slaughterhouses Act, 1958, came into operation during the year. Dr. F.G-. Brown, Area Medical Officer, has kindly supplied the statistical matter on pages 5 and 6. In conclusion, I would like to record my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their support and to the staff of the Department for their co-operation during the year. J. H.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supplies, A hard, pure and constant piped water supply is provided by the Metropolitan Water Board; the supply has been satisfactory in both quality and quantity. Rivers and Streams, Thirty-three visits were made during the year in connection with the pollution of water courses. Informal action secured the abatement of minor instances of pollution. Fly Nuisance. The minor emergence of flies from the waters of the Metropolitan Water Board Reservoirs was again experienced and for the year under review occurred in the vicinity of the William Girling Reservoir, Prompt action by the Water Board was again effective in providing at least temporary relief from the nuisance. Public Cleansing. A weekly collection of refuse and salvage was maintained and the total weight of refuse disposed of at the Works was 11,281 tons as compared with 12,200 tons for the previous year. The Registrar General's estimate of population at the mid-year 1958 indicated a further decline, being 46,030 as against the estimate for mid-year 1957 of 46,450. The number of premises from which refuse was collected showed an increase, being 14,562 as against 14,421 for the previous year. The analysis of income on page 14 reveals a total figure of £12,958 as against £12,398 for the previous year. Whilst the sale of waste paper made a major contribution to this figure, notable sums were also received from the sale of metals, both ferrous and non-ferrous, cullet, bottles, jars and textiles. The net cost per ton for the collection of refuse was 34/6d. as against 3l/8d. for for the year ended March 1958, and 30/-d. for the year ended March 1957• The increase in the unit cost per ton was due to Wage Awards, no additional men being employed during the year. Five refuse collection vehicles were in daily use, with an additional vehicle, a Ford Thames 4 ton vehicle fitted with a 4-cylinder diesel engine and a 15 cu. yd. "Eagle" Derby type body. 11. One replacement vehicle was also purchased during the year, and this also was fitted with a diesel engine. The net cost per ton for the disposal of refuse was 5/lOd. as compared with 5/9d. in the previous year and 6/lOd. for the year ended March 1957. The net expenditure for the collection and disposal of refuse and salvage, including loan charges, was £22,751 or 40/4d. per ton as against £22,862 or 37/5d, per ton for the previous year. The three 24-cell Morrison Electric Trucks used in connection with street cleansing, continue to function satisfactorily. They have now been in continuous use for six years and have fully justified their provision for the economic and efficient carrying out of this service. Repairs items for the year 1958/59 show a decrease due to the fact that repainting of the three vehicles was not carried out.

Swimming Fool Summaries of the total chlorine and alkalinity readings are forwarded weekly to the Health Department by the Borough Engineer. The pool was opened on the 10th May and closed on the 14th September 1958. The total attendance throughout the season was 121,205, the highest attendance being on the 9the July 1958, when 5,337 persons were present. Samples of water were taken from the Pool on six occasions during the period May to September and the results in five cases 22, indicated that the water was of a high standard of bacterial purity; in one case, owing to very high bathing loads and exceptionally hot weather, the quality of the water deteriorated slightly, although the bacteriologist certified it to be suitable for bathing purposes. Schools, The general condition and supply of water to schools has been satisfactory during the year. Co-operation continued with the School Medical Officer and reports were forwarded to that Officer following quarterly visits paid to the canteens attached to all Schools, During the year continued progress was made in the execution of works of repair and maintenance. Offensive Trades. Within the meaning of the Public Health Act there are no offensive trade premises in the district but there are eight fish fryers. The number of visits made to fish shops was 85. Bakehouses, Twenty-three visits were paid to the six bakehouses in the district and generally they were maintained in a satisfactory condition. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949.

SECTION E INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD Milk Supply The milk supply is from several large firms v/ith dairy premises outside the Borough boundaries and mainly pasteurised. Twelve samples of milk were analysed during the year and all were certified to be genuine, Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1949. Graded Milks - The following table shows the licences granted during the year for the sale of milk under the special, designations as provided by the above Regulations:- 7 dealers' licences to sell milk as Pasteurised, 12 ” ” ” ” ” Sterilised. 3 supplementary licences to sell milk as Pasteurised, 4 ” ” ” ” ” Sterilised. 6 dealers' licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested, 1 supplementary licence to sell milk as 'Tuberculin Tested, 1 ” ” ” ” ” (Pasteurised), Food and Drugs Act. 1955 Food and Drugs Authority The Council is the Food and Drugs Authority for the district and during the year samples approximating in number to two per thousand of the population were taken and submitted to the joint Public Analysts. Public Analyst Mr, George Taylor, F.R.I.C., 20 Eastcheap, London, E.C.3. and Dr. J, H. Hamence, F.R.I.C., 20 Eastcheap, London, E.C.3. continued as Joint Public Analysts for the area. Samples submitted for Analysis 111 samples of food and drugs were submitted for analysis, 58 formal and 53 informal and it will be seen by the following table that a reasonably wide field was covered. The table shows that two samples were reported upon adversely. 28 . The Public Analyst commented adversely on a sample of what is popularly termed dehydrated soup, and in connection with one sample taken during the year reported that the soup when prepared in the manner of directions would contain only 0.6% of lean chicken meat and this quantity, in his opinion, was inadequate to justify the description "Super Chicken Noodle Soup", Some consideration was given to the question of legal proceedings on the grounds that the label was misleading, but in the absence of any official standard it was decided to refer the matter to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Such soups are very popular v/ith the public and the artificial chicken flavouring provides a most palatable articles. Nevertheless, a sample of tinned plain chicken soup would normally give at least 20% of chicken meat compared with 0. 6% in the new popular form. Part of a white loaf submitted for analysis because it was thought by a householder to contain rodent excreta was found on analysis to be contaminated by blackened or charred dough. This complaint was taken up with the manufacturers. 29.

It is now eight years since the last case was recorded in the borough,, Primary and secondary immunisation against this disease was carried out to the following extent in children under 15 years of age:- Primary immunisations - under 5 years 494 " " 5 to 15 years 30 Total 524 Number receiving secondary or reinforcing injections - 258 Scarlet Fever All the 37 notified cases of this disease were mild in character: in no instance was it necessary to admit to hospital. The following table indicates the cases notified during the past five years and the percentage of cases removed to hospital 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 Confirmed cases 64 33 65 54 37 Percentage removed to hospital 17 27 26 9 nil Measles There were 214 cases compared to 870 in the previous year: no hospital admissions were necessary. Measles serum was available to medical practitioners on application to the Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, for the treatment of cases and protection of contacts. Whooping Cough An extremely low incidence of this disease was recorded during the year: 8 cases only were notified. Immunisation against this condition proceeded satisfactorily, 321 children receiving a full course in the year. 37. Acute Poliomyelitis It is most satisfactory to record that there was only a single case of poliomyelitis in the borough, this case being of the paralytic type; full recovery took place. Vaccination against this disease, first introduced in 1956, has expanded considerably; no less than 3,762 persons being vaccinated compared to 1,249 in 1957. There were 123 reinforcing injections given in addition. Tuberculosis 17 new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis and 1 case of non-pulmonary tuberculosis were notified among residents during the year. There were, in addition, 23 established cases of tuberculosis originally acquired in other areas who moved into the district. Three persons died from this condition. Although the total number of fresh cases of tuberculosis in the country generally has been falling each year for the past decade, there are no grounds for complacency when it is remembered that in 1958 this number was 26,595. B.C.G. vaccination of school children resulted in 300 children being protected out of 539 whose parents were asked to give consent. The Walthamstow and Chingford Association of Tuberculosis Care Helpers gave assistance wherever possible to patients and their families who suffered financial loss through the need for prolonged treatment at home or in hospital. This assistance was mostly in the form of groceries, fuel, clothing and holidays. The contribution which the Chingford Borough Council makes annually to this Association is very much appreciated. Dysentery A small outbreak of dysentery at one of the schools in the borough in the early part of the year accounted for the 23 cases which were notified. This disease, Which is mild, has a great nuisance value, necessitating absence from school for a considerable number of children. It has been found that the segregation of healthy carriers has done little to control the spread of infection - good results are much more likely to ensue by a rigid attention to personal hygiene, more particularly the washing of hands after each visit to the toilet and before preparing or eating food. 38. Food Poisoning Of the 10 cases of food poisoning notified during the year, it was possible to identify the causal organism in 9 of the. Food Hygiene The Health Inspectors maintained close liaison with all food premises in the borough. Vaccination 424 persons received primary vaccination and 200 were revaccinated against smallpox during the year. Accidents in the Home - "Guard that Fire" Campaign During November a national campaign, sponsored by the Home Office, was initiated to reduce the risk of accidents in the home caused by open and unguarded fires with particular emphasis on the risk to young children and old persons. All local authorities supported this campaign by the provision of posters, leaflets and press publicity, National Assistance Act, 1948 (a) Section 47: Care of Aged and Chronic Sick. There were no cases needing statutory action under this section. Hospital accommodation, or accommodation in hostels for the aged, was arranged for several aged and infirm persons. In a few other instances the provision of a home help obviated the need for hospital care. (b) Section 50: No burials needed to be arranged by the Council under Section 50. Medical Examinations During the year 36 examinations were carried out by me in respect of Chingford Council staff and 38 in respect of staff of the Essex County Council. 39.
