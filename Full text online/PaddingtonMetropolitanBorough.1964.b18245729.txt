The Report of the Medical Officer of Health of Paddington has been presented annually since the formation of the Borough in 1900. However, consequent upon the amalgamation of Paddington, St. Marylebone and Westminster to form the new City of Westminster, this will, of course, be the final report of the series emanating from the Metropolitan Borough of Paddington. (1) Vital Statistics Although the last Census showed that Paddington is still the most densely populated Metropolitan Borough, it is interesting to note that the population has fallen from 143,976 in 1901 to 117,050 in 1964. During the last war the population fell as low as 77,640 in 1941, but by 1950 had risen to 130,600. Subsequently, there was a continuing decline in population to 113,350 in 1960, but by 1964 the population of Paddington had risen to 117,050. In large measure the 1964 figure is explained by the fact that the rehousing programme is now overtaking the extensive slum clearance operations of recent years. The Death Rate per 1,000 population is 9.3, which is the lowest recorded in the history of Paddington and may be compared with the figure of 15.00 in 1901. Unhappily in reverse, in 1964 there were no less than 65 deaths recorded as due to malignant neoplasm of the lung, whilst in 1901 only 3 deaths were recorded from this disease. The Illegitimate Birth Rate remains high, viz, 23 per cent (cf. 24 per cent in 1963). As would be expected the mortality figure of illegitimate deaths of infants compares unfavourably with legitimate deaths, thus:— Deaths of Infants under 4 weeks—Legitimate 18, Illegitimate 9; Deaths of Infants under 1 year—Legitimate 23, Illegitimate 12. There has been an outstanding reduction in the number of deaths from Tuberculosis since the first report of the Medical Officer of Health. Thus in 1901 there were no less than 223 deaths from Tuberculosis, whereas in 1964 only 9 deaths were occasioned by this disease. (2) Infectious Disease The incidence of infectious disease in the Borough throughout the year has again been minimal. It is pleasing to note that there has been no case of Diphtheria in the Borough of Paddington since 1961. In 1901 there were no less than 338 cases of Diphtheria in the Borough, occasioning 46 deaths. 4 This dramatic improvement is, of course, in very large meaaure due to the successful diphtheria immunisation scheme of the London County Council. (3) Housing Act, 1961 Again I make particular reference to the Housing Act, 1961, and on which I have reported in detail in the body of the report. This work has gained in momentum throughout the year, and the intensive work involved has already shown excellent results. I congratulate the team of officers engaged in these duties in their achievements. Housing is, of course, of paramount importance in Paddington. (4) Other Reports I include the reports of the Borough Analyst (Mr. Marshall) and the Borough Welfare Officer (Miss Harrison) and to both I would like to draw the special attention of the Council. (5) Staff At the time of writing most of my staff are already transferred to the new City of Westminster. I am confident that they will meet this new challenge with success, and prove themselves loyal and valuable officers to their new authority. I wish them all every happiness. In particular I mention and congratulate Mr. Pike and Mr. Parker, who as a result of their experience and excellent achievements in Paddington, have respectively been appointed Chief Public Health Inspector, and Deputy Chief Administrative Officer in the Health Department of the new City of Westminster. (6) Conclusion In concluding my last of over 30 annual reports which I have had the honour of presenting as Metropolitan Medical Officer of Health to Paddington and Hampstead, I would like to express my gratitude for the help and co-operation I have received from the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee, the Chief Officers of the Council, and in particular to all the staff of the Public Health Department. I have the honour to be Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H. LESLIE OLDERSHAW, Medical Officer of Health. July, 1965. 5 PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE (at 31st December, 1964), Clr.

The Public Health Inspectors visited no less than 600 premises where tinned corned beef and tongue was sold to ascertain whether certain brands specified by the Ministry were in their possession. As a result 59 tins of corned beef were referred back to the wholesalers by the retailers; a procedure directed by the Ministry.

Food Poisoning.—The Food Inspector made 73 (51) visits in connection with enquiries into cases of food poisoning or suspected food poisoning. SEWAGE.—The Minister of Health has requested that this Report should indicate whether the arrangements for sewerage and sewage disposal in the district are reasonably adequate. I have consulted the Borough Engineer & Surveyor and he informs me that the County Council sewers crossing the Borough do become surcharged on occasions, and under these conditions are unable to accept the discharge from the Borough Council sewers. This problem, of course, also affects other Boroughs and the County Council are supplied with full details to assist them in dealing with the problem. The disposal of sewage is a matter for which the London County Council are responsible. The sewage from Paddington goes to the Northern Outfall Works at Beckton. At these works the sewage is treated and separatedinto effluent sufficiently pure to be discharged into the Thames, and sludge which is disposed of at sea. RODENT CONTROL.—The following table gives details of the work carried out under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, during the year:— Dwelling Houses All other property Total Number of properties in district 32,318 (32,070) 5,371 (5,863) 37,689 (37.933) Numberof properties inspected as a result of— (a) Notification 464 (443) 89 (85) 553 (528) (b) Survey 135 (118) 4 (3) 139 (121) (c) Otherwise — (–) — (–) — (–) Total inspections and re-inspections 3,073 (2,899) 640 (594) 3,713 (3,493) Number of properties found to be infested by— (a) Rats— Major infestation 1 (—) — (—) — (—) Minor infestation 127 (165) 26 (31) 15 (196) (b) Mice— Major infestation — (—) — (—) — (—) Minor infestation 242 (248) 57 (51) 299 (299) Number of infested properties treated by the Council 433 (413) 85 (81) 518 (494) Total treatments and re-treatments 499 (462) 109 (90) 608 (552) 23 It was not found necessary to serve any notices under the Act. The sewers in the Borough were treated twice during the year. WATER SUPPLY.—All drinking water in the Borough is supplied from the Metropolitan Water Board's mains and the Director of Water Examination (E. Windle Taylor, C.B.E., M.A., M.D., D.P.H., M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P.), has kindly supplied the following report and figures. The water is derived from the River Thames, stored in the Board's reservoirs in the Thames Valley and filtered and chlorinated at the Board's works at Hampton and Ashford Common. The water supplied to the Borough during 1964 was satisfactory, both in quality and quantity. There were no new sources of supply instituted by the Metropolitan Water Board during the year, nor any new important extensions of trunk mains. The general scheme of supply was the same as during 1963 but 853 yards of service main were laid in Paddington during 1964.

This is due no doubt to the absence of appropriate weather conditions, although the continued decline in the amount of smoke emitted may well have played an important part, particularly at critical periods. The decline is due principally to the continued introduction of Smoke Control areas assisted by the control of new furnaces, the improvement of existing industrial and commercial heating arrangements and the now almost complete elimination of coal-fired locomotives operating from Paddington Station. The sulphur dioxide concentration is unchanged. The Clean Air Act does not offer controls for emissions of this gas, although indirectly it does make a contribution. In Smoke Control areas the replacement of coal fires by modern appliances burning smokeless fuel efficiently means a smaller fuel consumption, which reduces the SO2 in direct proportion, and if the coal fires are replaced by electric or gas fires, which emit no SO2, or fires burning light oils, which emit only minute amounts, the reduction is even greater. Similarly, improved heating arrangements in commercial and industrial premises reduce fuel demand and therefore SO2 production. This reduction is, however, offset by higher consumption necessitated by the demand for increased heating facilities and by the replacement of low or no sulphur fuels by fuels of comparatively high sulphur content. Smoke control areas.—The Council's revised programme envisages that the whole Borough will be a smokeless zone by 1968. The present position is as follows: — Hyde Park No. 1 Order. Confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and in operation from the 31st October, 1959. Lancaster Gate East Order. Confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and in operation from the 1st November, 1960. Lancaster Gate West Order.

Confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and in operation from the 1st July, 1965. Harrow Road South Order. Preliminary survey is being carried out. Hyde Park No. 2 and Reading Orders. The surveys for both these areas have been completed. Smoke Control Orders will be made when the extensive redevelopment schemes in these areas have reached an appropriate stage. 25 Measurement of atmospheric pollution.—The results obtained from the recording apparatus at the Welfare Centre, 283a, Harrow Road, during 1964 are given below.

(b) The equivalent of two sessions per week at a clinic at Leonora House. (c) Some 750 treatments at the homes of the housebound. The London County Council hold a foot clinic at the Welfare Centre, 283a Harrow Road, on seven occasions each week. These clinics are not exclusively for the elderly. Recreational Centres.—A number of clubs for the elderly are organised by the Women's Voluntary Services, the Salvation Army and the Paddington Old People's Welfare Committee. Three of the clubs provide meals, one each by the aforementioned organisations. HOUSING (FINANCIAL PROVISIONS) ACT, 1958 AND HOUSE PURCHASE AND HOUSING ACT, 1959 When applications are made to the Council for either discretionary or standard Improvement Grants the Public Health Department is asked to comment on the scheme submitted. If a grant is made, any works carried out have to be to the satisfaction of this department so far as public health matters are involved, e.g. drainage, underground rooms. During 1964 the department's comments were invited upon 57 (78) applications, but not all of these were proceeded with. The department is also asked to supply information regarding the property (the existence of closing orders; permitted numbers, etc.) before the Council considers applications for loans for house purchase, and 103 (108) such cases were dealt with during the year. HOUSING Housing Act, 1957—Overcrowding (a) (1) Number of dwellings overcrowded at the end of the year 331 (136) (2) Number of families dwelling therein 332 (137) (3) Number of persons dwelling therein 1422 (594£) (Units) (b) Number of new cases of overcrowding ported during the year 254 (58) (c) (1) Number of cases of overcrowding lieved during the year 55 (42) (2) Number of persons concerned in such cases 234½ (169|) (Units) (d) Particulars of any cases in which dwelling houses have again become overcrowded after the Local Authority have taken steps for the abatement of overcrowding Nil (Nil) The number of overcrowded dwellings on the Register of Overcrowding at the end of 1964 was 331 (136). There were 95 (39) basement dwellings on the Register. Of the cases of overcrowding 29 relieved during the year 11 (3) were rehoused by the London County Council, 14 (9) were provided with accommodation by the Borough Council, 29 (24) secured accommodation privately and 1 (6) were relieved by a natural reduction in the size of the family or on obtaining additional accommodation. The numbers on the register are not of course total cases of overcrowding, as many cases do not come to our notice. The practice of sending warning letters to owners against permitting the premises to become again overcrowded has been continued in all known cases where overcrowding has been abated. Section 80 of the Housing Act, 1957 gives a local authority power, where they are satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which make it expedient to do so, to allow the temporary use of a house by persons in excess of the permitted number. During the year the Council issued nil (1) licence under this section. During the year a total of 257 (147) Paddington families were rehoused by the London County Council and 135 (194) by the Borough Council. Housing Accommodation—Preferential Treatment During the year 341 (241) medical certificates were referred to me by the Borough Director of Housing for "pointing." Points are awarded for certified ill-health, and if the applicant's health is affected by his living conditions the Public Health Department investigates these conditions and in many instances is able to get them remedied. Houses Unfit for Human Habitation No. of basement rooms dealt with by closing orders 26 (59) No. of upper rooms closed 3 (3) No. of mews premises closed – (20) No. of houses dealt with by closing orders in lieu of demolition orders 1 (–) No. of houses dealt with by demolition orders or in respect of which undertakings were accepted – (–) Nil (52) persons were displaced as a result of the Council's operations. Closing Orders were determined or undertakings cancelled on 50 (72) basement rooms, 6 upper parts and 3 mews premises. New Accommodation During the year the Council completed nil (8) new flats. HOUSING ACTS, 1961/64 Although the Housing Act, 1964, passed by Parliament on the 16th July provided the opportunity of using a new approach in a number of cases, and indeed considerably strengthened the position legally, the difficulties of the Paddington Borough Council in fully implementing all the available powers, referred to in my Reports of 1962 and 1963, still remained. Part IV of the new Act amended the 1961 Act as follows:— (1) Expenses incurred by a local authority in carrying out works in default of an owner under the 1961 Act became a charge on the premises to which the notice related, and on all estates and interests therein. 30 (2) Penalties for failure to execute works were widened to include cases where the local authority had provided additional amenities or means of escape in case of fire, in the owner's default. (3) The local authority were empowered to require the execution of works in over-crowded houses or, at the same time, give a direction to the owner as to the number of persons who might occupy the house when the specified works had been carried out. (4) A more satisfactory power of entry to local authority inspectors was included, that had been lacking in earlier legislation. (5) A management code was made available for use in connection with certain tenement blocks. (6) The local authority were empowered to register houses in multiple occupation at their discretion without delay. The 1961 Act had given a future date when local authorities might cause a registration of these houses; the new 1964 Act took away the operative date and gave the local authority the power to do it straight away if they wished. Important new provisions were contained in the Act, viz:— (i) The power to require compulsory improvement of dwellings by declaring "Improvement Areas". (ii) The power to make a "Control Order" where a house let in lodgings is either already subject to a notice served in relation to Part II of the 1961 Act, or is susceptible to such action, and in addition if it appears to the local authority that the living conditions in the house are such that a control order is necessary to protect the safety, welfare or health of persons living in the house. The high degree of intense multiple occupation in existence in the Borough presents a situation that is incapable of being solved rapidly, as it is coupled with the necessity to accomplish a state of affairs whereby all dwellings are occupied within reasonable limits. This would entail a reduction of the number of one- or two-roomed lettings, and the redevelopment or conversion of many of the "rooming houses". I find it difficult to imagine this being effectively achieved by individual owners either voluntarily or following statutory action by the Council using the available Housing Act powers. Local Authorities have no ordinary powers to direct an owner of a house how it shall be let. With the high inflated values of property in the Central West London area, however, and the clamour for rented accommodation, there is a human temptation for owners to sub-let so as to extract the maximum rent potential from a house irrespective of the numbers it is at the moment reasonably capable of accommodating. It must be realised there are considerations other than the provision of a separate sink, hot water supply, cooking and food storage accommodation, with communal water-closet and bath facilities. These latter are basic requirements to ensure a reasonable standard of living for the occupants. I suggest that it is equally important that such houses should provide dwellings that 31 represent "homes" to the families who by chance or circumstances have to occupy them, not just "units of accommodation". Domestic happiness and contentment of mind are associated with good housing conditions, and this is a factor of particular importance when considering the problems of immigrant families, so many of whom have a feeling of insecurity in their new surroundings. This feeling is encouraged when families are "living in each other's pockets" in cramped over-crowded houses with communal activities. However, it is true that a local authority now has legal powers to deal effectively with the worst cases of multi-occupation including the power to control a house promptly where it has become apparent that the safety, welfare or health of the occupants are in jeopardy. These are the "Control Order" powers I have already referred to. It is a drastic step and is intended obviously to be used with discretion in selected cases where other sections of the Housing Acts would not provide a quick or effective remedy. The three cases dealt with by the Council so far have illustrated clearly the severe administrative burden entailed, but have also shown how effective the powers can be when undertaken in those cases calling for swift action. The four Housing teams referred to in my 1963 report have operated in four selected areas of the Borough as follows: — Area 1 is centred around St. Stephen's Gardens, which had received somewhat exaggerated publicity and had been associated with "Rachmanism". As a first priority, the Council had instructed that a "house to house" survey of St. Stephen's Gardens be carried out and as a result Management Orders and Section 19 (Limits) be applied where indicated. Area 2 includes Ashmore, Portnall and Bravington Roads in North Paddington. These are smaller houses by comparison and are mainly multi-racially occupied. Again, Management Orders and Limits have been made and a large number of these houses have been purchased for the occupation of the owner and his family with the assistance of a Council loan. It is the Inspector's aim, in this area in particular, to discuss the position first of all with the owner to endeavour to achieve in suitable houses a thoroughgoing conversion that will attract an improvement grant. Area 3 is bounded by Shirland Road, Chippenham Road, Harrow Road and Sutherland Avenue. The procedure for inspection and subsequent action is as Area 2, although the properties, particularly in Sutherland Avenue, are larger. Area 4 consists of certain selected roads in the Westbourne Ward. There are indications that formal action may be the rule rather than the exception although an initial approach to the owner is always made. I also submit a statistical summary of the work carried out by the Inspectors during the year. 32 I have made it clear that there is a restriction on the impact that can be made in the situation because of an absence of alternative housing accommodation. Bearing this in mind, it gives me much pleasure to record in this, my last, report to the Borough, not only the cases that were successfully dealt with by the Housing Inspectors, but the fact that the methods adopted have proved satisfactory and will provide the new City of Westminster with a competent and experienced section which, given the opportunity, will be able to attack the problem of unsatisfactory over-occupation and mismanagement of multi-occupied houses that was to Paddington, and will continue to be for the new City, its major public health housing problem.

H. E. Marshall, M.A., F.R.I.C.) for the year ended 31st December, 1964 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Paddington. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, During the year under review the total number of samples submitted was again 500. Of these 486 were obtained under the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, and the remainder (14) were complaint samples. Of these fourteen, four were without justification but all were the subjects of special reports. The complaints not justified were:—pineapple alleged to be over-ripe; kippers and sausages alleged to have an unusual smell and a dirty milk bottle where the dirt was on the outside of the bottle and not on the inside. The complaints which were justified were as follows: —a sample of lard where the manufacturers admitted the possibility of a breakdown in the deodorising plant. The taint from this lard persisted into a portion of mince tart made with it. Canned spinach was gritty. Some rashers of bacon had picked up some of the greasy dirt from the slicing machine. A meringue had probably been made in a dirty meringue-making machine. Some cooked pheasant had a smell of petrol and there were five samples of milk in milk bottles all of which contained residues of dirt. The fact that there were only six complaints due to dirty milk bottles reflects very great credit on the milk producers supplying Paddington with literally millions of bottles in the course of a year, for the public nowadays are sufficiently cleanliness-conscious to make known their grievances. Of the eighteen samples about which adverse reports were made, twelve were due to inadequate or inaccurate labels. A can of pike dumpling and a sample of gherkins were insufficiently labelled. A sample of strawberry jam contained redcurrants but the confusion was due to an overprinted label. Two samples of instant coffee did not bear the usual declaration of ingredients "Soluble solids of pure coffee". However, this declaration of ingredients was the one used to describe a sample of decaffeinated instant coffee and if the description is true in one case, it must be false in the other. The label of a sample of guava jelly depicted many fruits but no guavas. A sample of cheese sauce had been made with skimmed milk and it was difficult to reconcile the analytical figure with the description "Concentrated" which appeared on the label. A further direction on the label recommended that the sauce should then be sprinkled with grated cheese! A sample of dried fruit was infested. A sample of "homogenised" milk was not homogenised. A sample of honey showed evidence of the presence of added invert sugar. A sample of cauliflower in brine contained prohibitive preservative and a sample of sausages contained preservative, the presence of which was not 35 declared, nor was the usual declaration exhibited in the shop. A sample of meat balls did not declare all the ingredients, where mention of the starchy filler was omitted. A sample of cough mixture contained more dilute acetic acid than was declared. The ingredients in a sample of canned fruit salad were not present in the order in which they were declared on the label. The Labelling of Food Order requires the ingredients to be listed in the descending order of magnitude. Certain ingredients declared to be present in a can of picnic anti-pasto were, in fact, not present. Finally, the contents of a can of sliced roast beef in rich gravy did not resemble the picture on the lid. On the lid the slices were shown clean whereas in the can they were sodden with gravy. Furthermore, the meat content was considerably below the standard recently accepted by a Court judgment for this type of article. New legislation introduced during 1964 included the following quite important measures. The Meat Treatment Regulations which prohibited the addition to raw meat of ascorbic and nicotinic acids and their salts. The Soft Drinks Regulations extend the requirements in respect of composition, sugar and fruit content, artificial sweeteners and labelling, together with the requirements when sold from vending machines. The Dried Milk Regulations specify the composition and description of dried milk. Regulations were introduced to abandon the Imperial system of prescribing drugs in favour of the metric system. One measure which could have far-reaching results was the issue in December, 1964, of a Circular by the Minister of Health entitled "Procuring Samples of Drugs". This reminds sampling officers of their powers under various existing statutes to be supplied with drugs normally obtainable only on prescription. While this could give your Analyst the opportunity to examine a far greater number of drugs in respect of their purity and accuracy of composition, new legislation unifying the various aspects of the control of medicines, drugs and poisons would be welcome. However, the full effect of this directive to sampling Officers will not fall on the Public Health Department of the Metropolitan Borough of Paddington but on the New City of Westminster. I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the Medical Officer of Health for his kindness and courtesy towards me which, indeed, I have experienced from all Officers of the Paddington Borough Council. Particularly may I express my appreciation of the consideration and forebearance shown me on all occasions by Mr. Harrison, your Sampling Officer, during the years of my service to you as your Public Analyst. Like many others, I regret the passing of Paddington, but look forward with confidence to a period of happy association with the New Westminster. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. H. E. Marshall, Public Analyst. 36 Report of the Welfare Officer (Miss I. O. D. Harrison, S.S.D.) At the end of 1964 I had completed five years in the appointment I now hold. Social situations are not static and it is now of interest to reflect on and compare the problems and situations that have arisen during this period, and to consider the trends and changes in attitudes and behaviour that have taken place, not only among immigrants but also among the indigenous population. In view of the pending amalgamation of the London Boroughs, which means that this will be the last annual report I will submit to Paddington Borough Council as such, it is possibly an appropriate time to discuss the development of my work during this period. Broadly speaking it has had four main aspects. 1. Concern with the individual and personal problems of immigrants. Some of these arise from difficulties of adaptation from rural and sometimes backward societies to a highly industrialised and complex one, and others arise as a result of the differences in habits, customs and behaviour patterns of the territories from which they come, which naturally are brought here with them, and for which there is no appropriate social service equipped or able to assist. 2. Concern with problems of indigenous people which involve or concern immigrants, and which, again, are not appropriate to the existing social services. (Both of these categories have included problems of accommodation, misunderstanding or friction between individuals of the same and different groups, and, of course, landlord-tenant difficulties.) 3. Assistance with Community and Group problems, which can arise from the presence of numbers of immigrants in a community, especially immigrants who are patently different. This category has included problems resulting from incompatability, ignorance, misunderstanding, discrimination and prejudice and can affect either or both groups. This category I have always regarded as particularly important, as not only does it concern problems which are now with us, and which, if not given careful attention, may develop into situations which result in lasting attitudes and beliefs, but also because full understanding of the community and its members is essential if we wish to foresee, anticipate and, more particularly, avert certain problems arising in the future. This aspect of my work has entailed learning as much as possible about what is happening in the area and attempting to keep abreast of current interests and opinions. It is important to know, not only people who have problems, or who themselves are problems, but also people who do not have the difficulties which bring them to the attention of the social services. All such people comprise a community and the needs of all must be considered. In this connection it has been necessary to liaise with the existing services and interested bodies and, of course, a great deal of home visitation and even doorstep conversation has been called for. 37 4. Clearly any officer in the field of race relations, and particularly a social worker, cannot afford to be parochial. Consequently the last main category of my work has been to continue the process of my own education in the field, and this entails membership of committees, attendance at conferences, discussion groups and the like, on all aspects of the problems and to keep myself informed of developments which have direct or indirect bearing on my work. The exchange and cross fertilisation of ideas is not only stimulating but essential in the delicate field of race relations. As my appointment was a pioneering one, I am sometimes asked to speak at conferences and address groups and meetings. Despite the passage of time it is gratifying to know that Paddington is recognised as a Borough which had sufficient understanding to tackle the problems of integration as long ago as they did. At this point I would wish to thank the Council for granting me some leave to enable me to attend a United Nations Seminar in Madrid earlier this year on the "Problems of Migrant Workers". I attended as a delegate of Great Britain, but was listed additionally as an officer engaged by Paddington Borough Council. It will be appreciated that there are still no means of obtaining precise figures of the racial composition of the Borough, white or coloured. However, I am fairly certain that the numbers of Commonwealth immigrants who are coloured coming to the Borough, having just arrived in the country are considerably less than during the previous years. Of those that have come, the majority have been dependants joining their families; or students. There would, of course, have been a natural increase from all groups, and there would also have been immigrants coming to the Borough from other parts of the city (or country), counterbalanced by the people who, for various reasons, have moved out. A weakness in the Commonwealth Immigrant's Bill as a means of control of entry must be well known. While it is true that it is difficult to know how many people have entered illegally, I would think that the groups most guilty of this offence would not be West Indians, and as it is they who comprise the largest group of Commonwealth immigrants in the Borough, our numbers would not be affected appreciably by this situation. Problems arising from shortage of accommodation were again high on the list during the last year. Securing accommodation at an economic rent is as difficult as ever, and this applies even more in the case of people who are coloured, and who are, unfortunately, accepted only in certain places. Migrants who were new in the district when I first took up my appointment now have families which are growing, and this means their housing problems are more acute. Those with limited incomes live in extremely bad circumstances, and this is a particular problem for the mother without a father supporting the children. Apart from the frustration and hardship that the mother has to endure, I am extremely perturbed at what must inevitably be the result on the children who are thus restricted and confined. Opportunities in the home for play, study or leisure activities are non-existent, and this is often additionally complicated by the fact 38 that the children sleep not only in living rooms shared by brothers and sisters, but also by adults who may not be parents. Affluence in this country has faded the memory of working class mothers on extremely limited incomes, trying to live with dignity under these circumstances while keeping the children clean, respectably clothed and adequately fed. This is just what many West Indian mothers that I meet are doing and I am impressed by their courage. During the time I have been in this appointment more and more houses in the district have been put up for sale, and of these a very large number have been bought by immigrants. It is inevitable, therefore, that among the unsatisfactory landlord occupiers a number will be immigrants. This may appear to be an inflammatory remark but in view of the fact that the awaited report of the Milner Holland Committee is likely to confirm this, I feel it needs to be said and an explanation of this situation given. In this Borough many of the houses in question are the large properties that for many years have been multi-occupied. In the past the landlord has not usually been an occupier, and separate floors were generally occupied by separate families. As these rooms, or floors became vacant they were often filled on the recommendation of other tenants in the house or street, and nearly always by people of similar background. In recent years, and with the sharp rise in prices of houses, those with controlled tenants in occupation have been put on the market as soon as a "flat" or rooms have become vacant. With the influx of immigrants, whose need for accommodation has been particularly acute, there has been a ready market for these properties, which are within the price range they can aspire to, despite the fact they may be lacking in amenities. Indigenous people, of course, have the same opportunities for buying them but tend not to be interested. It is inevitable that with limited accommodation and shared amenities and the sometimes unrealistic rents of controlled tenants, many of the landlords come rapidly to resent their tenants. Situations of this kind are sometimes exacerbated by differences in habits and behaviour, or by apprehension, fear and sometimes prejudice, on either or both sides. A great deal of my time is spent trying to ease situations of this kind, which often become so complex that it is difficult, if not impossible to decide just where the blame lies. It also has to be remembered that many controlled tenants are themselves living in crowded conditions and have been on housing lists for long periods with no immediate hope of being assisted. Reflecting on the neighbourhood situation for the period I have been in the post, one of the interesting developments has been that, in the earlier years, when an immigrant bought a house (frequently on a group basis) it was often easily identified by the apparent lack of interest in the outside appearance of the property, the windows and common usage parts generally. But there has been a rather dramatic change, and they are now more frequently 39 fied by the general "smartening up" of the property, not only outside, but also inside. Paradoxically, where it used to be a cause of friction that the houses of immigrants were neglected in appearance, the reverse situation now sometimes gives rise to tension. The tenants in the house sometimes mistrust the "all-out" attempt of the landlord to effect improvements and changes, thinking them to be a means to speculate, or they resent his "intrusion" into their apartments to effect these repairs and decorations. The landlords, on the other hand, tend to be contemptuous of people who they see as being content to live in shabby and drab surroundings. Petty persecutions still abound in landlord tenant tensions, and are often of a nature that they cannot be resolved by court action, which is why so many such cases are brought to me in the hope that persuasion will be effective. Complications arising from common law unions, extra marital relations and previous histories of couples who are marrying still feature on the list of problems brought to my attention. I am beginning to see more hopeful signs about this situation, however. With the increasingly "Londonisation" of the womenfolk, there is an appreciation on their part that they in fact hold the key to the eventual solution. There are signs that they are beginning to consider themselves as social equals of the menfolk. During the last year I have also found there are more women who are prepared to take erring menfolk to court on grounds of desertion and for paternity orders. In this context, another interesting change I have noted during my period in this work is the gradual adoption by the women of modern European fashions and hairstyles suitably adapted to individual personalities. It is with some amusement, I remember, it used to be that some European men were apprehensive less the migrant men should pay attention to their womenfolk and that the women might find them attractive, whereas now there are similar signs of apprehension among some of the European women as they see the blossoming and increasing sophistication of the West Indian girls, and the effect that this is having on all normal males (coloured and white). Another problem requiring attention is that of the children who are brought from the West Indies by a mother or father who has now formed a permanent union or marriage in this country. The children coming over, who are the result of earlier unions, are sometimes rejected by the parent who has now become a stranger or by the partner who is not the parent. The situation can be further complicated by the fact that when the children (who are generally older) attend school they very soon adopt the customs and attitudes of indigenous children, and in consequence do not always give the "new" parent figure the respect which he feels is his due in view of the sacrifice made to bring the child over. This is a problem of adaptation; but, nevertheless, it can be emotionally extremely painful to all concerned, and even disrupt a hitherto happy family unit. 40 At the time of writing this report the question of restriction of immigrants is being hotly debated and reported upon. While not wishing to comment on this question, I feel it right to mention that reports and articles which are now appearing in profusion seldom, if ever, comment knowledgeably on the economic pressures which are frequently the reasons for people taking the enormous step of leaving their comparatively simple communities to come to a strange and sometimes hostile and suspicious one. I am reminded of this when I am shown letters from children in the depressed areas of the West Indies, who have been left perhaps with an ageing grandparent, or other relatives, but are financially dependent on their mothers here, when for some reason the mother has not been able to send the usual remittance, or extra money which is required for necessary items. The mothers would like to have the children join them here, but insufficient money, lack of suitable accommodation and the need to work very long hours often preclude them from doing so. The problem of working mothers is not, of course, confined to immigrants, but it can be an even more acute problem with immigrant mothers who are forced to work full time and have their children minded. Day nurseries are not always available for the times required, and private minding which is so often of poor standard, can result in emotion and development deprivation of the children. There are particular problems with coloured children. I think it would be true to say that during the five years I have been reviewing, there has been an easing of certain individual and personal problems as a result of adaptation and understanding, but, as I anticipated, there are more general problems arising, and these will continue to rise because adaptation does not yet mean acceptance. In Paddington most of our immigrants are English-speaking and of our own religion. West Indians particularly share many of our interests and cultural pursuits. This, of course, does mean that many problems they experience can be adequately dealt with by the existing services, especially as workers in the social field become more knowledgeable of the social history, origin and background of immigrants. Areas such as ours have now reached a stage when it is easier to consider the long-term problems arising from minority groups and migratory movements. I feel it is on these problems we should place emphasis. The question which comes sharply into focus is—how long are we to regard people from the Commonwealth as immigrants? We must remind ourselves that many have been earning their living in this country for a number of years and have borne children here who by definition, birth and rights are as English as I am. The only way in which the new generation are likely to differ from other Londoners, if they are coloured, is in that respect only. This is a situation which has arisen almost without conscious attention. By continuing to describe adapted citizens as immigrants, particularly if they are coloured people, we are tending to condition society into regarding them as people who are different, thereby perpetuating the difference. 41 In this country we are fortunate not to have passed the stage where we are able to plan a multi-racial community living in harmony, and this, of course, underlines the need to avoid making any minority group a target for discriminators. It is interesting to note that a situation is now arising where we begin to see the need for helping immigrants to understand their English children, and where we have to discourage indigenous people from regarding the children of immigrants as immigrant children. The last year did not bring any deterioration in actual immigrant-host relationships. Unfortunately, however, the inevitable frictions caused by the problems of housing shortage, shortages of certain welfare services, incompatibilities and clashes of behaviour patterns have attracted far more attention than usual and have been reported on very widely in the press. Much of this attention was, I suppose, to be expected during the election year. Unfortunately, however, some of the articles and reports are more enthusiastic than accurate or knowledgeable, and what is more disturbing is that even where the articles themselves have been constructive, the headlines and introductions on several occasions have been little short of inflammatory. The intensification of publicity and attention resulted in a noticeable hardening of attitude and apprehension all round. The increased interest has meant that I have been inundated with requests to help, advise, assist with and meet people from a variety of organisations, publishers, groups and the like who wish to learn about the problems (usually in little more than a couple of hours) in order to prepare a survey, thesis, article or booklet. While I am naturally happy to do all possible to further understanding, interest and concern in the task of integration, it will be understood that I have sometimes had to refuse this assistance, not only because of sheer pressure, but because I have sometimes felt that the resultant publications could do more harm than good. My task has been made easier by the unfailing encouragement I have always received from Dr. Oldershaw, to whom particularly on this occasion I would wish to express my gratitude. I am also indebted to the Staff of the Public Health Department and members of our Town Hall staff whose co-operation and help I have valued. I would also like to express my thanks to the officers of the London County Council with whom I have liaised, all of whom have been most helpful, and to the officers of the Citizens Advice Bureau who have shown a deep understanding of the problems with which we have been mutually concerned. 42 The Ministry of Health has requested that the following figures regarding factories and outworkers should be annexed to the Annual Report.
