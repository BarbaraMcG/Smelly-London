Two or three certificates were sent to me, but the disease was found to be other than Small Pox. Deaths from Small Pox during the last ten years— 1888 - 1893 6 1889 - 1894 2 1890 - 1895 4 1891 — 1896 1 1892 — 1897 — The annual rate per 1,000 living was 0.00. Scarlet Fever. The deaths from Scarlet Fever were 33, as against 29 last year. The total number of cases notified was 769 this year, and 666 last year. Deaths from Scarlet Fever during the last ten years— 1888 36 1893 51 1889 43 1894 19 1890 37 1895 16 1891 17 1896 29 1892 45 1897 33 The annual rate per 1000 living was .27. Of the 769 cases notified, 537 were removed to hospitals of the Asylum Board with 27 deaths: a mortality of 5.0 per cent. 232 were treated at home, with 6 deaths: a mortality of 2.5 per cent. The number of cases removed for treatment to the hospitals of the Asylums Board was 537 for this year, as against 362 last year. This increased number of removals which has been taking place steadily for years past does not appear to have had much effect in diminishing the total number of the cases occurring yearly. This is accounted for in our district by the cases treated at home, owing to the impossibility in our crowded parish of properly isolating them, being the means of spreading the disease broadcast so that almost all susceptible children are attacked. The removal b2 20 to hospital of so many of the cases is a vast blessing to this neighbourhood. I cannot see, however, that the full benefit of our hospitals will be obtained unless all the cases are removed. It is found in practice with the cases treated at home, that for the first few days a medical man is in attendance, after that his services are dispensed with on account of the expense. Before a month has gone by, the patient and nurse are heartily tired of the restrictions of isolation, and the Sanitary Authority is applied to to have the house disinfected. If the Officers of the Authority refuse after so short a time, the child, after a few days, is found mixing with the other children, or playing at the back of the house with its neighbours. Very often the child is found in the street. After some experience in this matter, I am obliged to say that, in my opinion, proper isolation at home in our houses is impossible. The same remarks are applicable to cases of Diphtheria. diphtheria. The deaths from this disease have slightly decreased in the year, the number being 65 this year, and 71 last year—The total number of cases notified was 331 this year, and 399 last year. Deaths from Diphtheria during the last ten years— 1888 8 1893 93 1889 55 1894 61 1890 32 1895 52 1891 44 1896 71 1892 38 1897 65 The annual rate per 1,000 living was .53. Of the 331 cases notified, 206 were removed to hospitals of the Asylums Board, with 35 deaths : a mortality of 16.9 per cent. 125 were treated at home and in General Hospitals,with 30 deaths, a mortality of 24.0 per cent. 21 typhoid fever. The number of cases notified during the year was 79, and the number last year 89. The deaths from Typhoid Fever were only 9 this year, and 18 last year. Even in this small number of deaths, one is justified in saying that the whole of them were not Enteric cases. In the cases removed to the Asylums Board Hospitals, it is a fact that 31 per cent. of them were found not to be suffering from that disease, and with greater force it may be permitted to be said that an equal error was present in those treated at home. For instance, some of the cases notified, after the lapse of a week or two, were certified to be quite well which could scarcely have been the case had the disease been of the true kind. In no case could the disease be in any way connected with the Maidstone Epidemic, and in only two cases could the disease be said to be due with almost certainty to oysters. Deaths from Typhoid Fever during the last ten years— 1888 12 1893 13 1889 22 1894 14 1890 18 1895 15 1891 12 1896 18 1892 10 1897 9 The annual rate per 1,000 living was .07. Of the 79 cases notified, 40 were removed to hospitals of the Asylums Board, with 2 deaths : a mortality 5 per cent. 39 were treated at home and in General Hospitals, with 7 deaths : a mortality of 17 .9 deaths. whooping cough. The deaths from this disease during the year were 82. The number last year was 66. Deaths from Whooping Cough during the last ten years— 1888 74 1893 109 1889 72 1894 75 1890 87 1895 72 1891 115 1896 66 1892 93 1897 82 The annual rate per 1,000 living was .67. 22 typhus fever. No death from this complaint occurred during the year, and no case was notified. measles. Year by year I have reported the large number of deaths from this disease. This year the number was 85, as compared with 98 last year. 1 have simply to record the opinion I expressed in my last report that Measles is a complaint which should be added to the list of Infectious Diseases compulsorily notified. Many excellent reasons could be given for such a course if adopted by the Vestry. I believe that such a notification would cause much greater care to be exhibited in the treatment of the complaint, and so tend to remove the charge of carelessness, due in most cases to ignorance, which has so often been made against parents in poor districts. It cannot be too widely known that Measles is very rarely fatal in the families of well to do people on account of the caro that is taken in the treatment. Deaths from Measles during the last ten years— 1888 29 1893 34 1889 114 1894 103 1890 103 1895 132 1891 31 1896 98 1892 182 1897 85 The annual rate per living was .69. 23 TABLE 10. deaths in the sanitary area from the principal zymotic diseases compared with london as a whole.

This matter can in no sense be said to be in abeyance, although up to the present time no house has been placed on the Register. In my opinion this provision in the Public Health Act, if not the most important, is of immense value to a parish like ours. During the past few years I have represented on many occasions a list of houses in my opinion suitable ones for being brought under the operation of the regulations, and the list has always been referred to the Sub-Committee dealing with this subject. Many meetings have been held and owners have over and over again been requested to furnish the particulars referred to in the regulations, and many of the owners have attended before the Sub-Committee to state their objections, yet still nothing definite in the way of registration has taken place. We know that at least 80 per cent. of the houses in this parish are let in lodgings, and it has been thought by those opposed to this registration that a large number of the better kind would possibly find a place on the Register, also that a midnight visit would be paid so frequently as to make life in such a house unbearable. It has further been asked why cannot we get everything that is needed under the Public Health Act, and so avoid the stigma upon a habitation of being called a lodging house. I may answer to these and many similar misconceptions that no reasonably intelligent person would ever think that the better class of houses would be selected for this work. Naturally, it would only be the debased property, always more or less out of repair, that would be registered. Then, as regards midnight visits, I do not think these would be made with that frequency as to spoil the tempers or health of our parishioners. The regulations simply give a better opportunity to the Local Authority to keep in repair property more or less insanitary by periodic cleansing and attention, which could only be effected after much difficulty if, in every case, a nuisance dangerous to health had to be proved. I believe that this alarm about houses being placed under the Regulations for 41 houses let in lodgings would entirely disappear if a reasonable quantity of houses were operated upon, and that within twelve months, as far as objections are concerned, the whole matter would have been forgotten. (Whilst this Report was passing through the press, two houses Nos. 41, Gurney Street, and 76, Elsted Street, have been placed by the Vestry upon the Register for Houses let in Lodgings). TABLE 16.

It is thus evident that the comparatively large amount of organic matter in the Thames-derived water recorded in 1894 was not repeated in the last three years; indeed, the proportion was, in the last two years, lower than in any year since 1890. The maximum organic matter in the Lea was also the smallest observed since 1890, except that found in 1896, which was slightly lower. 42 TABLE 17. METEOROLOGICAL, TABLE FOR LONDON, 1897.
