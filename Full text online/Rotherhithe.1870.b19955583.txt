During the past year one additional gas lamp has been provided and fixed in Wellington Street, Albion Street, and one lamp discontinued in Adam Street, making the total number of lamps lighted by the Surrey Consumers' Gas Company 370. (For particulars of Contract, see page 8). The Contract with the Surrey Consumers Gas Company having expired on the 29th September, 1870, the Vestry applied to the Company, with the view of obtaining a reduction in the price paid per lamp, viz., £4 10s. ; and the Directors have since agreed to enter into a contract with the Vestry to light the parish lamps with gas for seven years from 1st July, 1871, at the reduced price of £4 5s. per lamp per annum. Cleansing, Watering, &c. A Contract has been entered into with Mr. Alfred Thomas Hobman for the supply of Men, Horses, and Carts, at per day for man, horse and cart, for the cartage of the sweepings from the whole of the roads and streets (after the same have been swept up by the labourers employed by the Vestry), to a shoot provided by the Vestry. 16 Mr. Hobman also contracts for the supply of horses, harness, and drivers for the Vestry's water carts.

(For particulars of Contract see page 8). Removal of Nuisances, Sanitary Measures, &c. During the past year 192 Notices have been served in duplicate under the "Nuisances Removal Act," upon complaints made by the Medical Officer of Health and Inspector of Nuisances, 175 of which nuisances have been abated by removal of the cause of complaint, 13 by the provision of proper drainage from the houses into covered sewers, and in 4 cases the houses have been closed as unfit for habitation. Disinfecting Apparatus. The Vestry having received a letter from the Medical Officer of the Privy Council urging (amongst other measures to be adopted to prevent the spread of Small-pox) the provision of a place, and the necessary apparatus and attendance for disinfecting infected articles and things, the Vestry, after careful consideration of the subject, accepted a Tender from Messrs. Fraser Bros. for the erection of their Patent Disinfecting Chamber and Apparatus in the stone yard at the rear of the Workhouse of this parish, for the sum of £126, which apparatus has been erected and in use since March last. The parishioners have the use of the before-mentioned apparatus for the disinfection of their clothing, bedding, &c., free of charge, upon application at the Vestry Offices, 61, Paradise Street, or to the Medical Officer of Health and Inspector of Nuisances. The Medical Officer of Health, by direction of the Vestry, drew up a few practical directions to meet or prevent, as far as possible, the spread of Small-pox, Fever, &c., which directions were printed and circulated throughout the parish. Nine notices to make drains from dwelling-houses to covered sewers have been served by order of the Vestry; in four instances the notices have been complied with by the execution of proper drainage, and the remainder are standing over, the houses having become unoccupied. Slaughter House Licenses. Fourteen notices were in September last received from Butchers and others of their 17 intention to apply to the Special Sessions for licenses for their slaughter-houses, and they having been severally inspected by the Medical Officer of Health, were all duly licensed by the magistrates in October, 1870. Cow Houses. The six Cow-houses heretofore licensed in this parish were re-licensed by the magistrates in October last, they having also been previously inspected by the Medical Officer of Health. For further particulars as to sanitary matters, see the Medical Officer of Health's Annual Report hereto annexed (Appendix No. 1). Financial. £1,000 has been paid off the Paving Loan borrowed of Mr. J. W. Barrett, leaving £1,000 to be repaid by yearly instalments of £200 each, with interest at £5 per cent. per annum. £1,419 6s. has been paid off the Loan borrowed of Mr. Robert Lawrence for paving the carriageways, Union Road and Deptford Lower Road, leaving £8,042 14s. to be repaid by equal annual instalments within a period of eighteen years, with interest at £5 per cent. per annum.

The Vestry set aside £280 yearly to form a sinking fund to pay the same off at the expiration of the said terms. Charity Estates, &c. The accounts of Messrs. Robert Allen and Henry Ives, the Churchwardens for the years 1870-71 have been audited, and the following is a copy of the Charities Account:— £ s. d.

Fire Escapes. Shortly after the disastrous fire and loss of life which occurred on the 23rd August, 1870. at No. 6, Church Street, the Vestry caused a letter to be addressed to the Metropolitan Board of Works, calling the attention of that Board to the inutility of the system 19 of allowing the Fire Escape conductors to sleep in an enclosed box while on duty, and urging the Board to direct that the conductors patrol in the neighbourhood of the Fire Escape Station all night, in order that they might be enabled to hear an alarm of fire and attend with the Escape with the least possible delay. The Vestry also suggested to the Board that a key to the fire-plugs be provided at each Fire Engine Station to enable the firemen to turn on the water, as soon as they reach the locality of a fire with the engine, in lieu of their having to wait the arrival of a turncock for that purpose, to which communication the Vestry received the following reply from the Metropolitan Board of Works:— "METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS. "Spring Gardens, S.W. "5th October, 1870. "Dear Sirs, The Board have had under consideration the letter from the Vestry of Rotherhithe of the 16th ult., on the subject of the recent fire in Church Street. The Vestry complain that the Fire Escape man stationed in the Deptford Lower Road did not attend with his escape until a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after the fire broke out. Enquiry has been made into the circumstances, and it has been ascertained that in less than one minte after receiving intimation of the fire, the man had the Fire Escape in motion, and in four minutes he arrived at the scene of the fire. He then, however, found the fire coming out of all the windows, and was consequently prevented from getting into the house. The Fire Engine also proceeded to the fire with all possible dispatch, arriving there in six minutes after the call was received at the station. It thus appears that no time was lost, either by the man in charge of the Escape, or by the men at the station. I am to add, in corroboration of this, that the facts were fully enquired into at both inquests which were held in connection with the fire, and that in each case the Coroner and Jury expressed their opinion that both the Escape and Engine attended with the utmost promptitude. "With reference to the suggestion of the Vestry, that the men in charge of the Escapes should patrol for a certain distance in the neighbourhood of the stations all night, instead of sleeping in their boxes, I am to state that this point has received careful consideration; and having regard to the necessarily limited force composing the Brigade, the result of the Board's experience is, that the present system is the best. Amongst other reasons against the alteration suggested, it appears to the Board improbable that a man who had been walking about all night would be physically able to undergo the amount of exertion sometimes necessary on the part of the Escape men. Further, it requires but a very short time, less than a minute after receiving a call, for the man to leave his box and to have his machine in motion, so that little time would be saved by the alteration suggested. "With regard to the other suggestion of the Vestry, viz., that there should be kept at each Fire Engine Station a key to the fire-plugs, to enable the firemen to turn on the water as soon as they arrived at a fire, without having to wait for a turncock, I am to state that a complete set of turncock's tools is always carried with each engine. The difficulty generally experienced is, that, notwithstanding that they have the necessary tools, it is impossible for the firemen to tell which pipes are charged with water. In the present instance, however, the delay was caused by a stone having got into the box of the fire-plug. 20 "I have to request that you will be good enough to lay this letter before the Vestry at their next meeting. "I am, dear Sir, yours faithfully, (Signed), "JOHN POLLARD, Clerk. "Messrs. Hawks & Stokes, "Clerks to the Vestry of Rotherhithe." The Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869.

APPENDIX No. 1. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, From 1st April, 1870, to 31st March, 1871; The Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, Surrey. Gentlemen, The annual statement I have to present to you on this occasion, is more favourable than that which referred to 1869 and 1870; inasmuch as it will be found on examining it, that the births have increased, and the deaths diminished; and although the changes alluded to are not very large, they indicate a sound sanitary condition of the parish. The occurrence of epidemic diseases is of considerable interest, and concern to those who are engaged in the performance of sanitary duties, and as diseases of this class always contribute largely to the aggregate mortality in a district; and are supposed to be more influenced by bad air, defective drainage, and insufficient food and clothing, than some others, it is proper, when any of these diseases become unusually prevalent, to bring the subject prominently under your notice. Last year Scarlatina was the epidemic scourge, and its destructive effects on life and future health were unusually severe. This disease had scarcely subsided, when Small-pox, which had been warning us of its approach, became active, and in some districts fatal in its effects to an unusual degree. 21 In the early part of this year active measures were taken to meet this outbreak of Small-pox. Circulars were issued, recommending Vaccination and Re-vaccination to be performed; the Vestry resolved, that an apparatus to disinfect by heat, the Bedding, Clothing, &c., of infected persons should be provided; and determined that Messrs. Fraser, of Commercial Road East, should construct one for the use of the inhabitants; they also appointed a Stoker to attend to the furnace of the disinfecting chamber, and two more persons to disinfect rooms and collect articles supposed to be infected, and take them home after they had been disinfected. Papers were also circulated, containing directions for the management of the sick room of afflicted patients and rules for disinfecting the rooms of infected persons during their illness and after their recovery. A suggestion was made to the Vestry, to make temporary accommodation for the reception of patients afflicted with Small-pox, who did not require Poor Law relief, but it was not considered expedient to entertain the subject, at that time. Although Small-pox had become active, and Scarlatina had not ceased its ravages, it will be observed by referring to the table below, that deaths from epidemic diseases have not this year exceeded the average number. Disease. 1866 1867 1868 1869 1870 1871 Deaths. Total.

Nine deaths were caused by Fever, which is below the average number. Scarlatina destroyed the lives of twenty-one persons; in the first quarter, eight; second quarter, one; third quarter, ten; and fourth quarter, two. Small-pox. Twenty-three deaths were registered, and we may subtract three cases which were sent from other parishes to the temporary Hospital and died therein; so that twenty deaths are the number, actually due to the parishioners. There was no change in the average rate of mortality from Small-pox, until the last quarter, when nineteen deaths were registered. As far as could be ascertained, sixteen of these patients had not been Vaccinated, six had been Vaccinated, and one was not susceptible of its power. Medical men who have had much experience in the performance of Vaccination, and the treatment of Small-pox, are well agreed as to the protective power of Vaccination, and the necessity for re-Vaccination; my convictions have been strengthened by two facts, which I will narrate. About ten years ago I attended a poor woman in her confinement late at night; on the following morning when I visited her, the babe was lying beside her, and a 22 child about two years old suffering from Small-pox on the other side; as she refused to permit the diseased child to be removed, I vaccinated the babe at once, and it took effect completely; a few days ago I saw the Father of the babe, who lives in Bermondsey, and he informed me that it never had had Small-pox, although it had recently been in the midst of it; this case proves the protective power of Vaccination, and that there is no limit to the time when the operation may be performed. The efficacy of Re-vaccination has been in some degree tested, by the opportunity afforded me of watching its effects upon the police force under my care; I have vaccinated them on three separate occasions, and at intervals of some years, and I do not remember that any of them suffered from Small-pox afterwards; during the present epidemic there has been no case of Small-pox in the division under my management. Measles were fatal in nine cases. Whooping-cough has considerably abated, fifteen deaths having been registered Diarrhoea caused the death of twenty-two children, all under two years of age. Diptheria. Two deaths were occasioned by this disease. One hundred and eighty two deaths were due to diseases of the air passages and organs of respiration; diseases of the Larynx caused two deaths, Croup four, Bronchitis sixty-three, Pneumonia twenty-two, and Phthisis ninety-one; Bronchitis is chiefly destructive to the young and those past the middle period of life, Pneumonia to the young, and the victims of Phthisis, are more numerous about the middle period of life. Diseases of the nervous system, inflammatory complaints besides those already enumerated, the diseases of children, and other causes of death, represent the number of deaths from all causes, during the year, at six hundred and fifteen, three hundred and six males, and three hundred and nine females, being sixty-four less than in the former year. Deaths. From April 1, to June 30, 1870 125 „ July 1, to September 30, 1870 152 „ October 1, to December 31, 1870 174 „ January 1, to March 31, 1871 164 615 Some deductions must be made from the above statement, inasmuch as forty-seven Coroner's Inquests have been held, the majority having been on bodies found in the Thames, and brought ashore at Rotherhithe; many of these could not be identified as inhabitants of the Parish, and must consequently be struck off the list of deaths, to the amount of twenty; three deaths also occurred from small-pox in the temporary hospital belonging to the Union, which had been sent from other parishes, and as fifty-five cases of registered deaths occurred in the Union Infirmary, and I have ascertained that twenty-five of the patients were sent from other parishes, viz., twenty-one from Bermondsey, one from St. Olave's, and four from St. John's parish, we shall find the actual number of deaths to amount to five hundred and sixty-seven, and the rate of mortality, estimating the population at twenty-eight thousand, as 20.25, per thousand. The list of deaths includes that of a male aged 101. 24 TABLE OF THE MORTALITY IN ROTHERHITHE. First Quarter, from April 1st, 1870, to June 30th, 1870. Diseases.
