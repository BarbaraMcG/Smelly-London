SNOW STORMS. In consequence of the heavy fall of snow which took place on Sunday and Monday, the 10th and llth February, 1889, extra men were engaged for the purpose of clearing the footways and channels, forming crossings, and clearing the principal thoroughfares. The snow was removed by the Contractors of the Board, who employed a large number of horses, carts, and men for the purpose, the quantity of snow carted being 1,442 loads, equal to 2,884 cubic yards. The cost incurred by the Board for extra labour was £22 1s. 1d., in addition to which one day's pay each was paid to the men in the employ of the Board who were engaged during the night of the 13th February. FLOODING AFTER STORMS. With a view to the prevention of flooding consequent upon heavy falls of rain, the Metropolitan Board of Works have connected the Local Sewer in Turner's Road, Limehouse with the Low Level Sewer. GENERAL WORKS. The Postal Telegraph Authorities have laid telegraph wire pipes as follows, via.:— From the London Dock Wall to the Sewer Ventilating Shaft by Hermitage Bridge, Wapping; from the existing pipe on the west side of West India Dock Road to the new Police Station; from the corner of Colling wood Street, Broad Street, Ratcliff to the office of the Free Trade Wharf Company on the north aide of Broad Street ; on the south side of East India Dock Road between the rear of Messrs. Coubro and Scrutton's premises and the existing pipe opposite; and on the west side of West India Dock Road between Messrs. Kirkaldy's premises and the existing pipe opposite. In each case the paving was made good by the Contractors of the Board, and the expense of re instatement paid by the Post Office. The Dry Docks Corporation of London have repaved the swing bridge at the entrance of Bridge Dry Dock, Narrow Street. Messrs. Drew and Son, with the sanction of the Board, have erected a footbridge across Hunt's Mews, Shadwell, to connect their premises on either side of the Street. The Proprietors of Atlantic Wharf, Bow Common, applied for the permission of the Board to lay a 6-in. pipe under the footway of a small part of Risbie's Rope Walk, Limehouse, for the conveyance of oil from Atlantic Wharf to the Regent's Canal Dock. The Board granted the application, subject to certain term, embodied in an Agreement entered into between the applicants and the Board and the payment by them to the Board of a rental of 5/- per annum. The London and St. Katharine's Docks Company have relaid the carriageway paving of the New Gravel Lane Bridge over the Shadwell Entrance of the London Docks.

The arches in Rose Lane have been lime-whited. The East London Water Works Company have fixed hydrants in various parts of the District for the Metropolitan Board of Works. MAINTENANCE OF MAIN ROADS. The Board having had its attention drawn to the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1888, as to the maintenance of Dieturnpiked and Main Roads, I prepared a Report as to the roads in the District which 1 considered should be submitted to the London County Council as coming under the definition of Main Roads, and I suggested that all roads which might be decided by the Council to be Main Roads should be repaired and maintained by the District Board, the County Council contributing towards the expense thereof. As certain of the roads specified in my Report were paitly in adjoining Parishes, I also suggested that if joint action were taken by all the District Boards and Vestries in the East of Loudon and a mutual understanding arlived at, the matter would go before the Cunty Council with a great deal more force and importance than it each Dstrict made an isolated application. The Board accordingly, having approved the Report, resolved to invite the Poplar and Whitechapel District Boards and the Vestries of Mile End Old Town, Bethnal Green, and St. George-in the-East to appoint Delegates to confer with representatives of this Board upon the subject, and such conference will take place in due course. LONDON HYDRAULIC POWER COMPANY. Notice was given dated 1st March, 1889, by the Engineers and General Managers of the London Hydraulic Power Company, of the intention of that Company to lay mains in those portions of Upper East Smithfield, and Dock Street, within the Limehouse District as shewn in the tracing accompanying the Notice. The Company have statutory powers under the London Hydraulic Power Acts, 1871, and 1884, to lay mains for applying motive power by hydraulic pressure, to cranes used for the purpose of raining and lowering goods, and for working Dock Gaten, and other machinery, and also power to break up streets and lay down pipes for the purposes of the arts, the Company repaying any expense incurred by local authorities in relaying the paving &c, and in supervising the Company's works. TRAMWAYS. The North Metropolitan Tramways Company are reconstructing their line in Burdett road, and relaying the paving abutting thereon. In July, 1888, the Directors of the Tramway Company, in consequence of a representation made by thin Board, consented that in future the fares on the Cans running between the West India Dock and Victoria Park, should the name on Sundays and Bank Holidays as on week days, a concession which has since been extended over the whole of the North Metropolitan Tramway Company's system. DR. BARNARDO'S HOMES, STEPNEY CAUSEWAY. The carriageway of Stepney Causeway, from the part previously widened to the Coinmercial Road, has been widened to facilitate the traffic in that thoroughfare, and the same has been paved with asphalte by the Val de Travers Asphalte Paving Company, the cost of the works being borne by Dr. Barnardo. Dr. Barnardo has by consent of the Board, placed two ornamental lamps and columns, at the end of Stepney Causeway, in Commercial Road, with notices indicating the situation of the Homes. The cost of lighting the lamp on the west side is paid by Dr. Barnardo, ami of the other (fixed in lieu of the public lamp and column formerly there), by the Board. Tablets have been placed in Stepney Causeway, under the name of the street to indicate the position of the Homes. The tablets were fixed by Dr. Barnardo at his expense in accordance with conditions specified by the Board. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. A Notice was received dated 29th .Tune, 1888, from Messrs. Deacon & Co.. Solicitors for the London Electric Supply Corporation, Limited, of the Company's intenti0n to apply to the Board of Trade for a provisional order, to be continued in the ensuing session0 of Parliament, whereby it was proposed to authorise the Company to supply Electricity for any public or private purposes in the various Parishes and Districts in the Metropolis and that the proposed area of supply would include the whole of the Limehouse District. A similar Notice was also receiver dated 29th June, 1888, from Mr. E. R. Creed, Secretary of the South Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, Limited, of the Company's intention to apply to the Board of Trade, in the ensuing session, for a provisional order for power to supply Electricity for lighting and other purposes in certain streets and places within the Limehouse District. Both of such Notices were subsequently abandoned. IMPROVEMENTS. The Footway in the Commercial Road, opposite the Town Hall, Limehouse, has been reduced in width, so as to facilitate the carriage traffic. The Footway on the west side of Upper Well Alley, ha* been reduced in width to 1 ft. 6 inn., so that two vehicles can pass. The purchase from the Receiver of Police of the piece of ground at the corner of Amoy Place and Birchfield street, required for the setting back the building line at the north end of the latter thoroughfare, and referred to in my last Report, has been completed and the land has been thrown into the public way and paved by tinBoard's Contractors. The London Laborers' Dwellings Society, having purchased a number of houses on the east side of Now Gravel Lane, from the Bull public house to Wapping Wall and pulled them down and cleared the ground for the purpose of erecting Artisans' Dwellings, an opportunity occurred to complete the widening of Wapping "Wall, the centre portion of which was widened by the Board in 1871, a moiety of the cost of the improvement being contributed by the Metropolitan Board of Works. As authorised by the Board 1 accordingly entered into communication with the Secretary of the Society, with a view to the acquisition of the land required, being the site of Nos. 1 and 2, Wapping Wall, and the Society agreed to accept the sum of £250 for the same. The Metropolitan Board acceded to an application for a contribution of one half the cost, and the purchase having been completed, the land was thrown into the public way, increasing the width of the thoroughfare from 23-ft 6-in., to 34 ft. at the west end. Mr. King the owner of Gun Dock and Wharf, High Street, Wapping, being about to erect new warehouses upon the site, informed the Board that he was willing to sell to the Board for the purpose of widening the street, a piece of land the area of which was about 800 superficial feet, ami which would be vacant when the new warehouses were completed, for the sum of £ 1,000. The Board authorised me to communicate with Mr. King with a view to his accepting a smaller sum for the land in question, and ultimately after long negociation he agreed to accept £300 for the same. The Metropolitan Board of Works upon application consented to contribute one moiety of the amount, and the purchase will be completed in due course. I am, Gentlkmen, Your most obedient Servant, CHARLES DUNCU, Surrryor of the Board. BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the year 1888. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS for tiie LIMEHOUSE DISTEICT Gentlemen, 1 have the honour to submit my Report on the Health and Sanitary condition of the Limehouse District for the year 1888. During that year there were registered in the District 420 Marriages, a number which corresponds exactly with that registered in the previous year, but which falls short of the average of the ten years 1878.87 by 43. The Marriage rate in the District was again 14 persons per 1,000 population, while in London it was 16.1 per 1,000, the lowest Marriage rate yet recorded in Loudon. The Births registered in the District numbered 2,084, and were 90 below the average of the last ten years. They corresponded to an annual birth rate of 35.5 per 1,000, that of London having been 30.7 per 1,000 population. 2 The registered Deaths, exclusive of those of non-residents which occurred in Public Institutions situated in the District, but inclusive of those of residents which occurred in Public Institutions beyond the limits of the District numbered 1441 and corresponded to a death rate of 24.6 per 1,000 population, that of Loudon having been 18.5 per 1,000, by far the lowest rate yet recorded. The Deaths of Childeren under 5 yearn numbered 712, of which 431 were those of children under one year. The number of deaths in Public Institutions within and without the District of persona ordinarily resident therein wan 315. The deaths from Diseases of a Zymotic character numbered, 264 and included 88 from Measels 23 from Scarlatina, 58 from Whooping Cough, 23 from Diphtheria, 9 from Knteric Fever, and 10 from Diarrhoea. Compared with the annual average of the last ten years the deaths from Measles were nearly double, those from Scarlet Fever under half, those from Diphtheria more than double, those from Whooping Cough about equal, those from Enteric Fever slightly below, while those from Diarrhoea were considerably below. The total number of deaths from these causes during the year were 241, and the annual average of the last ten years was 255 5. The Deaths from Constitutional Diseases numbered 205, and included 2'j from Cancer, 34 from Tabes Mesenterica, 15 from tubercular Meningitis, and 102 from Phthisis. The deaths from Cancer continue to shew a steady increase. Developmental Diseases caused 116 deaths, of which 25 were due to Premature Birth and 86 to old age. Local Diseases caused 709 deaths, and included 154 from affections of the Nervous System, 79 from diseases of the Circulatory System, 3G2 from affections of the Respiratory System, 67 from (diseases of the Digestive System, and 33 from diseases of tho Urinary System. The Deaths due to VIOLENCE numbered 77, of which 72 were due to Accident or Negligence. Forty seven deaths were registered as due to Debility. Infectious Sickness. Qne case of Typhus and one of Smallpox occurred during the year. The patients were removed to Hospital, the usual precautions Liken, and no further cases occurred. Measles was again prevalent in the District, no fewer than 94 cases having come to my knowledge, of which 88 were reported as deaths. Sixty one cases of Scarlatina came under my observation of which 23 were reported as deaths; of these 15 died in Limehouse, 4 in Ratcliff, and 4 in the Homerton Fever Hospital. Thirty two cases of Diphtheria were reported to me of which 23 were deaths. Twelve deaths occurred in Shad well in which Parish is situated the East London Childrens' Hospital, 9 in Limehouse, and 2 in Institutions outside the District. Twenty nine cases of Enteric Fever came to my knowledge, and of these 9 were reported as deaths ; 1 occurred in Shadwell, 1 in Ratclitr. 4 in Limehouse, and 3 in Institutions outside the District. 4 Sanitary Work. For the details of routine Sanitary inspections I beg to r« for you to Table VI. The premises of Messrs. Wickens, Pease & Co., Bone boilers, of Broad Bridge, Shadwell, came under my notice several times. The nuisance from this place is intermitting ; at one time it arisen from the bones collected for boiling, at another from the contents of the bone hole, and at another from the general dirtiness of the premises. Nothing but systematic and frequent visitation prevents these premises from becoming an intolerable nuisance to the neigh bourhood. The Limehouse Cut was frequently under observation, and examinations of the water in the Cut were made, but re\ealed nothing of importance. I am confident that the complaints made of smell from the Cut, take their origin in the majority of cases from the offensive nature of the cargoes of many of the barges. Measles prevailed in the Autumn to such an extent in the neighbourhood of the Gill Street and Northey Street Board Schools that I suggested to the Managers the advisability of closing them. My advice having been acted upon the epidemic declined and the Schools were opened again in about a month. From the Linde British Refrigeration Company I received grievous complaints of nuisance arising from the man hole and sewer grating in front of their premises in Lower Shadwell. Various representations were made regarding it to the Metropolitan Board of Works, but the steps taken were only palliative and from time to time the complaints were renewed. The nuisance arising from the sewer gratings in the District is very serious and 5 those in Wapping have been on several occasions the subject of complaint. The cowsheds, slaughter houses and bakehouses were duly in spected; a list of these premises it to be found in the appendix. Sale of Food and Drugs' Act. One hundred samples of food, etc. were examined at the laboratory during the year, viz; 24 of Milk of which 5 were adulterateb with water in proportions varying from C to 21 per cent. Twelve of Mustard, of which one sample contained 33 per cent. of Starch coloured with Turmeric. Six of Pepper, of which one sample was adulterated with 20 per cent of Pea flour. Three of Whiskey, of which one sample was 0.6. degrees U.P. below the standard prescribed by the Act Four of Vinegar, of which two were poor in Acetic Acid. Ten of Coffee, of which two were adulterated with 75 per cent. of Chicory. The remainder consisting of Bread, Butter, Gin, Cocoa and Quinine were unadulterated. Again I have to acknowledge the great assistance I have received from the lnspectors in the carrying on of the Sanitary Work of the District The duties devolving upon them have been performed with tact, intelligence and assiduity. 1 have the honour to remain.
