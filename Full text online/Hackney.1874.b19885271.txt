Sanitary Offices, Town Hall, Hackney, May, 1875. REPORT ON THE SANITARY STATE OF THE HACKNEY DISTRIC FOR THE YEAR, 1874. To the Board of Works for the Hackney District. Gentlemen, I regret to say that the public health of the district has not been quite so good this year as in 1872 and 1873, but still the death rate is not so high as for all London. The increased mortality for Hackney was caused ehiefty by the slight outbreak of Scarlet Fever, and especially by the extremely cold weather which occurred at the latter end of the year, but as I shall refer to this in another part of my report, I shall pass on without further comment to discuss Table I. 4 TABLE I.—Hackney District.

This table shows the population from 1865 to the middle of 1874, calculated on the census returns for 18C1 and 1871. It will be seen that the increase is nearly 40,000 persons, but is not quite at the rate which took place in the years 1861-71. The increase since 1871, has been calculated at a lower rate than for the ten years 1861-71, because the number of houses assessed to the poor-rate have not progressed in the same ratio as in the previous ten years. The rate however, may have been maintained by a larger number of persons occupying the houses, in which case the calculated population is too small in number. 5 acres of water, and 467 acres of open spaces of land, which include the Marshes consisting of 345 acres. It will also he noticed that although the number of deaths is the largest, with one exception, during the ten years, the births have steadily increased up to the present large number of 4755 in the year. The proportion of births to deaths was very high, although the mortality was in excess of the average, as 170 births were registered to each 100 deaths. The proportion of births in 1874 to each 100 in 1865 is as large as 141, whilst the deaths have not maintained the same rate, as there were only 132 deaths in 1874, to each 100 in 1865. The marriages which have been celebrated each year in the district have not varied so much as the births or deaths, still the table shows that they are on the increase.

As regards Stamford Hill subdistrict the ratio has become less, viz.:4.6 against 4.9 in 1871, whilst in West Hackney there are now registered 1118 births against 971 in 1871, or 23.5 against 23.4 per cent, of the whole. Although the number of births registered in Hackney and South Hackney are much larger than in 1871, 1804 births having been 6 registered in Hackney against 1583, and 1166 in South Ilackney against 1074 in 1871, yet the ratio is smaller, viz.: 37.9 against 38.2, and 24.5 against 25.9 per cent, of the total. The figures undoubtedly indicate that the population of Stoke Newington is increasing in a much greater proportion than in the other sub-districts, and that West Hackney has participated in it to a less extent. TABLE III. 1874.—Deaths in each Sub-District. Quarters. Stoke Newington Stamford Hill. West Hackney. Hackney. South Hackney. Totals. First 46 29 154 371 168 768 Second 55 39 123 265 139 622 Third 39 24 149 296 144 652 Fourth 50 44 153 343 168 748 Totals 190 136 579 1275 619 2799 The deaths in Stoke Newington have not kept pace with the births, as there were only 190 deaths registered in 1874 against 165 in 1871, or at the rate of 142 births to each 100 in 1871, and only 115 deaths to each 100 in 1871. It is true that the mortality of 1871 was unusually high, but this will not account for the difference, and we must therefore conclude that the population has become changed in its character by the immigration of a uumber of married persons in the prime of life and the consequent diminution in the proportion of unmarried and elderly people. The deaths in Stamford Hill sub-district are considerably in excess, as there were 136 deaths registered in 1874 against only 100 in 1871, but this difference has been caused to a great extent by the very large number of aged persons who died during the cold weather. In West Hackney and Hackney the deaths were absolutely less than in 1871, as 579 deaths only were registered in West Hackney against 631 in 1871, and 1275 in Hackney against 1313 in 1871, whilst in South Hackney the number remains almost unchanged, as there were 7 619 this year against 605 in 1871. These figures, taken with those of the births, indicate that the population in Haekney and South Hackney has not increased to any considerable extent since 1871. One of the best criteria for judging as to the healthiness of a district, is to be obtained by a comparison of the number of deaths of children under 1 year with the total births. It is true that as a few births most probably still escape registration, the calculated proportion of deaths is a little too high, but as the objection applies to all districts, it does not require much consideration. In the annual summary of the Registrar-General for 1874, the rate is given for 18 large towns, including London, 17.4 per cent. In London the average is not so large, being 15.5 percent.; in Portsmouth it is 15.1 percent.; in Bristol 15.3 per cent.; whilst in Nottingham it is 19.5, in Manchester 19.7, in Newcastle-on-Tyne 19.8, in Leeds 20.0, in Leicester 21.5, and in Liverpool as high as 23.3 per cent. The rate for all London was lower than it has been for many years past. Whilst the mortality of children under 1 year old, for all London was 15.5 per cent, of the total births, the ratio for the different districts varied considerably, as in the northern district, (which includes Hackney), it was 15.1 per cent., in the southern it was 14.5, in the east 16.0, in the west 16.9, and in the central 17.4, showing that in the northern and southern districts, which contain a considerable proportion of open country, the mortality was lowest. The same obtains for Hackney, as whilst the rate for the whole district was 13.8 per cent., it was only 11.3 for Stoke Newington, 11.9 for Stamford Hill, 13.3. for West Hacknep, 14.3 for Hackney, and as much as 14.6 for South Hackney. But although the proportion of deaths was larger in Hackney and South Hackney as compared with that for Stoke Newington and Stamford Hill, yet it was much below that for all London, and was also only 0.1 per cent, above the rate for the southern 8 district of London, which had the smallest mortality of any of these divisions. This is very satisfactory when we consider how poor and crowded are some of the streets in Hackney and South Hackney. Indeed if a high death-rate of children under 1 year old, as compared with the births, existed in any of these Subdistricts, I should feel much dissatisfied at such a result of the active sanitary work which has been so long carried out in this district.

"Developmental Diseases" caused a mortality of 385 persons, or at the rate of 13.8 per cent, of the whole,— premature births, atrophy and debility, old age, malformations, &c. belong to this class. Under "Violent Deaths" were registered 94 deaths or 3.4 per cent, which is precisely the average for 10 years. The ages at death show slight variations from the mean of the 23 years ending 1873, as there were 666 deaths under 1 year or 238 per 1000, the average being 216; 187 or 67 per 1000 between 1 and 2 years old, and 239 or 85 per 1000 between 2 and 5 years old, making a total of 426 or 152 per 1000 between 1 and 5 years, the average being 160, so that the diminution between 1 and 5 almost counterbalances the excess under 1 year. There were 151 or 54 per 1000 deaths of persons between 5 and 15; 135 or 48 per 1000 between 15 and 25; 172 or 61 per 1000 between 25 and 35; 220 or 79 per 1000 between 35 and 45 ; 209 or 75 per 1000 between 45 and 55; 234 or 83 per 1000 between 55 and 65; 301 or 109 per 1000 between 65 and 75, and no less than 285 deaths or 102 per 1000 of inhabitants who were 75 years old, or of a greater age. This proportion of deaths above 75 was as nearly as possible the mean for the 23 years, but was a good deal in excess of that for any year since 1868. There were 149 deaths of persons registered as being 80 years and above. Of these, 22 were 80 years old; 10 were 81; 16 were 82; 15 were 83; 24 were 84; 7 were 85; 11 were 86; 9 were 87; 7 were 88; 6 were 89; 7 were 90; 4 were 91; 2 were 92; 1 was 93; 3 were 94; 2 were 95; 1 was 96; 1 was 100; and 1 of the extraordinary age of 102 years and 3 months old,— he was born on the lltli of September, 1772, and died on December 24th, 1874. 10 TABLE V. Showing Mortality from certain classes of Diseases, the proportions to population and to total deaths.—1874. Total Deaths. Deaths per 1000 of Population. Percentage of Deaths to Total Deaths. 1. Zymotic Diseases 459 3.3 16.4 2. Tubercular 427 3.1 15.2 3. Pulmonary, other than Phthisis 502 3.6 17.9 4. Convulsive Diseases of Infants under 1 year 124 0.9 4.4 5. Wasting Diseases of Infants 173 1.3 6.2 2. Includes Phthisis, Scrofula, Rickets, Tabes Mesenterica, and deaths from Hydrocephalus in children more than a year. 4. Includes Infantile Hydrocephalus, Meningitis, Convulsions and Teething. 5. Includes Marasmus, Atrophy and Debility, Want of Breast Milk, and Premature Birth. This table is one of some importance as it shows the number of deaths from Zymotic diseases; Tubercular affections; Pulmonary diseases, except Phthisis, which is placed with Tubercular affections; Convulsive and Wasting diseases of infants. Most of these diseases, except the Zymotic class, take their origin either from family predisposition, the want of proper food and care, exposure to cold or vicissitudes of weather, overcrowding, or some of the other evils which are almost inseparable from poverty and to a certain extent from vice. The number of deaths from Zymotic diseases was unusually small in spite of the Scarlet Fever epidemic, as only 164 out of each 1000 deaths were registered from these causes. This is the smallest percentage which has been registered in Hackney since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act, the next smallest having been in 1867 and 1868 when only 168 per 1000 were registered. It is also especially worthy of remark, as all the deaths of inhabitants from Scarlet Fever in the Homerton Hospitals are included this year in the returns, but were not previously to 1871, so that the average for the 18 years, which is 210, would have 11 been somewhat larger if all the deaths had been included. The rate of death from this class of disease in proportion to the population, viz.: 33 per 10,000 persons, was smaller than for all London. The deaths from Tubercular affections, amounting to 427 or 152 per 1000 deaths, were about the ordinary number, or perhaps rather less than usual; the death rate to 10,000 population was 36. The number of deaths from Pulmonary affections was larger than for any other group of diseases under consideration as 502 deaths or 179 per 1000 deaths, or 36 per 10,000 population, were registered. This is larger than the average for the district, which is 100 per 1000 deaths. Convulsive diseases of infants, that is to say, infantile wateron-the-brain, meningitis, convulsions and teething, caused 124 deaths, or in the proportion of 44 per 1000 deaths; whilst Wasting diseases of children, which include marasmus, atrophy and debility, want of breast milk and premature birth, caused a mortality of 173 or 62 per 1000 deaths. The next table is one of considerable importance, as it shows not only the number of deaths in each year since 1864 from small pox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough, fever and diarrhoea in Hackney, but also the totals from these seven epidemic diseases in London. It also shows the annual average number of deaths, the percentage of deaths to total deaths, and the mean annual number of deaths per 10,000 population for the 10 years 1864-73. 12 1864 1865 1866 1867 1868 1869 1870 1871 1872 1873 TABLE VI. 1864-74.—Deaths from the principal Infectious Diseases and dlarrhcea. 52 weeks in each year.

Measles also had a small number of deaths in one year, viz. 15, against as many as 68 in 1874; the average annual number being 39. The mean annual death-rate from Scarlet Fever is 92, so that the mortality for 1874, which was only 97, was scarcely as high as the mean, but was in excess of the number of deaths which occurred in 186S, the year of the commencement of the great outbreak of 18G9-70, and next year, 1875-76, I expect a very much larger mortality from Scarlet Fever. The mean number of deaths from Diphtheria was 14, so that the mortality from this disease was less in 1874 than usual. Whooping Cough had the third greatest mean mortality for these years, viz. 70, whilst the number of deaths this year was only 52. Fever also was much below the average, as only 45 deaths from all kinds were recorded amongst the inhabitants, against an average for the 10 years of 59. Diarrhoea also was less than usual, as only 102 deaths were recorded against the mean of 116. The mean annual number of deaths are uncorrected for increase of population, so that for the purpose of a true comparison these numbers should have been increased by above twenty per cent, which is half the total increase of the population in these 10 years. It is therefore evident that this year the deaths from all these epidemics were considerably less than the average of 10 years with the exception of Measles. The mean annual number of deaths to 1000 total deaths in the 13 years, was 26 from Small Pox, 16 Measles, 39 from Scarlet Fever, 6 from Diphtheria, 29 from Whooping Cough, 25 from Fever, and no less than 49 from Diarrhoea, so that in proportion to total deaths Diarrhœa was far more fatal than any other disease included in this list. The mean annual number of 14 deaths from each of these causes per 10,000 population was, 56 Small Pox, 35 Measles, 80 Scarlet Fever, 12 Diphtheria, 62 Whooping Cough, 55 Fever, and 102 Diarrhoea, making a total of 402 for Hackney and 462 for all London, so that in proportion to population there was a much smaller number of deaths from these seven epidemic diseases than for all London. The mean proportion of deaths from epidemics in Hackney was 190 per 1000 deaths, and in London 198 per 1000 deaths, so that both absolutely and relatively the death-rate was less in Hackney. I now purpose discussing the effects of the seven weeks of cold weather ending January 2nd, 1875, on the public health of Hackney. During the seven weeks of moderate temperature ending November 14th, there were 317 deaths recorded, and in the seven cold weeks there were no less than 478 deaths registered, or 151 deaths in the cold period to each 100 in the warm. An excess of deaths occurred at all ages, but pro rata to population to a greater extent in persons over 65 years of age than at other periods of life. TABLE VII.

Per centage of living at each age 12.9 57.3 25.5 3.0 1.26 100 15 It will be seen that the total number of deaths included in this table is 795. In the warm period there were 127 deaths under 5 years of age, or 40.1 per cent, of the whole; 60 or 18.9 per cent, between 5 and 35 years of age; 74 or 23.3 per cent, between 35 and 65 years old; 31 or 9.8 per cent, between 65 and 75, and 25 or 7.9 per cent, of persons who were 75 years old or more. In the cold period there occurred 152 or 3.18 per cent, of the total number of deaths in children under 5 years of age; 86 or 17.9 per cent, of persons who were more than 5 and less than 35 years of age; 115 or 24.1 per cent, of persons who were between 35 and 65 years old; 61 or 12.8 per cent, of those who were between 65 and 75 ; and no less than 64 or 13.4 per cent, of inhabitants who were above 75 years old. The rate of mortality at various groups of ages varied very much, as a much smaller percentage of children under 5 years and a slightly diminished rate for those who were between 5 and 35, but an excess in the percentage of deaths in all the groups of ages above 35, especially amongst old persons. These comparisons apply to the total percentages only, because, as previously stated, the mortality was in excess during the cold period at all ages. The effect of the cold is, however, best shown by calculating the percentage of deaths at each age in the cold to 100 in the warm weather, the numbers being compared with one another and not percentages calculated in the totals. It then appears that there were 119 deaths in the cold period of children under 5 years to 100 in the warm; that there were 143 deaths of persons between 5 and 35 years of age during the cold period against 100 in the warm; 155 in the cold to 100 in the warm period of those who were between 35 and 65 years of age; the much larger proportion of 196 of persons between 05 and 75 in the cold to 100 in the temperate period; and no less than 256 of inhabitants aged 75 and upwards in the cold period to 100 in the temperate weeks. This increase in the rate of mortality of inhabitants of this district, and more especially 16 amongst those who were above 65 years of age, points out the great care which should be used by all elderly people whenever cold weather sets in. The proportion of deaths of children under 1 year old was also in excess to a small extent, as compared with those between 1 and 5, as there were 87 deaths of children under 1 year during the cold period to 71 during the warm; and 65 of children between 1 and 5 years old during the cold to 56 during the temperate period. I now purpose to ascertain the effect of the cold and warm weather in the Mortality from different cause3. TABLE VIII. Hackney.—Deaths in Seven Warm and Seven Cold Weeks from various diseases.

The number of deaths from Tubercular diseases was almost 17 unaltered, as 44 were registered in the seven warm against 46 in the seven cold weeks. Diseases of the Nervous system proved fatal to a much larger number of persons in the cold than in the warm weeks, as there were 54 in the former against 33 in the latter, or above 33 deaths against each 20 in the warm weeks. The mortality from diseases of the Circulatory Organs varied but little, 28 deaths having been registered in the warm against 29 in the cold period, but diseases of the Respiratory Organs were enormously fatal, as no less than 154 deaths from inflammatory diseases of the lungs were recorded in the cold period against 48 in the warm, so that for each 10 deaths in the warm there were 32 in the cold weeks.

It will be seen that under 5 years of age and above 75 the increase was enormous, as the mortality under 5 was only 18 in the temperate whilst it was as great as 59 in the cold period, and whilst it was only 7 amongst persons who were above 75 in the temperate, it was as large as 22 in the cold period, or more than three times as large in early childhood and in advanced age. The proportion was larger still in the ages between 55 and 75, perhaps from being more exposed to the weather, as no less than 38 deaths were registered amongst persons of these ages against only 10 in the temperate period. Between 5 and 55 an almost similar rate obtained as in early childhood and advanced 18 life, as there were 13 deaths in the temperate against 35 in the colcl period. It is, therefore, very evident that persons of all ages should adopt the greatest precautions possible against cold when the weather is very severe; that the weakly and aged should not. be unnecessarily exposed to it, for the purpose of hardening the young and keeping up the strength of the old. That good fires, plenty of food, and warm clothing should be used in cold weather by all who can afford to obtain them. I would especially impress upon School Masters and School Mistresses who have the care of large numbers of children, many of whom arrive at school cold and probably wet, the necessity of keeping up good fires in cold weather, and of allowing those who are wet to dry their clothes and especially their boots and shoes. As the whole of the deaths of inhabitants of this district which have occurred in the Small Pox and Fever Hospitals are now registered amongst the deaths, and as the mortality in the City of London Union and German Hospital about counterbalances the proportionate number of deaths in the Hospitals of London, I have not deemed it necessary to make any alterations in the number of deaths as a correction for deaths in other Hospitals of the Metropolis. I therefore assume the true number of deaths to have been 2799, although 102 deaths happened in the German Hospital and 44 in the City of London Union. If these 166 deaths of non-residents had been eliminated as they generally arc in other districts, the death rate would have been much smaller than what I calculate it to have been, viz.: 203 per 10,000 inhabitants against 218 for the whole of the Northern Districts and 226 for all London. This is a small average considering the great vicissitudes of weather during the year, but it would not have been so small if the number of deaths from epidemic diseases had not also been exceptionally small. The rate of births to deaths was extremely high, so that altogether we may conclude the health of the district to have been unusually good during the year. 19 There have been 171 inquests held during the year, of which 30 were returned as sudden deaths, 20 as the result of accidents, 26 from disease of the heart, 3 from brain disease, 2 from delirium tremens, 7 from burns or scalds, 2 from being run over, 1 from hanging, 3 from poison, 1 from a pistol shot, 17 from drowning. Amongst the sudden deaths were included, 3 from exposure to cold, one on March 11th, one on December 25th, and the other on December 26th. Three died from being struck with lightning, one on the 23rd May, and 2 during the great storm of July lltli. This terrific storm affected the whole district, but its greatest violence was expended on Hackney Wick, Homerton, Dalston, and De Beauvoir Town. There was another death recorded from swallowing lucifer matches, and a very unusual one in a child aged 8 years, from swallowing port wine. I have attended 33 meetings of the Sanitary Committee, which is above the avei'age; 14 of the View Committee; and 4 of other Committees; making a total of 41 Committee Meetings during the year. Many important matters were discussed at these meetings, amongst which I may mention the Slaughterhouse Act, and the Regulations for keeping the slaughterhouses in proper order, and also the premises in which other offensive trades are carried on; the Removal of Dust; the obtaining Returns of Births and Deaths from the District Registrars; the bad Sanitary condition of the River Lea; the precautions to bo taken against the spread of Scarlet Fever, and other matters. The regulations for the removal of dust from the houses of the inhabitants received a very large amount of attention, as the contract price per load has been increasing for the last two years, and the cost is becoming very serious. In 1873-74 there were above 16,000 loads removed at 2/11 per load, or a cost of £2344 9s., to which there were added £371 19s. for the Dust Inspector's salary and payment to the men employed by the Board to assist the Contractor, making a total of £2716 18s. For this year the 20 contract price was 2/9 per load, so that as 17,427 loads have been removed, the amount paid to the Contractor is £2353 9s. and for the Dust Inspector's salary and men's wages £441 0s. 9d., making a total of £2794 9s. 9d. The cost of the men's wages is greater than in 1873-74, because an additional eighteen-pence per week was given to each man. The arrangements were perfectly satisfactory until the cold weather came in, when in consequence of the long continued frost and the heavy falls of snow, the removal of the dust was much impeded, whilst the quantity of ashes made was much increased. Since that time we have had a good deal of difficulty in obtaining the number of carts and men required, so that at the end of the contract there was a considerable accumulation in the district, although the number of loads removed was in excess of those which were taken away in 1873-74. The lower price of coals this year also influenced the quantity of ashes, so that the removal of 17,500 loads per annum was not sufficient for the requirements of the district. There were, however, only 13G7 complaints of nonremoval of dust, the greater part of which occurred in the last three months of the contract. The provisions of the Slaughterhouse Act and the Regulations proposed by the Metropolitan Board of Works under this Act for the conduct of slaughterhouses and other offensive trades were considered at several meetings of the Committee. These Regulations or Bye-Laws have been submitted to the Local Government Board for confirmation, but up to the present time are not in force in the Metropolis in consequence of their sanction not yet having been given. By this Act it is not lawful to establish anew in the Metropolis any of the following businesses, viz : blood boiler, bone boiler, manure manufacturer, soap boiler, tallow melter, or knanckner, under a penalty not exceeding fifty pounds a day. It is also unlawful to establish anew any of the following businesses without the sanction of the local authority (which is the Metropolitan Board of Works), that is to say, of a 21 fellmonger, tripe boiler, slaughterer of cattle, or any other business which may hereafter be declared to be offensive by the Metropolitan Board of Works and the Local Government Board. The Justices sitting at Prescot Street continue to renew licenses for the slaughtering of cattle as before, and all the powers vested in this Board are continued, so that it will still be necessary for the View Committee to inspect these premises, and oppose the granting of such licenses as they may deem necessary, after having received authority from you to do so. The comparatively sudden stoppage by the Registrar-General of the returns which we have received from him for so many years led, temporarily, to a considerable inconvenience in the sanitary department, but as you have arranged with the District Registrars for regularly supplying me every Monday with a copy of the returns furnished to the Registrar-General, I find myself in a much better position than before, as I receive them three days earlier. I consider the more speedy receipt of the returns to be of great value at all periods, but more especially when an epidemic is prevailing. By the directions of the Sanitary Committee I inspected the River Lea on several occasions during the year and found the water in a very bad state, especially in autumn. I had some correspondence with the Conservators of the River Lea, and also with the Local Government Board, who informed me that the Tottenham Board had arranged to comply with the requirements of the Lea Conservancy Act, 1868, which it is quite certain that they had not done. The river is in a very bad state at present, and I fear that years will elapse before the water is restored to its original state, even if the provisions of the Act should be fully carried out. At the commencement of the scarlatinal epidemic I brought the subject under the consideration of the Sanitary Committee, 22 who directed handbills to be printed and distributed throughout the district oontaining instructions for preventing, as far as possible, the infection from spreading amongst the inhabitants. Disinfection of the excreta of the sick, of all articles of clothing, bedding, and other woollen fabrics which had been in the sick room, careful and long-continued isolation of the patients, and subsequent cleansing and disinfection of the sick rooms were especially insisted on. Copies of these handbills can be had on application to Mr. Watts. As complaints were received respecting Craven's Dock, Upper Clapton, I inspected it on several occasions, and had notices served on the owner requiring him to have it filled up, as it contained a large quantity of foul and stagnant water. Several cesspools which drained into it were abolished, and other places erected in their place which were drained into the sewer, and as the greatest part of the dock has been filled up and the nuisance abated, at any rate for the present, no further action is now necessary. My attention was drawn by Dr. Denny, of the Stoke Newington Dispensary, to an outbreak of typhoid fever in several of the small streets, courts, and similar places in Stoke Newington, Stamford Hill and West Hackney. I made an inspection of the premises and especially directed my attention to the water receptacles, but did not find anything to account for the outbreak except great carelessness in allowing the drain openings to be uncovered in some houses. It is somewhat singular that this outbreak was confined to those portions of our district which are the highest, and might perhaps have originated from the want of care in leaving the traps off the drains. I have also inspected the stables at Portland Avenue, Stamford Hill, which are used for stabling the horses used by the North London Tramway Company, and found the stable manure 23 scattered about instead of being placed in a proper receptacle, and the outside premises generally very dirty. The stables were well paved and kept. I directed the person in charge to keep the yard in better order, to have part of it repaired and a proper dung pit provided, which have been done. In the month of July last I was called by the Inspector of Nuisances to examine a large quantity of meat which was deposited in a shed in Duncan Road near London Fields, for making spiced beef and sausages. After carefully examining each piece, I directed Mr. Lewis, the chief inspector, to seize and carry away 20 pieces of beef, which he did, and took to the Worship Street Police Court for condemnation. I also directed Mr. Lewis to seize some sausage meat and polonies which were on the premises of a sausage maker at John Street, Shacklewell. I attended on two occasions to give evidence against the persons to whom the meat belonged, when the Magistrate ordered one defendant to pay £90 or to be imprisoned for one month, and the other defendant to be imprisoned for two months without the option of a fine. I inspected with the View Committee 87 cowsheds and 68 slaughterhouses, many of these two or three times. There was much difficulty in obtaining the alterations in the slaughterhouses which were deemed to be necessary before the licence was granted; and in some instances it was decided to recommend the opposition of a slaughterhouse license in consequence of the unfitness of the premises for being permanently licensed. A list was brought up in October recommending that the renewal of the licenses be opposed for 23 premises, but in consequence of the requisite works having been subsequently completed the opposition was withdrawn except in 8 cases, for which the Magistrates refused to renew the licenses. The amount of ordinary sanitary work carried out in the 24 district was rather in excess of that in any former year, as there were no less than 6,049 houses inspected, and nuisances were discovered in 2,828 of the houses, so that above 46 per cent, of the houses inspected were not in a good sanitary state from want of white-washing and repairing, or from defective paving or drainage, or want of proper water supply and apparatus. Every room in each house was examined, and entries made in the inspection books as to their state of repair, the condition of the water-butts and cisterns, the dustbins, drainage of the houses, outhouses and yards, paving of the yards, and state of the gutters. In addition there were 156 greengrocers' and 73 fishmongers'' and poulterers' yards inspected to see that there were no accumulations therein which could be injurious to health, and also that the paving and drainage were in good order and condition. The necessity for a regular inspection of all the small houses in the district is shown in a very strong manner by a comparison of the number of nuisanees abated from complaint, and as the result of the inspection. As before stated, 6049 houses were inspected under the Sanitary Act, 1866, and nuisances were discovered in 2828 houses. In some of these not only did the houses require to be repaired, but the drainage and paving were bad, so that the number of nuisances found were in excess of the houses in which they were discovered. There was also a large number of nuisances discovered in inspecting the slaughter-houses and cow-sheds, the greengrocers' and poulterers' yards, in the 129 bake-houses examined, and on other premises inspected without complaint being received here, so that out of the total 6110 nuisances only 466 were abated on complaint sent to the office, or otherwise made to the inspector. It appears that the 4,069 houses contained 26,211 rooms, 9,088 families, and 38,849 inmates, which is in excess by rather more than 2,000 of their population last year. This is to be 25 regretted, but as the average is little more than 6 to a house, the houses are not so much crowded as in many other parts of the Metropolis, and we must therefore expect a larger number of persons to occupy them in future years. Of course, the occupation of the houses by so many persons keeps up, or rather increases, the number of nuisances found in them every year although the population varies less than might have been expected. It must not be assumed that the removal of the nuisances found on the premises will make them fit in all cases for habitation, as many of the houses were originally constructed in such a bad manner and on so vicious a plan as to make them more or less unhealthy residences at all times. The powers conferred on the district surveyors should be much augmented by Act of Parliament, so as to prevent old mortar being used' in rebuilding, to insist in all houses built on made ground having the whole basement covered with Portland or other cement, and other improvements which I need not mention here. The total number of nuisances abated during the year was 6,110, which is the largest number we have ever removed in a year. They included 1,372 nuisances from defective drainage, 381 from want of proper paving, 186 from absence of dustbins, 264 from defective water supply or water supply apparatus, and 2,422 from the houses being dirty or dilapidated, or both. There were 224 houses disinfected in consequence of epidemic disease having occurred therein, and above 500 other nuisances removed. The dust inspector made 12,445 visits to houses during the year, either in his periodical inspections or in consequence of complaints received. Accumulations of dust were found in 1,352 of these houses in addition to those of the 1,357 houses concerning which complaints were made. There were also 12,400 "D" cards distributed by the inspector during the year, and the condition of 6,805 dust-bins ascertained. In 26 addition there were 395 articles disinfected at the Board's apparatus; large quantities of disinfectants were distributed to the poor, and also placed in the gullies and sewers ; 28 bodies taken to the mortuary, and 61 pads of fish condemned as unfit for human food. The number of notices served were in excess of last year, as 210 notices were given to owners of property to prevent overcrowding, and to cleanse, whitewash and repair their houses in accordance with the 34th section of the Sanitary Act, and 24 for the abatement of overcrowding. In addition to these there were 3,712 preliminary, 1,662 peremptory, and 873 statutory notices served during the year, but only 53 summonses taken out, which is the smallest for some years. Although the overcrowding cases were not numerous—viz., only 24—yet some of them were very bad. For instance; at 10, Otway Street, the inspector found the father, mother, and six children, including one of 16 and one of 14, living and sleeping in a room containing 1,914 cubic feet of air; at 13, Goring Street, the father, mother, and six young children lived and slept in a small room having a cubic capacity of only 843 feet; at 9, Ada Street, the father, mother, a son of 12, a daughter of 17, and a child under 10, lived and slept in a smaller room, the capacity of which was only 832 cubic feet; in a room which held only 484 cubic feet, in Blanchard Road, there lived and slept the mother, and six children under 10 years old; at 16, Urban Place, Sheep Lane, the father, mother, a son of 16, a girl of 13, and four others under 10, lived and slept in a room of 231 feet capacity; at 32, Palace Road, the father, mother, a son of 17, and five children under 12, lived and slept in a small room which contained only 864 cubic feet, and in Queen's Court, Well Street, the grandmother, father, mother, and six children, were discovered living and sleeping in one small room which held only 688 cubic feet. The whole of these cases were discovered on inspection, and 27 show the necessity for the house to house visitations. The injury to health and morals which must occur where overcrowding to this extent takes place is self-evident, and need not be insisted upon, and it is therefore only necessary to add that the overcrowding was in all these cases quickly remedied,—in most instances by the parents taking another room. In conclusion, I have to state that the inspectors have all carried out their duties to my entire satisfaction. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D. Medical Officer of Health.
