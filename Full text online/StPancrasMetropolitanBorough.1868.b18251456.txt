STPAN 25 Saint Pancras, Middlesex. THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, FOR THE YEAR 1868. Gentlemen, In presenting my First Annual Report on the Sanitary Condition of this parish, I labour under very considerable, and unusual disadvantages; I have to report on the Sanitary state of St. Pancras for the year 1868, during which time my connection with the parish was very slight; and the late Clerk left just at the time when he might have been of assistance in preparing statistics. The actual number of deaths registered as having occurred in Saint Pancras during the year 1868 was 4883, from which number should be deducted 88 deaths, in the Strand Union, of persons not belonging to this parish. This will reduce the number to 4795. It is impossible at this distance of time, from the last census in 1861, to determine accurately the population of the parish so as to calculate the annual rate of mortality. The population was estimated in 1866 to be 219,024; and your late lamented Medical Officer believed it to be over 220,000 in 1867. Assuming that these estimates are well founded, I may safely conclude, that, in the middle of 1868, the population was at least 221,000. Taking this number as the nearest approximation, the amount of mortality last year was 21.69 per thousand persons living. The death rate in 1867 was 21.54 per thousand. 1866 „ 28.50 1865 „ 23.72 1864 „ 25.35 1863 „ 23.06 1862 „ 21.60 In the whole of the Metropolis, with a population estimated by the 2 Registrar General at 3,126,685, the annual rate of mortality in 1868 was 23.59 per thousand living; the mortality of the Northern districts, of which St. Pancras is one, was 22.90. The mortality of this parish was therefore lower than that of the rest of London, or of that part of London in which St. Pancras is situated. The average annual rate of mortality in this parish during the six years preceding 1868 was 23.13 per thousand; consequently the mortality in 1868 was 1.44 per thousand below the average of the preceding six years. The birth-rate in St. Pancras during 1868 was 35.16 per thousand persons living—the population being estimated at 221,000, and the births at 7771, which is forty-two more than the number registered in fifty-two weeks, or three hundred and sixty-four days. The proportion of deaths 'among children under five years of age was 26.89 per cent. of those born alive; in other words, more than one-fourth of the children born in this parish die before completing their fifth year. This infantile mortality is in different districts as follows:— Gray's Inn 31.30 Camden Town (including Workhouse) 30.07 Tottenham Court 29.54 Somers Town 29.03 Kentish Town 23.25 Regent's Park 23.16 per cent. of the total births. In four out of the six sub-districts into which the parish is divided, the mortality among children under five years of age formed more than onehalf of the respective mortalities in these localities, whilst in Regent's Park and Tottenham Court the infant mortality formed less than one-half of the total mortality of those sub-districts. In Camden Town (not including the Workhouse) the infantile mortality also exceeded half the total mortality. Among preventable diseases, Small Pox stands with a smaller mortality than in 1867, since twelve deaths only were registered from this cause, besides eleven deaths among St. Pancras parishioners in the Small Pox Hospital; whilst in 1867 there were sixty-five deaths from it, besides eleven deaths in the Small Pox Hospital. From Scarlatina, the number of deaths was 237, and in 1867 only 101; thus shewing a largely increased mortality from this eminently preventible disease. 128 children died of Hooping Cough, a decrease of 38 deaths when compared with the mortality in 1867. From Diarrhoea and Cholera, 225 children and 31 adults died; the numbers in 1867 being 185 and 26 respectively. Typhus and Enteric (typhoid) Fevers were rather more fatal than in 1867, 99 deaths having occurred from them, besides 23 deaths in the London Fever Hospital among St. Pancras parishioners, making a total of 122 deaths. In 1867 the mortality from these diseases was 108. 3 Diphtheria caused 50 deaths; Croup, 88 deaths; and Measles, 102 deaths : these numbers being all in excess of those in 1867. The number of deaths from the undermentioned diseases in London and St. Pancras respectively were in 52 weeks:— London. St. Pancras. Small Pox 599 23 Diarrhoea and Cholera 4371 286 Typhus and Enteric Fevers 2427 122 Deaths in the Fever Hospital included Scarlatina 2838 237 Diphtheria 487 50 Hooping Cough 2320 128 Measles 1954 102 Pulmonary diseases (including Phthisis) ... 20681 1376 Phthisis alone 8833 675 If the annual rates of mortality from each of these diseases be calculated from these numbers, they will be for each 1000 persons living:— London. St. Pancras. Small Pox 0-19 0-10 Diarrhoea and Cholera 1-38 1-30 Typhus and Enteric Fever 0-78 0-55 Scarlatina 0-92 1-08 Diphtheria 0-16 0-23 Hooping Cough 0-75 0-58 Measles 0-63 0-46 Pulmonary diseases (including Phthisis) ... 6-67 6-24 Phthisis alone 2-84 3-06 Tables are appended, showing the mortality in the different districts into which the parish is divided in the several quarters of the year, and in the year of 52 weeks, or 364 days, ending December 26, 1868. The necessity which exists in this parish for the erection of a Disinfecting Establishment, where parishioners might have clothing, bedding, and other articles likely tc harbour infected matters disinfected, has been urged upon the "Vestry by the late Dr. Hillier in his two last Annual Reports. I can cordially re-echo all that he has said upon the subject. Year by year in St. Pancras, and throughout this Metropolis, " Preventible Diseases" do their deadly work; and it is only the fact, that they are constantly amongst us, cutting down the primest of our people, and do not slay their victims by thousands intermittently, that makes us so indifferent to then- presence. 4 Of Typhus, Enteric (typhoid) Fevers, Scarlatina, and Small Pox alone, 371 persons died in St. Pancras in 1866. I have no hesitation in saying that the mortality from these diseases might have been very largely diminished had there been proper provision, such as the Vestry is empowered to provide, by "The Sanitary Act, 1866," for the disinfection of clothing, &c. The cost of such an establishment, as one of those erected in Liverpool, would, I doubt not, be soon saved to the parish, by the saving of life that would be effected. It must be remembered that fevers (especially Typhus) attack more especially our adult population; and of the 122 persons who died from fever in St. Pancras last year, a large proportion were adult males, who had probably families dependent upon them. If we could add to these deaths, the number of those persons who were disabled and unable to work during the attacks of fever, it would be seen what distress and misery must be caused,—resulting of necessity in a largely increased poorrate. I cannot too earnestly recommend to the authorities the consideration of this question in its economic aspect. SMALL POX AND VACCINATION. The mortality from Small Pox was lower in 1868 than it has been in any year since 1861, twenty-three deaths only having occurred from this disease. I append a return kindly furnished by Mr. Moore, Clerk to the Guardians, of the number of Vaccinations performed by the public Vaccinators in the year ending Michaelmas, 1868. Of children under one year of age, 2871 were successfully vaccinated, being an increase of 820 over the preceding year. The number of registered Births in the parish during the same period was 7706. Though the number of children actually vaccinated is not at all represented in this return, it is satisfactory to find that the New Vaccination Act causes each year more children to be vaccinated. SANITARY WORKS. In the Appendix is given a Table, kindly supplied by Mr. Worrell, Chief Clerk in the Department of Works, of the principal works of Sewerage executed in the Parish during the year 1868. From this it appears that 1468 feet of large brick sewers; 1500 feet of pipe drainage; and 1594 feet of brick barrel drains have been made. Many sewers were repaired during the course of the year. Annexed is a return of the chief Sanitary improvements carried out, under the inspection of the Sanitary Officers:— VACCINATION EXTENSION ACT. SAINT PANCRAS, MIDDLESEX.

All Markets are visited at least three times in each week. The Slaughter-houses numbering 91, and Cow-houses 77, have each been inspected. Bakehouses have each been visited half-yearly, but in future they will be visited every three months. The day and hour is left to the discretion of Inspector. All courts, public urinals, stables, wharves, mews, and premises occupied by marine storedealers, fat melters, tripe dressers, sausage makers, fried fish shops, butchers' shops, stalls for sale of meat, fish, vegetables, or fruit, are inspected from time to time.

Of Meat, 1 ham, 2 joints of lamb, 2 legs, 2 breasts, 1 loin, 1 neck of lamb, 60 lbs. of pork, and 1 hare. 8 METEREOLOGY OF GREENWICH IN 1868. The mean air temperature of the year was 51°.6 Fahrenheit, or three degrees above the average. The air was unusually dry; yet the great rains at the beginning and the end of the year increased the rain-fall to 25.28 inches, which is nearly the average for Greenwich. The wind moved at a mean velocity of 12.2 miles an hour, the average of several years being 10.8 an hour; thus there was an usually great horizontal movement of the air during the year. The weather was cold during the first eleven days of the year. On January 12th, the temperature increased and passed above the average. February and March were warm both by day and night; the former month remarkably so, the weather being more like that of spring than of winter. April was warm, so also were May and June, and in July and August the heat was almost tropical. A very long period of warm weather thus prevailed from January 12th to September 80th. On the 1st of October the weather changed, and throughout the month, and also that of November, the temperature of the air, with the exception of a few slightly warm days, was generally below the average for the season. During December the weather was again unusually warm, the temperature being as much as 5'5° above the average of fifty years. REPORT ON THE GAS SUPPLY DURING THE YEAR 1868. The average illuminating power of the Gas during the whole year was 14.2 standard sperm candles. The mean of the monthly maximum results was 15.4, and the mean of the monthly minimum results was 12.8 candles. The highest illuminating power observed was 16.1, and the lowest 12.8 candles. An illuminating power of 12 candles is required by the Gas Act, 1860. The amount of sulphur in the Gas varied from 18.4 to 26.8 grains per 100 cubic feet; 20 grains being the legal maximum. Sulphuretted hydrogen was never present. Ammonia was usually present. The whole of the provisions of the "Workshop Regulation Act, 1867," only came into force at the commencement of the current year. No procedure under this statute took place in 1868 in St. Pancras, it having been resolved to defer acting upon it until the new Medical Officer of Health should be appointed. I have reason to believe that considerable duties will be entailed upon the Sanitary Department in carrying out this Act of Parliament. The "Sanitary Act, 1868," provides that Dry Earth Closets may, with the sanction of the Local Authority, be substituted in lieu of Water Closets where the latter are inapplicable. No permission for such substitution has yet been asked in this parish. May 10th, 1869. THOMAS STEVENSON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. FIRST QUARTER, 1868.
