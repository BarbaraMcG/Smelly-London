Medical Officer for Environmental Health for the Year 1974 London Borough of Wandsworth ANNUAL REPORT of MR. K. J. WINTON, M.E.H.A. Chief Environmental Services Officer and DR. J. B. MORWOOD, F.R.C.S.I., M.F.C.M., D.P.H. Medical Officer for Environmental Health for the Year 1974 CONTENTS Page INTRODUCTION 1 ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES DIVISION PREMISES 2 COMMUNICABLE DISEASES 3 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INSPECTION 9 GENERAL SECTION 10 HOUSING SECTION 19 PUBLIC SERVICES SECTION 22 REPORT OF THE WORK OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST FOR 1974 35 STAFF TRAINING 43 1 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SERVICES K.J.WINTON, M.E.H.A., Chief Environmental Services Officer The year under review saw the end of an era wherein the Medical Officer of Health's statutory appointment to the local authority ceased to exist and the Personal Health Services transferred to the Area Health Board. The Environmental Health Section was transformed into the Environmental Services Division by the incorporation of the duties for Public Control, Consumer Protection and responsibility for liaison with the Weights and Measures Consortium. Staff shortages involving public health inspectors unfortunately reached an all time low in spite of the increase in establishment of more senior posts. By the careful manipulation of the professional staff however and with the Technical Assistants being given more responsibility, each section maintained its work load and altogether 1974 was not an unsatisfactory year. Pest Control maintained its usual efficient service but this year an additional hazard in the form of foxes appeared and to date only one has been trapped. It is believed however that others may have been caught but were released by members of the public before any action could be taken. Progress was also made on the ever present problem of Gartons. A new innovation of the introduction of open days to which members of the public who had complained were invited, was introduced, and proved a great success. The New Covent Garden Market was opened towards the end of the year and the additional responsibility has been accepted without interfering to any degree with the day to day routine work of the section. All sections found that there was a marked lack of enthusiasm by owners to get works carried out to comply with notices, and as a consequence 1974 saw a very great increase in the number of cases which were referred to the Council's Solicitor for prosecution. Finally, I would like to thank Dr.J.B.Morwood for the way in which he has "settled in" with us, as the Medical Officer for Environmental Health, and also the members of the Public Services Committee for their support. 2 LIST OF ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICE DIVISION'S PREMISES Administration Headquarters The Town Hall, Wandsworth High Street, S.W.18.

The total number of confirmed cases of notifiable disease, arranged in age groups is shown in Table 2 which follows. The drop is accounted for in the greater part by the lower incidences of measles — a biennial factor. Acute Encephalitis No cases were reported during the year. Acute Meningitis During the year twenty-one cases were notified, comprising seven adults and fourteen children, the causative organisms being:- 14 Meningococcal 1 Viral 1 Haemolytic Streptococcus 1 Pneumococcal 1 Echo Type 6 Virus 3 Unknown One child and three women died. Cholera No cases were reported during the year, but a number of persons who had returned to this country from endemic areas without valid international certificates of vaccination were kept under surveillance. Diphtheria No cases were reported during the year. Dysentery A total of 111 notifications were received and, following bacteriological examination, 90 were confirmed. Three outbreaks of dysentery occurred during the year, one at a primary school and the other two at private nurseries. At the school 4 investigation revealed 22 children to be infected and in addition three positive home contacts were identified. Similar investigations at the nurseries showed 12 children and three members of the staff to be suffering from dysentery and no new admissions were therefore accepted for an appropriate period. The remaining 41 cases were single isolated incidents. Food Poisoning One hundred and nineteen notified cases were investigated during the year but after bacteriological examination, only 31 cases were confirmed, 2 cases were associated but the remaining 29 being single unrelated cases. The causative organisms of the 31 confirmed cases were of the following types:- Salmonella Typhimurium - 8 Enteritides - 7 Mounster - 4 Tennessee - 1 Kotbus - 1 Emek - 1 Give - 1 Wien - 1 Ladar - 1 Indiana - 1 Butaman - 1 0 4 G - 1 Unknown - 3 Infective Jaundice Thirty-four cases occurred during the year compared with 37 cases in 1973. Leptospirosis No cases were notified during the year. Malaria Eighteen cases were notified all of which were contracted abroad. 5 Measles A total of 318 cases were notified as against 842 last year. This decrease is consistent with the rise and fall of incidences in alternate years. Ophthalmia Neonatorum Two cases were notified during the year. Poliomyelitis and Smallpox No cases of these two serious diseases were notified in Wandsworth during the year. Paratyphoid Fever Four cases were notified and in all instances were contracted abroad. Scarlet Fever There was a decrease in the number of cases reported which totalled 31 compared with 45 in 1973. Tuberculosis The number of new cases during the year was 88, the sources of information being as follows:- Primary notifications - 77 Un-notified at death - 5 Transfers from other areas - 6 Particulars of the primary notifications during the year, classified by sex and age, are given in the following table:- 6 TABLE 1 Age Groups Prima™ Notifications Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M F M F Under 1 year - - - 1 1-4 - - - - 5-9 1 - - - 10-14 - - 1 - 15-24 5 6 7 4 25 - 44 5 5 5 6 45 - 64 12 4 - 1 65 and over 8 4 1 1 Totals 31 19 14 13 Typhoid Fever During the year four cases were reported and investigated, Three cases were of men returning from holidays abroad while the fourth case was a man who became infected through his sister who was a carrier. All family contacts were traced and bacteriological examination of all concerned revealed no further spread of infection. Whooping Cough The number of cases notified was 62 as against 42 in 1973. Bacteriological Examinations Bacteriological examination of stools and other specimens in connection with food poisoning and infectious disease was carried out by the Joint Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory at St.George's Hospital, Tooting and 1,290 specimens were examined during the year:- Stool and urine 1198 Nose and throat swabs 92 7 TABLE 2 NOTIFIABLE DISEASE NUMBER OF NOTIFIED CASES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN AGE GROUPS Under 1 year 1 2 3 4 5-9 10-14 15-24 25-44 45-64 65 and over TOTALS Acute encephalitis — — — — — — — — — — — — Acute meningitis 4 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 1 3 1 21 Acute poliomyelitis — — — — — — — — — — — — Anthrax — — — — — — — — — — — — Cholera — — — — — — — — — — — — Diphtheria — — — — — — — — — — — — Dysentery 3 6 10 10 7 34 3 4 12 1 — 90 Food poisoning 4 1 — 3 1 2 1 6 7 3 3 31 Infective jaundice — — — — — 2 1 12 18 1 — 34 Leprosy — — — — — — — — — — — — Leptospirosis — — — — — — — — — — — — Malaria — 2 2 1 — 1 2 1 7 2 — 18 Measles 13 33 57 44 34 117 14 6 — — — 318 Ophthalmia neonatorum 2 — — — — — — — — — — 2 Paratyphoid fever — — — 1 — — — — 2 1 — 4 Plague — — — — — — — — — — — — Relapsing fever — — — — — — — — — — — — Scarlet fever 1 — 2 3 2 13 10 — — — — 31 Smallpox — — — — — — — — — — — — Tetanus — — — — — — — — — — — — Tuberculosis 1 — — — — 1 1 23 20 17 14 77 Typhoid fever — — — — — — — 3 — — 1 4 Typhus — — — — — — — — — — — — Whooping cough 15 9 6 6 5 21 — — — — — 62 Yellow fever — — — — — — — — — — — Totals 43 53 78 70 50 193 34 57 67 28 19 692 8 International Certificates of Vaccination against Smallpox and Cholera Persons travelling abroad to certain specified countries are required to possess a certificate of vaccination bearing the authenticating stamp of the local authority of the area in which they were vaccinated. During the year, 6,147 such certificates of vaccination against smallpox, and 5,466 certificates in respect of cholera were stamped. For those persons proposing to travel abroad and for various medical reasons are advised against vaccination, certificates are issued to the effect that no recent cases of smallpox have occurred in the borough. 30 such certificates were issued during the year. Smallpox — Surveillance Under the Public Health (Aircraft) Regulations, 1966 and the Public Health (Ships) Regulations, 1966, persons arriving in this country from areas abroad where smallpox is endemic and who are not in possession of a valid international certificate of vaccination against smallpox must be placed under surveillance for a specific period. During the year, 49 such persons who were proceeding to addresses in the Borough were kept under observation. Immigrants The number of immigrants reported as taking up residence in the Borough during the year was 693 of whom the public health inspectors were able to contact 550 who were advised regarding registration with a family doctor and the desirability of having a chest X-ray. 9 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INSPECTION A summary of the inspections and visits carried out during the year by the staff of the Environmental Services Division is given in Table 3.

Drainage work Drainage work to new premises, reconstruction of drains to existing premises and drainage in connection with conversion schemes are carried out under the supervision of technical assistants of the department in co-ordination with the public health inspectors. Plans are required to be submitted to the Council for approval under the drainage by-laws and during the year 861 applications were received. 11 There were 2,425 tests made in connection with drainage installations and 34 connections made to the Council's sewers during the year. The clearance and maintenance of public sewers is the responsibility of the Council and maintenance costs are reclaimed from owners of properties connected to the public sewer. A close working liaison with the Technical Services Department implements the rapid clearance and repairs of public sewers. Sewerage and sewage disposal The trunk sewers and sewage disposal of London are the responsibility of the Greater London Council, and the local sewers which discharge into the trunk sewers are the responsibility of the Borough Councils. The Council's brick and pipe sewers are regularly cleansed and are reasonably adequate for their purpose. Water supply The bulk of the water supply in Wandsworth, as in the other Inner London Boroughs, is obtained from the mains of the Thames Water Authority who are responsible for its purity. Water supplies from this and other sources proved satisfactory both in equality and quantity throughout the year. All new and repaired mains are disinfected with cholorine; after a predetermined period of contact the pipes are flushed out and refilied; samples of water are then collected from these treated mains, and the mains are returned to service only after the analytical results are found to be satisfactory. The quality control from the Thames Water Authority's laboratories is carried out by means of daily sampling from the sources of supply, from the treatment works or well stations, from the distribution system and through to the consumer. Any sign of contamination or any other abnormality is immediately investigated. All dwellings in the borough, were supplied from the mains of the Thames Water Authority. No houses were permanently supplied by standpipe. 12 No artificial fluoride is added to the water supply by the Authority and where the fluoride content is indicated in the analyses it represents the naturally occurring fluoride in the water. The natural fluoride content of the mains water was 0.20 parts per million. There has been no change in policy on the question of the general fluoridation of the water supply in Wandsworth. The Council has already made a decision in favour of fluoridation but the Thames Water Authority will take no action until all the authorities whose areas are served by the Authority are similarly in favour. Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960 There are six licensed caravan sites containing a total of 19 dwellings in the Borough. Noise Abatement Act, 1960 During the year, 291 complaints concerning noise were received and investigated by the public health inspectors. Many of these complaints were again concerning laundrettes, particularly selfoperated laundrettes which are often open until a very late hour. The investigation by the inspectors in connection with these complaints has necessitated their visiting the premises in question often in the very early hours of the morning, during the evening and very late at night. This type of work outside normal working hours does put a considerable burden upon the inspectorate involved. In addition, one visit to these premises is by no means enough, and investigations are often very drawn out in trying to decide whether the best practicable means have been taken to reduce the noise, at least to a reasonable level. Noise other than industrial noise is very difficult to deal with, as it is often of an intermittent character. For example, the sounding of chimes by ice-cream vendors after hours is an offence, but unless an inspector or the police are on the spot at the time the offence is committed, no prosecution can be taken. The Act does provide, however, for any three persons aggrieved by a noise nuisance to initiate action by complaining to the Local Authority. I must again thank the Scientific Branch of the Greater London Council for the assistance which they have given to the inspectors during the past year in recording and making observations on various noise nuisances. 13 Protection of Animals The Council has an agency arrangement with the City of London Corporation whereby that Authority's veterinary officer carries out inspections of premises in respect of which applications have been made for licences under the various Animal Protection Acts. The main Acts under which action was taken during the year are as follows:- Pet Animals Act, 1951.— A pet shop may not be kept except under the authority of a licence granted in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the object of which is to regulate the sale of pet animals with particular reference to their welfare whilst being kept for sale. 27 licences were issued by the Council during 1974. Animal Boarding Establishments Act, 1963.— This Act provides that no person may keep a boarding establishment for animals (defined as cats or dogs) in the Borough except under licence. Two such licences were granted during the year. Animals (Miscellaneous Provisions) Order 1957.— Under the terms of this Order, the following Orders of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food were advertised in the 'National Press':- Diseases of Animals (Approved Disinfectants) (Amendment) Order 1974. Swine Vesicular Disease (Infected Areas) Special Orders 12-22 1974. Brucellosis (Eradication Areas) (England and Wales) Order 1974. Teschen Disease Order 1974. Breeding of Dogs Act 1973. Land Charges Act, 1925 During the year, the Department dealt with 9,348 enquiries relating to local land charges. These enquiries necessitate a careful search of records and drainage plans, to ascertain the existence of any orders or restrictions on the properties concerned such as outstanding statutory or informal notices, certificates of disrepair under the Rent Acts, inclusion in housing development programmes or slum clearance areas. Common lodging houses There are no registered common lodging houses in the Borough. 14 Town Planning applications 907 applications were received from the Town Planning Department for observations and recommendations were sent to the applicants regarding their proposed development in appropriate cases. The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 This Act gives the Council power to require steps to be taken to eradicate and, where possible, to prevent infestation by rats and mice. These duties are carried out by the pest control officer, his assistant and three rodent operatives. All infestations coming to light, whether by complaint or otherwise, are systematically investigated and appropriate action taken. Where the cause of the trouble is obviously a defective drain or other structural defect in the building, the owner is called upon to effect the necessary repairs. This aspect of the work involves close co-operation between the rodent control staff and public health inspectors. During the year, 3,798 complaints of infestation were received in respect of which a total of 7,901 visits were made by the staff. Again, more than two-thirds of these complaints related to the presence of mice, whereas those concerning rats have again decreased. The increase in mice complaints is disturbing and various methods, including the old-fashioned mouse trap, have been used. In addition to the work of rodent control, the pest control officer continued to carry out evening "forays" on pigeons roosting under railway bridges in the Borough. The bridges are a favourite breeding ground and by attacking the pigeons at their roosting sites profitable results have been obtained, over 1,000 birds and eggs being taken during the year. 15 ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION Clean Air Acts 1956 and 1968 Legislation 1. Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 S.1.2170 Clean Air Enactments (Repeals and Modifications) Regulations 1974 These regulations contain repeals and modifications of provisions in certain acts and instruments which have been superseded by the coming into force of the above Act on 1st January, 1975, and by the establishment of the Health and Safety Executive. Two sections of the Clean Air Acts 1956 and 1968, relating those Acts to the workings of the Alkali and etc.. Works Regulation Act 1906, are repealed viz. (1) Clean Air Act 1956 S. 17(3) conferring powers on the Secretary of State to amend orders extending the Alkali etc.. Act 1906. (2) Clean Air Act 1956 S.11(5) limiting the operation of the Public Health (Smoke Abatement) Act 1926 and the Alkali etc.. Act 1906. 2. Department of the Environment Circular 47/74 Fuels for exempted fireplaces - "Housewarm" Permits the use of this fuel as an approved fuel. 3. Department of the Environment S.1.762 of 30th April, 1974 and S.I.855 of 29th May, 1974 Smoke Control Areas (Exempted Fireplaces) Variation Orders 1 and 2 These exempt certain classes of fireplaces subject to conditions laid down for their proper operation. Smoke Control Orders The Council's Seventh and final Smoke Control Order, completing the Council's smoke control programme, was made in November 1974, and at the end of the year was awaiting confirmation by the Secretary of State for the Environment. 16 Smoke, dust and grit nuisances and observations (a) Nuisances Number of Visits 240 Number of Revisits 154 (b) Observations 48 Installation of furnaces Notification is required, under Section 3 of the Clean Air Act, 1956, of any proposal to install a furnace with a heating capacity of 55,000 or more British thermal units per hour. This section, which does not apply to furnaces designed solely or mainly for use for domestic purposes, is designed to ensure that any new furnaces installed shall be, as far as is practicable, capable of being operated continuously without emitting smoke. One such notification was received during the year. Measurement of atmospheric pollution Daily readings of the concentration of smoke and sulphur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere were continued during the year at the three stations in the Borough where recording apparatus is maintained A record of these readings in microgrammes per cubic metre for the year under review is given in Table 5 below. The readings are taken by members of the staff of the department and the information is passed to the Department of Trade and Industry for collation with data received from authorities all over the country.

The patient's room is sprayed with a formaldehyde solution. The doors and windows are closed and the room can be used again after five or six hours. Advice is also given to the occupiers that a thorough "spring cleaning" of the room is a very effective "disinfection" process, and should be carried out in addition to the work of disinfection by the Council's staff. Bedding and clothing are collected and steam-treated at the Disinfecting Station. Sheets, pillow cases and hand towels are exposed to formalin vapour in a special chamber prior to being washed in the Council's laundry. Books and other articles which cannot be steam disinfected are also treated by exposure to a formalin vapour. During the year 209 disinfections were carried out. Disinfestation of vermious rooms: Articles in the room requiring treatment are removed for steam disinfestation. The room is sprayed with an insecticide containing Pybuthrin and Lindane/ D.D.T. which has a prolonged residual effect. Where there is heavy infestation, architraves and mouldings are required to be eased for deeper penetration of the insecticide. In 1974, 889 premises were disinfested for vermin. Control of insect pests: The construction in large blocks of flats, of covered ducts for hot water, plumbing and drainage pipes has sometimes been a cause of insect infestation. These ducts form an ideal harbourage for insects which would be difficult to deal with by normal hand spraying. A Microsol Mist Generator is therefore used for the purpose and this apparatus, which has a small motor unit, is capable of spraying a fine mist or fog of insecticide to a distance of 50 feet, the mist settling on to the surfaces of the duct and the piping contained therein. Personal cleansing station Seventy-seven treatments were given during the year at the personal cleansing station to persons suffering from scabies, 22 to school children, 55 to adults and children under school age. In addition, 758 treatments for verminous conditions were given, 18 641 to schoolchildren, 117 to adults and children under school age. Coroner's Court and Mortuary Details of post-mortem examinations and inquests held at the Coroner's Court, and of bodies received into the mortuary during 1974 are set out in the following table:- TABLE 6 Details of bodies received Usual place of residence Totals Wandsworth Merton Elsewhere Unknown Post-mortem only 656 345 136 56 1,133 Post-mortem and inquest 59 30 38 6 133 Total post-mortems 715 375 174 62 1,326 Inquest only — — — — — Total inquests 59 30 38 6 133 Total bodies received 715 375 174 62 1,326 VERDICTS AT INQUESTS HELD Accidental /misadventure 26 11 25 — 62 Alcoholism 3 1 — — 4 Natural causes — —- 2 1 3 Open verdict 5 —- 3 2 10 Suicide 22 16 7 31 48 Homicide 3 2 1 —- 6 Drug Addiction —- —- —- —- —- TOTALS 59 30 38 6 133 In addition to the above, a further 72 inquests were held at the Coroner's Court although the bodies were not required to be received in the mortuary. 19 HOUSING SECTION Housing Act, 1957 Closing Orders — Under Section 157 of the Act, 5 individual houses, 3 parts of houses and 8 basements were represented for closure; four Closing Orders were made under Section 17(1) and 10 Closing Orders under Section 18. Under Section 27, Closing Orders were determined in respect of four houses, one part of a house and three basements and permission was given for one house subject to a Closing Order to be used for storage purposes. Housing Acts, 1961-1969 Houses in multiple occupation 24,028 visits were made in this connection during the year, a total of 6,177 houses being visited for the first time of which 1,701 were found to be in multiple occupation, bringing the total of such houses on record to 10,455. An analysis shows the occupation of these houses to be as follows:- Occupancies: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10+ No. of houses: 6,845 1,796 803 401 266 151 78 51 64 The general practice is to try to get properties in multiple occupation brought up to a standard acceptable to the Corporation by informal action, and although a considerable amount of work is carried out by owners voluntarily, others have not been co-operative, and consequently it has been necessary to serve 108 notices under Section 16 of the Housing Act 1961, requiring the provision of means of escape in case of fire, and 58 notices under Section 15 of the Act requiring the provision of additional facilities within the premises. In seventeen instances the owners failed to comply with these notices and the work was carried out in default. The work carried out by owners, both voluntarily and following the service of notices, resulted in 314 houses being brought up to standard. In some cases houses are over-occupied and the most satisfactory method of dealing with them is by making a Direction Order under Section 19 of the Housing Act 1961 which imposes 20 a limit of persons and households. 136 such Orders were made during the year and a further 67 notices of intention to make Orders were served. Two existing orders were varied to a higher number following improvements to the properties and five orders were determined. In 13 instances where failure †o maintain a proper standard of management existed. Management Orders were made; these Orders require the person managing the premises to ensure the cleanliness, repair and maintenance of all the common parts of the property. Twelve Section 14 notices were subsequently served on owners who failed to carry out the requirements of the Order. Housing Finance Act, 1972 Qualification Certificates Provided a rent controlled dwelling satisfies the qualifying conditions, a landlord is empowered to apply to the Rent Officer for an increase in rent. The following is a summary of applications received and action taken during the year:- TABLE 7 Section 29(1)—Where a dwelling does not have all the amenities:- Application received 17 Certificates of Provisional Approval issued 9 Qualification Certificates issued 1 Section 28(1)-Where a dwelling already satisfies the conditions:- Applications received 29 Notices of Refusal to issue Qualification Certificates 3 Qualification Certificates issued 14 Rent Act, 1968 This Act provides, amongst other things, for the issue by the Council of certificates of disrepair to tenants of controlled dwelling houses which are considered to be in disrepair by reason of defects which ought reasonably to be remedied, having regard to 21 the age, character and locality of the dwelling. There is also provision for the issue, by landlords, of undertakings to remedy such defects. The following is a summary of action taken in this connection during the year:- TABLE 8 Applications for certificates of disrepair received 1 Undertakings received from landlords 1 Work in default During the year work in default was carried out by contractors on behalf of the Council in respect of notices or orders not complied by owners. Greater London Council (General Powers) Act 1967 Section 23 5 Greater London Council (General Powers) Act 1972 Section 19 3 Housing Act 1961 Section 15 2 Housing Act 1961 Section 16 15 Public Health Act 1936 Section 39 7 Public Health Act 1936 Section 45 4 Public Health Act 1936 Section 93 9 (Nuisance Orders obtained from Court) Public Health Act 1961 Section 26 2 22 PUBLIC SERVICES SECTION FOOD AND FOOD PREMISES In order to ensure that food businesses are supervised systematically, an up-to-date register is maintained of all premises where such business is carried on. Supervision is governed mainly by powers under the Food and Drugs Act, 1955 and regulations made thereunder but there are numerous other Acts of Parliament which relate to specific types of food. The supervision of catering establishments and premises where food is sold, stored, manufactured or prepared for sale is carried out by the Public Health Inspectors in the Public Services Section. Samples of food and drugs for analysis by the Public Analyst are obtained by an officer of this section and a detailed account of this work appears later in this section of the report.
