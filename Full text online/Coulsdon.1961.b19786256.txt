The health of the District remains good and the vital statistics compare favourably with those of the country as a whole. No case of poliomyelitis occurred. Fourth injections of Salk vaccine were given to 6,574 children of primary school age in addition to the routine vaccination programme. Salk vaccine has one disadvantage as I reported last year. It does not prevent children from becoming carriers and I am very pleased, therefore, that oral vaccine is now available. Not only is it as effective as the Salk vaccine in protecting the individual but it also prevents the carrier state. A new section on bronchitis has been added this year. Bronchitis is not among the commonest causes of death, but it causes a great deal of ill health in its chronic form. It is preventable and any action that can be taken with this in view is well worth while. In conclusion I should like to thank the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their continued support and the staff for their keen co-operation during the year. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. B. MORWOOD Medical Officer of Health. 4 HEALTH REPORT FOR 1961 PART 1 AREA AND POPULATION The Urban District of Coulsdon and Purley was constituted by an Order of the Local Government Board dated 1st November, 1914, and came into existence on the 7th April, 1915. It has therefore been a separate District for just over 47 years. Situated on the North Downs and for the most part in the Green Belt it is a well favoured residential area. The District has an area of 11,142 acres, these being distributed among the wards as follows:— Coulsdon East 2,812 Coulsdon West 1,253 Kenley 1,292 Purley 685 Sanderstead 2,311 Selsdon and Farleigh 1,924 Woodcote 865 The mid year population was 73,800 in 1961 as compared with 63,770 at the time of the 1951 census. These numbers include persons resident in institutions and schools in the District, the numbers of which at the end of 1961 were as follows:— Cane Hill Hospital 2,185 Netherne Hospital 1,979 Russell Hill School 213 Reedham School 220 In December, 1961 there were 21,254 occupied houses, distributed as follows:— Coulsdon East 3,592 Coulsdon West 3,225 Purley 2,833 Woodcote 1,828 Sanderstead North 2,666 Sanderstead South 3,192 Selsdon and Farleigh 1,921 Kenley 1,997 This gives an average of 3.47 persons per occupied house in 1961, or 3.25 if the institutional population is excluded. 5 PART 2 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (in acres) 11.142 Registrar-General's estimate of population, mid 1961 73,800 Population, Census 1951 63,770 Population, Census 1961 74,738 Number of occupied houses, December, 1961 21,254 Number of occupied houses, 1951 18,071 Number of occupied houses, 1931 9,533 Rateable Value, December, 1961 £1,410,113 Sum represented by a penny rate £5,780 VITAL STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR 1961 M F Live births 1,116 Live-births - Legitimate 531 537 Live birth rate per 1,000 population 15.1 Live-births - Illegitimate 24 24 Corrected 16.3 Illegitimate live births per cent of total live births = 4.3 Still-births 17 Still-births - Legitimate 5 11 Still-birth rate per 1,000 live and still-births 15.0 Still-births - Illegitimate 1 - Total live and still-births 1,133 Infant deaths - Infant deaths 13 Legitimate 5 7 Infant deaths - Illegitimate - 1 Infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births - total 11.6 Infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births - legitimate 11.2 Infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births - illegitimate 20.8 Neo Natal Mortality rate per 1,000 live births (first four weeks) 8.9 Early Neo Natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births (first week) 7.1 Perinatal Mortality Rate per 1.000 live and still-births (still-births and deaths under 1 week combined) 22.0 Maternal deaths (including abortion) - Maternal mortality rate per 1,000 live and still-births - Deaths 886 M F 386 500 Death rate per 1,000 population 12.0 Corrected 9.0 6 VITAL STATISTICS The following table gives the average population, birth, death, maternal and other important mortality rates for the quinquennial periods 1920-1959 together with the actual figures for 1961.

It will be seen by reference to the preceding table that this is equal to an annual birth rate of 15.1 per 1,000 population, which is the same as that for 1960. If this rate is corrected in accordance with the RegistrarGeneral's assessment of the atypical constitution of the population it becomes 16.3 and this is comparable with the birth rate for England and Wales which was 17.4. Illegitimacy.—In 1961, of the births registered, 48 were illegitimate (24 males and 24 females), this being 8 more than in the preceding year. Stillbirths.—The number of still-births registered during 1961 was 17 (6 males and 11 females), which is 5 more than last year. The local still-birth rate was 15.0 per thousand live and still births. 7 DEATHS The number of deaths registered during 1961 as belonging to this District was 886 (386 males and 500 females), an increase of 2 compared with the previous year. Of this total 236 deaths (71 males and 165 females) occurred in the mental hospitals. The uncorrected death rate was 12.0, but the corrected death rate which allows for the high proportion of deaths occurring in the mental hospitals is 9.0 which compares with the rate of 12.0 for England and Wales. In order that a more accurate comparison can be made, the records in respect of normal residents have been kept separate from those of mental hospital patients and a full list of the causes of deaths and the ages at which they occurred is given in Tables III and IV. The principal causes of death during 1961 are shown in the following table:— TABLE II Cause. Number of Deaths General Population Mental Hospitals Vascular lesions of nervous system 100 14 Heart and circulatory diseases 239 103 Pneumonia 27 64 Bronchitis 22 6 Accidents 33 3 Malignant neoplasms other than lung 106 10 Malignant neoplasm, lung 30 2 HEART AND CIRCULATORY DISEASE Among the ordinary residents the death rate from heart and circulatory disease was 3.23 compared with an average of 3.55 in the preceding five years. CANCER The number of deaths from malignant neoplasms in the general population was 136. Thirty of these, i.e. 22% were due to malignant neoplasm (cancer) of the lung. This is to a large extent a preventable condition as it has been shown to be associated with prolonged and heavy cigarette smoking and, to a lesser extent, atmospheric pollution. Young people should be told of the serious risk associated with cigarette smoking before they get the habit. 8 BRONCHITIS There were 28 deaths from this disease, 19 males and 9 females. Smoking may have been a factor which would account for the excess of male over female deaths, but another factor which would account for the exceptional prevalence of this disease in England was brought to my attention by a Finnish doctor I met at a meeting of the Royal Society of Health. I asked him — "Why is bronchitis the Englishman's disease?" He replied — "It is because of your cold English bedrooms." This is a theory well worth considering as there is no doubt that bedrooms in this country tend to be cold. The outstanding reason why English bedrooms are cold in winter is because the windows are kept open; it is almost impossible to compare the incidence of chronic bronchitis among those who keep their windows open in winter with its incidence in those who keep their windows closed, as it is very difficult to find anyone in the second category in this country! Cold by itself may not be harmful to a person in good health, but a child with whooping cough who does not normally suffer a great deal during the day when he is down in the living room with the fire going suffers the spasms of whooping cough when he goes up to his cold bedroom at night. This may give rise to lung damage and subsequent chronic bronchitis. Cold fogs, on the other hand, have a precipitating effect on the exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and are associated with a high death rate among sufferers from this disease, especially old people. In my opinion the following two measures would have an effect in cutting down the incidence of chronic bronchitis:— 1. Houses should be effectively insulated. This is the case, in the main, in houses constructed by this Council. 2. Bedroom windows should be kept shut in cold weather, especially cold foggy weather. Ventilation into the hall through the open bedroom door is quite adequate. It is going to be difficult to get people to do this as they take a Spartan pride in keeping bedroom windows open throughout the winter, presumably because of propaganda left over from the seriously overcrowded conditions of the nineteenth century. There must be some 'custom of the country' which predisposes to chronic bronchitis and it may well be that the cold English bedroom is this factor. 9 TABLE III DEATHS OCCURRING DURING THE YEAR 1961.

P = normal residents. MATERNAL MORTALITY I am pleased to report that no maternal death occurred during 1961. The maternal mortality rate for England and Wales was 0.33 per 1,000 live and still births. INFANT MORTALITY During 1961 there were only 13 deaths among children under one year of age as compared with 20 last year and an average of 17 in the last five years. One of the deaths was in respect of an illegitimate child. The resultant infant mortality rate was 11.6 per 1,000 registered births, compared with an average of 16.1 for the previous five years. The infant mortality rate for England and Wales was 21.6. The 10 babies dying in the first month correspond with a neonatal rate of 8.9 (i.e. deaths in the first month per 1,000 live births) whereas the average for the past five years was 12. The 8 babies dying in the first week correspond with an early neo-natal rate of 7.1. During the year 11 premature babies were notified as being bom at home and 40 in institutions. It is pleasing to report that of the latter only three died, one within the first twenty-four hours and two within the first month after birth. 12 13 TABLE V INFANT MORTALITY DURING THE YEAR 1961 Cause of Death Under 1 week. 1-2 weeks. 2-3 weeks. 3-4 weeks.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THEIR CONTROL The following table indicates the number of cases of infectious diseases notified during 1961, the number admitted to hospital and the number of deaths which occurred. TABLE VI Disease. Numbers Notified. Admitted to Hospital. Total Deaths. Scarlet fever 43 3 - Acute pneumonia 17 1 — Measles 884 11 — Whooping cough 30 — — Erysipelas — — — Dysentery 42 30 — Food poisoning 1 — — Acute poliomyelitis — — — Puerperal pyrexia 1 — — Diphtheria — — — Paratyphoid B 1 1 — Acute encephalitis 1 1 — Meningococcal infection 1 1 — A further analysis of these cases by ages, wards and the months during which they occurred is given in Tables XVII and XVIII in the Appendix and the number of cases of infectious disease notified since 1931 is given in Table XIX in the Appendix. It will be seen that tuberculosis is omitted from this list of infectious diseases, as it is dealt with separately later. The incidence of whooping cough remained low but measles was very prevalent. SCARLET FEVER There were 43 cases of scarlet fever, approximately half the number that occurred in 1960, three being admitted to hospital. This disease is difficult to control and it is fortunate that in recent years it has become a very much milder disease than it used to be. ACUTE PNEUMONIA During the year 17 cases occurred, one being admitted to hospital. MEASLES 1961 was an epidemic year for measles; 884 cases occurred compared with only 60 in the previous year. Eleven cases were admitted to hospital. Immunisation is still not available against this disease although work is proceeding on a vaccine and it remains one of the commonest diseases of childhood. 14 ACUTE ENCEPHALITIS One of the measles cases developed into a case of acute postinfectious encephalitis. The patient made a complete recovery. WHOOPING COUGH Thirty cases of whooping cough were notified, six more than in 1960. None was admitted to hospital. This comparatively low figure continues the low incidence of this disease since 1956, indicating the value of immunisation and the importance of immunising all young children. The number of children immunised against this disease was 1,233 and 495 were given reinforcing injections. DYSENTERY Forty-two cases of dysentery occurred, the majority among patients in a mental hospital. The disease was mild and energetic action in association with the Public Health Laboratory Service limited the extent of the outbreak. FOOD POISONING Only one case occurred, the organism responsible being salmonella typhi murium. It was not possible to identify the food responsible. PARATYPHOID B. One case of paratyphoid fever occurred. The patient was a student at an agricultural college. It was not possible to incriminate any food she had eaten but she had been handling manure mixtures in the course of her work and it is possible that she had become infected by one of these. She made a complete recovery. MENINGOCOCCAL INFECTION One case occurred in a child aged one year and three months. The disease was complicated by septicaemia and the patient died. POLIOMYELITIS No case of poliomyelitis occurred. With regard to vaccination, priority was given to fourth injections of children of primary school age (i.e. 5 to 11 years). These children, 6,574 in number, received their injections in an intensive campaign held in the early summer. Thanks to the co-operation of the head teachers of the maintained 15 and independent schools, it proved possible to complete the whole campaign on school premises in the short space of eight weeks. The total number of persons of all ages in the South Eastern Division who had been vaccinated against poliomyelitis by the end of 1961 with three injections was 39,102 DIPHTHERIA No case of diphtheria occurred during the year but this disease is becoming more common throughout the country as a whole. The number of cases in England and Wales was 52 compared with 53 in 1960. It is, therefore, more important than ever that parents should have their children immunised and arrange for reinforcing injections when they are 5 and 10 years old. The number of children immunised against this disease was 1,308 and 1,720 were given reinforcing injections. PUERPERAL PYREXIA One mild case occurred. SMALLPOX The substantial degree of protection from smallpox which the population had during the time of compulsory vaccination is being slowly reduced due to the reduction throughout the country in the numbers of children vaccinated at the appropriate time. The percentage of infants under one year vaccinated in this District during the year was 78% and efforts are being made to increase this figure which is well above the most recently published figure of 38.4% for the country as a whole. As with diphtheria immunisation, all medical practitioners providing general medical services in the area are given an opportunity to provide services for carrying out vaccination. The number of primary vaccinations carried out was 1,098 and the number of re-vaccinations was 113. TETANUS Tetanus is not notifiable and its incidence is not known. Cases do occur, however, and there have been several fatal cases in Surrey during recent years including one in Purley in 1959. It is hoped that parents will have their children immunised against this disease as well as the other diseases of childhood. The tetanus prophylactic injection is usually a combined one with whooping cough and diphtheria prophylactics so that no extra injections are necessary. The number of children immunised against this disease was 1,346 and 472 were given reinforcing injections. 16 TUBERCULOSIS The following table presents concisely the position with regard to tuberculosis in the District during 1961:— TABLE VII Pulmonary.

The Council is responsible for rehousing, one of the most important measures in the prevention of this disease, and also for disinfection, but the County Council bears the responsibility for all other preventive measures except the treatment of cases which is that of the Regional Hospital Board. There are several methods of control of tuberculosis and their efficient implementation is important in view of the fact that 24 new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were notified in 1961, the average for the last five years being 33. Among these methods the following are especially effective: Mass X-ray. This has brought to light early cases which have been treated and rendered non-infectious in a short time. 18 B.C.G. Vaccination of School Children. This protects the vulnerable under 25 years age group. Contacts. Tracing contacts and arranging for treatment of those found to be suffering is important in the prevention of spread of the disease. BACTERIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL EXAMINATIONS Almost all the specimens requiring bacteriological examination in the interests of the public health are sent to the Public Health Laboratory, West Hill House, West Hill Road, Epsom, whilst samples of water requiring chemical analysis and Food and Drug samples are submitted to the Public Analyst. During 1961 reports were received on the following specimens:- Milk, ice cream and water samples 320 Food utensils 451 Nose and throat swabs 10 Faeces 236 Sputum 1 Miscellaneous foods 128 Blood 1 Faeces for enterovirus survey (all negative) 148 19 FACTORIES ACTS 1937 to 1959 PART I OF THE ACT 1.

The water is softened and chlorinated and all houses in the District are provided with a direct supply which was satisfactory in quality and quantity during the year. There are no private wells in the District with the exception of the one at Cane Hill Hospital which is used to supplement the public supply. Routine samples of the treated water in public supply were submitted quarterly for bacteriological and chemical examination. In all, 24 samples were taken for bacteriological examination and 8 samples for chemical examination with satisfactory results in each case. No samples of raw water were submitted by the department for bacteriological examination. In addition, both the Water Companies and Local Authorities sharing these public supplies provided the department with copies of reports on the samples taken by them of the treated water in public supply. Forty-eight samples were taken from the supplies of the two Companies and examined for hardness by the department, all of which were satisfactory in that adequate softening had been carried out as required. The private supply at Cane Hill Hospital which is chlorinated is kept under supervision and sampled regularly by the Public Health Department of the London County Council. Copies of reports on the samples taken are submitted to the department for information. During the year, consultations took place with officials of The Sutton District Water Company in respect of the Company's proposed application to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government for permission to increase the rate of pumping at the Cheam Pumping Station to meet the. increased demand for water. Assurances were received from the Company's officials that the proposals would result in no difference in the quality or degree of hardness of the water supplied to the Urban District. RAINFALL The rainfall registered by the Automatic rain gauge installed at Alderstead Heath was 30.11 inches in 1961, a decrease of 8.37 inches compared with the previous year. 22 The monthly totals throughout the year were as follows:— inches January 4.14 February 2.85 March 0.14 April 2.84 May 1.76 June 1.91 July 1.37 August 1.90 September 3.18 October 451 November 2.55 December 2.96 PUBLIC SWIMMING BATHS There are two swimming baths in the District used by the public; one, an open-air pool at Selsdon, is owned privately and although operating primarily in conjunction with a large hotel, is made available to the general public at a charge. The second is a covered bath situated at Reedham School which is used extensively by the Divisional Education Authority for school children. Both baths are filled and replenished as and when necessary from the public supply and provided with the necessary plant for chlorination and filtration. In addition there is a Teaching Swimming Pool at the Keston County Primary School provided for the scholars and this pool is also equipped with the necessary filtration and chlorination plant. During the year 22 samples of the water in these baths were submitted for chemical and bacteriological examination and with the exception of three samples the reports proved satisfactory. Adverse reports are thoroughly investigated and steps taken to effect a remedy. In addition regular tests are carried out by an Inspector to check the chlorine content and the Ph value of the water. SEWERAGE By agreement, sewage from the District drains into the sewerage systems of the Croydon Borough Council and the West Kent Main Sewerage Board for treatment. By far the most serious problem affecting the District under this heading is the flooding that occurs and has occurred for many years at Purley Corner. The outfall sewer to Croydon, receiving sewage from this District and from the neighbouring Urban Authorities of Caterham and Banstead is totally inadequate in times of heavy rainfall. 23 During the year under review the Minister of Housing and Local Government announced his decision on the report of his Inspector following a public local enquiry held to consider the measures to be taken to relieve this problem. A draft scheme submitted to the Minister and confirmed subject to certain amendments and modifications recommended by the Inspector, makes provision for a new sewer from Purley Corner to Warham Road to be constructed by the Croydon Corporation at their expense. It is hoped that there will now be a speedy solution to a long standing nuisance. From time to time local flooding takes place at other points in the District in periods of heavy rainfall and these matters are receiving consideration. 24 PART 3 PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES Since 1948 the local Council has been represented on the S.E. Divisional Health Sub-Committee of the County Health Committee and the corresponding Educational Executive, which bodies have certain specified powers and responsibilities for the Personal Health Services. The Medical Officer of Health for this District and his Deputy, who hold similar positions in the Caterham and Warlingham Urban District, are the officers responsible for the Divisional Health Services which include the following:— Ante Natal Clinic An Ante Natal Clinic is held at 62, Whytecliffe Road, Purley, every Wednesday, 10 a.m. - 12 noon. Home Help Service The activities of this service continue to increase, particularly as there is no comparable agency in this District. Applications for the service of a Home Help should be addressed to the Home Help Organiser, 115 Brighton Road, Purley. In case of emergency the following telephone numbers may be used: UPLands 7014 or 9277, preferably between 9.30 and 10.30 a.m. Home Helps can only be supplied for maternity cases and for other cases genuinely needing their assistance in which ill-health or old-age are involved; the capacity of the Service is limited and priority is given to those in greatest need, the degree of help varying with the physical and social circumstances of the family. Family Planning The local Family Planning Clinic is now held at the Surrey County Council Clinic, Chaldon Road, Caterham-on-the-Hill. Residents needing advice are seen only by appointment and this should be obtained by application to the Divisional Medical Officer at 115 Brighton Road, Purley. Health Visiting The Health Visitors can be contacted through the Divisional Health Visitor between 9.0 and 10 a.m. daily at 115 Brighton Road, Purley, UPLands 9277. Infant Welfare Clinics The following Infant Welfare Clinics are held regularly from 2-4 p.m. except Purley Clinic which is held from 10 a.m. - 12 noon and Selsdon and Coulsdon Youth Centre 9.30 a.m. - 12 noon and 1.30 p.m. to 4 p.m.:- Purley Clinic, 62 Whytecliffe Road, Purley Every Tuesday Methodist Church, Brighton Road, Coulsdon Every Thursday. Coulsdon Youth Centre, Chipstead Valley Road, Coulsdon Every Monday. 25 Territorial Army Drill Hall, Marlpit Lane, Old Coulsdon Every Tuesday. Memorial Hall, Godstone Road, Kenley Every Friday. British Legion Hall, Dulverton Road, Selsdon Every Monday. Congregational Church, Sanderstead Road, Sanderstead Every Wednesday. St. Anthony's Church, Wentworth Way, Sanderstead Every Thursday. Church Hall, Mitchley Avenue, Purley 2nd and 4th day in each month. Community Centre, Hooley 1st and 3rd Wednesday in each month. Rent Office, Cherry Tree Farm Estate, Sanderstead Every Wednesday. Rent Office, Wontford Road, Purley 1st and 3rd Tuesday. Mothercraft and Relaxation Classes Classes covering these subjects were commenced in Purley at the end of 1953 and the numbers attending have increased very rapidly. Expectant mothers wishing to join these classes should make application to the Divisional Health Visitor at 115 Brighton Road, Purley, who will inform them as soon as a vacancy occurs. School Health Service The basis of this service is the periodical medical and dental inspection of all the children in attendance at the local schools who, in this Division, now number over 14,000 compared with 7,490 in 1946. Some of the defects noted need to be kept under observation and others are referred for treatment by private doctors, hospitals or specialist clinics. Among the clinics organised are the dental, eye, speech, general medical, child guidance and remedial exercise clinics. Special attention is given to handicapped children, some of whom require to be admitted to special schools, e.g. those for the deaf and mentally or physically sub-normal. Welfare Services The staff of the Health Department work in close cooperation with the local representatives of the County Council's Welfare, Children's and Education Departments and such voluntary bodies as the Guild of Social Service, N.S.P.C.C. and Marriage Guidance Council. The Divisional Medical Officer is responsible for co-ordinating the activities of all concerned with "Problem Families" and children neglected in their own homes. In addition to emergency meetings, all current cases are reviewed at quarterly case conferences. 26 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, SECTION 47 The powers given under this Section for securing the removal of aged persons living in insanitary conditions were not utilised during 1961. Periodically border-line cases occur in which the Welfare Officers seek advice, but every endeavour is made to find a satisfactory solution without resorting to compulsory powers. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, SECTION 50 Under the above section, as from 5th July, 1948, the Council became responsible for the disposal of the remains of any person who dies in the District if suitable arrangements would not otherwise be made. During the year the Council were not requested to deal with cases of this type. HEALTH PROPAGANDA Constant attention is given to the opportunities for health propaganda at the Clinics and Centres in the area and during the visits made by the Health Visitors and Public Health Inspectors. In addition each year a number of talks are given by the Officers to various organisations and schools. The material supplied by the Central Council for Health Education and other bodies is extremely useful. LOCAL HEALTH SERVICES EXHIBITION An exhibition was held for two weeks in January, 1961 under the auspices of N.A.L.G.O. in the entrance hall of the council offices, showing many facets of the work carried out by the Public Health Department of the Coulsdon and Purley Urban District Council and the South-Eastern Division of the Surrey County Council. The motif was "The Home and Family". The family group was represented by a model house on a turntable and the services available for the family were demonstrated by models, photographs and charts. The most important aspects of District Council work were dealt with in two main sections; "Prevention of Infectious Diseases", including a large model demonstrating the preparation of poliomyelitis vaccine, and "Work of the Public Health Inspectors". The following services administered by the Surrey County Council were demonstrated The District Nurse Service, the Maternity and Child Welfare Service, the School Health Service 27 the Dental Service and the Physiotherapy Service. Considerable interest was shown in the Spirometer on the Physiotherapy stand and Councillors and Officers had a friendly competition as to who could blow the greatest amount of air into this piece of apparatus. No one actually blew the cylinder off its stand but one or two members of the staff very nearly did ! There was also a Home Safety Section dealing with all aspects of home safety with particular reference to the prevention of accidents by burns. This exhibition was given good publicity in the Press and many members of the public came to see it. The photograph, published by the kind permission of the Editor of the Croydon Times, shows the Chairman of the Council, Councillor H. W. Hayden, J.P., and Mr. H. L. W. Cherry, President of the Coulsdon and Purley Branch of N.A.L.G.O. at the opening of the Exhibition.

In addition to normal statutory duties, the calls on the department for advice and assistance on environmental health matters were fully maintained during the year as will be seen from the statistics recorded in the body of this report. The work of the department was, however, somewhat disorganised during the summer by the occurrence of a serious fire which put the office accommodation out of use for a period of about six months. Fortunately, although damaged by smoke and fumes, the records were saved almost intact, and with the goodwill of the staff and the willing assistance of other departments of the Council, temporary quarters were improvised almost at once. With a lapse of only two days the services of the department were again made available to the public. In May, another serious flooding incident occurred at Purley Corner with the attendant food spoilage and necessary cleansing operations to which we have become accustomed with this recurring problem. It is a relief to record therefore that with the Minister's decision on the new sewer becoming known towards the end of the year, we appear to be in sight of a permanent cure for this long standing nuisance. In concluding this introduction to the report, I should like to express my appreciation of the support given to me by the Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee, the friendly co-operation of Dr. J. B. Morwood, Medical Officer of Health, and the most willing assistance of all my colleagues in the department. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. HAWORTH, Chief Public Health Inspector. 30 HOUSING The following is a summary of work carried out in respect of the sanitary condition of dwelling houses during the year. 1.

Last year's report summarised the action that had been taken in pursuance of the Council's five year programme for dealing with unfit houses in the district, but only one of the remaining houses to be demolished was, in fact, cleared. One further house was represented as unfit and not capable of being made fit at a reasonable 32 cost and the Council purchased the property by agreement for the purpose of demolition. During the year a further check on properties of the type liable to action was carried out in response to Ministry Circular No. 2/60 and the Council propose to deal with a further 15 - 20 houses at the appropriate time. Housing repair work has followed the pattern of recent years but a feature of some significance in this respect has been the falling off in complaints by tenants, of disrepair and insanitary conditions in houses, compared with the early post war years when comparatively high figures were recorded. The generally dilapidated state of houses at that time was mainly the cause but the decrease in this type of complaint has been gradual for some years to a point when the number now recorded has reached a level little more than a tenth of the peak years. This situation lends point to the Minister's further appeal to encourage a greater interest in the improvement of houses lacking modern conveniences but otherwise in sound condition. During the year Discretionary Improvement Grants were made in respect of seven houses where improvement works were carried out to the total value of £2,204. Standard grants were also made in respect of the provision of "Standard amenities" in four houses to the value of £343. In all cases 50% grants were made. These numbers cannot be considered very satisfactory, particularly when it is disclosed that the houses in question were all owner-occupied. This confirms a trend that has been apparent for some time, at least in this district, that landlords owning rented cottage property do not appear to be interested in investing more money in this type of house. When the system of Standard Grants was introduced, an approach was made to a large property Company with a view to stimulating interest in the improvement of houses owned by the Company in the district, but this met with no response. This method of approach will be pursued in the light of the amendments made in the Housing Act, 1961, whereby the rent limit under the Rent Act, 1957 may be increased by 12½% of the amount expended on improvements by the landlord in lieu of the 8% formerly permitted. No action was taken during the year relating to the issue of Certificates of Disrepair under the provisions of the Rent Act, 1957. DRAINAGE During the year approximately 400 lineal yards of soil sewer were constructed by the Council to provide main drainage in respect of five houses in Firs Road, Kenley, and thus eliminate cesspool drainage at these properties. Five cesspools were abolished during the year. 33 The following is a summary of cesspool conversions carried out since 1950— Year Pail Closets (end of year) Cesspools (end of year) Houses and other premises connected to sewer Cesspools abolished 1950 17 180 19 houses 15 1 other 1951 14 153 30 houses 28 2 other 1952 11 144 10 houses 13 2 other 1953 11 134 10 houses 12 1954 11 136 3 houses 3 1 other 1955 11 117 21 houses 21 1 other 1956 6 106 10 houses 15 1 other 1957 6 101 4 houses 10 1 other 1958 6 94 6 houses 7 1959 6 95 — 1 1960 6 90 3 houses 7 2 other 1961 5 86 5 houses 5 PUBLIC CLEANSING This service is administered under the direction of the Engineer and Surveyor - Mr. H. M. Collins. A weekly collection of house refuse is in operation and trade refuse is collected concurrently as part of the daily routine in the five collection areas. There were no alterations in the methods of cesspool emptying or the collection and disposal of refuse during the year under consideration. House refuse is disposed of partly by incineration at Kenley Works and partly by means of controlled tipping. Cesspool contents are emptied into the sewer. During the year the Council continued to give urgent consideration to the problem of providing alternative tipping sites for the reception of house refuse. Charges are made for the removal of trade refuse and for cesspool emptying. 34 The scale of charges for cesspool emptying is now as follows:— (a) Existing cesspools at private properties erected before 1st April, 1958 — 10/- per load for the first 12 loads in any year and thereafter 15/- per load for all additional loads in the same year. (b) Cesspools constructed on or after 1st April, 1958 and before 31st March, 1959 at newly erected properties — a standard charge of 15/- per load. (c) Cesspools constructed on or after 1st April, 1959 at newly erected properties — a standard charge of 25/- per load. (d) Cesspools at commercial premises — 25/- per load. RIVERS AND STREAMS The only water courses in the District are those provided by the intermittent Bourne flows. These present no difficulties apart from occasional rat infestation along the banks. INSPECTION OF THE DISTRICT It is the statutory duty of a Public Health Inspector to inspect and have a thorough knowledge of the sanitary circumstances of his district in order that action can be taken if necessary to abate conditions that give rise to nuisance or are prejudicial to health. Over the years the character of this work has changed materially, reflecting the higher standards of living and nutrition that are now being enjoyed by the majority of the population. Gross nuisances and general insanitary conditions are the exception rather than the rule although occasionally houses occupied by old, infirm or mentally sick persons demand action to remedy such conditions. One such case is illustrated in this report but with the combined efforts of health, welfare and voluntary bodies, rehabilitation was successfully achieved. Under the following headings comment is made on particular aspects of the work, concluding with a summary of the complaints received, visits made, notices served, works carried out and defects remedied during the year. Camping Sites The Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960 confers on Local Authorities additional powers for the control of caravan sites and apart from improved planning powers it provides for a system of site licensing to be administered by district councils. 35 Site licences can only be issued if planning permission has been granted by the Planning Authority. Site operators in possession of planning permission cannot be refused a site licence which will remain valid for the period of planning permission subject to observance of the site licence conditions. In deciding what conditions to attach to a site licence a local authority must have regard to the Model Standards specified by the Minister. Provision is made for appeal against the conditions of a site licence and subject to this proviso penalties may be imposed for failure to comply with licence conditions. During the year a site licence was granted for a period of three years in respect of a single caravan in Caterham Drive, Old Coulsdon, and the licence in respect of a caravan in Hall & Company's Depot was renewed for a further year. In July, 1961, a local inquiry was held into the appeal by Dean Lane Park (Merstham) Ltd., against the grant of permission for the retention of the caravan site at Dean Lane Park for a period of three years, subject to conditions. The Minister of Housing and Local Government upheld the planning authorities' decision that the caravan use of the site should not be permitted to continue for more than three years and the appellant's submission that the site had existing use rights for caravans was not accepted. The Minister discharged certain conditions contained in the permission relating to a run down of the site but such conditions are included in the site licence. Later in the year, legal proceedings were instituted against Dean Lane Park (Merstham) Ltd., for non-compliance with a condition in the site licence requiring the maintenance of a site register giving the following particulars:— (i) The make and model of each caravan on the site together with its identification number and plot number or site address. (ii) Full name of occupier and owner of each caravan on the site [as recorded in (i)]. (iii) Date of departure of occupiers and removal of each caravan from the site (as recorded in (i) and (ii)]. The Company were fined £100 and 50 gns. costs. At the Hearing the defendants indicated their intention to appeal to the Divisional Court and the Magistrates' Court granted a stay of execution for three months. 36 Site licences in force at the present time are as follows :— Address No. of Caravans Period of Licence Dean Lane Park, Dean Lane, Merstham, 160 3 years from 21.12.60. Hall & Co., Depot, Marlpit Lane, Coulsdon. 1 1 year from 10.12.61. Windmill Farm, Coulsdon Common. 2 5 years from 29.12.60. Caterham Drive, Old Coulsdon. 1 3 years from 8.8.61. Site licence conditions in all cases require a water carriage system of drainage, main water supply and fire precautions. In the case of Dean Lane Park, communal ablution and laundry facilities with a constant supply of hot and cold water are additional requirements. Clean Air There has been no change in the policy of the Council regarding the formation of Smoke Control Areas. The district is not within the "Black Areas" around London as designated by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. The Council operate a Building Byelaw to provide for the installation in new buildings of appliances for heating or cooking which are suitably designed for burning smokeless fuels and in this respect invaluable work has been done in recent years by various interested bodies and appliance manufacturers to further the cause of a cleaner atmosphere by the use of approved appliances and smokeless fuel. With the current increased prosperity and consequent higher standards of living there is ample evidence that clean, labour saving means of space and hot water heating are very much in the minds of the householder and these trends, coupled with the National effort to form Smoke Control Areas in the worst affected districts are having a beneficial and permanent effect in the war against atmospheric pollution. As a further contribution to this campaign the Council have agreed on invitation, to participate in a National Survey of Air Pollution by Smoke and Sulphur Dioxide under the auspices of The Warren Spring Laboratory, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Under this scheme a number of Authorities, including a few in relatively non-polluted areas, have been invited either to start 37 taking measurements or to take measurements at new sites within their area. Stations for the purpose have been set up in the district at 73 Brighton Road, Purley and Selsdon Library, and particulars of measurements recorded will be available in due course. Apart from a few minor complaints no problem has arisen in connection with smoke nuisance during the year. There is little or no industrial smoke in the district. Hairdressing Establishments Byelaws are now in force in the district which provide for securing the cleanliness of premises and the instruments, towels, equipment and materials used in the premises. During the year 34 visits were made in pursuance of the byelaws. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952 Inspections are carried out, as necessary, to ensure that domestic heating appliances offered or exposed for sale are fitted with proper guards complying with standards prescribed in regulations made under the Act. Mines & Quarries Act, 1954 This Act requires compliance with provisions designed to prevent accidents arising through lack of proper fencing or too easy access. Routine visits are made to quarries in the district as necessary. Schools In co-operation with the Divisional Medical Officer and in the course of milk sampling, schools are visited from time to time. Shops Act As far as possible inspections have been made in respect of the provision and maintenance of sanitary accommodation, washing facilities, heating, lighting and ventilation in shops. By arrangement with the Engineer & Surveyor, the Department is given an opportunity of examining all plans submitted for the construction of new shops or alteration of existing premises, with a view to obtaining proper compliance with the requirements of the Act. This is generally appreciated by shop developers who are usually very willing to co-operate. The Council is also the Authority responsible for enforcement of the Shops Hours of Closing and Sunday Trading provisions of the Act and routine surveys and inspections are carried out for this purpose. 38 The Fabrics (Misdescription) Act, 1913 The Fabrics (Misdescription) Regulations 1959 The above mentioned Regulations prescribe standards of noninflammability for textile fabrics to which is attributed the quality of non-inflammability or safety from fire or any degree of that quality. The increased cost of fire resistant textile fabrics has so far restricted the demand for a product which if popularised would, no doubt, make a significant contribution to the cause of home safety. Radioactivity The Radioactive Substances Act, 1960 empowers the Minister concerned to require registration of undertakings keeping and using radioactive material and issue authorisations to dispose of radioactive waste. Provision is made for consultation with local authorities if it appears that the disposal of radioactive waste is likely to involve the need for special precautions to be taken by the local authority. This is in line with government policy to place the control of the sources of radioactivity with the central authority. During the year the department was consulted in connection with the disposal of a small quantity of radioactive waste from a local Research Establishment and the appropriate measures were taken. Disinfection and Disinfestation Disinfection is carried out when considered necessary following cases of infectious disease and otherwise on request and on payment of a small charge. Bedding and other clothing if possible is disinfected by arrangement with the Wandle Valley Hospital in a steam disinfector at the hospital. Sick rooms and other articles are disinfected by means of formaldehyde gas or spray, and library books are treated in a disinfecting chamber at the offices at 73, Brighton Road, Purley. 39 During 1961 the following disinfections were carried out:— Free of cost Upon Payment Total Loads of bedding, etc. 7 - 7 Houses disinfected 9 2 11 Parcels of clothing - 2 2 Library Books 10 - 10 Disinfestation work is now largely confined to the more common domestic pests such as flies, ants, cockroaches and wasps, although one case of bug infestation was dealt with during the year. School canteens were sprayed with a liquid insecticide to prevent fly infestation. The use of proprietary insecticides principally of the liquid variety and having a residual effect, is proving very effective in dealing with all types of insect pests. During the year 101 cases of infestation were dealt with by the department.

Compared with 1960 there was an increase in the number of complaints received and premises found to be infested by rats and mice. During the year the Department continued to carry out on a contract basis certain disinfestation work at agricultural premises formerly carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food. The Department does not, of course, rely solely on the receipt of complaints as an indication of infestation and routine inspections of dwelling houses, business premises including agricultural holdings, council owned properties and land are carried out from time to time and in conjunction with treatment on adjoining premises. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food continue to take an active interest in rodent control work carried out by local Authorities. Technical advice and instructional service through the regional and divisional pests staff is freely available and meetings of the No. 10, London Workable Area Committee of which this Authority is a member, are held from time to time to discuss with the Ministry's Officers, problems and new developments in connection with rodent control. It is the legal responsibility of the occupier of premises to keep the premises free from infestation by rats and mice, and in view of this the Council has maintained the principle that a small charge should be made in respect of destruction work carried out by the Council at private dwellings. A nominal charge of 5/- is made therefore for this service which is generally appreciated and in respect of which no serious difficulty has been experienced since it was first put into practice in 1951. Work carried out at business premises including agricultural holdings is charged at the full cost which, during 1961, was 11/9d. per hour plus cost of materials. A small scale test baiting in the sewerage system was carried out at points where small infestations had formerly occurred. Fifteen manholes were test baited with no evidence of rat infestation. A vertical block control treatment was also carried out in connection with a surface infestation but the 4 manholes tested gave negative results. For a number of years the department has relied principally on the use of Warfarin as a convenient and very effective poison for surface treatment, but on the advice of the Ministry its use has now been extended to sewer treatment by the addition of a preservative which inhibits mould growth in the poison. The Council has continued to undertake rodent control at local schools for The Surrey County Council on a contract basis. 44 RODENT CONTROL The following table is a tabular statement indicating the action taken in 1961. TABLE XIV Type of property Number of properties inspected by the Local Authority as a result of: Number of properties found to be infested by Number of treatments carried out by the Department by arrangement with occupier Number of Notices served under Section 4 Number of inspections made Notifica tion Otherwise Total Rats Mice Rats Mice Treatment Structural works, i.e. proofing Primary and reinspec tions Sewer treatment Total Local Authority 3 3 6 2 1 2 1 — — Dwelling Houses 263 22 285 229 50 182 44 — — Business Premises 47 16 63 35 11 35 11 — — 4,292 24 4,316 Agricultural 1 11 12 5 — 5 — — — Total 314 52 366 271 62 224 56 — — THE FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1960 These Regulations provide the Statutory authority to enforce reasonable standards of food hygiene in food premises and in respect of food handlers. Routine visits are made to all food premises with the object of maintaining these standards and reference to the tabular statement of works carried out will give some indication of the matters to which attention is directed. Guidance and advice in preference to legal sanction is the policy pursued in achieving the object, and in this respect the criticism of plans and other proposals for new and existing premises is of great assistance to architects and others affected. Codes of Practice relating to Poultry Dressing and Packing have been published during the year on behalf of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for the guidance of persons in these trades. The purpose behind the considerable efforts made on the subject of Food Hygiene is, of course, to ensure presentation of food to the consumer in a clean condition physically and bacteriologically and thus prevent so far as possible the considerable sickness that can be caused through contaminated food. In this respect it is encouraging to note from information circularised by the Ministry of Health covering a period of ten years, 1951-1960, that "general" outbreaks of food poisoning which occur in schools, canteens and other communal feeding establishments, have dropped appreciably over the period although "family" outbreaks have increased. It is suggested by the Ministry that this may reflect some good results of health education in public catering with room for improvement in the domestic sphere. During the year 28 complaints received in respect of contaminated or unsound food were fully investigated. Warning letters were sent in appropriate cases but in two instances it was felt that the circumstances necessitated legal proceedings. One case concerned a loaf of bread which contained a button. The firm concerned pleaded guilty and the Court imposed a fine of £50. with £8.8.0d. costs. In the second case, a baker was fined £15. and £12.12.0d. costs for selling an apple turnover in a mouldy condition. A variety of food samples, 128 in number, were submitted for bacteriological examination during the year, including synthetic and fresh cream, frozen and dried egg, cream cakes, minced beef, sausages, frozen meats and vegetables, potted shrimps, meat pies, fish cakes, crab meat and chicken vol-au-vent etc. The reports on these samples were generally very satisfactory. 46 During the year 90 swabs were taken from 451 items of washed crockery and submitted for bacteriological examination. Advisory work was carried out as and when necessary based on the reports received. Further details of food samples are recorded elsewhere in this report. The register of premises coming within the scope of the Food Hygiene Regulations at present includes the following:— Confectioners 59 Butchers 32 Fishmongers (wet and dry) 13 Fishmongers (fried) 5 Bakers 22 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 44 Cafes and Restaurants, 38 Grocers 77 Chemists 19 Licensed premises Hospitals, Nursing Homes, Guest Houses Hotels 21 Canteens, Clubs, Halls, etc 53 Schools 48 Twelve shops and one baker's premises are registered for the preparation of preserved meat, etc., and all the fish friers' premises are similarly registered in respect of fish frying. Milk. The Milk & Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959. Apart from small quantities bottled on the farms, milk sold in the larger Urban areas is collected in the distant producing areas and transported in bulk to large processing plants situate in the consuming centres where it is pasteurised or sterilised and bottled for sale by a comparatively few large dairy companies. Residents in this district rely in the main on these sources of supply, there being only one registered dairy now operating in the Council's area. General control by the Department is exercised under the above regulations and only pasteurised, tuberculin tested or sterilised milk can be sold in the district as a result of a Special Designations Order made in 1951. A further development has been noted in the sale of milk from bulk in catering establishments. Chilled milk dispensers are used to display and store the milk and care is required in ensuring that these containers are subjected to the necessary daily cleansing operation. A problem that still defies solution, in an industry that was never better organised both commercially and from a public health point of view, is that of the "misused" milk bottle. It is fair to say that every effort is made on the part of the industry to avoid the 47 possibility of bottles that have been misused getting back into circulation without proper cleansing, but occasionally a bottle evades detection and is the subject of complaint by the householder. The entries in the register, which has to be kept, were as follows:— Distributors of Milk in the District 17 Premises registered as Dairies 1 Under the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960, the following licences to sell milk were issued during the year. Dealer's Pre-packed Licences 24 Dealer's (Pasteuriser's) Licence 1 Dealer's (Tuberculine Tested) Licence 1 Under the Regulations, licences are valid for five years and will be renewable for subsequent quinquennial periods. A total of 191 samples of milk was submitted for bacteriological examination, with the results set out in the following table:— TESTS REQUIRED BY THE MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) REGULATIONS, 1960 TABLE XV Designation Number Methylene Blue Phosphatase T urbidity Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Pasteurised 139 124 14 void 1 failed 139 — — — T.T.

The results of the phosphatase test reflect the efficiency of modern pasteurisation. A total of 72 washed milk bottles was submitted for bacteriological examination with satisfactory results. 48 Ice Cream The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations, 1959 The manufacture of soft ice cream in small specially designed freezing machines that can be installed in sales vehicles and shops, is the latest development in this trade. Prospective users of these machines will, if inexperienced, require advice on the use, maintenance and cleansing of this type of equipment and consideration has been given by the department to the formation of a Code of Practice applicable to the handling of this commodity. One hundred and twenty premises are registered for the sale of ice cream within the district and although two premises are also registered for the manufacture of this product, no manufacturing has been carried out for some years. A total of 75 samples of ice cream was examined for bacterial quality by submission to the methylene blue reduction test, and placed in the following provisional grades :— Grade I 73 Grade II 1 Grade III — Grade IV 1 These results can be considered very satisfactory. Meat Slaughterhouses Act, 1958 Slaughter of Animals Act, 1958 Public Health (Meat) Regulations 1924-1955 With the closing of the slaughterhouse at Netherne Hospital, there are now no slaughtering facilities within the area of the Urban District and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has accepted the Council's view that there is no future need for such facilities in the district. Meat inspection is thus restricted to supplies in retail shops which are obtained in the main from the Croydon abattoir and Meat Market and the Smithfield Market. There are 32 butchers' shops in the District, all registered for the preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved meat under the provisions of Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955. Unsound Food The following is a list of foodstuffs including drink which after inspection were classified as unfit for human consumption. The quantities are in excess of a normal year as a result of the flooding incident in May, 1961. 49 With the exception of certain commodities that were released for reprocessing or excise purposes, the foodstuffs were destroyed at the Council's refuse destructor at Kenley. tons cwts. lbs.

Adverse reports were received on nine samples including one milk sample as follows Sample No. Nature of adulteration or irregularity Action taken Informal Sample No. 254 DEVONSHIRE DAIRY CREAM This was an informal sample taken in connection with an adverse report on a similar sample taken in 1960 and reported upon fully in that year. No further action. Formal Sample No. 266 COFFEE MILK CHOCOLATE CONTAINING IRISH WHISKY The Public Analyst did not consider that there was enough whisky present to warrant the description. Manufacturers agreed to alter the wording on the wrapper to read "Flavoured with genuine Old Irish Whisky". 50 Sample No. Nature of adulteration or irregularity Action taken Formal Sample No. 274 CUT OKRA AND TOMATOES Salt was not specified on the label as an ingredient as is required by the Labelling of Food Order. This was an American product and representatations were made with a view to amending the label. Formal Sample No. 302 READY MIX ICECREAM Inappropriate designation of one of the ingredients of this article specified on the label. Manufacturers agreed to use a new label. Formal Sample No. 312 MILK Milk solids other than milk fat 8.26 per cent. This sample was deficient in milk solids other than milk fat to the extent of 2.8 per cent, but the freezing point (Hortvet) of the sample did not indicate the presence of added water. This case was fully investigated and it was found that milk from certain producers as supplied to the dairy was well below the 8.5 per cent solids not fat standard although the average quality of the whole supply to the dairy was above the statutory standard. The dairy Company were requested to pay careful attention to bulking of supplies and representations were made to the Milk Marketing Board with a view to investigation at the farms in question. Formal Sample No. 319 FIGS This sample contained a live larva closely resembling that of the fig moth. Warning letter to Importers. Formal Samples Nos. 325/328 PURELEMON JUICE These samples from the same source contained 1 and 2 milligrams per 100 grams respectively of Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) compared with about 50 milligrams per 100 grams in fresh lemon juice. After consultation with the Chief Chemist of the Company concerned the latter decided to discontinue the marketing of Pure Lemon Juice. Formal Sample No. 335 PURE CALIFORNIAN LEMON JUICE (Canned) Deficiency in Vitamin C. On the advice of the Public Analyst a further sample of this product was obtained in an unopened can to avoid loss in Vitamin C, and the analysis proved satisfactory. 51 LIST OF SAMPLES TABLE XVI Article Analysed Non-Genuine Formal Informal Total Formal Informal Total Ale 1 - 1 - - - Apricots 1 — 1 — — — Beef Steaks 1 — 1 — — — Blackcurrants — 1 1 — — — Brandy 1 — 1 — — — Bread 2 — 2 — — — Butter (Peanut) 1 — 1 — — — Butter 1 — 1 — — — Buckwheat Mix — 1 1 — — — Cakes 1 1 2 — — — Candy Ice 1 — 1 — — — Confectionery 4 — 4 - — — Chocolate 2 — 2 1 — 1 Cornish Dairy Ice Cream 1 — 1 — — — Corned Beef — 1 1 - — — Coconut (desiccated) 1 — 1 — — — Coffee (Instant) 2 — 2 — — — Coffee (Ground) 2 — 2 — — — Cream 1 6 7 — 1 1 Condensed Milk 1 - 1 — — — Crab Meat — 1 1 — — — Curry 2 — — — — Dates 1 — 1 — — — "Dry Fry" — 1 1 — — — Evaporated Milk 1 — 1 — — — Figs 1 — 1 1 — 1 Fruit Salad (Dried) 1 — 1 — — — Fruit Salad 2 - — — — Foam Crystals 1 - 1 — - — Fruit Loaf 1 - 1 — — — Gin 2 - — — — Ginger (Crystalized) 1 - 1 — — — Glucose Beverage — 1 1 — — — Gravy 1 1 — — — Hamburger Steaks 1 - 1 — — — Honey 1 1 — — — Ice Cream (Ready Mix) 1 1 1 — 1 Jam 2 1 3 — — — Jelly — 1 1 — — — Juice (Carrot) — 1 1 — — — Kidneys (Braised) — 1 1 — — — Lamb Dinner 1 — 1 — — — Lancashire Hot Pot — 1 1 — — — Lemon Juice (Pure) 4 — 3 — 3 "Limmits" 1 — 1 — — — Lemonade Powder 1 — 1 — — — Luncheon Meat 1 — 1 — — — Marzipan de luxe — 1 1 — — — Mil 34 — 34 1 — 1 Mincemeat 1 — 1 — — — Minced Beef and Gravy — 1 1 — — — Minced Beef Loaf - 1 1 — — — Oil and Vinegar Dressing — 1 1 — — — Okra 1 — 1 1 — 1 Parkin Olde English 1 — 1 — — Total C/fwd. 87 23 110 8 1 9 52 A rticle A nalysed Non-Genuine Formal Informal Total Formal Informal Total Total B/fwd. 87 23 110 8 1 9 Pate de foie 1 — 1 — — — Peach Slices in Syrup ... — 1 1 — — ....
