DAVIS (Assistant to Disinfector.) E. FIFE and R. C. FAIRHURST (Rodent Operatives) 7 To the Chairman and Members of the Chislehurst and Sidcup Urban District Council. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, The word " change " which has a surprisingly large number of dictionary definitions can for the purposes of this letter be considered as either a change for the better or a change for the worse. My mind is working on these lines for this happens to be the twenty-fifth annual report since this district came into existence in 1934, and it seems a suitable time to give some thought to the changes which have taken place in the interim. The most important feature is that the changes for the better considerably outnumber those for the worse, and therefore we can look back with a sense of satisfaction to the last quarter of a century even though that period includes six years of the most devastating war of all time. Between 1934 and the present day, the local infant mortality rate has been reduced from 46 per thousand live births to 20 9 per thousand live births, the population has just about doubled itself, and the death and birth rates have remained fairly steady. While dealing with figures, one of the more outstanding features is found in the returns of infectious diseases, and the following short table speaks for itself in a way that no words of mine could possibly do. Disease. No. of cases. No. entered Hospital. No. of deaths. Scarlet Fever 1934 — 132 1934 — 109 1934 — 1 1958 — 89 1958 — 25 1958 — Nil Diphtheria 1934 — 24 1934 — 22 1934 — 3 1958 — Nil 1958 — Nil 1958 — Nil In addition, in the earlier years there were 23 deaths from tuberculosis and three from whooping cough by comparison with 10 and nil respectively in 1958. Thus the picture has changed vastly from that of 1934—a year which is well within the memory of a large number of those who will read this report. Having indicated some of the brighter features, it is now time to turn to the darker side of the picture and in this connection, I should like to refer particularly to cancer and bronchitis. In 1934 fifty-six deaths were ascribed to cancer and six to bronchitis which figures had altered to 156 and 44 respectively in 1958—a really significant alteration even after taking into consideration the increase in population. On the subject of cancer it is very desirable to point out that the total figure of deaths from this cause include no fewer than 41 deaths from lung cancer. It is impossible to compare this latter figure with 1934 as at that period lung cancer caused comparatively few deaths, and separate 8 figures for the mortality arising therefrom are not available. However the condition has now reached epidemic proportions and the accumulated statistical evidence is such that there now appears to be no other reasonable interpretation of the figures other than a cause and effect relationship between smoking and many cases of lung cancer. Smoking of cigarettes would appear to be the most dangerous form of tobacco consumption, but despite the fact that this knowledge must now be very well known to the great mass of the population, the consumption of tobacco continues to increase and vast numbers of our people are prepared to face the risks of smoking rather than suffer the pangs of deprivation. One is rather fearful of the ultimate results of this heedlessness on the part of the community at large, and would like to suggest some remedy, but feel that the only way in which a satisfactory conclusion can be reached is by precept. It is very well known that the adolescent in his or her anxiety to prove their maturity will always follow the example of the adult, especially when that example is a bad one ! It therefore seems to me to follow that until adults are prepared to show the way to the youth of the country we are likely to have an ever increasing incidence of lung cancer with its very high mortality rate. In a very estimable attempt to cut the number of deaths from this disease by early diagnosis and treatment, the South-East Metropolitan Regional Board's Mass X-ray units are undertaking a regular six monthly chest x-ray examination of men volunteers over the age of 45, but how much more satisfactory it would be if such a service were unnecessary. The other disease to which I wished to make special reference was what is known as the English Disease or bronchitis. Not only has the death rate from this condition increased alarmingly, but there is also undoubtedly an enormous amount of invalidism caused by a condition which is most distressing to its victims. In this case it is probable that pollution of the atmosphere we breathe is a main contributory cause of the condition, and here again it is probable that smoking makes its contribution. However any effort however small towards making the air pure is welcome, and one hopes that the local authority will make its effort in the common cause through the Clean Air Act and its smoke control area provisions. Experience gained with the use of vaccination against anterior poliomyelitis indicates the development of a high degree of immunity, and it is therefore hoped that all who are at present eligible for this form of preventive treatment, will take advantage of it at the earliest possible opportunity. It is also hoped that it will not be long before all who wish to be immunised against this 9 disease will be able to obtain the necessary injections irrespective of age. If prudent forethought is given to this disease and its control and such advice applies to all diseases for which there are known preventive measures, for example, diphtheria, a great deal of worry and anxiety could be avoided in the event of a sudden outbreak of one of these diseases. A matter of great importance to the Health Committee was the fact that during the year, the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London invited the Council to make a statement on certain services operating within its boundaries. This invitation was accepted and although some considerable time is bound to elapse before the Royal Commission's proposals can be known, they will certainly be of great interest to the Health Committee who would I feel, welcome any additional responsibilities should they be forthcoming. Before concluding I should like to express my sincere gratitude to Mr. Kermode, the Chief Public Health Inspector, who has worked so efficiently in a very busy year, also to all members of the staff of the department my most grateful thanks. My deputy Dr. Kelynack has been most loyal and helpful and I am greatly indebted to him and a whole host of medical practitioners, outside the confines of the Public Health Department, who have been so courteous and co-operative. As usual my very last word of thanks must be to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee who, in a year of considerable activity, have shown a lively interest in the endeavours of the department to serve the community to the best of their ability. I am, Your obedient Servant, H. B. C. CARTER-LOCKE, Medical Officer of Health. SECTION A. VITAL AND OTHER STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA. 12 SECTION A.

The Registrar General's estimate of the total population of the Urban District, mid year 1958, was 88,540 which shows an increase of 750 over the figure for the previous year. The population figure gives a density of 9-9 persons to the acre. The natural increase of population, measured by excess of births over deaths was 586. This increase continues the healthy trend noted in previous years, which is illustrated in the following figures showing the growth of the population during the last decade. Year. Population. 1949 73,850 1950 80,040 1951 85,150 1952 85,130 1953 85,290 1954 85,830 1955 86,870 1956 87,300 1957 87,790 1958 88,540 BIRTHS. The birth rate for the year 1958, was 15.2 per 1,000 total population, the adjusted rate for comparison with other areas being 14.7. The rate of 15.2 is 1.2 higher than that for 1957, but is lower than the rate of 16.4 for England and Wales as a whole. One thousand, three hundred and forty-two live births were registered in the Urban District during the year, as against 1,227 in 1957. The illegitimate birth rate was 40.9 per 1,000 live and still births, there being 54 illegitimate live births, 32 of which were males and 22 females. Twenty-seven stillbirths were registered, giving a rate of 0.3 per 1,000 estimated total population and 19.72 per 1,000 live and still births. Twelve of the stillbirths were males and 15 females. DEATHS. Seven hundred and fifty-six deaths appertaining to the Urban District were registered during 1958, giving a Death rate of 8.5 per 1,000 total population. The adjusted rate for use when comparing one area with another is 11 1. The rate for England and Wales as a whole is 11.7. 15 Of the deaths registered, 402 were males and 354 females. The following is an analysis of the ages at death:— Male. Female. Total. Under 1 year of age 16 12 28 1 and under 15 years of age 7 1 8 15 and under 25 years of age 6 4 10 25 and under 45 years of age 17 12 29 45 and under 65 years of age 123 71 194 65 and under 75 years of age 97 77 174 75 years of age and over 136 177 313 402 354 756 Full details of the causes of death will be found in Table II in the appendix but the following figures may be of interest:— 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 Cancer (all sites) 102 131 132 127 154 149 157 127 151 156 Respiratory Diseases (not T.B.) 55 59 89 72 80 73 87 88 99 96 Tuberculosis 35 30 30 22 20 14 7 11 8 10 Heart and Circulatory Diseases 257 330 361 377 325 320 353 329 348 356 Infectious Diseases 15 8 4 4 3 2 2 2 — 1 Road Traffic Accidents 7 5 6 4 9 5 5 8 8 8 Other violent causes 11 12 12 10 7 9 10 11 13 13 Cancer of the Lung and Bronchus * 31 22 21 38 36 44 31 34 41 (* No figures available. Separate records commenced in 1950) Deaths from the major causes remained almost unchanged compared with the previous year, with the single exception of those due to lung cancer, which increased from 34 to 41. The problems posed by this disease are referred to in my introductory letter. A satisfactory feature of the figures has again been the small number of deaths due to tuberculosis and other infectious diseases, and that there were no deaths from poliomyelitis. LOCAL SICKNESS. The following is a summary of the weekly details received from the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance during 1958:— Four weeks ending Number of First Certificates of incapacity received. 28th January 1,509 25th February 1,082 25th March 1,012 22nd April 833 20th May 666 17th June 508 15th July 504 12th August 433 9th September 543 7th October 625 4th November 887 2nd December 1,026 30th December 720 16 The above figures followed the expected trend, namely, the highest incidence of illness occurred during January and February, the lowest level was reached in August, after which it began to rise again. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS. Thirty-nine members, or potential members of the staff were medically examined during the year. UNEMPLOYMENT. I am indebted to the Manager of the Local Employment Exchange for the following information with regard to unemployment in the area during 1958 :— " There was a slight increase in unemployment throughout 1958, but taking into consideration the population, the numbers have been very small, with an average of 350. Local firms continue to hold their own, and the unemployment comes to a large extent from firms out of the district." OPEN AIR RECREATIONAL AMENITIES. Location. Acreage. Description.

Some of these provide quiet, unspoilt ramblage, some are well laid out Parks with the usual amenities, and the rest consist of sports fields. Provision is thus made for all sections of the community and the general health of the populace is thereby benefited. 18 This area does not include the Commons at Chislehurst and St. Paul's Cray, nor land under the control of the National Trust, which was recently increased by the gift of a tract of woodland originally part of the Hawkwood Estate, Chislehurst. The district is well provided with open spaces of many kinds. They vary from the orchard lands of the Green Belt, woodland of the Commons at Chislehurst and St. Paul's Cray, to the numerous games pitches and well kept Parks throughout the area. Improvement to parks and open spaces continues, the principal advancement during the year again being related to Hoblingwell Wood, St. Paul's Cray, where drainage has been completed, as has sowing of the remaining two terraces. The popularity of the Games Warden Scheme has led to its extension to include no fewer than five of the Council's Parks. Wardens are now installed for the summer holiday period at Marlborough Park, Penhill Park, Sidcup Place, Mottingham Sports Ground and Hoblingwell Wood. This facility has given rise to a greater use of the Parks and to a better standard of behaviour amongst the growing children. SECTION B. GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA. 20 SECTION B. GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA. DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION. The Department is responsible for disinfection of premises, etc., after the removal of persons suffering from infectious complaints, or subsequent to the patient being declared free from infection. Infected bedding and clothing are subjected to steam under pressure at the disinfecting station situated in Main Road, Sidcup. Rooms, fixtures, and furnishings are sprayed with formalin. Public Library books which have been exposed to infection are rendered safe and returned to the libraries concerned. Disinfestation work in connection with the eradication of vermin in premises is also undertaken by the Department. Rooms are treated with a solution containing a quick acting insecticide as well as D.D.T. Bedding is subjected to steam treatment, in order to destroy eggs, etc. Advice is given to householders and others to assist them in dealing with the various insect infestations. It is an interesting commentary on the progress of medical science, the advance in health education and on the efficacy of modern insecticides and techniques that the use of these services is on a decreasing scale. Details of the work carried out during 1958 are as under :— DISINFECTIONS. Premises visited 312 Rooms disinfected 59 Articles disinfected 585 DISINFESTATIONS.

Recreation Ground, Mottingham. Sidcup Place, Sidcup. A staff of two part-time and three whole-time cleaners is employed on this work. During the year the new conveniences at Dorset Road, Mottingham, and the rebuilt block at the Lansdown Road entrance to Waring Park, Sidcup, were opened. 22 The Public Health Committee is conscious of the importance of this service and is anxious to take all steps possible to ensure that full facilities are available to the public. With this in mind, a decision was made to demolish the small building serving the High Street, Sidcup area and to provide a convenience worthy of this important shopping centre. The Committee were greatly perturbed to learn of the vast amount of damage, of a malicious nature, which was being caused at conveniences throughout the district. The great majority of this was due to hooliganism, and could not have been perpetrated, with any benefit in mind, to those concerned. Particular centres of damage included the two conveniences at St. Paul's Cray, that in the Recreation Ground at Mottingham, and the large building at Westwood Lane, Sidcup. A Sub-Committee carried out an exhaustive investigation into the position and made certain recommendations. Among those of a short-term nature were the locking of most of the buildings during the night and the issue of warnings in which the co-operation of the Press must be acknowledged. The position was much helped by a successful prosecution of two youths who were apprehended whilst damaging a wash basin. As a long term policy it was decided to instal attendants at certain conveniences during 1959. Thus Westwood Lane, which had been constructed with accommodation for staff, will be dealt with first, whilst additions will be built at Cotmandene Crescent, St. Paul's Cray, to provide rooms for attendants. The new conveniences at St. John's Road, Sidcup are being designed on a similar basis. Hot water washing facilities, so necessary for proper hygiene, will be available at these three buildings. LABORATORY SERVICE. In the detection and control of food poisoning, dysentery and the enteric fevers, the Laboratory Service is of great importance. Most medical specimens are sent to the Public Health Laboratory at Maidstone, and the co-operation of Dr. J. H. C. Walker, the Director, is willingly given. In cases of urgency, specimens are examined at the Bromley Hospital Laboratory, and I am again indebted to Dr. Keall and his staff for this assistance. Through the courtesy of Dr. Randall of Orpington Hospital, copies of numerous reports on specimens submitted by local practitioners, were also made available to me. 23 During the course of the year, the following specimens have been submitted for examination:— Food Faeces Vomit Others No. sent No. Positive No. sent No. Positive No. sent No. Positive No. sent No. Positive Bromley Hospital — — 3 — — — Maidstone Public Health Laboratory 1 - 46 3 - - — — Orpington Hospital — - 6 — — - - - Totals 1 — 55 3 — — — - The number of specimens of food, vomit and faeces sent for examination shows a decrease, although it should be understood that a single outbreak of an infection of intestinal origin, might considerably alter these figures. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948. Section 47. Fortunately, it has not been necessary to apply to the Court for an Order for compulsory removal of any person in need of care and attention and unable to provide for themselves. Nevertheless, a number of cases have been investigated. This work is of humane interest and all steps possible are taken, in conjunction with other Authorities, friends and relations to make the lot of these old persons happier. It is pleasing to be able to report that this is often achieved. Section 50. This section of the Act places a duty on the local authority to arrange for the burial or cremation of the body of any person who had died, or been found dead in their area, if it appears that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have, or are being, made. Expenses incurred by the local authority may be recovered from the estate of the deceased person, or from any person liable to maintain the deceased person, immediately prior to his death. Investigations were made after several deaths, but in only one instance was it necessary to arrange for burial. 24 PUBLIC MORTUARY. Quite a proportion of the time of the Chief Disinfector and his assistant is taken up by duties at the Public Mortuary. The reception and treatment of bodies, the arrangements which have to be made in connection with Post Mortem examinations, and the emergency calls which are apt to be made in connection with this service, all call for unusual qualities. The Mortuary which contains refrigerated accommodation for six bodies has been redecorated and provided with more efficient heating during the year. Further additions and improvements to equipment will be put in hand in 1959. The number of bodies received into the Mortuary during the year was 182, of which 83 came from hospitals. Inquests were held in 37 cases. HOSPITAL SERVICES. Cray Valley Hospital.

SERVICES RENDERED BY VOLUNTARY AGENCIES. British Red Cross Society. Six Detachments in the Chislehurst and Sidcup Division continue to operate wholly or partially within the Urban District. The Divisional Director, Mrs. A. Harvey, and the Secretary, Mrs. E. M. Watling, operate from Headquarters at Hornbrook House, High Street, Chislehurst. 30 Members of the Society give service to the public by rendering first aid, especially from the Road Hut on the Sidcup By-Pass at Ruxley Corner which is manned on Sundays and Bank Holidays. Auxiliary nursing is undertaken at hospitals and invalids are escorted over long journeys. In the home, assistance is given to the sick and aged and diversional therapy is provided. A Foot Clinic has now been established in Sidcup for Old Age Pensioners, and anyone requiring this service may contact Mrs. I. Evans, 26, St. Johns Road, Sidcup, for an appointment. A store of sick room equipment is maintained and can be borrowed for a small charge from Hornbrook House, High Street, Chislehurst, on: Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays 3 p.m. — 4 p.m. Thursdays 11 a.m. — 12 noon Fridays 12 noon — 1 p.m. Saturdays 9 a.m. — 10 a.m. A Sub-Depot is also open at 34, Crescent Road, Sidcup. The "Good Samaritan Club" for disabled men and women meets at Hornbrook House, on the second and fourth Fridays in each month at 2.30 p.m. Handicraft classes for the disabled are also held at Hornbrook House on Tuesdays, from 10 a.m. to 11.45 a.m. and at the Clinic, St. Paul's Cray, on each Wednesday at 10 a.m.—12 noon. The St. John Ambulance Brigade. The St. John Ambulance Brigade functions within the Urban District under the Divisional Superintendent, Mrs. Barton, and the Divisional Secretary is Mr. H. R. Haley. Personnel with first aid qualifications attend many public gatherings, including local cinemas and meetings of the Old Age Pensioners Associations. Training in first aid and home nursing is offered to members of the public. First Aid is rendered in case of road accidents by staff stationed at the Road Hut on the Sidcup By-Pass in the Longlands Area. Through the Division's Medical Comforts Fund, bath chairs, rubber sheeting, etc., may be hired for a nominal fee. Application for these may be made at the Drill Hall, Halfway Street, Sidcup, on Tuesdays at 8—10 p.m. and at other times by telephoning FOOtscray 7444. 31 Women's Voluntary Service. Valuable facilities continue to be placed at the disposal of the public through the W.V.S. from its offices at Craybrooke House, Sidcup Hill, Sidcup. Hospital work—Chislehurst and Sidcup W.V.S. members have done a considerable amount of escorting of elderly people to and from hospital. Assistance is given daily in the Out-patients department of Queen Mary's Hospital. The Trolley Shop at Cray Valley Hospital appears to be more and more appreciated. From a very small beginning, it has now become a regular feature which is looked for by the patients. General Welfare Work—The W.V.S. members visit the old people in their homes, doing shopping, etc., for them. Wheel chairs continue to be loaned. W.V.S. members hold an annual luncheon party for old people which, in 1958, took place in April. The W.V.S. is exploring the possibility of starting a Meals-onWheels service in the district. The main problem, as always, is procuring a kitchen and transport. CHISLEHURST AND SIDCUP OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE COMMITTEE. The following is a brief resume of the work carried out by the Committee:— The Committee now have twelve clubs very firmly established and club day is looked forward to with ever increasing pleasure. The Friendly Club, which was re-opened last year, is now thoroughly launched. "Rediac," Station Road, Sidcup. The original ten tenants still occupy their flatlet homes. During the year, heating was installed in two of the three bathrooms. Boarding-Out Scheme. More than fifty elderly people have now been found homes in North-West Kent. The Committee is always delighted to hear of any possible offers of accommodation. Visiting. This service does not gather much strength and the Committee still feel there are many lonely people in the district with whom they fail to make contact and they ask all churches, doctors and social workers to help in this matter. SECTION C. SANITARY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. 34 SECTION C. SANITARY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. AGRICULTURE (SAFETY, HEALTH AND WELFARE PROVISIONS) ACT, 1956. This Act places on local authorities the duty of securing the provision and maintenance of sanitary accommodation for the use of employees on agricultural holdings. The number of agricultural holdings within the district, which come under the terms of this Act, is limited. Thirty visits have been paid in connection with the requirements of the Act. CESSPOOLS. Three new cesspools have been installed during the year, all for private dwellings, where access to a sewer is not possible. Four cesspools have been abolished. There are now 399 premises not connected to main drainage. Premises. Cesspools. Lamorbey and Blackfen 6 6 Sidcup and Footscray 7 7 North Cray 227 182 St. Paul's Cray 77 49 Chislehurst and Mottingham 82 71 399 315 In a number of cases two or more properties drain to one cesspool. There are also several premises provided with small sewage disposal plants and a few using chemical or earth closets. The total number of cesspools in use in the district is now 315. It has not been possible during the year to institute any scheme of sewerage designed to accommodate houses not at present on main drainage, but active consideration is being given to the laying of sewers in roadways adjacent to Leesons Hill, St. Paul's Cray, and for a small block of houses on Sevenoaks Way, St. Paul's Cray. The Council's cesspool emptying service, instituted in 1954, allows owners to have their cesspools emptied promptly and at a moderate charge. Although not taken advantage of by all persons concerned, it has undoubtedly been a factor in the prevention of nuisances occurring from overflow of effluent. 35 The following table shows the use made of the service during the year.

DISEASES OF ANIMALS (WASTE FOODS) ORDER, 1957. The work of licencing and controlling plants for boiling waste food was delegated by the Kent County Council during 1957. It is principally designed to prevent disease in animals fed on swill. Visits have been paid to ten plants known to exist in the district. It was found that six of them fell within the licencing provisions of the Order, and accordingly licences were issued. Opportunity was taken to make some improvements and three faults were remedied. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. I am informed by the Engineer and Surveyor that new lengths of sewer have been completed, or adopted in private estate development as follow:— Foul Sewers of 6" and 9" diameters, totalling 170 yds. Surface Water Sewers of 9", 12" and 18" diameters, totalling 620 yds. In addition the Council completed in repairs and modification of existing sewers, the replacement of lengths of new pipes:— Foul Sewers 6", 9", 12" and 24" diameters, totalling 148 yds. Surface Water Sewers 9" and 24" diameters, totalling 51 yds. FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 AND 1948. Public Health Inspectors have made 266 visits of inspection to factories, with and without mechanical power, and to building sites, etc., which are controlled by these Acts. 19 nuisances or defects were dealt with, some in conjunction with H.M. Inspector of Factories. 36 The following is a copy of the return supplied to the Ministry of Labour and National Service in respect of the year 1958:— 1.

During the year four licences to deal in Game were issued to local firms. HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952. Fifteen visits were paid to various shops, etc., where oil, electric, or gas heating apparatus is sold. Observations did not reveal contraventions of the Act, and it would appear that 37 manufacturers are adhering strictly to the requirements laid down, with a view to the prevention of fire danger, although accidents caused by fires in the home are known to be all too prevalent. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. Licences to sell pet animals were issued to proprietors of six premises. Supervision of these shops entailed 30 visits and it was found that the sale of pets was on a comparatively small scale; no contraventions were detected. PETROLEUM (REGULATION) ACTS, 1928 AND 1936. Mr. J. C. Kermode, Chief Public Health Inspector, is the Inspector appointed under the above Acts. Petroleum spirit and/or petroleum mixtures are stored at 62 premises, under licence. The total capacity is as follows:— Petroleum spirit in tanks 140,900 gallons. Petroleum mixture in tanks 9,660 gallons. Petroleum spirit in canned stores 200 gallons. Petroleum mixture in canned stores 150 gallons. Petroleum spirit and mixture in approved stores 2,100 gallons. Carbide of calcium 100 lbs. The amount of petroleum spirit kept in the district is being increased, mainly due to the provision of additional storage at existing licensed premises. The Home Office model code of Principles of construction and licencing conditions for storage of petroleum spirit and mixtures, has been incorporated into the licences issued in respect of all installations. The principal new requirement deals with the testing of ageing underground storage tanks and pipe lines. This work involves considerable preparation and is now proceeding. PUBLIC CLEANSING, REFUSE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL. I am indebted to the Cleansing, Transport and Salvage Officer for the following information. The volume of refuse is still increasing and this is in line with the general trend throughout the country, due in a large measure to the increased use of electricity and oil for heating. This trend demands changes in our transport requirements which means vehicles of larger capacity with some degree of packing in order to maintain schedules. 38 The number of premises cleared was in the region of 27,500 and as some of these buildings, particularly the large ones, use more than one bin, the number of journeys made by the collectors is substantial. It is estimated that 1,526,000 calls were made last year. In addition to dealing with special accumulations from trade premises, arrangements are in force for this service to be provided to individual householders. A charge is made, based on the actual costs of the job plus the usual oncosts. Whilst the volume of work involved is not great it does provide a useful outlet to people who have extra debris or refuse for disposal, and is appreciated. All night burning stoves are obviously used to a large extent and these bring added dangers from fire, owing to hot ashes being placed in the bin. The weight of refuse collected was in the region of 25,549 tons. A further 4,000 tons was received at the tip in the form of trade refuse, gully contents, street sweepings, trimmings from verges, etc. Kitchen waste amounted to 376 tons, and was cleared chiefly from individual containers in the Mottingham and Lamorbey areas and certain schools. About 3,000 containers are in use. Disposal of the refuse was carried out at St. Paul's Cray Hill Park, where low lying ground is being reclaimed. Tipping at the Baugh Estate was completed and the land has now been handed over to the Parks Committee. Further vehicles and trailers of improved design, fitted with diesel engines have been purchased. Salvage including waste paper, has been maintained at a high level in spite of market difficulties. The demand for newspaper has fallen, but cardboard and mixed papers are in keen demand. Trade Refuse. As there appears to be some misunderstanding regarding the clearance of this material, it is perhaps desirable to make the position clear. The removal of Trade Refuse can only be undertaken by the department providing payment is made in accordance with the scale of charges laid down by the Council in order to comply with the provisions of the Public Health Act. Bulk Container System. The Bulk Container System was introduced to deal with refuse from flats, hospitals, hotels and other similar places in the district. 39 Some of the main advantages are as follow:— 1. Improved storage. 2. The containers are emptied hydraulically, and the operation is dustless. 3. The containers cannot be interfered with by dogs or cats. 4. Where the volume of refuse is substantial it does away with the need for a large number of bins, which can look untidy and, take up a lot of room. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951. There are no premises in the district licensed under the Rag Flock Act. RIDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACT, 1939. Four establishments from which horses are hired out for the purpose of riding have been kept under observation. One of these closed during the year. The animals, consisting of 39 horses and 34 ponies were inspected by the Veterinary Surgeon appointed for the purpose. Three visits were made and the animals were reported to be in good health. The Inspectors paid a further 45 visits. Improvements to stables have been carried out where necessary. RIVERS AND STREAMS. The Engineer and Surveyor informs me that apart from the normal maintenance of streams and of those sections of rivers not coming under the jurisdiction of the Kent River Board, only minor works of repair to banks and retaining walls have been necessary during 1958. As in the past, close vigilance is kept on a number of localities where the risk of flooding is known. For instance, wherever a river or stream flows through open ground, that is not within private land, a regular patrol clears the watercourse and its banks of debris likely to cause obstructions; and immediately on the threat of rain, the points where water-courses enter the culverts under public highways are watched until the risk of flooding is past. During the very wet Summer and Autumn of 1958, flooding from rivers and streams was thus prevented, except on Friday, 22nd August, and of course, Friday, 5th September, when the peak intensities of rainfall were 2 inches and 6 inches respectively. The precaution of patrolling streams in open ground and the policy of "call and clear" at potential danger spots will be continued. 40 Considerable attention has been given by this Department to the eradication of rats, which nest in the banks of the streams, as it is considered that such settlements might serve as a "reservoir" for vermin which may then infest adjoining properties. Close watch is kept on the streams for signs of pollution and a total of 159 visits have been made to rivers and streams. FLOODING. The year was exceptional from the point of view of periods of intense rainfall. The Engineer and Surveyor informs me that as late as Easter, there was a fairly heavy fall of snow, and a rapid thaw followed by rain caused flooding in gardens, in private secondary accesses, in undrained footpaths and even in a number of streets where the sewers were surcharged. The rain gauge recorded 1.37 inches in 24 hours. For the remainder of the year, rainfall exceeded half an inch on the following dates:— 3rd June 0.75 ins. 10th June 0.74 ins. 11th June 0.56 ins. 27th June 1.40 ins. 20th July 0.51 ins. 12th August 1.02 ins. 22nd August 1.10 ins. 25th August 0.67 ins. (between 2.0 and 2.35 p.m.) 28th August 0.67 ins. 20th September 0.86 ins. 5th September 3.5 ins. (between 7.30 and 10.0 p.m.) 21st September 0.51 ins. 24th September 0.70 ins. 18th October 0.76 ins. 2nd November 1.39 ins. In certain low lying districts flooding from surface water occurred especially during the night of 5th September. Some of this was contaminated by sewage and found its way into buildings, flooding the sub-floor spaces. In conjunction with the Engineer and Surveyor such emergency measures as were possible were put in hand. Drains and sewers, choked with silt or damaged, were freed and slaked lime was distributed to those who had suffered from flooding, for use as a disinfectant and de-odorant. It was found that householders rapidly set about the work of clearing away debris and drying out premises and furnishings. In a few cases an objectionable smell developed which could not be removed by the limited scattering of lime in the sub-floor space. In eleven instances floor boards were lifted and the sub-floor concrete treated with a mixture containing chloride of lime, by the Engineer's staff, under the direction of the Public Health Inspectors. 41 A special section of the Engineer and Surveyor's Department has now been set up to deal with the question of drainage and possible overloading of the sewerage system. In a few shops the contaminated flood water affected foodstuff and it was necessary to withdraw from sale items totalling 16 cwts. 1 qtr. 25 lbs. RODENT CONTROL. Two Rodent Operatives have been employed during the year. It is interesting to note that the total number of treatments and retreatments necessary shows a decrease of 101 when compared with 1957. There has been unquestionably, a lowering of the incidence of rat infestation in the district. This may be due to a number of causes, including more intensive treatment and use of better techniques and poisons. Some alteration in natural cycle of the pests may also have played its part. The following is a summary of the work carried out during the year:— TYPE OF PROPERTY (1) Local Authority (2) Dwellings (including Council Houses) (3) Others Business (inc. L.A.

The use of this preparation with a longer period of baiting has been continued in 1958 and again the results are most gratifying. Sections of sewers, known to have been used persistently by the rats for years, have now been cleared. The last treatment carried out in 1958, was most encouraging although the heavy flooding of some sewers two months previously may also have made them temporarily untenable for rats. Particulars of treatment are given below:— Number of Manholes treated No. of manholes in which "Complete takes" "Partial takes" "No takes" Test bait 194 18 22 154 1st Maintenance treatment (April) 207 24 40 143 2nd Maintenance treatment (Oct.) 242 0 4 238 SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA. Full details of the work carried out by the Inspectors will be found in Table VI in the appendix. The following is a summary of the totals under the respective headings:— Total number of Inspections and Visits. Housing 6,799 Infectious Diseases 376 Food Premises, Sampling, etc. 3,308 Factories, Outworkers, etc. 272 Moveable Dwellings 570 Smoke Abatement and Shops Act 486 Rodent Control 1,443 Public Conveniences 879 Miscellaneous 733 14,866 Written Notices issued:— Preliminary: General Sanitary Defects 287 Food Premises 63 Shop Premises 11 Factories, etc. 5 Rodent Control 21 Statutory: Public Health Act 6 (one subsequently withdrawn) Housing Act 1 43 SHOPS ACT, 1950. The number of shops within the meaning of the Act, existing at the 31st December, 1958, was 850. They are situated as follow:— Lamorbey and Blackfen 260 Sidcup and Footscray 286 North Cray and St. Paul's Cray 100 Chislehurst and Mottingham 204 850 Only a few new shops have been opened in the area during the year, but considerable modernisation, often of a structural nature is being carried out to individual premises. Where possible shopkeepers are encouraged to incorporate a better standard of amenities for their employees in such premises. There is evidence that in a few cases shops permitted to open in the afternoon of the early closing day, or on Sundays for trade in certain commodities have been selling other articles. Warnings have been issued where necessary. No Closing Orders have been made in the district. The general closing days vary throughout the area and are as follow : Wednesday—St. Paul's Cray Estate (except Leith Hill), Chislehurst, The Oval, Lamorbey, Lewis Road, Sidcup. Thursday—Sidcup area, other than above. A few shops open on the usual early closing day and remain closed on Saturday afternoon. Again the Council decided to use its powers to suspend the general closing hours of shops prior to Christmas. Visits and observations total 360. The following infringements of the Act have been dealt with. Offences Found. Remedied. Notices and records 27 28 Hours of work 4 3 Sanitary accommodation (defective & insufficient) 25 24 Washing accommodation (defective & insufficient) 12 12 Closing 2 1 Ventilation 2 2 Temperature 7 6 Sunday trading 5 5 Seats for female assistants 2 2 Other matters 3 3 CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956—SMOKE CONTROL AREAS. A special Sub-Committee of the Council was formed to give consideration to the formation of Smoke Control Areas in this district. Within such areas it would become an offence to produce 44 smoke and to obviate this, it would be necessary to burn one of the smokeless types of fuel for which special grates would need to be installed. The Council was not, during the year, able to recommend any part of the district as an initial area and deferred further consideration until assurance could be obtained with regard to the availability of the right type of fuel. Pollution Gauges. In July, a volumetric apparatus for measuring air pollution was installed at the Public Health Department's office at the Manor House, and this measures, day by day the extent of the tarry matter in a sample of air and the quantity of the gas, sulphur dioxide, contained in it. The apparatus indicated a comparative absence of either of these pollutants during the summer months, but in still conditions especially when fog was seen to be forming, the gauge recorded a seventy-fold increase both in soot and sulphur dioxide. The accompanying graph shows the readings obtained. Graphs are also reproduced showing results obtained from the Deposit Gauges and Sulphur Dioxide Gauges installed some years ago at Holbeach Gardens, Sidcup, and at Riverside Road, North Cray. The Deposit Gauges record principally the solid matter falling out of the air in the course of a month. Amongst the matter collected is cement flue dust emanating from cement factories situated east of Dartford. The average total solids deposited at North Cray are equivalent to 12.21 tons per square mile each month, and at Blackfen the corresponding figure is 11.43. Both recordings are similar to those obtained in 1957. Not all of this matter can be considered as originating from the cement industry, but concern is still felt in this connection. The Council is a constituent member of the Thames-side Joint Committee for the Abatement of Atmospheric Pollution, which seeks to eliminate this nuisance. A request made to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government for a Public Enquiry into the cement flue dust nuisance was not acceded to. During the year the Chairman accompanied by some members of the Public Health Committee, visited one of the factories concerned. The Council is represented on the Thames-side Joint Committee for the Abatement of Atmospheric Pollution by Mr. E. W. White and Mr. A. V. Hatley. Representatives on the Standing Conference of Co-operating Bodies in the Investigation of Atmospheric Pollution are Mr. A. V. Hatley and Mr. C. E. Wiltshire, and on the London and Home Counties Clean Air Advisory Council, Mrs. E. V. Wallace and the Chief Public Health Inspector. 45 Footscray County Primary School, Sidcnp.

There are two small open air swimming pools in the area. One is in the grounds of a factory and is used by employees, whilst the other, although privately owned, admits members of the public on a limited scale. Treatment is undertaken to keep the water in a pure condition. Six visits have been paid to these baths whilst in use and a sample of water taken from each proved satisfactory. There is a further pool attached to a London County Council Children's Home. Six samples taken from another place which might have been used for swimming, proved to be unsatisfactory. VERMINOUS CONDITIONS AND UNCLEANLINESS. Eighteen complaints were received in connection with premises alleged to be verminous or filthy and in this connection 34 inspections were made. In fifteen cases insect infestation was found, three of them being premises controlled by the Council. Work of disinfestation was carried out by the Department, in all but one of these houses, the other being dealt with by the occupier. From time to time the attention of the Department is drawn to the unclean conditions under which elderly persons are living, usually alone. Where possible assistance is given in co-operation with the District Officer of the Kent County Council. WATER SUPPLY. The supply of water to the district is from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. In one case only are there premises within the district not connected to the publjc supply, water being obtained from a private well. Six samples of water taken from three wells in the district all proved to be satisfactory. Routine sampling is carried out by the Metropolitan Water Board and the results are indicated in the following tables. Twenty-two samples were also taken by the Department and submitted for both bacteriological and chemical analysis. All were reported to be satisfactory. A sample taken from a domestic storage cistern proved to be unsatisfactory, but a further sample was found to be in order. I am informed by the Director of water examination to the Metropolitan Water Board that the supply has been adequate during the year, and that there have been no extensions to the mains. 52 Average Results of the Chemical Examination of the water supplied to the Urban District of Chislehurst and Sidcup during 1958.

It will be remembered that a "five" year programme of slum clearance was adopted by the Council in 1955. It was in fact decided to complete this programme in three years. The position is as follows:— 1956 Programme. Hope and Sydney Cottages, Main Road, St. Paul's Cray, declared a Clearance Area have now been demolished by the owner. 1-6, Albert Place, Main Road, St. Paul's Cray, declared a Clearance Area, have been purchased by the Council and site cleared. 69-71, Halfway Street, Sidcup, declared to be individually unfit, have been demolished by the owner. 1957 Programme. 4, 5 and 6, Woods Cottages, Nelson Road, Sidcup, declared to be individually unfit houses, were closed by agreement of the owner and have since been demolished. Rose Cottage and Nutley Cottage, High Street, Footscray, declared to be individually unfit, were closed by agreement with the owner. 5, Cray Road, Footscray, was declared to be unfit and closed by agreement with the owner. 19 and 20, Garden Cottages, Footscray, scheduled for the 1957 programme, have been improved by the owner and are being kept under observation. Additional to the programme, 16 and 17 Mill Place, Chislehurst, were dealt with the former by demolition and the latter by a Closing Order. 1958 Programme. The twelve houses known as 1-12, School Cottages, Church Road, Footscray, were declared a Clearance Area and negotiations are in progress for purchase from the owner. HOUSING ACT, 1949. During the year, 62 applications for Improvement Grants were received and 32 Grants were made. The large majority of cases concerned the provisions of a bathroom and hot water supply, in premises lacking such amenities. The total amount of the works concerned amounted to £14,515, whilst the sum of grants came to £6,575. 58 RENT ACT, 1957. CERTIFICATES OF DISREPAIR. Applications for Certificates of Disrepair continued to be received, but at a slower rate than during the first few months after the coming into operation of the Rent Act, 1957. Seventy-two new premises were involved, whilst a considerable number of forms of the various types laid down in the Act were issued in connection with previous applications. A noticeable feature is the comparatively few applications received from landlords for cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair. Of the 41 Certificates issued up to the end of 1958, only ten had been cancelled, together with a Certificate issued under the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954. Three applications were refused after the tenant had made the statutory objection, although in two of these instances Certificates were cancelled on the receipt of further applications from the landlords. The following is a summary of the work carried out:— (1) Number of applications for certificates 60 (2) Number of decisions not to issue certificates Nil. (one withdrawn) (3) Number of decisions to issue certificates: (a) in respect of some but not all defects 16 (.two sequently withdrawn) (b) in respect of all defects 43 (4) Number of undertakings given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule 42 (5) Number of undertakings refused by Local Authority under proviso to paragraph 5 of the First Schedule 2 (6) Number of Certificates issued 26 (7) Number of applications for Cancellation of Certificates 14 (8) Number of applications from landlords or tenants for Certificates as to the remedying of works which the landlord has undertaken to remedy 38 All of these were subsequently granted. New Houses. The following table shows the number of new houses and flats erected during the year:— New Houses. New Flats. Erected by Council 82 72 Erected by Private Developers 125 92 Totals 207 164 371 dwellings. 59 Council Houses. The following information has been supplied by the Housing Manager:— Prior to 1958.

(b) Prefabricated dwellings 28 families from waiting list. 153 The figure of 263 lettings includes 110 transfers which have been affected from various types of Council controlled property. During the year 17 families have been admitted to the Halfway Houses. 5. The total number of families on the waiting list as at the 31st January, 1959:— Couples 513 Families requiring two bedrooms 577 Families requiring three bedrooms 417 Families requiring four or more bedrooms 27 Old Age Pensioners and single persons 214 Applicants passed for accommodation 60 Families in requisitioned premises 51 1,859 During the year, 39 properties have been released from requisition and 4 temporary bungalows on the Chalk Pit Estate were demolished in connection with the permanent development now taking place. MOVEABLE DWELLINGS. With the clearance of caravans from the Corke's Meadow site in 1957, the total number of families using moveable dwellings showed a large decline. The principal problem now centres on the encampment at Chalk Pit, Ruxley, which was first used for this purpose during the last war, by dwellers from Corke's Meadow. 60 Other sites in the district are small, totalling 10 in number, one less than in 1947. The largest of these is occupied by four) families, and the total number of families is 17, as against 20, in the previous year. A number of applications for new licences to use moveable dwellings continue to be received, and are dealt with in conjunction with the Engineer and Surveyor. They are usually refused on Town Planning grounds. Another problem is posed, particularly in the winter months, by the unauthorised use by itinerant caravaners of plots of land adjoining the Trunk Road A.20. They are usually ejected by the owners with some difficulty, before a licence under the Public Health Act becomes necessary. The sites used by them are often left in a dirty condition. The position at the end of the year is given below:— Site Average number of families Approx. number of persons Whether licensed Smallgain's Farm 2 4 Yes Ruxley Manor Farm 2 6 Yes Birchwood (adjoining Bull Hotel) 4 11 3 L., 1 N.L Lower Hockenden Farm 1 2 Yes Old Brickfield, Baugh Estate 2 6 Yes Twysdens Meadow 2 8 1 L., 1 N.L.

Of these 23 applied for renewal of their licences and in view of pending legal proceedings, to be taken by the owner, to secure vacant possession, licences were issued to the applicants to expire on the 31st June. In July seven of these families applied for the renewal of their licences and these were issued to expire on the 31st August. In July the Court granted injunctions to the owner against 27 of the occupants requiring removal of their dwellings within two months. Many families subsequently left the Pit, and of these 9 moved on to an adjoining site, under the same ownership. The owner erected a fence and gate to prevent further trespass into the Pit, leaving eight families there. During the last two months of the year however, nine families returned, forced an entrance and took up occupation. Further action is being taken by the owner in an attempt to ensure that the injunctions are complied with. SECTION E. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOODS. 62 SECTION E. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOODS. INSPECTIONS. There are known to be 53 premises within the district in which food is prepared, or where it is stored or from which it is sold. Details of the different categories are given later in this Section. A total of 3,197 visits of inspection have been made to the premises, which indicates a considerable increase in this aspect of the Department's work, over the year. It is interesting to note, too, that the number of defects remedied at 502 shows an increase. This is an indication of the policy of vigorous action pursued since the passing of the Food Hygiene Regulations 1955, which has now resulted to a large extent, in premises being brought to the structural standard required. It is still necessary to insist that the hot water washing facilities are used and that the other personal requirements of the Regulations are complied with. In many instances, it is found that the personnel in food shops. restaurants and canteens frequently change. It is the responsibility of the management to train the new staff in hygiene precautions and the Inspectors offer considerable assistance in this direction. Generally it has been found that owners of premises and their staffs are co-operative and the Inspector's verbal requirements are usually complied with. It was necessary to serve only 164 notices, 63 of which were confirmed in writing, and in no instance had legal proceedings to be instituted under the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955. FOOD COMPLAINTS. Twenty-one complaints concerning conditions found by purchasers of food, and alleged to be abnormal, were investigated. These enquiries are often protracted, as frequently the foodstuff was prepared outside the district, and in a few instances in foreign countries. In some cases, detailed investigation is required to ensure that foreign matter had not entered the food, possibly inadvertently, whilst it was in the possession of the complainant. As is usual, the largest number of complaints concerned milk (4) or bread and flour confectionery (6). Although the dairy concerns take elaborate precautions to prevent milk being filled into dirty bottles, a proportion filters through, one being found to contain an empty shampoo sachet. In this connection the public doubtlessly, must share some of the blame for the gross manner in 63 which milk bottles are misused. There is less excuse for those responsible for the sale of bread containing foreign matter, although the human element seems to play a part here. Some complaints concerned outdated or mouldy pies, etc., and the Committee brought to the attention of those concerned the desirability of marking such short lived produce with a date, indicating to the purchaser the day on which it was manufactured. In appropriate instances, those responsible for the sale of unsatisfactory items of food stuff were required to take steps to prevent, as far as possible, any recurrence. In a number of cases, warning letters were sent and the following prosecutions were instituted:— Match stick in loaf—fined £10, plus £3 3s. costs. Mouldy meat pie—fined £28, plus £5 5s. costs. Infested oatmeal—fined £25, plus £5 5s. costs. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1955.

The following are details of licences to deal in specially designated milks, issued by the Council in respect of 1958:— Dealers. Supplementary. Pasteurised 19 14 Sterilised 27 13 Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised 19 13 68 BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. Thirty-five samples of designated milk were taken with the following results:— Number passing phosphatase test 32 Number failing phosphatase test — Number passing methylene blue test 32 Number giving unsatisfactory methylene blue result — Number passing the turbidity test (sterilised) 3 Thirty-four samples of milk were submitted for chemical examination, all of which proved satisfactory. ICE CREAM. Eleven samples were taken during the year. Eight were placed in Grade I, two in Grade II and one in Grade IV. Five samples of ice lollies were taken, all of which were satisfactory. PIGGERIES. There are twelve piggeries in the district. This indicates a decrease of three on the year, and is part of a trend against pig keeping on a small scale, noticeable since shortly after the war. Approximately 1,850 pigs are kept, one large piggery accounting for 1,000 animals and another for 450. 80 visits were paid to these piggeries. SECTION F. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. 70 SECTION F. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. General. Three hundred and eighty-seven notifications of infectious diseases, excluding tuberculosis, were received in 1958, compared with 1,954 in the previous year. This is one of the smallest totals on record. The main factor contributing to this big drop in notifications was the light incidence of measles. This is usually anticipated after an epidemic year and, in fact, only 145 cases were reported compared with 1,448 in 1957. Whooping Cough, Food Poisoning and Dysentery also compared favourably with the previous year and the infectious diseases in general again showed the mild characteristics noticed in recent years. Reference to individual diseases will be found under the separate headings. Acute Anterior Poliomyelitis. Seven cases were notified during 1958, four of these being paralytic and three non-paralytic, and all were admitted to hospital. No deaths from this disease were recorded in the Urban District during the year under review. The County Medical Officer has kindly supplied the following figures which show the number of residents in the Urban District who were vaccinated against poliomyelitis during 1958:— Year of Birth. Given two injections. Given third injection. 1958 167 — 1957 980 34 1956 960 143 1955 971 125 1954 919 119 1953 859 111 1952 801 107 1951 810 134 1950 551 167 1949 467 153 1948 535 185 1947 576 167 1946 1,304 33 1945 994 17 1944 996 7 Others 1,739 54 13,629 1,556 71 Diphtheria and Diphtheria Immunisation. I am pleased to be able to report a complete absence of this disease in the Urban District during 1958. The County Medical Officer has kindly furnished the following information with regard to Diphtheria Immunisation:— Of the children resident in the area who were born since 1943, a total of 1,046 received primary inoculations and 688 received reinforcing inoculations during 1958. A total of 17,714 children under the age of fifteen years on 31st December, 1958, have completed a course of immunisation at some time prior to that date. Dysentery. The figures for 1958 show a considerable decrease when compared with those for the previous year. Twelve cases were notified as against eighty-one in 1957. One patient was admitted to hospital, but no deaths were recorded from this disease. Food Poisoning. A total of twelve confirmed cases of food poisoning occurred in the area during 1958, as against twenty-three during the previous year. There were no serious outbreaks of this disease, most of the cases reported being isolated ones, a fact which tends to show that care and cleanliness in the storage and preparation of food is as important in the home kitchen as it is elsewhere. The following is a copy of the annual return rendered to the Ministry of Health:— 1. Local Authority: Chislehurst & Sidcup Urban District Council. Year: 1958. 2.

One hundred and forty-five notifications of this disease were received during the year, compared with 1,448 in 1957. Only one case was admitted to hospital and no deaths were recorded. The big drop in cases of this disease followed the expected pattern after a year of heavy incidence. Meningococcal Infections. Two cases were notified and both were admitted to hospital. No deaths were recorded. Pneumonia. Thirty-nine cases were notified during the year, as against forty-five in 1957. There were forty-four deaths from pneumonia. This figure includes people who are normally resident in the Urban District but who died outside the area. 73 Scarlet Fever. Eighty-nine cases were notified, and twenty-five of these were admitted to hospital. No deaths were recorded. Although the total was somewhat above the figure for the previous year when 56 cases were notified, the great majority were once again of a mild character and free from complications. Smallpox and Vaccination. No cases of this disease occurred in the area during 1958, but several contacts were under surveillance at various times during the year. The policy of offering re-vaccination to all members of the staff of the Health Department was maintained. During the year a total of 380 International Certificates of Vaccination passed through the hands of the department for purposes of authenticating doctors' signatures. The County Medical Officer informs me that a total of 814 residents in the area received primary vaccination and 74 revaccination during 1958. Tuberculosis. The following table shows the position with regard to tuberculosis, with comparative figures since 1945 (as corrected by inward and outward transfers). There were ten deaths from tuberculosis during the year. 74 Year Ended Population Notifications Number of Cases on Register Number per 1,000 pop. Pulm. Non-Pulm. Pulm. Non-Pulm.

There are now no cases receiving this form of therapy. Chislehurst and Sidcup Voluntary Tuberculosis Care Committee. I am indebted to the Liaison Officer of the above Committee for the following information:— "This Committee has been very active, and help of all kinds has been given to many families, thus relieving much of the anxiety that results from ill health; during the summer months, many families were sent to the South Coast for holidays which proved to be most beneficial. Our financial help follows the usual pattern— help with hire purchase commitments, fares to visit patients, extra nourishments, and especially help with fuel, clothing and bedding. Furniture has also been given to the patients in need of same. The office at the United Services Club, 108, Main Road, Sidcup, still continues to function every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. and many patients or their relatives call to discuss their many problems, and home visits are also maintained." Typhoid and Para-Typhoid Fever. Notifications in respect of one case of typhoid fever and one case of para-typhoid fever were received during the year. Both of these cases were removed to hospital. No deaths from these diseases were recorded. Whooping Cough. Notifications of this disease again showed a considerable decrease during the year, a total of sixty-nine cases being notified as against two hundred and seventy-nine in 1957. Only one case was admitted to hospital. No deaths from this disease were recorded in the area in 1958. The County Medical Officer informs me that 1,602 children resident in the Urban District were immunised against Whooping Cough during the year under review. 76 Other Infectious Diseases. In addition to those previously mentioned, notifications were received as under:— Erysipelas 8 cases. (One admitted to hospital) Ophthalmia Neonatorum 2 cases. (No impairment of vision in either case) APPENDIX. STATISTICAL TABLES. 78 STATISTICAL TABLES, 1958. TABLE I.—Summary of Statistics. TABLE II.—Causes of Death. TABLE III.—Infant Mortality.
