REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH Fop the Year 1902. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Haverstock Hill, Hampstead, N.W. 21 st April, 1903. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Hampstead. Gentlemen, In presenting my Report on the Health and Sanitary Condition of the Borough for 1902, I desire to thank you for the support I have received in the discharge of my duties during the past year. I also take this opportunity of bringing before the notice of the Council the valuable assistance I have received from all the members of the Public Health Staff. My especial thanks are due to Senior Inspector Kershaw who, in addition to ably assisting in the re-organization of the work of the 10 Department, has, in carrying out the special work involved in connection with the Housing Question, the inspection of Underground Bakehouses, &c., afforded me most valuable assistance. During the past year the work of the Clerical Staff has increased enormously, and to Mr. F. S. Hill, the Second Clerk, who has undertaken the whole of the statistical and the greater part of the clerical work in connection with the special inspections, I am much indebted I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HERBERT LITTLE JOHN, Medical Officer of Health. 11 Estimated Population. For the purpose of calculating the death and other rates, the population employed is that estimated to the middle of 1902, and by the usual method of computation, that amounted to 83,743. Density of Population. The area of the Borough is 2265 acres, and the estimated number of persons to the acre is 36.9. The proportion of persons to the acre at the Census, 1901, was 36.17 of the estimated population. As compared with the other Metropolitan Boroughs in Table VII., page 71, Hampstead stood fifth on the list. It will be seen on reference to Table VI., page 70, that the average number of persons per house in the Borough at the Census, 1901, was 7.25. I would point out, however, that for Census purposes a block of model dwellings or residential mansions is counted as a single house, whatever may be the number of separate tenements contained therein. Marriages. According to the Returns of the Registrar-General, 629 marriages were registered in the Borough during 1902; they were distributed in the four Quarters of the year as follows: 1st quarter 129 2nd „ 132 3rd „ 211 4th „ Total 157 629 This figure is an increase on that for the year 1901, when 545 marriages were registered. The average number per annum for the ten years 1892-1901 was 12 527, and the following Table shows the number of Marriages registered in the decade:— 1892 509 1893 476 1894 455 1895 510 1896 526 1897 521 1898 613 1899 572 1900 551 1901 545 Average of 10 years 527 1902 629 Births, During the year, 1516 births were registered, an increase of 10 as compared with the 1506 registered in the previous year. Of the total, 723 were of male and 793 of female children. The birth rate was 18'1 per 1000 of the population, that of 1901 being 18.3 per 1000. The natural increase of the population for the year, being the excess of births over deaths, was 612, as compared with an increase of 633 in 1901. Reference to Table V., page 69, shews the birth rates for Hampstead as compared with those for England and Wales since 1875, and it will be noted that since that date, the rate has only dropped as low on one other occasion, viz.:—in 1898. Of the total births registered during the year, 1477 were of legitimate and 39 of illegitimate children. Chart shewing the number of Deaths of persons resident in or belonging to the Borough,occurring during each week of 1902. In the 1st week are uicluded only those deaths occurring on days of that week which were in 1902. 9 deaths also occurred after the 52nd week viz from, 28th to 31 st December. 13 The following table shews the Ward and Sex distribution of these illegitimate births:— Sex.

The total number of births are distributed in the various Wards as follows :—No. 1 or Town Ward, 192 ; No. 2 or Belsize Ward, 239 ; No. 3 or Adelaide Ward, 103 ; No. 4 or Central Ward, 110 ; No. 5 or West End Ward, 275; No. 6 or Kilburn Ward, 435 ; and No. 7 or Priory Ward, 162. Deaths. The total deaths registered during the year amounted to 1199. Of these, however, no less than 390 were of persons not belonging to the Borough, while 95 residents of Hampstead died in outlying districts. The total number of deaths therefore, amongst persons belonging to Hampstead amounted to 904. Table IV., page 68, affords all available information as to the causes of deaths of persons belonging to the Borough. The following Chart shews the number of deaths of persons resident in, or belonging to, the Borough, occurring during each week of 1902. Death Rate. The crude death rate was 14.3 per 1000 of the population, but the true or corrected rate, obtained after substracting from the total registered deaths the deaths of non-resident persons dying in Hampstead, and adding the deaths of Hampstead residents who died outside the district, was 10.7 per 1000 of the population, as compared with the rate of 10.6 per 1000 of the population in 1901, and the average rate for the years 1892—1901, which is 11.6. 14 In Table V., page 69, the death rates of Hampstead may he compared with those of England and Wales since 1875. The following Table shews the death rate for Hampstead as compared with the County of London, the City of London, and the other Metropolitan Boroughs: — Table shewing the Death Rates from All Causes in the County of London, and the Metropolitan Boroughs during the 53 Registration Weeks of 1902.

Under one year, the mortality was 133, a decrease of 22 as compared with the previous year. This decrease is accounted for by a diminished mortality from Whooping Cough, Enteritis, Pneumonia, and other causes. Table Shewing the Causes of Death of Children Under the Age of One Year.

The deaths of persons over the age of 65 years numbered 302, as compared with 242 in 1901. Of these 138 were of persons between 65 and 75, 123 were between 75 and 85, and 41 were of persons over the age of 85 years. The following table shews the number of deaths at the various age periods, the causes of such deaths being shewn in Table IV., page 68. Age Periods.

In addition to the deaths classified under the previous heading, 11 were due to Brain Tuberculosis, 5 to General Tuberculosis, 7 to Abdominal Tuberculosis, and 1 to Tuberculosis of the Larynx. As compared with the number of deaths from these causes in 1901, there is a decrease of 21. The total mortality, therefore, from Tuberculosis in 1902 was 97, or 10.7 per cent, of the total deaths from all causes, as compared with 118 or 13.5 per cent, in 1901. Alcoholism and Cirrhosis of the Liver. In all, 12 deaths were recorded from Alcoholism and Cirrhosis of the Liver, the latter a condition most frequently associated with alcoholic intemperance.

Of the total deaths under this heading, 9 were certified as due to Epithelioma, 9 to Sarcoma, 3 to Scirrhus Cancer, and 70 to other malignant growths merely described in the death certificates as Carcinoma, Cancer, or Malignant disease. Of the total deaths from this disease, all occurred in persons over the age of 25, of which 41 were of persons of 65 years of age and upwards. Diseases of the Circulatory System. These accounted for 73 deaths, or 8.0 per cent, of the total deaths, of which 17 were due to Chronic valvular disease of the heart; 2 to Embolism or Thrombosis; and 54 to other Diseases of the Heart and Vessels of an ill-defined character. Diseases of the Respiratory System. The total mortality from this class of disease was 155, or 17.1 per Chart shewing the Monthly notifications of Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria and Membranous Croup, Enteric Fever, Small Pox and all notifiable infectious diseases (excepting Chickenpox) during 1902.

During the year, considering the prevalence of Small-pox in practically every other district in London, the number of cases notified in Hampstead were comparatively few, no more than 17 occurring: the first on the first day of the year, and the final case being reported in the middle of June, since which date no case has been reported. A reference to the Table on pages 25 and 26 shews that the disease was, as in the previous year, principally confined to the districts west of Finchley Road. Particulars in connection with the various cases are to be found in tabular form on pages 25 and 26. With regard to vaccination, in no instance had recent vaccination been performed, and in those persons who had been re-vaccinated the disease took on a distinctly milder type. The mortality was nil. The usual personal supervision on the part of myself and the Senior Sanitary Inspector was carried out, and to this and the careful tracing of persons who had been in contact with the patients, as well as to the prompt action on the part of the Vaccination authority, I attribute the absence of any secondary case arising in the several houses infected. The temporary shelter for persons who might be disturbed during the process of the disinfection of their homes was only in one instance used, but that instance alone proved the value of the provision of such accommodation. A case occurred in a family occupying a single room, the disinfection of which could not be carried out during their occupancy. The family was therefore provided with apartments at the shelter and maintained there until their house had been disinfected and they were themselves free from the risk of spreading infection. 24 The subjoined Tables give the Ward and monthly distribution of the cases, and it will be noted that 10 of the 17 cases occurred in the West Hampstead and Kilburn districts.

These latter occurred either in the persons of servants of the Hospital, or among patients admitted suffering from some other disease. Enteric Fever. 44 cases of this disease were notified, being one less than the number occurring during 1901. It will be seen from the following table that at no period of the year was there any special prevalence. 28 Of the total cases 10 proved fatal, giving a ease mortality of 22.7 per cent., or 0.ll per 1000 of the population. The sanitary condition of houses in which the cases occurred was investigated and the drains tested. Defective drains were found in 19 instances, defective soil pipes in 11 instances, and defective water supplies, &c., in 7 instances.

One case occurred in the Belsize Ward in the month of May, Notifications of this disease are of rare occurrence, no case having occurred in Hampstead during the years 1898 and 1899, only 1 in 1900. and none during 1901. Chicken-pox. It was owing to the general prevalence of Small-pox in the Metropolis and its resemblance to Chicken-pox that the Council decided to make this disease notifiable, and an Order of the Borough Council to that effect, confirmed by the Local Government Board, came into operation on 20th December, 1901. This Order made chicken-pox a notifiable disease for the period of six months. On the 22nd April, 1902, the London County Council made a similar Order, which came into force on the 6th May, and applied to the whole of the Administrative County of London. 31 Again, on the 21st October, 1902, the County Council made another Order extending the period to which notification of this disease applied, to the 7th January, 1903. Chicken-pox has thus, by Orders of the Borough Council and the London County Council, been a notifiable disease during the whole of the year under review. 420 cases of the disease were notified. The expenses connected with the notification of this disease were considerable, and as far as the detection of errors in diagnosis was concerned, the measure proved of small value.

Totals 3 1 4 Influenza. 26 deaths resulted from this disease, as compared with 10 in 1901. Of the total deaths, 15 occurred to persons of 65 years of age or upwards. Pulmonary Phthisis and its Voluntary Notification. From the commencement of the year under review Voluntary Notification of Phthisis has been in operation, and during the twelve months 51 cases have been, under this arrangement, brought to the knowledge of the Health Department. The cases notified during 1902 numbered 51, of which 32 were of males, and 19 of females. 33 Of the total cases 41 were investigated, with the following results:— In 4 cases, or 9.7 per cent., no family history was obtainable. In 20 cases, or 48.8 per cent., there was no history of Phthisis in family. (In three of these cases, however, history of other lung diseases in the family was obtained.) In 17 cases, or 41.4 per cent., other members of the family had suffered from Phthisis. Unhealthy conditions were, in 25 per cent, of the cases, found in the dwellings occupied by the patients. Disinfection of the premises, bedding, etc., was carried out in 13 cases. The following is a list of the occupations followed by the above patients, as far as ascertained:— Architect 1 Baker 1 Brewer's labourer 1 Builder's storekeeper 1 Cabman 1 Caretaker 1 Charwoman 1 Coachman 1 Domestic servants 4 Errand boy 1 Furniture remover 1 Housewives 6 Ironer. 1 Iron moulder 1 Labourers 5 Lifeguardsman 1 Male nurse 1 Milk carrier 1 Navvy 1 34 Needlewoman 1 No occupation 2 Ostler 1 Pensioner 1 Post Office Clerks 2 Sister in Convent 1 Schoolboy 1 Tailor 1 Ticket collector 1 Watchman 1 The number of cases notified is little more than half of that originally estimated; hut it must be remembered that the Notification of this disease is entirely new not only to Hampstead but to the Metropolis generally, and in the Provinces its successful adoption has been the outcome of years of labour, educational and persuasive, on the part of Sanitary Authorities with the assistance afforded them by certain sections of the public. In the amelioration of the conditions under which consumptives live the assistance of outside workers is most useful. Indeed in the absence of Compulsory Notification, the very nature of the disease renders their aid an essential factor in promoting the great work of its prevention. Lay workers can, by their absence of officialism, and with the greater time at their disposal, do much to clicit facts of the greatest importance to the patient himself, and at the same time prepare him for the visit of the Sanitary Inspector, whose intentions are not always quite understood, but which are always directed towards an improvement of the patients' condition and in the interests of the public health. In Hampstead, the benefits resulting from Voluntary Notification have been greatly augmented through the cordial co-operation of the District Visitors of the local Health Society, whose efforts have been all tended towards securing an improvement in the surroundings of the patient whether sanitary or purely domestic. This work they have carried out without friction between the patients and themselves, and without hampering the work of the Health Department. 35 FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901. Factories, Workshop, and Workplaces. In the year 1802, what may be described as the first Factory Act, became law, so that a century of inspection and investigation has been the basis upon which this Act has been framed. From a perusal of its provisions and some experience of its application, it appears to me to be a matter for regret that such an extended experience should have resulted in a measure so confusing in its interpretation and unsatisfactory in its working. The Act, as a consolidating and amending measure clears up to a great extent the ground covered by previous Acts, but much might have been done to simplify, in the Metropolis at all events, the procedure connected with it. For instance, while professing to deal comprehensively with Workshops and Workplaces, proceedings for the provision of sufficient sanitary conveniences must be taken under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Further, with regard to the heating and ventilation of a Workshop, the control of the latter is partly under the supervision of the Local Authority, while the provisions relating to the former appear to be entirely within the province of Ilis Majesty's Inspector. With regard to the distinction to be drawn between Factories and Workshops, that of the employment of mechanical power is most indefinite. Take the case of a large business premises, carrying on such work as dressmaking, the selling of butchers meat and other comestibles, the making up and dispensing of medicines, and in the basement of the same building a gas engine is employed for sausage making. Is the whole building to be considered as a Factory, or is that portion of the premises in which mechanical power is used for a special purpose, to be alone a Factory and the remaining departments dealt with as Workshops. The definitions contained in Section 149 arc extremely vague. 36 It appears to me that to the Borough Council, whose Inspectors are constantly visiting such places, should be delegated the duties of supervising all matters connected with the health of the workers in, and the sanitation of, Factories and Workshops; and that they should further be the Authority by whom the provisions of the Shop Hours and Shop Assistants Seats Acts ought to be administered. That one Inspector from the London County Council should visit for the purpose of inspecting the means of fire escape in a Factory, that he may be followed by a Borough Council's Inspector to ascertain the nature and amount of the sanitary conveniences, and that in addition there may be visits from Inspectors from the Home Office and London County Council in connection with overtime and the hours of shop assistants, seems unreasonable, and this overlapping of inspection cannot fail to give rise to annoyance to the occupiers of work premises, and in my own experience the inconvenience of this arrangement has been frequently the subject of complaint. Factories and Workshops. At the end of the year 1901, number of Factories and Workshops on the Register 251 At the end of the year 1902— Number of Factories on the Register 19 Number of Workshops and Laundries on the Register 530 During the year 1902, number of Workshops removed from the Register 34 Number of Workshops added to the Register 325 Number of Factories added to the Register 7 In addition to the above, laundry work is carried on in the following Charitable Institutions which are specially exempted from the provisions of the Act:— Trewint Industrial School, Haverstock Hill (36 girls). Cavendish Home, Pond Street (26 girls). 37 Record of Work under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. Inspection. Number of Workshop Inspections 947 Number of Re-inspections of Workshops 352 Shops and Offices inspected 214 Workrooms measured 101 Cleanliness.—87 workrooms were found in a dirty condition: 23 of these were cleansed on the verbal request of the Inspector; 64 were cleansed under notice. Ventilation.—The power to deal with badly-ventilated workrooms is much increased by Section 7 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. Here it is stated that "in every room in any factory or workshop sufficient means of ventilation shall be provided and sufficient ventilation shall be maintained." In 12 workrooms sufficient ventilation was not maintained, and permanent ventilators have been fixed in these. The Inspector in all cases explains the necessity for ventilation and draws the attention of the occupiers of workrooms to the clause quoted above, and on the whole there has been a distinct improvement in the matter of keeping windows open. In the register of inspections the state of ventilation is recorded. Warming.—During December several workrooms were found which were either not warmed at all or were being heated by open gas jets thus not complying with Section 6 of the Factory and Workshop Act, where it is stated that "in every factory and workshop adequate measures must be taken for securing and maintaining a reasonable temperature in each room in which any person is employed, but the measures so taken must not interfere with the purity of the air of any room in which any person is employed." In the majority of cases the Inspector was able to persuade occupiers to arrange to warm the workrooms with fires or gas-stoves with flues; other cases were reported to H.M. Inspector of Factories, the Local Authority having unfortunately no power to enforce the law regarding temperature. 38 Overcrowding.—18 workrooms were found to be overcrowded. The majority of these were workshops newly placed upon the register. In all cases except one, the nuisance was abated on serving an intimation notice. In the remaining case—a laundry—a statutory notice was served, the nuisance was then abated, and the premises are being kept under observation. Sanitary Defects.—Apart from cleanliness, ventilation, and overcrowding, the Workshop Inspectors have discovered in the course of their visits 122 nuisances liable to be dealt with under the Public Health Act, which have been promptly dealt with. Sanitary Conveniences.—6 workshops, 8 shops, and 13 offices were found to be without sanitary conveniences of any kind. 3 workshops and 25 shops where persons of both sexes are employed were found to be without separate sanitary conveniences. Section 38 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, provides that " every factory, workshop, and workplace whether erected before or after the passing of this Act, shall be provided with sufficient and suitable accommodation in the way of sanitary conveniences, regard being had to the number of persons employed in or in attendance at such building, and also where persons of both sexes are, or are intended to be employed, or in attendance, with proper separate accommodation for persons of each sex." Accordingly these have been reported to the Public Health Committee, who have given instructions for proper and sufficient accommodation to be provided. Notice has been sent to H.M. Inspector of Factories in respect of 109 workshops where protected persons were employed, but where the prescribed abstract was not displayed. 39 Home Work.—Under the Factory and Workshop Act of 1901 new powers are conferred upon Borough Councils with regard to " outworkers." The occupiers of factories, workshops, and other places from which any work is given out are required to keep lists showing the names and addresses of all persons employed by them, and the places where they are employed, and to send copies of the lists to the Council twice a year, on or before February 1 and August 1. These lists must then be examined, and the name and place Of employment of every outworker whose place of employment is in another district, must be furnished to the Council of that district. The classes of work to which these provisions apply have been fixed by the Secretary of State, and are as follows: — 1. The making, cleaning, washing, altering, ornamenting, finishing and repairing of wearing apparel, and any work incidental thereto; 2. The making, ornamenting, mending, and finishing of lace, and of lace curtains and nets ; 3. Cabinet and furniture making and upholstery work ; 4. The making of electro plate ; 5. The making of files ; 6. Fur-pulling. Employment of Persons in Unwholesome Premises. The Borough Council may prohibit the giving out of work to be done in any place which is injurious or dangerous to the health of the persons employed therein. Prohibition of Homework in Places where there is Infectious Disease. If any inmate of a house in which home work is done is suffering from a notifiable infectious disease, the Council may, whether the patient has been removed from the house or not, prohibit the giving out of work to any person living or working in that house. 40 This power only applies to the following classes of work prescribed by the Secretary of State. 1. The making, cleaning, washing, altering, ornamenting, finishing, and repairing of wearing apparel, and any work incidental thereto; 2. The making, ornamenting, mending, and finishing of lace, and of lace curtains and nets; 3. Upholstery work, and 4. Fur pulling. In order to apply these powers a register is kept of all outworkers, living or working in the borough; this register at present contains the names of 74 persons, and on receipt of a Certificate relating to Infectious Disease, reference is made to the Register to see if any outworker is resident in the house in question. 19 0 2.

Underground Bakehouses to which special provisions in the Factory and Workshop Act of 1901 apply, are dealt with on page 44. The following remarks however refer to all bakehouses, whether above or under ground, inspected during the year. At the end of 1902 there were 40 Bakehouses on the Register. The subjoined Table shews the work done in connection with these premises. Number of inspections made 81 Instances where cleansing and limewashing has been carried out 25 Undesirable articles removed from bakehouses 4 Water closet apparatus renewed 2 Water closets cleansed ., 2 Improperly placed gully trap removed 1 Gullies cleansed 5 Sink waste pipes repaired and trapped 2 Foul sinks cleansed 3 Gutter repaired .. 1 Water cistern cleansed 1 Foul and defective dust-bin abolished 1 Bust receptacles provided 5 Cover to dust receptacle provided 1 Manure receptacle provided . . . . .. .. 1 From personal inspection, as well as from the reports of the Inspectors, I am satisfied that much has still to be done to ensure that the making of bread, confectionery, &c., and the processes incidental (hereto, shall be carried on under proper hygienic conditions. Such important matters as ventilation and lighting have been in many instances neglected, while general cleanliness, whether of the bakehouse itself or of its sanitary arrangements, appears to have in most instances been considered one of little importance. Bakehouses, especially those in connection with dwelling houses, have been employed for the storage of all kinds of unnecessary stores, and in some instances they were also used as the family washhouse. 44 Underground Bakehouses. Section 101 (2) of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, provides that "after the 1st day of January, 1904, an underground bakehouse shall not be used unless certified by the district Council to be suitable for that purpose." Further, an underground bakehouse is for the first time defined as being " a bakehouse, any baking room of which is so situate that the surface of the floor is more than three feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street, or the ground adjoining or nearest to the room." It was obvious that although these premises had been, as in the case of over ground bakehouses regularly inspected, a special inspection would be necessary before the Council could be in a position to consider the question of granting certificates, and this was commenced in the month of October. This work has taken up a considerable amount of the time of the Senior Sanitary Inspector and myself. FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS.

The Vendor was about to hand the jug to agent when he saw the Inspector approaching, he immediately emptied the contents of the jug back into his can and then kicked the can over, spilling about 7 quarts of milk on the roadway. Shortly afterwards ho was observed to empty the contents (water) of a 4-quart can into the roadway. For this obstruction he was summoned before Mr. Curtis Bennett at Marylebone Police Court on 15th August, and was fined £3 and £1 13s. 6d. costs. In default of distress one month's imprisonment. Sample No. 272, Milk—Delivered by contract to North-Western Fever Hospital. Sample procured in course of delivery was found on analysis to be adulterated. Vendors were summonsed before Mr. Curtis Bennett at Marylebone Police Court on May 9th. After two adjournments, the case was dismissed with 3 guineas costs, it having been proved that the quality of the milk came up to the standard prescribed in the Hospital contract and arrived at by the reading of Horsley's Lactometer. This is an antiquated and unreliable method of analysis, and its use by the Metropolitan Asylums Board for standardizing the milk supply of its Hospitals is, in my opinion, indefensible. Bank Holidays.—A. general inspection has been made of the food sold on the Heath on these days, and various samples taken. All have been found satisfactory, except sample No. 55 "Sarsaparilla," which was found to be a mixture of water and sugar, flavoured by a trace of pear drop essence. The sample contained no Sarsaparilla.The Vendor, who lived at King's Cross, was summonsed before the Justices at the Hampstead Petty Sessional Court, where he was fined Is. and 2s. costs. Legislation.—The Board of Agriculture under Sec. 4 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, made the following regulation which extends to Great Britain, and came into force on May 15th, 1902:— Where the proportion of water in a sample of butter exceeds 16 48 per cent., it shall be presumed for the purposes of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899, until the contrary is proved that the butter is not genuine by reason of the excessive amount of water therein. This, coupled with the order of 1st September, 1901, laying down a standard for milk, protect the pnblic from the sale of these articles, which, although not actually adulterated, are not of the nature or substance of the article demanded. Inspection of Nuisances. During the year 8557 inspections have been made by the District or other Inspectors, and 11,282 re-inspections were made after Order or Notice. I have tabulated on page 74 the nature of the nuisances investigated. Many of these inspections were made on complaint, but in a number of instances the nuisances were discovered during the ordinary inspection by the District Inspectors. It cannot be too strongly pointed out that only by a systematic inspection can the existence of nuisances be discovered and abated and the general health of the Borough maintained; and during the past year it has been my endeavour to inaugurate a systematic houseto-house inspection of the more populous districts with these objects in view. It is apparent that in many parts of the Borough, houses originally erected for occupation by one family are now let off in parts and occupied by several families. In addition, the houses as a whole have changed hands and have come into possession of owners whose first care is certainly not for the sanitary welfare of their tenants. This re-arrangement of ownership and tenancy has been the means of transforming dwelling-houses originally built for the occupation of the well-to-do classes into very ordinary tenement dwellings. The owners appear to take little interest in necessary repairs, and 49 the tenants, from want of a proper supervision on the part of the owners, are permitted to misuse the sanitary fittings, &c., to the extent of creating conditions which I am constantly callcd upon to deal with. My experience has been that obligations necessarily entailed on the ownership of property sit lightly on those who make their living out of it. The delegation of their authority to agents may bo necessary, but, that is, in my opinion, no reason why, owing to this absence of proper supervision on their part, insanitary conditions of the gravest kind are being constantly reported to me by the Inspectors or complained of by the inhabitants of such houses in many parts of the Borough. Effluvium Nuisance. A representation was made by 11 inhabitants in respect of a nuisance of this nature arising from a bedstead factory in Dunboyne Street. On inspection, it was found that a serious nuisance did exist, owing to the escape of the fumes from the japanning chambers. Proceedings were commenced against the occupier who undertook to do certain works for the purpose of abating the nuisance, and an adjournment was granted. He constructed exhaust shafts and fans from the japanning chambers, which conducted the fumes through the melting furnace, the chimney flue of which was heightened considerably. While a considerable improvement resulted, the nuisance was not entirely abated, and at a further hearing the occupier announced his intention of vacating the premises and removing his factory outside the county. The hearing was therefore further adjourned in order to allow this arrangement to be carried out. Two complaints of effluvia nuisances arising from the process of ballast burning were received, but in each case the fire was extinguished and the nuisance abated upon the service of an intimation notice. 50 Inspection of Drainage, &c., of New Premises. Prior to 31st Jul}', this work had been carried out under the directions of the Works Committee, but after a joint meeting of the Works and Public Health Committees this duty was transferred to the Public Health Committee; the prevailing opinion being that the Committee responsible for the sanitary condition of occupied premises and the health of their inmates, was the proper body to determine the manner in which dwelling-houses, &c., should be drained. In my opinion it would conduce to better working were the actual supervision of the drainage and all other sanitary works in connection with new premises, transferred to the Public Health Department. It has, on certain occasions, happened that on the inspection by a Sanitary Inspector for a Water Certificate, infringements of Byelaws have been discovered, which have presumably escaped the eye of the officer whose duty it was to supervise such buildings. This necessitates the issuing of notices, &c., and may lead to a conflict of official opinion and authority. Under the present system, I do not see how these difficulties are to be overcome, as the dual control above-mentioned, and the fact that the supervision of new buildings is conducted by an official who is not only not a qualified Sanitary Inspector, but whose most important duties are in connection with the inspection of, and maintenance of, Sewers, interfere with that efficient control of all new drainage as could be ensured were this duty in the hands of the staff of the Health Department. Slaughter-houses. These premises, five in number, have been periodically inspected during the year, and on the whole have been well maintained and the processes carried on therein conducted in such a manner as to conform with the Bye-laws. 51 In two instances, Bye-law 2, which prohibits the slaughter of animals within the view of other animals, was found to have been contravened, but on this being brought to the notice of the occupiers, this practice was at once discontinued. Oil the annual inspection of these premises in October the Public Health Committee found it again necessary to complain of the condition of the Slaughter-house at 6, Fairfax Mews, and of that at the rear of 242, Belsize Road. In the former a watercloset was in direct ventilation with the Slaughter-house ; while in the latter the same condition as was complained of last year—viz., the ventilation of a stable into the Slaughter-house, still existed, though to a somewhat less extent. The Borough Council opposed these licenses. In both of the above instances the Public Health Committee of the London County Council ordered the works to be carried out which would in their opinion meet with their approval, and the licenses were granted There can be no doubt but that the inspection as now carried on, has resulted in these premises being kept in a more cleanly state, and the processes connected with the slaughter of animals and the preparation of their carcases for food conducted in a manner more calculated to preserve the Public Health and less likely to inflict unnecessary suffering upon the animals. The following is a list of the existing Slaughter-houses in the Borough:—40, England's Lane; 17, High Street; 69, High Street; 242, Belsize Road (in rear of) 6, Fairfax Mews. Inspections, Works Executed, &c., in Connection with Slaughter-houses. Slaughter-house inspections made 94 Slaughter-houses whitewashed 15 Water closets re-constructed and cut off from Slaughter-house 1 Water closets cleaned 1 Soil pipes renewed 1 Paving repaired 1 52 Cow-houses. There has been no licensed cow-house in the Borough since the year 1898. Common Lodging Houses. The Borough possesses only one Common Lodging House, viz :— " Holly Mount Cottage," Holly Mount. This house, which is registered to accommodate 35 men, is, I understand, about to be closed by the Licensing Authority, the London County Council, and on sanitary grounds this is, in my opinion, desirable. Ice Creams. Yery important, and much needed legislation dealing with the manufacture, etc., of this commodity came into operation on the 1st November, 1902, when the London County Council (General Powers) Act became law. The duty of enforcing these regulations is placed on the Sanitary Authorities, and with a view to a careful supervision over the manufacture, storage and sale of ice cream, I have prepared a register of all vendors, whose premises are now regularly inspected. The London County Council supplied extracts from the above Act relating to the storage and sale of Ice Creams, and these have been left with every person on the Register. The following is a copy of the Notice: — LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. ICE CREAMS. The London County Council hereby gives notice that Part VIII. of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902, which will come into operation on 1st November, 1902, provides as follows:— o3 Any person being a manufacturer of or merchant or dealer in ice creams or other similar commodity who within the County— ('/) Causes or permits ice creams or any similar commodity to be manufactured sold or stored in any cellar shed or room in which there is any inlet or opening to a drain or which is used as a living room or sleeping room; (6) In the manufacture sale or storage of any such commodity does any act or thing likely to expose such commodity to infection or contamination or omits to take any proper precaution for the due protection of such commodity from infection or contamination ; or (c) Omits on the outbreak of any infectious disease amongst the persons employed in his business or living or working in on or about the premises in or on any part of which any such commodity as aforesaid is manufactured sold or stored to give notice thereof forthwith to the Medical Officer of the Sanitary District in which such business is carried on or such premises are situate; shall be liable for every such offence on conviction in a Court of Summary Jurisdiction to a penalty not exceeding Forty Shillings. Every itinerant vendor of any such commodity as aforesaid shall if not himself the manufacturer thereof exhibit in a legible manner on a conspicuous part of his barrow a notice stating the name and address of the person from whom he obtains such commodity, and if such vendor is himself the manufacturer of such commodity he shall in the same manner exhibit his own name and address. Every such itinerant vendor who shall fail to comply with the provisions of this Section shall be liable for each offence on conviction as aforesaid to a penalty not exceeding Forty Shillings. Proceedings for the recovery of the penalties shall be instituted by the Sanitary Authority for the District in which the offence was committed or of the District to the Medical Officer of which such notification 54 as aforesaid ought to have been made or in which sucli itinerant vendor as aforesaid shall offer any such commodity as aforesaid for sale as the case may be. Spring Gardens, S.W., (Signed) G. L. Gomme, 11th September, 1902. Clerk of the Council. Unsound Food. During the year the inspection of food supply has been systematically carried out by the Senior Inspector, and the Special Inspectoi appointed for that purpose, and the following is a table showing the seizures or surrenders which have taken place. Date. 1902. Premises. Unsound Food Seized or Surrendered. February 26th High Road, Kilburn 36 bananas. April 23rd Mill Lane 1 sheep's liver. April 23rd High Road, Kilburn 9 lbs. tomatoes. April 23rd High Road, Kilburn 2 pieces of beef. June 4th Netherwood Street 4 lbs. tomatoes. June 4th Kelson Street 7 tins condensed milk. July 30th Boundary Road Portion of a trunk of fish. August 19th Mill Lane 1 tin of tomatoes. September 1st Mill Lane 1 tin of pears. October 17 th High Street 101 bottles of fruit and 3 bottles of fruit pulp. Certificates as to Water Supply. With regard to the provision of a proper and sufficient supply of water to dwelling houses, the Public Health Act, in Section 48, lays down that "a house which is newly erected shall not be occupied as a dwelling house until the sanitary authority have certified that it has a proper and sufficient supply of water." So few applications for such certificates had been made that it appeared that owners of newly-erected property were not aware of the necessity for obtaining them, and on the instruction of the Public 55 Health Committee I issued a circular letter calling attention to the provision of the Section, and intimating that this would be strictly enforced. Since then it has been the exception for a new house to become occupied without such certificate liaving first been obtained, but in instances where this Section was found to have been infringed, and a previous similar offence had been reported to the Committee, they authorised proceedings to be taken, the results of which will be seen in the table at the end of this report. The result of my inspection in connection with the granting of "Water Certificates confirms me in the belief that its importance is very great, as in some instances the water supply was found to be quite inadequate, or even absent. The total number of Certificates issued during the year was 195. Water Supply. The Borough is supplied with water by two Companies, namely, New River and "West Middlesex, which supplies are under the constant analytical supervision of Analysts who report to the Water Examiner appointed under the Metropolis Water Act, 1871, and of Dr. Thorpe on behalf of the Local Government Board. The reports of these Analysts are issued monthly. Wells. In addition to the above supply, there are a few houses in Hampstead which possess Wells, although these are not, so far as I am aware, used for drinking purposes. At the instance of the London County Council samples of the water from two "Wells were analysed, one of which proved to be of fairly good quality, while the other was not of such a high state of purity. Chalybeate Well, Well Walk. Towards the latter end of the year, the question of the purity of the water of this Well was brought under my notice, and I therefore 56 caused an analysis to be made. This proved that the water was being contaminated with surface drainage, and I thereupon represented to the Trustees interested in the upkeep of this Well, that persons drinking the water ran a serious risk of injury to their health. As a result, a Notice is now exhibited upon the Well cautioning the public against drinking the water. Ventilation of Sewers. During the past year complaints, to the number of 58, have been received by me of offensive odours emanating from the sewer ventilators in various parts of the Borough, and intimation of such complaints have been forwarded to the Borough Engineer. I have no hesitation in saying that, while the present system of ventilating sewers in Hampstead may, from an engineering point of view, be efficient, it is in my opinion most unsatisfactory. That it has actually caused illness I am not prepared to say, but I am convinced that where no means are taken to render innocuous and inodorous the sewer gases the ventilation of a sewer by a surface grating in a roadway is an improper method. The Borough Council insists upon an effective system of ventilation of private drains, and it appears to me that the sewers under their control, which must of necessity be loaded with a greater proportion of noxious gases, should be at least as efficiently ventilated. By Section 71 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, it is made compulsory that Authorities in the Metropolis shall, in connection with sewers under their control, " by providing proper traps or other coverings, or by ventilation, or by such other ways and means as shall be practicable for that purpose, prevent the effluvia of sewers from exhaling through gullyholes, gratings, or other openings of sewers in any of the streets or other places within their district or parish." I am of opinion therefore, that, where practicable, the present system should be abolished, and in its place one less likely to cause annoyance and possible danger to health be substituted. 57 Public Mortuary. During the year the bodies of 64 persons were brought to the Mortuary as against 67 last year -36 by order of the Coroner, 18 by the Police, and 10 at the request of friends of the deceased. In 50 instances, or 78 per cent, of the bodies admitted, inquests were held, and in 26 instances, or 40 per cent., post-mortem examinations were made. The following table indicates the causes of death of the persons whose bodies were received into the Mortuary. Cause of Death. Number of Bodies received. Deaths from natural causes 34 Accidental deaths 16 Suicide 9 Neglect at birth 2 Found drowned (open verdict) 3 Total 64 It will be noted that in no instance was the body of a person who had died from an infectious disease brought to the Mortuary. 58 MORTUARY RECORD FOR THE YEAR 1902.

Heath and Mrs. Fisher were appointed in place of Inspectors Loughlin and Miss Gough. In May, Mr. Leverton resigned, and Mr. J. Grimsley was appointed in his place. Mortuary Keeper.—The Mortuary Keeper, E. Littlefield, resigned, and W. Larkin was appointed to act in that capacity, in addition to carrying out the duties of an assistant to the Inspectors. Clerks.—In May, Mr. C. G. Flaxman was appointed as Third Clerk. Alteration of Sanitary Inspectors Districts. On the 18th November, 1902, I recommended to the Public Health Committee that the districts of the divisional Sanitary Inspectors should be re-arranged, with a view of making the boundaries thereof co-terminous with the wards of the Borough. This was adopted by the Council on the 27th November, and the re-arrangement took effect on 1st January, 1903. The following shews the districts as re-arranged:— District 1, Wards 1 and 2. „ 2, „ 3 „ 7. „ 3, „ 4 „ 5. „ 4, „ 6. Dangerous Structures. During the year 1902, 12 dangerous structures were reported to the Superintending Architect of the London County Council. 60 Legal Proceedings.

In 1902 there were 4 deaths of persons over 1 year of age, occurring in outlying institutions, which it is not possible classify in wards owing to a definite address not having been registered. Deaths of residents occurring in public institutions beyond the district are included in sub-columns e of this Table, and those of non-residents registered in public institutions in the district excluded. (See note on Table I. as to meaning of terms "resident" and "non-resident.") Deaths of residents occurring in public institutions, whether within or without the district, are allotted to the respective localities according to the addresses of the deceased. In the cases of 12 outlying deaths, the address given being simply "Hempstead Workhouse," these have been therefore placed in No. 1, or Town Ward. 67 TABLE III.
