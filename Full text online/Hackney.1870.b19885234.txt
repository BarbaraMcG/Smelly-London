HAC 50 REPORT ON THE Sanitary State OF THE HACKNEY DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR 1870. by JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D., L.R.C.P.E., ETC, PRESIDENT OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TO THE DISTRICT. Printed by the Board BY a. t. roberts, steam works, 5, hackney road, london. 1871. SANITARY REPORT For the Year 1870. To the Board of Works for the Hackney District. Gentlemen, I have deferred writing my Report for this year, until after the census of 1871 had been taken, as I had considerable doubt as to the precise population of the district. Thus, in a Report on the Cholera of 1866, the Registrar General published a table in which it was estimated that the population for Hackney was 97,120, whilst I calculated it to be 105,000, which was very nearly the true number. The census indicates that the population on July 1st, 1870 was about 121,627, and the mortality returns show that the number of deaths were 2,464 or at the rate of 10 deaths in each 493 living, which is a little more than two per cent. This, however, is not the true death rate of the district, as the German Hospital and City of London Union were in our district then, and the Small Pox Hospital has been opened since. In addition, for purposes of comparison with other districts, it is necessary to distribute the deaths in hospitals all over London, as it would be unfair to debit them to the districts in which they occur. It is quite certain that many of the poorer inhabitants of this district, including servants, die in hospitals out of the district. It is, therefore, necessary to eliminate the deaths in the City of London Union and the 4 German Hospital, and then to add on the proper rate of death for the number of inmates, and the pro rata number of deaths in the London hospitals and prisons. This gives 2,423 instead of 2,464 deaths for the district, which is at the rate of 10 deaths in each 511 inhabitants, or 199 per 10,000 inhabitants. The death rate for the whole of London was 241 per 10,000 inhabitants, so that the public health of Hackney was unusually good during this year. The Census for the Hackney district is as follows:— 1861. 1871. Increase. Acres. Hackney 31,481 50,087 18,606 1,731 South Hackney 15,458 30,305 14,847 472 West Hackney 24,265 28,076 3,811 472 Stamford Hill 5,483 6,599 1,116 615 Parish of St. John 76,687 115,067 38,380 3,290 Stoke Newington 6,608 9,810 3,202 639 Hackney district 83,295 124,877 41,582 3,929 In a sanitary point of view, this year has been remarkable for the termination of the most severe epidemic of scarlet fever, and the commencement of the most widely extended fatal epidemic of small pox, which have occurred since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855. In the report for 1856, I stated my opinion, that the removal of nuisances would not prevent epidemics of zymotic diseases, that is to say, of small pox, scarlet fever, measles, whooping cough, fever, &c., from breaking out at their ordinary periods. In 1856, small pox was epidemic in Hackney, slightly so in 1859, far more seriously in 1863, next in 1866-67, and now in 1870-71. Measles in 1856, 1860-61, 1864, 1868-69. Scarlet fever in 1855-56, 1859-60, 1863, 1865, and very seriously in 1869. Whooping cough in 1858, 1861-62, 1866 and 1869. Fever in 5 1856, 1860, 1862, and slightly in 1864, 1865, and 1866. The mortality from fever has been more uniform than either of the other diseases, as Hackney has not suffered from it to so great an extent as adjacent districts. The tendency of these diseases to become epidemic every fourth year is very striking, and may arise, to a great extent, from the rarity with which second attacks occur in the same individual; so that after an epidemic there would be fewer persons capable of infection, than after a lapse of two or three years. I must not be supposed, in making these observations, to throw any doubt on the good results which must necessarily follow the removal of nuisances, but I do so to prevent discredit being thrown on sanitary operations, by more good being expected from them than they can effect. The number of births registered during the year was in excess of any former year, viz., 4,029 against 3,913 in 1869, and 3,776 in 1868. I may mention here, that the number of deaths and births are for 52 weeks in each year, and, therefore, not strictly correct, but as the same number of days are included in each year, the totals are correct for comparing one with the other. Table I. 1870.—Births in each Sub-District. 52 Weeks. Quarters. Stoke Newingtn. Stamford Hill. West Hackney. Hackney. South Hackney. Totals. First 63 65 280 374 279 1061 Second 65 42 239 390 244 980 Third 55 48 255 401 248 1007 Fourth 73 40 225 370 273 981 Totals 256 195 999 1535 1044 4029 Per ccntages 6.4 4.8 24.8 38.1 25.9 100 The largest number of births were registered in the first quarter of the year, and the smallest in the second. The largest number of births happened in Hackney sub-district, viz., 1535, 6 or 38.1 per cent. of the whole number. There were 1044 or 25.9 per cent. in South Hackney; 999 or 24.8 per cent. in West Hackney; 256 or 6'4 per cent. in Stoke Newington, and 195 or 4.8 per cent. in Stamford Hill sub-districts. There were 585 deaths under one year old registered during the year, showing a death rate of 145 per 1000 of all the births registered, against 163 per 1000 for all London, and 183 for 17 large towns. This is very favourable, as in no one of the 17 large towns, was so small a rate registered, and as there is no better test of a good sanitary condition of a district, than a small death rate amongst infants. Of course the death rate of infants will not be so large in a wealthy as in a poor district, even if they are equal in salubrity, because the infants of the wealthier classes are not exposed to those privations which prove so fatal to poor children.

The excessive mortality during the early and latter part of this year, was partly caused by the unusual number of deaths from scarlet fever, but chiefly from diseases of the respiratory organs. Of the total deaths, no less than 1123, or 45.6 per cent. were registered in Hackney sub-district. This excessive proportion 7 of deaths to births, occurs from the German Hospital, East London Union, and Hackney Union being included in this sub-district. There were 569 or 23.l per cent. registered in South Hackney; 500, or 20.3 per cent. iu Hackney; 169, or 6.8 per cent. in Stoke Newington; and 103, or 4 2 per cent. in Stamford Hill sub-districts.

Population 8.0 5.4 22.8 39.1 24.7 Deaths 7.8 4.7 23.2 38.0 26.3 The populations of the sub-districts given above, have been calculated from the census just taken. For comparing the population with the deaths in different sub-districts, the percentages are those of the whole population, less the inmates of the Hackney and City of London Unions and the German Hospital. A similar plan has been adopted with the deaths, for it would have given erroneous results to have calculated the death rate of the Hackney sub-district, including all the deaths in these Institutions, because the death rate of the whole district was about 2 per cent., and in these Institutions more than 20 per cent. The table shows that the death rate was below the average in Stoke Newington, Stamford Hill, and Hackney subdistricts, and above it in West Hackney, and especially in South Hackney These results are similar to those obtained in 1860 and 1861, having been but little affected by the increased number of inhabitants in South Hackney or in Hackney. 8 Table IV.

The deaths from epidemic diseases, were no less than 534, or 21.6 per cent. of the whole mortality. This is above the average of the previous ten years, which was 208 per cent. only. The excess of deaths was caused chiefly by diarrhœa, which is fatal almost in proportion to the mean temperature of July and August. In 1870, the temperature of June was 1½ degrees and of July 4 degrees above the average, and there was also very little rain to cleanse the back yards of the houses, the courts and the sewers, so that the heat acted more prejudicially than usual. The deaths from tubercular diseases varied but little from the average, 412 deaths, or 16.7 per cent. of the whole, happened from these causes, against the mean of 16.6 per cent. Diseases of the nervous system were fatal in 294 cases, or 11.9 per cent., against the average of 13.0 per cent. The deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs were decidedly smaller than I should have expected, as the temperature in December was lower than that of the corresponding month in any year of this century, with the exception of 1840, 9 1844, and 1846. There were 392 in number, or only 15.9 per cent., against the average of 16.3. The deaths from the other groups of diseases differed so little in number from those of former years, as not to require any special comment, except that deaths from violence, whether accidental or otherwise, were decidedly below the average. As regards the mortality from epidemic diseases, there is no doubt that we shall have a larger proportion registered in this district now, in consequence of the opening of the Small Pox and Fever Hospital, as many deaths from these causes have not hitherto been registered here, but in Islington. At the same time, allowance has been made for deaths in hospitals, in making the corrections for calculating the death rate for the district, so that they have not escaped notice altogether.

There seems to have been some unknown atmospheric cause in action to have produced the singular prevalence of epidemic diseases 10 during the years of 1869, 1870 and 1871; as in 1869, measles, scarlet fever, and whooping cough were epidemic; in 1870, measles were slightly, scarlet fever and diarrhoea extensively prevalent. This is unusual, for when one disease causes an excessively large mortality, the number of deaths from other diseases are generally not only proportionately, hut absolutely less than usual. The mortality from whooping cough and fever were decidedly below the average, which might have been expected, as whooping cough was very prevalent in 1869. Although this death rate is large, yet it is much below that for all London, as there were only 37 per 10,000 inhabitants against 55 in the Metropolis at large. Table VI.

This is a little below the rate for all London, which was 23.9 per cent. On comparing, however, the per centage of deaths under one year, to births registered, we obtain a much more favorably result, as there were only 585 of these deaths out of 4029 births, or at the rate of 14.5 per cent., to 16.3 per cent. for all London, and 18.3 for 17 large towns. The rate of deaths under one year to births, varied in 1870 very considerably in large towns, the lowest having been Sunderland, where it was only 15.0 per cent., and the highest Liverpool, where it was 25.9 per cent., or more than one quarter 11 of all the births registered. This excessive rate may be partly explained by great prevalence of zymotic diseases, as the largest death rate from those causes occurred in Liverpool, and next in Bristol, Leicester and Bradford. It is, however, very probable, that not nearly all the births were registered in Liverpool, and the calculated proportion between the two is incorrect. There is indeed so much difficulty in making reliable comparisons of the death rates of different districts for sanitary purposes, that I rarely contrast the mortality in Hackney with any other standard than that of London. There were registered 376 deaths of children, above 1 and under 5, or 15.3 per cent.; 147 deaths of children more than 5 and less than 15, or 5.9 per cent.; between the ages of 15 and 25, only 126 deaths, or only 5.3 per cent. were registered. This was the smallest of any duennial period of life, except between 85 and 95, and at this latter age, I need scarcely observe, that the number of deaths were very small, because the number of living were also extremely small. Between 25 and 35 there were 178 deaths, or 7.2 per cent.; between 35 and 45 there were 176 deaths, or 7.1 per cent.; between 45 and 55 there were 193 deaths, or 7.9 per cent.; between 55 and 65 there were 189 deaths, or 7.8 per cent. The age at which the largest proportion of adult deaths were registered was between 65 and 75, when there were 261, or 10.6 per cent.; and the number became much smaller between 75 and 85, when it was 172, or 6.9 per cent., being nearly the same as between 25 and 45. There were no less than 58 persons who died at the advanced age of 85-95, and 3 who lived for 95 years and upwards. The cases of overcrowding which have come under our notice during the year, have not been so numerous as they formerly were, but there were several in which not only too many persons were found in a room, but in which grown-up persons, of different sexes, occupied the same sleeping apartment. Thus, in John Street, Cambridge Heath, the grandfather, grandmother, 13 husband and wife, with four children lived and slept in a room only large enough for two adults and one child. In Queen's road, Homerton, a family consisting of the husband and wife, a daughter of 23, a son of 15, and two children under 12 lived and slept in a room large enough only for two adults and a child. At 16, Urban's Place, Sheep Lane, the mother, a son of 18, two daughters of 16 and 14, and four children under 12 years of age were discovered living and sleeping in a room which ought to have been used by two adults only—the size of the room being 10 feet long, 9 feet 8 inches wide, and 9 feet 9 inches high. At Pratt's Place, Homerton, the husband, wife, and two grown-up daughters, each having an illegitimate child, lived and slept in one small room. In another house in the same Place, the father, mother, a son 25, a daughter 23, and two children under 12 lived and slept in a room containing only 1005 cubic feet of air. In a very small room in Brook Street, Homerton, there were found sleeping, the husband, wife, a son of 25 years, and a man lodger of 23 years old. In another in Templar road, the husband, wife, two young women, one a lodger, and a boy of 13, lived and slept—this room was only large enough for two adults. Another bad case was discovered in Wharf road, where the father, mother, a son of 20, a daughter of 17, and two under 12 years, lived and slept in a room, the cubic capacity of which was 1208 feet. These and other bad instances of overcrowding, amounting in all to 34, were discovered by an inspection made under the powers of the Sanitary Act, 1860. As no less than 6193 houses were examined, the cases of overcrowing cannot be considered to have been very large, although many were very flagrant. The sanitary work performed during the year was extremely large, as no less than 7964 premises were inspected, of which, 6657 were examined under the Sanitary Act, without complaint previously received; 486 in consequence of complaints made to mo or to the inspectors; and 267 from information received that 13 epidemic diseases had occurred therein. A large number of the nuisances complained of consisted of choked or defective drains, or of accumulations of manure and other filth, and a considerable number of these nuisances were discovered on inspection. I append a list of streets inspected, showing that in 6193 houses there were 25043 rooms occupied for living or sleeping in, many for other purposes. This number includes, this year, rooms used as kitchens, and more or less as living rooms. There were 9266 families and 36567 inmates dwelling in the 6193 houses, and 3223 nuisances were discovered on these premises by the inspection. This shows the great necessity for the Sanitary Act, as previously to 1866 the officers of the Board had no power to examine premises unless they had good reason for believing that a nuisance existed thereon. The kind of nuisances which have been abated during the past year by your officers, are set out in the appendix, and may be summed up as follows:—391 consisted of choked drains, 262 of undrained or badly drained yards, and 324 of premises where the traps were wanting or defective, making, with five cesspools drained, 1011 nuisances from defective drainage. The number of houses which required cleansing, whitewashing, and repairing (for defective roofs, &c.), was unusually large, viz., 2388; of yards requiring new paving, or repair of paving 326; of houses in which the water supply was defective 70; and to which there were no dust-bins, 386, making an aggregate, with those in which there were defective drainage, of 4187; so that almost one fifth of the whole number of houses in the district were, on examination, found wanting in some of the requirements necessary for the comfort and well-being of the inhabitants. The inspection of cow sheds and slaughter houses occupied a considerable time, as the Committee, accompanied by myself and Mr. Jones, inspected the whole 171 at least once, and as several were opposed, these were visited two or three times. They also attended at the Petty Sessions, held at Preseott Street, on two 14 occasions, so that eight whole days were occupied on this work alone. The superintendence of the dust removal, occupied a very much larger amount of time than usual, as the value of dust fell very considerably during the year, and there were consequently more requests for removal than in former years, no less than 2483 communications having been received and forwarded to the dust contractors in this year alone. An inspection of greengrocers', poulterers', and fishmongers' yards, numbering more than 200, was made at least once, and in some, more frequently. An inspection, also, of 117 bakehouses was efficiently carried out, and a number of notices were issued for the removal of nuisances. These premises were, however, found in a better state this year than previously, and there is no doubt, that the greater care and cleanliness now observed in carrying on these businesses assist in keeping the mortuary rate at its present low standard. The measuring of all the rooms of small houses in this district, still occupies spare time at the end and beginning of each year. 464 houses were measured, the cubio capacity of each room therein calculated, and entered in the Register, the number of inmates who may legally occupy the rooms fixed by me, and notices then served on the owner and occupier of each. There are a good many not yet measured, but I hope the Register will be completed during next winter. The serving of these notices is important, as it brings the houses within the provisions of the 35th section of the Sanitary Act, and empowers the inspectors to enter and examine the premises at any hour, if he has good reason for believing them to be overcrowded, whilst under the Nuisances Removal Acts, the houses must be examined between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., unless a trade be carried on therein. The number of houses disinfected, and afterwards cleansed and white-washed, in consequence of the occurrence of epidemic diseases, 267, which was less than in 1869, in consequence of the 15 great diminution of scarlatinal cases, indeed, it was less than in any year since 1866. This would have been very satisfactory, if an epidemic of small pox had not begun at the end of the year, but as before stated, epidemics must, under present circumstances, be expected, at or about their usual periods of recurrence. The number of notices served during the year have been very large, as no less than 1296 lodging house, 3594 preliminary, 2064 peremptory, and 574 statutory notices were issued from this office, making a total of 7528, against 6653 in 1869. There was a greater number of summonses issued, than usual, viz., 96. Many of these were of considerable importance. In one case, I took out a summons against an undertaker for removing, without previous disinfection, a coffin in an open cart, after it had been for some time in the room of a person who had died from small pox. The magistrate dismissed the summons, and expressed his regret that the law compelled him to do so. Summonses were taken out for the abatement of two of the overcrowding cases, described in this report, and orders for its abatement obtained. A summons was taken out against Mr. Davy, for burning a very offensive matter, known as dead oil, when Mr. Davy discontinued it. Another summons was taken out against Mr. Harrison, for not using the best practicable means for preventing his business from being a nuisance to the neighbourhood. Summonses were also taken out, and orders obtained, against two dust contractors and scavengers, for allowing accumulations to remain on their premises so as to become a nuisance, and injurious to the health of the neighbourhood. A person was also summoned for not having made his drains in accordance with the order of the Board, and was fined one pound; but a summons against the same person for cutting off his neighbour's drain, and causing a nuisance on his neighbour's premises was dismissed. Several summonses for the illegal keeping of pigs, for dilapidated premises, etc., were decided in favor of the Board. 16 The question as to closing of West Hackney Churchyard entirely, was considered in March last, by the Medical Officer of Graveyards and myself, when it was decided in the presence of the Vicar and the Churchwardens, that burials might be allowed there, if the order in Council as to family graves was strictly carried out, but not otherwise. There is a good deal of space still unoccupied there, so that if due care be used, this churchyard will not be entirely closed for years. The number of bodies deposited in the mortuary was less than usual, viz., 27 only. Of these 13 deaths occurred from drowning, 2 from accidents, 2 from fever, and 2 from small pox. There were also brought there, the bodies of 7 newly-born children, and of one adult, found dead, from natural causes. I cannot conclude my report, without stating the efficient manner in which the inspectors and sub-inspector have performed their duties. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, JOHN W.
