To the Right Worshipful the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Mr. Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors,— I—INTRODUCTION. I have the honour to present to you the Fifty-first Annual Report upon the vital and sanitary condition of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Although the Registration District of St. Pancras has remained practically the same area since 1856, except for a few adjustments of boundary described in the Report for the year 1900, the changes in the areas of the Registration Sub-Districts since the last mentioned date have been great. Changes were made in 1900, at the Census of 1901, and again in 1906, when the two southern Sub-Districts were amalgamated. So that now the four Registration Sub-Districts of St. Pancras, except for slight deviations of the outer boundary, coincide with the four Parliamentary Divisions. METEOROLOGICAL RECORDS. Here follow the Meteorological Records for the year as deduced from observations made at Greenwich and at Camden Square. 10 METEOROLOGICAL TABLE FOR SAINT PANCRAS, 1906.

When first inquiring into the subject of Infantile Mortality I pointed out the enormous delay that took place in the registration of births, and in May, 1905, a table of the number of births registered in the previous four quarters was drawn up showing the delay in weeks, which table was printed and circulated at the time*. At the Conference on the Prevention of Infantile Mortality held in St. Pancras Town Hall on the 5th June, 1905, a resolution was passed— "That it is desirable that births should be registered within five days of their "occurrence, as is required in the case of deaths by the Births and Deaths "Registration Acts, and be not delayed for six weeks or longer as now by law "permitted." Later on this resolution was sent to the Local Government Board. In the meanwhile the London County Council made arrangements for midwives to notify the births attended by them during each week, and to make lists of these births and forward them to the respective Council of the Boroughs in which they occurred. The result of the working of this system shows that during the year 1906 of 5,744 births registered, the majority within two months of their occurrence, 1,034 were notified by midwives, the majority within two weeks of their occurrence, that is, the proportion notified by midwives as compared with the total number registered was about 18 per cent., so that about 82 per cent. of the births arc unaffected by the arrangements made with midwives. On the 12th December, 1906, I reported as follows to the Public Health Committee:— It is within the knowledge of your Committee that resolutions have been passed at the meetings of Public Authorities and at Conferences urging the earlier registration or notification of births. * This table also appeared in the Annual Report of the M. O. H. for 1905, page 25. 25 The Registrar-General, Sir William C. Dunbar, Hart., c.B., in his 67th Annual Report for the year 1904, the last issued, under the heading of final remarks, page xlix., expressed an opinion which bears directly on the recommendation forwarded to the Local Government Hoard by the Borough Council at the end of last year, to the effect that the Local Government Board be urged to promote legislation providing that births must be registered within five days of their occurrence, as is required in the case of deaths by the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, to obviate the present delay of many weeks and even of months. The Registrar-General's opinion is to the effect that—"After serious con"sideration of the situation as it presents itself to me, I have come to the "conclusion that, whilst it would be unwise at present to disturb the "existing organisation of birth registration, a well devised system of early "notification of births—legalised and worked in conjunction with the present registration system on the one hand, and with sanitary administration on the "other—might, along with other motive forces, serve as a most effective and "lasting barrier with which to stem the tide of Infant Mortality." The Huddersfield Corporation recently obtained statutory powers to enforce under a penalty the notification of every birth occurring in the Borough within forty-eight hours after the occurrence, and a provision is made to pay one shilling for each such notification, the notification to be made by the father or person in attendance upon the mother. The St. Pancras Borough Council resolved to adopt tentatively a system of voluntary notification of births during a period of three months, and to pay to the father, or, failing him, to the doctor, midwife, or other person attending upon the mother, the sum of one shilling for notifying a birth within forty-eight hours of its occurrence in the Borough. The notification commenced on the 19th August, and the thirteen weeks of the quarter of the year terminated on Saturday the 17th November. During the thirteen weeks, 304 notifications of births were received. Of these, 66 were notified by doctors, 150 by midwives, 35 by institution officers, 15 by women friends or helps, and 38 by fathers and other relatives. Of these 304 notifications, 5 were found to be just outside the St. Pancras boundary, and are therefore excluded, the total number of notifications being 299. The social condition of the families in which the notified births occurred may be judged by the number of rooms in the dwellings and the occupations of the fathers. As to the number of rooms, 55 families occupied one room, 124 occupied two rooms, 48 occupied three rooms, 12 occupied four rooms (but 4 of the families included other relatives), 4 occupied more than four rooms (but 1 of the families included other relatives), and the remaining 35 were either in public institutions or service. As to the occupations of the fathers, 67 were labourers, 25 carmen, 14 painters, 13 horsekeepers, 14 railway porters, 10 pianoforte workmen, 10 cab drivers, 6 printers, 6 door porters, 6 coalmen, (3 factory hands, 5 milkmen, 5 potmen, making 187 in the foregoing, and in addition a large number of similar occupations of which there were 4, 3, 2, or 1 each. 26 The fees of voluntary notification during the thirteen weeks of the quarter of the year have been under £15. The uses of early notification are:— (i) That within two or three days of birth a card of advice can be sent to every mother, and, when notified by the father or by a woman friend or help, this can be followed up in a day or two by the personal advice of the Visitor, and, when notified by the doctor or midwife, this visit can be deferred till the tenth or twelfth day or paid sooner upon their request, especially in poverty-stricken cases, when the visitor may be the means of temporarily procuring food for a half fed mother from a private individual, the Clergy, a Charitable Society, or a Relieving Officer, and the bailiffs may be kept away at least until the mother can get about without the risk of losing her breast milk. (ii) That visits can be paid to the mother and infant before removal and change of address takes place, and cases can be followed up. (iii) That early visits to see the "new baby" are readily accepted by mothers as a natural thing, later on a certain amount of explanation is necessary, and the Visitor's difficulties are increased. In conclusion, the general opinion is that the first step in the prevention of infantile mortality is the earliest possible notification of births, whatever opinion may be expressed as to the best method to adopt in order to carry this out. Following the line adopted by Alderman Broadbent, when Mayor of Huddersfield, in Marvlebone, Sir Thomas Brook Hitching, the Mayor, is offering to present a sovereign to the parents (earning less than £2 a week) of every child reaching the first anniversary of its birthday alive. The essence of this again is the early notification of births. Your Committee might with advantage recommend the Borough Council to again urge the Prime Minister, the President of the Local Government Board, and the Registrar-General to promote legislation to provide that births be registered within 5 days of their occurrence, as is required in the case of deaths by the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, in order to obviate the present delay of many weeks and even of months. After four weeks extension of time the experimental period of the voluntary notification of births came to an end, and the Borough Council did not again urge the promotion of legislation to provide for the earlier registration of births. Since then a Bill has been introduced into the House of Commons by Lord Robert Cecil to provide for the Notification of Births within forty-eight hours of their occurrence. 27 Action taken during the Year. During the year the action taken with regard to the prevention of the mortality of suckling infants is summarised as follows:— W. S. E. N. . Total Births registered (majority within 2 months) 1397 1139 1737 1471 5744 Births on Midwives Lists (within 2 weeks) 244 175 168 447 1034 Voluntary Notifications (within 2 days)* 76 40 109 142 367 * During only 17 weeks in the latter half of the year. Addresses.—"Not known" 73 "Removed" 83 "Found correct 1126 Total 1282 Visits. —Total number 1869 Inquiries made 1126 Additional visits 743 The mother of every one of the 5,744 infants horn has also received a card of advice, setting out the method and mode of promoting breast feeding. These efforts have been reinforced by the medical practitioners, midwives, and nurses practising in St. Pancras. Comparison of the past three years. The total mortality of infants under one year of age per thousand births has been during the last three years 1516, 135.7, and 131.1. This is a steady reduction, and will bear closer analysis. In the following table is set out the mortality of infants under one year during each of the quarters of the past three years in England and Wales, the 76 large towns, 142 smaller towns, London, and St. Pancras, together with the monthly 4 ft. earth temperature and rainfall. In this table it will be seen that in the third or summer quarter of the year, which is the crucial period of infant mortality, a remarkable diminution has taken place in St. Pancras during the past two years, that is, since the St. Pancras scheme has been in full working. This table shows — 1.—That the Infantile Mortality Rate of St. Pancras during the summer quarter of 1905, as compared with the same quarter of l904, fell from 24 per 1,000 above to 4 per 1000 above that of London, and in the 28 same quarter of the following year fell to 15 per 1,000 below that of London. As compared with the 76 large towns in the third quarter of the year, the London Infantile Mortality fell from 3 per 1,000 above in 1904, to 11 per 1,000 below in 1905, and to 37 per 1,000 below in 1906. As compared with England and Wales in the same quarter the London mortality fell from 42 above to 22 above between 1904 and 1905, and in 1906 fell to 4 below that of England and Wales. This fall by comparison becomes more significant when it is borne in mind that during this same period measures for the prevention of infantile mortality have been taken in many localities. 2.—That, comparing the last three summers, although the temperature increased in each succeeding year, and the rainfall diminished in each succeeding year, yet the infant mortality in St. Pancras was lower each summer than the preceding summer. 3.—That during the warm dry summer of 1906, compared with that of 1965, the infantile mortality of England and Wales rose 21 per 1,000, of the 76 great towns 23 per 1,000, of the 142 smaller towns 31 per 1,000, and of London 16 per 1,000, whereas that of St. Pancras fell 3 per 1,000. The measures pursued in St. Pancras have been the discouragement of the artificial feeding of infants of suckling age and the encouragement of natural or breast feeding by prompt advice and the personal influence of Women Inspectors and Women Voluntary Visitors. The efforts tentatively commenced in 1904 were pursued with greater confidence and thoroughness during 1905, and have been extended and elaborated during 1906. It was recognised from the beginning by the Borough Council that woman's sympathy and influence were essential to success. Your Inspector, Miss Bibby, B.A. (Lond), assisted in commencing the inquiry, and Miss Gardiner, B.A. (Lond.), assisted in elaborating the inquiry and the remedial work, and the numerous ladies (some twenty) kindly acting as voluntary visitors have assisted in extending the work. The members of the medical, midwifery, and nursing professions have fully approved and furthered the principles of the scheme adopted by the Borough Council. The interesting point to bear in mind is that the lowering of the infantile mortality has been accomplished without the municipal distribution of milk, the Borough Council not having established a milk depot, and no such depot existing in the Borough, and the fall in the mortality rates must be mainly attributed to the diminished use of cow's milk for infants and the increase of breast feeding. 29 Infantile Mortality Rates per 1000 Births. 1904. 1905. 1906.

In the Journal of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health— "Public Health" —for April, 1907, p. 408, under the heading of "Diseases producing infant mortality," will be found the following annotation:— "We turn to Dr. Tatham's letter to the Registrar General for accurate information on this subject. It is noteworthy that one-fifth of the total loss of life in infancy occurs in the first week of extra-uterine life, a fact which tends to moderate our hopes of affecting one-fifth of the total infant mortality, unless it be by measures affecting the mother during pregnancy. Urban infant mortality is 30 per cent. in excess of rural; the excess of urban over rural mortality is only 6 per cent. in the first week of life, while it is over 50 per cent. in the later months of the first year. Half of this excess is due to diarrhœal diseases, one-eighth to premature birth and congenital defects, one-eighth to pneumonia, and smaller proportions to tuberculous diseases, bronchitis, &c. These important facts bring us face to face with the conclusion that the chief way to diminish infant mortality is to prevent epidemic diarrhoea." Infantile mortality in the third or summer quarter of the year is said to be governed by climatic conditions, so that the mortality is high when the temperature is excessive and the rainfull is deficient. Excessive temperature leads to the rapid decomposition of dead organic substances, which means the rapid multiplication of living micro-organisms. Deficient rainfall means the drying of surfaces, the creation of dust, and the liberation of micro-organisms to be wafted and spread by the air and by insects of the air over food. The one and only food for babies is milk, and the effect of milk loaded with microbes, or decomposed, or stale, upon a baby is to cause abdominal disorder, which manifests itself as diarrhoea with or without vomiting. So that in the summer or third quarter of the year amongst hand-fed babies there is an excessive mortality from abdominal diseases, typified by diarrhoea. To prevent this as far as possible, the milk provided for babies must be absolutely fresh, free from microbes, and protected against the access of microbes. The only milk that is at all times in this condition is the milk contained in the human breast. Therefore, the supreme remedy against the mortality of babies from summer diarrhoea is breast-feeding. In St. Pancras the procedure has been to make every effort to obtain and maintain breast-feeding during the suckling period of the first year of life, and especially to maintain it through the summer months or third quarter of the year. The effect of this procedure upon the mortality is shown in the two following tables, the one showing the 76 large towns and the other the 29 City and Metropolitan Boroughs, arranged in order of merit, commencing with the lowest, during the third quarter of the years 1904, 1905, and 1906. By adopting this method we get rid of the difficulty of varying temperature in different years, as instead of comparing one summer with another, we compare one place with another in the same summer. It will be observed in the tables that of the 76 large towns in the summer of 1904 St. Pancras was 40th, in 1905 was 34th, and in 1906 was 16th. Of the 29 City and Boroughs of London, St. Pancras was 25th in the summer of 1904, 18th in 1905, and 13th in 1906. The progress is steadily marked. 31 INFANTILE MORTALITY. 76 LARGE TOWNS. 3rd Quarters of 1904, 1905, 1906. (Uncorrected for Public Institutions.) Order of least Mortality. 1904.

If we compare the ages at which infants under one year of age have been dying during each of the last three years, some further interesting results appear. The two tables below show the total number of deaths of infants, not during the summer only, but during the whole of each of the years 1904, 1905, and 1906. It will be seen in the first table that, dividing the ages at death into two sixmonthly periods and comparing 1904 with 1906, there was an increase of about 1.5 per cent. of the total deaths in the latter year during the second half ot the year and a corresponding decrease during the first half, showing that not only is the total number of deaths diminishing, but also that those which take place are occurring later than in the former year. Dividing the ages at deaths into three-monthly periods, it will be further seen that there was a diminution in 1906 of about 4.3 per cent. in the first three-monthly period of age and an increase of about 4.4 per cent. in the second trimestre of life. Dividing the ages at death into monthly periods, as shown in the second table below, and comparing 1906 with 1904, it will be seen that whereas in the second month the diminution of mortality is about 2.3 per cent. of the total deaths for the year, in the first month the diminution is about 4.5 per cent. Dividing the first month into fortnightly periods and comparing 1906 with 1904, the proportionate mortality was about the same in the second half, but in the first it diminished some 4⅓ per cent. calculated upon the total deaths for the year. Again, dividing the first fortnight into two weeks and making similar comparisons, whereas there is a diminution of about 1 per cent. of deaths in the second week, there is a diminution of about 2 par cent. in the first week of the first year of life. So that, in addition to a markedly reduced infantile mortality as a whole, not only are fewer deaths of infants per 1,000 births taking place in St. Pancras, but also those infants that die are dying at a later period. In other words, infant life is being prolonged all along the line of age, and this of course is most marked at the youngest age.

Coming to the causes of deaths of infants we are on less secure ground statistically, because it is often extremely difficult to diagnose the actual cause of death in an infant, and because infants die less frequently from organic disease than functional disturbance or decline. I shall, therefore, not attempt to compare the causes of deaths or draw conclusions from them. Conclusion. The reason for the reduction of infant mortality in St. Pancras is, in my opinion, due to an increase in breast-feeding. It is extremely difficult to demonstrate this in figures, but inquiries indicate that maternal functions are being better fulfilled, and the constantly re-iterated advice to thousands of mothers to breast feed must be having this salutary effect. John F. J. Sykes, Medical Officer of Health. REPORT OF THE WOMAN INSPECTOR. Health Department, Town Hall, March 6th, 1907. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, During the year 1906, the work done in connection with the efforts to lessen the Infantile Mortality of St. Pancras, has continued on the same lines as shewn at some length, in my report to you for the year 1905. In addition, certain new departures have been made, and fresh schemes adopted, with a view of not only diminishing the death-rate of Infants under 12 months, but also of improving the general health and condition of those who survive. All the various measures (e.g. Distribution of Advice cards; Personal visits to Mothers; the referring of Mothers and Infants to Doctors, Hospitals, Charitable agencies, etc., for Medical advice and nourishment), so strongly urged by you, with the object of inducing and prolonging natural feeding, and discouraging artificial feeding—all these means adopted, seem to be 36 having the desired effect; and as corroborative of anything that statistics may prove (see Tables A, B, C), it is very evident to us, who are constantly visiting homes where there is a baby, that it is now becoming well ingrained in the mothers mind that natural feeding, wherever possible, is the most desirable one; that nourishing food for the prospective, and "nursing" mother is essential, and that premature weaning is to be avoided. Voluntary Visitors.—By means of the help of voluntary visitors, during some parts of the year, it was possible to visit more babies, and to carry out more measures consequent upon these visits than could otherwise have been done. Not only did Miss Neville and Miss Stewart undertake to have a certain number of cases visited by the C. 0. S. workers each week, but also several fully-qualified Sanitary Inspectors (Mrs. Barnes, Miss Anderson and Miss Kanthack, Hospital Sister and Midwife, and in December, Miss Johnson), gave valuable assistance in the work. Miss Kanthack also delivered a course of six lectures, on "The Preservation of Infant Life," to the voluntary workers, at meetings which I held weekly, fortnightly, or monthly during the year according to season. Mode of Visiting.—It has always been my object to ensure that the visit to the mothers and infants should not be hurried ones and merely involving a long series of questions, but that they should be made in a leisurely, tactful, and sympathetic manner, so that subsequent visits, if necessary, should be welcome; and again that good work and lasting results should be our aim rather than a large show of numbers visited in a perfunctory manner. Thus in 1906:— Number of Births, Visits, Adrict Cards, etc. Total Births registered majority within 2 months) 5744 Births on Midwives' List (within 2—4 weeks 1034 Voluntary Notifications (within two days) 367 Advice Cards sent, after and previous to birth (about) 7000 Actual number of Infants visited 1126 Number of visits paid 1869 Additional visits to Infants* 143 Infants "not known" at address given73 Infants "removed" from district 83 156 Extra visits in connection with Infants' work made by myself to Hospitals, Doctors, Midwives, Nurses; Almoners, Charity Organization Society, Relieving Officers, Clergy, Maternity Missions, Labour Bureau, Dairy Shops, Chemists, etc. 300 Numerous complaints met with in the course of inquiry, and at request of mothers were dealt with, and the necessary measures taken to abate nuisances and remedy sanitary defects. Record ot' Births, Deaths and Visits.—Indexes have been kept of all deaths of infants under 12 months, and of all births on the Registrars' returns; and an index of the births on the Midwives' lists is also being made, so that by a comparison of the two latter it may be easier to avoid a duplication of inquiry visits, etc., to the same infant. 37 In the indexes a mark is put against houses where two or more births or deaths have occurred, so that in case there should be a suspiciously large number at any one house, further investigations may be made. Quarterly reports have been made as to the number of infants enquired after and additional visits, etc., also the inquiry forms of all infants visited have been arranged into separate quarters so that they may be referred to more easily and details of subsequent visits added, the voluntary workers generally passing on to me cases presenting any special difficulty, when a 2nd, 3rd, or 4th, visit may be necessary. Voluntary Notification of Births.—As regards the voluntary notification of births, within two days, which was in force for four months of the year (August 19th, to December loth), I have already submitted a full report of this to you. Taking into consideration all that was able to be effected as a result of this early notification (in the matter of sending off Advice ('ards immediately after receiving the notification of birth, and of making personal visits before natural feeding had been discontinued and artificial feeding begun), it is a matter of extreme regret (having regard to the lessening of Infantile Mortality) that the registration of all births within a few days should not be compulsory, especially as it would bring us into contact with certain classes of nurses and helps who require instruction in more recent methods. Workhouse Cases.—Since August, the births that have taken place in the St. Pancras Workhouse have been notified to the Health Department within two days, and in each instance an Advice Card has at once been sent in an envelope directed to the mother, and at intervals I (and sometimes one of the voluntary visitors), have paid a visit to the Maternity Ward, and have thus had the opportunity of seeing the mother and baby there, and of explaining the importance of the Advice Card, so that when advisable and possible, we may visit these infants (mainly illegitimate) in their subsequent homes. Infant Mortality in St. Pancran.—Hitherto in St. Pancras, in the attempt to lessen the general death-rate amongst infants, the main object has been to strike at the root of the principal cause of high infantile mortality, viz., epidemic, zymotic or summer diarrhoea (occurring chiefly during July, August, and September), by promoting throughout the whole year all possible means for bringing about natural feeding and discouraging hand-feeding. But in addition to this it seems that other factors need to be taken into account. Visiting the cases as we do, not only during the summer, but all the year round, and examining carefully week by week, winter as well as summer, the causes of infantile deaths in the death returns, one is constantly confronted with the fact of the large amount of illness and high number of deaths from:— (1) Bronchitis and Pneumonia, during the winter months. (2) Premature Births. And so the problem has to be seriously faced, as to how one can also strike at the root of the causes of these, at the same time as, and hand in hand with, the attempts to lessen "Epidemic" Diarrhœa. 38 The attached table shews the actual number of deaths, and also the proportion per 1,000 deaths amongst infants (under 12 months old) in St. Pancras, during the years 1905 and 190G, from:— (1) Diarrhœal diseases. (2) Bronchitis and Pneumonia. (3) Premature Birth. (4) All other causes combined. The proportions show at a glance, that though Diarrhoea is responsible for the largest number of deaths amongst infants, yet Bronchitis and Pneumonia, and Premature Birth, are also important factors that must not be disregarded.

The tables 1906, 1905, and 1904, are only truly comparable, when the percentage of the total of each month (and not of the whole year) is taken, and even then, only when there is a sufficiently large number under consideration each month. Thus the figures under 2—3 months, in 1906, 1905, and 1904, may be regarded as truly comparable. I am, Sir, Yours obediently, Blanche Gardiner, Sanitary Inspector. 39 Al. 1906.

On the 13th and 14th June, a National Conference on the Prevention of Infantile Mortality was held at Caxton Hall, Westminster, under the Presidency of the Rt. Hon. John Burns, M.P., President of the Local. Government Hoard. At this Conference the following resolutions, which I have re-classified under their several headings, were passed:— INFANTILE MORTALITY CONFERENCE. London, 13th and 14th June, 1906. Resolutions Passed. A.—Births. 1.—That notification of all births be given within 48 hours to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which they occur. 2.—That, in view of the information submitted, the Conference is of opinion that all still births should be notified within 48 hours to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which they occur, and that no burial should take place without a medical certificate. B.—Mothers. 1.—That no employer of labour shall permit a woman advanced in pregnancy to engage in factory labour unless her ability therefor has been certified to the satisfaction of the Local Authority. 2.—That the period of one month's abstention from factory work away from home now imposed upon mothers be extended to at least three months, and that, on their return to work, evidence must be produced satisfactory to the Local Authority that proper provision has been made for the care of the child. C.—Infants. 1.—That, having regard to the ascertained fact that in centres of industries where women are largely employed away from their homes an excessive number of deaths of infants take place, and that this is contributed to by the improper conditions existing at the houses in which infants are placed out to nurse, it is necessary that the persons by whom, and the places into which, infants are received, should be under supervision by the Local Sanitary Authority. 2. —That the Infant Life Protection Act be amended to remedy abuses which are not at present provided against. 3.—That, in the opinion of this Conference, the question of the insurance of infant lives under twelve months is one demanding serious consideration, and, with a view to receiving reliable information, the Government should be asked to appoint a Departmental Committee of Inquiry on the whole question. D.—Milk. 1.—That, in the opinion of this Conference, immediate legislation is required enabling Sanitary Authorities to establish or support depots for the supply of pure, or modified, or sterilized milk, and to defray any cost out of the monies available for public health purposes. 43 2.—That the Dairies, Milkshops, and Cowsheds Order is defective, and that any amendment should extend the definition of disease as applied to animals, and should make the provision of regulations by local authorities compulsory. That the scope of the Regulations should be extended to cover dirty milk, and should enable Local Authorities to prohibit the sale of any milk which fails to comply with the conditions of purity agreed upon. 3.—That all preparations offered or sold as food for infants should be certified by a Government Analyst as non-injurious, and that each packet should contain its analysis. E.—Schools. That the Education Department be urged to add instruction in Elementary Hygiene with reference to the dietary and rearing of infants to their present scheme for systematically training girls in the senior classes in the practice and principles of personal hygiene and elements of dietary. F.—Midwives. That, in the opinion of this Conference, the Midwives Act, 1902, should be extended to Scotland and Ireland. In a paper contributed by me to the Conference, I ventured to suggest that infants of suckling age should not be admitted to municipal creches and public nurseries, at a distance, as this is a direct encouragement of premature weaning, but that manufacturers who elect to employ the labour of mothers with suckling infants on account of its cheapness should provide, on the premises, cradle-rooms for the infants, and give facilities to the mothers to suckle their infants in the middle of each of the forenoon and afternoon shifts. I also ventured to suggest, that under Sections 79 and 83 of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901, the Home Secretary appeared to have the power to make regulations prohibiting the employment of, or modifying or limiting the period of employment of, any class of person in any manufacture or process certified to be dangerous to health in the case of women, and that if the interpretation of the Act did not give him this power, he should be given the power to make regulations for mothers during the pregnant (after quickening) period and during the suckling period, as to the kind and amount of work that they should be limited to in certain industries and processes, and that this would be preferable to the indiscriminate and total prohibition of women to work during long periods. I have reported upon the notification of births within 48 hours, and also upon the desirability of the bacteriological examination of milk, especially of milk intended for hand-fed infants, both of which courses were unanimously recommended at the Conference held in the Council Chamber of this Town Hall, in June, 1905. On the 26th April, 1906, the Public Health Committee reported, that " instead of establishing milk depots, it is more desirable to arrange for the " bacteriological examination of farmers' milk consigned to the Borough, " especially of milk intended for infants, with a view to controlling the 44 "cleanliness and wholesomeness of the supply. If this be done, in the event "of milk being found to be of an unsatisfactory character, or prejudicial to "health, it will be possible to communicate with farmers, warning them that "the Borough Council is inquiring into the cleanliness and wholesomeness of "milk sent into the Borough, and is considering the best method of preventing "the distribution of milk prejudicial to health, and especially to hand-fed "infants of suckling age," and the Council approved and adopted the following recommendation:— "That samples of the milk consigned to the Borough be "submitted to bacteriological examination, and that your Committee be "instructed to report further as to the number and the cost for the approval of " the Council." The Public Health Committee further recommended — "That during the hot weather, thirty samples of milk be examined bacteriologically, as to (1) the volume of apparent filth, (2) the nature of the filth-presence of debris, pus, blood, streptococci, and tubercle baccilli (3) the degree of acidity, and (4) the number of microbes per C.C. on gelatine at 20°C.—22°C. (60°F.—71.6°F.), in batches of four or five samples at the time, at the cost of one and-a-half guinea per sample." This recommendation was approved and adopted by the Borough Council. An account of the mode and results of sampling and bacteriologically examining Nursery Milks will be found in Part V. of this Report under the head of Food. III.—INFECTIOUS DISEASES. § 1.—DISCOVERY AND DIAGNOSIS. It is well to know that unrecognised cases largely spread infectious diseases. Discovery.—Mild cases of indisposition or disease excite no particular attention, or are attributed to other than the real cause by parents, guardians, or friends, and are not submitted to medical examination. When cases of suspected infectious diseases are discovered there is sometimes considerable difficulty and delay in making an exact medical diagnosis in certain types of the diseases. Here bacteriological and additional clinical examination are brought to bear upon doubtful types, and to check on confirm the diagnosis. Bacteriological Tests.— The number of specimens of secretion, blood and sputum submitted to bacteriological tests during' the year in susnected cases of Diphtheria, Typhoid or Enteric Fever, and Tuberculosis, and the results of examination were as follows:— Bacillus found. Doubtful. Bacillus not found. Total. Diphtheria (Secretion) 30 .. 60 90 45 Reaction obtained. Doubtful. Reaction not obtained. Total. Typhoid (Blood) 29 .. 22 51 Bacillus found. Doubtful. Bacillus not found. Total. Tuberculosis (Sputum) 12 . . 29 41 Infectious Diseases fall into four categories— (a) Permanent compulsorily notifiable diseases, (b) Permanent voluntarily notifiable diseases, (c) Temporary compulsorily notifiable diseases, and (d) Non-notifiable diseases. A BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY. On the 12th September, 1906, the Public Health Committee considered a Report of the Medical Officer of Health on the proposed provision by the London County Council of a Bacteriological Laboratory, which Report was to the following effect:— "A letter dated 14th June last from the Clerk to the London County Council was before your Committee on the 18th July. The letter states that the London County Council require a considerable number of bacteriological examinations to be made, and are considering the establishment of a laboratory with a bacteriologist. The London County Council understands that several Sanitary Authorities in London require bacteriological examinations and that it might reduce the cost of such examinations if a central laboratory were established and maintained at the cost of the London County Council. A further communication has since been received from the Clerk to the London County Council, dated 10th August, stating that it is proposed that the central laboratory should be conducted at the cost of the London County Council and without cost to the Sanitary Authorities. "This proposal really involves two proposals—(1) a bacteriological laboratory for the London County Council, and (z) a bacteriological laboratory for the Borough Council, which may be separate, associated, or conjoint, as the London County Council may think fit. It also involves a further proposition—that if the Borough Council agree to the scheme of the London County Council the Borough Council pledges itself practically not to have a laboratory for the borough and not to send specimens elsewhere for bacteriological examination. "Certain boroughs in London have bacteriological laboratories of their own, which materially expedites the work of examination; others have combined to support a laboratory; others are considering the establishment of laboratories; and others again send specimens to certain, recognised bacteriological institutions. The great advances made in bacteriology in recent years are such 46 that it might be desirable to establish a chemical and bacteriological laboratory directly under the control of the Borough Council, and therefore great circumspection should be used in committing the Council to any scheme as to a laboratory. "With regard to the costs, it would practically be a transference from the borough rates to the county rates, and the price to be paid for this transference would be the loss of control by the Borough Council. Naturally in a laboratory or laboratories established by the London County Council, the London County Council material would take precedencc of that of the Borough Council, and the London County Council would be able to restrict at any moment the amount of examination, to limit the number of specimens and to impose such other conditions as they might desire upon the Borough Council. "There is no suggestion of any joint control by the Borough Council in the communications from the London County Council, and if the St. Pancras Borough Council join the scheme it would be desirable to provide against this entire absence of control by clearly defined conditions. These conditions should be— "(1) That no restrictions be imposed by the London County Council upon the nature of the specimens to be sent and the extent and nature of the examinations to be required by St. Pancras. "(2) That no limit be drawn by the London County Council to the number of specimens from St. Pancras to be examined. "(3) That the full results, both positive and negative, of each examination be immediately reported to the Medical OfEcer of Health of the Borough of St. Pancras. "(4) That the Borough Council would be at liberty to send specimens elsewhere for bacteriological examination, and shall not be precluded from establishing a bacteriological laboratory, with or without a chemical laboratory, for the special service of the borough if it should be considered desirable." The Public Health Committee recommended— That the foregoing report of the Medical Officer of Health be approved and a copy thereof forwarde d to the London County Council, with an expression of opinion that this Council are in favour of the principle of the establishment of a central bacteriological laboratory. On the 19th September, 1906, the Borough Council approved and adopted the report and recommendation. 47 § 2—NOTIFICATION AND DISEASES.

SCARLET FEVER. Towards the end of January an outbreak of scarlet fever occurred at the Park Chapel Schools, Arlington Road, involving some 19 children, the majority of whom sat in group in the same class-room. It was stated that the children of this group played out of school with a child five years of age, living close by, who, it was reported, was convalescent from a recent attack of measles; but it appeared to have been quite probable that this was an unrecognised case of scarlet fever. 51 MEMBRANOUS CROUP. The Hospitals Committee, reporting to the Metropolitan Asylums Board on a memorandum in which attention was called to certain facts connected with delay in the removal of a case to hospital because it was simply certified as suffering from membranous croup without the qualification that it was diphtheritic in nature, said that as far back as 1897 the point as to whether cases of membranous croup should be admitted by the Board was put to the Local Goverment Board, who replied that it was advised "that the term membranous croup per se is not sufficiently definite." In view of all the circumstances the Committee asked the medical superintendents of the fever hospitals whether, having regard to their lengthened experience, cases certified without qualification to be membranous croup ought to be admitted to the Board's hospitals. The whole 11 unanimously expressed the opinion that they ought to be. On the ground of their strong expression of opinion the Committee has issued intructions that persons certified without qualification to be suffering from membranous croup arc to be admitted to the Board's hospitals, and resolved to report the action taken by the Committee to the Local Government Board. SEPTIC DISEASES: ERYSIPELAS. The Septic class of diseases, popularly known as blood-poisoning, includes ervsipelas, pycemia and septicoemia, and puerperal fever. Whereas erysipeles attacks the surfaces, the skin and mucous membranes, and the tissues lying beneath, pyœmia and septicoemia affect the deeper parts and internal organs, the puerperal form commencing in the female pelvis. Pyaemia and Septicwmia.—The difference between pycemia and septicoemia is one of degree, the former referring to a subacute or chronic condition of local septic foci, and the latter to an acute general distribution throughout the body. These diseases are not included amongst the dangerous infectious diseases notifiable to the Medical Officer of Health. Puerperal Fever.—The opinion of the Royal College of' Physicians was sought by the London County Council, in the year 1898, submitting the question: "Whether the diseases peritonitis and metritis, occurring in connection with parturition, as well as puerperal pycemia, puerperal septicoemia, and puerperal saprcemia, all of which the Registrar-General includes under 'puerperal fever' were covered by that term for the purposes of notification." A Committee of the Royal College of Physicians, to whom the question was referred, gave the following reply:— "That this Committee is of opinion that, with a view to the limitation of dangerous infectious diseases, the London County Council would be acting rightly in adopting the view that the expression ' puerperal fever,' as contained in section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, should be taken to include septicoemia, pycemia, septic peritonitis, septic metritis, and other acute septic inflammations in the pelvis occurring as the direct result of child-birth." The Obstetrical Society of London gave a similar reply to a similar question submitted to them by the Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health. 52 Puerperal fever is included amongst the notifiable infectious diseases. Upon 1 lie receipt of a medical certificate notifying a case, (1) enquiry is made at the house as to the circumstances and any possible source of infection; (2) sanitary inspection of the premises is made and the drains tested; (3) the question of the degree of isolation requisite is left to the medical attendant and nurse; and (4) upon recovery or removal disinfection of the bedding and clothing by steam is enforced. The disinfection and cleansing of the bedding and clothing is of extreme importance after puerperal fever, on account of the persistence of the infection and the facility with which it is communicable from bedding and clothing to those lying in. So also is the sanitary inspection and drain testing for the abatement of any nuisances, especially effluvia, as these are well known to be highly dangerous to the puerperal condition. Erysiptlas. - Buchan and Mitchell many years ago pointed out the close correspondence in London between the seasonal mortality curve of erysipelas and that of puerperal fever. It is generally a more readily communicable disease even than puerperal fever, and overcrowding, want of ventilation, effluvia, dirt, and other insanitary conditions, are well known predisposing causes. The disease is due to the entrance into the system of septic microorganisms. Usually vesicles or blebs, and bullœ or blisters are formed, which dry up into crusts and fall. The skin also may desquamate and be shed in flakes or bramy powder. Sometimes suppuration and sloughing take place, and matter and tissue are discharged. The septic organisms are also found in abscesses and unhealthy wounds. These crusts, flakes, and discharges spread the disease directly, or else indirectly by infected bedding and clothing. The same preventive measures required in puerperal fever should therefore be applied to erysipelas, for the protection of life and health. In a letter to the Chelsea Vestry in 1892, the Local Government Board urged that it is an infectious disease, communicable to others, and of especial danger to lying-in women, vaccinated children, in surgical operations, and to wounds generally. Sporadic eases are always a source of danger, and in large institutions the disease occasionally assumes formidable epidemic proportions. Therefore very forcible reasons exist for the notification of the disease, and for taking preventive measures. Unfortunately the term erysipelas may be strained to embrace anything from the least inflammatory blush of the surface to the most intense inflammation and destruction of the deeper cellular tissue. If enquiry, sanitary inspection, and disinfection are applied to this disease, the probability is that the more trivial cases, giving rise to little or no risk of infection, will be reduced in number, and that notification will be more confined, to those cases requiring disinfection and sanitary inspection of the premises, that is to say, those cases producing marked constitutional effects. From time to time the value of the notification of erysipelas has been called into question, and the conclusion arrived at has invariably been that there is much value in the notification of the major or serious cases of erysipelas, but that there is little value in the notification in the minor or trivial cases. The problem to my mind was how to exclude the notification of localised surface redness, swelling or heat of a trivial nature, often dignified by the 53 name of erysipelas, but requiring merely simple treatment and cleanliness to hasten its subsidence. About the middle of 1899, instruction was given to deal with notifications of erysipelas in the same manner as the notifications of other dangerous infectious diseases. That is to say, that from this time onward the person in charge of the patient received a notice requiring the disinfection of the bedding and clothing, if objection was taken to the Public Authority doing the disinfection, a certificate was required from the medical attendant stating that the disinfection of the bedding and clothing had been done under his supervision and to his satisfaction, and if done by the Public Authority a certificate of the Medical Officer of Health to a similar effect was sent to the person in charge of the patient. The essential point was that a certificate of satisfactory disinfection was required in every case notified as erysipelas, as in other dangerous infectious diseases, and the effect was to diminish the number of localised trivial surface reddenings notified as dangerous, as shown by the table on next, page. Here then is a practical method of separating minor from major cases, and of excluding the former from notification, since the medical attendant will not subject his patients to the inconvenience of disinfection and himself to the inconvenience of writing certificates in trivial cases, especially in such as continue to work and visit surgeries, dispensaries, and out-patient departments. The notification of erysipelas is valuable, amongst other things, in enabling measures to be taken— 1. For the disinfection of bedding and clothing. 2. For the prevention of the spread of erysipelas, puerperal fever, and other varieties of septic diseases. 3. For improving the sanitary condition of dwelling houses. With the object of taking these measures in each case of erysipelas notified, inquiry is forthwith made, disinfection of the bedding and clothing is carried out after removal to workhouse, or infirmary, or hospital, or after recovery or death at home, and the premises are inspected as to sanitary condition, and the drains tested. 54 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ST.

Tuberculosis is an infectious disease assuming many forms, of which the most readily spread is the pulmonary. Pulmonary tuberculosis may be regarded from either a curative or a preventive point of view, and these points are at the opposite ends of the chain of events. The stages of pulmonary tuberculosis are incipient, pronounced, advanced, and far advanced. On the one hand, for curative purposes it is most important to commence at the incipient stage, and hence the growing popularity of Sanatoriums. On the other hand, for preventive purposes it is most important to commence at the far advanced stage, as this stage is the most infectious. This is the stage at which segregation is of the utmost value, and segregation or isolation may be obtained either by providing a bed room specially set apart for the patient at home, or by removing the patient to a special institution away from home. The Poor Law Infirmaries receive a considerable number of advanced and far advanced cases. The Metropolitan Asylums Board has declined to become the Sanatorium Authority for the Metropolis on account of the probable expense involved in approaching the subject from a curative point ot view. This seems to contemplate the power of sending an unlimited number of cases "to the Board's Sanatoriums, as in other infectious diseases. But if the Metropolitan Asylums Board were to decline to take cases directly into their Sanatoriums, and could be pursuaded to undertake to relieve the Infirmaries 58 of the Metropolis of some of their chronic cases of pulmonary tuberculosis,, perhaps along this indirect line less resistance might be offered to taking part in the combat against tuberculosis from a prevent ire point of view. (e) THE COMPULSORY NOTIFICATION OF CONSUMPTION. On the 9th May, 1906, T made a report upon the subject of the compulsory notification of phthisis, which is so important that it should be quoted here. " Pursuant to instruction, I beg to report upon the various communications that have been received in reference to the notification of phthisis in London. These communications are a letter from the Clerk to the London Country Council, dated 25tli January, with further letter, dated 26th April; from the Town Clerk of Woolwich, dated 16th February; from the Town Clerk of Finsbury, dated 22nd February; from the National Association of Consumption and other forms of Tuberculosis, dated February; from the Clerk of the Kingston Union, dated February; and from the Town Clerk of Stepney, dated 5th April. The London County Council asks whether the St. Pancras Borough Council is of opinion:— (a) That phthisis should be declared under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to be a notifiable infectious disease; or (b) That the system of voluntary notification of the disease should be adopted throughout London, and that particulars as to patients attending hospitals and dispensaries should be obtained and circulated to each Borough. As to the Voluntary Notification. Voluntary notification has been adopted by all the Boroughs north of the Thames except Paddington and the group of 5 East End Boroughs, namely Bethnal Green, Shoreditch, Hackney, Stepney, and Poplar. Paddington appears to have voluntary notification in contemplation, so that it is only the group of 5 East End Boroughs of the 19 Boroughs north of theThames (including the City of London) that will not possess voluntary notification, and Hackney already in favour ; and of the 10 Boroughs south of the Thames 6 have adopted voluntary notification and 4 have not, these 4 being Battersea, Camberwell, Deptford, and Lewisham, and the last 3 have already resolved in favour of voluntary notification. It is obvious that within the last few years the London Boroughs have been gradually adopting the voluntary notification of Phthisis, and but very little pressure would cause some of those who have not yet adopted it to do so. Therefore the question of the London County Council, whether it is advisable that the system of voluntary notification should be adopted throughout London, practically answers itself, as it is probable that voluntary notification will be adopted universally by the Boroughs. 59 As to the Compulsory Notification. The experience of St. Paneras during the time that voluntary notification has been in force appears to coincide with that of nearly all other Authorities which have adopted the same course. This experience is that voluntary notification of Consumption is ideal in theory, hut of little value in practice, because the number of cases notified is very small, and the notifications often take place when the patients are moribund. The reasons for the unsatisfactory working of voluntary notification are that the duty of medical practitioners is first to their patient, and that therefore the desire of the Public Authority to obtain notification can scarcely weigh with them; furthermore the experience is that patients suffering from Consumption are so apprehensive and timid of interference that persuasion will not induce them-to allow their cases to be notified. If notification were compulsory, the law would give the Authority no more power than it has at present under the voluntary system beyond the actual notification; 110 power to interfere with the doctor or patient as to isolation, disinfection, or sanitary inspection, without the desire of the patient and the advice of the medical attendant. The value of compulsory notification would be this, that practically all the cases of Consumption would come to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health and he would be able to send out to each of these cases the printed matter which is now sent out under the voluntary system, and that therefore a very much larger number of afflicted persons would be made acquainted with the desire of the Authority to help them if they needed help, and of the methods that could be adopted by them without the help of the Authority if they desired no official interference; furthermore, a record of the distribution and localisation of Consumption would be obtained as a guide to the condition of parts of the Borough. In Scotland, Pulmonary Phthisis is defined as an infectious disease and all the powers, in addition to notification, are applicable to it. This, in my opinion, is undesirable. I11 Sheffield, by a Local Act, the notification is compulsory, and so also is disinfection. In London, if the notification clause only were made applicable to Consumption, as it can be without conferring any other power, in my opinion it would be even preferable to the method in force ill Sheffield, because it would leave to the medical attendant, who must know better than anyone else, the circumstances as to isolation or removal, disinfection or cleansing, and sanitary inspection or amendment. All medical practitioners would be placed on the same footing with regard to each other and with regard to their patients, and all patients would be 011 an equal basis, and not exposed to interference. The communication mentioned in the first paragraph of this report as received from Woolwich, states that the Woolwich Borough Council have asked the London County Council to take steps to cause Phthisis to be declared a notifiable disease, and they ask the St. Pancras Borougli Council to take similar action. The communication from the Finsbury Borough Council does not deal with the question of notification at all but with the provision of sanatoria and the isolation of advanced cases of phthisis. The communication from the 60 National Association for the Prevention of Consumption urges upon Public Authorities generally to at least adopt voluntary notification. The communication from the Kingston Board of Guardians urges the St. Pancras Borough Council to pass a like resolution to them and forward the same to the Local Government Board, the Resolution being— 'That application be 'made to the Local Government Board to include Phthisis in the list of 'notifiable diseases contemplated by the Infectious Disease Act, 1899, and any 'subsequent Act defining notifiable diseases, and that a copy of this resolution 'be forwarded to each Board of Guardians and Urban Councils in Great 'Britain requesting their co-operation in obtaining the object contemplated.' This motion is stated to have been carried unanimously by the Board. The communication from the Borough Council of Stepney contains the following recommendation which was approved and adopted on the 28th March last:— 'That the London County Council be informel that this Council con'tinues in its opinion expressed in August, 1905, that it would be undesirable 'to adopt the system of voluntary notification of Phthisis, and believes that it 'would be inexpedient at the present time to add this disease to the list of 'compulsory notifiable diseases specified in the Public Health (London) Act, '1891.' It is very probable that the East End Boroughs have some fear of the expense of the notification of Consumption, whether voluntary or compulsory. The advantage here of compulsory notification as against voluntary notification would be that instead of the cost falling directly on the Borough it would be chargeable to the common poor fund so that the poorer Boroughs would be relieved at the expense of the richer. This appears to me a very important consideration from an administrative point of view. The Metropolitan Borough of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health, which Branch includes amongst its members practically all of the Medical Officers of Health in the Metropolis, on the 23rd March last, passed the following resolution: 'That, in the opinion of the Metropolitan Branch of 'the Incorporated Societv of Medical Officers of Health it is desirable in the 'interests of the Public and for the prevention of the spread of tuberculous 'diseases of the lungs that such diseases should be compulsorily notifiable by 'medical practitioners to Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health.' This resolution is intended to stop at notification and to give no power of interference to public authorities beyond this. I beg therefore to recommend— That the London County Council be urged to put into force section 56 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and make an order to apply the notification section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, to Pulmonary Phthisis, throughout the Boroughs of London." This recommendation was approved and adopted by the Borough Council on the 16th May, 1906. 61 TUBERCULOSIS AND LAUNDRY WORKERS. S. Bernheim and A. Roblot (Zeit. f. Tuber., Band viii, Heft 1) call attention to the danger of the spread of Phthisis by means of the soiled linen from tuberculous patients. The authors have been struck by the large number of men and women engaged on work at laundries who attend at the antituberculosis dispensaries in Paris, and who, if questioned, state that very many of their companions have died of phthisis. Statistics bear out the impression thus obtained. Laënnec, for example, states that 143 out of 238 men and women engaged in laundry work who died during five years died from phthisis. The authors believe that the mortality from phthisis amongst laundry workers, at any rate those belonging to the small laundries, is higher than the mortality from the fame cause amongst nurses. There can be no doubt that inoculation with the tuberculous virus may occur as a result of handling the linen from tuberculous patients, and Foa has made an observation on five cases in which tuberculous nodules developed under such circumstances. At the same time a profound negligence is shown both by the public and the laundry workers in the treatment of linen which may be contagious. The authors examined the handkerchiefs, the serviettes, and the bed linen of tuberculous patients, and demonstrated the presence of Koch's bacilli. To lessen the danger of spread of infection the authors recommend:—(1) That the linen should be taken away from the houses in boxes or bags, which should be disinfected before they are returned. (2) that there should be a preliminary disinfection of the linen on its arrival at the laundry, the disinfection to take place preferably within the boxes or bags in which the linen has been brought; (3) that the reception and disinfecting room should be altogether separate from the washing room; (4) that there should be one set of vehicles for taking the soiled linen from the houses, and that these vehicles should be often disinfected, while the clean clothes should be delivered from another set of vehicles. The Ministry of Commerce published regulations on the subject in 1905, which would have been satisfactory enough if carried out; but the regulations were not to come into operation at once, and some of them not for three years, by which time they will probably have sunk out of sight. The difficulty of pressing such regulations under present conditions is obvious, because the price of carrying them out would be prohibitive for the smaller laundries, but at the same time the precautions are needed in the interests both of the workers at the laundries and of the general public.—(Epitome British Medical Journal, March 3, 1906.) CEREBROSPINAL FEVER. Extracts from a memorandum dated July, 1905, on cerebro-spinal fever, by Mr. W. H. Power, C.B., F.R.S , Medical Officer of the Local Government Hoard. Cerebro-spinal fever is not of rare occurrence in the United Kingdom. In the course of the last forty years this malady is known to have been prevalent in a considerable number of different localities in England and Wales, several of these local outbreaks having taken place in recent years. In some instances they have formed the subject of investigation by a medical Inspector of the Local Government Board whose report has usually been made public. Occurrences of cerebro-spinal fever have also boon observed in Scotland and in Ireland. There is indeed, as will appear later, reason for belief that this. 6'2 disease is even less uncommon in this country than the foregoing particulars would seem to indicate. The late Mr. Netten Radcliffe defined cerebro-spinal fever as "an acute, epidemic disease, characterised by profound disturbance of the central nervous system, indicated at the onset chiefly by shivering, intense headache or vertigo, or both, and persistent vomiting; subsequently by delirium, often violent, alternating with somnolent or a state of apathy or stupor; an acutely painful condition with spasm—sometimes tetanoid—of certain groups of muscles, especially the posterior muscles of the neck, occasioning retraction of the head; and an increased sensitiveness of the surface of the body. Throughout the disease there is marked depression of the vital powers ; not unfrequently collapse ; and in its course an eruption of vesicles, petechial, or purpuric spots, or mottling of the skin, is apt to occur. If the disease tends to recovery, the symptoms gradually subside without any critical phenomena, and convalescence is protracted; if to a fatal termination death is almost invaribly preceded by coma. After death the enveloping membranes of the brain and spinal cord are found in a morbid state, of which the most notable signs are engorgement of the blood vessels, usually excessive, and an effusion of seropurulent matter into the meshes of the pia mater and beneath the arachnoid." To the clinical manifestations of the disease, indicated in this definition, may be added the presence of Kernig's sign' and of tache cerebrate.† Local prevalence of a malady distinguished by the foregoing features would, 110 doubt, attract attention, and would, it may be presumed, lead to early recognition of its true nature. But while these features are characteristic of cerebro-spinal fever of typical and severe sort, experience has taught us that this fever may and does appear in milder or in anomalous forms which render identification difficult, and which lead to its being mistaken for other ailments of more common occurrence in this country. Illustration of this is afforded by certain localised outbreaks of cerebro-spinal fever in the eastern counties in 1890, where this disease was generally mistaken for sunstroke or for enteric fever, or was looked upon as a new form of illness; by the prevalence of whatwould seem to have been cerebro-spinal fever in Northamptonshire in 1890-91, where the malady was for the most part diagnosed as pneumonia or as sore-throat; and by the occurrence of cerebro-spinal fever in Irihlingborough in the present year, where many of the persons attacked were regarded as suffering from influenza. In these anomalous forms of cerebro-spinal fever, many or even most of the symptoms associated with the recognised type of the disease may be absent, while, in mild cases, they may be so slight or of such brief duration as to escape notice. It is, however, for such cases that it is necessary to be on the outlook, whether in relation with a * To obtain this sign, the patient is placed so that the hip-joint is semi-flexed, and while the hip-joint is retained in this position, the knee-joint is extended passively. A contraction of the hamstrings then sets in, which causes resistance to the extension. †A congested streak produced by drawing the finger-nail gently over the patient's thigh, abdomen, or face. In cases of meningitis this appears earlier (within 30 seconds), lasts longer (8, 10, or 15 minutes), and is broader and of deeper colour than in healthy persons. SAINT PANCRAS, LONDON.

In these circumstances, there would be advantage in the local medical officer of health endeavouring to secure, by arrangement with the medical men practising in his district, information as to the existence of cases of the kind in question. Failure to recognise cerebro-spinal fever is also apt to happen when the malady is of the "fulminant" variety, in which death ensues rapidly. In these instances the disease has been mistaken for typhus fever, idiopathic tetanus, or malignant measles. An important aid to diagnosis may be found in examination of cerebrospinal fluid, withdrawn from the lower part of the spinal canal by lumbar puncture, for the presence of the "diplococcus meningitidis intracellularis" of Weichselbaum; a micro-organism which is now generally regarded as the specific cause of cerebro-spinal fever. DIPHTHERIA AND SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. In April, 1906, the Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health, considered the mode of the spread of Diphtheria in Schools, and decided, "that it is desirable that in the event of the prevalence of diphtheria in any district, any Child excluded from school for sore-throat should not be admitted to school without a certificate of freedom from infection, based on bacteriological examination." § 8.—ISOLATION.

The Articles to be Disinfected. A book consists of outside covers, edges, and back, and inside leaves. The inside leaves are so numerous and so closely adherent to each other that it is impossible to guarantee disinfection between each of the leaves. If a book has actually been used by an infected patient it is possible that there may be some infection between the leaves in one or more places, whereas if the book has only been standing or lying on a shelf or table and has not been opened or read in an infected room it is improbable that there will be any infection between the leaves. The covers and edges of a book are easily accessible for disinfection, but the accessibility of the back depends upon its construction. The more closely the back of the cover of the book is adherent to the back of the folded leaves where they are sewn or wired, the less chance there will be of the access of infection, but if the back of the cover is unattached to the back of the leaves then infection may obtain access between the two. The Process of Disinfection. It is obvious that the mode of disinfection of books must depend upon the mode of infection. (a) If a book has been actually used by a patient when suffering from an infectious disease, the only certain manner of reaching the infection and dealing with it effectually is to destroy the book by fire. 67 (b) If a book has not been used by an infected patient but has been used by some person in an infected room, or has been stood or laid in an infected room, it should be disinfected by being stood in a fumigating chamber in such a position that the back of the cover may be upward and stand away from the back of the leaves, the sides being spread out like the letter A, so as to expose the leaves as much as possible and to support the book in this its most exposed position. (c) If a book has not been used by an infected patient and has not been within the infected room and has only stood or lain in some other part of the dwelling, it will be sufficient if the edges, cover and back be carefully dusted and thoroughly cleansed in the open air. It is not necessary, but if thought desirable they may be wiped over with a cloth damped with some liquid disinfectant. The Disinfectants. (а) Infected books requiring to be destroyed by tire are burnt either in the incinerator at the Disinfecting Station, or are sent to the furnaces at the Refuse Destructor, according to their bulk and number. (b) Infected books requiring to be disinfected are treated at the Disinfecting Station. Steam heat is absolutely ruinous to books, and dry heat dries the adhesive substances and the cover materials, so that the parts warp unequally and separate from each other. Therefore, books are not subjected to heat, wet or dry, in the hot Chambers, but are disinfected in the fumigating Chamber. Sulphurous acid gas (from burning sulphur) tends when in close proximity, to turn the metallic lettering on books black. Formaldehyde gas is free from this drawback, and as this is a highly diffusible gas the surfaces of the fumigating Chamber have been specially treated so as to stop all leakages and absorption and to render the process effectual. (c) Books merely requiring to be dusted and cleansed can be dealt with at home, and if it is particularly desired to use a disinfectant they may be wiped with a cloth damped in strong solution of washing soda.

PANCRAS. Public Health Department. Notice to Persons in Contact with Dangerous Infectious Diseases. Contact Shelter. The St. Pancras Borough Council have provided a Contact Shelter in Cambridge Street, King's Road, Pancras Road, N.W. (on the east side of St. Pancras Gardens), for the purpose of temporarily sheltering those whose dwellings are being disinfected after dangerous infectious disease, and of disinfecting the person and clothing of those who have been in close contact with dangerous infectious disease. 69 A family whose dwelling, tenement, or flat docs not afford sufficient accommodation during the disinfection of part or of the whole of their dwelling will be temporarily accommodated in the Contact Shelter, which is provided with baths and disinfecting chamber. A midwife, after attending upon a patient suffering from puerperal fever or from any other illness supposed to be infectious, by the rules of the Central Midwives Board, must disinfect herself and all her instruments and other appliances to the satisfaction of the local Sanitary Authority, and must have her clothing thoroughly disinfected before going to another labour. For this purpose the baths and disinfecting chamber at the Contact Shelter are available, and after cleansing and disinfection a midwife is given a certificate to the effect that she has undergone personal cleansing (including hair and nails) in a warm bath, that her personal clothing has undergone disinfection or destruction, that her hands have been specially disinfected bv soaking in methylated spirit and in solution of perchloride of mercury (1 in 1,000), and that the instruments brought with her have been sterilised or destroyed, namely, the gum elastic instruments and parts destroyed, metal and other articles steamed, the lining of the bag destroyed and the rest of the bag washed with corrosive sublimate solution. A person who has been in contact with Smallpox should, as soon as possible, undergo personal cleansing (including hair and nails) in a warm bath, and the personal clothing should undergo disinfection or destruction. The Contact Shelter is available for this purpose, and a certificate to the above effect will be given to a Smallpox contact undergoing such cleansing and disinfection. If, in addition, the certificate of the Public Vaccinator or any other medical practitioner is obtained to the effect that the person has been efficiently vaccinated or re-vaccinated, all practical precautions will have been taken against the spread of the disease, and any occupation may be followed with comparative safety. Such precautions having been taken an employer should not find it necessary to suspend or discharge an employee. The Contact Shelter is also available for a person in contact with any other dangerous infectious disease, for instance, scarlet fever, and a certificate will be given to any contact undergoing personal cleansing and disinfection.

PERSONAL CLEANSING HOUSE. In 1903, the Borough Council resolved, that in accordance with the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, bath rooms and waiting places should be provided, adjoining the Disinfecting Station, for the cleansing of persons and the disinfesting of clothing: infested with vermin. Accordingly, towards the end of 1903 and the beginning of 1904, at the north end of the Contact Shelter two baths and a small waiting lobby were provided for men on the ground floor and two bath-rooms and a small waiting lobby for women and children on the floor over, and an outside iron staircase erected in the yard as a separate means of approach for the women and children. The Woman Attendant at the Contact Shelter was instructed to act also as attendant at the Personal Cleansing House. The provision was completed towards the end of the first quarter of 1904, and during the remaining three quarters of that year 1796 men, women, and children were cleansed and disinfested of vermin. (See tables on next page.) During 1905, the number of persons cleansed and disinfested was 3,401. But during the year it was observed that the attendance of children was steadily diminishing until it almost ceased. (See tahlta on next page.) Careful inquiry disclosed the fact that the children mainly consisted of school children attending elementary schools, whose parents objected to their association with verminous men and women, and indeed, objected to the mention of Borough of St PancraS. Cleansing Station, FIRST FLOOR. Scale of Feet. wm.nisbet Blair.M.Inst C.e. Borough Engineer & Surveyor, JANUARY, /907. 71 ''vermin," although school-children are prone to become infested. Accordingly, the Borough Council provided in the estimates for the erection of " Children's Maths," separate and distinct from, but adjoining the baths for adults, the Contact Shelter, and the disinfecting chambers. CHILDREN'S BATHS. In the first quarter of this year, 1906, two rooms with baths, on the upper Hoor of the Contact Shelter building were set apart for children, and separate access was obtained to them by means of an iron staircase from St. Pancras Gardens, and a doorway made in the west front of the building. One of the rooms is used by the boys and the other by the girls, and the corridor leading to the rooms has a glass door at each end, of which only the woman attendant has the keys. The glass door at the south end leads to the Contact Shelter, and that at the north end of the corridor to the womens baths in the personal cleansing house, and so by the iron staircase at the rear of the building to the yard and the disinfecting chambers, where the clothing is disinfested of vermin whilst the children are being bathed and treated by the woman attendant. (See the accompanying plans shoewing the arranigements of the buildings.) At the same time as these alterations took place, cards of admission were printed and sent to school teachers for distribution to such children as require cleansing. At the same time, also, the attendant at the Children's Baths was instructed to inquire as to the bedfellows of verminous children, and to persuade them to bring their bedfellows with them, and also to advise them to tell their mothers to change und wash the pillow-cases and the sheets so that the children may escape being re-infested.

In the early part of the year the Public Health Committee re-arranged the duties of the Inspectors. To the Special Inspector, Mr. Auger, was allotted a District (known as the Town Hall District) in which to carry out all the duties of a Food Inspector, a Workshop Inspector, a District Inspector, and a Tenement House Inspector, and he was instructed to cease to carry out the following duties outside the Town Hall District—investigating cases of smallpox and contacts therewith, inquiring as to the notifications of Port Sanitary Authorities and attending to special complaints, inspecting underground bakehouses, offensive trade premises, rag and bone stores, fried fish shops, effluvia business, and special mattors, and also inspecting disinfected rooms ; he was further instructed to carry out all the duties of a Sanitary Inspector in the Town Hall District, also to continue to supervise the work at the Disinfecting Station and Personal Cleansing Station, which are situated in the Town Hall District, also to have the duty of accompanying Inspectors in cases where confirmation of a drain test is necessary. The District Inspectors were instructed to write their own Diaries and Indices instead of the Clerks writing them, to cease to write their notices and continue to leave the Office by 10 o'clock except in special circumstances such as having to make plans or reports, etc. 81 The Clerks were instructed to cease to write the Inspectors' diaries and instead to write out all their rotices, and the First Clerk instead of the Special Inspector to receive and distribute to the other Clerks for entry and to the several Inspectors for attention all complaints, notifications, removals, etc., and to collect them again for the purpose of being docketed or filed. On the 30th January, 1907, it was resolved by the Public Health Committee that an instruction be given to the Inspectors, when watching chimneys for evidence of smoke nuisance, not to spend more than half-an-hour, unless the nuisance is actually being committed, and it is consequently necessary for their observations to be prolonged.

Smoke.— In the Annual Report for 1902 the enactments dealing with smoke were set out in full. There are 221 smoke shafts on the Register; 840 observations of these were taken, and 13 re-inspections were made after notices served. These observations or inspections and re-inspections occupy a considerable amount of time, as the intervals between stoking are of considerable duration—at least twenty minutes, and often twice as long. The Inspectors are now instructed to limit their observation of a chimney to half-an-hour, and only to prolong it beyond this period so long as a nuisance is actually being committed. (See Minutes of Public Health Committee ot 30th january, 1907.) Effluvia.—Of various businesses or places producing effluvia or offensive emanations there are 95 on the Registers, and of these 117 inspections and 25 re-inspections were made. (See also under the head of Nuisances § 9.) § 3—DWELLINGS. (a) House-to-House Inquiries and Inspections.— (i) For the purpose of ascertaining the mode of sub-letting, 272 inquiries and 181 re-visits were made as to the occupation of houses in tenemented streets, (ii.) When the mode of sub-letting appears to be such as to necessitate periodical supervision of the sanitary condition of a house a complete enquiry is made into the mode of occupation of each room of the house, (iii) When it has been decided to register a tenement house each room is measured as to its dimensions and capacity and recorded in the Register. The forms in which the reports as to these matters are made, were quoted in the Annual Report for 1901. (b) Tenement Houses..—During the year, 235 inspections and 33 re-inspections were made for the purpose of measuring tenement or lodging-houses which it had been decided to register, and at the end of the year 2,296 houses were upon the register. Of these houses, 2 369 periodical half-yearly inspections were made, and 5,504 re-inspections after the service of notices. Also of the 192 dwellings entered in the register of Inscribed Dwellings 309 inspections were made, and 305 re-insnections after the service of notices. The following is the record relating to registered tenement houses :— On Register at end of 1905 2,192 Registered during 1906 151 Total 2,343 Ceased to be tenement houses 1906 47 On Register at end of 1906 2,296 87 (c) Underground Dwellings.—At the end of the year there were on the Register 538 underground rooms which had been illegally occupied as dwellings, and had been ordered to be closed, and of which 134 inspections had been made, and 18 re-inspections after notices served. Time is allowed to the occupants of these rooms to find rooms elsewhere, and during the time allowed the illegally occupied rooms are kept under observation, and the number vacated or otherwise occupied ascertained and reported. The houses in which these dwellings are found are added to the register of registered tenement houses. (d) Common Lodging Houses.—There are 25 Registered Common Lodging Houses in St. Pancras, and these are supervised by the London County Council, including the one Salvation Army Shelter in South St. Pancras. Rowton Houses are not so registered ; of these there are in St Pancras one at the southern end of King's Cross Road in South St. Pancras, and another at the northern end of Arlington Road in West St. Pancras. (e) Canal Bo".t Dwellings.—During the year 93 visits of inspection were paid to the 31 wharves on the Regent's Canal. (f) Working-Clans Flats. —A list of the principal of these and the accommodation provided will be found in the Appendix to this Report. Ton bridge Street, &c., Displacement. — In 1903 the East End Dwellings Company demolished Nos. 1 to 23 (odd, inclusive) Tollbridge Street, Euston Road ; 1 and 2, Brunswick Place ; 108, 110, and 112, Cromer Street; 1 to 31 (consecutive and inclusive), Peace Cottages (except 17 and 18, which had been demolished in some former year) ; and 7 to 23 (consecutive and inclusive), Speedy Place, comprising 63 separate houses, and displacing about 327 persons. On the site, the East End Dwellings Company erccted Ton bridge House, which was opened in 1904, and houses 245 persons. Fitzroy Court, &c., Displacement.—Recently a site on the west side of Tottenham Court Road, bounded by Warren Street. Whitfield Place, and Fitzroy Court, has been cleared, consisting of some 15 houses and shops, and two blocks of artizans dwellings, containing some 204 rooms and displacing about 500 persons. No proposition appears yet to have been made to provide housing accommodation to re-house these displaced persons. Revenue Act, 1903. —In the " Daily Telegraph" of November 8th, 1906, it was reported from St. Petersburg that at a meeting of the Senate to discuss the elections to the Duma and the Council of the Empire, the following definition •was adopted :—" By the term ' own dwelling,' the value of which must entitle the occupier to take part in municipal electoral meetings, is to be understood a dwelling occupied by a single household, with independent threshold and hearth, and having no interior communication with other dwellings." This definition is an interesting example in comparative social legislation. (g).—HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACTS. Part I. Area No. 1. Somers Town. 1 (a).— Church way Scheme —In continuation of the previous Annual Reports on the subject of housing, this scheme was completed by the London County Council; the other schemes are moving as described here following. 88 1 (A) Part of ana west of Chalten Street and north of Drummond Street line.—The houses in this area were dealt with individually under the Public Health Act years ago. 1 (e).—Part of area east of Chalt on Street.—In continuation of the history of the Chapel Grove and Eastnor Place Schemes. The schemes of 1898. amended in 1901, relating to these two areas were embodied in one Order by the Local Government board, and a notice thereof published in the "London Gazette." The Midland Railway Company having acquired the land in 1898, petitioned against the Order in December, 1905, as did also a leaseholder, and the Order of the Local Government Board sanctioning and embodying the schemes became "provisional." On the 17th February, 1906, the Directors of the Midland Railway Company, by letter, suggested that the Borough Council should endeavour to find another site for the erection of the new buildings for re-housing persons proposed to be disturbed under this scheme. The Local Government Board introduced a Bill into the House of Commons entitled '' An Act to confirm a Provisional Order of the Local Government Board relating to the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras." This Act was passed on the 4th August, 1906. It is provided in the Act (section I) that "the Order set out in the schedule hereto shall be and the same is hereby confirmed and all the provisions thereof shall have full validity and force as from a date to be fixed by an Order of the Local Government Board, not being less than twelve months from the passing of this Act." AREAS No. 2 and 3. Prospect Terrace and Brantome Place Order.—In the Order the number of persons to be displaced from these two areas is 1,165, and the number to be re-lioused on the three sites scheduled in the Order is 842 persons. The position with regard to the three sites is as follows:— (а) Great College Street Site.—On this additional vacant site included in the Order of the Local Government Board for the purpose of housing part of the persons displaced from the Brantome Place and Prospect Terrace areas, Goldington Buildings were erected and opened in 1904, and are fully occupied. These buildings were described under the head of 9 Working Class tlats in the Annual Report for 1905, p. 108, and accommodate 332 persons, or 10 more than required on this site by the Order of the Local Government Board. (b) Brantome Place Area.—The erection of dwellings upon the cleared area of Brantome Place was further considered. In March the Borough Council set aside The plans approved by the Borough Council, the County Council, the Local Government Board, and the Skinners Company in 1901-2, as being too expensive and unsatisfactory, on account of the washhouses, sculleries, sinks, and w.c.'s being used in common on each floor, and considered it undesirable to have dwellings of the associated type and to substitute for them dwellings of the self-contained type. Accordingly plans of selfcontained type of dwellings were prepared, and after consideration and re-consideration approved by the Borough Council, the County Council, the Local Government Board, and the Skinners Company 89 The specification and the quantities were prepared. These were fully considered and revised, and in March, 1907, tenders were advertised for. (c) Prospect Terrace Area.—According to instruction the Chief Clerk prepared a complete History of the Prospect Terrace Roadway, and this was printed and presented to the Borough Council and appeared in the Minutes of the 7tli March, 1906, p. 327-354, Vol. II. Negotiations for purchase continued, and on 11th July the Council decided to accept the offer of the Rectors of St. George-the-Martyr and St. George, Bloomsbury, to sell the land forming the roadway of Prospect Terrace for £1,600, with Solicitor's charges, £150, and Surveyor's fees not exceeding 42 guineas. With regard to the houses upon the Area, during 1905 they were repeatedly repaired and cleansed, and the rents were lowered, but their condition was such that on 25th April, 1906, the Borough Council decided that one-sixth of the tenants on the Area be given notice to quit in each of three successive weeks. In deference to the request of a deputation the tenants were allowed an extension of time, but the condition of the houses became such, that on the 13th June the Borough Council decided that the remaining tenants of Prospect Terrace, Derry Street, and Wellington Square should be required to remove before the end of July, and on the 25th July, 1906, the Council gave instructions to the Borough Engineer to take the necessary steps to demolish the houses with all possible expedition. LITTLE CLARENDON STREET. The Local Government Board asked to be furnished with information as to the condition of Little Clarendon Street, Somers Town, and they were acquainted by letter accordingly as follows:— "Hitherto Little Clarendon Street has been dealt with by the Borough "Council under the Public Health (London) Act. All the houses in " the street are registered under the By-laws for houses let in "lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, under " which By-Laws they are duly inspected. A large number of "notices arc being served from time to time requiring the owners to " maintain the property in a sanitary condition. The question of "dealing with the property under the Housing of the Working " Classes Acts has not been brought under the consideration of the " Local Authority." In reply to this letter a further communication was received from the Local Government Board, stating that they think that the question of dealing with the property under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts should be brought under the consideration of the Borough Council, and requesting that this be done, and that the Medical Officer of Health be instructed to report upon the subject, and also asking that they may receive a copy of such report. The Medical Officer of Health was instructed to report on the condition of the houses in Little Clarendon Street, and presented the following report accordingly:— 90 Little Clarendon Street is situated in Ward 6 of the Division of East St. Pancras, and runs parallel to, and between Clarendon Street and Seymour Street. At the north end it opens into Johnson Street, and at the south end into Aldenham Street. It is not a thoroughfare because it leads to no-where and is not in the line of any particular direction for foot passengers, consequently the street is traversed by scarcely any one except the occupiers of it. Near the centre of the east side is a public house, the use of which appears to be almost entirely confined to the occupants of the street, and which has been for a long time past under the consideration of the magistrates as to closure and compensation. When this public-house is closed, it may be prophesied with some certainty that the character of the street will improve if the owners of the houses will, at the same time, make some effort to more effectually control the premises and the occupants thereof. The street is about 420 feet long, about 24½ feet wide, and the houses on cach side of the street are only of two stories, and average a height of about 19 feet. Behind the houses on the east side are the backs of the houses in Clarendon Street at a distance of about 26½ feet from the backs of the Little Clarendon Street houses; the houses in Clarendon Street being of three stories and averaging 23 feet in height. Similarly from the backs of the houses on the west side of Little ('larendon Street to the backs of the houses in Seymour Street is a space of about 22 feet, and the average height of the houses in Seymour Street is about 30 feet. From these measurements it will be seen that the houses in Little Clarendon Street are not over-shadowed, that there is ample space at the backs of the houses, and that the height of the houses is not as great as the width of the street. The street is periodically swept and cleansed, and the house refuse is removed regularly, so that the conditions of the surroundings of the houses cannot be regarded as unhealthy. With regard to the structure of the houses themselves, each house consists of four rooms, two on each floor, with an open back yard, water tap, w.c., and dust receptacle, and most of them within recent years have been laid with new drains. The roofs, floors, ceilings, and walls are in fair condition, and as I have before said, there is no fault to be found with the supply of light and air, and the water taps are supplied directly from the main. With regard to the decorative condition of the houses, the premises are visited every six months by the Inspector, and a large number of notices are served requiring cleansing, and others requiring minor repairs to roofs, w.c. apparatus, &c. The number of notices served is very much larger on the west side of the street than on the east side, the reason for this will appear presently. With regard to the occupation of the houses in the street a large number of notices are periodically served to abate overcrowding, and the experience is that as fast as overcrowding is abated on one premises it arises on another; this applies more particularly to the west side of the street, and is due to material difference in the manner in which the premises are let on the two sides of the street. On the east side a considerable number of the houses are let to one family, and consequently are kept in fair structural and decorative condition, and are not overcrowded, and those that are let to more than one family are not let in 91 a smaller sub-division than in two separate floors, but on the west side the houses are not let either as a whole or in floors, but in single rooms, each separate room being occupied by a separate family, so that each house on an average contains four families; but it would not be correct to say that a house of similar size containing four times the number of families that another contains would be required to be cleansed, repaired, and redecorated four times oftener, yet it may be said that the relative frequency of cleansing, repair, and redecoration must increase progressively with the increase in the number of families occupying the house; and, furthermore, that the standard of living of the occupants must become progressively lower. Consequently Little Claendon Street has attracted to itself the most undesirable element of the population within a large radius assisted by the centrifugalized force imparted to the crowded residents of central London by demolitions and changes in the use of dwelling houses. Overcrowding is a chronic condition in Little Clarendon Street, and as fast as the Inspector abates it in one room it occurs in another, especiallv on the west side. This is due to the fact that there is no such control as exists in artizans' dwelling, for instance, where there is a resident superintendent, only one entrance which is under the superintendent's eye, and who controls ail those who come in and go out, and who sees that minor repairs and cleansing are properly done, or does them himself where it is his duty to do them. If Little Clarendon Street could be subjected to the conditions that artizans' dwellings are subjected to, namely, if only one entrance at which a caretaker should reside, and if a resident caretaker were placed in charge and made responsible for the condition of the houses, and for the behaviour of the tenants, and if the owner or owners started with them in good structural and decorative repair and cleanliness, I see no reason why Little Clarendon Street should not be made as model a place to reside in as any of the fair class of artizans' dwellings in the neighbourhood. A copy of this report was forwarded for the information of the Local Government Board. 92 HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890, PART II., SINGLE HOUSES.

In the case of individual houses efforts are made to exhaust the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to remedy defects, before resorting to the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, except when it is obvious that no remedy short of demolition and reconstruction is available. § 4-SCHOOLS. At the 66 grant receiving schools 173 inspections were made during the year by the Woman Inspector. The Board of Education decided to relieve Local Authorities from the obligation to provide school places for children under the age of five years, the age at which compulsory school attendance begins ; and many Authorities are ceasing to admit to school children from 3-5 years of age. § 5.—FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. Factories.—The Men Inspectors had 393 and the Woman Inspector 102 factories upon the Registers for periodical inspection as to water service, sanitary conveniences, drainage, and nuisances. During tne year 44 and 76 inspections of factories, respectively, were made, and 10 re-inspections after notices served. 93 Workshops.—The Men Inspectors had 656 (apart from bakehouses) and the Woman Inspector 419 workshops (apart from laundries) on the Registers for periodical inspection. During the year 854 and 217 inspections, respectively, of these premises were made, and 345 and 16 re-inspections after notices. Workplaces.—These include restaurant kitchens, cab and omnibus yards, laundries and domestic workshops, and home workplaces. Domestic Workshops and Home Workplaces.—The Woman Inspector has 316 of these on the Register, of which 382 inspections and 5 re-inspections after notice were made. These places vary in number from year to year, and according to the season of the year. Laundries.—On the Register are 73 laundries at which the Woman Inspector made 99 inspections and 8 re-inspections. Restaurant Kitchens.—Of these the Men Inspectors had 93 and the Woman Inspector 161 on the Registers. At the former 151 inspections and 99 reinspections were made, and at the latter 0 inspections and 1 re-inspection. Bakehouses.—At the commencement of the year there were 128 workshopbakehouses. Of these and of the three factory bakehouses, and the three bakehouses in hotels, 366 inspections and 232 re-inspections were made. This large number of re-inspections was part of the work in connection with certifying underground bakehouses. Sanitary Conveniences in Factories and Workshops.—Under § 7, Drainage, will be found a note upon the structural requirements of sanitary conveniences in factories and workshops. Tabular Statement. —The following is a tabular statement of the work of the Men Inspectors, in the form desired by the Factory Department of the Home Office:— METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ST.

In the early part of the year I visited many of the Teachers with a view of gaining their interest in the spread of information relating to the prevention of consumption. Throughout the year much time has been given to the promotion of clcaliness among children of school age. This question has some industrial importance, and has received attention from H.M. Inspectors of Factories. The treatment provided at the Children's Baths is much appreciated ; the Teachers report improvement in the children treated, and there is reason to believe that work of permanent educational value is being done. I have made every effort to discover Home-workers who may not have been notified by their employers as required by law, but without success. The District Inspectors and the Voluntary Visitors associated with Miss Gardiner's work should be valuable sources of information on this matter ; and the fact that they have not informed me of any outworkers not notified in due form seems to indicate that the lists are fairly complete. I have also made a further test by visiting addresses notified in previous years and not re-notified ; in these cases I have always found that the persons concerned have removed or given up work.

Cutting off Writer Supply.—By the Metropolis Water Act, 1871, Clause 32, it is provided that— Where in any district any company is required or has proposed to provide a constant supply— If any person supplied with water by such company wilfully or negligently causes or suffers any fittings to be out of repair, or to be used or contrived us that the water supplied to him by such company is or is likely to be wasted, misused, unduly consumed, or contaminated, or so as to occasion or allow the return of foul air or other noisome or impure matter into any pipe belonging to or connected with the pipes of such company, he shall for every such offence be liable to a penalty not exceeding five pounds; or If any person supplied with water by such company wrongfully does or causes or permits to be do e anything in contravention of any of the provisions of the special Act or this Act, or wrongfully fails to do anything which, under any of those provisions, ought to be done for the prevention of the waste, misuse, undue consumption, or contamination of the water of such company, they may (without prejudice to any remedy against him in respect thereof) cut off any of the pipes by or through which water is supplied by them to him or for his use, and may cease to supply him with water, so long as the cause of injury remains or is not remedied ; and in every case of so cutting off or ceasing to supply, the company shall within twenty-four hours thereafter give to the nuisance authority, as defined by the Sanitary Act, 1866, notice thereof. NOTICE TO NUISANCE AUTHORITY. SANITARY ACT, 1866. Sanitary authorities are now substituted for nuisance authorities by sees. 14 (2) and 99 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, ante vol. i. The Sanitary Act, 1866, is repealed and the present section must be read as if the corresponding provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, were therein referred to instead of the Repealed Act lb, sec. 142. Within twenty-four hours of exercising their right of cutting off the water, the water company is required to give notice thereof in writing to the sanitary authority. 1b. sec. 49. And see Young v.

EXTRACT FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1891. 49.—Notice to sanitary authoriry of water supply being cut off.— (1) Where a water company may lawfully cut off the water supply to any inhabited dwelling house, and cease to supply such dwelling-house with water for nonpayment of water rate or other cause, the company shall in every case, within twenty-four hours after exercising the said right, give notice thereof in writing to the sanitarv authority of the district in which the house is situated. 101 (2) Any company which neglects to comply with the foregoing provisions shall he liable to a fine not exceeding ten pounds, and it shall be the duty of the sanitary authority to take proceedings against any company in default. (3) This section shall apply to every water company which is a trading company supplying water for profit. On the 5th December, 1906, the Council decided to join in urging the Metropolitan Water Board to discontinue their practice of cutting off the water supply from premises upon which the water rate has not been paid and to substitute legal proceedings for the recovery of the rate where necessary. For the information of this Authority the Board have forwarded a copy of a Report of their Finance Committee on the subject. Metropolitan Water Board. Extract from Report of Finance Committee. 25th February, 1907. Withdrawal of Supplies. 1.—We have in the last few weeks received a number of letters from the Metropolitan Borough Councils and from Local Authorities outside London, on the subject of the disconnection of supplies consequtnt on non-payment of water rates, and suggesting that the Board should discontinue what is described as the practice of the Companies in this matter. We caused the actual facts of the case to be communicated to the Authorities in question, but in view of the public interest which is no doubt taken in this matter, we have thought that it would be convenient to also deal with the subject in our report to the Board. The communications from the Borough Councils and other Local Authorities originated in a resolution of the Islington Borough Council asking the Board to adopt legal proceedings instead of "cutting off," as a means of recovering water rates. In view of the statements which have been made in various quarters, it is, however, important to point out that by far the greater number of cutting-off cases have no connection whatever with non-payment of water rate (which was the only subject dealt with in the Islington resolution), but are attributable to cases where a remedy is required by the Engineering Department for defective or irregular fittings and waste of water. We are quite sure, from the information before us, that the Board's critics have overlooked this important fact, and have taken it for granted that substantially all cases of cutting-off are attributable to non-payment of rates. We, however, confine our attention in this report to the particular matter raised by the Islington resolution, viz., cutting off for non-payment. It is a fact, no doubt, that to some extent the Board are continuing the practice of the Metropolitan Water Companies in this matter, but we think there is an essential difference in the present practice, inasmuch as the power of cutting off for non-payment of rates is now very sparingly used, whereas with the Companies it was almost the only method of recovery. 102 We are fully alive to the objections against the practice of cutting off supplies, and our Sub-Committee, who examine the list of defaulters, at once recognised the force of the objections by instituting, as far as circumstances would permit, legal proceedings in lieu thereof, and arrangements are being made whereby summary proceedings for the recovery of arrears will be taken in the great majority of cases. Considerable administrative changes have had to be adopted in order to modify the practice of the Companies, and these are being carried out as rapidly as possible with the view of reducing the necessity of disconnecting supplies. We would, however, point out that the effect of our operations has been to considerably reduce the number of cutting-off notices issued, and that the process of reduction will be continued as rapidly as circumstances permit. We would suggest that if at any time the Local Authorities find that the disconnection of a supply is likely to occasion the slightest danger to the public health, they should direct their officials to communicate with the Board's officials, who would promptly act in concert with them in order to obviate the possibility of the danger referred to. Dealing with the present procedure, the facts are as follows:— No supply is cut off for non-payment of rates— (а) Without an order of the Committee after a full enquiry into the whole of the circumstances. (b) Where the premises are known to be occupied by more than one family. (c) Where inability to pay by reason of real poverty is established. (d) Where the owner and not the occupier is responsible by law or agreement for the payment of the water rate. We may add— (1) That the notice to "cut-off" is sent to both the Clerk and the Medical Officer of Health of the Local Authority concerned, instead of only to one of those officers as formerly. (2) That during the half-year ending Michaelmas, 1906, with 1,100,000 supplies, only 214 were withdrawn for non-payment of water-rate, and of these only about 150 were inhabited houses. (3) That with a view to giving the Local Authority information as to the reason of disconnection, we have arranged that the notices sent to them shall in future declare in all cases the reason for the withdrawal. In conclusion, we deem it advisable to call the attention of the Board to the appreciable loss of income which might result if "cutting-off" as a remedy for non-payment of rates were immediately and wholly abandoned.

This test is not only an odour test but also a sight test, and therefore renders the smoke test more or less unnecessary. The smoke test is, accordingly, reserved only for very exceptional cases when testing above-ground drainage such as soil-pipes, etc, separately. I may add that Kemp's test, as above described, is much more penetrating than smoke, and will disclose defects in moist ground, and also when the drain is fairly deep. With regard to the water test, the late Mr. Rogers Field, than whom no one had more experience, stated that a year or two after being laid, no drain would stand the water test unless it were constructed in iron surrounded by concrete. The water test in this Borough is, consequently, reserved mainly for new drains, and in these cases the main drain, the branches, and the chambers are thoroughly tested with water before being passed by the Inspector. In my Annual Reports under the heading of Drainage and Sewerage, it is stated each year, in detail, the mode of testing in six different circumstances bv four differing processes; in fact, a comple analysis of the method adopted. Also in my Annual Report for the year 1902, page 87, is a note upon the method of drain testing, and the circumstances in which it is necessary that the drains should be exposed for the purpose of ascertaining defects causing a nuisance. Drainage Bye-laws, regulating the size of Pipes.—Builders still continue to complain that they are allowed to put up a 3½in. soil pipe and a 3½in. vent pipe to ventilate a 4in. drain, but that if they ventilate a 4in. drain, not having a soil pipe but a branch W.C. drain on the same level, they are compelled to make the branch 4in. diam. and the vent pipe 4in. diam. In other words if the vertical vent pipe is the continuation of a 4in. horizontal drain it must be 4in. in diameter, but if to this vertical vent pipe a W.C. is connected it becomes a soil pipe, and may, together with the soil pipe, be reduced to 3½in. in diameter. A soil pipe is a direct continuation and part of a drain, that portion which is horizontal being called drain, and that which is vertical being called soil pipe, so that a soil pipe is a vertical drain, and should be subject to similar provisions. The anomaly was typically apparent in the case of the Teachers' House at All Saints School, Pancras Street, (see Plan No. 10270), where the Committee declined to take any action against the builder for putting up a 3iin. ventilating pipe to the drain, because the W.C. was on the basement level instead of the first floor. The continual irritation and annoyance caused by this anomaly is not experienced by the London County Council but by the Borough Council, which is the executive authority; and I feel sure that the London County Council would rectify the wrong upon the representation of the sufferers, if sufficient pressure were brought to bear. 105 A great amount of confusion and complaining would be avoided if a minimum diameter of 4in. were adopted for soil pipes in By-law 11, pars 5 and 2, or if a minimum diameter of 3½in. were adopted for drains in By-law 4, pars. 3, 0, and 10, and for vent pipes in By-law 8, par. 4. One of these alternatives should be adopted. Combined Drainage.—A communication was received from the Fulham Borough Council, forwarding copy of the following resolutions passed at a Conference of representatives of London Borough Councils held at the Fulham Town Hall on the 21st May, on the subject of combined drainage:— " (a) That this Conference of London Borough Councils do respectfully " urge the Right Hon. the President of the Local Government " Board to give the subject of the unsatisfactory state of the law " relating to combined drainage in London his serious considera" tion with the view of a Bill to amend the law being introduced " into Parliament at an early date. "(b) That a Deputation be formed to wait upon the President of the Local " Government Board in order to present the foregoing resolution " to him in person, and to urge the views of the Conference on the " subject matter. "(c) That the whole of the Delegates appointed to this Conference form " the proposed Deputation, and that the Councils of the City of " Westminster and the Metropolitan Boroughs of Battersea, " Chelsea, Greenwich, Stepney, and Wandsworth, be invited to " appoint representatives thereon. " (d) That the resolution passed by this Conference be embodied in the " form of a joint Memorial to the Local Government Board, setting " out the facts of the case, and that the several Metropolitan " Borough Councils represented by the Deputation be asked to " affix their Seals thereto when ready. " (e) That the terms of the proposed Memorial be referred to the Mayor " and Town Clerk of Fulham to settle." It was resolved the Seal of the Council be affixed to the joint Memorial to be presented to the Local Government Board on the subject of an amendment of the law in regard to combined drainage. § 8.—STORAGE & REMOVAL OF OFFENSIVE MATTERS. CLEANSING AND SCAVENGING. Dust Collection.—The increasing use of gas for cooking purposes is abolishing one of the most important functions of the kitchen range. The gas-stove is not likely to take the place of the kitchen range as a dust destructor and cremator, and this may prove a serious menace. The dustbin which is not fed also with ashes, which serve to absorb offensive matters, will become an intensified nuisance. Those who found it easier to empty their dust pans into the kitchen fire than to carry the dust to the bin, followed out the principle of destroying the germ-laden dust. If the question of burning the rubbish is 106 brought before the dweller in flats, in which gas stoves arc so largely used for cooking purposes, the answer is that the rubbish is taken away every morning. But there is an appalling accumulation of rubbish in the general receptacle which sooner or later becomes offensive. The tenants of the flat are thus at the mercy of the dust collector, and it is becoming an urgent matter that provision should be made for removing daily from the dustbins of flats the accumulated refuse of many dwellings. § 9.- NUISANCES, NOTICES, &c. Regent's Canal Water.—Specimens of water, taken from various parts of the Regent's Canal within the Borough, were sent for analysis to Sir Thomas Stevenson. The general tenor of his reports upon these specimens of water was that the water was sewege polluted, but that the contamination was not such as to cause a nuisance. Steam Whitles.—It may not be generally known that there is an Act, entitled "The Steam Whistles Act, 1872," in which it is provided as follows:— 2.—"No person shall use or employ in any manufactory, or any other place, any steam whistle or steam trumpet for the purpose of summoning or dismissing workmen or persons employed without the sanction of the Sanitary Authority ; and every person offending against this section shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding five pounds, and to a further penalty not exceeding forty shillings for every day during which such offence continues. Provided always, that the Sanitary Authority, in case they have sanctioned the use of any such instrument as aforesaid, may at any time revoke such sanction on giving one month s notice to the person using the same. Provided also, that it shall be lawful for the Local Government Board, on representation made to them by any person that he is prejudicially affected by such sanction, to revoke the same, and such revocation shall have the same force and effect as if it had been made by the Sanitary Authority. 3.—"Sanitary Authority" means the authority at the time being empowered to execute the Nuisance Removal Acts, as defined and extended by the Sanitary Act, 1886. 4.—"All offences and penalties under this Act may be prosecuted and recovered in England in manner directed by the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1848, and any Acts amending the same, and in Ireland." 107 The following is a list of steam whistles in use, so fur as can bo ascertained: — ST.

The dairies, cowsheds, and milkshops, the slaughterhouses, the places where raw foods are prepared, and the marketing places have been regularly visited and inspected. The markets and marketing streets have also been regularly visited on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings during the summer months. Bakehouses, restaurant kitchens, and similar workplaces fall under the Factory and Workshop Acts, and have been dealt with under Part IV. Defects in Dairies and Cowsheds Order. A case which came before the Stipendiary Magistrate at the police-court, Manchester, on October 5th, 1906, brought into prominence a shortcoming in the Dairies and Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, made under the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1894. A representative of the sanitary department of the Corporation stilted that the defendant was registered in respect of premises in Vine Street, but carried on his occupation elsewhere. There was no allegation that there was anything amiss with the premises in respect of which the defendant was not registered. It appears that the sanitary authority has hitherto been under the impression that diarymen had to be registered in respect of each place they occupied and that each place must be entered on the register. The stipendiary held that under the order a man may carry on the business of a cowkeeper without registration at all, apart from this particular Order. The Order imposes certain restrictions. One is that he shall be registered ; that is all. — A man is only liable to be registered for the place—in this case Manchester—in which he is entitled to carry on the business of cowkeeper. The summonses were dismissed.—" British Medical Journal," October 13th, 1906. § 2.—UN WHOLESOME FOOD. Dirty Milk.—In reference to the seizure of a churn of dirty milk at Euston Station on 20th February, 1906, of which a brief account was given in the Annual Report for 1905, at the begining of April, 1907, I wrote to the Editor of the " British Medical Journal " as follows: — "In the" British Medical Journal" of the 30th, ult., in a leading article under the head of ' The Tubercle Bacillus in Milk ' is mentioned a case which was decided at the Tower Bridge Police court on May 12th, 1905. The article reads as if the Corporation of London had been the prosecutors in the case. As a matter of fact, the prosecutors were the St. Pancras Borough Council, and the first hearing was at the Marylebone Police Court, but Mr. Chapman, the Magistrate, at the second hearing was back at his own Court at Tower Bridge and consequently the case was heard and decided there, far away from St. Pancras, so that it is not at all astonishing that it should have been looked upon as a City of London case. I should like to point out also that the milk in question was an obviously dirty milk, visibly dirty to the naked eye, and consequently the consignment was seized, taken to the Magistrate—who saw the milk himself—condemned as unfit 110 for human food on the opinion of the Medical Officer of Health, and destroyed, and that upon the facts the Borough Council decided to prosecute. Samples of the milk were collected from the scum and the deposit, and these were found to contain fœcal matter, pus cells, and tubercle bacilli, but the milk had already been condemned and destroyed before these had been demonstrated to be present. The point is that unless the milk is so obviously filthy to the naked eye that it can be seized on the spot, all milk can be transported and distributed with impunity, although some of it may contain fœcal matter, pus cells, and tubercle bacilli, because it takes time to find the fœcal matter, pus cells, and tubercle bacilli, and when found it is too late to stop the sale and distribution of the milk, so that the only remedy for this state of the law is to empower the Sanitary Authority that finds fœeal matter, pus cells, and tubercle bacilli in the milk to proceed against the wrong-doer within 28 days, as in the case of the Food and Drugs Adulteration Acts, and recover a thumping penalty. This is the only method, in my opinion, by which a wrong-doer can bebrought to a sense of his responsibility." Seizure of unsound Food.—In continuation of the paragraph upon this subject in the Annual Report for 1905, I quote the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 47.—Unsound Food. (8) Where a person has in his possession any article which is unsound or unwholesome or unfit for the food of man, he man, by written notice to the Sanitary Authority, specifying such article, and containing a sufficient identification of it, request its removal, and the Sanitary Authority shall cause it to be removed as if it were trade refuse. To this Section in his text hook is added the following Note by Alexander Mac Mor ran, m.a., k.c.— This is a new clause. It will take away the ground of a common defence in prosecutions for having unsound food in one's possession. It has very often been suggested that the food had been set aside with the intention of destroying it before it was seized. The power to give notice under this sub-section will now afford a test of bona fides when this line of defence is adopted. The Railway Carriage of Bottled Milk.—The following is an extract from the Annual Report for the year 19'J5 of the Intelligence Division of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries:— A communication was received from the proprietors of a creamery in Scotland, comparing the rates for bottled milk with the rates applied to the carriage of milk in churns, weight for weight. It was ascertained on enquiry that milk carried in bottles in cases was dealt with by the railway company concerned by weight and not by measure, and was charged half the ordinary parcels' rate, at owner's risk, with an additional charge for returned empties. The following shows the charges for the carriage of milk in bottles and milk in churns, respectively, for a distance of 21 miles at owner's risk— Milk in bottles in cases lOd. per ewt. (5 gals), containing 20 quart, bottles, weighing in the aggregate about 1 cwt. Returned empties 2d. each. Milk in butts or cans 6d. per cwt. (8 gals.). Returned empties Free. 111 The contention of the creamery proprietors was that at the same rate of carriage the conveyance of milk in bottles would be more profitable to the railway company, since there is less trouble in handling the cases, and the latter being flat may be arranged in tiers in a van. An economy of space is thereby effected which it is alleged more than compensates for the additional cost of haulage, while the customer benefits through receiving milk free from contamination and interference in transit. At the same time, the farmer would, it was stated, receive a slightly increased price for his milk, while the consumer would be charged no more than at present. It was also contended that the granting of the concession would cause a considerable increase in the trade in milk generally. The railway company concerned, on the other hand, maintained that it is no more trouble to carry milk in casks and cans than in bottles in cases, and that if the bottled milk trade increased it would probably be only at the expense of the existing milk trade, so that the new customers would be favoured at the expense of the old. The firm in question subsequently arranged for a motor service between the creamery and Glasgow, and no settlement of the question raised was arrived at. The Sealing of Charm for Railway Transport.—Board of Agriculture and Fisheries (Intelligence Division)—Extract from Annual Report for 1905:— The value of sealing churns as a protection against pilferage appears to depend largely on the pattern of churn used. The type which, owing to the simplicity of its lid, is apparently the most popular permits both the removal of milk and the addition of water without unsealing the churn. The protection afforded by sealing in such cases is therefore not complete, though the abstraction of milk would, in the case of a full churn, not be easy owing to its weight, some 2 cwt. There are, however, several makes of churns with lids so arranged that it would be very difficult to add any water to the milk without taking off the lid. In the case of milk sent by rail in such churns with the lid sealed there is very little risk of anyone attempting to abstract milk and make up the quantity by adding water. The attention of the Board was drawn by one of their Agricultural Correspondents to the fact that seals on milk churns sent from a certain station were being, in some instances, removed by the railway officials. On enquiry being made it appeared that the seals in question had been removed from churns which had not the tare stamped on them in the manner prescribed in the owner's risk rate conditions for the carriage of milk. Two cases where railway companies have detected persons stealing milk from their stations have been brought under the notice of the Board this vear. The traders regard these cases as showing that the check kept by the railway companies on the removal of milk from their stations is insufficient. The railway companies probably woulditake the view that they show that any cases of theft that occur are readily detected. Reference was made last year to the fact that small shortages in milk sent by rail might be caused by leakages in churns, and also that soap and rags were occasionally employed by farmers to stop such leakages. During the past summer a farmer in the neighbourhood of Liverpool was fined 29s., including costs, for stopping a leakage with soap. The Local Authority proceeded for breach of regulations made under Article 13 of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1885. 112 "NURSERY MILK." The two following reports, the first made on the 12th September and the second on the 12th December, 1906, are so important that in order to fully understand their bearings they must be quoted in exteniso:— Report of the Medical Officer of Health upon "Nursery Milk," 12th September, 1906. On the 25th July last the Borough Council approved of the recommendation of your Public Health Committee that, during the hot weather, thirty samples of milk should be examined bacteriologically. Accordingly, during the second and third weeks of August thirty specimens of Nursery Milk were procured, so as to comply as closely as possible with the intention of your Public Health Committee and the Borough Council to examine milk intended for " hand-fed infants of suckling age." In each case half a pint of milk was purchased, and drawn or poured directly into a bottle provided by the Inspector, each bottle having previously been thoroughly cleansed and repeatedly rinsed with hot and cold clean water, then with a cork tied round the neck, thoroughly sterilised by high pressure steam and hot air current in a disinfecting chamber, and corked in the chamber before being removed. These bottles, after cooling, were packed in ice in a portable metal case holding four bottles, and so carried to the places where the specimens of milk were purchased, and when filled and numbered were forthwith taken to the Bacteriological Laboratories at Guy's Hospital, and the bacteriological examinations were immediately commenced. In the two Appendices, lettered A and B, hereto attached, the results of the inquiry are tabulated. A describes the price and source of the specimen, and B gives the results of the bacteriological examination. This inquiry shows that, although Narsery Milk is advertised on hand-barrows, floats, carts, and shop windows, the number of firms selling genuine Nursery Milk which has been specially produced and particularly cared for are extremely few of the total of 466 dairymen registered in St. Pancras, and also that a large number of dairymen who do not advertise nursery milk and keep no special Nursery Milk, nevertheless supply an article which they admit they do not keep. The Inspectors also report that they have not seen any milk marked or labelled as " Nursery milk " delivered at any of the railway depots or stations in St. Pancras. The two main points apparent at first sight in the bacteriological examinations are (1) that two of the specimens contained tubercle bacilli, neither of which were from cowsheds in St. Pancras ; and (2) that the percentage of acidity was excessively high in most of the specimens drawn directly from cows in St. Pancras cowsheds. I attribute this largely to feeding the cows upon wet brewers' grains, which, by personal inspection of the cowsheds, I found to be undergoing secondary or acid fermentation, in the same manner as beer ferments into vinegar. I should imagine that such milk would not be beneficial to hand fed infants of suckling age, even if drawn directly from the cow into a perfectly clean bottle. 113 APPENDIX A. "NURSERY MILKS."

On the 3rd October last, when your Committee considered the Report dated 12th September upon the samples of " Nursery Milk " which it hud been decided to take for bacteriological examination, it was resolved by your Committee that eight further samples should be taken, two in each of four cowsheds in St. Pancras, with the object of ascertaining the condition of milk drawn without precautions, and of milk drawn with reasonable precautions, to secure cleanliness, so that some basis for a practical standard of cleanliness could be obtained. With this object in view the four best cowsheds ot the nine existing cowsheds in St. Pancras were selected and lettered A, B, C, and I). On the 9th October, four samples of milk were taken from cows in these four cowsheds under existing conditions, that is to say, at the usual milking time, the milker was asked to draw half-a-pint of milk directly from the teats into a sterilised bottle handed to him by the Inspector, after two or three strains had been drawn from the teat on to the ground so as to get rid of any organisms ill the outlet or ducts of the teat, the milking being done in the ordinary way in the stall in the cowshed. When the four samples had been collected in sterilised bottles, which were immediately packed in an ice jacketed receptacle, they were taken straight away to the laboratory and the bacteriological examination immediately commenced. The result of this examination was as fellows: — Cowshed Milks—First Series. October 8th, 1906. Cowshed. Volume of apparent filth per million. Nature of filth. The degree of acidity per cent. Number of living micro-orgamams per c. c. on gelatine at 20 deg. c.

That is to say in each case (1) the cow was groomed; (2) the udder was sponged over and dried with a clean cloth; (3) an open shed or part of the yard was washed down in preparation as a milking-place; (4) the cow was taken from the cowshed to the clean open milkiug-place, and a clean white loin cloth thrown over her, especially so as to cover the hollow of the flank where the head of the milker would rest; (5) the milker washed his hands and fore-arms in soap and water, put on a clean white smock, and a clean white cap, he was then asked to do as was done when taking the previous batch of samples without these precautions, namely, to draw half a-pint of milk directly from the teats into the sterilised bottle, after two or three strains had been drawn from the teat on to the ground so as to get rid of any organisms in the outlet or ducts of the teats. The samples were immediately packed in ice as before and sent straight away to the bacteriological laboratory when the examination was immediately commenced. The result of this examination was as follows :— Cowshed Milk—Second Series. November 7th and 8th, 1906. Cowshed. Volume of apparent filth per million. Nature of filth. The degree of acidity per cent. Number of living micro-organisms per c. c. on gelatine at 20 deg. c. A Less than 10 Neither pus cells, tubercle baecilli, nor streptococci could be detected. .248 About 3,000 B — No sample was taken at this cowshed, as there was no clean shed or yard available as a milking-place. C Less than 10 Neither pus cells, tubercle baccilli, nor streptococci present. .256 About 3,000 D 10 A few pus cells were present, but neither tubercle bacilli nor streptococci could be detected. .172 1,000,000,000 The large number of organisms found in the last sample D of the second series of cowshed milk was due to the condition of the cow produced by the clumsy rough manner in which she was treated, and to the uses to which the milker put his clean hands in patting the cow, rubbing the flanks, kneading the udder, wiping the buttocks, so that his hands must have again become much •contaminated before and during milking. 119 No sample was taken at cowshed B because there was no clean shed or yard available as a milking place, and the ordinary cowshed with the usual atmosphere and teeming microbes from disturbed litter, was quite an unfit place in which to expect a clean environment. In the old days it was customary to have milking sheds. In Jean Ingelow's poem of the High Tide on the coast of Lincolnshire, Elizabeth calls " come up Jetty — Jetty, to the milking-shed." I)r. Eyre, the bacteriologist, who has examined many milks drawn in different circumstances, assured me that the air of the ordinary cowshed contains an immense number of micro organisms, that the least disturbance of litter raises them in clouds, and numbers of these organisms get into milk drawn in cowsheds, and that to obtain cleanly drawn milk a cow must be milked in the open yard or in an open milking shed recently washed down. The numerous experiments of Messrs. A. L. Haeeker and C. \V. .Mellick (Nebraska State Bulletin, No. 87), the results of which were reported in "Public Health," September, 1906, page 703, also point straight to the same conclusion, namely, that milking in ordinary cowsheds " even when these are in the best condition," leads to the contamination of the milk. There remain the two samples from cowsheds C. and A. If the two samples from these cowsheds in the first series be compared with those in the second series, a great fall in the number of microbes per c.c. will be noticed, namely, from ten figures to four figures, and this is a measure of the difference of cleanliness in the two series. It will be observed in both series all the milks, except one, are nearly free from gross contamination or as it is termed " apparent filth," o or 10 parts per million parts in volume being an exceedingly small amount. It will be noticed that in both series all the milks contain an excess of acidity, due to the cows being fed upon wet brewers grains. So long as thesa grains are used to feed cows the milk of such animals is very liable to cause intestinal trouble to hand-fed infants of suckling age, and it is not desirable to recommend mothers in want of breast milk to feed their infants upon milk drawn from cows so fed in the St. Pancras cowsheds. In regard to the result of the examination of the sample in the first series from cowshed A, it states that "a few pus corpuscles" were found. There is some doubt about this, because this sample was drawn in a cowshed, whose owner takes most enlightened views, whose cattle are very fine, and kept in excellent health, who rents pasturage in one of the large open spaces of St. Pancras, and for exercise and change takes a certain number of his cows to and from the cowshed to the pasture daily. He is sending in plans to the London County Council for great improvements in his cowshed, and proposes to construct a special milking shed of four stalls, to keep a herd of Jersey cows only, and to supply milk specially for hand-fed infants of suckling age. He expresses his willingness to comform to regulations as to feeding, cleanliness, milking of the cows, etc., etc., and to carry out all the essential conditions necessary to produce a milk that can be recommended for handfed suckling infants. 120 Food destroyed.—The following food, unfit for human consumption, was destroyed during the year : — Date.

Unfortunately the second sample is not a sample of the inculpated milk, but it may in some measure be evidence of the bona or male fide* of the guarantor. WARRANTIES. The following cases show the position and the difficulties created by the setting up of warranties in defence of the adulteration of food, and is another of the many proofs of the necessity for the repeal of the warranty sections of the Sale of Foods and Drugs Acts.

(Before Lord Alverstone, L. C. J., Ridley and Darling, J. J.) Waits r. Stevens. Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875—Milk—Warranty—Connection between milk sold and the warranty given. As a defence to a summons for selling milk not of the quality demanded, the defendant set up a warranty given some months previously which was as follows :—" I guarantee that the milk supplied by me to Mr. Stevens is perfectly pure, and with all its cream us the cow gives it." Held, by Alverstone, L. C. J., and Darling, J. (Ridley, J., dissenting) that this was not a good defence, as there was not a sufficient connection between the warranty and the particular milk sold. This was a case stated by the Justices of Uxbridge on the hearing of an information under Section 6 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, charging the respondent Stevens with selling milk not of the nature, substance, and quality demanded, inusmuch as it contained 16 per cent, of added water. The milk was sold on December 28th( 1905. It had been supplied under one contract, but before the delivery of any milk, Mott had given or sent to the respondent a letter in the following terms :—" I guarantee that the milk supplied by me to Mr. Stevens is perfectly pure, and with all its cream as tlie cow gives it.—Francis Mott." Both Mott and the respondent intended this to be a continuinar warranty. The milk was sold under no warranty other 124 than the foregoing. The Justices held that the letter of August 5th, was intended by both parties to cover the delivery of the milk in question, and dismissed the information. Eustace Hills appeared for the appellant, an inspector under the Act; Douglas Hogg for the respondent. The Court allowed the appeal. Daki.ing, J., who delivered the first judgment, said that a warranty could be applied to goods not in existence at the time it was given. The question was whether one could gather that this particular can of milk when it was bought was bought under the warranty in question. It seemed to him that there was not a sufficient connection between the consignment in question and the warranty. He thought there must be established a connection between the particular article complained of and the warranty. No doubt the respondent would have had a remedy by action for breach of warranty, but there did not seem to him to be such a connection as was required by the provisions of Section 25. " Harris r. May " (i2 QB.D. 97) supported this view, and so did the " Farmers and Cleveland Dairy Company r. Stevens " (55 J.P. 407). He thought also that the cases of " Laidlaw v. Wilson" (1894, 1 Q.B. 74) and "Irving r. Callow Park Dairy Company" (87 L.T. 70) supported his view. It was contended that these eases were wrong, and were overruled by "Elliot c. Pilcher" (1901,2 K.B. 817). Tf they had to choose between them lie could not adopt the judgment in the latter case. He also thought " Elliot r. Pilcher " inconsistent with the later case of " Irving r. Callow Park Dairy Company" (supra) there was no good reason why a man should be allowed to rely upon a warranty given perhaps years before, for a consignor woidd be much more likely to be careless under those circumstances than he would be if each time he sent out a consignment of milk he had to make an affirmation that it was of good quality. This seemed a good reason to him for maintaining the older authorities. He thought that the appeal should be allowed. Ridley, J., was of opinion that the appeal ought to be dismissed, and that the later authorities were in favour of that view. Lokd Alverstone, L. C. J., agreed with Dari ing, J., that the appeal should be allowed, but he thought the matter was not free from doubt, and that the doubt ought to be set right by legislation. He thought there ought to be a written connection between the consignment and the warranty. The case of Elliot v. Pilcher (supra) went a great deal too far. Extract from "Public Health," November, 1900. (p. 108.) Milk Warranties.—At Old Street Police Court, on September 26th, John Roberts, milk dealer, of Wilson Street, Finsbury, was summoned for selling milk below the standard quality. Mr. Ricketts appeared for the defence ; Mr. Walton prosecuting for the Shoreditch Borough Council. Mr. Ricketts put in a warranty from Messrs. Marriage & Impey, wholesale contractors for milk supply. The warranty was for pure milk with all its cream, and was still unexpired. Mr. Cluer said that if there was no warranty with each parcel of milk delivered, the recent decision in the King's Bench of Watts r. Stevens made the warranty valueless. In an argument which followed it was made clear that the case quoted (L.J.K.B., June, 1906) over-rode a previous decision 125 in the ease of Elliot v. Pilcher, which recognised a general or running warranty as sufficient; Elliott r. Pilcher reversed a decision in a case of Harris r. May, which required a specific warranty—on a label with each churn delivered to the retailer—and now Elliot v. Pilcher is reversed and Harris r. May revived. Mr. Ricketts said his client was badly injured by the judgment, because when the offence for which he was now summoned occurred he was protected by the warranty, and, though the warranty was still running, it was abrogated by the law. Mr. C'lucr said he could only act 011 the judgment, and on previous convictions being proved he fined Roberts £3, and 23s. costs. Summonses.—Under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. No. of Sample.

The following arc the Reports of the Inspectors of Foo l Premises and of Food:— To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, 1 beg to report on my work in the Northern and Eastern Divisions of the Borough for the year ended December 31st, 1900, as Inspector of Food and Food places. Markets.—I made 1,740 inspections of the various market places, including stalls, and, when necessary, made applications to the Magistrates sitting at the butchers', pork butchers', poulterers', fishmongers, greengrocers', shops and Police Courts to condemn and order the destruction of certain unsound food. The following articles of food were destroyed, being unfit for the food of man:— 3 pigs. 2 sheep. 1 lamb. 17 lbs. of pieces (beef and mutton). 3 breasts of mutton. 6 cwt. of " offal." 2½ cwt. of skate. 2½ cwt. of cod. 1 cwt. of apples. ½ cwt. of pears. 2 barrels of grapes. Food Makers.—I have made 301 visits to the premises where sausages, ice <;ream, tripe, &c., .are made, and with few exceptions, found the premises satisfactory and the food sound. Licensed Slaughter-houses.—There are 8 private slaughter-houses in the division and I made 238 inspections, during which I saw 720 sheep, 81 bullocks, 131 pigs, 28 lambs, and 3 calves, killed and dressed, and such carcases and organs as on examination were found to be diseased I had removed, by the written request of the owners, under sub-section 8 of Section 47 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The following table shows the number of animals and organs found to be diseased, nature of disease, &c. 128 No. Description of Carcase. Disease. Where Affected. How disposed of. 1 Pig Tuberculosis Carcase and Organs Destroyed by burning at the Dust Destructor. 1 Ox ,, Liver ,, ,, 1 Ox Echinococcus ,, ,, ,, Veterinorum ,, ,, ,, 1 pig Abscess ,, ,, ,, 2 Oxen ,, ,, ,, ,, 1 Ox ,, Lungs ,, ,, 1 Ox Tuberculosis ,, ,, ,, 1 Ox Flukes Liver ,, ,, In addition to the above, a number of sheep's livers and lungs were affected with parasitical diseases and destroyed. Licensed Cow-sheds.—I paid 94 visits to the licensed cow-sheds (4) and on a few occasions I had to call the owners attention to the By-laws. At the last meeting of the Licensing Committee of the London County Council, I attended to support an objection to the renewal of one of the licences, raised by this Authority on my report as to the sheds not being used for cows ; the objection was accepted by the Committee and the license refused. Milkshops.—I made 521 inspections of milkshops, and, with few exceptions,, found the milk vessels generally satisfactory. During these visits I found 32 persons selling milk without being registered in accordance with the Dailies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Orders. Sale of Food anil Drugs Acts.—1 obtained 340 samples of articles of food and drugs for analysis by the Public Analyst under these Acts, of which 58 were adulterated. Of the samples of milk 42 were taken promiscuously at the St. Pancras (M.R.), Kentish Town (M.R.), and King's Cross (G.N.R.) stations, and only 3 were found to be slightly adulterated. Bacteriological Examination.—I took 10 samples of "nursery" milk for examination, also 7 samples direct from the cow into a bottle; for results please see Dr. Eyre's report. During the year I have attended before the magistrates at the Police Courts 95 times in the discharge of my duties. I am, Sir, yours obediently, Harry R. Child 129 To tlie Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to submit inv Annual Report for the year ended 31st December, 1906. Marki-ls.—The market streets, costers' barrows, stalls, fishsliops, and curing premises have been inspected daily ; 1794 inspections have been made, and the following articles of Food have been destroyed as unfit for human food :— 10 sheep's livers. 1½ cwt. fish. 1 carcase of a pig. 1 carcase of a lamb. 1 cwt. pomegranates. 2 cwt. skate. Food Mcker-s.— I have made 464 inspections of premises where food-stuffs are made, such as polonies, sausages, pies, etc., and have found the meat and other ingredients used sound and wholesome, and the premises generally clean. Slaughter-houses.—There are 13 slaughterhouses in my division which I have inspected 294 times and found them kept in accordance with the regulations of the London County Council. I have examined a large number of animals slaughtered, and found them free from disease and generally of first-class quality. Coir-sheds.—There are five licensed cow-sheds registered to keep 102 cows 120 inspections have been made, and the premises have been found in a cleanly condition generally, and the London County Council by-laws observed. There has not been any disease among the animals. Milkshops.—I have made 243 inspections of the registered milkshops and dairies and found the utensils and premises generally kept in a fairly clean condition. The small general shops selling milk are not so clean as the larger dairy shops which deal only in dairy produce. Food 8f Drays Arts. —I have submitted 340 samples of food to the Public Analyst for analysis, and four samples of water from the Regent's Canal (for results see report of Sir Thomas Stevenson, Public Analyst). Bacteriological Examination.— I have submitted 17 samples of milk for examination (for results see Dr. Eyre's reports). Milk Adulteration by Middlemen.—O. B., Dairyman and Purveyor of Milk, selling dairy produce only at his shop has a milk round, and supplies small . shops. I sampled 0. B.'s milk and that of two shops supplied bv him in the same street, on the same afternoon, with the following results :— 1. - Sample taken from O.B. at his shop, certified as genuine. 2.—Sample taken at small shop (a) supplied by O.B., certified 7 per cent, uf milk fat abstracted. Fine i!2, costs 12s. 6d. 130 3.—-Sample taken at small shop (b) supplied by certified 7 per cent, of milk fat abstracted and 1 per cent, of added water. Fine £2, costs 12s. 6d. These samples were taken on the same afternoon, one after the other, in the above order. The small shops supplied by O. B. sell about one gallon of mil leper day. 1 was told by the keepers of the small shops (a) and (6) that 0. B. paid both the fines. It would seem as if the milk of the original vendor was sold pure but that the milk sold to the smaller vendors was adulterated. I have had suspicion of this method of adulteration in other cases but this one was most clearly proved. Legal Proceedings.—I have attended the Police Court 57 times in connection with my duties as prosecuting Food Inspector, an increase of 11 as compared with the year 1905. I am, Sir, Yours obediently, J. Osborne, Meat and Food Inspector. Canal Boats Act. To the Medical < )fficer of Ilealth. Sir, During the year I have inspected 52 dwelling boats, and only in two cases was there any infringement of the .Vet. Notices were served and complied with. There has not been any infectious diseas3 or other illness on any of the boats inspected, and the regulations have been fairly well observed by the boat dwellers. I am, Sir, yours obediently, J. Osborne, Canal /foots Inspector. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to submit my report for 1906. Disinfection. 1,068 rooms were sprayed and fumigated after cases of infectious disease. The spraying of the surfaces of the rooms has again given all-round satisfaction, and no complaints have been made. 329 articles were destroyed by fire with the owners' consent, 32,985 articles were disinfected by steam, and 4,850 were fumigated in the specially prepared fumigating chamber. 406 articles were removed from premises in a verminous condition to be dealt with at the station. Personal Cleansing House. The necessary alterations having been completed, a new attendant was appointed, and the Children's Baths, as altered, were opened on June 1st. 1,U87 children enjoyed the baths. Some of the children made anxious 131 enquiries as to whether they would be allowed to attend the baths during the summer holidays, and the attendance dming that period was well maintained. On the first attendance of a child at the baths the clothing is steamed, and on subsequent visits the attendant uses her discretion as to whether the clothing requires steaming or not. During the cold weather hot cocoa was provided, which was eagerly looked forward to by the children. 1,314 adults attended during the year. In each case the clothing was steamed. A very few women (30 availed themselves of the accommodation provided, notwithstanding that leaflets were sent to Common Lodging Houses and places frequented by the class these baths were provided for. Food Inspection. I procured 70 samples of food under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and made 380 inspections of Market Streets. I also visited Milkshops, Dairies, Ice Cream places, Cowsheds and Slaughterhouses in parts of Wards 3 and 6. Periodical Inspections. I made the usual inspections of Bakehouses, Registered Tenement Houses, Workshops, Factories, &c., and served notices when necessary. I am, yours faithfully, W. G. Auger. VI-LEGISLATION. § 1—GENERAL ACTS. Aliens Act, 1905 [5 Edic. 7, Ch. 13]. This Act created Immigration Boards and empowers them to prevent the landing of undesirable immigrants, including any immigrant who " owing to any disease or infirmity appears likely to become a charge upon the rates or otherwise a detriment to the public." It also authorises the Secretary of State to make rules with respect to Immigration Boards and their Officers and their administration, and to make expulsion orders for certain offences committed by aliens. § 2.—LOCAL ACTS. The London County Council (General Powers) Act of 1906 contained no clauses specially relating to health matters. j 3.-ORDERS. Sanitary Conveniences in Factories and Workshops. Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. 9.—(1) Every factory and workshop must be provided with sufficient and suitable accommodation in the way of sanitary conveniences, regard being had to the number of persons employed in or in attendance at the factory or workshop, and also where persons of both sexes are or are intended to be employed or in attendance, with proper separate accommodation for persons of each sex. 132 (2) The Secretary of State (a) shall, by Special Order, determine what is sufficient and suitable accommodation within the meaning of this Section.

(1) of this Section. STATUTORY RULES AND ORDERS, 1903. No. 89. Factory and Workshop. Sanitary Accommodation. The Sanitary Accommodation Order of 4th February, 1903. In pursuance of Section 9 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, I hereby determine that the accommodation in the way of sanitary conveniences provided in a factory or workshop shall be deemed to be sufficient and suitable within the meaning of the said section if the following conditions are complied with, and not otherwise :— 1. In factories or workshops where females are employed or in attendancethere shall be one sanitary convenience for every 25 females. In factories or workshops where males are employed or in attendance there shall be one sanitary convenience for every 25 males: provided that— (a) in factories or workshops where the number of males employed or in attendance exceeds 100, and sufficient urinal accommodation is also provided, it shall be sufficient if there is one sanitary convenience for every 25 males up to the first 100, and one for every 40 after ; (b) in factories or workshops where the number of males employed or in attendance exceeds 5 0, and the District Inspector of Factories certifies in writing that by means of a check system, or otherwise, proper supervision and control in regard to the use of the conveniences are exercised by officers specially appointed for that purpose it shall be sufficient if one sanitary convenience is provided for every 60 males, in addition to sufficient urinal accommodation.

Every sanitary convenience shall be under cover and so partitioned off as to secure privacy, and if for the use of females shall have a proper door and fastenings. 4. The sanitary conveniences in a factory or workshop shall be so arranged and maintained as to be conveniently accessible to all persons employed therein at all times during their employment. 5.

Metropolitan Industrial Dwellings Co. r. Long. By-laws—Drains - Water-closets — " Construction of water-closet " — Ventilation of trap of water-closet —Extension of by- laws to existing buildings Metropo is Management Act, 1855 (18 and 19 Vict. c. 120), s. 202 — Public Health (London) Act, 189, (54 and 55 Vict. c. 76), s. 39. ii. series of by-laws were made by the London County Council under the provisions of section 202 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, giving power to make by-laws for regulating the dimensions, mode of construction, itc., of " the pipes, drains, and other means of communicating with sewers, and the traps and apparatus connected therewith." No. 17 of these by-laws provided that every person who should "construct any water closet," of which the soil pipe fulfilled certain conditions, should cause the trap of the water-closet to be ventilated in a particular manner. No. 21 of the by-laws was as follows : " These by-laws shall, so far as practicable, apply to any person who shall construct or reconstruct any pipe or drain or other means of communicating with sewers, or any trap or apparatus connected therewith, so far he shall effect any such works in any building erected before the confirmation of these by-laws, as if the same were being constructed in a building newly erected." The appellants, who were owners of a building erected before the confirmation of the by-laws, reconstructed and replaced the pans and traps of several waterclosets in the building, which had been broken in the course of alteration they were carrying out in the drains connecting the soil pipes of the closets with the sewer, or in the course of ordinary wear and tear. The soil pipes of the water-closets were of the character contemplated by by-law 17. Held—1. That the by-laws were neither ultra-vires nor unreasonable. 2. That the work done by the appellants was not the construction of water-closets within by-law 17 ; and that by-law 21 did not impose on a person who constructed or reconstructed the pan or trap of a water-closet, but did not construct a water-closet, the obligation of complying with by-law 17 as to the ventilation of the trap. Semht.e, that a by-law imposing that obligation in such a case would be intra vires, and not unreasonable.

C.—Infants. 1.—That, having regard to the ascertained fact that in centres of industries where women are largely employed awav from their homes an excessive number of deaths of infants take place, and that this is contributed to by the improper conditions existing at the houses in which infants are placed out to nurse, it is necessary that the persons by whom, and the places into which, infants are received, should be under supervision by th? Local Sanitary Authority. 2.—That the Infant Life Protection Act be amended to remedy abuses which are not at present provided against. 3.—That, in the opinion of this Conference, the question of the insurance of infant lives under twelve months is one demanding serious consideration, and, with a view to receiving reliable information, the Government should be asked to appoint a Departmental Committee of Inquiry on the whole question. D.—Milk. 1.—That, in the opinion of this Conference, immediate legislation is required enabling Sanitary Authorities to establish or support depots for the supply of pure, or modified, or sterilized milk, and to defray any cost out of the monies available for public health purposes. 2.—That the Dairies, Milkshops, and Cowsheds Order is defective, and that any amendment should extend the definition ot' disease as applied to animals, and should make the provision of regulations by local authorities compulsory. That the scope of the regulations should be extended to cover dirty milk, and should enable Local Authorities to prohibit the sale of any milk which fails to comply with the conditions of purity agreed upon. 3.—That all preparations offered or sold as food for infants should be certified by a Government Analyst as non-injurious, and that each packet should contain its analysis. E.—Schools. That the Education Department be urged to add instruction in Elementary Hygiene with reference to the dietary and rearing of infants to their present scheme for systematically training girls in the senior classes in the practice and principles of personal hygiene and the elements of dietary. F.—Midwives. That, in the opinion of this Conference, the Midwives Act, 1902, should be extended to Scotland and Ireland. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, JOHN F. J.
