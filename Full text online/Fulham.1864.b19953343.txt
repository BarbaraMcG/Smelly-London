NINTH ANNUAL REPORT, Pursuant to the 198th section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855 The Board of Works for the Fulham District report that they have prepared an Abstract of their Receipts and Expenditure for the past year, which, together with an Abstract of Contracts, and the Ninth Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health, they have ordered to be published. The number of nuisance cases removed during the year, is: Privies and Cesspools emptied 266 Drains and Gullies Cleansed and Repaired 238 Houses ditto ditto 330 Swine Nuisances Removed 43 Miscellaneous 115 Total 092 Houses benefited in Fulham 718 „ „ Hammersmith 679 Total 1497 The Board inform their Constituents that the Metropolitan Board of Works, pursuant to arrangement, have paid over the sum of £1550, referred to in the last Annual Report. During the past year the Board have taken up the sum of £20,000 lent by the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation, and Abstracts of the mortgages thereon are hereto annexed. By means of these loans they have been enabled to rapidly progress with the construction of sewers as under: Brook Green Sewer, from the Shepherd's Bush Road to the High Road at Mr.Hunt's Corner; King Street East Sewer, from the Broadway to the point of Junction with the Brook Green Sewer at Mr. Hurst's corner; Walham Green Sewer, from North End to Walham Green; Sun Street Sewer; and Parson's Green Lane Sewer. The Board hope that with the balance of loan (£19,018) yet to be taken up, to provide and have in active operation, a most efficient system of drainage throughout the District before the time when they will be called upon to present another annual report. 6 They have had frequently to bring under the attention of the Metropolitan Board the necessity of their completing the outlet at Sand's End; of making the connexion between the North End Sewer & the Low Level Sewer at Walham Green; also of making the Stamford Brook Diversion Sewer; and they expect that before the close of the current year all these important works will be completed. The Board trust, that, in proportion as the drainage of the district is completed, great alterations will be effected in the sanitary condition of the densely populated localities, where a very poor class of house property exists, by doing away with cesspools, defective surface drains, and enforcing the supply of water to closets, whereby they may expect an improved state of public health. The Board have much pleasure in stating that they have been able to make a large reduction iu the cost of repair and management of those roads formerly under the jurisdiction of the Metropolis Trust Commissioners, and consequently the General Kate for the current year will be considerably reduced. Abstract of Contracts entered into by the Board during the year ending 25th March, 18G5. Mr. Chalker, for paving and masonry works, at certain prices set forth in the schedule, and embodied in the contract. Mrs, Coat, for works of cartage, at per day of 10 hours, in strong and wellmade carts, each attended by one man, and drawn by one horse, 7s. per day ; or, at the option of the Board,at 1s. per journey, average to or from any part of the district, the man attending to assist in loading the cart. Mr. Turner, for the supply of the best gray pit flints, at 5s. Ad. per cube yard, and for best blue broken Guernsey granite, at 12s. 9d. per cube yard. Mr, J. Beaven, for the removal of dust, ashes, &c., from the several houses, yards, and premises, in the parish of Hammersmith, for 12 months, he paying for the same, £160.

Gentlemen, The Registrar General, in his Annual Report for 1864, whilst speakin of the five great groups of districts into which he has divided the Metropolis area, i.e., East, Central, North, West, and South Districts, shews the natur; influence of density of population on the death rate of a people ; for whilst ??? mortality of the two former groups in 1864 was 2.9 percent, that in the th???. latter was about 2.5 per cent., and again, in a further subdivision of the three latter, he says "but the first (West) of these groups was the healthies perhaps because the people who live in it may enjoy on the whole the ample provision of food, fuel, clothing, and house shelter against inclement seasons These distinctive features are, however, I fear, in much danger of serio??? modification for the future. In watching the enormous accession of popul tion to the Fulham district for instance, one cannot otherwise than observe t??? constant tendency to over crowding amongst the labouring people, whilst then seems every probability of this human tide increasing. The tremendo??? demolition of the houses hitherto occupied by the working classes more in mediately in London itself, has dislodged thousands of families, whilst n systematized provision, except of a most infinitesimal character, has been mad for their reception. Railways and their approaches, Joint-stock Hotels an Banks, enormous Warehouses and Emporiums of trade, fine buildings of ever kind both public and private, street improvements, and a hundred other undertakings are each carrying on a levelling process in the heart of th Metropolis, and the inhabitants seek shelter necessarily in the suburb??? From these causes and railway facilities, the parishes of Hammersmith an Fulham have both received a flood of immigrants of a character too likely ??? add, not only to our sickness and death rate, but also too surely to the loca poor rate. Burthens then both sanitary and financial will more than probably fall to our lot, for, whilst the labour of "the million" is devoted to the enrichment of others, the task of housing and that of providing for the sick and needy will be ours. The question therefore of an equalization of the Metropolitan Poor Rate stands out in strong relation to its sanitary bearings. The close connection between poverty and over crowding with typhus fever and other pestilences, is now too well known to require more than reference to it, and hence, unless some general provision be made for such contingencies by a common Metropolitan charge, the amount of our local taxation for the proper maintenance of the poor, must become manifestly unjust, or prove, as is most likely, totally inadequate. But though financially we may be lukewarm in our action upon this subject, its sanitary features demand imperatively most watchful care. We must not, indeed we dare not look at it with indiflerence. The evils of insufficient house accommodation for the lower classes, 11 her words of over-crowding, are far too cogent to admit of apathy, and if Workmen's Trains " are to become part and parcel of our Metropolitan ??? system, assuredly neither Fulham nor Hammersmith will escape an ??? accession to their working population. There is a natural reckless- amongst the poor themselves, even where moderate numbers are found in c???. Purity of air in their apartments has little charm for them devided they secure warmth without the cost of fuel, and in very ignorance burn as it were the fatal carbon of their own exhalations. The prospect ckness and disease is shut out from sight in the necessities of the moment, fold-up bedstead, the sack-closed chimney, the listed window-sill, and treated bedding, carrying poison in their wake, are the common lot of thouwhilst want of personal cleanliness too constantly accompanies them, hall tell in ordinary times most painfully on the welfare of a community, when a prospect of their aggravation is apparent some steps surely should taken to avert the consequences. The improvement of the dwellings of the in both the parishes of the Fulham District is a matter well worthy the ???ration of the better class of residents. The erection of Model Lodging•and the improvement of Cottage property have always proved more or remunerative, and instances of the latter may indeed be found within this ??? but even were it otherwise, the cost of maintenance could easily be ???tained, whilst the enormous sacrifice of life and health, and money too, present, cannot be calculated. The general mortality of London in 1864, has been high, as indeed has ??? the case throughout the country districts. The Meteorological conditions ??? year have not been favourable to health. The mean temperature has ??? low, hence diseases of the respiratory organs have contributed largely to number of deaths, whilst the marked diminution in the usual amount of ??? registered has also influenced the effects of Zymotic diseases. The ???movement of the air has been unusually small, and the amount of much below the average. The total Mortality of the Fulham District has been 1137, of which Coti???ption and other diseases of the organs of Respiration (independently of ???p) have contributed 315 deaths, whilst Miasmatic diseases, including ???rs, Small Fox, Measles, Whooping Cough, Croup, Scarlatina, Diptheria, Diarrhoea, have given 247. The number of deaths arising from these latter bases, have been respectively:—Fever (Continued, Typhus, and Typhoid) Small Pox 6, Measles 27, Whooping Cough 27, Croup 13, Scarlatina 56, ???eria 12, Diarrhoea 66, Carbuncle 1, and Cholera 1. Consumption has ???ed 1 13 deaths ; it must not however be supposed that this is the natural th-rate of the district from this disease, since many cases of it in its various ???es are imported into suburban, from town localities, under the hope of ???fit from purer air. The different forms of Pneumonia and Bronchitis have ???duced 205 deaths, and of these 94 occurred in January, February, and ???ch. During these months the temperature of the air was exceedingly ???ble, the alternations from unusual heat to excessive cold, being many and ??? telling seriously on chest affections. The highest monthly mortality the year occurred in January (127), and March (124). Infant Mortality as usual comes in with its heavy blow, to swell the number of lives lost to us. In 1864 no less than 490, or nearly one half of total deaths, were those of children who had hot attained their fifth year and 283 of these hail not reached one year old. This fearful and per???ly unnatural loss of infant life, is viewed with too little interest b\ the 12 public at large, for though in sanitary returns it is from year to year pr??? nently referred to, both as regards town and rural districts, neither legislature nor the people seem alive to its growing importance to this co??? No one seems willing to look at this subject with more than passing inte??? or to calculate even the money loss which such an avoidable sacrifice of??? entails. I have in almost all my annual Reports drawn attention to??? general condition of the infant population of the cottage homes within Fulham district, and I cannot omit again to say that something should done by public effort to palliate the wretched and neglected state in which many hundred children may at any time be found amongst us. I would nestly and especially entreat the watchfulness of our clergy of all denominal??? to this subject, and urge them to seek for the early training of these ha??? little ones, before the seeds of vice and sickness and future misery, have he??? to germinate. There is in both these parishes full scope for the most a??? energy in this direction. It has its sunitary as well as its moral aspect; ??? dirt and filth in which the houses of the poor are sometimes found, a??? many instances directly consequent on the neglected and unguarded sta???. which these wretched children exist from day to day. Totally uncared fo??? their parents, and with no friendly arm stretched out to help them, they ra??? in destructiveness and filthy habits, of which Wheatsheaf Alley and ??? similar spots offer too constant evidence. The number of Births registered in the year have been 1461 ; in H??? mersmith 820, in Fulham 641, giving an excessof births over deaths of ???. 61 deaths have occurred in the Union House, 47 in Roman Catholic Inst??? tions, 11 in Alms Houses, and 11 in Lunatic Asylums. G3 Inquests ??? been held. In the early part of the year, Fever prevailed in Willow Place and neighbourhood of Munden Street, where 8 deaths occurred. There did appear to be any direct cause for the outbreak, though I am of opinion the soil on which the houses of the lower classes in this immediate locality; built, is not of the most wholesome character. This is I am convinced frequent source of sickness where no other evident cause is manifested. 1 h??? frequently in my Reports, referred to the practice of excavating for br??? earth on ground intended for building purposes, and of the filling in with re??? of any kind that can be obtained either cheap or without cost to the build The settling of Fever in many spots continually, can in my opinion be cle??? traced to this cause, and hence the difficulty of fully eradicating such dis??? from them by the ordinary sanitary measures Emanations the result gradual and continuous decomposition sap the health of the inhabitants ??? sure and unerring steps. The removal of the clay is not without its advantage but these are more than counterbalanced by the pernicious influence of ??? Scavenger's Cart, and that objectionable but too common notice, "Rubbish ??? be shot here". I am so deeply impressed with the importance of this sub??? to the public health, that I am constrained again to draw attention to it. In the latter part of 18G4 Small Pox was prevalent to a very consider??? extent in the adjoining Parish of Chiswick, and as was more or less to be ??? pected from its proximity, the disease eventually spread to the Western p??? of Hammersmith, 3 deaths occurring in December from it. Several cases the disease have occurred since, though the mortality has not been seri??? As usual unvaccinated persons have been the means of spreading the infec??? in different localities, from their increased susceptibility to the Epidem 13 ???cc, and in those the cases have been more severe and fatal. The vac???ded however have not escaped. Several adults as well as children who have ???rgone this operation in early life have been affected, though with more or ???nodification of intensity. This circumstance would probably tend to shake ??? confidence in the prophylactic influence of vaccination, were it not capable ??? planation, in the fact that vaccination is not performed to that extent ??? assuredly is necessary to its full protective power. There is a prejudice ???ring still amongst the public of all ranksand classes against a free insertion of ???ccine Virus. The great desire on the part of Parents is as a rule, to have ??? effect as possible produced,rather than as much as experience has proved ???consistent with security. Two causes are in operation to produce this result. ??? the anxiety not to have what appears to them an unnecessary amount of ???shmcnt inflicted on the child; and, secondly the not unnatural fear lest ???uld be the means of propagating constitutional maladies from child to ??? It would be improper in this place to discuss the latter question, but ??? necessary for the public mind to be assured that experience does not favor ??? a supposition; it teaches us moreover that with proper care such appre???ions need not be entertained, and that when carried to a due extent, ???ination does afford a manifest protection against the ravages of Small Pox. ???The Compulsory Vaccination Act even amended as it has been, fails to ???uce its anticipated good. Like almost every other Statute affecting personal ???ty and self control, a reluctance to comply with its provision by many ???exists, whilst the imperfections in its practical application have required ??? to illustrate. The Medical Officer of the Privy Council has reported to ??? body, "that the laws now in force for the purpose of extirpating Small ??? are not likely to accomplish their object, and that the system established ???aw for the provision of Public Vaccination, works in an unsatisfactory ???ner." ??? In a recent report of the Epidemiological Society of London, they say that ??? very large majority of deaths from Small Pox is in young unvaccinated ???dren, but there is, especially at Epidemic periods, a considerable mortality ???ng imperfectly vaccinated adults." Mr. Marson, the Surgeon of the Small ??? Hospital, also states "that out of 123 deaths from Small Pox in 1863, in ???eons who had been vaccinated, in only 3 had the vaccination been such as ???persons ought to receive for their ordinary protection, and that while the ???tality in the hospital among the unvaccinated Patients was at the rate of ???her cant., and among the imperfectly vaccinated 15 per cent., less than 1 per ???of those admitted who had been properly vaccinated, succumbed to the ???ase." ??? The Epidemiological Society therefore justly urge that " Nothing can be ???e certain than that if all were thoroughly well vaccinated in early infancy, ???ll Pox might be nearly banished from our death registers." The supply of water for domestic purposes within the District, is still ???cient and unsatisfactory. No new mains have been laid down by the Water ???panies, and though the attention of the Government has been drawn to the ???cts of the existing law, on this and other important sanitary questions, no ???ement has been made in Parliament for the amendment either of the ???polis Local Management Act, or Nuisances Removal Act, in this respect. The powers at present given by the Statutes for enforcing a supply of ??? for domestic use, are within the Fulham District all but inoperative. The 14 cry amongst the Cottagers is still for Water, Water, without which all ??? sanitary appliances are at the best abortive, without which in ample continuous flow, no community can he preserved in healthfulness. On essential will depend the perfect working of our deep and costly Sewers this alone will hang success in minor drainage matters. Water, that first most important element of health and cleanliness, exists in name alone in ??? of our cottage property here, and consequently neither purity of person ??? dwelling can be ensured. I would therefore again respectfully urge ??? Board to memorialize the Government in pressing terms, for amendment ??? laws on this all important question, as well as for other alterations in the ??? tary Statutes, to which I have more than once alluded in my previous Repo??? I deem it a matter of some importance to draw the attention of your B??? to a late decision of Vice-Chancellor Sir W. P. Wood, in the cause of "??? Attorney General at the relation of the Conservators of the River Thames, ??? Mayor, Aldermen,& Corporation of Kingstonon Thames," as one vitallyaffec ??? the future purity of the water of that river, at the point from the neighbour ??? of which the Metropolitan supply is obtained, as well as to the influence it ??? have on its condition, when the rapidly increasing sewage of various large ??? growing towns higher up its course, shall in like manner be poured into ??? The Slaughter-houses and Cow-sheds in the District have been regu ??? inspected, and are generally in an improved and satisfactory condition. Bake-houses have also been visited from time to time, and much improven??? in their general management has been effected under the Bake-house Reg??? tion Act. The provisions of this Statute have proved most acceptable ??? beneficial to the journeymen bakers, and with one or two exceptions, Masters have shown a willingness to acquiesce in its requirements. A lo??? rooted custom in the trade of carrying on the manufacture of bread during ??? night, requires time to eradicate, but it is much to be hoped that a sys??? which has worked so much unnecessary misery and disease in a hard-work??? class of the community, will eventually give way to enlightenment ??? humanity. Indeed there is no injustice to any one in the effort to accomp??? an improvement in the condition of the journeyman baker. The inspect and supervision of the Bake-houses carries with it no more hardship than ??? attending the control of the Slaughter-houses and Cow-houses, or the visit??? the Exciseman on behalf of the Revenue ; neither is there any unjust in??? ference with the liberty of the subject, for although every man is presumed have a right to do what he likes with his own which is not morally wrony, neit??? the freedom of one nor even of many classes is consistent with a manifest ??? palpable injury to another. The Factory Act has oppressed no one, but ??? worked a wonderful good ; a temperate carrying out of the Bake-ho??? Regulation Act will not be without results. It may not be an unfitting occasion here to draw the attention of y??? Board to what has always been an opprobrium to Hammersmith. Notw??? standing all the improvements in the local Sewerage already effected ??? proposed for future accomplishment, nothing as far as I am aware is cont??? plated for the abolition of one of the most flagrant public nuisances existi in the district. The late Commissioners of Sewers constructed the Albion R??? Sewer some ten years since, leaving the Creek intact. The present Metropo??? Board have completed the Western intercepting Sewer at this point, but I Creek remains in all its filthiness and unwholesomeness, pouring silently 15 ???ious vapours into the very centre of the town. Periodical cleansings have ???a and may still be carried on, expensive limeing processes have been and n' still be had recourse to, but nothing in my opinion can be effective but ???entire sweeping away of this vast quagmire of offensiveness. The gaping ???hs of local house drains, the overflow from privies now reeking with pest???tial influence over its banks, should be otherwise provided for, and some ???e harmless though not unprofitable use be made of this hitherto malarious Now the receptacle of almost every kind of filth and refuse, and giving to wide spread mischief, one of the most valuable means of health may be ???le to centre in it. Here is an admirable spot for Baths and Washhouses ???all classes, here a swimming bath of almost any extent may be provided ??? a daily and costless supply of water from the river, whilst no frontage ???rs more manifest advantages for a Town or Vestry Hall. An improvement ???he mouth of the Creek and the adjoining river side may be made to more ??? compensate for Wharfage rights, and thus one of the greatest boons to ???lic health be happily secured.
