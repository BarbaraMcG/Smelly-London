WHI 45 THE ANNUAL REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, (now incorporated with other districts and together with them known as the METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF STEPNEY), (with vital and other statistics), FOR THE YEAR 1900, (CONSISTING OF 52 WEEKS) by JOSEPH LOANE, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH; diplomate in public health of the university of cambridge fellow of the incorporated society of medical officers of health ; member of the sanitary institute ; public vaccinator to the whitechapel union ; examiner in, and instructor of, vaccination, by order of the local government board, &c. LONDON: PENNY AND HULL, PRINTERS, LEMAN STREET, E 1901. Presented to the General Purposes Committee on the 14th January, 1901. Offices of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney, Whitechapel Area (including Wapping). Public Health Department: No. 15, Great Alie Street, London, E. January 11h, 19091. To the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney, Gentlemen, The Metropolitan Borough of Stepney was inaugurated last November. To-day I have received from your Acting Clerk a printed circular which contains the names of certain officers belonging to the late Boards and Vestries now forming the Borough of Stepney, whose offices are to be abolished at a date not later than March 25th, 1901. I am included in that list. Notwithstanding this fact, I am preparing a Report upon the Sanitary Condition of the area which, until recently, was known as The Whitechapel District. One reason for the compilation of this Report is, that I am under a statutory responsibility to do so, but were this not the case I should still feel it to be my duty, because by no other means could all the information herein contained be forthcoming: a break in the continuity of recorded work would thus take place which might cause my successors some annoyance and trouble. I cannot leave the work which, for a period of eighteen years, I have carried on, without a few remarks concerning the changes which I have seen within the District during that time. Probably no other part of London has exchanged so many old and wornout houses for new buildings during that period than Whitechapel; certainly very few parts can have surpassed us in the number of large drainage improvements which have been devised and carried out by my staff. This work I look back to as having been, perhaps, our most important addition to the various improvements which have taken place. Then, again, for the past ten years there has been a systematic attempt to get details of every house upon a Register, and at the present time 4,250 such houses are entered in the 16 volumes comprising the Registers. When I mention that every house when inspected had its drains tested, and where faulty had improved or new drains substituted; that all defective traps were replaced by traps of a modern pattern; and that the houses themselves were, if necessary, cleansed and repaired, you will readily perceive that some reasons are adduced to logically account for the huge reduction irl death rate which has taken place during the time I have had the pleasure of being Sanitary Adviser to the late Board of Works for the Whitechapel District. At the end of this brief valedictory preface I append a copy of the first page of the first Register. When I took charge there were two Inspectors only employed by the Board, and I have often wondered at the marvellous energy they displayed in their continuous uphill work. Then were the years of small-pox and typhus fever, 4 with, in 1866, a sharp outbreak of cholera. Tt would appear that each addition to the Sanitary Staff has resulted in considerable improvement in the sanitation of the District, and a corresponding diminution in the death-rate. Have the ratepayers not received splendid value for their outlay ? I scarcely care to speak of my own work, but I have, from my initial start, made a point of knowing every week from what diseases our people were mostly suffering, and to what causes the deaths were attributable. This information was first obtained by extracting, every week, from the District Medical Officers' Books particulars of every case. I assumed that this information guided me to a knowledge of the sickness likely to be present among persons belonging to a. different grade in life. Upon sheets specially constructed to take each year's work, I set out every week full details of all deaths and other particulars likely to assist me in learning what I required to know to enable me to fight the battle which I set myself to fight. Every day I myself copied, upon my own Office List, every case of infectious disease which had been notified during the previous day. In this manner, if enteric fever attacked several persons in the same house, or in neighbouring houses, it was possible at once to critically inspect the property, instead of waiting until perhaps an epidemic of the disease had started. As regards our method of dealing with infectious diseases, so soon as the doctor's notification was received, the Inspector responsible for this particular work entered the case upon his sheet, and then visited the case promptly. Upon a form, designed for the purpose, full particulars were inserted, such as name, age, business, general condition of house, drainage, water supply, source of milk supply, and so on. Then, if for removal, the case was telephoned at once to the Metropolitan Asylums' Board, and generally removal was effected in a few hours, and the place was speedily disinfected, and fit for the re-occupation of the other members of the family. After all, however, I know of nothing which has caused me more trouble, nor over which I have spent more time in thought, than the one burning question of 'over-crowding.' The greatest diversity of opinion appears to have been expressed as to its cure. I take it for granted that in East End Districts at least, the disease exists. I know it. During the year 1900, I myself visited somewhere about 4,000 houses in the District, and from information so gained I can assert that you may accept the statement as true. You cannot prevent over-crowding by turning out of a room an unfortunate family because too many children have been bom into it, for, if dislodged, such a family will occupy a room, at a similar rent as close to' the original spot as possible. "Make them go into a suburb," says another. You will never succeed in this project on any usefully large scale, until you, at the same time, succeed in removing the workshops and the markets which now compel them to live in the over-crowded districts. I feel persuaded that nothing can have any chance of success until it becomes possible to undersell the 'house sweaters' by erecting good, healthy dwellings for the people at rents which should not exceed certainly 3s. per room per week. Who is to carry into effect this suggestion? Not, I take it, the new Borough Councils, with their augmented legal powers. They could not expect to erect buildings at the letting price per room which I have 5 Again, after the present vacant land which is now planned for the erection of houses for the working classes has been so utilised, I am not aware of much more available property within this District. It seems to me that it is a question for consideration by wealthy philanthropists upon the lines which I have suggested. Whatever thought may occur to those in power in dealing with this serious subject, I would urge that before driving a poor family with too many children from its single room, it would be well to consider if that is the best way to stop over-crowding. At present, according to most magistrates' ruling, the person who causes a nuisance must be the first defendant. In the case of a nuisance from overcrowding the defendant is the unfortunate possessor of too large a family. I would suggest for consideration the advisability of placing more responsibility upon the real owner of the property as a means of helping, in more than one way, to overcome the evil. But I must come to an end. I should like to record my thanks to my Medical friends, who have always been so ready to assist me; I believe that there has never been, between them and myself, any but the most cordial feelings of goodwill. I must not omit to do justice to the good and unselfish work of each member of my staff. Each individual has, in his own person, been responsible for his share of the improvement which I have described, and I can only hope that in the future the tendency will be even towards increasing the number of those officers who are primarily concerned in caring for the health of the people who comprise the new Municipality of Stepney. Gentlemen, in conclusion, I desire to state that having worked all my life in Whitechapel, I am still, as ever, most interested in all that concerns its welfare, and I rejoice that I have lived to see it occupying such an improved position among Metropolitan Local Authorities. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOSEPH LOANE. 6 [Copy.] BOARD OF WORKS, WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT. Inspector's Return of Houses speecially visited, 21st day of January, 1890.

The Marriages which took place within the Whitechapel District during the year 1900 numbered 526. Last year they amounted to 505, and in the two previous years they were respectively 512 and 504. The total births which were registered in the three Sub-Registration Districts during the 52 weeks of the year 1900 amounted to 2,902, as compared with 3,005 in 1899, and 3,125 for the year 1898; Whitechapel is thus participating in the general lowering of the birth-rate which has been noticed as existing throughout the Kingdom. In the Whitechapel Infirmary 104 births took place, being 20 fewer than in the previous year. Of this number 22 were the children of women who had not previously resided in the District. Distributing the remaining births between the Sub-Registration Districts to which the mothers belonged, the correct apportionment of births was as follows:— Spitalfields Mile End New Town. Goodman's Fields. Total. 1032 1165 683 2880 so that the number of births as corrected amounted to 2,880, viz.:—1,483 boys and 1,397 girls. See Table A* of the Appendix. The District birth-rate equalled 33.8 per 1,000: that is, if we assume that the population now living within the area comprised in the calculation still remains at 85,000 persons of all ages. As I am writing, great preparations are being made at the Government Offices to take the Census in the coming spring. Probably such Census may apparently confirm my estimate; but from an intimate knowledge of the houses and the people I am confident that more than ordinary care will have to be exercised if every Return proves to be a correct statement of the number of persons who slept in each particular house on a special night. The total deaths which were registered during the year numbered 2,497, viz.:—1,433 males and 1,122 females. Table B† of the Appendix illustrates the deaths which were registered in each Sub-Registration District. For my purpose a deduction has now to be made of those deaths to the number of 1,171, which occurred among nonresidents (mostly in the London Hospital); and then to the remaining sum must be added the deaths of those residents who died in Outlying Public Institutions, or elsewhere outside the District. These deaths numbered 219, against 216 and 203 for the two preceding years. The places where the deaths were registered are tabulated in the Appendix as usual, Table D‡. The corrected number of District deaths for the year 1900 was 1,545, against 1,644 and 1,576 for the two previous years respectively. Males died to the number of 889; 656 females died. A death-rate for the years of 18.0 per 1,000, as against 19.3 in the year 1899, is to be recorded. The excess of births over deaths for the year 1900 was 1,335. Notice this factor in the several years antecedent to the one which originates this Report:—1,335, 1,532, 1,548, and 1,554. The age at death of the residents who died during the year will be seen recorded in Table F‡ of the Appendix. * Page 24. † Page 24. ‡ Page 25. 8 The percentage of death for each age period was as follows: — 26.1 per cent, of the total deaths took place under the age of 1 year. 12.0 ,, ,, ,, between the ages of 1 and 5. 4.4 „ „ „ „ 5 and 20. 13.5 „ „ „ „ 20 and 60. 24.0 ,, ,, ,, ,, 40 and 60. 16.6 ,, ,, ,, ,, 60 and 80. 2.9 ,, „ „ over the age of 80 years. The importance of this Table will be apparent when compared with identical Tables for many preceding years. It is only when contrasted with the same District for a number of years or with a large population like the Metropolis that the true value of these Tables can be appreciated. Compared with, the Metropolitan deaths (including Whitechapel) the infant deaths were as follows : — The deaths of infants under the age of one year, in London, equalled 24.4 per cent. of the total deaths, and 16.0 per cent. of the registered births; in the Whitechapel District those infants who died under the age of one year equalled 26.2 per cent. of the total deaths, and 13.9 per cent. of the registered births. The deaths of children under five years of age, including the above, were, for London' equal to 36.1 per cent. of the total deaths, and 23.7 per cent. of the registered births; and for the Whitechapel District they were equal to 38.2 per cent. of the total deaths, and 20.3 per cent. of the registered births. For comparison purposes I have, as usual, extracted a small table from the Registrar General's Returns. Once again our District occupies the foremost position in the list. The Tower of London deaths are included in those for the Whitechapel District, although for rating purposes it is extra-parochial.

The District of Whitechapel lost only 564, being by far the lowest of the Eastern Districts Limehouse had considerably the hightest record, with 920 deaths, that is to say, on the yearly totals, for each 1,000 births registered in the Whitechapel District there died, under the age of one year, 141 infants, as against 230 in Limehouse. I mention the fact trusting that means may be soon taken to check this large infant mortality. I have again to deplore the absence of maps which accompany a health report. Nothing in the way of Tables or Sheet Lists can illustrate so clearly 9 as well-spotted maps, the distribution throughout a district of cases of, or deaths from, special diseases. I have, for many years, introduced Table I* so that the reader may readily contrast the mortality per cent, from each class of disease, to total deaths for Whitechapel, and also for the entire Metropolis including Whitechapel. Just those diseases which are caused or aggravated by the necessity for living in crowds, and by exposure in all kinds of weather, such as constitutional' diseases, and diseases of the respiratory system, claim more victims from our own people, whereas curiously enough a smaller percentage of deaths from zymotic diseases is recorded than for the whole of London. This has been the experience for some years past. I cannot help thinking that much of this advantage has been due to the special care given by Mr. Shepherd, in every case of infectious disease. Not only are the notifiable diseases looked after in the manner customary in all sanitary areas, but deaths from measles, and deaths from phthisis, are treated in a similar manner. Of course much tact is required to obtain consent in every case, but such consent being refused has not been brought to my knowledge. Only one case of small-pox during the year was credited to Whitechapel. The patient contracted the disease in. a West End District, and during the the incubation period she spent a week end in our District. Practically, therefore, Whitechapel has been clear of small-pox. Two years have now elapsed since the new Vaccination Act came into operation. It was passed as a five years' experiment. So far as one may be able to judge from its working in Whitechapel, it would appear to be successful. That is to say, 315 more cases were vaccinated by the Public Officers during the past year than were vaccinated during the year which preceded the commencement of the new Law. The Glycerinated Calf Lymph supplied from the National Vaccine Establishment of the Local Government Board is free from those organisms which are sources of inflammation and even worse results. However, it cannot be denied that there are many unprotected persons now living in our midst who are a danger to others as well as to themselves. The extracts from the Reports published by the Metropolitan Asylums' Board which I have introduced, sufficiently explain themselves; it will be seen that nearly five millions of persons can only now contribute one case of smallpox. I again assert, on the evidence derived from every epidemic of small-pox, as well as from that produced before the Royal Commission on Vaccination, that vaccination alone is responsible for this condition. In comparison with previous years it will be noticed that many more cases of notifiable infectious diseases have been registered during the past year, but the diseases have been of a comparatively mild type, and the mortality has been very low. In this connection 1 have to offer my thanks to the Officers of the Metropolitan Asylums' Board for the assistance they have given in arranging for the early removal of cases. At a time when a block occurred in the removal of some cases of enteric fever, I wrote to the Clerk of that Board, and immediately he courteously received our cases, much to my relief. The fees paid during the year under the Notification of Infectious Diseases' Clause of the Act, amounted to the sum of £92 14s., as against £75 10s. 6d. for the previous year. Many of the cases were notified by more than one practitioner. In one case four certificates were received for one case of 1 ervsipelas.' This is not the fault of the doctors, who are legally bound to notify every case which comes within their practice, but of the wording of the Act itself. * Page 28. b 10 CASES OF INFECTIOUS SICKNESS, FROM THE RETURNS OF THE METROPOLITAN ASYLUMS' BOARD, THE LONDON FEVER HOSPITAL, AND THE HIGHGATE SMALL-POX HOSPITAL.

PUBLIC MORTUARY STATISTICS. During the eleven months of the year ending November, 207 bodies were received into the Public Mortuary in George Yard. A bag of human bones was deposited; they came from the Whitechapel Road, having been exposed during some building operations. I directed that they should be re-interred at the spot where they had previously been buried, and that a concrete case should surround them. This arrangement subsequently received the approval of the Secretary of State for the Home Department. Of the 207 bodies received into the Public Mortuary, 127 were males, 72 were females, and 8 were ' still-born.' Inquests were held in 198 cases, and 35 post mortem examinations took place. To await interment, 10 bodies were deposited. Shrouds were provided to the number of 43. Of the total admissions 8 were 'still-born.' 84 were infants under the age of 1 year. 16 were between the ages of 1 and 5 years. 9 „ „ 5 and 20 years. 17 ,, ,, 20 and 40 years. 46 ,, ,, 40 and 60 years, 27 were over the age of 60 years. 12 At the end of November, without any communication from the London County Council to myself, I became aware that instructions were given that all inquest cases were to be removed to the Limehouse Mortuary. It must be remembered that the pressing need of local provision for the immediate removal of persons dying in Registered Common Lodging-Houses and other institutions had caused the Whitechapel District Board to build, at a considerable cost, the Mortuary and Coroner's Court, which has for years been of the utmost service in the District, and now by the action of the London County Council it is probable that soon some of the scandals of former days may be repeated. So that no delay should take place in the removal of the dead from the common kitchen of a Lodging-House or elsewhere, the Police possessed a key of the Mortuary, so that it was available at any hour. Should such an emergency now arise, say at 10 or 11 o'clock at night, the body must remain unmoved until business hours in the morning. I was thus informed by the Coroner's Officer soon after the New Order had been issued. I feel bound, in the interest of public decency, to protest against this arrangement. Another great objection to the removal of bodies to such a distance, is the fact that medical men must make a long journey to Limehouse to attend inquests, whereas formerly they were at no such disadvantage owing to the central position of the Mortuary and Coroner's Court. Just a word or two about Bubonic Plague. The Local Government Board and the London County Council had arranged a complete system for coping with the disease had it appeared in our midst, and the Metropolitan Asylums' Board were prepared with suitable accommodation for patients. Our own provision consisted in the appointment of two doctors to whom suspicious cases might be referred for daily supervision. As a fact only two cases were reported upon at a cost to the District of two guineas.

A careful examination of the Water Reports emanating from the Government Offices, as well as from the Water Companies themselves, prove that the water supplied was of excellent quality both from a chemical and from a bacteriological standpoint. You will notice that among the samples which were submitted to the Analyst were some purchases of beer. Both light and dark were examined; all were found free from adulteration, and no arsenic was present. As a Royal Commission has been appointed to investigate the whole question of the presence of arsenic in certain manufactures of glucose which were used for the purpose of sweetening beer, it would be unseemly for me to discuss the question. Beer is the national beverage, and it is most important that nothing deletereous should be added to it in the process of manufacture. In conclusion, I append a List of the Expenses incurred in working the Sanitary Department fo»r the whole year : — £ s. d. Housekeeper's petty cash for window cleaning of house, and costs of proceedings at Police Court, etc. 31 4 0 Repairs to Disinfecting Machine,—Coals and materials for cleansing various departments 47 15 5 Registrars, for weekly returns 29 14 4 Printing, Stationery, Office Registers, etc. 98 9 5 Covers for furniture, shrouds, gas and coals at Mortuary 23 11 6 Disinfecting Machine: Overalls for men, repairs, rubbers, bags 17 19 9 Disinfectants, gummed paper, drain tests 56 19 7 £305 14 0 The yearly average for the past four years was ,£284 8s. 5d. I ask attention to the small amount spent upon the item 'disinfectants,' chiefly Kemp's Drain Tests. I could never agree to the policy of pouring large quantities of so-called disinfectants into the sewers, it is merely wasted. Where it is possible to do so, hand labour should bring the germicide into contact with the surface to be cleansed, or efficient flushing with large quantities of water should be resorted to. The use of sulphurous acid gas, after the removal of a case of infectious disease, may have a good moral effect upon the relatives and friends of patients, but, personally, I have preferred to pely upon a solution of perchloride of mercury applied to the walls and ceilings of rooms by means of large flat brushes. I believe that by this plan disease has frequently been stopped from spreading, and this good result has been achieved at comparatively little cost. I regret to record the death of George Harvey, from enteric fever. The disease was presumably contracted within the District, and in the course of his ordinary duty. Careful, painstaking, competent and willing, it will be most difficult to fill the gap caused by his death. Of the other members of the Staff who were placed under my supervision, I have nothing but praise to record. However carefully I might devise plans for the improvement of the District, the real work was carried out by them, and to them must be given the credit for the results which I have had the honour and pleasure to register. I heartily wish them God speed in their work in the future. SPECIAL RETURNS Ordered to be prepared by the Local Government Board.

The total number of Samples of Food submitted to the Public Analyst for Analysis during the year 1900 was 141, viz.:—Milk, 64; Bread, 12; Butter, 19; Cheese, 13; Margarine, 12; Condensed Milk, 1; Oatmeal, 5; Lard, 2; Sugar, 2; Sago, 2; Ground Rice, 3; Ale, 3; and Porter, 3. Of the milks, 10 were of poor quality; 2 were adulterated with 6 and 7 per cent, of water respectively, the vendors of which were cautioned; 1 was adulterated with 18 per cent, of water, the vendor of which was summoned and fined £5, and 12/6 costs or one month's imprisonment, the fine and costs were paid to the Board; I was adulterated with. 6 per cent. of water and deficient in cream to the extent of 30 per cent, in this case proceedings could not be taken for the reason that the bottle containing the third portion retained for production at the Court as required by Sec. 21 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, burst, and the milk was consequently lost. The condensed milk was condensed machine (or separated) milk; the vendor was cautioned for not having a label on the tin as required by the Act. Of the butters, 1 contained a slightly excessive proportion of water; and 1 contained 8 per cent. of water. The remainder of the Articles were genuine and unadulterated. The ales and porters were supplied by separate and distinct Brewers, and were free from arsenic. During the year copies of the following Notice have been freely distributed to tradesmen in the District dealing in articles of food, with very good results. RICHARD SKIDMORE WRACK, Inspector appointed under the said Acts. 36 BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT. THE SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS, 1875 and 1899 38 and 39 Vict., Ch. 63, and 62 and 63 Vict. Ch. 51. NOTICE. Attention is hereby directed to some of the Provisions of the above Acts for making better provision for the Sale of Food and Drugs in a pure state. A.D. 1875. Secftion 6. No person shall sell to the prejudice of the purchaser any article of food or any drug which is not of the nature, substance, and quality of the article demanded by such purchaser, under a penalty not exceeding twenty pounds. Section 9. No person shall, with the intent that the same may be sold in its altered state without notice, abstract from an article of food any part of it so as to affect injuriously its quality, substance, or nature, and no person shall sell any article so altered without making disclosure of the adulteration, under a penalty in each case not exceeding twenty pounds. Any person who shall forge, or shall utter, knowing it to be forged for the purposes of this Act, any certificate or any writing purporting to contain a warranty, shall be guilty of a misdemeanour and be punishable on conviction by imprisonment for a term of not exceeding two years with hard labour; Every person who shall wilfully apply to an article of food, or a drug, in any proceedings under this Act, a certificate or warranty given in relation to any other article or drug, shall be guilty of an offence under this Act, and be liable to a penalty not exceeding twenty pounds; Every person who shall give a false warranty in writing to any purchaser in respect of an article of food or a drug sold by him as principal or agent, shall be guilty of an offence under this Act, and be liable to a penalty not exceeding twenty pounds; And every person who shall wilfully give a label with any article sold by him which shall falsely desciibe the article sold, shall be guilty of an offence under this Act, and be liable to a penalty not exceeding twenty pounds. A.D. 1889. Sedtion 5. The provisions of the Margarine Act, 1887, as amended by this Act, shall extend to margarine-cheese, and shall apply accordingly, with the substitution of "margarinecheese" and "cheese" for "margarine" and "butter," and provided that all margarine-cheese sold or dealt in otherwise than by retail shall either be inclosed in packages marked in accordance with the Margarine Act, 1887, as amended by this Act, or be itself conspicuously branded with the words " margarine-cheese." Section 6. (1) Where under this Act or the Margarine Act, 1887, it is required that any package containing margarine or margarine-cheese shall be branded or marked, the brand or mark shall be on the package itself and not solely on a label, ticket, or other thing attached thereto.

Section 11 Every tin or other receptacle containing condensed, separated or skimmed milk must bear a label clearly visible to the purchaser on which the words "machine-skimmed milk," or "skimmed milk," as the case may require, are printed in large legible type, and if any person sells or exposes or offers for sale condensed, separated or skimmed milk in contravention of this section he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding ten pounds. Sestion 17. (1) Where, under any provision of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, a person guilty of an offence is liable to a fine which may extend to twenty pounds as a maximum, he shall be liable for a second offence under the same provision to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds, and for any subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds. (2) Where, under any provision of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, a person guilty of an offence is liable to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds, and the offence, in the opinion of the court, was committed by the personal act, default, or culpable negligence of the person accused, that person shall be liable (if the court is of opinion that a fine will not meet the circumstances of the case) to imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for a period not exceeding three months. Proceedings will be taken against any person committing an offence against the provisions of the said acts for the recovery of the penalties imposed thereby.

To Dr. Joseph Loane, Medical Officer of Health, Sir, According to our usual custom we hand you herewith a Tabulated Statement setting out the work carried out by us during the past year. It will be seen that a large amount of work has again been accomplished. The space required, were we to do so, alone prevents us giving details of the work. House to house inspection has been, as systematically as possible, carried out during the year. Great care and attention was paid to the question of unwholesome food. At the foot of the Statement above referred to will be found particulars of the articles seized and destroyed. Fifteen summonses were issued under the Public Health (London) Act during the year, a decrease of 12 as compared with last year. The fines and costs recovered amounted in all to £25 18s. A detailed statement of these summonses we also hand you. Last year we reported that 708 cases of infectious diseases had occurred. We have this year to report an increase of 162 cases, making a total of 870. Disinfection was promptly carried out in every instance. As this is the last time we shall have the privilege of handing you particulars of our year's work, we take this opportunity of thanking you for your many kindnesses to us in the past, and also to thank you for your appreciation of our endeavours to improve the sanitary condition of the Whitechapel District. We regret very much the loss this Department has sustained lately by (he death of one of our number, Mr. George Harvey. We are, Sir, Your obedient Servants, RICHARD SKI DM ORE WRACK, THOS. P.
