The amount of the Guardians' Calls for the year ending Lady-day, 1880, was £39,000; and for the last year, £43,500; and for the half-year, Lady-day to Michaelmas, 1881, is £27,000. The amount owing to the Guardians at Lady-day, 1881, was £4,750.

The statement hereto appended will give the details of the receipts and expenditure on account of the Sewers and General Rates. It is only necessary here to state that the rates levied for the last three years were— 1870 1880 1881 General—in the £ 2/- 2/1 2/1 Sewers ditto 6d. 7d. 7d. 2/6 2/8 2/8 The total amount collected on the Vestry Rates for the year Was £66,370 3s. 2d., an increase from the previous year of £951 18s. 4d. Of these sums collected by the Vestry as for Poor rates, large amounts are paid to other authorities for purposes over which the Vestry has no control. Thus, in addition to the £43,500 paid to the Guardians, out of which the County Rates and Metropolitan Asylum Board's charges are paid, there is a sum of £10,591 11s. 2d. paid to the Commissioners of Metropolitan Police, and £440 9s. 5d. for Registration, &c., expenses. From the Sewers rate is paid the Metropolitan Board's Consolidated rate of £11, 994 9s. 5d. From the General rate is paid the School Board rate of £13,550 5s. 10d., and the Toll Bridges Precept of £1,814 3s. 7d. All these charges are based upon the rateable value of the property according to the valuation list, and no reduction is made for empty houses, or for the allowance to owners. The payments made to the several public authorities during he past two years were as follows:— 1880 1881 Metropolitan Board £12323 8 6 £13808 17 4 Commissioners of Police 10641 15 0 10591 11 2 School Board 11538 6 2 13550 5 10 Guardians of the Parish 30000 0 0 43500 0 0 7 RE-VALUATION. The quinquennial re-valuation of the Parish took place during the year, and resulted in an increase of value as follows:— List in force—April, 1880; April, 1881. Increase. Gross rental £650,990 £721,167 £70,177 Rateable value 526,035 580,411 54,376 But of this increase nearly £20,000 was in respect of the properties of Public Companies—Railway, Gas, and Water. Appeals were entered at the Assessment Sessions by the North London Railway Company, and by the Telegraph Construction Company, but the differences were arranged before hearing. RAILWAYS, TRAMWAYS, &c. No application has been made to Parliament during the present Session for any powers in relation to Railways, &c., which in any way affect this parish. LOCAL IMPROVEMENTS. No local improvements have been made in the parish during this year, nor have any been projected. The financial arrangements arising out of the Harwar Street Improvement have not been finally adjusted, but it will be in a fair way of settlement as soon as the total cost has been ascertained. The share which the Parish will have to contribute, independently of the cost of paving, &c., will be about £500, or rather less. The particulars of the arrangement made with the Drapers' Company in respect to Charity known as Harwar's, in relation to this improvement, were fully explained in last year's report. 8 DRINKING FOUNTAIN, GREAT EASTERN STREET AND OLD STREET. This handsome structure was completed and opened in February last. The total cost was £1070 11s. 1d., and was paid from the fund contributed by the Tramway Company for the use of the paving belonging to the Vestry. THE TOWN HALL. During the year the Large Hall has been let 145 times; the Council Chamber 24 times; the Committee Rooms have been used by Local Societies, mostly free of charge. The receipts for letting were £1,214 8s. 8d. VESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS.

There are about fifty-one miles of roads in the parish, of which twelve are paved, the remainder being McAdam and Ballast. 37 FOOTWAY PAVING.

Three masons and three laborers were employed in the repair of footways and trenches, and their wages amounted to £406 15s. l0d. for the year, and the sum of £199 17s. 7d. was contributed by the Companies for repairs of trenches. 38 The following quantities of old stone in the Vestry stone yards, were dressed during the year, at a cost of £127 8s. l1d., viz:— 123½ yards super York edging 591 „ „ Granites 262 feet „ Moor stone 1176 „ run Curb 234 ,, „ Tram 4 Quadrant Blocks. SEWERS WORK. The following are the only works that were executed during the year. Edmunds Place, Shepherdess Walk—120 feet run of 12-inch pipe, at a cost of £35 19s. Od. Laburnum Street—520 feet run of 3-ft. 9-in. x 2-ft. 6-in. brick sewer, at a cost of £665 l1s. 5d., including the sum of £30 18s. 4d. paid to a clerk of works. Four flushers and several laborers were employed in the cleansing and repairing the sewers and gullies in the Parish, and the amount paid in wages to them for the year was £553 19s. 4d. One man has been constantly employed in cleansing the Urinals in the Parish, and on Sundays and holidays two men are employed in the early morning for the same purpose, the amount paid in wages for the year was £64 4s. 5d. The urinals were painted during the year, at a total cost of £36 16s.'4d. The sum of £17 16s. 8d. was expended in wages for labor in removing and setting up lamp columns, under the direction of the Lamp Inspector. 39 The sum of £40 15s. 6d. was paid the Inspector for supervision of the Water Carts during the watering season. The sum of £128 16s. 9d. was expended for extra labor in clearing away snow from the channels and centre of roads, during the nine days, from 20th to 29th January, 1881. As regards the general condition of the Parish, I may state that as a very little has been expended in carriageway paving during the year, the paved carriageways are not (with the exception of new work) in very satisfactory order. The following certainly require to be repaved at once in order to prevent accidents— Clifton Street Pitfield Street Bevenden Street Commercial Street and Shoreditch, from Commercial Street to Great Eastern Street. The unpaved roadways, in consequence of the use of the steam roller, are getting in a very fair state. In consequence of the very small amount expended in footway paving, a great many of the footways are in a very bad condition, and certainly require early attention. Reports and estimates for new work, in addition to those already submitted, will be laid before the Vestry in due course. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, GEORGE CHARLES PERRETT, Surveyor. Town Hall, Old Street, June, 1881. 41 SAINT LEONARD, SHOREDITCH. To the Lighting Committee of the Vestry of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch. April, 1881. Gentlemen, I beg to submit the following tables, shewing the operation of the average meter system during the third year. The total cost of gas, lighting and extinguishing, cleaning, repairs, painting and maintenance for the year is £5331 10s. 1d., or £3 16s. 1d. per lamp. The total number of lamps now in use is 1405, 13 of which are paid for by railways and theatres, 7 additional lamps have been fixed and put in lighting during the year, 4 discontinued and 26 removed from one position to another more favorable. The testing apparatus, supplied for testing the governors and burners, is in working order, and avoids the necessity of sending them away to be done, except those requiring to be repaired. 326 opal tablets, with the names of streets in black letters burnt in, have been affixed to lamps at the corners of streets, which facilitates strangers finding the streets they require, especially after dark.

FOR THE YEAR ENDING 25th MARCH, 1881. To the Vestry of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch. Gentlemen, 5,127 births—2,633 males and 2,494 females,—and 2,864 deaths were registered in the twelve months ending 25th March, 1881. Deducting the deaths (277) which occured in Holborn Infirmary, the mortality was 20.80 per 1,000 living, below the average of the last five years, which was 22.41 per 1,000. The largest number of deaths was registered in Haggerstone West District (Haggerston East being now included) in which is situated Shoreditch Infirmary. Population. Deaths. Average per 100 Hoxton New Town 27,835 753 27.0 Hoxton Old Town 26,933 517 19.37 Haggerstone West 43,421 1,102 25.20 St. Leonards 16,545 328 19.80 Holywell 12,430 164 13.17 48 663 deaths occurred in public institutions of the parish; 343 in Shoreditch Infirmary; 277 in Holborn Infirmary, situate in Hoxton New Town; 27 in the North Eastern Hospital; and 16 in Hoxton House. Diseases acknowledged to be caused by cold and damp were very destructive. There were 359 deaths from bronchitis, 293 from phthisis, and 182 from pneumonia. All lung affections are much influenced by cold and wet. The number of deaths under one year has slightly increased, being 944 as against 919 the year before; and under five years of age has decreased, being 1,358 against 1,432 in the previous year. 458 deaths occurred in persons at and over 65 years of age; 163 persons died from 75 to 85; 45 from 85 to 95; and 7 deaths were registered at 95 and upwards; whilst in the previous year the weather then also being very cold and damp, 291 died at 65 to 75 ; 192 from 75 to 85; 46 from 85 to 95; and 6 from 95 and upwards. In infancy, the largest number of deaths was caused by lung disease (242), comprising 94 from bronchitis, 54 from pneumonia, and 94 from other pulmonary affections. The diseases which came next in order of fatality were atrophy and debility, 104 deaths; convulsions, 94; whooping cough, 54; premature birth, 75; and diarrhoea, 149. In old age, 237 deaths were caused by bronchitis, 53 by heart disease, and 51 by paralysis; but the largest number, 242, was registered under the term of “old age.” During the Winter and Spring months (December, January, February and March) of the year ending 25th March, 1881, there were 1,013 deaths registered, whilst in the corresponding months of the previous year, there were 1,275 deaths. ZYMOTIC DISEASES caused 426 deaths—54 by whooping 49 cough, 201 by diarrhoea, 47 by scarlet fever, 25 by measles, 6 by diptheria, and 93 by other zymotic diseases. 23 of the 54 deaths from whooping cough occurred to infants under one year of age; 149 of the 201 deaths from diarrhoea occurred under one year. The influence of age is much more manifest; 49 of the 54 deaths from whooping cough were in infants under two years; and 178 of the 201 deaths from diarrhoea occurred under two years of age. There were 25 deaths from small pox. DWELLINGS have received much attention, a large number have been much improved, repaired, cleansed, better ventilated, made drier, and more suitable appliances provided for health. Owners recognize more clearly than in the past that it is their interest to keep the dwellings in a better condition. Dirt is the great destroyer—the great puller down. Cleanliness means Godliness, and health means reliability, economy, and durability. It is more patent to the mind—year by year—that water and air are the great exposers of bad work; which, acted on by heat and cold, soon reveals if money has been well spent, and if the workmen were trustworthy. To secure the needful condition for healthy progress, the Sanitary Authority of the Parish continuously endeavour to bring about improvements in the dwellings. Inspector Alexander's report shews the nature of the changes. Improved drains have been laid in 557 premises. Drains trapped in 332 premises. Stack pipes, allowing sewer gases to escape into dwellings, disconnected from drains, in 403 premises. Waste pipes of sinks disconnected from drains, and termination in open air, over yard sinks, in 187 premises. Water laid on to closets in 541 premises. Closets cleansed and repaired in 535 premises. 50 Yards paved imperviously with stone or concrete in 535 premises. Water supplied direct from the main, in lieu of cisterns, in 280 premises. Walls and ceilings cleansed and repaired in 210 dwellings ; and roofs repaired in 82. 4,799 separate conditions, dangerous to health, were removed and 801 dwellings were made more suitable for health. CONSTANT WATER SUPPLY has, on the whole, continued to work well, and it supplies the inhabitants with fresh and clean water instead of the stagnant, unclean water of butts and cisterns. Inhabitants have complained that they have suffered much inconvenience arising from the water being turned off at the mains when it is wanted during the night. Ages of experience—deaths in numbers beyond calculation— has shewn, that collected decomposing organic matters are the promoters of epidemic and other diseases in mind and body; and when, as in large cities, such matters are unavoidably collected, the overflow of air and water, the sun's power and light are the great preventatives and disinfectants. 395 cases of contagious disease were reported to the Sanitary Department, 223 of which were cases of small pox. Much of Inspector Fletcher's time has been occupied in securing the isolation of the infected sick, and for that purpose 137 persons were removed to the Small Pox Hospital, 61 could not be removed, and 25 died; also in the disinfection of the infected houses. In the early part of last autumn the Metropolitan Asylums Board expressed apprehension that they would not be able to 51 provide sufficient hospital accommodation for the small pox cases, and suggested that the Vestry should provide additionally for its own Parish. That suggestion your Medical Officer could not support until it was made clear that the Metropolitan Asylums Board were unable to meet the public want. Later on, when the epidemic had assumed larger proportions, the Board increased the hospital accommodation, and received all cases from Shoreditch; but as the epidemic still continued to increase, it was apprehended that the Asylum's means for isolation might be inadequate, therefore the Vestry arranged to have twelve beds in the hospital erected at West Ham, by the Poplar Sanitary Authority. Fortunately these beds have not been required, as the epidemic has much diminished. They may, however, be of service in the coming winter. The Disinfecting Apparatus has continued to work well. 2,723 articles were disinfected in it during the year, including 402 infected beds. 391 houses, in which there had been contagious disease, were disinfected by sulphur fumigation, cleansing, and the rooms freely exposed to the open air. REMOVAL OF DUST, AND CLEANSING OF STREETS.— Inspector Fletcher's report shews that the Contractors have done their work according to their engagements, except in the month of March, when the removal of dust was much impeded. That too much dust is accumulated on premises cannot be denied, and the system of removal is open to improvement. The streets, during the past three years, have been better attended to. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H. G. SUTTON, Medical Officer of Health. 53 INSPECTOR ALEXANDER'S REPORT, St. Leonard, Shoreditch, Sanitary Department. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to present the following report on the Sanitary work done under my superintendance during the year ending 25th March, 1881, shewing the number of premises inspected, the nature of nuisances under notice, and the orders made for their abatement. A special report on the houses in St. John's terrace, Hackney road was made by order of the Sanitary Committee, setting forth in detail the injurious conditions existing in 40 premises. Special reports were also presented on the condition and Sanitary appliances of the North Eastern Hospital, Hackney road, and Kingsland road Police Station. House to house visitation, and special inspection with reference to complaints made in 955 premises. Notices served requiring the abatement of nuisances injurious to health in 861 premises. 54 WORKS DONE TO SECURE ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES.

Defectively constructed pipe drains repaired or relaid in 217 „ Drains provided where there were none before in 3 „ Drains (untrapped), traps provided in 332 „ Cesspools emptied and filled up in 19 „ Stack pipes (having their heads dangerously close to bedroom windows, permitting sewer gas to pass into the dwellings) disconnected from drains in 403 „ Stack pipes provided in 20 ,, Eaves gutters provided in 25 „ Waste pipes, of sinks within doors (untrapped and permitting sewer gas to impregnate the dwellings) have been securely trapped,, or otherwise disconnected from drains, and have now their ends in the open air, and immediately over the yard sinks in 187 „ Roofs repaired in 82 ,, Stairs repaired in 19 „ Walls and ceilings cleansed, whitened and repaired throughout in 120 „ Ditto ditto in part in 90 „ Sashes repaired in 11 „ Ventilation provided under ground floor in 19 „ Water closets (foul and dilapidated) cleansed and repaired in 535 ,, Water closets cleansed and whitened in 118 ,, Water restored or newly laid on to water closets in 541 ,, Obstructions in water closets removed in 52 „ Water closets in close dark situations removed into light and air in 38 „ 55 Water closets in close dark places lighted and ventilated in 10 premises Water supplied direct from the main, in lieu of cisterns in 280 „ Water supplied direct from the main, in lieu of butts in 38 „ Leaking water pipes, causing dampness, repaired in 51 „ Yards and areas limewashed. in 128 „ Dust bins provided in 229 „ „ repaired in 25 „ Yards paved imperviously with stone or cement concrete in 535 „ Yard paving repaired, and rendered impervious in 38 „ Areas paved imperviously with stone or cement concrete in 51 ,, Sculleries ditto ditto in 99 „ Dry areas constructed to obviate dampness in 7 ,, Premises unfit for habitation, closed in 19 „ Ten public dust bins of improved construction have been provided, which relieves 96 of the above premises from nuisances arising from accumulations of refuse in small back yards. MISCELLANEOUS. Overcrowding abated in 4. premises. Water restored in 6 „ Additional Water Closets provided in 2 „ Urinal provided in 1 „ Dung receptacle provided in 1 „ Horse improperly stabled removed from 1 ,, Accumulation of dung and rubbish removed from 46 „ Well closed in 1 ., Making a total of 4,799 separate nuisances, dangerous to health abated, in 861 dwellings. 50 To ensure the work done being, us far as possible, of a durable character, many re-inspections had to be made, and 264 letters wore written, which took up much time, resulting, however, in the owners having their work generally well done. A few instances are again mentioned in detail, to show the manner of procedure, and the nature of the work accomplished. HENRY'S PLACE, HOXTON STREET, 14 houses.—These houses were very dirty and dilapidated. The main drain in the narrow courtway was a large dilapidated brick barrel. The branch drains were also in a very defective state; in consequence of which the houses were infested with rats, and largely inpregnated with sewer gas. In the small yards (which were very defectively paved and drained) were sheds, within which were brick cisterns, built on the ground. The accumulations of house refuse in those small yards were also great nuisances. The water closets were foul and without water supply. Notices wero served on the owner, in compliance with which, the main drain and all its defective branches have been removed, and glazed stoneware pipes properly laid in lieu thereof. The sheds that largely filled the small yards (obstructing light and air) have been removed. The brick cisterns, and the foul dilapidated dustbins have also been removed, and their purpose met by the provision of a constant supply of water drawn direct from the main, and by the provision of one public dust bin, of improved construction. The yards have been solidly paved. The water closets have water laid on. The floors paved with cement concrete; and the interiors of the houses generally cleansed aud repaired. 57 NORTH EASTERN HOSPITAL.— Fever having occurred amongst the nurses, led to an inspection, at the request of the Secretary, when it was found—That the waste, or overflow pipe of the cistern, supplying the drinking water, was connected directly into the drain. The lower end of the pipe being in the drain and the upper end level with the surface of the water. Sewer gas must of necessity have polluted the water; added to which the kitchen sink was untrapped and emitting sewer gas. The water closet arrangements were also defective throughout. A copy of the special report on these conditions, and notice requiring the abatement of the nuisances were forwarded to the Governors of the Hospital, who promptly rectified the evils complained of. GOPSALL MEWS.—The only water for the use of a large number of persons employed on the premises was that obtained from a well at the lower end of the inclined roadway of the mews; as there was good reason to believe the water was impregnated poisonously a sample was forwarded to the analyst, whose report showed the water to be quite unfit for drinking purposes, it being largely polluted with animal matters. Notice was served on the owner, requiring the well to be filled up, and a proper supply of water to be laid on to the premises. This order was modified by consent of the committee. The pump to be locked and labelled "unfit for drinking," and a proper supply of drinking water to be provided, which has been done. HUNTINGDON STREET, ESSEX STREET and LITTLE ESSEX STREET.—Nearly all the houses in these streets were supplied with water which was stored in cisterns placed under the floors of small back rooms on the parlor level. These rooms were used some as workshops, some as bed rooms and others as day rooms for families. There was no protection for the water, beyond that 58 of the floor boards, left loose to give freedom of access, and verymany of the cisterns on inspection were found extremely dirty, so much so, that in some cases the surface of the water was thick with cobwebs and dirt, and various dirty matters were found at the bottom of the cisterns. These conditions being reported to the Vestry, an order was made, requiring the owners to provide a supply of water direct from the main, without the intervention of cisternage. This, after much trouble and delay (it being necessary to summon one owner) has been accomplished in every one of the houses throughout the three streets. HOUSES UNFIT FOR HABITATION.—The twelve four-roomed houses, No. 2 to 24, Scrutton street have frequently been brought under the consideration of the Sanitary Committee, and notices were served some years ago, by order of the Vestry, prohibiting the use of the lower rooms, they being quite unfit for people to live in, by reason of being underground, dark and very damp. The property having passed into the hands of a new owner these lower rooms were again let, and notices were again served prohibiting their use, and requiring the other parts of the premises to be made fit for habitation. The owner thereon decided to close all the houses (which has been done) with a view to re-construction. 1 & 2, COACII YARD.—These two-roomed houses were so foul and dilapidated as to be quite unfit for human habitation. They were closed in compliance with the Vestry's order, and they have since been pulled down, and superior property is being erected on the site. 1 & 2, AXE COURT, HACKNEY ROAD.—These two-roomed houses were also very dirty and dilapidated. In this case the owner likewise decided to close the premises (which has been done) with a view to re-construction. 59 32, 33 & 34, WILSON STREET, and No. 25 to 39, WHITE HORSE COURT.—A property which has given a great deal of trouble from its unsatisfactory condition. Temporary work was sanctioned by the committee, on the application of the owner, and on his promise that the whole of the houses would be demolished, and the site covered with model dwellings. The site is now being rapidly cleared for that purpose. Police Court Summonses were taken out against the owners of five houses in Huntingdon street, one house in Little Essex street, and one house in Shepherdess walk, to obtain orders for the abatement of nuisances. The magistrates made the order applied for on behalf of the Vestry in each case. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. ALEXANDER, Sanitary Inspector. 61 INSPECTOR FLETCHER'S REPORT. ST. LEONARD, SHOREDITCH, Sanitary Department. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to report to you, that during the year, ending March 25th, 1881, the conditions named below have caused nuisances dangerous to health, and were inspected and remedied under my supervision. Accumulations of dung &c., removed from 12 premises. Obstructed closet drains repaired and cleansed in 2 „ Water closets cleansed and repaired in 1 „ Water laid on or reinstated in 42 „ Yard Paving relaid in 5 „ Overcrowding abated in 5 „ Dirty rooms cleansed in 1 „ Smoke nuisances abated in 2 „ Pigs removed from 1 ,, Corpses, decomposing, removed from 4 „ Minor nuisances (not referred to Inspector Alexander) little alteration needed in 9 „ NUISANCES DANGEROUS TO HEALTH CONSEQUENT ON INFECTIOUS DISEASES—The following details shew the Sanitary measures adopted where cases of contagious disease occurred. 62 No. of houses inspected and disinfected 391 Notices served requiring occupiers to disinfect articles liable to retain infection in 391 premises. 395 cases of contagious diseases were reported to the Sanitarydepartment, of which 223 were cases of small pox. Much care was taken to prevent the spread of this disease, by isolating the sick and disinfecting the houses, drains, &c. 137 of the above small pox cases were removed to the small pox hospital, 61 were not removed, and 25 died. No. of infected beds disinfected at the Vestry's disinfecting oven 402 Ditto pillows ditto 369 Ditto mattrasses ditto 68 Ditto bolsters ditto 160 Ditto other articles ditto 1121 Making a total of 2723 articles disinfected. ARTICLES OP FOOD &c., condemned and destroyed by me as being unfit for human consumption. 46 tins of potted lobsters 7 bags of chestnuts 3 trunks of plaice 2 boxes of kippers. SALE OF POOD AND DRUGS ACT.—See Analyst's Report. REMOVAL OP DUST.—During the year ending 25th March, 1881, the dust on the whole has been fairly removed from the Parish, and there has been about the same number of applications for the removal of dust from private dwellings, except during the month of March, when an increase took place, but the numbers were soon reduced. The number of applications during the past year, compared with the number of applications during the previous three years is shewn below:— 63 Eastern Division. Western Division. 1st 2nd 3rd 1st 2nd 3rd 1880-1 1478 13 0 1540 10 0 In the previous three years the average number was— 1136 5 0 1613 12 0 The plan of exposing the letter D in the front window, when an inhabitant requires the dust removed, has answered fairly. SCAVENGING.— The system adopted by the Vestry three years since, of accepting the proposals of two Contractors, viz., one for the Eastern and one for the Western Division, has been found to work satisfactorily, and is the means of getting- the work done in an efficient manner. On the 18th January, 1881, we had an exceedingly heavy fall of snow; every facility was given by the Vestry and their Officers to the Contractors in removing it, who, I am pleased to say, answered to the call satisfactorily. Many thousands of loads were removed to convenient shoots, and despite the long and severe winter, the complaints were very few. WATERING THE ROADS.— The system of hiring vans, carts, horses, men, &c., to water the roads and streets, under the immediate supervision of the Vestry's Officers, on the whole has worked satisfactorily; although several complaints were made during the first two months respecting the watering, owing principally to the Contractor living some distance out of the parish, and the men not knowing the sections (although printed for them), but during the last quarter of the contract the work has been carried out very fairly. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. R. FLETCHER, Sanitary Inspector. 64 APPENDIX A. SITUATION OF THE URINALS IN THE PARISH. 1. King Johns Court, Holywell Lane (Brick and Slate) 2.
