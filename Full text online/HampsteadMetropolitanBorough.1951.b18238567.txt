LIBRARY HAMP 52 Metropolitan Borough of Hampstead Abridged Report on the Health of the Borough. DENNIS H. GEFFEN, m.d., b.s., M.R.c.s., l.R.c.P., d.p.h., Medical Officer of Health. 2 Public Health Department, 33, Lancaster Grove, Hampstead, N.W.3. 25th June, 1952. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Hampstead. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in submitting to you the Annual Report on the health of the residents of Hampstead for the year 1951. During this year, according to the Registrar General's estimate, the population had risen to 97,750, i.e., 350 more than the previous year. On the other hand the population as indicated by the preliminary figures resulting from the Census which took place in 1951 is 95,073. The Infantile Mortality Rate for the year was 27 per 1,000 births. Although this figure is lower than that for the country as a whole, it is slightly above the figure for London itself, and compares unfavourably with the figure of 19 last year. The total number of births was 1,414 and in fact 38 children died before they reached the age of 1 year. In 12 cases the underlying cause of death was prematurity, 7 babies died of broncho pneumonia and in another 4 cases a congenital defect caused the death. It will be obvious that individual factors affect the mortality rate very considerably when it is based on such small numbers. In November the Council was informed of the death of Dr. Cox who had been Hampstead's Public Analyst for over 25 years. Dr. Cox had achieved the highest reputation and the Council, in paying tribute to the services he had rendered to the Borough, regretted the loss of so distinguished a member of the staff. Mr. E. Voelcker has been appointed to fill the post temporarily. 1,782 notifications of infectious disease were received during the year and in 188 cases the patient was removed to hospital. These notifications include 74 of pneumonia and of these 4 patients died. One child died of whooping cough and one of measles. There was a mild epidemic of measles during the year, the notifications being 1,187 as compared with 588 in 1950. Only 2 cases of poliomyelitis were notified and in both of these paralysis was one of the symptoms. Scarlet fever accounted for 70 notifications and 21 of these cases were removed to hospital. The disease showed no tendency to assume the severity associated with it in previous years. At the end of the year the register of tuberculosis contained 875 names. At the time of writing this report an investigation is being made, following upon a visit or information otherwise obtained, concerning every notified case. It has already become apparent that many of the names on the register were of persons who have left the district and I hope very shortly to be able to give a truer picture of the situation as it exists in the Borough. Tuberculosis still remains the major endemic disease of importance in this country, causing prolonged illness and 3 distress to a heavy proportion of the population. Close co-operation exists between the Chest Physician and your Public Health Department and I am in regular contact with Dr. Shneerson. Every case is visited by members of his Department to deal with the social and medical aspect of the case, and by members of my Department to deal so far as this may INFANTILE MORTALITY SINCE 1900. be possible, with the environmental conditions. Newer methods of treatment, both surgical and medical, will undoubtedly help to arrest or cure the disease, particularly so when cases are diagnosed in an early stage. It must be remembered however, that tuberculosis is an infectious disease and must be treated as such. If it were possible to apply to the tuberculous person the same methods of isolation as one can to other infectious diseases of shorter duration, it is probable that the (6003) a 2 4 problem as a national one could be considerably ameliorated. The duration of the disease and the lack of housing accommodation make this difficult. On the other hand there is much that the tuberculous patient can do to prevent spreading the disease himself, provided he understands the nature of the disease and the methods by which it may be contracted. The work of the Chest Clinic and the Public Health Department is directed towards these objects. To achieve earlier diagnosis Mass X-ray of as large a percentage of the population as possible is attempted. It will be seen that 2,061 persons attended for X-ray during the year. Of these, 7 were found to require further medical advice and one was advised to attend for a further examination. I would once again refer to the needs of the aged and infirm persons in the Borough. Week by week our attention is called to the problem of some aged person who needs help either to continue to live in his own home, or on account of increasing age or illness, needs admission to hospital. In every case a visit is paid by the appropriate members of your Department and we have been able to bring considerable help and comfort to many. I would like to acknowledge the excellent help I have received from the Home Help Service of the London County Council and the various voluntary associations in the Borough who are concerned with the care of the aged. I have visited the various Darby and Joan Clubs in Hampstead and I would stress how valuable they are in bringing interest and in relieving the loneliness of the older residents of the Eorough. They are in many cases the major social contact and recreation of those they serve. It is through the Home Help Service, the District Nurse, the British Red Cross Meals Service, the Darby and Joan Clubs and other similar associations that it is possible to keep the aged in the surroundings of their choice and make it possible for them to live a life of comfort and interest and to obviate entirely, or for many years, the need for removal to an institution. I am of the opinion that this should be our object, for it is the usual desire of the individual concerned. Admittedly all these services cost money, but they cost far less than the maintenance of an elderly person in a hospital or institution and what is of equal importance, they provide what is wanted and not what others are apt to think is best for the old person concerned. It is a fact that in old age individuals cling with vigour to the surroundings, neighbourhood, and in fact the premises to which they have been accustomed in their earlier years. In the pages of this report will be found a detailed description of the work carried out in connection with the Hygiene of Food Premises. I use the word " detailed " on purpose because it is often in the attention to detail that improvement in food hygiene must be sought. It may be, for example, lack of attention to detail that causes an outbreak of food poisoning. Over 3,000 visits were made to premises where food is prepared or sold and a long list will be found indicating improvements which it was possible to effect in these premises. I would assure the Council that we have the help and co-operation of every type of person associated with the food industry and an attempt is made to meet with the requirements of your Inspectors in practically every case. It is very seldom that we find lack of co-operation. This applies not only to the 5 larger firms in the Borough but equally to the staff and to individuals concerned in stalls throughout the Borough and on the Heath at fair time. Our work in connection with the Heath continues, and shows increasingly good results. In 1948 only 37 5 per cent. of the samples of ice-cream taken at the fair were found to be satisfactory. In 1951, this percentage had risen to 77 8. I am still somewhat worried as to the temporary sanitary accommodation provided for the Easter, Whitsun and August Bank Holiday Fairs. The problem is difficult, for it is undesirable that any permanent structure should be erected for these short periods and thus interfere with the appearance and amenities of the Heath. Provision on such a scale moreover, would not be essential except on these few days of the year. On the other hand, the temporary arrangements leave much to be desired and I am in consultation with the officers of the London County Council to see what improvements may be obtained. During 1951 a visit was made to every hairdressing establishment in the Borough and in these pages will be found the report which was presented to the Council. It is pleasant to record that generally the barbers and hairdressers premises in the Borough were found to be satisfactory from a public health point of view. I am of opinion that these surveys of particular trades are of great value. Apart from the assurance which we were able to give the Council, we also tendered much advice to the proprietors of the various establishments and I would like to acknowledge the co-operation which we received. Your Sanitary Inspectors have paid visits on persons resident in the Borough who are listed as blind, in order that we might co-operate with the County Council officers in the welfare of those concerned. It has been possible to remedy various environmental defects which have come to light as a result of these visits. The work of the Department has embraced the examination of houses where application has been made under the Housing Act, 1949, for a grant towards the acquisition of property. The Council must satisfy itself that the property to be acquired is, or will be made, in all respects fit for human habitation. We are also securing that the provisions of the Pet Animals Act, 1951, and the Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951, are enforced. I think it is fair to say that the public appreciate the help which your Council is able to render through its Public Health Department. Throughout the year, no less than 2,317 requests were made to the Department for help and the number of visits and re-inspections made by your Sanitary Inspectors totalled over 20,000. 1,411 intimation notices were written to owners informing them of defects in their property. In 419 cases it was necessary to serve a statutory notice and court proceedings were necessary in only 10 cases to enforce the execution of work. The Sanitary Inspector should be accepted as the friend of those in need of help and the advisor of those who have to remedy defects. It should be exceptional for him to have to threaten the force of law or the commencement of legal proceedings and by and large this is the position in the Borough of Hampstead. 6 May I express my thanks for the never failing help and courtesy I have received from the Public Health Committee and the Council and for the co-operation I have had from my colleagues throughout the whole of the year. I would also like to express my thanks to Dr. Oldershaw, the Divisional Medical Officer of the London County Council, and to the members of his staff. It is impossible to divorce the personal health services which are administered by the London County Council from the general health of the population for which the Hampstead Borough Council is responsible, and co-ordination is obviously essential. To secure this, I have met Dr. Oldershaw together with the senior members of his staff regularly throughout the year, and in a spirit of friendly cooperation we have been able to unify the aims and objects of both Councils in the Borough of Hampstead. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, DENNIS GEFFEN, Medical Officer of Health. 7 PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE. (as at 31st December, 1951.)

One was in the person of a female aged 13 years, the other a male aged 20 years. There were no deaths. MASS X-RAY. Messrs. Mansell, Hunt, Catty & Co., Ltd., very kindly made part of their premises available for the Mass X-ray Unit, and the Unit was in operation during the four days 15th, 18th, 19th and 20th June. Among those who attended were 252 employees of the Borough Council. In addition to Hampstead residents and employees it was considered that this was a suitable opportunity to offer the services of the Unit to all the schools in the Borough in an endeavour to secure the attendance of the school staffs and the children of school leaving age. 11 The detailed result of the visit is as follows:- [####] Males. Females. Total.[/####] No. of adults attending 592 437 1,029 No. of school children and staff attending 346 686 1,032 No. recalled for further X-ray (large film) 14 11 25 Analysis of large films. No further action 11 6 17 Further medical advice recommended 2 5 7 To attend for re-check at later date 1 - 1 It will be seen that out of the total of 2,061 persons who attended for X-ray, 7 were found to require further medical advice, i.e., 0·34 per cent., and one was advised to attend later for a re-check. In December the Unit paid a two week visit to the Main Restaurant, Zoological Gardens, Regent's Park, and a letter was sent to some seventy factories and institutions in the Borough informing them of the opportunity for their staff to be X-rayed. The facilities were also available to a number of other Boroughs and no summary of attendances and results in respect of Hampstead people is available in respect of this survey. FOOD POISONING. During the year we received 23 notifications of cases of food poisoning. Many of these were isolated cases but in three instances there was an outbreak affecting a number of individuals. One of these was associated with the purchase of duck eggs infected with the germs of dysentery. The source of infection was actually traced to the farm at which the ducks were kept and even to individual ducks. In another case an outbreak was associated with a school and in the third with a hostel. In all cases appropriate action terminated the outbreak. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. (Infectious Diseases.) The record of examinations carried out during the year by the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, is as follows:- [####]Throat/Nose Swabs.[/####] Diphtheria Bacilli found Nil Hæmolytic Streptococci found 23 Vincent's Angina organisms found 3 Negative 115 Fæces. Shigella found 52 Salmonella found 19 Negative 134 Sputum. T.B. found 2 Other organisms found 3 Negative 13 Pertussis. Negative 21 (6003) a 4 12 DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION. The following is a record of the work carried out by the Disinfecting Staff during 1951:- Number of houses or parts of houses and contents disinfected 665 Number of verminous rooms disinfested 309 Number of steam chamber operations 1,962 Number of calls by borough van 4,037 Number of rooms disinfected after I.D 356 CLEANSING AND DISINFECTION OF VERMINOUS PERSONS AND THEIR BELONGINGS. The following cleansings and medicinal baths were carried out at the Borough Council Cleansing Centre, during the year, where 14 adults and 18 children received treatment:- Verminous conditions:- Adults 11 Children under 5 6 Children over 5 11 Scabies:- Adults 11 Children under 5 - Children over 5 26 During the year, 309 verminous rooms in 174 houses were cleansed and freed from vermin. 16 cases of scabies were notified during the year. These were investigated by the Sanitary Inspectors and, where necessary, treatment arranged at the Public Health Station. During the year, the following treatments were carried out at the Centre on behalf of the London County Council:- Verminous conditions:- No. of school children treated 128 No. of treatments given 132 No. of pre-school children treated No. of treatments given Scabies:- No. of school children treated 8 No. of treatments given 17 No. of pre-school children treated - No. of treatments given The annual number of cases of scabies notified since the war is as follows:- 1945 196 1946 197 1947 88 1948 36 1949 24 1950 24 1951 16 13 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, SECTION 50. Daring the year 12 funerals were carried out under the National Assistance Act, 1948. In six cases the deceased was an elderly person living alone without known relatives or friends. In one case the deceased left a widow whose only income was the old age pension and national assistance allowance. The remaining cases were children-one stillborn, two newly born, one aged 2 minutes, and one aged 1 year 7 months. The total cost of the funerals was £71 13s., and an amount of £49 0s. 9d. was recovered from liable relatives and the estates of deceased persons, of which £10 4s. 9d. was handed over to the Treasury Solicitor. STAFF MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS. 87 medical examinations were carried out of new entrants to the superannuation scheme or of persons on whom a special medical report was required. 79 of these were found to be fit, and 8 unfit. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, SECTION 47. Aged and Infirm Persons. That the work of the Department in dealing with this problem is becoming increasingly known is evident from the large number of cases which are brought to our notice. No less than fifty-nine old and infirm persons were either reported to the Department, or discovered by Sanitary Inspectors during their visits, and broadly speaking the action taken by the Department may be summarised as follows: — (1) Number placed on Emergency Beds Service list for urgent admission to hospital, or other approach made to hospitals to expedite admissions 29 (2) Number of cases admitted to L.C.C. homes 7 (3) Number of cases admitted to other homes 8 (4) Number of cases referred to Senior Mental Welfare Officer, L.C.C., and subsequently admitted to hospital 4 (5) Number of cases where the assistance of the appropriate organisation was enlisted: — (a) Home Help Service 25 (b) District Nursing Association 13 (c) Meals Service (British Red Cross) 10 In addition, many other cases, already known to us, were revisited and appropriate assistance rendered where necessary. Liaison is maintained with the Hampstead Old People's Association, who are voluntarily doing excellent work in the Borough. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD. Hygiene of Food Premises. This work continues to develop and the public interest has been maintained by talks, discussions and demonstrations with local organisations throughout the Borough. Although Model Food By-laws were published by the Ministry of Food as far back as October, 1949, and the majority of local authorities 14 in the Country have adopted them as a basis, the Metropolitan Boroughs are still awaiting the issue of the new By-laws by the London County Council. These should materially assist your Inspectors in obtaining improvements in standards of food hygiene. The following visits were paid to food premises by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year:- No. of inspections. Bakehouses 116 Butchers 315 Confectioners 194 Dairies and Milk Shops 158 Fishmongers 216 Fried Fish Shops 210 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 200 Grocers and Provision Shops 276 Hotels and Licensed Premises 85 Ice-cream Premises 200 Restaurants and Canteens 585 Other Food Premises 171 Other Inspections (Stalls, etc.) 302 3,028 A short summary of the improvements achieved is set out in the following table:- [####]Description of work.

Supplementary licence.[/####] To sell "Pasteurised" Milk 37 25 „ "Sterilised" Milk 38 25 „ "Tuberculin Tested" Milk 31 24 ,, "Accredited" Milk 5 4 Hampstead Heath Fair. As usual members of the Inspectorial staff and their assistants were on duty throughout the Easter, Whitsun and August Bank Holiday fairs. Some idea of the intensive work involved in sampling alone on these fair days may be gauged from the fact that no less than 101 articles of food and drink were submitted to bacteriological examination and 79 to chemical analysis. Included in these figures are 38 samples of Ice-cream which were submitted to the "Methylene Blue" test. It is interesting to compare the improvements over the years since more intensive inspection began as illustrated by the following table: — Year. No. of Samples taken. Grading under Meth. Blue Test. 1 2 3 4 Percentage of Grades 1 and 2 Samples. per cent. 1948 8 Nil 3 2 3 37·5 1949 9 1 2 3 3 33·3 1950 20 10 4 3 3 70 1951 38 23 6 4 5 77·8 These results are significant in the light of the gradually improving hygienic conditions we have been able to secure over the period since 1948, viz.:- (i) Improved siting of food stalls. 16 (ii) The provision of a water supply from the rising main, readily accessible to the stallholders, at 15 additional points. (iii) Improved provisions for the storage of refuse. (iv) Improved conditions at foodstalls, particularly in methods of storage; preparation and handling of foods; the use of sterilants in washing-up water and the provision of drinking straws and waxed cups. I have, once more, to express my gratitude to Dr. Betty Hobbs, Principal of the Food Hygiene Section of the Central Public Health Laboratory Service, Colindale, for the excellent and unfailing co-operation and assistance consistently rendered to the Department by the Laboratory, particularly in connection with fairground catering hygiene problems. In addition, much time and attention has been devoted to the vexed question of the temporary sanitary accommodation which has to be provided for the large crowds attending the Hampstead Heath fairs. Contraventions of Section 13 Food and Drugs Act, 1938 (Precautions against Contamination of Food). Thirty-four summonses were served in respect of dirty conditions at a Restaurant. The proprietor of the restaurant was fined a total of £100 and £21 9s. costs were awarded to the Council. The manageress of the restaurant was also fined £59 with 4s. costs. FOOD SAMPLING. (a) Bacteriological examination of foodstuffs. This service has again been undertaken by the Government's Central Public Health Laboratory free of charge to the Council.

(b) Samples submitted to Chemical Analysis. The total number of samples submitted to the late Public Analyst, Dr. H. E. Cox, was 500, of which 15 or 3 per cent. were classed as adulterated or unsatisfactory. Particulars of Adulterated Samples. Sample No. Article. Offence.

The percentage of adulterated samples in 1950 was 1.6 per cent., in 1949, 3 8 per cent, and in 1948, 4 6 per cent. A more common experience nowadays than the sophistication of foods is the presence therein of foreign objects, contaminants or insects, etc. The affected food usually finds its way to the Public Health Department after the irate customers discover such things as cockroaches, meal worms, or other insects; pieces of metal, string, glass, cigarette ends, or other unwelcome additions in their food purchases. Many such offences are accidental but a number are the result of gross carelessness. Appropriate action was taken in respect of every complaint made. 18 Unsound Food.

No complaint of contamination was received. All the dwelling-houses in the Borough are supplied from public water mains direct to the houses. There are no wells or stand pipes. BATH WATERS. Samples of water were regularly taken for chemical examination and bacteriological analysis from the Hampstead Swimming Baths. These proved to be satisfactory. RODENT AND PEST CONTROL. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949. The above Act came into force on the 3rd March, 1950. It repealed the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919, and substantially strengthens the powers of the local authority in dealing with the control of pests. The Council employ two rodent operators for dealing with rats and mice complaints. Complaints of other pests and vermin are dealt with by the disinfecting staff. The number of complaints of rodents received during the year was 727, of which 308 related to rats and 419 to mice. The figures for 1950 were 662, of which 315 were rat and 347 mouse infestation. One summons for failure to give notice of infestation of mice at food premises resulted in the offender being fined £5 and £1 5s. costs. Other pest infestations dealt with were: — Ants 5 Bugs 116 Cockroaches 186 Fleas 6 Mosquitoes 1 Moths 10 Silver fish 10 As part of the organised campaign throughout the country for the eradication of rats in sewers, the whole of the sewerage system in the Borough was pre-baited and poison-baited twice during the year. Charges for Rodent Extermination. The Public Health Committee resolved that, until otherwise decided, no charge be made for the destruction of rats and mice by the Council at private premises, except in cases where, as a result of the lack of cooperation on the part of the owner or occupier, it was found necessary to serve a notice under section 4 of the Act. Besides relieving the Department of much administrative work, this decision has materially assisted the staff in dealing speedily with complaints of rodent infestation. Charges continue to be made, in accordance with the Ministry's request, in respect of all infestations at business premises. 22 OUTWORKERS. In accordance with the Factories Act, 1937, 25 Hampstead firms sent in lists of persons employed as home workers. Of the 413 persons so employed, 52 only resided in the Hampstead area. Information concerning 85 outworkers resident in Hampstead but employed by firms outside the Borough was received from other authorities. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT, 1933. During the year 111 applications for the renewal of poisons licences were granted. In 3 instances new licences were issued and 2 firms ceased to sell poisons. HAIRDRESSERS' AND BARBERS' ESTABLISHMENTS. On the instructions of the Public Health Committee the Sanitary Inspectors conducted a survey of these establishments during the year. Barbers' and Hairdressers' premises are subject to the provisions of the Shops Act, 1950, which ensures that there shall be a sufficient number of sanitary conveniences for the staffs employed and that the premises shall be properly heated and ventilated. These requirements are enforceable by the Borough Council. In addition to these, the Shops Act deals with early closing days, general closing hours, arrangements for health and comfort of shopworkers and general welfare. These provisions are administered by the London County Council. The Ministry of Local Government and Planning has issued Model By-laws which may be adopted outside London under the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1936. Similar provisions do not appear in the London Government Act and we are advised by the Town Clerk that the Borough Council have no power at the present time to make By-laws for enforcing cleanliness in Barbers' and Hairdressers' shops. The method of obtaining such power would be to secure the insertion of suitable provisions in an L.C.C. (General Powers) Bill by the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee. The following is a copy of the Model By-laws: — 1. In these by-laws "premises" means any premises used for the purpose of carrying on the trade or business of a hairdresser or barber. 2. For the purpose of securing the cleanliness of the premises, every person carrying on the trade or business of a hairdresser or barber shall cause— (a) The surface of all internal walls, partitions and ceilings and the underside of the roof of any room where there is no ceiling to be kept at all times in such repair and to be so painted, distempered, whitewashed, papered or similarly treated in manner appropriate to each such surface and to be so cleansed at such intervals as to maintain the same in a cleanly condition; (b) the floor of every room to be cleansed at least once during everyday on which trade or business is carried on; (c) the floor to be swept as often as may be necessary to prevent the accumulation of hair clippings, neck wool or other litter; 23 (d) a sufficient number of covered receptacles to be provided and all hair clippings, neck wool or other litter swept from the floor or otherwise accumulating in connection with the trade or business to be placed therein. He shall cause every such receptacle to be emptied as often as may be necessary and at least once during every day upon which the trade or business is carried on; (e) every chair or seat to be cleansed as often as may be necessary; (/) every shelf, fitting or table on which instruments, towels, or materials are placed to be kept clean; (g) every washbasin and all fixtures and fittings used in connection therewith to be kept clean. For the purpose of securing the cleanliness of the instruments, towels, materials and equipment used in the premises, every person carrying on the trade or business of a hairdresser or barber shall cause:— (a) each metal instrument to be cleansed before use upon each person; (b) each hairbrush, comb or other similar instrument used for the purposes of the trade or business to be thoroughly washed at least once daily and otherwise kept clean; (c) each shaving brush, sponge or other article similarly used and each shaving mug, or other similar utensil to be cleansed immediately after use for each person so as to ensure that no dirt, soap, lather or other matter remains adhering thereto; (d) where neck wool or other material is used any one piece of such wool or material to be used for not more than one person; provided that if a material other than wool is used which is capable of being cleansed this by-law shall not operate so as to prevent the subsequent use of any one piece of material after being cleansed; (e) any styptic, not applied by means of a spray or upon fresh cotton wool or other clean material, to be clean; (/) soap, other than liquid or powders or tube soap or shaving cream, to be thoroughly rinsed before use for each separate person; (g) every towel or other similar article used in connection with the trade or business to be clean; (h) paper or linen placed on the back of the chair or head rest to be clean; (i) a fresh supply of water for each person to be used for shaving, lathering or washing. For the purpose of securing the cleanliness of the persons employed in the premises in regard to both themselves and their clothing, any person carrying on the trade or business of a hairdresser or barber shall cause every hairdresser or barber while employed on the premises to keep his hands, his clothes and any overall which he may wear in a cleanly condition. 24 Statistics. (1) Total number of Barbers' and Hairdressers' shops in the Borough of Hampstead 66 (2) Catering for men only 18 (3) ,, ,, ladies only 34 (4) ,, ,, both sexes 14 (5) Total number of staff engaged on this work:— Males 84 Females 146 230 The following is a Summary of the position in the Borough of Hampstead:— (1) No. of premises found to comply in all respects with the Shops Act and the Model By-laws, in that no unclean- liness or other defect was noted 48 (2) No. of premises failing to comply with the By-laws in the following respects: — (a) General cleanliness of premises-, painting and decoration, etc. 14 (b) General cleanliness of floors and receptacles for litter 2 (c) Sanitary conveniences: defective, unsuitable or insufficient 5 (d) Washing facilities: inadequate or defective 2 (e) Lighting and ventilation: inadequate or defective 2 (/) Water supplies: inadequate hot and cold supplies 4 (g) Instruments: hairbrushes, combs, shaving brushes, clippers, etc., inadequate cleansing 4 (h) Disinfection of brushes, scissors, etc., unsatisfactory 1 Arrangements for cleansing, disinfection and sterilization of overalls, towels, brushes, instruments and other equipment vary considerably. Overalls and Towels. Overalls are usually shaken after being used and re-used again. In some saloons these overalls are laundered two or three times a week. Towels and hand towels used for shampooing, shaving and hairdressing in barbers' premises are used once only and then sent to the laundry by 24 establishments. The majority of the remaining premises have a good supply of towels, which are frequently changed. In some cases, cotton wool is used. It is the practice to destroy it and to use fresh for each customer. In other cases we have seen tissues used, a practice which we commend. Hairbrushes, combs, etc. In ten premises such equipment is used once only and then washed and disinfected: in 37 cases this is done twice daily; in others this practice varies from thrice a week to weekly. Hairbrushes are not used at all in 10 saloons. 25 Disinfectants and Antiseptics. It is the general practice to use some form of disinfectant or antiseptic solution in which equipment is either kept, dipped after use or washed. So-called "sterilizing cabinets" were found to be unsatisfactory in that the formalin or other disinfecting agent was absent. We were satisfied that generally Barbers' and Hairdressers' premises in the Borough of Hampstead were satisfactory from a public health point of view and we wish to acknowledge the co-operation we received from the proprietors, who were most helpful during the whole course of the investigation.

STAFF. The permanent establishment of Sanitary Inspectors was increased by one during the year, bringing the Inspectorial staff up to 12, including the Chief and Deputy Chief Inspectors, as compared with 8 in 1914. The population per Sanitary Inspector in Hampstead is now 1 :8,146. Mr. Sidney King was appointed a full-time Mortuary Keeper, vice Mr. P. Not, who was formerly employed as Mortuary Keeper-cumAssistant to the Sanitary Inspectors and who resigned during the year. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. The administration of this Act falls to the Public Health Department, and the Sanitary Inspectors and I have been authorised to act as Inspection Officers. Although this is a comparatively modest additional burden, there are some somewhat complex practical difficulties arising in connection with the licensing and inspection of pet shops, whch require careful investigation. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951. This Act came into operation on the 1st November, 1951, and is another example of the diverse legislation with which the officers of the Public Health Department must cope. The Act makes it obligatory for manufacturers, retailers, and other users of rag flock or other prescribed filling materials to be registered or licensed by the local authority as the case may be. Upholstering, etc., may only be done on registered premises. Offences in respect of the manufacture and sale of unclean filling materials are prescribed, also powers of entry, inspection and sampling. WHITESTONE POND. I continue to receive complaints, during the summer period especially, of this pond being unfit for children bathing and paddling. The following precautions continue to be taken by the Council:— (1) The pond is regularly emptied and cleansed. (2) During the summer the pond is dosed twice daily with sodium hypochlorite and copper sulphate. (3) Notices are erected drawing attention to the fact that the pond is not maintained for bathing and paddling. FLOODING BY STORM WATER. The sewer relief works were completed early in 1949, and although there has been no rainstorm quite comparable with those which caused the previous floodings, it is again gratifying to report that there has been no inundation of dwelling-houses in the Sumatra Road and Netherwood Street areas. Nevertheless, the Borough Engineer emphasises that the works which have been carried out cannot, owing to the physical condition of the areas concerned, be regarded as a remedy for all flooding. 27 Twelve underground rooms were closed during the year, not only because they did not comply with the Underground Room Regulations, but on account of their liability to flooding. INCREASE OF RENT AND MORTGAGE INTEREST (RESTRICTIONS) ACTS. No certificate was issued during the year. HOUSING. 1. Total number of dwelling-houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health or Housing Acts) 3,104 2. Number of dwelling-houses (included in (1) above) which were inspected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations, 1925 and 1932 33 3. Number of dwelling-houses found to be in a state so ous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation 3 4. Number of dwelling-houses found not to be in all respects fit for human habitation 1,411 HOUSING ACT, 1936. PART II. Sections 11 & 12. Closing Orders were made or undertakings accepted in respect of twenty underground rooms at ten premises. There are many other premises in the Borough which warrant procedure under this part of the Act, but action thereon is impossible whilst the present rehousing situation continues. HOUSING ACT, 1936. Sections 9, 10 & 16. Action under Statutory Powers. Number of dwelling-houses in respect of which Notices were served requiring repairs 18 Number of dwelling-houses which were rendered fit after service of formal notices 15 Number of dwelling-houses where works were in progress at the end of the year 2 Number of premises rendered fit by the Owners after service of informal notices 2 (These were houses which could not be rendered fit at "reasonable expense " in accordance with Section 9.) This work has again been carried out by Mr. W. Robinson, Deputy Chief Sanitary Inspector, under conditions of increasing difficulty. Building repairs and materials costs have risen, and are still rising, so steeply that rents which have remained controlled are quite insufficient to provide for even the minimum amount of works of maintenance and repair required to preserve the fabric of buildings. Nevertheless, this work has proceeded throughout the year with but one appeal to the County Court against the requirements of a Section 9 notice and this appeal was subsequently withdrawn prior to the hearing. 28 THE PROVISION OF HOUSING ACCOMMODATION. The Housing Estates Manager has supplied me with the following information: — NEW HOUSING ESTATES. During 1951, progress was made in the provision of new housing schemes, as follows:— Primrose Hill Court. In the first half of the year, 68 further flats were brought into occupation to complete this housing scheme. The new estate was officially opened on 30th June, 1951, by Mr. Councillor Arthur Bucknell, who served as Chairman of the Housing Committee from 1949 to 1951, and whose former home on this housing site was completely destroyed by enemy action in November, 1944. The Scheme comprises 102 flats. The estimated cost of land and buildings is £242,000. Kilburn Gate. With the occupation of a further 52 flats, this housing scheme was completed during the year. The estate was officially opened on 14th June, 1951, by the Deputy Mayor of Hampstead, Alderman R. J. Cleaver, who had recently completed a period of office as Mayor from 1949 to 1951. The completed first stage of this scheme comprises 60 flats. The estimated cost of land and buildings is £147,000. The name "Kilburn Gate" is derived from the old Kilburn Turnpike Gate, which, prior to 1864, was in Kilburn High Road in the neighbourhood of the new flats. Agamemnon Road. The Agamemnon Road Scheme is a first example of the development of a small site by the Borough Council. On this site the Council erected during the year a terrace of eight three-storey houses, each with its own small garden. This is the Council's first opportunity to build houses in Hampstead for although the majority of families with children would prefer houses, it is usually necessary to build flats in order to provide the greatest number of homes within a given area. The estimated cost of the land and buildings is £20,000. West End Lane. Building work continued during 1951 on the 80 flats in this scheme. The contract date of completion is March, 1952, but delays in the progress of the work, outside the control of the Council, have occurred. It is anticipated, however, that a first block of fourteen flats will be ready for occupation in March, 1952. The estimated cost of the land and buildings is £202,000. 29 The name given to the new housing scheme is "Sidney Boyd Court" in appreciation of Mr. Alderman Boyd who served as Mayor for seven years, including the whole period of World War II, and who is the Senior Freeman of the Borough. Shoot-Up Hill. Building work was started on the 112 flats in this scheme on 30th April, 1951. The contract date of completion is January, 1953. The estimated cost of the land and buildings is £259,000. Lawn Road. Building work began 23rd April, 1951, on this block of 25 flats. It is anticipated that the flats will be ready for occupation during the first half of 1952. The estimated cost of the land and buildings is £49,580. The name given to the new flats is "Troyes House," to preserve the association of the site with the Convent known as "Sisters of Bon Secours de Troyes," which was completely destroyed by enemy action in October, 1940. Additional Schemes in various preparatory stages were: No. of dwellings. Broadhurst Gardens 163 Fellows Road 80 Kilburn Gate (second stage) 34 Dennington Park Road 18 Finchley Road 170 Gladys Road 4 Broomsleigh Street 8 Avenue Road 54 Fitzjohn's Avenue 9 Total 540 Other housing sites have received preliminary consideration. Requisitioned Properties. At the end of the year the total number of dwellings in requisitioned properties was 1,536. This represents a decrease of 35 dwellings during the year, due chiefly to the release of properties from requisition at the request of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, owing to dilapidations and structural defects, etc. Preparatory work on the provision of accommodation for an additional eighteen families was in progress. Requisitioned properties are controlled by the Council on behalf of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, which bears financial responsibility. War Damage. Building licences were issued during the year for the repair of severely damaged and unoccupied premises to provide a total of 12 30 dwellings. Licences were also issued for the rebuilding of war-destroyed " Cost of Works " houses to provide an additional 22 dwellings. Private Conversions and Buildings. During 1951, building licences were issued for the conversion of large houses by private owners to provide a total of 53 dwellings. The Council were permitted by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government to issue licences for the building of 32 dwellings by private enterprise:—8 in Hampstead and 24 in other areas by arrangement with the local authorities concerned. The Minister of Housing and Local Government has now given greater freedom to local authorities in the issuing of building licences to private persons and has arranged for more licences to be available for this purpose. Application forms for building licences may be obtained from the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, Town Hall, N.W.3; each application submitted to the Council will be considered on its merits from the point of view of housing need. Applications for Accommodation. Accommodation was found by the Council during 1951 for the families of 189 applicants comprising 593 persons. The number of families on the waiting list at 31st December, 1951, was 4,928. During the year no less than 1,492 housing applications were referred to my department for a Sanitary Inspector's report as to the urgency of the case. This is nearly three times the number dealt with during the previous year. These reports were supplied not only to our own Housing Estates Department but also to the London County Council and other Local Authorities, from whom enquiries were received. A large number of housing applicants base their claims primarily on insanitary conditions, and appropriate action is taken by the service of sanitary notices where the complaints are well founded. Housing Act, 1949. Applications for Mortgages, Improvement Grants, etc. Part 1. Amendments of the Housing Act, 1936. Section 1 removes limitations in the Housing Acts on the powers of local authorities by the deletion of references to the "working classes" in all the sections in the Housing Act, 1936, with certain exceptions. The effect is: — (a) To make it the duty of the local authority when preparing and submitting to the Minister proposals for the provision of new houses under section 71 of the Housing Act, 1936, to consider the housing conditions and housing needs of all the inhabitants of their district, and to empower the authority to provide housing accommodation for all members of the community. (b) To bring all houses within the ambit of the provisions in Part II of the Housing Act, 1936, relating to the repair, demolition and closing of insanitary premises. 31 (c) To extend, so as to include all persons, the obligation of the local authority to provide rehousing accommodation, in so far as suitable accommodation is not available, where displacements are effected in connection with clearance and improvement areas under Part III of the Housing Act, 1936. (d) To extend, so as to include all persons, the rehousing obligations imposed by section 137 of and the Eleventh Schedule to the Housing Act, 1936, on statutory undertakers who have been given power to acquire houses occupied by thirty or more people. Section 3 is of great interest to Hampstead and provides for the substitution of a closing order for a demolition order in the case of houses of special architectural or historic interest where such a house is unfit for human habitation, and is incapable of being made fit at reasonable expense. A provisional list of such premises in the Borough was compiled by the Minister of Town and Country Planning in 1950 and has since been amended. Section 4 enables local authorities to make advances for the purpose of increasing housing accommodation. Loans may be made for: — (a) acquiring houses; (b) constructing houses; (c) converting houses; (d) altering, enlarging, repairing or improving houses. Before advancing money for the purpose specified in (a) above, the local authority must satisfy themselves that the premises to be acquired are, or will be made, in all respects fit for human habitation. Much time has been devoted to this important work and very full consideration has been given to the Standard of Fitness which should be adopted in dealing with applications for loans. We have decided in consultation with the Town Clerk that the appropriate standard should be similar to that which is applied in serving notices under section 9, Housing Act, 1936, modified to exclude items of general wear and tear, unless the defects are of a really serious nature. The standard is not inflexible and is capable of modification in special circumstances. The following factors are also taken into consideration: — (a) Underground Rooms. In the case of basements let separately, the question of making the rooms comply with the Regulations except in those cases where the basement rooms are used only as kitchens, sculleries or storage rooms. (b) Drainage. Each case is considered on its merits but a drainage test is carried out where it is thought such a test is warranted. Whether this be a stringent water test, or a chemical or smoke test, depends upon the conditions found at the individual house. (c) Tenement Houses or Houses let in Lodgings. The By-laws are applied wherever necessary where the house is occupied by more than one family. Reports were made on nine applications for loans under this section and I was able to certify in each case that the house was or could be 32 made fit in all respects upon compliance with the Sanitary Inspector's schedule of defects.
