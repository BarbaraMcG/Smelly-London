To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Southall. MR. MAYOR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have the honour to present the 69th Annual Report on the health and circumstances of the population of the Borough of Southall. The birth rate, which had been rising, decreased in 1959 and there was a slight fall in the number of premature infants born. The number of deaths occurring during the year was very slightly increased over the 1958 figure, but it is interesting to note a considerable drop in the number of deaths from cancer, which were 139 in 1958 and 115 in 1959. The number of deaths from tuberculosis was the lowest yet recorded. There was the same total of infant deaths as during the previous year. Infectious disease was not a great problem in 1959. The comparative figures showed an increase over the previous year, most of which was due to measles. No notifications of diphtheria were received, and for the first year since notification was first made compulsory, no case of poliomyelitis was notified. One disturbing factor in the infectious disease table was that scarlet fever incidence rose for the second year in succession. Tuberculosis notifications showed an increase. At the beginning of the year it seemed as if influenza was going to assume epidemic proportions, and indeed the number suffering from this disease in its milder form was considerable, but a major epidemic of influenza did not occur. 5 Overcrowding of houses, while continuing to be a serious problem, did not appear to intensify during 1959, but the amount of house building within the Borough was not large and indeed cannot in the foreseeable future be very great unless upward building is undertaken. An increased number of the overcrowded families on the Department's register obtained better housing accommodation during the year, but with limited land available for building, increasing restriction on the numbers who can be decanted to New Towns, and as can be seen from the vital statistics a natural increase in population even if no immigration occurs, the problem does not seem likely to lessen. Much work was carried out in inspection and health education in food premises and the general standard of hygiene in food shops and catering establishments in the Borough is showing marked improvement. It is possible that the low figures for food poisoning and dysentery in the Borough may be partly attributable to this. Work on the survey and preparation for the making of Southall into a smoke free area increased very greatly during 1959 and the first smoke control area was designated and approved, inspection of the second being started immediately on the completion of the inspections for the first. Special facilities were made available to the general public for the explanation to householders of the requirements in a smoke control area. The figures for the atmospheric pollution of the Borough for the past two years have been sufficiently disturbing to emphasise the desirability of the rapid extension of smoke control. Services for the welfare of old age pensioners continued to expand. Although these are not statutory but are operated by voluntary associations, the Council give sympathetic consideration to all applications from these associations for assistance, either for money or for provision of meeting places; the Meals on Wheels service, particularly, expanded during the year, and plans were made for an even greater expansion in 1960. An increase was made in the number of old people (some for the first time for many years) sent for a short holiday at the sea. Health education continued throughout the year on many subjects, with particular emphasis on home safety and food hygiene. I would like to thank the whole of the staff of the Public Health Department for all the good work done during the year and for their loyal support. I am, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Margaret a. Glass Medical Officer of Health. Manor House, Southall. Telephone Numbers: SOU 3621-2.

Its boundaries are clearly defined on the east side by the River Brent, on the west by the Grand Union Canal and Yeading Brook, and on about half of its southern side the canal forms again a natural water barrier. The distance between the eastern and western boundaries and the northern and southern are roughly equal. Travelling by the main roads, it is roughly 2½ miles each way from boundary to boundary. The Borough, which was country only 50 years ago, is very fully built up now, partly with residential and partly with industrial building. The practice in the past has been to build no higher than three floors in the residential areas, but the need for more housing accommodation has resulted in introducing multi-storey flats. At present the highest in the Borough are four storey blocks. Certain features of industrial undertakings, i.e. the gas holder of the North Thames Gas 9 Board, and one factory building, have for many years been highly elevated above Southall's sky line so there seems no aesthetic argument against upward development to help with the housing problem. Factories in the district are mainly concerned with light engineering, but there are some large food factories, there are also chemical works, paint, dye and wood works, manufacturing chemists, laundries, etc. There are no trades carried on which are at present scheduled as offensive trades. Swimming Bath The Southall Borough Council maintains an outdoor swimming pool in the Recreation Ground, which is one of the public parks, and this pool is used very fully during the summer months. The surface area of the bath is 3,600 square feet (120 feet by 30 feet), cubic capacity 16,500 cubic feet (110,000 gallons). The water is treated by break point chlorination and the normal chlorine content of 10 parts per million at the shallow end and 0.7 at the deep end is maintained. During peak periods this is increased to 4.0 parts per million at the shallow end in order to obtain 2.0parts per million at the deep end. A minimum of three samples of the water are taken daily by the staff of the Baths Superintendent for chlorine and other chemical testing, and from time to time bacteriological testing is carried out by officers from the Public Health Department. At no time during 1959 was the water found to be unsatisfactory for use by swimmers. As this bath is closed during the winter months it can be fully emptied and repaired, if necessary, and cleansed each year before the spring opening. During 1959 the total number of persons using the bath was 61,277 (28,967 in 1958). The average number of persons attending per day was 401. The maximum number at any one session was 450. The attendance during 1959 was very high indeed as was to be expected in a year when the daily average of sunshine right through the summer months was the highest in this country for very many years. Paddling Pool A paddling pool for young children is available in Cranleigh Gardens Play Park. The capacity of the pool is approximately 15,500 gallons with depth from 1½ inches to 9 inches. The water of the pool is free running and is treated by continuous chlorination for hygiene purposes. Like the swimming bath, this pool was in constant and very full use during the summer of 1959. In order to ensure a more thorough distribution of disinfectant throughout the water of the Pool, new polythene piping was introduced and the supply points for the ingoing water stationed in such a way that no corners of the Pool could remain stagnant. Before introduction of these new pipes, careful tracing of the water currents was made by means of coloured dyes and the subsequent results of bacteriological tests of the water have proved satisfactory. School Playing Fields For the physical training, school games and recreation of school children the total acreage of school playing fields in Southall is approximately 22. At present considerable use is also made of the play parks within the Council's public parks and negotiations are proceeding for the acquisition of three further areas of land suitable for playing fields. 10 VITAL STATISTICS Total Deaths, 641. (Males, 327: Females, 314.) Crude Death Rate, 12.12. For extracts from vital statistics and causes of death, see Appendix, Tables I and II. Deaths and Death Rate The death rate, i.e. the number of deaths per 1,000 total population, rose in 1959. Below is shown the comparative figures for the past seven years. Year Death Rate 1953 13.31 1954 12.16 1955 11.92 1956 12.25 1957 13.02 1958 12.04 1959 12.12 The principal causes of death were again heart disease, diseases of the circulatory system and cancer. The number of deaths from heart disease and the number of deaths from circulatory diseases including coronary diseases did not vary much from the previous year's figures, but it is noteworthy that when the coronary disease figures are considered on their own there is a considerable increase. Deaths from cancer fell from 139 in 1958 to 115 in 1959. The number of lung cancer deaths was 36 in 1959 as compared with 38 in 1958. There were no deaths from whooping cough, diphtheria or poliomyelitis. A fall occurred in the number of deaths from tuberculosis from 5 in 1958 to 2 in 1959. This is the lowest level yet reached. Twelve people died from influenza. The number of outside deaths, i.e. of Southall residents who died in Hillingdon Hospital, other Middlesex hospitals and hospitals outside the County boundaries, including various London hospitals, was 253 (males 150 and females 103). Deaths of institution inmates (including patients from Southall addresses and from outside areas) number as follows: St. Bernard's Hospital, 156 (males 58 and females 98); Mount Pleasant Hospital, 8 (2 male and 6 female); Southall-Norwood Hospital, 12 (6 male and 6 female); Vine Cottage, 5 (1 male and 4 female); in addition 3 deaths (2 male and 1 female) occured of persons belonging to other districts and residing temporarily in Southall. In 1959, five people died as the result of motor vehicle accidents, as compared with 3 in 1958. It is regrettable that there has not been a year free from motor vehicle accident deaths since 1954. The total number of deaths from violent causes was recorded as 30 in 1959 as compared with 22 in 1958. However, of those deaths registered in 1959, five occurred as the result of an accident in 1958 when an aeroplane crashed on houses in Southall causing loss of life and injury—although the incident was in 1958, returns of registrations were not available during that year, and the numbers have to be included in the 1959 total—which is thereby slightly falsified. To make an approximate allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that of England and Wales as a whole, the crude death rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar-General. This, then, gives a comparative death rate of 11 -39, compared with the rate for England and Wales as a whole, which was 11 -6—the Southall rate is still a little below that of the nation as a whole. For distribution of deaths in the various wards, see Appendix, Table III. Births and Birth Rate. (Figures for 1958 are given in brackets.) The total number of registered births in the district (as notified under the Births and Deaths Registration Act) was 171 (168). The total number of live births belonging to the 11 district, whether occurring within or outside the district, was 743 (831). The illegitimate live births were 55 (42). There were 10 stillbirths (11), 8 legitimate, 2 illegitimate. A fall in the birth rate (live and still) is recorded from 15.73 in 1958 to 14.23 in 1959. The birth rate is the number of births ner 1,000 of the total population. Fifty-five illegitimate live births were registered during 1959. The following table shows the comparative figures for the past 25 years. Year No. of Illegitimate Live Births 1935 23 1936 24 1937 38 1938 31 1939 34 1940 31 1941 30 1942 38 1943 39 1944 55 1945 60 1946 56 1947 53 1948 53 1949 39 1950 36 1951 28 1952 26 1953 31 1954 23 1955 21 1956 38 1957 37 1958 42 1959 55 To make an approximate allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that for England and Wales as a whole, the birth rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar-General. The corrected live birth rate was 14.6. The corresponding rate for the whole of England and Wales was 16.5. The illegitimate birth rate was 74-0 per 1,000 live births. Infant Mortality Infant mortality, i.e. the number of children dying before reaching the age of one year, rose in 1959. The same total number of infants died, i.e. seventeen, but as the number of births was less the rate per 1,000 live births rose from 20.73 in 1958 to 22.88. Of these 17 deaths, 2 died at home and 15 in hospital. Thirteen infants (7 male and 6 female) died within the first four weeks after birth. Table V gives the causes of infant deaths under the age of one year. Graph A, on infant mortality rates, shows the trend of the infant mortality rate since 1900. The infant mortality rate for Middlesex County was 19.4 and the infant mortality rate for England and Wales as a whole was 22.0, the lowest ever recorded in this country. For the first time it appears that the Southall rate has gone above that for Middlesex and also above the national average. One infant death recorded by the Registrar in 1959 occurred in 1958 as a result of the aeroplane crash incident in Kelvin Gardens, Southall. 12 Graph A Infant Mortality Rate from 1900 to 1959 Premature Infants Fifty-five premature infants were born alive during the year; 48 were born in hospital and of these, 42 were surviving at the end of one month; 7 were born at home and all of these were surviving at the end of one month. There were three premature still births, all occurring in hospital. The classification of a premature infant is given to a child born prematurely, or which weighs less than 5½ lbs. at birth. Maternal Morbidity One case of puerperal pyrexia was notified during the year. In addition 7 mothers from Southall were notified to other authorities as having developed puerperal pyrexia in hospital, i.e. 5 in Perivale Maternity Hospital, 1 in Hillingdon Hospital, 1 in Paddington General Hospital. There was one maternal death, and no deaths associated with abortion. 13 PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES There was a rise in the total number of notifications of infectious diseases during 1959. Measles accounted for most of the increase, but there was also a sharp rise in the incidence of scarlet fever, a disease which has been thought to be nearly conquered. Notifications of pneumonia were down. Dysentery and food poisoning, though not extensive, were slightly increased. No cases of diphtheria were notified, and for the first time since the disease became notifiable, no cases of poliomyelitis. Monthly Bulletins of Incidence of Infectious Disease These bulletins were circulated monthly to all general practitioners in the Borough, and, in addition to information with regard to infectious diseases occurring during the previous month, any topical matter, or incident of mutual interest to general practitioners and the Public Health Service, was also included. Measles Measles incidence showed an increase during the year 1959. There were no deaths from measles. The following table shows the trend of notifications during the past ten years. Year No. of Cases Deaths 1950 701 - 1951 1,129 - 1952 528 - 1953 931 1 1954 41 - 1955 1,329 - 1956 61 - 1957 674 1 1958 476 - 1959 674 - Poliomyelitis No notifications of anterior poliomyelitis were received in 1959. Vaccination against poliomyelitis, which is organised by Middlesex County Health Department, continued throughout 1959, and details are as follows. Receiving Persons born 1933-1942 Children born 1943-59 Expectant Mothers G.Ps and families Ambulance Personnel tal Staff Two injections during year Third injections during year (already recorded as having two injections) 2,711 2,280 304 10 27 27 826 5,158 245 8 11 16 14 Influenza At the end of 1958 there were signs that influenza was on the increase and from mid January to mid March the incidence was heavy—schools were considerably handicapped by absences of staff for this reason. There were 12 deaths from influenza. Dysentery Thirty-eight notifications of dysentery were received in 1959. Of these, 15 were confirmed as caused by Shigella Sonnei, one as amoebic dysentery. Two cases notified as dysentery were subsequently confirmed as food poisoning and six notified as gastro-enteritis were subsequentiy confirmed as Sonne Dysentery. The amoebic dysentery occurred in an Indian immigrant and contacts were found to be clear of the disease. Of the other confirmed cases, in one instance two members of one family were affected and in one instance three members; the others were isolated cases, with no apparent spread of infection. Smallpox (Variola) No cases of smallpox occurred in the Borough during the year. No contacts of smallpox were notified from the Port Authorities, or from the Airport Authorities. Vaccination against Smallpox The total figures for vaccination showed a slight improvement in 1959, and the percentage of children receiving vaccination during their first year of life rose from 45 in 1957 to 52 in 1958, rose again to reach 55 in 1959, and as this figure has been falling for years it is satisfactory to find an upward trend now. 1959 Age Groups Under 1 year 1-2 years 2-4 years 5-14 years 15 years and over Total Primary Vaccination 412 33 29 29 45 548 Re-vaccination - - 4 12 117 133 1958 Age Groups Under 1 year 1-2 years 2-4 years 5-14 years 15 years and over Total Primary Vaccination 412 21 18 26 40 517 Re-vaccination - - 1 11 106 118 Scarlet Fever (Scarlatina) The number of notifications received during the year was 124 as compared with 45 for the previous year. There were five secondary cases, i.e. occurring within three weeks following the notification of a previous case in the same household. This infection, which 15 in 1958 showed an increase, has been much more prevalent in 1959, and although the cases are mostly mild, there is now and again one more severe with ear, heart or kidney complications. The disease, which had seemed to be disappearing, is still one to be treated with considerable care and good isolation. All the cases were, however, nursed at home, except one who was admitted to St. John's Hospital, Uxbridge. Diphtheria No cases of diphtheria were notified to the Department. The following information supplied by the Area Medical Officer shows the number of children immunised against diphtheria during the year. Number of Children who completed a full course of Primary Immunisation in Southall during the year r of Children who were given Secondary or Reinforcing Injection during the year (i.e. having in a previous year received a complete full course) Ages at Date of Final Injection Under 1 1-4 5-14 Total 480 111 13 604 55 In the following table is shown the number of children at 31st December, 1958, who had completed a course of immunisation against diphtheria at any time before that date:— Age at 31.12.59: Under 1 1-4 5-9 10-14 Total under 15 Number immunised 175 2,076 2,630 3,767 8,648 The immunisation state of the child population seems to be decreasing, though not to a great extent at present—there is no material increase or decrease in the figures in general. Ophthalmia Neonatorum No case of ophthalmia neonatorum was notified during the year. Tuberculosis Notifications Pulmonary The number of new cases notified during the year was 69. Other Forms The number of new cases notified during the year was 16. Of the total notifications, which include new cases and inward transfers from other districts, 7 were received from medical practitioners; 56 from the Uxbridge Chest Clinic; 11 from General Hospitals; and 11 from St. Bernard's Hospital. The number of new notifications rose from 80 in 1958 to 85 in 1959. Of the 85, 21 were inward transfers, i.e. they were not resident in Southall at the time of development of the disease, and, therefore, the actual figure of new notifications of Southall residents was 64, two of which were subsequentiy diagnosed as non-tuberculous; while in 1958 the number of inward transfers was 25, making the figure for new notifications of Southall residents 55, less two subsequently cancelled. 16 Deaths Tuberculosis of the respiratory system, 2; other forms, 0. For details of new cases notified and deaths in 1959, see Appendix, Table IX, and for the occupation of new cases see Appendix, Table X. Public Health (Prevention of Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1925 Public Health Act, 1936, Section 172 Action under these powers was not necessary during the year. After being able to report a low record for deaths from tuberculosis in 1958, it is satisfactory to show a new low record—only two deaths from this disease having occurred in 1959. This, however, combined with a slight increase in the notification rate, suggests, not that there was less tubercular infection, but that cases were found early enough for treatment to be effective. The amount of tuberculosis amongst Indian residents fell in 1959, comparative figures for the last three years are:— Year New Notifications Number of Indians 1959 64 12 1958 57 14 1957 61 10 In one house occupied by an Indian patient, there had been two previous members of the family affected—one with pulmonary and one with non-pulmonary tuberculosis, but no statutory overcrowding existed at the premises. The analysis of the housing conditions of new cases shows that of the notified patients living in Southall, exclusive of St. Bernard's Hospital notifications, housing conditions were reasonably good in all except two cases. In these cases there was statutory overcrowding. No abatement of the overcrowding had been obtained by the end of 1959. In five families, there were second cases of tuberculosis, and in one of these, three patients were suffering from the disease at the same time. One case remaining in overcrowded conditions since 1956 left the district during 1959. Of the four cases of overcrowding during 1958, two patients have moved to another address in Southall, the remaining two were still not ameliorated at the end of the year. 17 Graph B 1930 '31 '32 '33 '34 '35 '3t "37 '36 '39 '40 '41 '42 '43 '44 '45 '46 '47 '28 '49 '50 '51 '52 '33 '54 '55 '5b '57 '56. '59. Tuberculosis (All Forms)—Notifications and Deaths from 1930 to 1959 Notifications. Deaths 18 Management of Tuberculosis For diagnostic purposes, Southall patients are mostly referred either by general practitioners or from hospital doctors to the Uxbridge Chest Clinic, and if tuberculosis is found treatment and following-up is instituted from that Clinic. The Tuberculosis Visitor calls at the home of a patient and submits a copy of her report to the Public Health Department. Contacts are seen by the Visitor and they have suitable tests, either tuberculin tests or X-rays, or both, at the Chest Clinic. If sanitary defects or overcrowding are reported further visiting is carried out from the Public Health Department. At St. Bernard's Hospital, cases of tuberculosis are isolated in Adelaide Ward, which has 24 male and 24 female beds. One of the doctors from Uxbridge Chest Clinic continues to carry out tuberculin testing and B.C.G. vaccination of members of the nursing staff of the hospital. B.C.G. Vaccination B.C.G. vaccination is offered to contacts of cases of tuberculosis, to medical and nursing staffs of tuberculosis wards, and since 1957, as a result of the findings of the Medical Research Council in their Tuberculosis Vaccines Clinical Trial, to children aged 13 and over in Southall schools. Testing with tuberculin is carried out beforehand. The tuberculin test, if positive, shows that infection has occurred at some time during life, and further investigation is undertaken to verify whether this is active, chronic or healed infection, as these all give the same result to the test. When the tuberculin test is negative and in the absence of disease, B.C.G. inoculations are carried out in order to render the individuals tuberculin positive and, therefore, to have immunity to infection by the tuberculous bacillus. The number of children who received B.C.G. through the Chest Clinic was in total 97 during 1959, and the details are as follows:— New born babies 5 Children under 1 year 20 Children 1-4 years18 Children 5-15 years 37 Over 15 years 17 97 Under the B.C.G. vaccination in schools scheme, details are as follows:— Number invited to take part in the scheme Number of consents received Referred to Chest Clinic Number of children vaccinated with B.C.G. Contacts Positives 482 338 3 45 228 All testing and vaccinating during 1959 under this scheme was carried out in Southall by the Medical Research Council's staff. Tuberculosis Vaccines Clinical Trial During 1959 the Medical Research Council's Vaccines Trial continued in Southall and in September, 1959, the second progress report of the investigation was published. This report showed that B.C.G. vaccination confers a very substantial protection against tuberculosis which persists for at least 7½ years after being given. Vaccination of school children will, therefore, contribute very substantially to the reduction of tuberculosis in adolescents and young adults. This assessment of the potentialities of B.C.G. vaccine has 19 been made possible by the close co-operation of the many local health authorities throughout the country. The work has involved the home visiting and X-raying of large numbers of participants. In 1959 the Medical Research Council X-ray Unit visited Brentford Health Centre and 41 out of the 48 Trial participants living in Southall were invited to attend; of these 30 kept their X-ray appointment. In view of the duration of the investigation which has been going on since 1950, the proportion of participants who continue to attend for X-ray is highly satisfactory. It is expected that the Trial will continue in its present form until August, 1960, and the final visit to Brentford will be paid in the week beginning Tuesday, 26th April. At this visit it is hoped to X-ray as many as possible of the participants still living in the area. Research into Incidence of New Tuberculosis in the Adolescent In previous reports this piece of research has been described, the purpose of it being to ascertain the amount of tuberculosis occurring during the first years in industry or office life of young persons. This is now the seventh year of the experiment and up to date no active cases have been found amongst adolescents taking part in the investigation in Southall. 516 ex-school leavers were tested during the visit of the Mass X-ray Unit into the Borough. During the year a visit was made to Southall by the Mobile Mass X-ray Unit, and three small groups of people were X-rayed including the group of ex-school leavers already reported above. From the others, totalling 362, two positive cases were found. Mass X-ray There is now available at the West Middlesex Hospital a static Mass X-ray Unit, the second to be introduced in Middlesex, and while primarily intended for the use of hospital patients, there is an open invitation for any member of the public to attend at any time when the Unit is working, for a check. This is a most useful undertaking and supplements the work done during the visits of the Mobile Unit to Southall. It also saves the need, in most cases, of reference by appointment to the Chest X-ray Clinic for a large film to be taken. Dr. J. T. Nicol Roe, Chest Physician, Uxbridge Chest Clinic, reports that, in spite of the steady diminution of new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, it still remains a considerable public health problem which must continue to be attacked by all means at our disposal. There is no doubt that treatment is best carried out in hospital, especially in the early stages. The stay in hospital is less than was necessary some years ago. The taking of anti-tuberculous drugs must continue for a few years and it is most important that they are taken conscientiously. The slight deterioration in the Southall figures supports him in this. Dr. Nicol Roe also states that the need for the X-ray and tuberculin testing in Indian immigrants continues and urges that efforts should be made to encourage a visit to the Chest Clinic by every new Indian resident in Southall. It is important also that those found to be tuberculin negative should return for B.C.G. vaccination, and in support of this he submits the following figures, which refer only to Indians sent to the Clinic by their general practitioners. Under 1 year 1-4 5-15 Over 15 Total Tested - - 5 119 124 Negative - 1 4 13 18 Positive - - - 80 80 Vaccinated - 1 4 13 18 Of those originally skin tested, 26 failed to return to the Clinic for reading of the test. With regard to prevention and early detection of cases, contacts both at home and factory or workshop should have regular X-rays and/or Tuberculin Tests. Full use should continue to be made of the Mass X-ray Unit's visits to the Borough. 20 Cancer It will be seen by the table of causes of death (page 56) that in 1959 115 cases (65 males and 50 females) died from cancer. See Appendix, Table VI, for an analysis of cancer deaths since 1935. Overleaf is set out in tabular form a classification of the cancer deaths according to the site of the primary growth and in ages. The total number of deaths from cancer in 1959 fell, being 115 as compared with 139 in 1958. Cancer of the lung in males, again the highest individual figure for site of disease, was two less than in 1958. Although the drop in cancer deaths is considerable, there is nothing hopeful to be deduced from this drop as the disease is a slow one, and the figure, though better, is still much higher than figures prior to 1953; these however were exclusive of long stay hospital deaths and by the present methods of registration it is difficult to get the exact figure of Southall residents dying from this disease. Distribution of Infectious Disease Notifications For the incidence of various infectious diseases notified during the year, under age groups and locality, see Appendix, Tables VII and VIII. Infectious Disease Visits During the year, the Public Health Inspectors paid 384 visits with reference to cases of infectious disease. In addition, the County Health Visitors did a certain amount of home and school visiting in connection with infectious diseases. Laboratory Work Specimens taken for bacteriological or chemical investigations, in connection particularly with infectious disease cases, are brought daily to the Manor House and transported to the Ealing Public Health Laboratory. The necessary investigations are carried out and results reported simultaneously to the Medical Officer of Health and to the doctor who has submitted the specimen from one of his patients. Details of the work carried out in 1959 are as follows:— Faeces specimens 419 Sputum specimens 6 Blood specimens 25 Urine specimens 70 Swabs (nose, throat, eye, tongue, ear, rectal and vaginal) 102 Nail scrapings 1 Worm 1 Disinfection In cases of infectious disease, rooms, clothing, etc., were disinfected—rooms by sealing and fumigating with a formalin preparation; clothing, bedding and other infected articles remaining in the room for disinfection. Lists of premises, articles, etc., disinfected during the year:— Rooms 13 Books 120 Beds 13 Eiderdowns 13 Blankets 30 Pillows 29 Sheets 26 21 22 CLASSIFICATION OF CANCER DEATHS IN SITES AND AGES Age Groups—Male Site Total Under 10 10—20 20—30 30—40 40—50 50—60 60—70 70—80 80 + '56 '57 '58 '59 '56 '57 '58 '59 '56 '57 '58 '59 '56 '57 '58 '59 '56 '57 '58 '59 '56 '57 '58 '59 '56 '57 58 '59 '56 '57 '58 '59 '56 '57 '58 '59 '56 '57 '58 '59 Lung 29 24 33 31 - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 3 2 2 1 9 5 12 5 12 13 7 8 5 5 8 7 - 1 1 - Stomach 4 6 16 11 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 4 3 1 3 5 5 2 2 6 5 1 - 1 - Intestine 9 9 13 6 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i 1 - 3 2 2 5 7 2 4 3 2 - - 3 1 1 Bladder i i 3 5 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 2 - - 1 2 i 1 1 1 - - - - Prostate 2 — 2 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 2 - 2 1 - - - 1 Breast - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Other 22 18 22 8 - - - - 1 1 1 - - 1 1 - 3 3 2 - 1 2 1 2 3 2 6 2 3 5 3 3 7 2 7 - 4 2 1 1 Totals 67 58 91 65 - - - - 1 1 1 - - 1 1 - 4 3 5 - 3 2 4 4 12 11 25 24 21 21 25 20 21 13 26 14 5 6 4 3 Age Groups—Female Site Total Under 10 10—20 20—30 30—40 40—50 50—60 60—70 70—80 80 + '56 '57 '58 '59 '56 '57 '58 '59 '56 '57 '58 '59 '56 '57 '58 '59 '56 '57 '58 59 '56 '57 '58 '59 '56 '57 '58 '59 '56 '57 '58 '59 '56 '57 '58 '59 '56 '57 '58 '59 Breast 16 10 10 5 - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 - - - 1 1 - - 2 4 3 1 6 1 - 2 4 4 4 - 2 - 3 2 Lung 5 7 5 5 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 2 - 1 2 2 2 - 1 - - 3 2 1 2 1 - 2 1 - Stomach 8 3 5 9 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 - - - - - 1 4 - 1 2 3 2 2 2 1 - 2 4 Uterus 6 4 1 2 - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 - - - 1 1 - - 1 1 - 1 2 2 1 - 1 - - 1 - - - - Intestine 11 13 8 11 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 3 1 - - 1 2 3 - 3 3 1 3 1 5 3 5 3 2 1 3 Bladder - - - 1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 - - - - Other 19 18 19 17 - - - - - 1 - - - - - 1 - 1 1 - 5 1 1 3 1 5 6 6 7 4 3 4 3 5 4 2 3 1 4 1 Totals 65 55 48 50 - - - - - - - - - - - 1 2 1 1 - 10 7 1 4 7 14 14 9 23 10 6 4 14 17 15 2 9 5 11 10 Smallpox Disinfection In the event of smallpox occurring within the district and disinfection being required on a considerable scale, arrangements have been made whereby this could be carried out. An agreement was made with the North-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board whereby in such an event the staff of St. John's Hospital, Uxbridge, would carry out this work. Provision of Antitoxin and Vaccine Lymph The Council provides diphtheria antitoxin and tetanus antitoxin free to local practitioners in the district. These antitoxins are obtained from the Public Health Department during office hours and by direct request to the Medical Officer of Health at other times. In the event of emergency supplies of vaccine lymph being required, they are obtainable at very short notice. Scabies and Lice During 1959, three cases of infestation with scabies and one contact of a case were brought to the Public Health Department for cleansing. Baths and treatment were arranged at Hammersmith Cleansing Station by courtesy of Hammersmith Borough Council. In addition from one house with multiple occupation, one case was treated and three contacts declared clear by private practitioners. Table XI gives details of head inspections in schools. There seems to be a marked decrease in the amount of work being done for this purpose—as the total figure in 1956 for inspections was 17,245, more than double the number inspected in 1959, i.e. 8,016. In that year, for the total number inspected, 28 were found to be verminous, yet with an inspection of half the number, 23 infections were found, giving no grounds for complacency. 23 WELFARE General St. John Ambulance Association: The local headquarters of the St. John Ambulance Association are situated at Harrington Road, Southall, and the honorary officers are Dr. Mary Ellis, of Lansdowne House, High Street, Harlington, Divisional Surgeon; Miss E. Hobson, 20, Elmfield Road, Southall, Divisional Superintendent, Nursing Division, and Mr. W. Adams, 98, Carlyle Avenue, Southall, Divisional Superintendent, Ambulance Division. There are 21 Nursing Members and 16 Auxiliary Members. The work carried out is as follows:— Home Nursing and Nursing Equipment. The St. John Ambulance Nursing Division has been trained in Home Nursing and First Aid to the Injured. It also lends Nursing equipment for use in the home from the Medical Comforts Depot in Harrington Road, open every evening (except Sundays and Bank Holidays) from 7.30 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. for the issue of articles needed by the public. During the year 433 articles were lent under the scheme—the 1958 figure was 489. Welfare—General. The St. John Ambulance Brigade carried out trainings in First Aid and Home Nursing for all who cared to take advantage of the service, also special courses for Civil Defence Volunteers and for Scouts and Guides. The members of the Nursing and Ambulance Divisions carried out many other duties including attendance at local cinemas, sports, fairs, Old Folks' Clubs, accompanying old people's group excursions to the seaside, Hospital duties, also Sick Visiting. Members also took part in duties further afield, including London Airport, London theatres, concerts, etc. British Red Cross Society: The Southall Division of the British Red Cross Society made steady progress in 1959, and membership increased to 125. The Girls' Cadet unit attracted many more members, and courses of First Aid and Nursing were well attended, with satisfactory examination results. A "New Members" Group was registered in 1959, and valuable work and discussions took place at the monthly meetings of these ordinary members, whose duties are mainly non-medical ones. The Disabled People's Handcraft Club brought much pleasure to the house-bound members who attended weekly at St. George's Hall, to which the meeting was transferred —in order to have increased space. The main activities in the Borough are:— Instruction and Examinations in First Aid and Home Nursing. Welfare visiting. Medical Loan Depot. Nursing in the Home. Escort duties to and from Hospitals and holiday homes. Transport for the sick. Clerical work and other duties connected with the National Blood Transfusion Service. Handcraft Qub for the Disabled. After-care and emergency help for disabled exservicemen. Club for Disabled Persons: A Club, for persons suffering from severe disablement, met weekly and was a social and recreational one for people suffering from any physical handicap. Transport was provided by members of the Rotary Club and Round Table for those members who were 24 unable to make their own way to the Club premises, which were at the Southall Community Centre. The membership rose during 1959 to a figure of 26—the average attendance being 18. Members make themselves useful to the Community Centre staff in little ways, and this is of considerable therapeutic value. The Hard of Hearing Club: This Club, which was inaugurated in 1955, continues to be popular and useful to its members, who number about 40. The Committee is very energetic and the programmes arranged for the members were varied, interesting and often directly useful in helping them to come to terms with their disability. The meetings throughout the year were well attended and although the summer was a prolonged one the attendance at group meetings was excellent. The Welfare Committee of the Southall Group had numerous calls for services— assistance was given for all who needed such service. It is felt that there are many more of the residents in the Borough who are hard of hearing or severely deafened who could be helped if they were aware of the facilities provided by the League. Two members attended the Old Age Pensioners' Holiday at Margate organised by the Welfare Committee of the Middlesex & Surrey League. A party of eleven attended the Southern Area Rally at Clacton organised by the British Association of the Hard of Hearing. One new subject developed in 1959 was "Clear Speech" and members are being encouraged to develop their speech, which may often be difficult due to the fact that the severely deafened person cannot hear his own voice. A Southall member won the West Middlesex Area championship of Clear Speech in 1959. Inter-group activities in the West Middlesex Area have been taking place, giving an expansion of interests, companionship, and cultural activity to the Group. Diabetic Club: The Club for Diabetics, started in 1956, continued to function throughout 1959. This Club was founded to enable sufferers from diabetes as well as those interested in diabetes, i.e. for relatives or friends of diabetics, to meet together socially and to have the opportunity to discuss their individual problems with fellow sufferers and to hear authoritative talks from speakers particularly interested in diabetes such as doctors and other nutrition and health experts. The membership was 35 and the attendance at monthly meetings averaged about 24 but altogether some 130 diabetics have enjoyed the benefits of the club since its formation. Home Advice Group: This Group, created for the purpose of assisting and advising mothers with problems, continued to function throughout the year. Meetings were held weekly at the Work Centre for the Elderly in the Municipal Sports Ground. A programme of interesting discussions, demonstrations and specialist speakers was carried out during the year. The Group is assisted financially by the Housing Committee of the Borough Council and is under the direction of a Co-ordinating Committee of officials of the various bodies concerned with welfare of the family. The membership increased to 21 by the end of the year, with an average attendance of 15. Welfare of the Blind and Partially Sighted: The welfare services for blind and partially-sighted are the responsibility of the County Council under the National Assistance Act, 1948. The County Council's Welfare Department provides a Home Teaching service, the object of which is to enable blind and partially-sighted people to lead as full and active lives as their handicap allows, by assisting them in overcoming the effects of their disabilities. 25 The Home Teachers visit all blind and partially-sighted persons in their own homes, hospitals and residential homes, advise on all problems relating to their welfare and keep them in touch with available social services. Instruction is given in Braille and Moon systems of raised type, in handcrafts and where appropriate, in the Deaf-Blind manual alphabet. A handcraft class is held fortnightly at the King's Hall Methodist Church, South Road, Southall. Close co-operation is maintained between the County Council and Voluntary Organisations including the Social Club for the Blind, which holds fortnightly meetings at the Labour Hall, The Broadway, Southall, and the Middlesex Association for the Blind who maintain a holiday home at Littlehampton, two Residential Homes for the Blind, and assist individual necessitous blind people. Blind persons are eligible for the loan of a wireless receiver through the British Wireless for the Blind Fund, and the County Council has a scheme for assisting blind and partiallysighted persons with the maintenance of wireless sets. Other services are provided by the County Council either directly or through a registered agency and these include facilities for the placement of blind persons in employment, courses of residential rehabilitation, training courses for mothers with blind babies, the supply of embossed literature, special equipment and handcraft materials, assistance in the disposal of handcrafts and assisted holidays for those in need. In 1959, there were resident in the Borough 101 blind and 15 partially-sighted persons. One blind person was training, and xo were in full-time employment. Of these one was in a Workshop for the Blind, and one was working as a Home Worker. Those employed in Workshops or as Home Workers had their earnings augmented by the County Council. The majority of blind persons are not available for, or not capable of, training and employment owing to age or some other reason. Welfare of Handicapped Persons other than Blind: Schemes for the welfare of handicapped persons other than blind and partially-sighted which are operated by the County Council's Welfare Department under the National Assistance Act, 1948, provide welfare services for the deaf and dumb and hard of hearing, and other persons who are substantially and permanently handicapped by disease, injury, or congenital deformity. Services to the deaf and dumb and the hard of hearing are provided by appropriate Voluntary Organisations, to whom the County Council makes grants in aid. The Borough of Southall forms part of Area 9 which includes also the Boroughs of Brentford & Chiswick and Heston & Isleworth. Two Welfare Visitors and a Homework Organiser are included in the staff which has been provided by the County Council's Welfare Department for carrying out the social services required and who visit those suffering from substantial and permanent handicaps. They work from the local Area Welfare Office and the handicapped persons are visited in their own homes with a view to assisting them to obtain services from statutory or voluntary sources (or both). The County Council supplies aids and appliances not covered by the National Health Service, carries out where necessary adaptations to a house to enable a handicapped person to become more mobile, provides holidays, arranges for the disabled to take part in social activities, attend handcraft classes, etc. Advice and guidance regarding personal problems are given and membership of voluntary organisations catering for particular handicaps is facilitated. The Home Work Organiser endeavours to procure from Industry appropriate assembly work and arranges for this to be carried out by handicapped persons where this is considered to be suitable and of assistance to the individuals concerned. Residents of the Borough needing any of the County Welfare Services briefly referred to in this Report should apply to the Area Welfare Officer, at the Local County Offices, Great West Road, Brentford. 26 Nutrition of school children: For many years mid-morning milk and meals for school children have been provided in Southall state schools. This is a most important welfare provision, particularly as the mid-day dinners are designed carefully to supply an adequate balanced meal once a day. The value of these provisions is particularly great for children who have to travel some distance to school as it prevents the hurried consumption and digestion of food, when a considerable part of the meal break has to be spent in going to and from school, and there is no doubt that children very often are least difficult about food when they eat communally. Provided school canteens are well maintained and great care is taken over the handling of the food there is undoubted benefit to be obtained from the school meals service. It is interesting to see from figures kindly supplied by the Divisional Education Officer the details of milk and meals acceptance in the various schools in the Borough. One fact which can be picked out from these figures is not a good one, i.e. the milk consumption at the Grammar School where the pupils are at an age when extra milk is most important to them is only 41% and although the meals consumption is better at 51% is it still not good for a school in which the pupils are working hard, both physically and mentally, during the period that their growth and development is probably at the highest peak of their whole lives. The percentage of children having milk in schools is as follows:— Primary 97% Secondary Modern 85% Technical 83.3% Grammar 41.1% Talbot Special 92.5% The percentages of meals served to daily attendances:— %of Attendance taking meals Autumn Term 1959 Average Attendance Average Number taking meals Primary Schools: Beaconsfield Road Junior Mixed 45 104 229 Beaconsfield Road Infants' 47 76 163 Clifton Road Junior Mixed 36 65 183 Clifton Road Infants' 35 36 103 Dormers Wells J.M 59 133 226 Dormers Wells Infants' 55 85 154 Featherstone Road J.M. 32 95 296 Featherstone Road Infants' 36 80 220 George Tomlinson J.M. 56 145 258 George Tomlinson Infants' 50 57 115 Lady Margaret J.M. 49 171 350 Lady Margaret Infants' 43 90 210 North Road J.M. and Infants' 51 188 366 St. Anselm's R.C. 70 251 360 Tudor Road J.M. 38 136 360 Tudor Road Infants' 29 65 221 Secondary Schools: Southall Grammar 51 336 662 Dormers Wells Boys' 39 226 581 Dormers Wells Girls' 48 288 595 Featherstone Road Boys' 39 223 577 Western Road Girls' 42 188 445 Technical 36 147 404 Special Schools: Talbot Road 99 202 204 27 Old People The needs of 13 special cases of old people living in difficult circumstances were investigated during 1959, and what happened to them is recorded in the following list:— Admitted to hospital 2 Admitted to old people's home 2 Remaining at home 9 (a) Home Help provided 2 (b) Home Help and District Nurse provided 1 (c) Home Help, District Nurse, and Meals provided 1 (id) Social problem eased 1 (e) Awaiting housing for old people 1 (/) Holiday arranged 1 (,g) Rehoused 1 (h) No action 1 The difficulties of the old persons recorded on this list were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department staff either by medical practitioners, interested relations, neighbours or friends, or following complaint by one or other of the statutory authorities. The County Council has the duty, under the National Assistance Act, 1948, of providing residential accommodation for aged and infirm persons in need of care and attention which is not otherwise available to them; and it can do this by providing its own Homes or by arrangements with recognised Voluntary Organisations. The County Council's Welfare Department administers the County Homes, and the number of persons admitted to such homes from the Borough in 1959 was 20. It has been ascertained from the Area Medical Officer that 389 Southall people were given Home Help during the year and of these 333 consisted of chronic sick or aged persons, a figure which has risen by 16% over the 1958 figure, and of 734 persons who were assisted by the Home Nurses, 402 were of age 65 or over. Many voluntary associations contributed to provide Christmas parcels or special comforts for old people. Meals on Wheels Service: During the year mid-day meals on four days per week were provided for house-bound old people in need of the service. In 1959, 8,860 meals were delivered, an increase of 904 over the 1958 figure. The maximum number of old people receiving the meals on any one day was 47. The number of people who can be helped in this way is too small for the needs of the Borough, and negotiations were in progress during 1959 for the provision of another van, by the use of which the service could be doubled. The cost of the meal was 9d. to the recipient, and for each meal Southall Borough Council made a grant of 1/6. Meals were obtained from the School Canteens and conveyed in a van owned by the Southall Old People's Welfare Association. Chiropody Service for Old People: This service was continued throughout 1959. Five local chiropodists gave their services at cheap rates for Old Age Pensioners. 28 Holidays for Old People: The holiday scheme whereby old people get a seaside holiday during off season months of May and September, at reduced rates, continued during 1959 and was operated by the various Old People's Clubs in the Borough. In celebration of the 25th anniversary of the granting of a Borough Charter to Southall, the Southall Old People's Welfare Association operated a special holiday provision paid for by the Council whereby 50 old age pensioners were given a free holiday for one week, the Association itself providing the travellers with spending money and comforts. Other Services: A service for the provision of cheap laundry and a cheap boot and shoe service are available. The North Thames Gas Board offers a free service of inspection of the gas appliances and service pipes in houses of old age pensioners living alone. The reason for this is to reduce the risk of gas poisoning, a frequent cause of home accidents and fatalities in old people. The offer includes free replacement of faulty pipes and the free repair of faulty appliances. To take advantage of this offer, lists of old people living alone are submitted from the Public Health Department and in due course the homes of the persons nominated on the lists are visited by the Gas Board officers. Fresh lists continued to be supplied from time to time. Southall Association for the Occupation of the Elderly: The Work Centre for the Elderly situated in the Municipal Sports Ground, and maintained by a voluntary association supported in part by Middlesex County Council and Southall Borough Council, continued to operate throughout 1959. Various types of simple work were carried out by the old people in quite a satisfactory way, indeed as the firms supplying the work were expected to pay the proper rate for work, it was essential that the work should be completed to their satisfaction. The number of workers had risen by the end of the year to 50, and various types of work were carried out, carding buttons, sorting mixed metallic wastes from a large engineering company, trimming and stamping of metal bolts, trimming of rubber, assembly of ball point pens, etc., and the old people could be put on the jobs which were most suited to their capabilities. Any old age pensioner is eligible to apply for work under this Scheme and once taken on is kept on whether his or her output can be considered significant or not. It is realised by the workers that a flat rate of 10/- per week for a ten hour week is certainly much less than the younger healthy pensioner would be able to obtain in the labour market, but they also realise that as they grow older or ill and less able to do very much work this wage will continue the same. The scheme can never become self-supporting, but it is showing great benefits in the social and even physical well-being of the people who are working. There is a very happy atmosphere in the work rooms. Tea-making facilities are available at the Work Centre and during the year new Rest Room Furniture and Equipment were purchased and installed, from money obtained by public appeal. The Public Library Staff arranged to maintain a small selection of books at the Centre. National Assistance Act, 1948, Section 47: National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951: No case was dealt with under these powers during 1959. 29 HEALTH EDUCATION The education of the public in matters of health and hygiene is one of the most important functions of the Public Health Department and never ceases, as every visit paid by an Inspector is accompanied by some form of explanation of the advantages of hygienic living, i.e. if the Inspector is called to a food shop he will give reasons as to why it is undesirable for food handlers to be passing germs on to the food from their hands or from breathing, and if he visits on a housing defect, in conversation he is certain to talk about some danger to public health. Talks are given to local organisations, sometimes on the request of the organisation, sometimes at the suggestion of the departmental staff. The Council maintains close relations with the Central Council for Health Education, so that information is always available of new methods of publicity and new publicity material. Poster, leaflet and book-mark propaganda, while effective if carried out on a considerable scale, must be constantly changed as the eye wearies and the mind closes if the same prohibition or wording is uttered too frequently. During 1959, revolving lamps carrying pictorial shades with various slogans to remind the public of health hazards, were purchased and displayed in various Corporation departments. There was an increase in the amount of publicity given to safety in the home, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents in 1959 made a considerable feature of health education on this subject. Following on the "Guard that Fire" campaign, which had been instituted by this Society during 1958, the new slogan was "Guard that Child" and various aspects of care in the home for young children were emphasised in the poster and newspaper publicity during various months of the year. DEATHS FROM ACCIDENT The number who died as a result of accident other than motor vehicle accident appeared to rise again, being 18 in 1959, as compared with 14 in 1958 and 9 in 1957. Five of the accidental deaths, however, occurred as the result of an aircraft falling on houses in Southall in September, 1958; the deaths, although occurring then, did not appear in the Registrar's figures until the findings of the Official Inquiry in 1959. This alters the true 1958 figure to 19, and the true 1959 figure to 13. Three of the accidental deaths were the result of accident in the home, and two happened in Hospital. Five elderly persons died from the consequences of falls, three at home, and two in Hospital. Five persons were found drowned; one died from barbiturate poisoning; one died from injuries at work, and one following anaesthetic administration. 30 ROAD SAFETY The number of motor vehicle accidents occurring within the Borough of Southall was a little greater in 1959 than in 1958. The number of fatalities was the same. Five persons, none of whom were children, were killed in street accidents. Details are as follows:— Persons Killed Type of Road User Cause of Accident Age Sex Private motor car driver Motor car travelling east fails to take left-hand bend in road, mounts footway and collides with concrete bridge parapet 35 M Pedestrian Male pedestrian walks into the side of a passing heavy goods lorry 35 M Private motor car driver Apparently the driver of the first vehicle was travelling west along The Broadway when he collapsed at the wheel and swerved to his right and collided with a motor scooter, a motor cycle combination and a private motor car all travelling east along The Broadway 40 M Pedal cyclist Pedal cyclist travelling west is struck at rear by a trolley bus also travelling west 50 M Public service vehicle passenger Vehicle travelling south and turning right. Passenger steps off platform into path of solo motor cycle travelling south and is struck 65 M Persons Injured Adult School Age Under 5 Seriousi Slight Serious Slight Serious Slight Pedestrians 17 2q 2 23 _ 2 Total 46 Total 25 Total 2 Pedal cyclists 14 67 1 20 Nil Total 81 Total 21 Nil P.M.C. drivers 2 22 Total 24 P.M.C. passengers 8 25 1 1 - 1 Total 33 Total 2 Total 1 Motor cyclists (including scooters and Mopeds) 18 104 Total 122 Drivers of other vehicles 2 15 Total 17 Passengers in other vehicles 1 30 1 3 Total 31 Total 4 Donkey rider 1 Adult Total 354 Children Total 56 Fatalities Adult Total 5 Children Total - Although there were no children killed the number of children injured on the roads was still high, just four less in number than in 1958. The Road Safety Committee of the Borough Council maintained a full programme of education in road safety in which the Metropolitan Police took an active part. The Southall school children received constant training and exhortation on the use of roads. Of the five dying as a result of motor accidents in Southall one was a Southall resident; two other Southall residents died as a result of motor accidents received when they were away from home. 31 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BOROUGH Water Supply and Water Services Water is supplied to nearly the whole of the district by the South-West Suburban Water Company. The Metropolitan Water Board supplies a small area in the southern part of the district, and the Rickmansworth & Uxbridge Valley Water Company a small area in the northern part. The supply is satisfactory, both in quality and quantity. Reports on sampling carried out by the Metropolitan Water Board are issued from time to time. All inhabited houses are supplied from public water mains and there are no standpipes in use on mains. Under Section 35, Middlesex County Council Act, 1956, provision is made for immediate action to be taken by the Local Authority to restore a water supply which has been cut off for some default. Two samples of factory drinking water were taken by Departmental staff and found to be satisfactory. In addition 19 samples of artesian well water (from factories situated in the Borough) were taken, all of which were sterile and pure. Samples taken from the Artesian well supplying drinking water at St. Bernard's Hospital gave unsatisfactory results and, following visits from the engineer of the Regional Hospital Board, the use of this water for drinking was discontinued, and South West Suburban Water Company's mains supply substituted. Sewerage Middlesex County Council provides the facilities for purification of sewage from the Borough at the Mogden Sewage Works. The amount of congestion occurring in the drains and sewers of the Borough, partly as a result of increase in the number of houses and shops and partly due to the fact that improved knowledge of hygiene results in an increased use of water for cleanliness, meant that problems have arisen of overcharging of sewers, and of flooding during periods of heavy rain. Measures to relieve this have had to be taken, and the latest position with regard to these improvements is as follows:— The construction of the Tentelow Lane Outfall Sewer was completed during 1959. This outfall sewer discharges into the water course which forms the southern boundary of the Borough, and thence into the River Brent, taking the surface water from the Havelock Road housing estate which formerly was discharged into the Canal. It will also be able to take surface water from the surface water sewers which are being provided in the parts of Tentelow Lane not previously drained. A soil sewer has been provided for the drainage of houses in Glade Lane and at the eastern end of Havelock Road. By the end of the year these properties which had no main drainage facilities were rapidly being connected to this public sewer. Prior to this it was necessary to maintain a thrice weekly pail closet collection of night soil. It was possible also to get rid of three systems of cesspool drainage by the construction of this sewer. Further progress was made during the year by the Council consultants on the preparation of the outline scheme for the southern soil relief sewer to relieve surcharging in the area of the Borough bounded by King Street and The Green in the East, the Railway in the North and the Canal in the South. This sewer will also improve conditions in Norwood Road and Tentelow Lane. Progress has also been made on the preparation of a scheme for the southern surface water relief sewer, to give assistance to the surface water system already in operation, and to take surcharge in the southern part of the Borough. Shortage of staff in the Borough Engineer's Department prevented the amount of progress which was expected with regard to this scheme. Serious flooding of the Yeading Brook in the area of the houses in Delamere Road and certain streets in Hayes, was improved in 1959 by the re-alignment of the River Crane by the Middlesex County Council's contractors. The River Crane was also widened, dredged and deepened in certain places. 32 Collection by gully emptier from: 2 cesspools at factories remote from main sewage system; 6 pails at Bulls Bridge; 2 pails at Carlyle Avenue; cesspool at Springdale; two cesspools at Glade Lane Cottages (now connected to sewer); one cesspool at The Aviary; one cesspool at Wycombe Cafe (now connected to sewer). Sanitary Inspections of the District The total number of inspections of premises made during the year by the Public Health Inspectors was 8,630. Table XII gives an analysis of the number and nature of such inspections. The number of inspections again increased, being 1,804 more than in 1958, evidence of the need for the full complement of inspectors, which was obtained at last after years of shortage. There was again a rise in the figure for inspections of houses under the Housing and Rent Acts. Some of the increase was due to inspections for Certificates of Disrepair permitted to be granted before increases of rent could be obtained by landlords of properties. There was an increase also in the number of inspections of properties for which Improvement Grant was claimed, and a certain amount of house-to-house visiting to bring the housing records a little more up-to-date was carried out when possible. In former years, inspections and the taking of observations for nuisance from smoke, have been classified in Table XII under the headings "Atmospheric Pollution" and " Smoke Observations," but with the new and very much increased house-to-house visiting connected with the improvement of atmospheric pollution by the operations of the Clean Air Act, 1956, visits specifically connected with the making of a Smoke Control Order have been separated in the table from smoke observations made because of nuisance alleged to be caused by industrial premises, and the figure for these Clean Air Act inspections has risen to 1,708 compared with 309 in 1958. Market There is a market, part open, part covered, in the High Street where a weekly horse and cattle sale was held on Wednesdays and a general sale of market produce and goods was held on Saturdays. Special attention was paid regularly to the hygienic provisions and maintenance there. Some disturbance of amenity was caused to tenants of adjacent houses by the delayed collection of livestock on a few occasions. In addition, travelling fairs and circuses spend periods in the Borough, three to four times a year, and require supervision. School Sanitation, Ventilation and Lighting Schools were re-inspected during the year. Certain re-planning was requested for increased sanitary facilities to comply with modern standards of hygiene. With regard to the disposal of school refuse, the Council assist to the maximum degree by providing the required number of bins on request. Improved sanitation was provided in Featherstone Road Junior Mixed School in 1959 by the construction (for the boys' section) of a new sanitary block consisting of 6 waterclosets, 12 handbasins, 1 urinal, 1 staff watercloset. An internal drinking fountain was also provided. At Beaconsfield Road Junior School, 10 faulty washbasins were replaced. At Western Road Girls' School the amount of artificial lighting was increased by 50% in 13 rooms and by 33% in one room. 33 Eradication of Bed Bugs Statistics for the year:— (a) Number of Council houses (1) found to be infested 4 (2) disinfested during the year 4 (b) Number of other houses (1) found to be infested 10 (2) disinfested during the year 10, Total 14 Canal Boats Southall is not a registration authority for Canal Boats. The routine inspections carried out by neighbouring authorities having boat docks, reduce this work to a minimum and no report on any particular boat was necessary. Mortuary and Post-Mortem Room The mortuary, situated in Havelock Road, provides adequate accommodation for the Borough. No bodies were deposited in the mortuary during the year. Two hundred and four bodies were deposited in the mortuary at Acton for post-mortem purposes and coroner's inquest if necessary. Factories Act, 1937 The following tables give details of the work done in connection with the factories and outworkers in the Borough:— Inspections Factory Premises Number on Register Number of Inspections Written Notices Occupiers Prosecuted (i) Factories in which Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are to be enforced by Local Authorities 17 10 - - (ii) Factories not included in (i) in which Section 7 is enforced by the Local Authority 162 127 3 - (iii) Other Premises in which Section 7 is enforced by the Local Authority (excluding outworkers' premises) - - - - Totals 179 137 3 34 Defects Found Particulars Number of cases in which defects were found Found Remedied Referred Number of cases in which Prosecutions were instituted To H.M.

Premises where upholstery is reconditioned and secondhand articles sold are included in the list of general inspections. 35 HOUSING Of the 83 houses recommended for slum clearance in the provisional programme for the years 1955 to i960, the majority are now either demolished or under sentence of demolition as soon as all occupying families have been housed. Properties already dealt with on the list submitted to the Ministry of Health are :— Numbers 1 and 2, Bells Cottages and 1 to 6, Pluckington Place Numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4, Killarney Cottages Numbers 5 to 18, Featherstone Terrace Numbers 2 to 4 and 18 to 28, Spencer Street Numbers 6 to 16, Spencer Street Numbers 9 to 15, The Crescent Demolished 55 Dagmar Cottage Allowed to remain provided no human habitation 1 One cottage was brought up to suitable standard by the owner and is still inhabited. An offer to modernise five of the houses in the schedule was made and accepted by the Borough Council. Improvement Grants (Housing Act, 1949, as amended by the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958) Thirty applications were received and twenty-eight were approved for grant for property improvement. The improvements in standards of housing resulting from the use of this type of grant and from the repair conditions by which increased rents can be obtained under the Rent Act, 1957, make a useful although not extensive advance in the attainment of good environmental conditions for healthy living, and the figure rose greatly—only 3 in 1958 were received; all were approved. Certificates of Disrepair (Rent Act, 1957) During the year 24 applications have been received, 23 proposals to issue Certificates were approved. Two certificates were issued and 8 certificates cancelled. Cancellation and issue are not necessarily related. Where Undertakings are given by landlord to carry out the required repairs no certificate is issued. Overcrowding There was again an increase in the number of visits paid for estimation of overcrowding to the Public Health Department. Twenty-five cases of new overcrowding were confirmed in 1959. Forty cases of overcrowding were relieved during the year—this figure was 26 in 1958. The number remaining on the Department's register of overcrowding at the end of the year was 48 dwellings. For further detail see Table XIII, page 62. Rehousing of Applicants for Council Dwellings Council Housing within the Borough Total number of families obtaining Council accommodation for the first time in 1959 was 72. Three were from slum clearance areas, 22 from requisitioned properties, 26 from other accommodation. Twenty-one were moved into old people's dwellings. New Town Housing The total number of families removing to New or Expanded Towns: 25 families nominated under the Industrial Selection Scheme up to April, 1956, since when the Council has had to pay subsidy for every family moving from this Borough to New or Expanded 36 Towns. The total number of families who have moved to New or Expanded Towns since that data is a further 186, eighteen families having been rehoused in this way during 1959. There were 426 houses, built between 1930 and 1936, which still had old ranges with hot water supply, except where the tenants themselves installed modern fireplaces. 64 of these ranges were replaced by the Council during 1959, making a total of 163 modernised up to the 31st December, 1959. The last of the Council houses built with gas lighting were modernised by early 1959. All the 349 houses built before 1929 have now been wired for electricity, and are equipped with modern fireplaces, hot water supply and lavatory basins. Houses Let in Lodgings There are 180 houses let in lodgings, owned and occupied mainly by Indians. Their sub-tenants are West Africans and Irish. Section 90 of the Housing Act, 1957, is applied to each of these houses so that owners shall know as soon as possible "what is in the authority's opinion the maximum number of persons by whom it is suitable to be occupied." The Public Health Act, 1936, has on occasion to be used for the repair and cleansing of waterclosets and accumulations of rubbish. A fair amount of time is spent in raising hygiene standards of these new residents, but a great deal more time will be needed. Middlesex County Council Act, 1944—Section 345 The caravan site at the junction of Regina Road and Pluckington Place continues to be used as the winter quarters of a member of The Showmen's Guild. One family still occupies a caravan near the Grand Union Canal, at Bull's Bridge. New Housing The following details have been supplied by the Borough Engineer, outlining the complete amount of house building for Southall since the end of the war. Built by Southall Borough Council During the Year 1959 Since the end of the War (including 1959) Within the Borough Outside the Borough Within the Borough Outside the Borough Old People's Dwellings 36 — 83 — Houses (Maisonettes) 14 — 324 136 Flats — — 390 132 Prefabricated Houses - - 299 - In 1959, fifteen of the temporary prefabricated bungalows were demolished and the tenants transferred to permanent housing.

Nine of these were not confirmed bacteriologically, and of the ten confirmed, eight had been infected with Salmonella Typhi Murium and two with the organisms Salmonella St. Paul. In addition, two notified as dysentery and two notified as enteritis were subsequently confirmed as having been infected with Salmonella Thompson and Salmonella Typhi Murium respectively, and therefore, are included as confirmed cases of food poisoning. One case of suspected food poisoning was confirmed as Salmonella Typhi Murium. The total number of confirmed cases was fifteen. The cases were widely spread and although various items of food were suspected and some investigated no agent of infection was found in any of the cases. In one instance two members of the same family were infected with Salmonella St. Paul and in one instance two members of the same household were infected with Salmonella Typhi Murium and one with Salmonella Thompson. Personal Hygiene The free washing facilities in the public conveniences, which were brought into operation in September, 1950, continued to be available throughout 1959. During that period 8,500 paper towels were issued free, and also 4,081 linen towels, which were provided at a cost of 2d. per person. Milk The following licences under the Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949 and 1950, and Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 and 1950 were issued:— for the sale of Tuberculin Tested Milk 22 for the sale of Pasteurised Milk 26 for the sale of Sterilised Milk 25 Supplementary Licences 18 91 Ice Cream The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1947-1952. As there were no manufacturers in the Borough, temperature control observations, as laid down in these Regulations, were not required. Routine work was carried out under Article 4 of the 1947 Regulations to check the conservation of ice-cream in cinemas. Food Sampling The bacteriological analyses of 249 food samples, taken during the year, were carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service. 197 of these specimens were ice-cream samples, covefing 9 makes of ice-cream, and following bacteriological analyses the ice-creams were graded as follows:— Excellent 113 Satisfactory 60 Doubtful 8 Unsatisfactory 7 38 The freezer was out of order at the Laboratory for one week during the year, and consequently nine samples of ice cream were submitted but results were not available. Forty-six samples were taken of Imitation Cream. The results of these were all satisfactory. Other samples taken:— Result Sausage Meat Coliforms—faecal and non-faecal Pork Sausage Meat Satisfactory Sausages Coliforms—faecal and non-faecal Bacon No pathogenic organisms Dripping Satisfactory Corned Beef Satisfactory Satisfactory communication has been maintained during the year with the County Public Control Department, and the report on the work carried out in Southall by the staff of that Department is as follows:— Article Total Samples Procured Unsatisfactory Milk (new) 43 13 Milk (various) 58 - Butter 15 — Cakes 5 2 Cooked Meat 5 — Cream 9 — Drugs 6 — Fish and Fish Products 12 — Fruit, Fresh and Canned 5 — Ice Cream 19 — Liver 3 — Margarine 3 — Meat and Meat Products 21 — Preserves 6 — Sausages, etc 3 — Sweets 3 1 Vinegar and Non-Brewed Condiment 15 Miscellaneous 13 2 244 18 Milk (New). Two consignments of new milk delivered to milk depots in this district were found to include churns of milk deficient in solids-not-fat. There was no evidence of added water and the low solids-not-fat found were probably due to a natural diet deficiency. Subsequent samples were satisfactory and no further action was taken. Cakes. One retailer was found to have Vanilla Slices for sale marked "Cream Slices." The ticket was written and affixed by a part-time assistant contrary to the firm's instructions. An official caution was given for this offence. Another retailer was responsible for selling a Fruit Pie which was found to contain a nail. Exhaustive investigation failed to establish how it had got into the pie, and it was decided to send an official caution to the manufacturer. 39 Confectionery. Some sweets displayed as "Rum Truffles" were purchased from a retail shop. These should have been labelled "Rum Flavour Truffles." Printed tickets had been supplied with the word "Flavour" omitted, and as a temporary measure these were being used. The assistants had been instructed to write in the word " Flavour," which had not been done in this instance. The matter was dealt with by the sending of an official caution. Miscellaneous. A bottle of Olive Oil was sold by a retailer, the bottle not being marked with the name or address of the packer or labeller. This omission was rectified and a letter of caution sent. A packet of Bisto submitted by a purchaser was found to contain some green wax. Enquiries produced no conclusive result as it was not possible to establish at what stage the wax had got into the packet. No further action was taken in this case. Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1953. The majority of the inspection work carried out under the provisions of these Acts is to ensure compliance with the requirements of the various Marking Orders made under the provisions of the Act of 1926. These Orders apply to the marking of the country of origin on imported foodstuffs, principally meat, apples, tomatoes, dried fruits, bacon, ham, poultry, butter and honey, upon sale and exposure for sale. The inspections were made at 152 premises of 347 displays of these foodstuffs, and no infringements were detected. Labelling of Food Order, 1953. This Order requires pre-packed food to be marked with the name and address, or with the registered trade mark of the packer or labeller. It also requires such food to be labelled with its common or usual name (if any), and in the case of a compounded food with the names of the ingredients in descending order of proportion by weight. It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed and prescribes specific labelling of certain foods. A total of 208 articles of prepacked food was examined at 107 different premises, and apart from the Olive Oil item previously mentioned in this report, satisfactory compliance with the terms of the Order was noted. False and Misleading Descriptions. Food advertisements and labels have been scrutinised for false and misleading statements and descriptions. Other than the cakes and sweets specified in this report no infringements were disclosed. Corrective action taken within the whole area of the County has equal effect within the Boroughs and work under this heading is combined with inspections made to ensure the proper operation of the Merchandise Marks Acts and the Labelling of Food Order. Special Designated Milks. During 1959, 60 samples of designated milks were taken, one of which failed to satisfy the methylene blue test for keeping quality. However no action was taken as the failure does not constitute a breach of licence within the meaning of Section 43 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955. Safe Milk. In addition to the foregoing, 7 samples of raw milk were procured within this Borough and submitted to test for the presence of tubercle bacilli. None was found contaminated. Meat Inspections During 1959 one remaining slaughterhouse in Southall Borough situated at St. Bernard's Hospital was closed down. Before closure, 55 pigs were slaughtered for consumption within the hospital. No diseased animals were found. Regulations in 1959 made under the Slaughterhouse Act, 1958, asked for consultation with local interested persons to be carried out regarding the needs of the Borough for 40 slaughterhouse provision, but the decision was reached that facilities available elsewhere were enough and that no Corporation slaughterhouse need be provided within the Borough. The District Public Health Inspectors are qualified to inspect meat to be consumed by the public and visits are paid to butchers shops, grocers shops, canteens and restaurants where meat is inspected both in bulk and after cooking. In addition to these routine spot inspections a visit is paid immediately on receipt of a complaint either from a member of the public or from a trader that meat is suspected of being unsound. Food Premises—Inspection There was an increase in the amount of visiting to food premises during 1959. Certain new shop premises with first class modern design and applying modern hygienic standards to methods of food handling have been opened in the Borough and this helps to improve the standard of existing food premises because of the competition for trade which ensues. The number of food premises in the Borough by type of business is shown as follows:— Shops 332 Greengrocers 48 Grocers 116 Confectioners 95 Fish Friers 11 Bakers 17 Butchers 33 Fishmongers 12 Catering Establishments (including Canteens) 130 Food Factories 20 482 Premises required to be registered are as follows:— Food & Drugs Act, 1955, Section 16 Fish Curing 7 Manufacture of Sausages or Preserved Food 30 Manufacture of Ice-cream - Sale only of Ice-cream 132 Manufacture and Sale of Iced-Lollies Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, Section 11 Premises of Street Traders 8 Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949 Dealer/Processors 1 The following table shows the quantity of food examined and the disposal of condemned food.

The averages of total solids deposited were reduced in 1959 from the 1958 figures at the Hortus Cemetery site and at Dormers Wells, but after an increase in 1958 there was a further rise in the year's figures for the Railway Allotments site where the total deposit was more than twice that found at the Dormers Wells site. 1959 was a year of low rainfall which always gives improved figures for solids deposited so that the figures recorded are not truly indicative of any improvement in the amount of atmospheric pollution in Southall. In fact, since in 1957 the figure at the Hortus Cemetery site was 10-66 in a comparatively wet year compared with 13-04 in 1959, a very dry year, it suggests that atmospheric pollution is increasing. The results obtained from the five sites, i.e. Recreation Ground and Railway Allotments —lead peroxide method, Hortus Cemetery, New Primary School, Railway Allotments— deposit gauges, are tabulated on page 46 and graphs prepared from the figures on the tables are to be found on pages 47-49. Comparison of eight years' averages at Hortus Cemetery.

Observations of individual factory chimneys seeming to be emitting smoke or grit to excess were continued throughout the year. There was a marked improvement iu the amount of smoke emission recorded during these observations. Details of the observations made because of particular subjects of complaint and the results of these observations can be seen in the following table. 1959 1958 Number of sites of routine observation 5 (3 deposit gauges and 2 lead peroxide gauges) 5 (3 deposit gauges and 2 lead peroxide gauges) Number of complaints of nuisance from smoke, smell or grit and number of premises concerned 16 complaints re 12 premises 34 complaints re 23 premises Number of places kept under observation 19 15 Number of observations made 76 83 Number of times black smoke was detected 2 16 Total time of black smoke emissions 2 A minutes 13¾ minutes Number of times dark smoke observed 16 47 Total time of dark smoke emissions 62 f minutes 249I minutes Minimum time of observations 10 minutes 1 minute Maximum time of observations 110 minutes 35 minutes Total time of observations 2,073 minutes 1,276 minutes On 2 occasions black smoke (Ringelmann 4) was detected from 2 industrial premises; On 16 occasions dark smoke (Ringelmann 2-4) was detected from 8 industrial premises. The debate continues between public health and town planning interests on the height of chimneys, within the confines of Section 10 of the Clean Air Act, 1956. In May, 1959, a local inquiry was held into an application for a new steel chimney (oil firing), the result of which permitted a chimney of thirty feet with an aluminium external shield. In no instance was black smoke emission of sufficient quantity to warrant prosecution. 44 Smoke Control Areas The coming into operation of the section of the Clean Air Act, 1956, on Smoke Control Areas meant that Southall had to be divided into districts to form a plan for the gradual obtaining of complete smoke control, and in 1959, Smoke Control Area No. 1 of 62 acres, in the South of the Borough, comprising approximately 300 Corporation-owned houses and shops together with 8 factories, was approved in principle by the Minister of Housing and Local Government. Not much work of adaptation was necessary and the Order was ultimately confirmed to come into operation on the 1st May, i960. In July, 1959, preliminary survey work was completed in respect of Smoke Control Area No. 2, adjoining No. 1 on the west and south, and comprising 860 dwellings, 6 industrial premises, 62 commercial (shops, etc.) premises, 18 other buildings (Churches, Library, School) and consisting of 82 acres, was submitted for approval in principle in 1959. 45 Atmospheric Pollution Estimation Month of Year Sulphur Trioxide Lead Peroxide Method, Milligrams per day per 100 sq. cms.

Byelaws of Good Rule and Government give control of noisy animals and a local example is donkeys grazing near houses. They were removed in the course of further proceedings. Section 313 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944, makes a noise nuisance a statutory nuisance under the Public Health Act, 1936. The offender can however plead that "the best practicable means" have been taken to prevent the nuisance and this is a sufficient defence in law. Stirring of the public conscience in this matter should oblige local authorities to establish a closer liaison between Planning Requirements and those for Public Health. Some measure of prior agreement will have to be secured when ownership changes of the small factories long established in residential areas. Examples of provisions likely to cause noise nuisance are the fitting of heavy iron factory doors and the use of corrugated iron. Rodent Control The following table gives details of work carried out in accordance with the policy of the Council, as outlined in previous reports. Total notifications Confirmed Non-Confirmed 245 180 65 Business and Industrial 33 Domestic 147 Rats 121 Mice 60 Total number of visits in 1959: 889 Sewers 1st Treatment Total number of manholes baited 48 Number of poison takes 11 There was no improvement in the figures for rat infestation during 1959. Pet Animals Act, 1951 Seven establishments were licensed during the year. The number of animals kept in each case is small and conditions have remained satisfactory. Administration of the Shops Acts Routine visiting of shops in connection with the Shops Acts Regulations continued. River Pollution Inspection of the rivers and canal of Southall, during the year did not give evidence of any individual site of pollution on which action could be taken, therefore, no work on the abatement of pollution of rivers was carried out during 1959- Middlesex County Council officers carried out certain improvements to the River Crane in Southall to relieve flooding in the Delamere Road area. This has already been mentioned on page 32. 50 Establishments for Massage and Special Treatment Seven establishments were inspected for licence under this heading and all were found satisfactory for the purpose which was intended. Details are as follows:— Purpose No. of Licences Chiropody only 2 Massage, Chiropody and Electrical Treatment 5 Medical Examination of Borough Council Employees During 1959, a total of 78 medical examinations were carried out on applicants for Borough Council employment or members of the Borough Council staff. These examinations were carried out with regard to suitability for employment on the Council's permanent staff, for entry into the Sickness Pay Scheme, or for review after prolonged periods of sick leave. A survey of sickness absence amongst Borough Council staff during the year is shown in the table below. Members of Indoor Establishment Year Staff Total Requiring sick leave Total days sick leave Percentage requiring sick leave 1959 157 93 1,295 59 1958 154 37 1,183 24 Members of Outdoor Establishment Year Staff Total (Part-time and Full-time) Requiring sick leave Total days sick leave Percentage requiring sick leave 1959 282 206 5,371½ 73 1958 299 194 5,509½ 65 Nuclear Radiation The increasing production, transport, and use of radioactive material means that a new Public Health problem can arise. It has become apparent that some method of control is necessary and that a local authority requires to be informed of all possible sources of radiation within its district. Radioactive isotopes are used in industry, in hospitals and in technical schools and colleges, and it is important that as much information as possible should be available as to the precautions taken in the use of the substances, and what, if anything, has to be done about waste products. At present the total use in Southall is extremely minute. The Metropolitan Water Board now gives with its monthly report on the state of the water coming into public supply, a short notice of the radioactivity as estimated by the Board's Laboratory Staff, and also records the reports of the Atomic Energy Authority on the radioactive content of outfalls into the Thames from the Nuclear reactors. 51 HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHER AUTHORITIES North-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board Through the Uxbridge Group Management Committee this authority maintains two hospitals in Southall, the Southall-Norwood Hospital (28 beds) for treatment of general medical and surgical cases and casualties, and Mount Pleasant Hospital (59 beds) for the treatment of geriatric cases. St. Bernard's Hospital is managed by its own Committee and is for the reception of cases of mental and nervous disorders; it has 2,507 beds and takes patients from an extensive area, comprising parts of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Middlesex, including the Borough of Southall. Voluntary, temporary and certified patients of all types are admitted, and all modern forms of treatment are carried out. Patients are now admitted informally (under the Mental Health Act, 1959) and in due course the above categories will be replaced by two only, viz. Informal and Compulsory. Other hospitals outside the Borough which are used to a considerable extent by patients from Southall are Hillingdon Hospital, West Middlesex Hospital and King Edward Hospital, Ealing, and Southall cases for geriatric treatment may be admitted to St. John's Hospital, Uxbridge. The greatest number attend Hillingdon, which has all the facilities of an Acute General Hospital, a Geriatric Section and a Maternity Wing, either as outpatients, or as inpatients; in 1959, 2,077 Southall residents had inpatient treatment in Hillingdon compared with 1,940 in 1958. The Uxbridge Chest Clinic is the regional centre to which residents of the Borough of Southall may be referred regarding chest disorders. It is also the regional centre for the diagnosis, treatment, aftercare and prevention of tuberculosis (both pulmonary and nonpulmonary). Persons may be referred there by their own doctors, from Clinics, etc. Special "X-ray only" Clinics are available without appointment, otherwise persons are seen by appointment. There are male and female beds under the surveillance of clinic physicians at:— (1) Harefield Hospital for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis; and at (2) Hillingdon Hospital for the treatment of other chest disorders. County Council of Middlesex—Health Department The County Council of Middlesex is the Local Health Authority under the National Health Service Act, 1946, and provides the following services in the Borough. (a) Care of Mothers and Youns Children Ante-Natal Clinics Infant Welfare Clinics Jubilee Gardens Centre, Northcote Avenue and 13 King Street. Diphtheria, Whooping Cough and Tetanus Immunisation, Smallpox and Poliomyelitis Vaccination Clinics Jubilee Gardens Centre and 13, King Street. Ultra Violet Light Clinic Northcote Avenue Clinic.

(This work was formerly undertaken by " District Nurses.") Where nursing equipment is required for use in the home, it is available on loan through the British Red Cross Society. (e) Vaccination and Immunisation In addition to the vaccination and immunisation of infants and young children carried out at the clinics already referred to, vaccination and immunisation against the diseases mentioned on the previous page are carried out by most general practitioners. (f) Prevention of Illness, Care and After Care The County Council's scheme includes provision for the admission of suitable cases to recognised recuperative homes. (Such cases should not be in need of medical or nursing care.) The care and after care of tuberculous persons is dealt with through the Welfare Officer at the Chest Clinic. (g) Home Helps Home help for householders where this is required owing to the presence of a person who is ill, lying in, an expectant mother, mental defective, aged, or a child not over compulsory school age within the meaning of the Education Act, 1944, is provided under the County Council's scheme. (h) Ambulance Service A County Ambulance Service is provided for the removal to hospital, where necessary, of accident and sickness cases. There is an Ambulance Accident Station situated in Southall beside the Town Hall, and the Sick Removal Service operates from the Depot in Hanwell. (i) Mental Health Service The Mental Health Service deals with persons suffering from mental deficiency or mental illness.
