To the Worshipful The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Islington. Gentlemen, It affords me much pleasure to submit for your consideration my report on the health and sanitation of your Borough during the year 1900. Before the recent census had been taken the bulk of it had been written, and indeed all the rates had been calculated on the supposition that the population had continued to increase in the proportion that had obtained between 1891 and 1896. The census returns, however, came as a great surprise to everyone, for they showed that there had been a slight decrease. Consequently, all the rates are slightly in error. This proves, however, to be very small as is shown by the following figures. The 5,721 deaths from all causes were calculated to have produced a death-rate of 16.23, but the revised population shows that it should have been 17.02 per 1,000; the 660 deaths from the zymotic diseases were supposed to have produced a zymotic death-rate of 1.87 per 1,000, whereas it is now known to have been 1.96; and, lastly, the 2,276 cases of infectious diseases were considered to have produced a case-rate of 6.46 per 1,000 instead of 6.77 per 1,000, which we now know to be the true rate. These differences are so small that I may say they have been ignored by the Registrar-General in his annual return for London. The true death-rates can, however, be easily ascertained by multiplying those given in this report for 1900 by the factor 1.049. Thus, for instance, the death-rate for the year, 16.23x1.049=17.02. I am, Your obedient servant, Medical Officer of Health. July 1st, 1901. 9 [1900 REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health FOR THE YEAR 1900. The ratios relating to the deaths, births, and marriages that have occurred in the Borough during the year 1900 have been calculated on the basis of the following figures, which are also those used by the Registrar General.

It is impossible to assert positively that it is accurate, but it can hardly be supposed that any vital error can be made in so short a period as five years, the length of time that has elapsed since the last census was taken. In 1891 it was ascertained that in every 1,000 of the population, 118 were under 5 years of age. 206 were between 5 years and 15 years. 200 „ „ 15 „ 25 „ 172 „ „ 25 „ 35 „ 124 „ „ 35 „ 45 „ 87 „ „ 45 „ 55 „ 54 „ „ 55 „ 65 „ 28 „ „ 65 „ 75 „ 11 „ ,, 75 ,, 85 ,, and upwards.

The mortality returns are particularly good, whether they be compared with the record of the preceding five years, with the years preceding to 1885, with which period they have for statistical purposes been generally contrasted, or, with the sixty-four years which have elapsed since death registration was commenced; for in all this period they have only been as few, due correction having been made for the great increase in the population, on three occasions, namely, in 1889, 1894, and 1897. The number of registered deaths was 5,721, or a decrease of 554 on the corrected average of the preceding fifteen years, 1885-99, prior to which time it would be necessary to go back thirty-five years before a return that was nearly so good could be found. This was in 1850, when 1,609 deaths were registered, which in a population of the size of last year would represent 6,197 deaths, or 376 more than the present return. The death-rate was equal to 16·23 Per 1,000 of the population, or 1·57 per 1,000 below the mean death-rate of the preceding fifteen years, in which period the previous lowest records were 16·10 in 1889, 15·92 in 1894, and 15·80 in 1897. There is no doubt that had not the severity of the first quarter caused so many deaths from respiratory diseases the mortality would have been the lowest hitherto experienced. The death-rate must also be considered as satisfactory because it is below the "Standard Death-rate" of the Borough, 17·90 per 1,000. By standard death-rate is meant the rate at all ages calculated on the hypothesis that the rates at each of twelve age periods were the same as in England and Wales during the ten years, 1881-90. Too much stress is not, however, placed on this fact, as within the last decade no doubt the death-rate of the country has improved; but to what extent can not be known with accuracy until the census returns as to ages and number have been published. Death-rates in past years.—From what has been written above it is to be gathered that there has been a great improvement in the death-rate when comparisons are made with the rates that obtained in past years. In studying the death-rate at this period, the close of the century in which for the first time a systematic endeavour has been made to accurately determine the mortality returns of this country, this would appear to be an opportune time to place on record, not only for the purpose of contrasting the present state of health of this Borough, as judged by the death returns, but also for placing on record for future reference the returns from the time when the registration of deaths first began in 1837. At present such death returns are only to be obtained in the annual reports of the registrar-general, while the death-rates are not to be found at all. The following table has consequently been compiled, which it is hoped, may prove useful to every person who takes an interest in the health of the borough in which he lives. They will be found to be as nearly accurate as it has been possible to obtain them. 1900] 22 The death-rates have been calculated for each on a careful estimate of the populations as revealed by the census returns which were obtained at the close of each successive decade.

No doubt its situation has had a great deal to do with this good health, and no doubt also its wide thoroughfares have contributed to a large extent. The Borough has not, however, been built on a soil—which is clay—that naturally promotes vitality, but rather on one which has an opposite tendency, so that its salubrity must be due to other causes. It will be noticed that in the first three decades of the table—1841-50, 1851-60, and 1861-70—the death-rate gradually increased, for in the first of these ten-yearly periods it averaged 19·28 per 1,000 in the second 21·43 per 1,000, and in the third 24·64 per 1,000. Then it gradually decreased, so that in the ten years 1871-80 it fell to 20·40 per 1,000, in the succeeding decade 1881-90 to 18·60 per 1,000, and in the third to 17·50 per 1,000. It may be noticed in passing that during the last seven years of the 1871-80 period the death-rate ranged between 20·07 and 20·65 Per 1,000, and that in three consecutive years, 1875, 1876 and 1877, it stood at 20·07 per 1,000. Now it is a noticeable fact that it was not until the public of this country began to take an interest in health matters in the early seventies, which culminated in the passing of the "Public Health Act, 1875," that the death-rate showed a decrease. The two succeeding tables, one of which(Table XIII) has been taken from the Registrar-General's Annual Summary for 1900, gives a comparative statement of the mortality experienced in the thirty-three great towns of England, while the other table(XIV) has been constructed by your Medical Officer of Health to show a similar comparison with the Metropolitan sanitary areas. It would, perhaps, be well, before studying the tables, first to explain what is meant by the several terms used in the tables. The Standard Death signifies the rate at all ages calculated on the hypothesis that the rates at each of twelve age periods in each town, or sanitary area, were the same as in England and Wales during the ten years, 1881-90, the rate, at all ages, in England and Wales during that period having been 19·15 per 1,000. The Factor for Correction is the figure by which the Recorded Deathrate should be multiplied in order to correct for variations of sex and age distributions, and is obtained by dividing the Standard Death-rate in England and Wales by the Standard Death-rate in each town. The Corrected Death-rate is the Recorded Death-rate multipled by the Factor for Correction. The Comparative Mortality Figure represents the Corrected Deathrate in each town and sanitary area compared with the Recorded Death-rate at all ages in England and Wales in 1900 taken as 1,000. 24 1900] Table XIII.

The Parish was passing through a transition stage with regard to it, for whereas contractors used to pay for the privilege of being allowed to collect the dust, which at that time and previously was a saleable commodity of considerable value, they were then demanding large payments for removing it. For example, in the year ending June, 1866, the Vestry received £1,288, in 1867 £2,200, in 1868 £140, and in 1869 £200 for the privilege. Then a complete change was effected, for instead of contractors paying they were paid. In the year ending June, 1870, the Vestry paid £1,795, in 1871 £2,937, and in 1872 £4,057, and for nine months ending March, 1873, £3,204 for dust removal. The change was without any doubt a change for the better; but what a contrast* with the method of dust removal of the present day, which is regular, thorough and satisfactory. But this matter will be dealt with in another portion of this report. A "constant" water supply, too, was commenced in this period to be supplied, although it was only completed within the last two years; and the scheduling of slum properties (High Street Scheme and Essex Road Scheme) under the provisions of "The Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1875" (Cross' Act), was begun by the Metropolitan Board of Works on the representation of the late Medical Officer of Health, but the clearances were not effected until 1882 or 1883. The condition of the slaughter houses was also greatly improved through being governed by new regulations framed by the late Metropolitan Board of Works, under the provisions of the "Slaughter Houses Act, 1874." At the beginning of this decade 492 houses were in course of erection, while 2,414 stood empty, so that plenty of houses were available, although not altogether that description of property which the owners would desire to be occupied by the artizan class, or even the lower middle class, but properties of a superior character, much of which had been occupied by wealthy people, large numbers of whom could afford to keep their carriages. Many of these houses were afterwards, and are now, let out in tenements, as the owners could not for ever afford to keep them empty. Nevertheless, at this period (1871) the average number of persons in occupation of each house was 7.9, which was slightly above the number, 7.5, which occupied them in 1861, and was an increase of 0.4 persons per house; and this, too, notwithstanding the fact that the number of inhabited houses in Islington had increased in ten years by 6,375. In same time the population had increased by 58,408 persons, which, if distributed among the newly-built houses, would have given nearly 9.2 occupants to each house. This, of course, did not actually occur, but as the decade advanced they gradually occupied many of the uninhabited houses, and so kept down the greater crowding which undoubtedly would have arisen. * In year ending March 25, 1876, 36,867 complaints were received, or at the rate of 1361 per 100 houses.— Vide M.O.H.'s Report, 1875-6. 27 [1900 The ninth decade, 1881-90, began with an increased population of 69,116, and with an addition of 6,967 inhabited houses, or at the rate of 9.92 persons for each additional house. There were also available 1,944 uninhabited houses, mostly highly rented premises; and there were also 563 in course of erection. The actual proportion of inhabited houses was 1 to every 8.3 persons, which was an increase of 0.4 persons on the preceding census return. During these ten years the death-rate was 18.60 per 1,000, which must be considered good, especially in the face of the more crowded conditions which prevailed. In the tenth decade, 1891-1900, there was a still further decrease in the deathrate, for it fell from 18.60 per 1,000 to 17.50 per 1,000 inhabitants, and that, too, despite the continued and increased crowding of the people. The population increased at the census of 1891 by 36,278, and the inhabited houses by 3,829, or in the proportion of 1 house to every 9.9 of the new inhabitants, while the number of inhabitants to each inhabited house in Islington rose from 8.30 to 8.43. What the increase is to-day is not yet known, although doubtless before these pages are in print the numbers will be available from the new census returns; but, whatever else they may tell us, they ought to reveal a still further crowding of the people, because at the present time there are only 658 empty houses in the whole of the Borough, whereas in 1891 there were 1,656, together with 237 in course of erection. The comparison then of the death-rate of the last year of the century stands as shown in the following statement:— 1838-40 (3 years.) 20.55 per 1,000 inhabitants. 1841-50 19.28 ,, ,, 1851-60 21.43 ,, ,, 1861-70 24.64 ,, ,, 1871-80 20.40 ,, ,, 1881-90 18.60 „ „ 189I-1900 17.5 „ „ 1900 16.23 „ „ The three first years of the last decade showed a mean rate of 19.23 per 1,000, but from that period to the end of 1900 it was only 16.72 per 1,000, and in its last year only 16.23, which must be considered a really remarkable death-rate in a large community with a mixed community like that of Islington. As the significance of death-rates are not generally very well understood, and as the statement that it fell from say 20.0 per 1,000 to 18.0, seems such a small thing in itself it may be of advantage to take the last fifteen years and to translate in figures what the deaths would have been in each year if the population had been in each of these years the same as it was in 1900. These results are given in the following statement:— 28 1900] Years. Recorded Deaths. Deaths which would have occurred if the population had been the same as in 1900. 1886 5,434 6,352 1887 5,699 6,584 1888 5,197 5,929 1889 5,035 5,675 1890 6,152 6,850 1886-90 27,517 31,390 1891 6,326 6,970 1892 6,075 6,620 1893 6,391 6,889 1894 5,263 5,613 1895 5,760 6,078 1891-95 29,815 32,170 1896 5,884 6,142 1897 5,395 5,555 1898 5,705 5,828 1899 6,293 6,360 1900 5,721 5,721 1895-1900 28,998 29,609 Gross Total 86,320 93,169 Here we see from the figures in the third column that the improvement in the death-rate means that if in each year the population had been 352,491 as in 1900, but with the same death-rate that obtained in those years, there would have occurred in five years, 1886-90, 31,390 deaths instead of 27,517; in the five years, 1891-95, 32,170 instead of 29,815; in the five years, 1895-1900,29,609 instead of 29,998; and finally in the fifteen years, 1886-1900, there would have been registered 93,169 deaths instead of 86,320 or a difference of 6,849 deaths. This is quite a fair method of comparison, because it shows in actual figures the real difference between one year and another. It is evident that it would be very unfair to compare the number of deaths in any one year with those of another without making an allowance for the difference in the size of the population, although in the same borough, just as it would be equally unfair to contrast the number of deaths in one town with those of another town without making a similar allowance. The Meaning of the 1900 Death-rate.—The true meaning of the death-rate of the year will be better appreciated when it is pointed out that if so 29 [1900 good a one had obtained during each of the last fifteen years only 53,123 persons would have died instead of 86,320; or in other words 33,197 would be alive to-day who now are dead, which means an annual saving of 2,212 lives. The maintenance of the present death-rate is, therefore, well worthy striving for; it is an aim which should ever be foremost in the minds of the guardians of the public health of the district, the Aldermen and Councillors as well as the officials. The object is a great one; for what can be nobler than the saving of human life And the means to accomplish it are laid down on broad and well defined lines, which all who are willing to understand cannot fail to appreciate. Much has been accomplished during the last six years by the Public Health Department, and it is hoped that even greater results will accrue from its efforts, despite the attempts made in interested quarters to decry its work. That work stands, however, its own monument, which no amount of captious criticism can discount. The Public Health Committee of the late Vestry understood its responsibility towards the public, and did not hesitate to recommend to that body such additions to the staff, or such works to be executed as it considered necessary for the welfare of the parish which it governed. The men who laid the foundations of the Public Health Department were men whose names will always be looked up to by everyone who was cognisant of the proceedings of the Vestry. They did a great good for Islington, and they deserve unstinted credit for what they have done. They lead the way in sanitation in London, and the example set by Islington has been followed in every part of London. It will not, however, be an easy task to maintain the death-rate of the borough at the low level of the last five years, because of the continual increase and consequent crowding of the population, the change in the character of the community, and consequently of its habits, the erection of factories and the consequent smoke, and the erection of buildings on the vacant land, which it is stated does not now amount to more than forty acres. But still much may be done, even more than at present by the systematic registration of tenement houses, which will prevent overcrowding and ensure more wholesome surroundings; by the insistence of an ample water supply to every separate set of lodgings; by the firm administration of the laws relating to adulteration, particularly the adulteration of milk; by the thorough examination of the food supplies; by the inspection of all places, not merely bakehouses, where such food is made or prepared; by the more frequent cleansing of the streets in which the least well-to-do of the community reside, and by the better keeping of the roads and their channels. These are all necessary to be done, for if neglected, without doubt, though there may be a saving of money, there will be a loss of human life, which will make itself apparent in a rising death-rate.* * Since these words were written the census returns have been issued, and though the improvement here indicated in the death-rate has not been so great as was thought, yet it has been very considerable, and therefore, those remarks remain in the main quite true.—A.E.H. 1900] 30 MORTALITY IN THE SUB-REGISTRATION DISTRICTS. Of the 5,721 deaths that occurred in the Borough 1,635 occurred in Upper Holloway, 738 in Lower Holloway, 932 in Highbury, 1,004 in Barnsbury and 1,412 in Islington South East. Upper Holloway. There were 1,635 deaths registered, of which 842 were those of males and 793 females; and they were equal to an annual death-rate of 15.50 per 1,000 inhabitants. The death-rate in the preceding nine years averaged 17.6 per 1,000. The return must, therefore, be considered very good. This district has invariably since 1893 had a good repute, as may be seen by the following statistics:— Years. Deaths. Death-rate. 1891 2,176 = 24.01 per 1,000 inhabitants. 1892 2,158 = 23.40 „ „ 1893 1,702 = 18.14 „ „ 1894 1,458 = 15.30 „ „ 1895 1.564 = 16.12 „ „ 1896 1,603 = 15.93 1897 1,481 = 14.75 „ „ 1898 1.530 = 15,00 „ „ 1899 1,698 = 16.37 „ „ 1900 1,635 = 15.50 „ „ A detailed statement of the causes of death are given in Table D in the Appendix. Lower Holloway. 738 deaths were registered, 380 being of males and 358 of females. These represented a death-rate of 17.35 per 1,000 of its population. As this is a new sub-registration district it is impossible to compare the present return with those of preceding years. A full statement of the various causes of death are given in the Appendix (Table D). This Sub-district is really Ward 4, and is that part of the borough bounded on the west by the borough boundary, from the northern boundary of the North London Railway to the centre of Camden Road; on the north-west by a line along the centres of Camden Road and Parkhurst Road, from the borough boundary opposite York Road to the centre of Holloway Road; on the north-east side by a line along the centre of Holloway Road, from opposite the centre of Parkhurst Road to opposite the northern boundary of Highbury Station; and on the south by a line along the northern boundary of Highbury Station, the North London Railway and Barnsbury Station, and again along the northern boundary of the North London Railway, from the centre of Holloway Road to the borough boundary in the centre of York Road, 31 [1900 Highbury. There were 932 deaths, 842 males and 793 females registered, which are equal to a death-rate of 13.43 per 1,000. This is a particularly low death-rate, and indeed was actually the lowest in any of the sub-districts. This Sub-district consists of Highbury Ward, Mildmay Ward and part of Canonbury Ward. From 1891 to the present date its annual death-rates have been remarkably low, as may be seen by the following figures:— Years. Deaths. Death-rate. 1891 937 = 15.76 per 1000 inhabitants. 1892 952 = 15.73 „ „ 1893 1,008 = 16.37 „ „ 1894 865 = 13.80 „ „ 1895 939 = 14.73„ „ 1896 997 = 15.08 „ „ 1897 886 = I3.43 „ „ 1898 931 = 13.87 „ „ 1899 1,093 = 16.01 „ „ 1900 932 = 13.43 „ „ All the causes of death are set out in Table D in the Appendix. Barnsbury. The returns show that 1,004 persons died, of whom 528 were males and 476 females. These deaths represented a mortality of 17.55 Per 1,000 inhabitants. This is also a new sub-district, and consists of Thornhill and Barnsbury Wards, and it is, therefore, impossible to give the statistics for preceding years. All the causes of death are set out in Table D in the Appendix. Islington, South-East. This is too a new sub-district, comprising the whole of St. Mary's and St. Peter's Wards and that part of Canonbury which is not included in the Highbury sub-district. The mortality returns showed that 1,412 persons died, 716 being males and 696 females, and that the death-rate was 18.11 per 1,000 on the estimated population. The full statement as to the several causes of death are set out in the Appendix (Table D). Table XV.

AGES AT DEATH. In the annexed table (XVII) there is a full statement of the number of persons who died at thirteen age periods. On examining this table the first and most notable feature that is evident is that at each of the age periods under 15 years there was a decrease in the number of deaths. Thus, during the first year of life the number fell from an average of 1,446 to 1,344, being a decrease of 102; in the period 1 to 5 years the number decreased from the average of 852 to 612, a decrease of 240; and in the period 5 to 15 the number fell from 234 to 183, or a decrease of 51. These figures are particularly gratifying, because it is just at these ages that insanitary conditions are most harmful, and most fatal to human life. Considering the improved sanitary conditions that have of recent years existed in Islington, it is not remarkable that this decreased mortality should have occurred. 33 [1900 Table XVII.

SEASONAL MORTALITY. The mortality in the several quarters has already been fully set out in the quarterly returns which have been issued, from which it appears that the smallest number of deaths occurred in the third quarter, when 1,221 were registered, and the highest in the first quarter, when 1,819 were registered. In the second quarter there were 1,390 deaths, and in the fourth 1,291. Deaths. Death Rate. 1900. Mean Death Rate 1885-99.

There were only 660 deaths registered from the principal zymotic diseases, by which term is meant Small Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Typhus Fever, Enteric Fever, Continued Fever, and Diarrhoea. The number now registered is 234 below the corrected average that occurred during the fifteen years 1885-99. These deaths represented a death-rate of 1•87 per 1,000, as against 2•00 per 1,000 in England and Wales; 2•50 in the 33 Great Towns, 2•25 in the 67 other large towns, and 1•57 in the rural districts of England and Wales. From this comparative statement the Borough must be considered to have been more free from fatal cases than the country generally. A similar remark will apply when a comparison is made with the seven largest great towns, for it will be seen (Table LII.) that in London the rate was 2•19 per 1,000, in Bristol 1•88, in Birmingham 2•72, in Liverpool, 3•18, in Manchester 3•05, in Leeds 2•92, and in Sheffield 4•33 per 1,000.

Small Pox. Only one death from this disease was registered as against an average of slightly over one in the preceding ten years. In the report for 1899 a statement was made which showed the deaths in quinquennial periods since 1856, which showed that previously and up to 1885 this disease was very fatal, but that since the latter period they have not averaged two per annum. The deaths in the Borough during the preceding ten years were:— 1890 0 deaths. 1896 1 death. 1891 0 „ 1897 1 „ 1892 3 „ 1198 0 „ 1893 2 „ 1899 0 „ 1894 3 „ Average 1 1895 1 „ 1900 1 death. MEASLES. There were 159 deaths from Measles registered, as compared with an average of 192 in the preceding ten years. These deaths were equal to a death-rate of 0•45 per 1,000.

There were 24 deaths registered, or 9 less than in the preceding year, 33 less than in the ten years, 1890-99. The return is the lowest ever known in the Borough, although it was approached in 1886, when there were 26 deaths, and in 1898 when a similar number was registered. In each quinquennial period since 1856 the average number of deaths, together with the lowest in any one year during five years, was as follows:— Quinquennial Period. Total No. of Deaths.

The 149 deaths registered from this disease showed an increase of 28 over the the uncorrected average of the preceding nine years. By far the largest number occurred in the first quarter, when 122 were registered, only 17 being credited to the second quarter, 3 to the third, and 7 to the fourth. In the succeeding table it will be noticed that since 1896, when only 33 deaths occurred, there has been a gradual increase in the mortality; for in 1897 it will be noticed that 47 were registered; in 1898 65; in 1899 126, and in 1900 149.

In several places, some in London, some in the Provinces, voluntary notification has been established, and is said to have met with success. The subject is one that has long since engaged the attention of your Medical Officer of Health, for so long ago as 1892 he read a paper before the Sanitary Institute Congress strongly advocating its notification, but his views were not accepted. The feeling on this subject has much changed since then, for not only do the medical profession but also the intelligent public recognise that it is a preventable disease, and to use His Majesty's phrase, are asking, " if preventable, why not prevented ?" 73 [1900 There can be little doubt that this matter will receive a great deal of attention after the Congress on Tuberculosis has held its meetings, as the public will then have been awakened to the good results that may be expected to follow its notification. INFANTILE MORTALITY. One thousand three hundred and forty-four deaths were registered among infants under a year old, as against an average of 1,430 which obtained during the seventeen years 1883-99.

THE NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. The return is the most satisfactory that has been known since 1891, when, after making allowance for the difference in the size of the population, it was almost identical with that of the year 1900. Indeed, it is quite possible that there were proportionately fewer infectious diseases in the past year than in 1891, because in this period notification was only in its infancy, and medical practitioners were not so careful in complying with the law. In 1891, the case-rate per 1,000 of the population was 6.43 per 1,000 of the estimated population, whereas in 1900 it was 6.46. From 1891, however, until the present date, no case-rate has been recorded which is so low as the present one, the nearest approach to it being that of 1898, when it was 7.01 per 1,000. The total number of cases of the notifiable infectious diseases reported by medical men during 1900 was 2,276, or 1,038 below the corrected average of the preceeding nine years; while the case-rate, 6.46 per 1,000, was 2.94 below the mean rate, 0.40 of the same year. The present return is therefore eminently satisfactory. The records for the ten years 1891 to 1900, inclusive, were as follows:- Years. Cases. Case-rate. 1891 2,059 6·43 per 1,000 inhabitants. 1892 3,318 10·26 „ „ 1893 4,853 14·84 „ „ 1894 3,121 9·44 „ „ 1895 2,841 8·50 „ „ 1896 3,822 11·15 „ „ 1897 2,906 8·51 „ „ 1898 2,418 7·01 „ „ 1899 2,943 8.44 „ „ Corrected average 1891-9 3,314 9·40 „ „ 1900 2,276 6·46 „ „ Decrease 1,038 2·94 „ „ 1900] 76 The enormous decrease of 1,038 cases below the corrected average was practically divided, although unequally, among all the infectious diseases, for in only one class, Enteric and Continued Fevers, was there an increase. Thus Small Pox showed a decrease of 37 cases, Scarlet Fever 677, Diphtheria 155, Membranous Croup 20, Erysipelas 138, Puerperal Fever 17, Cholera 1. The increase from Enteric Fever was only 6, and from Continued Fever 1. Typhus Fever remained at its average of 1 case. The Borough returns compare with the returns of the Encircling Districts, as follows:- Case-rate. St. Pancras 7·60 per 1,000 inhabitants. Stoke Newington 8·80 ,, „ Hackney 8·10 „ „ Hornsey 5·30 „ „ Clerkenwell 6·00 „ „ St. Luke 6·50 „ „ Shoreditch 8·20 „ „ The Above Disticts (collectively) 7·47 „ „ Islington 6·46 „ „ In London the case-rate was 7.68 per 1,000 inhabitants. In the Sub-Registration Districts the diseases were distributed as follows:— Cases. Case-rates. Upper Holloway 639 6·06 per 1,000 inhabitants. Lower Holloway 263 6·18 „ „ Highbury 460 6·63 „ „ Barnsbury 340 5·94 „ „ Islington, South-east 574 7·36 „ „ The Borough 2,276 6·46 „ „ It is seen from these figures that the lightest incidence of the diseases occurred in Barnsbury, where the case-rate was only 5·94 per 1,000, while the heaviest occurred in Islington South-east, 7.36. 77 [1900 The notifications in the several Wards and the resulting case-rates are shown below:- Cases. Case-rates. Tufnell 190 5·49 per 1,000 inhabitants. Upper Holloway 233 6·02 „ „ Tollington 216 6·72 „ „ Lower Holloway 263 6·18 ,, ,, West Highbury 253 6·48 „ „ East Highbury 207 6·82 „ „ Thornhill 196 5·83 „ „ Barnsbury 144 6·11 „ „ St. Mary's 130 7·22 „ „ Canonbury 181 6·89 „ „ St. Peter's 263 7·82 „ „ The Borough 2,276 6·46 „ „ From this return it is seen that in Tufnell, Upper Holloway, Lower Holloway, Thornhill and Barnsbury Wards the incidence of the diseases was below the mean rate of the Borough; that in West Highbury it was just at the mean; and that in the remaining five wards it was above it. St. Mary's, Canonbury and St. Peter's Wards exhibited the highest rates. In St. Mary's this was due to the great prevalence of Diphtheria; while in Canonbury and St. Peter's it was accounted for by an excess of Scarlet Fever cases. For full particulars for each ward reference should be made to tables LXXVII. and LXXVIII., on pages 92 and 93. SMALLPOX. Only 2 cases were notified, and of these one from Highbury Quadrant proved fatal, while the other, which had been sent from Goodinge Road to the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospital, was returned home with an intimation that it was not Small Pox. The case-rate did not reach 0.01 per 1,000, it was really 0.005. The notifications were 37 below the corrected average for the previous nine years. The returns since 1891 have been as follows:- 1891 1 case. 1897 3 cases. 1892 42 cases. 1898 0 „ 1893 118 „ 1899 3 „ 1894 90 „ Corrected mean 39 „ 1895 25 „ 1896 50 „ 1900 2 „ 1900] 78 SCARLET FEVER. There were 1,074 cases notified, or as many as 677 below the corrected average of the preceding nine years. This is the lowest return, with the exception of that of 1891, that has been previously notified. It is, indeed, an extraordinary large decrease, and one that it is very difficult to account for. It is 420 below the number recorded in the preceding year. The case rate was 3.05 per 1,000 inhabitants, and was 1.92 below the mean rate that obtained from 1891 to 1899. The disease was unusually dormant during the first three quarters, the cases being respectively 222, 210 and 236. As the fourth quarter advanced, however, it became more prevalent, and the number at its close reached 406. In London the case-rate was 7·68 per 1,000, and in the Encircling Districts 7·47 The notifications in the preceding years have been as follows:- 1891 728 cases 2·27 case-rate per 1,000 inhabitants. 1892 1,709 „ 5·29 „ „ „ 1893 2,880 „ 8·81 „ „ „ 1894 1,493 „ 4·52 „ „ „ 1895 1,692 „ 5·06 „ „ „ 1896 2,031 „ 6·01 „ „ „ 1897 1,577 „ 4·62 „ „ „ 1898 1,336 „ 3·87 „ „ „ 1899 1,494 „ 4·28 „ „ „ Corrected mean 1,751 „ 4·97 „ „ „ 1900 1,074 3·05 „ „ „ Decrease 677 „ 1.92 „ „ „ Table LX.

The cases are, therefore, 155 below the average, and the case-rate 0.44 below the mean of the nine years, 1891-9. 1900] 80 Only on two occasions previously has the return been so good, namely, in 1895, when it was 564, and in 1898, when it was 531. The case-rate of 1.77 per 1,000 contrasts favourably with that of the Metropolis, in which it was 2·57, and with that of the Encircling Districts, where it was 2·49 per 1,000.

This was practically the only disease which showed an increase when compared with the corrected average of the number of the notifications. Altogether 259 cases were notified as against a corrected average 253, or an increase of 6. This increase is more than accounted for by the 13 cases that occurred in the Workhouse (Boys) Schools, Hornsey Road.

The diminution of cases under this head was very marked, for the return of 285 cases, equal to a case-rate of 0.81 per 1,000 of the population, was 138 below the corrected average of the years 1891-9. Only in a single previous year, namely 1898, was the record so good, and then the number was 279, and the case-rate 0.80 which was practically the same proportion to the inhabitants as that now recorded. In London the case-rate was 1.04 per 1,000, and in the Encircling Districts 1.05, so that the Borough rate contrasted favourably with these returns.

There were only 16 cases of this disease known, namely, 1 in the first quarter, 3 in the second, 1 in the third, and 11 in the fourth quarter. These cases were in the proportion of 1.73 to every 1,000 registered births, which was smaller than any rate chronicled in the nine years 1891-9. 87 [1900 The preceding returns have been as follows:— 1891 33 cases 3.67 per 1,000 registered births. 1892 51 „ 5.34 „ „ 1893 38 „ 3.90 „ „ 1894 23 „ 2.42 „ „ 1895 22 „ 2.23 „ „ 1896 30 „ 3.02 „ „ 1897 27 „ 2.74 „ „ 1898 19 „ 2.86 „ „ 1899 33 „ 3.42 „ „ Mean 33 „ 3.78 „ „ 1900 16 „ 1.73 „ „ This return is exceedingly gratifying, as Puerperal Fever is possibly the most fatal disease with which woman are afflicted. This may be well understood from the fact that out of the 16 cases notified 6 died, or 37.5 per cent. In every instance the most careful enquiries were made as to the cause of the disease, and in several instances it was very evident that it arose from dirty surroundings, or want of care as to cleanliness on the part of the attendants or nurses, who were often unskilled persons. In at least five instances it became necessary to request midwives, in large practice, to suspend their occupation for a lengthened period, lest they should convey the disease to other parturient women; and it is pleasing to record that compliance was at once and readily made with the requirement. It cannot be said from the evidence that was obtainable that these nurses were the cause of the disease, indeed, in some of the cases it was clearly evident that they could not have been; but still, in the interest of the public, it became necessary that they should forego their practice until such time as it might be fairly assumed that they, having been thoroughly disinfected, might safely resume their business. Cause of the Disease.—It is generally caused by septic matter—i.e., matter that promotes putrefaction—coming into contact with the wounded inner surface of the womb after child birth, or with the dilated veins and lymph channels which are at that time abundant, or with some part in the genital tract where lesions or injuries exist, all of which things are of common occurrence during labour. The septic poison may be introduced from without during labour by persons coming into contact with the patient conveying the infection through their clothes, their hands, by sponges or even by surgical instruments; also by the bedding, sheets, diapers, or by the air conveying the infection from such a disease as 1900] 88 erysipelas under treatment in the same house; or it may arise from putrefactive changes occurring in the genital organs themselves, or by the retention of a part or parts of the placenta. From these remarks it can at once be seen that to a large extent the disease is preventable, and that a great responsibility rests on persons in attendance on women during their confinement; for as they are careful or negligent in matters of cleanliness, whether of personal clothing, hands, sponges, instruments, or of bedding, diapers and patients' clothing, will there be a probability or an improbability of their patient being attacked. Indeed, it should be laid down as a rule by everyone in attendance on a patient that they should not touch her without first carefully disinfecting their hands. Medical men understand the necessity of such a practice and adopt it; but, it is regrettable to think that midwives or nurses either through their ignorance or carelessnessdo not; and that consequently puerperal fever arises more frequently when the patients are under their care than when in charge of a medical practitioner. There is no question also that many cases arise through the failure or neglect of nurses to freely use disinfectants (carbolic acid 1 to 40 or corrosive sublimate 1 to 2,000) in all the necessary washings or syringings. The habits of the patient, too, both as regards her personal clothing, her bedding, her house or rooms have a powerful influence in promoting the disease. The woman, knowing she is about to be confined, who wilfully or negligently fails to make her surroundings thoroughly clean and wholesome is undoubtedly going a long distance on the road to meet this serious disease which so often ends, as already pointed out, in death. That this statement is no exaggeration, the figures that follow conclusively prove. They give the percentage of deaths to notified cases in Islington during the last ten years:— Cases. Deaths. 1891 33 8 24.2 deaths per 100 cases. 1892 51 23 45.1 „ „ 1893 38 13 34.2 „ „ 1894 23 8 34.8 „ „ 1895 22 12 54.5 „ „ 1896 30 11 36.7 „ „ 1897 27 10 37.0 „ „ 1898 19 7 36.8 „ „ 1899 33 14 42.4 „ „ 1900 16 6 37.5 „ „ Totals 292 112 38. 89 [1900 It will be noticed that the fatality varied from 24.2 per cent. to 54.5 per cent. in the ten years. Great as this fatality is, it is small, indeed, when compared with that which obtained in the Metropolis during the nine years 1891-9, during which period out of 2,558 cases 2,138 died, or translating it into percentages, out of every 100 puerperal fever cases 83.6 died. Such a fatality is truly staggering, and, therefore it behoves every person, whether accoucheur, midwife or nurse, whose duty it is to attend on women in child-bed to adopt every precaution that forethought can . prompt, or that science has made available.

Notifiable Diseases.—It was found that 914 children, who suffered from one or other of the notifiable infectious diseases, were scholars attending the public elementary schools; and that 1,117 scholars, who, although themselves not ill, lived in houses in "which one of these diseases was present, and who consequently were excluded from school until the patient had been either removed to a hospital or had recovered, and the premises had been disinfected. The scholars who were attacked suffered from the following diseases:— Smallpox 1 Scarlet Fever 547 Diphtheria 289 Enteric Fever 64 Other notifiable diseases 13 Total 914 It will be noticed from the succeeding statement that these figures are, on the whole, an improvement on those of the preceding year:— Smallpox Scarlet Fever Diphtheria Enteric Fever. Other Diseases Total. 1894 3 842 355 28 12 1,240 1897 — 753 267 38 12 1,070 1898 — 640 206 37 8 891 1899 — 725 290 61 11 1,087 1,900 1 547 219 64 13 914 N on-Notifiable Diseases.—In addition to the above diseases there are others, which, though of an infectious nature, are not compulsorily notifiable, either by parents, guardians, or by the medical profession, but which, under the Code Regulations of the School Board for London, must be notified by the teachers of their schools. These diseases are Measles, Whooping Cough, Chicken Pox and Mumps. For a very long while many of the teachers in these schools were very remiss in notifying these cases to the Medical Officer of Health, but at length a great improvement has taken place, and, as the returns for 1899 showed an improvement on those of the preceding year, so do those for 1900 show a great improvement on those for 1899. In 1899 twenty-eight schools forwarded returns, while in 1900 thirty-seven schools sent them. In 1899 information was forwarded respecting 829 cases while in 1900 it was received with respect to 3,066 cases. Measles. Chicken Pox. Whooping Cough. 1899 604 78 177 1,900 1,619 365 434 1900] 102 Great though this improvement has been there is still some laxity in reporting the cases immediately; for, unfortunately, some teachers seem to forget the code regulations (which instructs them to report the case at once to the Medical Officer of Health) until they find that a considerable number of their children are absent through some particular disease, and then, becoming alarmed, they notify them, but in such large numbers that it is impossible for the sanitary staff to attend to them in a satisfactory manner without completely disorganising their other duties. Besides which the great advantages which an early notification gives are lost; and children, who are not themselves ill, but who live in infected homes, are allowed to attend other elementary or private schools with the result that they too may become infected.

Sanitary Condition of Schools: Cleanliness of Children: Infectious Diseases: Notification: Symptoms. Cleanliness of Schools and Children. 148. (i.) In order to maintain the sanitary condition of the schools, the head teacher of each department is held responsible for seeing that the following regulations are carried out:— (a) The whole premises are to be properly ventilated, both during school hours and after the children have left. (b) The rooms are to be washed at least once every three weeks except where otherwise ordered by the Works Committee. (c) Children who may present themselves in a dirty condition are to be required to wash at once; and, if further purification is needed, to be sent home for the purpose. (d) Each child in the school is to be provided with a peg, on which must be hung its cap, bonnet, cloak, or shawl. (e) Any bad smells arising from defective drainage are to be reported at once to the head office. (f) The urinals and drains must be sluiced out twice a day, viz., in the middle of the day and after school in the evening. (g) Schoolkeepers are not supplied with disinfectants, as the Works Committee are of opinion that if the troughs, urinals, and w.c.'s are systematically and thoroughly flushed in accordance with the code of instructions for the guidance of schoolkeepers, the use of disinfectants will be unnecessary. In the event of it becoming necessary to disinfect a school or schoolkeeper's house, the local authorities must be requested to carry out the work. Infectious Diseases—Notification. (ii.) The following infectious diseases are dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, as notifiable diseases:— Small-pox. Scarlatina. Cholera. Scarlet Fever, and the fevers Diphtheria. known by any of the following Membraneous croup. names:- typhus, typhoid, Erysipelas. enteric and relapsing. 1900] 104 Any child showing symptoms of any of the above infectious diseases, or any child coming from a house where such an infectious disease exists, must be sent home at once, and the superintendent of visitors must be immediately informed of the case, care being taken to state the name of the child infected, in order that inquiries may at once be made with a view to proper steps being taken to prevent the children living in the same house or tenement from attending school. The medical officer of health for the district must also at the same time be informed of the child's exclusion, and furnished with the name and address of the child and the reason for its exclusion on a form with which the teachers will be supplied by the head office. Note—The above instructions to exclude children who are not themselves showing symptoms of infectious illness, but because of their coming from houses where infectious diseases exist, does not apply to typhoid, enteric fever or erysipelas. Under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the medical officer of health must, whenever a case of a notifiable infectious disease shall, in the first instance come under his notice, forward direct to the head teacher of a school attended by a scholar suffering from an infectious disease, or attended by any child who is an inmate of the same house as the patient, a certificate notifying the fact. The notification certificate of the medical officer of health will be received by the head teacher, who must at once see that the communication is sent to the other head teacher, or head teachers, of the other department, or departments, of the school concerned, and each head teacher must initial and date the certificate. When the teacher has received this notification from the medical officer of health, and taken all necessary action, he should note upon the certificate the action taken, endorse it with his name and the name of the school, and also state upon it whether the patient is a scholar of the school, and, if so, the department of the school which the patient attended before illness, and forward it immediately to the head office, addressed " The Medical Officer, School Board for London, Victoria Embankment, W.C." The teacher should likewise send notice of the case to the superintendent of visitors, if that has not already been done, on a form to be supplied for the purpose from the head office, care being taken to state the name of the child or family infected. Children excluded because of a notifiable infectious disease, or because of such an infectious disease in the houses in which they live, must not be allowed to return to school unless a certificate has been received from the medical officer of health, stating that the premises are free from infection. Head teachers will note that the certificate forwarded by the medical officer of health merely states that the premises from which the children come are free from infection, and does not certify that the children are in a condition to be permitted to resume attendance at school, for it may be that, though the premises are free from infection, the children coming from such premises may be sickening for an infectious disease. It will be necessary, 105 [1900 therefore, for a further period of seven days to elapse before the return of such children to school, unless the medical officer of health shall specially certify that a longer period of absence is necessary. In the event of the head teacher not receiving the certificate stating that the premises are free from infection, it becomes his duty to send to the offices of the local authority in order that he may procure it. Infectious Diseases not Notifiable, but to be excluded. (iii.) The following infectious diseases are not dealt with as notifiable by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891:— Measles. Chicken-pox. Mumps. Whooping-cough. Any child showing symptoms of any of the above diseases or any child coming from the house from where such a disease exists, must be sent home at once, and the Divisional Superintendent, the Board's Medical Officer, and the Local Medical Officer of Health at once informed of the case, care being taken to state the name and address of the child or family affected, with the reason for the exclusion. This information is to be sent on a form supplied by the head office. It is only through information derived from the teachers that the existence of the above diseases is known either to the School Board authorities or to the officers of the Local Sanitary authorities. Information must therefore be given at once to the above three officers of all cases coming to the knowledge of the teachers, whether such cases are excluded by them or are kept at home by the parents. Children suffering from measles must be excluded for at least one month. Children coming from houses where measles exists, but who are not themselves suffering from the disease, must be excluded from school for two weeks. Children suffering from mumps must be excluded for one month. Children coming from houses in which mumps exist, but who are not themselves suffering from the disease, should be excluded from school for such time as the medical attendant on the case deems necessary. In cases where there has been no medical attendant, children should be excluded from school for three weeks. Children suffering from chicken-pox should be excluded for at least two weeks. Children coming from houses where chicken-pox exists, but who are not themselves suffering from the disease, must be excluded from school for two weeks. Children suffering from whooping-cough must be excluded as long as the cough continues. Children coming from houses in which whooping-cough exists, but who are not themselves suffering from the disease, must be excluded from school for two weeks. (iv.) Children suffering from ringworm or ophthalmia (blight) must be excluded from school, and the superintendent of visitors must be immediately 1900] 106 informed of such exclusion, and before their re-admission a medical certificate should be produced stating that the child is cured. Whenever such certificates are not readily procurable, the teachers should exercise their discretion as to admitting the children. Children coming from houses in which ringworm or ophthalmia exist, but who are not themselves suffering from the disease, should not be excluded from the school. (v.) If any children should show symptoms of any kind of infectious or contagious disease not mentioned in the above regulations, or should be known to come from a house where such an infectious disease exists, they must be excluded from the school, and the head teacher must at once write to the head office for instructions, and at the same time send a note of the case to the medical officer of health, to the medical officer of the School Board for London, and to the divisional superintendent. (vi.) Whenever teachers communicate with the medical officer of health for the district, relative to an outbreak of infectious disease in the schools, they must at the same time communicate with the medical officer of the Board. Symptoms of Infectious Diseases. (vii.) Most of these maladies are attended by the appearance of a rash upon the skin, but this eruption does not at once show itself. The child may ail for a day or two first and the rash not make its appearance until later. But even before the rash shows itself, there are usually certain symptoms present which should give rise to suspicion on the part of the teacher, and these indicate the need for watchfulness over the child. Thus, a child sickening for an infectious disease usually complains, perhaps, of headache, or perhaps of sore throat, and often the first symptom perceptible is a shivering fit and occasionally sickness. The more definite symptoms belonging to each disease will now be described, but it must be recollected that all these symptoms are not always present at the same time or even at all. The teacher, however, will be acting wisely in allowing a child who is obviously ill to go home at once ; but the child must be sent home under the charge of some responsible person, if an eruption upon the skin has made its appearance when the child is found to be ill. (See section ii.) The more common symptoms of the diseases to which attention should be directed are:— Scarlet Fever or Scarlatina.—The child feels ill, shivers, has a sore throat, which is followed usually about twenty-four hours from the beginning of the illness by the appearance of a scarlet rash on the chest, and which often extends over 107 [1900 other parts of the body and the limbs. The tongue is often furred, and the papillae are large and red, the throat is red, and the rash may consist of a uniform blush, or of a number of red spots. At a later date the skin peels, and the child cannot be regarded as free from infection until this process is fully completed. Diphtheria.—This affection often comes on less suddenly and severely than scarlet fever. There is no eruption, but one or more white patches appear on the back of the throat, on the soft palate, or on the tonsils. Measles. - This disease makes its appearance in the same manner as a severe cold, the child becoming ill and shivering, sneezing, and having a running from the eyes and nose, and often a sore throat. An eruption appears later, usually after a child has been ill three days. It consists of a number of raised red spots upon the face, chest, and often on other parts of the body and the limbs, usually arranged in a crescentic form. The symptoms of German measles, however, are somewhat different, and there is an absence of the indications of a severe cold. Small-Pox.—This illness usually begins with shivering, vomiting, headache, pains in the limbs, and particularly in the back. After the child has been ill two days, a pimply eruption appears on the face, chest, wrists, and often on other parts of the body. A little later the pimples become watery, and have a depression in their centre; later still the eruption becomes mattery, and a scab forms on each pimple. In mild cases there may be only a few points of eruption present. The child is not free from infection until all the scabs have been shed. Chicken-Pox.—The child is ill for a few hours, usually twenty-four, and a number of glistening watery pimples appear on the face, chest, and often on other parts of the body and the limbs, The whole of the eruption does not come out at once, but it usually appears in successive crops. The eruption scabs over in a day or two, and the child is not free from infection until all the scabs have fallen. Whooping-Cough.—The child has a severe cough, which comes on in paroxysms, and it coughs until it is out of breath. After some days' illness, the crowing noise or "whoop," which is characteristic of this disease, is heard, this sound being produced by the child drawing in its breath at the end of a paroxysm of coughing. Mumps.—The child becomes ill and feverish, and at the end of a few days complains of aching of the jaw. A swelling then appears on the side of the face, lasting for more than a week. Typhus Fever.—This disease is now seldom seen in London. The child becomes ill, shivers, and complains of severe headache. After a few days, a rather indistinct, dark, mottled eruption appears on the abdomen, and often on the wrists, and other parts of the body. 1900] 108 Diarrhceal Affections.—These cases should be very carefully watched, especially as typhoid fever often begins in this way. If children suffer from this ailment in the school, the attention of the schoolkeeper should be particularly called to the regulation relating to his work of cleansing the w.c.'s. (viii.) Teachers must be careful to keep accurately the registers with which they have been supplied for the purpose of recording the absences of children, either on account of their own suffering from infectious diseases, or because of there being infectious diseases in their homes, and also in filling up the fly-leaf to Form 101* which will be sent down with Form 9B of the Education Department. In every case the precise description of the disease must be given, e.g., if a child is suffering from fever, the kind of fever must be stated. "Note.—The regulations contained in this Article relative to the exclusion of children on account of infectious diseases apply also to Probationers, Candidates, and Pupil Teachers." FATALITY FROM THE NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Out of 2,276 cases of Infectious Diseases which were notified, 1,552, or 68·2 per cent. were removed to hospital for treatment, as against 64·6 per cent. so treated in the preceding year. Among the hospital cases 135 deaths occurred, or 8.7 per cent., while of the 724 cases treated at home 67, or 9·2 per cent. died. Altogether 202 deaths occurred among the 2,276 notified cases. Excluding Small Pox, from which disease there was a single notification and a single death, the highest mortality occurred among the puerperal cases, of which 6, or 37·5 per cent. died; while the lowest was from Scarlet Fever, from which disease only 24 cases out of 1.074 resulted fatally, or 2·2 per cent. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup was fatal in 167 per cent. of the cases, of which 633 were notified, and 106 died. 109 [1900 Table LXXXVII.

This is to be greatly regretted for two reasons, first because in doubtful cases, especially of Diphtheria, the medical attendants would often be able to diagnose the disease with a certainty, instead as frequently happens of not notifying it, because an element of doubt presented itself; and would on the other hand frequently not notify cases, instead of notifying them as at present, in which an element of doubt existed, and so saved the head of the family the trouble and annoyance of disinfection, It is greatly to be hoped that more frequent advantage will be taken of the borough council's arrangement to have these examinations made free of charge by the Jenner Institute, Diphtheria,-In 43 instances out of 105 specimens of mucus from the throats of patients examined, the bacillus diphtheria was discovered in 43, and not discovered in 62, so that 40 9 per cent, gave a positive diagnosis, Enteric Fever,-78 specimens of blood were examined, of which 33, or 42,3 per cent, resulted in a positive diagnosis of the disease, while 45 gave negative results, Phthisis, -Only 79 specimens of sputum were forwarded for examination, of which 35, or 44,3 per cent,, were discovered to contain the tubercle bacilli, In the annual report for 1899, p, 172, the method of examination was explained, The examinations were made under an arrangement by the Jenner Institute, who performed their work with the least possible delay, Since these diagnoses were started in 1898, 593 specimens have been examined, namely, 233 from cases of suspected Diphtheria, 202 from cases of suspected Enteric Fever, and 158 from cases of suspected Phthisis, Diseases.

not from insanitary surroundings ; not, surely, from personal or household uncleanliness, It has been impossible to discover its origin in her case, but, without doubt, she was brought in some obscure way either into contact with an unrecognised case of the disease, or with clothing or money which had been handled by an infected person, Since the introduction of glycerinated calf lymph, the possibility, always much exaggerated, of contracting a certain loathsome disease, has been entirely eliminated, so that there can now be no conscientious objection on that ground to 136 1900] vaccination, It is the law now (vide Clause 3 of the Third Schedule of the Vaccination Act, 1898), that, "All Public Vaccinations are to be performed with glycerinated calf lymph, or with such other lymph as may be issued by the Local Government Board," A great responsibility rests on the Vaccination Authority, which is the Board of Guardians, many of whose members are most anxious to fulfil their duty, while others, from conscientious motives, without doubt, seem anything but desirous to enforce the law, Possibly it is on this account that so many children in the Hornsey Road Parish Schools are at present unvaccinated, Such a state of affairs is lamentable, and a grave danger to the children in the schools, for at any moment, especially when it is recollected that some hundreds of people, coming from every part of the borough, visit the schools every month, there is the possibility of the disease being introduced from without, That which was possible to a lady living in Highbury Quadrant, who rarely went out of her house, who never came into contact with people from insanitary homes, is surely probable to scholars who are visited by such persons as have been mentioned, The two following tables are worthy the closest attention as showing the state of Vaccination in Islington at present and in past years :- 1897, 1898, 1899, Six Months 1900, 1 Births, number of 9,878 9,478 9,631 4,773 2 Successfully vaccinated 6,539 5,422 5,698 2,898 3 Insusceptible to vaccination 30 44 81 13 4 Had Smallpox — — — — 5 Died unvaccinated 954 1,068 1,048 410 6 Exemptions under sec, 2, Act '98 14 103 101 71 7 Postponed by Medical Certificate 220 251 333 159 8 Removed to other districts 81 92 120 94 9 Removed to places unknown 1,205 4,121 1,421 716 10 No of cases unaccounted for 835 1,070 815 414 11 Percentage of exemptions under sec, 2, Act 1898 0,14 1,09 1,04 1,48 12 Percentage of cases exempted by Medical Certificate 2,22 2,65 3,45 3,28 13 Percentage of cases not finally accounted for and for which no vaccination certificates have been received 24,0 32,2 , 29,11 30,4 137 [1900 Table XCV, Showing the State of Vaccination in Islington, 1880-1900, also in London and England and Wales, 1880-96, Year , No, of Births, Successfully Vaccinated, Insusceptible to Vaccination, Died unvaccinated, No, of exemption certificates, Postponed byMedical certificate, Remaining, Cases (cols, 6,7, & 8), not finally vaccinated per 100 births, In London, Rest of England, 1 2 8 4 5 6 7 8 , 9 10 11 1880 9,931 8,123 26 885 Not granted for years previous to 1897, 118 779 9.0 7.0 4.5 1881 9,993 8,339 21 812 89 730 8.2 5.7 4.3 1882 10,000 8,360 22 819 155 644 8.0 6.6 4.5 1883 9,950 8,192 25 890 194 644 8.4 6.8 4.9 1884 9,892 8,121 47 924 191 601 8.0 6.8 5.3 1885 9,683 7,874 41 991 157 617 8.0 7.0 5.5 1886 9,844 7,944 39 1,091 148 622 7.8 7.8 6.1 1887 9,732 7,769 44 1,133 171 615 8.1 9.0 6.7 1888 9,620 7,522 39 1,112 219 728 9.8 10.3 8.2 1889 9,638 7,581 22 1,120 198 717 9.5 11.6 9.6 1890 9,239 7,250 19 1,117 122 731 9.2 13.9 10.9 1891 9,823 7,584 33 1,145 131 930 10.8 16.4 12.9 1892 9,626 7,221 28 1,182 127 1,048 12.2 18.4 14.3 1893 9,757 7,251 38 1,222 132 1,114 12.7 18.2 15.7 1894 9,574 7,151 39 1,067 101 1,215 13.7 20.6 19.0 1895 9,959 7,079 50 975 237 1,620 18.7 24 9 19. 8 1896 9,752 6,575 46 854 223 2,054 23.4 26 .4 22. 3 1897 9,878 6,539 30 954 14 220 2,135 24.0 29.1 21. 6 1898 9,478 5,422 44 1,068 103 251 2,693 32. 2 not available, not available, 1899 9,631 5,698 81 1,048 101 338 2,370 29. 1 " " 1900 six m'ths 4,773 2,898 13 410 71 157 1,224 30.4 " " Note,—The figures in Column 8 are obtained by adding together the numbers given in Columns 3, 4, 5and 7 and deducting the total from the number in Column 2, The figures in Column 9 are a percentage statement, obtained by adding together the numbers given in Columns 6, 7 and 8 and applying them to the numbers in Column 2, 138 1900] DISINFECTION.

The two steam disinfectors, which are of the Goddard, Massey & Warner type, worked most admirably, and gave complete satisfaction, discharging their work to perfection, and causing no destruction to clothing or bedding. The following is a record of the work performed by these disinfectors:— 1895 17,240 articles. 1896 42,258 „ 1897 28,302 „ 1898 20,172 „ 1899 25,378 „ 1900 19,136 „ Total 152,486 „ The machines have never yet been worked to their fullest extent, for the occasion has never arisen. Should it however come, it is satisfactory to know that they are capable of performing very much more work than they are now required to do. There has never been a breakdown, which is mainly due to the fact that the machines are worked in alternate weeks, and in that way they are always kept in a good condition.

The carbolised creosote, which contains 25 per cent. of carbolic acid, is only distributed in blue fluted and hexagonal bottles, marked in raised letters with the word " poison," and with directions printed on a red label.

DUSTING AND SCAVENGING. Although this class of work does not fall within the administrative department of the Medical Officer of Health, yet it is of such importance, and has such a direct influence on the public health, for on its proper and efficient execution the health of the community to a not inconsiderable extent depends, that he always reports on the manner in which it is carried out. The applications for the removal of dust—that is to say, house refuse—which at one period were numbered by tens of thousands, have now fallen to a few hundreds. 141 [1900 Nothing but praise can be given to the officials who performed this work. It was done systematically and satisfactorily. Had it been otherwise, the Public Health Department would have been quickly made aware of any neglect by the receipt of complaints, or of applications from householders, or of reports from the Sanitary Inspectors. The total number of requests to have dust removed and complaints for nonremoval, numbered all told only 234, which is 28 less than in the preceding year. They reached 79 in the first quarter, 62 in the second, 50 in the third, and 43 in the fourth. At Lady-day the number of separate assessments was 45,571, and the proportionate number of applications was only a half of 1 per cent., or to be exact 0.513 per cent. The dusting of Wards 2 and 9 (Upper Holloway and St. Mary's) was specially good, as from the former only 9 applications were received, and from the latter as few as 3. To be able to judge of the improvements effected in the dusting of the Borough, it is necessary to go back ten years. 1891 10,138 applications 1896 245 applications 1892 9,964 „ 1897 312 „ 1893 4,986 „ 1898 303 „ 1894 4,506 „ 1899 262 „ 1895 2,506 „ 1900 234 „ The cleansing of the roads has also been generally good, although it is to be regretted that the sweeping of some of the main thoroughfares, especially when it becomes necessary to use large quantities of water, should not be completed at an earlier hour than at present, for it is occasionally difficult to gain access to an omnibus or a tramcar without wetting one's feet. This is a matter of great importance to people on their way to business, for they may not only be spattered with mud, which is a trivial matter, but may also get their feet damp or wet, which is one of concern, because It' may lead tc illness. Nevertheless, the street cleansing has been, as already stated, satisfactory, and has been effected in a capable way. That this is so the fact that few if any complaints were received during the year is clear proof. THE WORK OF THE INSPECTORS. Inspection of Meat. Inspector Young, who has charge of this important work, has discharged his duties in a most satisfactory manner. These have been very heavy, for it is not a small responsibility or an easy task to inspect the animals slaughtered in the 44 slaughter houses situated in various parts of your large Borough, more especially when slaughtering is for the most part confined to two days in the week, and is consequently carried on simultaneously in many places. 142 1900] When originally your Medical Officer recommended the appointment of a meat inspector, he calculated that about 6o,ooo animals were slaughtered every year in the private slaughter houses of Islington. Last year Inspector Young reported that 57,267 were killed in these places, the great majority of which he inspected, either while living or after death. It became his duty to seize nearly 19 tons of food, two tons of which consisted of tinned goods; over 6½ tons of meat seized in butchers' shops &c., mostly unsound; and over 10¾ tons of meat, mostly diseased, in slaughter houses. This is a good record of work, for it is much more difficult to examine animals in forty different slaughter houses than it is in a properly appointed abattoir or a public market, where the inspector has only to move slowly from one stall to another. A comparative statement of the animals slaughtered in 1899 and in 1900 shows that 9,838 more were killed in the latter year. 1899 1900 Increase + or Decrease — Oxen 2,386 2,965 + 579 Cows 402 668 + 266 Bulls 50 54 + 4 Calves 436 356 — 80 Sheep 43,252 52,760 + 9,508 Pigs 903 464 — 439 Totals 47,429 57,267 + 9,838 The diseases from which animals, the part or whole of whose meat was seized, suffered, were as follows:— Tuberculosis 152 animals Dropsy 2 „ Asphyxia 1 „ Abscesses 18 „ Parasites 143 „ Mammitis 9 „ Actinomycosis 2 „ Pericarditis 1 „ Pleurisy 5 „ Pyaemia 2 „ Bruises 3 „ Generally Unsound 18 „ Total 356 143 [1900 Only three prosecutions were taken, because it has been the desire of the Public Health Committee and the officials to do nothing to harass a great and most respectable trade, but rather to gain their confidence, and to let them see that unless they knowingly and wilfully exposed unsound, unwholesome, or diseased food, or prepared it for sale, they would not be subjected to proceedings in the courts. The result has been just what might have been expected, for the Inspector, instead of being a terror to them, has been their best friend, to whom they have gone for advice when in doubt as to the soundness of their meat, and to whom they have not hesitated to give all the information he might require. Inspector Young, through his courtesy as well as his knowledge of his work, has completely gained the respect of the trade, and it is not too much to say that they have complete confidence in his judgment. Herewith is given his report on his work for the year. It will well repay perusal, as it shows what a field there is in Islington for food inspection. MEAT INSPECTOR'S REPORT. Public Health Department, Town Hall, To A. E. Harris, Esq. January 24th, 1901. Medical Officer of Health. Dear Sir, I have the honour to report that during the year ending 31st December, 1900, 3,404 visits were made to the butchers' shops, preserved meat factories, stalls, etc., with the following results:— A large quantity of "Tinned Food," weighing over two tons, was seized in a store in Bride Street, Barnsbury. The food consisted of— Description of Contents of Tins. No. of Tins. Description of Contents of Tins. No. of Tins. Pine-apple 1,075 French beans 6 Sardines 574 Mixed vegetables 3 Tomatoes 281 Mushrooms 3 Lobster 164 Corned mutton 1 Prawns 54 Tongue 1 Apricots 18 Onions 1 Pears 12 Bottles of figs in syrup 20 Gravy 12 Total 2,231 Asparagus 6 The food had been obtained from a wholesale firm for "the purpose of feeding pigs," but evidently the owner considered what was good for pigs was also suitable for a certain section of the public, because he was proved to have sold a considerable quantity to shopkeepers. Fortunately his profitable career was cut short, and ended in his being sentenced to undergo three months' imprisonment. A shopkeeper was fined £5 and costs for exposing for sale unsound rabbits, etc., while a costermonger was fined £2 and costs for giving the public the opportunity of purchasing Christmas Turkeys at the sum of Is. 6d. each. The wholesale merchant who supplied him was fined £5 and costs for his share in the transaction. Over five tons of preserved tripe (which had become tainted, due to the evaporation of the brine) was found on a tripe-dresser's premises, but as there was no evidence of the firm's intention to sell the food, it was destroyed with the consent of the owner. 144 1900] Throughout the year the butchers' shops were kept in a fairly satisfactory condition. I note again an increase in the sale of refrigerated meat with a corresponding decrease in the sale of home-killed meat. This has been accelerated by the Board of Agriculture prohibiting the landing in this country of cattle and sheep from South America, due to their being affected with foot and mouth disease. I append a table showing the result of shop, etc., inspection, and the quantity of food destroyed with the consent of the owners. Articles. Cause for destruction. Weight in lbs.

Pickled tripe Tainted 11,904 — Veal „ 50 — Beef „ 561 — Mutton „ 75 — Fruit Unsound 589 — Sausages Tainted 13 — Pork „ 105 — Brawn „ 75 — Offal „ 376 — Rabbits „ — 42 Turkeys „ — 12 Fowls „ — 1 Eggs Unsound — 50 Total 13,748 105 Slaughterhouses. 2,682 visits were made to the slaughterhouses, of which there are at present 44 within the Borough, two licences having lapsed since 1899 owing to the owners "not having used the piemises for the purpose of slaughtering cattle therein for a period exceeding nine months," while one slaughterhouse was transferred to the Borough of Hackney, due to the re-arrangement ot the districts. Speaking generally, the premises have been kept clean and the by-laws observed. Since the Local Government Act came into operation the Borough Council is responsible for enforcing these by-laws. This is a distinct improvement, because there is now no necessity for a dual system of inspection, the County Council Inspector having previously to see that the by-laws were observed, while the Borough Inspector alone could inspect the animals and carcases deposited on the premises. One slaughterhouse yard was repaved during the year. The number of animals killed for human food within the slaughterhouses was as follows:— Oxen. Bulls. Cows. Calves. Pigs. Sheep. Total. 2,965 54 668 356 464 52,760 57,267 The quality of the animals slaughtered was good, the majority of the cattle and sheep being young, while the cows generally came from the London cowsheds, where they had been previously inspected by the London County Council Veterinary Inspectors. Owing to the systematic inspection we have been able to supply the London County Council with information re cows put out of the cowsheds. One instance may suffice to illustrate this. A letter was received from the Medical Officer to the London County Council stating that a week previous a cow which had been under the observations of the Veterinary Inspectors had been removed to some of the slaughterhouses within the Islington district, and asking if you could supply any information as to the disposal of the carcase. You were able to supply date on which the cow arrived at the slaughterhouse where it was slaughtered, and the result of the post-mortem examination; also how the carcase was disposed of. As the result of inspection, 356 carcases or organs were tound affected with disease during the year. Of these, 30 carcases and their organs were totally unfit for food, while 326 were found affected with localised disease necessitating the destruction of the affected parts only. I append a table showing carcases, etc., affected, how affected, nature of the disease, and how the carcases, etc., were disposed of:— I append a table showing carcases, etc., affected, how affected, nature of the disease, and how the carcases, etc., were disposed of:— 145 [1900 No. Description of Carcase.

Knackers' Yards. The knacker's yard, York Road, has been regularly visited. Improvements on the premises and plant at a cost of over £500 have been made during the year. That this has resulted in diminishing if not actually abolishing any nuisance that previously existed is proved by the absence of any complaint from the residents in the neighbourhood. The London County Council, at their Licensing Court in October, made it a condition on the renewal of the licence that the business should in future be conducted on the "Close Chamber System." Cowsheds and Offensive Trades. The inspection of the cowsheds and the offensive trades is now to be conducted by the Borough officials, but as these duties have only commenced I defer making any remarks on their present condition. Before closing this report I beg to thank you for the kind advice so willingly given at all times. I also desire to thank the Chief Inspector and the District Inspectors for their kind assistance.

On every hand there has been a general acknowledgment that the work performed by the Inspectors has been of a most useful character, and that the improvement in the sanitation of factories, workshops and workrooms has been very considerably improved through their action. It is further a matter of satisfaction that although the duties of the Government Inspectors and those of the Council at some points very nearly overlap each other there has been no clashing and no friction; but that, on the contrary, all have worked harmoniously together for the common good. There were on the registers 1,462 premises in which workpeople were employed, of which 1,011 were on the female inspector's register and 451 on that of the male inspector. During the year 7,411 visits were paid to the several premises, of which Miss Gray made 3,365, and Inspector West 4,046. These visits resulted in the following work being effected:— Workplaces— Inspections and visits 7,411 Overcrowded 22 Insufficiently ventilated 4 Workshops— Newly discovered 328 Reported to H.M. Inspector 124 Removed from Registers 221 Workroom cards distributed 323 k 2 148 1900] Sanitary Notices served 330 Sanitary Improvements— Ventilation to rooms provided 74 Rooms cleansed and limewashed 437 Yards, floors and roofs repaired 123 W.C.'s reconstructed or provided 99 W.C.'s provided with water 119 Water Cisterns repaired, cleansed or provided with covers 19 Drains trapped or ventilated 166 W.C.'s provided with separate water supply 119 Water Cisterns cleansed and covered 19 Dust Bins repaired and supplied 15 Overcrowding abated 22 These are some of the improvements that have been carried out, and which must have a most healthy effect on the lives of the workers. The most noticeable feature has been the large number of w.c.'s which have been provided in various workplaces, amounting to 92, a figure which brings the total number erected during five years to 241. Some little difficulty has been experienced in obtaining separate w.c.'s for the male and female workers, but when it has been pointed out to the proprietors that under Section 38 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, "Every factory, workshop, and workplace, whether erected before or after the passing of this Act shall be provided with sufficient and suitable accommodation in the way of sanitary conveniences with proper separate accommodation for persons of each sex," it was speedily removed, and the requirements of the Act were acceded to. MISS GRAY'S REPORT. The Town Hall, Upper Street, N. To A. E. Harris, Esq., 4th February, 1901. Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I have the honour of presenting for your consideration a report of my work for the year 1900. Register.—At the end of the year there were on the register 1,011 workshops, workshop laundries and workplaces, containing 1,643 workrooms. At the beginning of the year the registered workshops, &c., numbered 1,058, with 1,664 workrooms. The total has thus been reduced by 47, although 74 workshops and 92 laundries have been added to the register during the year. This reduction is partly due to the dulness of trade—which has been much felt by the manufacturers, and has caused many of the smaller workshops to be closed—and partly to the alteration in the boundaries of Islington. On the readjustment of the boundaries in November, the addresses of 21 workshops, &c., were forwarded to the neighbouring boroughs, into which they passed. From these boroughs the addresses of 17 workshops were received, in six of which I found women at work. Up to the end of December I had discovered nine other such workshops in the new streets. 149 [1900 I have forwarded to the Home Office the addresses of 124 workshops and laundries (where 408 females were employed) which had not been previously visited by H. M. Inspectors of Factories and Workshops. The system of registering by cards, which has been adopted during the year, has simplified the keeping of the register very considerably. The constant erasures and alterations, necessitated by the frequent changes of workshop premises and of occupiers, made the book register complicated and untidy. Now, cards can be added or withdrawn when necessary, and the register kept up to date with ease. The following table shows the trades which are carried on in the various workplaces:— Nature of Business. Number of Workshops. Number of Workrooms. Dressmaking 265 322 Tiemaking 87 98 Mantle and costume making 67 94 Millinery (infant and adult) 65 133 Fur sewing 47 63 Blouse and apron making 42 62 Tailoring 31 31 Underclothing making 31 38 Artificial flower making 23 47 Jet and bead work 21 33 Leather goods making 11 17 Cardboard box making 8 19 Boot and shoe making 8 11 Dressing gown making 6 8 Seed, music and drug packing 5 7 Collar and cuff making 5 7 Fancy goods making 5 9 Candle shade making 4 6 Infants' robe making 4 4 Rag picking and sorting 4 14 Curtain making 4 5 Wig and dolls' hair making 3 8 Lace goods making 3 3 Frilling making 3 4 Feather curling 3 5 Firewood cutting 3 5 Pickle and curry powder making 3 4 Hosiery 2 2 Umbrella making 2 2 Toy making 2 6 Brace making 2 4 Paint brush making 2 2 Confectionery 3 28 Surplice making 2 2 Embroidering 2 5 Button-hole making 2 2 Lantern slide, &c., making 2 2 Jewel and mandoline case making 2 3 Surgical appliance making 1 2 Gaiter making 1 1 Musical string, &c., making 1 2 Swansdown goods making 1 1 Artificial fly making 1 1 Cabinet making 1 1 150 1900] Nature of Business.

I have inspected 2,963 work-rooms. Besides the registered workshops and laundries, I have inspected homes of female outworkers, the public conveniences for women, and the sanitary arrangements for females employed in factories and steam laundries. Overcrowding.—I found nineteen workrooms overcrowded. In these the overcrowding has been abated. Eight of these workrooms were in the new workshops which have been added to this district owing to the alteration of the boundaries. In one workshop seven workrooms were overcrowded. This affords an illustration of the benefit of the system of having a card exhibited in each workroom, stating its cubic capacity. In the premises in question, the workrooms had been measured and their cubic capacity was stated on the Home Office form, which was kept in the office, but the managers seemed to be ignorant of the fact that in each of the seven rooms two or three persons more than the legal number were at work. I have distributed 323 workroom cards in the course of the year. Ventilation.—In two workrooms, structurally insufficiently ventilated, additional ventilators have been provided. On the whole, in the majority of the workrooms, more attention is paid than was formerly the case to condition of the air of the rooms. I find fewer windows and ventilators pasted over. In most cases the practice of heating the rooms by gas jets only has been discontinued, and gas stoves have been substituted with good results. There is still, however, great room for improvement in ventilation, and it is to be hoped that in time the evils of breathing vitiated air will be more fully realised. Cleanliness.—I found sixty workrooms in a dirty condition. These have been cleansed and whitewashed. Sanitary Defects.—In addition to the defects as regards cleanliness, &c., mentioned above, I have discovered, in the course of my inspections, 185 sanitary defects, liable to be dealt with under the Public Health Act. These are detailed in the appended summary of my work, and include fifteen defective drains, five cases of insufficient sanitary accommodation, forty-one sanitary conveniences with a defective water supply, &c. 151 [1900 I have served 47 intimation notices, and have personally supervised the abatement of 144 nuisances. Laundries.—The conditions of work in laundries are still far from satisfactory. The heat of the ironing rooms is one of the greatest troubles. On some hot days in July, I found that the average temperature of the ironing rooms which I inspected was 90°. It is difficult to see how this is to be avoided as long as it is permissible to have the iron heating stoves in the rooms where the women work. The temperature of these rooms is usually high in the winter months also, as the clothes are frequently dried overhead, while the women are at work. In Summer, however, the pressure of work is greater, and the long hours per day which the law allows, i.e., fourteen in the twenty-four, are more likely to be worked. As regards washhouse ventilation, the difficulty, especially in damp weather, is to get rid of the steam from the coppers. More than half of the workrooms, which I found in a dirty condition during the year, were in laundries where frequent whitewashing is necessary if the rooms are to be kept in a cleanly state. The conversion of hand laundries into steam or factory laundries continues, and in the course of the year many small businesses have been bought up by the owners of large steam laundries. Outworkers.—I have made 188 calls at the homes of women whose names and addresses were found on the list of outworkers of employers in Islington and other districts. I found that in 42 cases the outworkers were not known at the addresses given, or had given up work. In the remaining 146 cases I inspected the rooms in which the work was done, and found that in eight cases the rooms were used exclusively as workrooms ; in 85 cases the work was done in kitchens or sittingrooms (in 10 of which there were beds); in 17 cases bedrooms were used as workrooms, and in 36 cases the work was done in living rooms, which thus combined' the uses of kitchen, sitting room, bedroom and workroom. The outworkers were engaged in making articles of wearing apparel, such as mantles, blouses, ties, underclothing, children's dresses and shoes, &c. I have forwarded to the Medical Officers of Health of the districts in which they reside, the names and addresses of 168 outworkers, who work for Islington tradesmen. Complaints referred to H.M. Inspectors of Factories.—I have forwarded to H.M. Principal Lady Inspector of Factories various complaints, which have been made to me, regarding infringements of the requirements of the Factory Act in respect to hours of work, meal-times, &c., and also regarding inianitary conditions prevailing in workshops in other districts. I am. Sir, your obedient servant, JESSY M. S. GRAY, Inspector of Workshops. Table XCVIII.—Summary of Miss Gray's Work-shop Reports during the Year 1900. DESCRIPTION of WORK.

Town Hall, Upper Street, Islington, N. To A. E. Harris, Esq., January, 1901. Medical Officer of Health. Dear Sir, I have much pleasure in again submitting my report to you for the year ending 29th December, 1900. You will observe by the appended table that I have visited 4,046 places of business, consisting of factories, workshops, and workrooms in the Borough, having made 1,781 inspections and 2,265 re-inspections. These include the following trades:—59 tailors, 179 shoemakers, 284 pianoforte makers, 32 cyclemakers, 632 bakehouses, and 2,860 miscellaneous business places. These consist of— Printers. Ticket-writers. Box-makers. Umbrella makers. Bedstead makers. Walking-stick makers. Spring mattrass maker. Tin-box makers. Wool mattrass makers. Gut scrapers. Engineers. Tennis-bat maker. Birdcage making. Musical string maker. Furriers. Organ-builders. Rag-sorters. Forage cutters. Wood-choppers. Surgical instrument maker. Confectioners. Enamellers. Jam makers. Mineral water makers. Farriers. Table makers. Builders. Weighing-machine makers. Telescope maker. Lath renders. Wheelwright. Wax figure makers. Coach painters. Frilling making. Coach builders. Cork cutters. Barrow makers. Picture-frame makers. Cabinet makers. Stonemasons' works. Pianoforte-string maker. Slate works. Dressmakers. Marble works. Laundries. Bassinette makers. Paper-bag makers. Artificial flower making. t Paper sorters. Fancy goods making. Upholsterers. Capsule making. Polishers. Saw mills. Ladder makers. Paint-brush making. Sanitary Improvements.—During the same period I have served 283 notices for the abatement of various nuisances; 210 bakehouses and 168 workshops have been limewhited, whilst 859 other improvements were carried out under my supervision; 92 w.c.'s have been also provided at various factories and workshops. I find, on referring to my previous annual reports, that 60 were provided in 1899, 50 in 1898, 34 in 1897, and 5 in 1896, making a total for the five years of 241 additional closets. You will observe by the figures quoted above that a vast improvement has been made for the benefit of the employees, and that a very serious want of accommodation had existed, so that it really seems monstrous that such a state of things should have prevailed no doubt for years, that in some of the various work-places no sanitary conveniences had been provided, whilst in many others no attempt had been made to provide 154 1900] separate or additional accommodation for the sexes. There has been, I am afraid, a tendency on the part of some employers to overlook these things until they have been compelled by the service of a notice, when they feel aggrieved at having, after escaping for a long period, to improve the sanitary condition of their premises, whilst others comply readily with our request. I am looking forward in the coming year to a much greater improvement in this direction. Register.—In the past year 141 workshops, containing 492 workrooms, which have been measured, have been added to the Register, making a total of 451. Smoke Nuisances.—I find that 996 calls have been made by me to various localities in the Borough during the above-mentioned time for the purpose of taking observations of smoke from chimneys of factories and workshops, and have reported thereon. This has occasioned the serving of 48 notices by me upon the occupiers, three of which have been prosecuted and fired to the amount of five pounds and costs in each case. I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to draw your attention to the great amount of time which is spent by me in carrying out this necessary but arduous duty. It entails many hours of labour, which means that other important work has to be allowed to stand and wait, and at the same time very little to show in my report in return for the time which has been spent upon it. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, GEORGE WEST, Inspector of Workshops. SMOKE NUISANCES. In addition to the inspection of Factories and Workshops it was also Inspector West's duty to make observation of smoke nuisances. This has entailed 996 visits to various parts of the borough for the purpose of this special work. These observations entailed the service of 48 notices, which resulted in three prosecutions, and the infliction of three fines, each of five pounds and costs. Apart from these formal notices the inspector has had personal interviews in very many instances with the heads of offending firms. This work is a very necessary one and requires much more time than Inspector West is able to devote to it. Indeed, it is only bare justice to him to state that he has ungrudgingly given up many hours after five o'clock, when his day's work should usually cease, in making observations which can only be made at night. INSPECTION OF BAKEHOUSES. The importance of the inspection of bakehouses where the principal food of human beings is made is self-evident. This work also devolved on Inspector West, who has discharged his duty in a most satisfactory manner. Altogether, there are 273 such places in Islington, of which 166 or 60.8 per cent. are situated either entirely or partly under the level of the street or ground. Of these 273 there are 22 which are not at present in use, but which are, nevertheless, regularly visited, because it has been found that notwithstanding the provisions of the Factory Act that it shall not be lawful to use a place under ground as a bakehouse unless it 155 [1900 was so used at the commencement of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1895, i.e., January 1, 1896, such places have been surreptitiously re-occupied; and it was only on the representations of the Public Health Department that their use was discarded. So far as it is possible to make underground bakehouses sanitary these places have been so made. They are kept clean, well whitewashed, and free from drain and other nuisances, but ventilation is altogether another matter. They are even more difficult to ventilate than the stokehole of a steamship, for the latter, at least, by the movement of the vessel, obtains the benefit of an induced current of air into it, whereas the former possesses no such advantage. Legislation is much required to sweep away many of these places, which are a relic of ancient times, when sanitation was an unknown quantity. BAKEHOUSES IN ISLINGTON. Reg. No Street or Road.

During the year 41 additional houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family were placed on the register; and in the same period one house was removed from it, so that it now contains 459 houses. There are two inspectors engaged in supervising these premises, one of them (Inspector Jordan) devotes the whole of his time to the work, while the second (Inspector Cowling) is also employed in taking or procuring samples of food for analysis under the provisions of the Adulteration Acts. For the information of the Council it may be stated that for many years the principle adopted in placing houses on the register has been that only those houses whose owners neglected their sanitary state to the detriment of the tenants, or those in which the tenants were dirty in their habits and therefore required supervision, should be brought within the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. In this way neglected properties and uncleanly tenants have come under sanitary control, which has proved much to their advantage. Those of the working classes, especially the labouring classes, who have large families continue to find it more and more difficult to obtain suitable accommodation for themselves and their children, because owners and agents of property have, in increasing numbers, set their faces against letting tenements to people whose children number more than two or at the outside three. Some will not even let them then but only to families of which all the members are adults. At the time of writing there is a rumour that the census returns will show a decrease in the population of Islington. If this be so, then the only explanation that will account for it is that which has just been given, for it happens that there are more houses now occupied in the borough than there were in 1896, when the last enumeration of the population took place. 1900] 162 INSPECTOR JORDAN'S REPORT. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Upper Street, N., January, 1901. To A. E. Harris, Esq., Medical Officer of Health, Dear Sir, I have much pleasure in submitting my report to you of the works carried out during the year 1900 under my supervision, in accordance with section 94 of the Public Health (London) Act 1891, in respect to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. There are now 405 houses in my district—of course there is not much variety in the work—and the people do not yet seem to be any more cleanly or careful in their habits, yet I continue to extol the virtues of those two best disinfectants—fresh air and clean water. In March I served an intimation notice at each house, addressed to the landlord, calling attention to the annual cleansing in April, and during the year 438 intimation notices were served for the abatement of nuisances at the various premises. There were 19 prosecutions, two summonses were withdrawn on payments of 23s. costs, and the other 17 resulted in fines amounting to £22 2s. and costs £3 12s. During the year I have made 4,653 inspections and 1,511 re-inspections and calls, and have had 1,856 improvements carried out at 948 premises, the tabulated statement attached hereto show the details under their respective headings. Thirty houses were placed on the Register in my district during 1900 and one taken off the list in that part of the Borough under my supervision. I am, Sir, your respectfully, JAMES J. JORDAN, Inspector of Houses let in Lodgings. 163 [1900 Table C. Summary of Sanitary Work carried out by Inspectors Jordan and Cowling in Houses Let in Lodgings during the year 1900. Inspector Jordan.

Six thousand three hundred and seventy-two houses were inspected, of which 883 were the result of house to house inspections. These entailed 49,216 sub-. sequent calls for the purpose of supervising the works that had been undertaken to abate nuisances. The stables, yards and mews ways received much more attention than usual, for no less than 4,015 visits were paid to them, or 1,287 more than in the previous year. There has been a feeling in some quarters, that on more than one occasion has found utterance, that the sanitary staff of Islington is out of proportion to its size and requirements. This is altogether an erroneous view, for at the present time the proportion of inspectors to population, is less than the average for the whole of London. At one time the Islington staff was slightly above the average, but while other authorities have increased their inspectors to meet the ever-increasing sanitary duties devolving on them, the number of your inspectors has remained stationary. It will perhaps be a surprise to those persons who are of opinion that there are too many inspectors, to learn that their number does not reach the requirements of the Local Government Board, or of the County Council. The deficiency in numbers has, however, to some extent been compensated for by the judicious appointment of special inspectors for special work, so that those inspectors who have to deal with insanitary dwelling houses, that is the district inspectors, should not be taken away from their duties, which are very onerous, to inspect meat, to take observations of smoke nuisances, to visit houses let in lodgings, to examine laundries, to inquire into the state of outworkers' rooms, to watch for the starting of new workshops, and to see that all factories and workshops are kept in a sanitary state, to examine into the condition of cowsheds and dairies, to inspect slaughter houses and places where offensive trades are conducted, and to obtain samples of food under the Sale of Food and Drugs' Acts for analysis. It is because of the systematic division of labour that the number of the staff has been kept down, despite the ever-increasing duties devolving on your Medical Officer of Health and the inspectors under him. Improved sanitation is the great requirement of the age, and, therefore, it is no surprise to find that in many Acts of Parliament outside the Public Health Act, duties are cast upon sanitary officials of which the public have no notion. In one of the very latest Bills introduced into Parliament by the Government, the new Factory and Workshop Bill, very serious and weighty responsibilities are thrown upon the Medical Officer of Health and Sanitary Inspector, but especially upon the former. 165 [1900 The sanitary department of nearly all authorities are accused of unnecessarily harassing private interests, that is to say, the owners of property, whose constant cry of persecution very frequently begets in local bodies a feeling that such is the case. Again, builders and plumbers complain that they are compelled to do work they should not be required to do, but the answer to such a statement is that they cannot be forced to do anything outside the Act. But what are the facts? There has never been a ground for even the suggestion of persecution in Islington. But, on the other hand, there has been a straightforward administration of the Public Health Acts and the By-laws made under them—without favouritism, without respect of persons, without swerving from the straightforward path of duty. The great bulk of the properties dealt with in Islington have been inspected in the first instance because of a complaint, or because of the presence of an infectious disease in the house. When information of a nuisance, which may be made by "any person," not any ratepayer, not any Islingtonian, but anyone who chooses to make the complaint, whether it be through a direct interest in the health of the people living in the house, or through malice, or vindictiveness, or for any other reason, it becomes "the duty of the Sanitary Authority to give such directions to their officers as will secure the existence of the nuisance being immediately brought to the notice of any person who may be required to abate it, and the officer shall do so by serving a written intimation." But the Act does not stop with the action which the officer takes on his own initiative, for it goes on to enact in sect. 4, " that on the recipt of any information respecting the existence of a nuisance the Sanitary Authority shall serve a notice on the person by whose act, default, or sufferance the nuisance arises or continues." It is not only the officials, therefore, but also the Sanitary Authority them. selves who are bound to serve notices to abate nuisances. The Act goes a step further also, for it takes precautions to insure that its provisions are enforced, for in sec. 100 it recites that the London County Council" on its being proved that any Sanitary Authority have made default in doing their duty under the Act with respect to the removal of any nuisance, the institution of any proceedings, or the enforcement of any bye-law, may institute any proceeding and do any act which the Authority might have instituted or done for that purpose," and to recover from the defaulting Authority the expenses that have been incurred. But the Act goes still further, for in section 100 it states that "where complaint is made by the County Council to the Local Government Board that any Sanitary Authority have made default in executing or enforcing any provisions which it is their duty to execute or enforce of this Act, or of any bye-law made in pursuance thereof, the Local Government Board, if satisfied after due inquiry that the Authority have been guilty of the alleged default, and that the complaint cannot be remedied under the provisions of this Act, shall make an order limiting a time 1900] 166 for the performance of the duty of such Authority in the matter of such complaint. If such duty is not performed by the time limited in the order, the order may be enforced by writ of Mandamus, or the Local Government Board may appoint the County Council to perform such duty." It might also be mentioned that in sec. 39, which deals with the making of bye-laws by the County Council and by the local authorities with respect to water. closets, etc., it is enacted that "it shall be the duty of every sanitary authority to observe and enforce the bye-laws." From these quotations from the Public Health Act of 1891 it can be at once seen that neither the sanitary authority nor their officials have any option than to enforce these enactments. Indeed it would be absurd if it were otherwise, for far and away the chief and most important duty of a sanitary authority is the safeguarding and preservation of the lives of the people. If that duty be removed from them or be optional then the raison d'etre of their existence would be gone and their functions would become small in the extreme. It is, therefore, absolutely essential that they shall possess an adequate staff to perform their duties unless they would lay themselves open to be compelled, as a neighbouring authority was, to appoint a sufficient number of inspectors, or to have the grant under the Equalization of Rates Act stopped, for the very condition of its being given is dependent on its sanitary administration being efficient. Now it is pleasing to record that your sanitary inspectors have performed good work during the year, as may be judged by the following record of work contained in the two succeeding Tables:— 167 [1900 Table CI.

The staff of the Public Health Department effected very great improvement in the sanitary condition of Islington from the commencement of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to the time the Vestry ceased to exist, for they inspected 70,049 houses in which they caused 242,270 sanitary improvements to be made. The following statement gives particulars of these, and it will not be too much to say that the improved sanitation which they point to must have had a considerable 1900] 170 influence on the health of the community. The late Vestry may well be proud of this record, and the officials who undertook it may feel well satisfied with the result of their labours. That their action has met with favour by the public whose homes have been rendered more healthy, and by the County Council are matters for present satisfaction as well as an encouragement to persevere in their efforts to still further improve the conditions under which the citizens of Islington live.

As the condition of the health of the people is in no small degree dependent on its wealth or poverty it has been thought proper to give a return showing the amount of poverty in the borough as evidenced by the number of people receiving indoor or outdoor relief from the Board of Guardians.

The Inspectors under the Sale of Food and Drugs and Margarine Acts obtained 925 samples of food under the provisions of these Acts for analysis by the Public Analyst, and of these 124, or 13.4 per cent. were returned by him for prosecution. Under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts alone 885 samples were obtained, of which 111 or 12•5 per cent. were adulterated, while under the Margarine Act 40 samples were bought, of which 13 or 32•5 per cent, were sold contrary to the sections which provide for the proper marking and labelling of this food. The proportion of adulterated articles was above that of the preceding two years, but not so high as in 1892 and 1893. The subsequent statement does not include articles procured under the Margarine Act which does not deal with adulteration, but with the marking and labelling of packages and parcels, and therefore cannot be reckoned among the sophistications, only shows the amount of adulterations practised in the last ten years. 173 [1900 The following are the particulars for the past nine years contrasted with the returns of 1900 :— Year.

Week Day Milks.—These 224 milks, like those taken on Sundays, were purchased from the vendors on their rounds, or were bought in milk-shops. 30, or 13•4 per cent., were adulterated. Notwithstanding this fact, the analyses showed that their average composition was higher than the official standard. Official Standard. Fat 3•53 per cent. 3'0 per cent.

Their analyses showed a very high standard of quality, compared with which the official standard is absurd, and has recently been fixed on, much to the surprise of all chemists and authorities, as the official standard of the Board of Agriculture. Official Standard. Fat 3•93 per cent. 3•0 per cent. Solids not Fat 8•75 „ 8•5 „ Total Solids 12•26 „ 11•5 ,, Only a short time since a "Departmental Committee" appointed by the Board of Agriculture reported that milk should be looked on as sophisticated which contained less than 3•25 per cent, of fat, 8•5 per cent, of solids not fat, and 12•0 per cent, of total solids, but their recommendations have evidently been shelved. It will be noticed that the analyses of all the Railway Station Milks, presumably coming direct from the farmers, gave higher figures than those proposed by the Committee, and go a long way to prove that their proposal was fair to the farmer and a protection to the public. 175 [1900 Table CV.

Not a single complaint was received during the year as to the inadequacy or insufficiency of the water supply. It was in every way admirable. The supply which was at one time intermittent, is now constant, so that everyone can, if he desires it, obtain his water directly from the main without passing through a cistern, which is an abomination which should no longer be tolerated. In a report which your Medical Officer of Health submitted to his Committee, he pointed out with respect to storage cisterns :— That in No. i Sanitary District (Inspector Cook's) at Pemberton Terrace, owing to the inaccessibility of a cistern for examination, as well as to the fact that it was improperly covered, a dead animal very much decomposed was found in it, but not before a whole family had been stricken with severe nausea and diarrhoea, which nearly resulted fatally. That in No. 3 Sanitary District (Inspector Ward's), dead rats and mice had been found in many of them, and that here the cisterns were frequently situated under the roofs and even under bedroom floors, without covers, where if slop water should be spilled or if the floors should be washed, the water was certain to be polluted. That in No. 4 Sanitary District (Inspector Grivell's) a cistern was so placed that even the occupier of the house did not know where it was situated. The inspector, however, traced the main pipe and found it securely built under the roof, from which it became necessary to remove the slates before access could be obtained to it. When examined, dead rats, mice, birds and cockroaches were found in it, while the water was thick with dust, and covered with slime. It will be no surprise, therefore, to learn that the presence of enteric fever in the house was the cause of the inspection. That in No. 5 Sanitary District (Inspector Flood's) many cisterns were discovered under the rooms, and that as a rule they were found in a foul state, and contained soot, dirt, cobwebs, &c., and that frequently the surface of the water presented an oily appearance. That in No. 6 Sanitary District (Inspector Bagshaw's), particularly about Warner, Lesly and Sonning Streets, the cisterns were fixed on the flats, and so cheaply and badly covered, that it was a common event to find dead rats and mice in them. That in No. 7 Sanitary District (Inspector Lawrence's) many cisterns were found between the ceiling of the water-closet and the floor of the first-floor addition room, which was invariably used as a living room or a bedroom ; and that there were no covers to the cisterns other than the floor boards, which were in no sense 179 [1900 dust-tight, but on the contrary were very frequently loose and with considerable crevices between them, which, of course, allowed the water to be contaminated either with the spillings from chamber slops, or with the dirty water used in washing the floors, or with the dust that fell through when the rooms were swept. That in No. 8 Sanitary District (Inspector Metcalfe's) some cisterns were similarly placed. That in No. 9 Sanitary District (Inspector Irving's) a similar state of affairs existed. That in No. 10 Sanitary District (Inspector Watson's) cisterns have been found in washhouses, the roof being the only cover; while in some houses (Baxter Road and Norfolk Road) they were placed in cavities directly over exceedingly foul brick dustbins ; and that in some instances they were discovered under the landing floors, the latter being their only coverings. In these places the putrid bodies of mice have been found ; and that in one instance (Newington Green Road) the cistern was placed under the floor of an upper W.C., and that the water was filthy. The tenants did not know of its existence. The water was analysed by your Public Analyst, and was found to be contaminated with foecal matter. The tenants, it will be no surprise to learn, suffered from sores on the body, the result of blood poisoning. That in No. 11 Sanitary District (Inspector Fortune's) the majority of the cisterns are approached from the landing windows, Their covers being always exposed to the weather, soon decay, and in consequence small animals have found their way into them and were drowned. In one instance where three fatal cases of enteric fever had occurred (Windsor Street, Essex Road), the cover of the cistern was broken, and a ham bone, presumably carried thither by a cat, had fallen through and fouled the water. That in No. 12 Sanitary District (Inspector Preston's) many cisterns were placed over the W.C.'s. That in No. 13 Sanitary District (Inspector Rolfe's) they have been discovered in many and various places, and most difficult to reach, consequently they were frequently found in a dirty and most insanitary state, the water being covered with green slime and containing dead rats, mice, beetles, stockings and children's shoes. In one instance 20 living roach and dace were found in a cistern. That in No. 14 Sanitary District (Inspector Callow's) the cisterns were generally placed over the W.C.'s in the yards, and were therefore exposed to pollution from soot, dust, &c., through defective covers. M 2 1900] 180 In the face of such facts as these it would be almost impossible for any sane, unbiassed man to defend the retention of water storage cisterns for domestic water supply. That their continuance is a direct incentive to the water companies to give an imperfect constant water supply, and, therefore, to keep this huge Metropolis in a sanitary state which is far behind that of the Great Provincial Towns, in none of which are storage cisterns used, and in all of which there is a constant supply drawn through taps directly from the mains. No house in Islington is now granted a water certificate under the provisions of the Public Health London Act unless a separate supply and tap from the rising main is provided for domestic use, apart from that which passes through cisterns and is used for other purposes. During the year 89 certificates were granted. 181 [1900 BATHS AND WASHHOUSES. Table showing the numbers of persons using the Swimming Baths, the Private Baths and the Washhouses during 1900.
