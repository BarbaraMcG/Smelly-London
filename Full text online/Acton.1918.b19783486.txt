1938 TCT 21 The Urban District of Acton. Annual Report OF / The Medical Officer of Health For the Year 1918. i 1918 ANNUAL REPORT op the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1918. Council Offices, Acton, W.3. July, 1919. To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Acton. Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Annual Report for the year 1918. The Report is again condensed and only some features are commented on. The remaining subjects are set forth in tabular form. In previous reports it was stated that the Registrar General made two estimates of the population—one for deathrate purposes and the other for the birth-rate. The former is an estimate of the civil population only, whilst the latter includes the men on military service. I have discarded both estimates. For 1917, the Registrar General estimated the civil population at 58,507 and the total population at (55,219. In last year's report I stated that both these estimates were approximately correct. In 1917, over 58,000 sugar cards were issued and there were over 7,000 Acton inhabitants on military duty. For the year 1918, the Registrar General estimated the population at 57,221 for death-rate purposes and 64.114 for birth-rate purposes. These figures were based upon returns of 1918 4 Ration Cards sent to the Ministry of Food last July. The figures on the returns were incomplete as the returns were sent out soon after the issue of the ration books and did not include the ration books issued to those who had omitted in the first instance to fill in their addresses, &c. I pointed out this discrepancy to the Registrar General, and though it is obvious that an under estimate had been made, it was too late to remedy it in time for the Registrar General's report. It is evident that if the same procedure has been adopted throughout the kingdom a considerable error has occurred in the estimates of the population. In order to ascertain to what extent the population has been underestimated by the Registrar General I examined the ration book applications corrected for October. The figures would possibly be slightly different to those of July as corrections were made for removals into and out of the district and also the corrections made for births and deaths. These corrections would not be sufficient though to alter the figures of July very appreciably. There were no houses tr» let in July or October and the births did not greatly exceed the deaths. I have received the permission of the Ministry of Food to use these figures. The number of ration books in use in the district last October was 58,957. In addition, there are two public institutions in the district, for the staffs of which no ration books were issued. I estimate the civil population at 59,000, and the total population at 60,000. The civil population was divided as follows :— Under 1-2 2-5 5-10 10-15 Over 15 years. 1 year . years . years. years. years. Males. Females. 872 1,031 3,487 6,057 6,050 14,881 26,579 Possibly, the figures for males and females over 15 years of age may appear abnormal, having in view the fact that the number on military service was about 7,000, but they are quite consistent with the Census figures. The figures at the Census were:— Over 15 years .Under 5 years. 5-10 years. 10-15 years. Males. Female. 6,423 5,722 5,008 17,747 22,197 1918 5 With the exception of the age-period 5-10 years and, of course, the males over 15 years of age, the increase in the population has been curiously even. Under 5 years of age the increase was 19'3 per cent.; between 5 and 10 years, 6 per cent.; between 10 and 15 it was "20 per cent.; and in females over 15 years of age, 19'5 per cent. If the male population over 15 years of age had increased in the same ratio, it would show that 6,415 men were on active service. The Ward population in 1918 was as follows :— North East. North West. South East. South West. 15,367 12,209 15,091 16,290 There was an increase in the population of the three Wards—North East, North West, South East, and a decrease in the population of the South West Ward. There are two explanations for this phenomenon. At the Census the South West Ward was almost entirely built over, and any new buildings erected between 1911 and 1914 were in the other three Wards. But that is not the only reason, as the number of houses built between the Census and the beginning of the war was small. The increase is in the same ratio as the excess'of women over men at the Census in the different Wards as the following table shows:— ' Population at Census :— North East. North West. South East. South West. Male ... 6,732 4,919 6,651 8,083 Female 7,644 6, 573 7,948 8,798 There are other slight discrepancies between the figures supplied by the Registrar General and those given in this report. The difference between the two figures are very slight and it arises from different causes. Thus for the birthrate the Registrar General bases his figures upon the number of births registered in the district during the year, whilst I 1918 6 have given the number of births notified in the year, together with those registered in the year, but not notified. The Registrar General's figures is 965 and mine is 954. The Registrar General gives the number of deaths here in 1918 as 970 ; mj figure is 972. The possible explanation for this difference may be in the fact that I have included two deaths which occurred outside the district on December 28th and December 31st, 1917, and were not received in time for them to be included in the 1917 returns. There are many features of interest in the vital statistics. The birth-rate is the lowest on record, but the decrease as compared with 1917 is not a considerable one. In 1917 the birth-rate was 14 9, and in 1918 it was 14 5 per 1,000. The effect of the war was not made very manifest on the birthrate in Acton until 1917. There was a decreased rate of 1'8 per 1,000 in 1915 as compared with 1914, and a similar drop in 1916 as compared with 1915. In 1917 the birth-rate was 61 per 1,000 lower than in 1916. Since correct) records have been kept for the district the death-rate has, for the first time exceeded the birth-rate. The actual number of births registered was higher than the deaths credited to the district, but the death returns do not include the deaths of soldiers on active service, and the birth-rate is basrd on a higher population than the death-rate. The death-rate is the highest in the district since 190 >. The high death-rate is mainly due to the epidemic of Influenza. INFLUENZA. In the realm of public health the outstanding feature has l>een the virulent epidemic of Influenza which occurred in the autumn mouths. Two epidemics were experienced and although the summer one was extensive as regards number of cases, the mortality was not a high one. It is possible that in this district, the second epidemic wave did not attack so many persons as the first, but it produced more severe illness and a much higher fatality. From inquiries made in the large .factories in the district, the absentees on account of illness were in most instances greater in July than in October and 1918 7 November. In only one large factory did the absentees reach 10 per cent, of the total in the autumn, whilst several reached this figure in July. In one large factory the absentees reached barely 5 per cent, in the autumn and over 10 per cent, in the summer. In comparison with the autumn epidemic, the cases in the summer were comparatively mild. In the third quarter of the year only 9 deaths occurred, compared with 177 in. the last quarter. The difference in the type of disease possibly accounted for the fact that the doctors were not so overwhelmed with work in July as they were in October. In the summer epidemic most of the patients went to the doctor's dispensary, were sent home to bed for a couple of days and went back again on the third or fourth day. In the autumn epidemic the patients were so bad that they had to send for the doctor, or if they went to the dispensary they were sent home and visited. It may be stated roughly, that in this district the number of houses on a doctor's visiting list in the autumn epidemic would be three or four times the number in the summer one, but the number of cases seen in the surgery in the summer epidemic largely exceeded those seen under similar conditions in tho autumn one. It appears that this sequence of events usually follows in Influenza epidemics. The secondary wave is usually more virulent than the first. It is not my intention to discuss the various theories which have been advanced as to the cause of the outbreak. We have already been deluged with literature on the subject, and volumes will probably again be written on the causation of the late outbreak ; but a protest may be raised against some of the absurd theories which have been advanced and evidently very widely believed in. It is certain that no cause which is local in its operation can account for the origin of the disease. Some of the theories have been advanced by interested persons, and the press has been utilized to urge upon the Government measures which it is asserted, if adopted in time would have averted the epidemic. Some of the theories have been fantistic and ludicrous. The two theories which have obtained most 1918 8 credence were the food shortage and alcoholic shortage, more especially whiskey. It is not explained how these affected people in the most vigorous years of their lives. The universal prevalence of the disease is sufficient to refute these theories. Its name, as suggesting the country of its origin—Spanish Influenza, should have been sufficient to show that food regulations had no connection with its causation. Food and fruit have been plentiful in Spain during the war. No part of the earth seems to have escaped the epidemic. Countries far removed from the seat of war have suffered far more severely than this country has. South Africa suffered severely and in India the deaths were nearly five millions. In two islands of the Samoan group nearly '20 per cent, of the population succumbed ; out of a total population of 37,000 there were over 7,000 deaths. Severe as the outbreak was in this country its mortality bore no comparison with that of the epidemic in these countries. .From October 12th to December, 1918, the deaths in the 9G great towns registered as due to Influenza were 44,">37. These towns had a population of over 16$ million inhabitants and the death-rate was 269 per 100,000 inhabitants. ' Higher rates, over 400 per 100,000 occurred during thispeiiod in some of these great towns. The death-rate from Influenza in Acton during the same period was about 300 per 100,000 inhabitants. We are informed that this outbreak has been identical, both in itself and its complications, including pneumonia, with that in 1890. In view of this statement, it is interesting to look up the records of that epidemic in Acton and compare it with the present one. The epidemic made its appearance towards the end of December, 1889, and retained its virulence until the beginning cf 1890. During the height- of the epidemic the temperature of the air was alternately warm and cold, the earth saturated with moisture, and the atmosphere damp, foggyjand stagnant. No actual death occurred from Influenza itself, but it is probable that it was the primary cause of some deaths attributed to diseases of the respiratory organs. With the exception of the atmospheric conditions the former epidemic had very little in common with the present one. 1918 9 In the first quarter of 1918, no death occurred, and the district was almost free of the disease ; in the second quarter, a death which occurred on April '23rd was registered as due to the disease. Towards the end of June, a very extensive -outbreak occurred, and as previously stated some of the factories reported a higher percentage of absentees than in the autumn epidemic. The first death occurred on July 2nd, and 7 deaths occurred in July, 1 in August and 1 in September, the latter death occuring on September 6th. An interval of over one month elapsed before the next death occurred, 2 deaths occurring on October 9th and 2 on October 11th. The epidemic reached its height duriug the fir.it week in November and gradually subsided. The deaths in the remaining weeks of the year were as follows :— Week ending Oct. 19th 4 Week ending Nov. 30th 20 „ 26th 13 „ Dec. 7th 9 „ Nov. 2nd 35 „ 14th 10 „ 9th 35 „ 21st 2 „ 16th 20 „28th 1 „ „ „ 23rd 28 Of the total deaths 81 were,of males and 106 of females. When we consider the age-distribution of the deaths it will at once be evident that the disease was not more fatal in females than in males. As far as this district is concerned males suffered comparatively more severely than females. Age Distribution of the Deaths. Under 1 year 1—2 years. 2—5 years. 5—10 years. 10—15 years. 15—18 years. 18—25 years. Males 3 8 7 4 4 7 5 Females 0 2 7 6 10 1 17 25—30 years. 30—35 years. 35—40 years. 40—45 years. 45—50 years. 50—65 years. over 65 years. Males 5 7 11 6 3 7 4 Females 22 13 6 3 7 5 8 1918 10 Under the age of 18 there were 33 male deaths and 25 female. Between the ages 18 and 50 years there were 37 males and 68 females, and over the age of 50, 11 males and 13 females. The most fatal age-period was between the ages of 19 and 35 years. In that age-period 52 female deaths occurrred, or nearly one-half the total female deaths. The doctors practising in the district very kindly answered a series of questions which I asked them concerning their experience of the epidemic, and the opinions expressed here summarize the experience of almost all the doctors practising iu the district. There was no undue incidence of the disease amongst women except to the extent that there was an abnormal proportion of females living in the district between the ages of 15 and 45 years. One doctor with a very large practice stated that amongst his earlier cases 75 per cent, of them were boys between the ages of 8 and 12 years of age. Taking the epidemic as a whole there was a concensus of opinion that very young and old people escaped. There was a difference of opinion as to the incidence of the disease amongst the different occupations. Most of the doctors w£ie of opinion that indoor occupations suffered most severely, but the police surgeon on the other hand said that the constabulary suffered more severely in comparison than those employed in indoor occupations. There was an unanimous opinion that those who lived in overcrowded and ill-ventilated houses suffered most severely. At one large factory in July the munition workers extensively suffered, and the absentees averaged about 10 per cent, weekly, while the clerical staff escaped almost entirely, but in the autumn epidemic the munition workers escaped and seldom did the absentees number 2 per cent, in a week, but the clerical staff suffered severely, and over 75 per cent, of them were attacked. Laundry workers also were particulary liable to attack. Second attacks were comparatively rare. Most of the doctors stated that very few of those who were attacked in the 1918 11 summer suffered again in the autumn. Five doctors had had no cases in the autumn amongst, the patients who suffered in July, and all the other doctors stated that an attack in July in the vast majority of instances conferred an immunity and the patient did not suffer again in the autumn. When a second attack occurred the patients had always shewn a special tendency to suffer from Influenzal attacks. Contrary also to the usual experience in Influenza, relapses were rare; when a relapse did occur the initial attack was mild, but the relapse was of a more severe character. In the opinion of most of the doctors, the incubation period was a short one. In the majority of cases the incubation period was about two days, but undoubted instances of a period of only 36 hours were recorded and in other cases the incubation period was lengthened to five or six days. No opinion was expressed as to the effect of a shortened or lengthened incubation period upon the severity or otherwise of an attack. Most of the doctors also were cf opinion that the infectious period was a short one; probably less than a week from the onset of the initial symptoms. Evidently the most infectious period was during the early stages of the disease, and the disease was spread by coughing and sneezing, but these acts were not essential to its spread; even the act of speaking when in close contact was sufficient. Apart from lung complicatious the disease was not of long duiation, but where lung complications supervened, the duration of the disease, of course, depended on the nature of the complication. The lung complications varied considerably ; most of them were lobar pneumonia, or lobular pneumonia. A large number had congestion of the bases, but no consolidation. The most dreaded complication was a type of toxic pneumonia, where the patient died with all the symptoms of septicaemia aud the consolidation was slight. The lung complications occurred early and late and usually the most fatal cases were those where the lung symptoms appeared early. All the doctors complained of the lack of nursing facilities in the home. Private nurses were almost unobtainable, but 1918 12 even if it were possible to obtain private nurses it is doubtful if these would be available for the majority of the inhabitants. One doctor stated that the Deed was not so much of trained nurses, but of women who could visit the homes, clean up the house and sick rooms, make bids ard prepare food. In a large number of instances trained nursing was not absolutely essential. An instance was given of the difficulties met with. This doctor called in a certain house where 4 families lived. These families consisted of 14 members, and all the persons in the house were down with Influenza at the same time. Possibly, it would have been impossible to obtain skilled nursing for every case in the last epidemic, but much suffering would have been prevented if domestic helps working under a trained nurse had been available. Institutional treatment also waj entirely insufficient iu this district, but it- is doubtful if it would be possible to arrange for the institutional treatment of all those who require it in epidemics of an explosive character like Influenza. A selection of the cases could be made and early cases removed to hospital, especially where isolation of the patient could not be carried out in the home. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 674 cases of Infectious Diseases weie notified, but of these 417 were cases of Measles and German Measles and 149 Tuberculosis cases. ENTERIC FEVER. Only three cases were notified, but everyone proved fatal. In every instance, probably, the disease was contracted outside the district. SCARLET FEVER. In no year since the introduction of the notification of Infectious Diseases Notification Act, has the number of cases of Scarltt Fever notified been so low, and for the second successive year no death was recorded. The continued low incidence of Scarlet Fever throughout the country is encouraging, though an explanation is not readily forthcoming. 1918 13 Undoubtedly, the discussions which took place some years ago on the phenomena of the return case and the prolonged infection of some cases have proved of value. The causes of the return case were investigated and attention was focussed more upon the individual and less upon his belongings and surroundings. The importance of enlarged tonsils and adenoids and unhealthy nasal passages was recognised ; operative measures are being taken to remedy any unhealthy conditions of the upper respiratory passages; a strict examination is made of every convalescent child before resumption of school attendance. It is on these lines that success will probably be attained in the prevention of such diseases as Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria, and not upon the elaborate ritual of disinfection which has been observed in the past. During the past four years the amount of disinfection which we have carried out after Scarlet Fever has been reduced to a minimum. Formerly all the clothing and bedding were removed to the steam disinfector, the rooms were elaborately and systematically sprayed and fumigated. Now, we simply disinfect those articles which have been exposed to the infection of the fomites, and the fumigation done is more for the sake of obtaining a thorough cleansing of the room than with the object of destroying any pathogenic germs. An inquiry was carried out in Providence U.S.A., in 1903-1909, and Dr. Chapin, the Health Officer there, came to the conclusion that the elaborate disinfection which was carried out there was unnecessary. It is unfortunate that an inquiry on a large scale is not made by a central authority into the efficiency of disinfection as carried out by local authorities. Large sums of money are being spent annually, not only on disinfectants but also on labour. If a simpler method is sufficient, then a vast sum of money is unnecessarily spent by local authorities. Diphtheria. There is again a decrease both in the number of cases uotified and in the number of deaths. From an examination of the history of the disease in the district, fours years ago, I predicted that we were probably entering then on a period of minimum prevalence and we may expect this period to continue for another '2 or 3 years. For about 40 years the 1918 14 disease has exhibited very regular periods of maximum and minimum prevalence, these periods extending to about 7 years. One gratifying feature in this periodicity is the fact that the peak; tend to become flattened and the troughs to be more depressed. This is more particularly noticeable in the deathrate from the disease as compared with the case-rate, and is undoubtedly due to the introduction of anti-toxin. MEASLES AND GERMAN MEASLES. The Measles epidemic was a continuation of the epidemic which made its appearance late in 1917. TUBERCULOSIS. Although there is a slight decrease in the number of notified cases of Tuberculosis, there is an increase in the number of deaths. From Pulmonary Tuberculosis there were 91 deaths compared with 65 in 1917. For some years the death-rate from Pulmonary Tuberculosis has been on the increase,, but on inquiry into the methods of combating the disease is difficult owing to the dual control of the County and the local authority. ENCEPHALITIS LETHARGIC A. In the spring and early summer of 1918 cases of illness presenting a group of unusual cerebral symptoms occurred By some, the patients were said to be suffering from Botulism— a disease due to the consumption of food infected with the Bacillus botulimus of Van Ermengen. At a time of great difficulty with the food questions when some articles of food were rationed and others were of an inferior quality or difficult to obtain, this view attracted considerable attention, and sausages especially, were avoided by many people as an article of food. Inquiries were made by the Local Government Board, and it was soon established that food did not enter as a direct or an indirect factor in the causation of the disease. The disease has been described under different names, but it is now compulsorily notifiable as Encephalitis Lethargica. 1918 15 Last year the disease was not a notifiable one, but it is known that 5 cases occurred in this district, of which 1 was fatal. INFANTILE MORTALITY. 7(5 deaths occurred amongst infants under 12 months of age. ThiS( figure corresponds to an infantile mortality of 79 per 1,000 births. For 1917 there were 94 deaths and the infantile mortality was 96 per 1,000 births. On two previous occasions there has been a lower infantile mortality—in 1912 and 1916. The chief decrease was in deaths from Diarrhceal diseases. An examination of the Infantile Mortality Table will show that three-fourths of the deaths occurred from Respiratory diseases, Diarrhceal diseases and Developmental diseases. 252 of the babies born in 1918 attended the welfare centres, and of these 8 died, or a mortality of 32 per 1,000. It would not be fair, of course, to compare this figure with the infant mortality figure of the whole district. Only 80 or less than one-third of the babies attended the centre before they reached the age of one month. If we eliminate the deathfe of babies under one month the infantile mortality for the whole district was 51 per 1,000 births. If we eliminate the deaths under one month and take the babies who attended the centres and those who did not separately, the figures were 32 per 1,000 and 59 per 1,000, respectively. There are many other factors that should be taken into consideration when trying to estimate the value and the results of the work of the centres. The babies are drawn from districts which have shown a consistently high infantile mortality. On the other hand the mothers who bring their babies regularly to the centre are those who take an intelligent interest in their children, and this fact would counteract some of the deleterious conditions under which they live. Taking the figures of the district as a whole and comparing them with those of 20 years ago, the value of health visiting becomes at once apparent, and the results achieved have been immense.
