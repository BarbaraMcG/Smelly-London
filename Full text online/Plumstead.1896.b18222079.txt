Prepared in pursuance of Section 198 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855. For the Year ended 25th March, 1897. 1. Vestry's Marsh Land (purchased from Barth's Trustees).— An agreement has been entered into with the South Eastern Railway Company for:— (1) The exchange of small parts of the Vestry's land on the west side, with small parts of the Company's land adjoining. (2) The construction of a bridge, at the Company's expense, over White Hart Lane. 16 (3) The construction of a roadway under the bridge and through the Vestry's land, to the cost of part of which the Company will contribute half. (4) The construction by the Vestry of a sewer under the said road. (5) The filling in of the ditch, construction of fence and other matters. The exchange of land has been effected by deed, the Sewer has been sanctioned and a contract entered into for its construction, and directions have been given for fencing the new boundary and filling in the ditch. The diversion of the footpath to the site of the new road has been sanctioned by Quarter Sessions, and as soon as the sewer is put in the road can be made up and the Vestry's land fenced, which will then become ready for development by the erection of Mortuary, Disinfecting Shed, Stables, or other Parish purposes. 2. Vestry's Marsh Land, purchase of additional.—The greater portion of the Vestry's 25 acres of land purchased from Barth's Trustees being within 300 yards of houses and thus being ineligible for a Dust Shoot, and the major part of that which was outside the prescribed limit being let to the London County Council for Small Holdings, and there being urgent necessity for provision for disposal of the house refuse of this Parish and some land adjoining being in the market for sale, negotiations were opened with the owners (Goldsmid's Trustees) for the purchase of 25 acres, the whole of which was outside the limits referred to. The price asked was £110 per acre, but this was reduced after somewhat lengthy negotiations by the Vestry Clerk, to £90 per acre, at which 17 price the land was purchased; the purchase money was £2,280 and completed without a loan. The land lies east of and adjoins the land purchased from Barth's Trustees and abuts for the whole of its eastern boundary in Church Manorway, and for more than half of its northern boundary on to the London County Council's Sewer Road. The land is let temporarily to Mr. Cavey at £35 a year, and the ditch is being filled in on its southern side and a fence erected. 3. Tithe and Land Tax Redemption.—The Vestry on 3rd March, 1897, resolved to redeem the Tithe and Land Tax on the whole of its Marsh Land (50 acres) and this is being done. 4. Vestry Offices.—The Local Government Board were asked for information on the following points :— (a) If £1500 were paid to the Overseers for the purchase of their interest in the Vestry Offices, to what purpose would the money be appropriated ? (b) If the duties of the Overseers were transferred to the Vestry under Local Government Board's order, would the same premises become the property of the Vestry without any payment ? In reply to the first question the Local Government Board stated:— "That if the interest of the Parish in the Vestry Hall "were sold to the Vestry under Section 3 of the "Union and Parish Property Act, 1835, theproduce "of the sale would, under that Section, have to be "invested or applied, with the consent of the "Board, to some purpose for the permanent "advantage of the Parish 18 and with reference to the second question, "That if the Vestry were invested with the powers of a "Parish Council under Section 6 (1) c (ii) of the "Local Government Act, 1894, the Board might, "by their Order conferring such powers, make "Section 67 of that Act applicable if this appeared "desirable ; " but adding "That the Board would not be prepared to transfer to "the Vestry such of the duties of the Overseers as "are not, in the case of rural parishes, transferred "to the Parish Council." In reply to a further letter on the subject, the Local Government Board replied (15th October, 1896) that they would not transfer to the Vestry the power of making the Bates. 5. Bathing Lake, Plumstead Common.—The London County Council, after effecting several improvements to that end, have opened the Lake on Plumstead Common for Bathing during the summer months, and the privilege was taken full advantage of by some thousands of residents of East Plumstead, so much so, that the Vestry asked the Council to provide extra assistance during times of pressure. The formal opening took place on 4th July, 1896, the Ceremony being performed by Colonel Hughes, M.P., L.C.C., to whom the Vestry passed a cordial vote of thanks at the successful result of his efforts to secure this Bathing Lake. 6. Bostal Heath and Woods: Use of by Military.—The Vestry having been informed that the Military Authorities were applying to the London County Council for permission to 19 manoeuvre troops and fire blank cartridge at Bostal Heath and Wood, the Council were informed that, in the opinion of the Vestry it would be very undesirable, and strongly urging the Council not to sanction the application, to which a reply was received, dated 26th October, 1896, that the Parks and Open Spaces Committee had decided that it was not desirable to grant such permission. Major-General Maurice, C.B., Commanding the Woolwich District, however, asked permission to attend the Vestry to speak on the question, and this was granted. He accordingly attended the Vestry Meeting of 23rd December, 1896, and made a statement on the subject. He subsequently attended the General Purposes Committee, to whom the matter was referred for report. The Vestry, after very carefully considering the matter, passed the following Resolution:— "That the General Officer Commanding the Garrison at "Woolwich, as to his application to drill on Bostal Heath "and Wood, having expressed his willingness not to allow "any firing in Bostal Wood, and that the drill, notexceed"ing 12 times a year, shall be before noon, and not to be "on any general holiday, this Vestry do not oppose an "application made under these conditions, it being under"stood that this includes such mounted officers as are "necessary for Infantry Drill with Staff, but not Artillery "or Cavalry, and further that such consent being always "granted only during the pleasure of the Council; if any "damage should arise, the permission could always be "reconsidered. That a copy of this resolution be sent to "the London County Council, and to the General Officer "Commanding the Woolwich District." The matter is now engaging the attention of the London County Council. B 2 20 7. Bands, Bostal Health. —The Vestry applied to the London County Council to provide Bands at Bostal Heath during the summer of 1896, and the Council, as an experiment, sent a Band to play there on four Sunday evenings, which were stated by the Chief Officer of the Parks Department to have been so successful that arrangements had been made to supply Bands on Sundays during 1897. 8. Approach Road to Bostal Wood.—An agreement has, after considerable negotiation by the Vestry Clerk, been completed with Queen's College, Oxford, whereby the Council agree to convey to the Vestry, sufficient land to make a 40-ft. road from Wickham Lane, opposite King's Highway, to join the piece of land reserved by the Conveyance of Bostal Wood for the purpose of a Road to the Wood, the only consideration practically being that the Vestry should fence the road on either side. It has been sanctioned by the London County Council and named Waterdale Road, and besides complying with a condition of the conveyance of Bostal Wood, it will supply a very much needed shorter route to the wood from King's Highway. The Council have also agreed to contribute £239 10s. 0d. towards the cost of making the road. 9. Widening Wickham Lane.—After considerable correspondence extending back to the early part of 1893, an agreement has been entered into with Queen's College, Oxford, whereby they surrender sufficient land to widen Wickham Lane to 40 feet throughout, subject to the Vestry fencing off the adjoining land of the College, and making up the road and footpath. 10. Postal Arrangements—The Woolwich Postmaster in February, 1897, was applied to, asking for delivery of letters in Plumstead half-an-hour earlier in the morning so that they 21 might be received by workmen and others before they leave their homes, to which a reply was received dated 1st March, 1897 "That careful consideration has been given to the matter, "but it is regretted that it is not found practicable to "comply with their request for an earlier commence"ment of the morning delivery of letters in the district. "Such an alteration, besides involving considerable "additional cost, would necessitate the exclusion of an "important part of correspondence now delivered, and "the detention of these letters would cause serious in"convenience to the general Public." "An earlier despatch from London, was, in fact, tried "experimentally some time ago, but the change caused "so much delay of correspondence, and provoked so "many complaints from residents at Woolwich that it "had to be abandoned." 11. Ventilation of London County Council's Main Sewer.— The London County Council were petitioned in December to obtain the sanction of the War Department to construct two or more ventilating pipes from the main sewer in Plumstead Road and opening into the furnaces in the Royal Arsenal, which would tend to draw off a good deal of the sewer gas and thus obviate much of the nuisance at present prevailing, to which the Council replied (3rd March, 1897):— "That the Council's Main Drainage Committee have "endeavoured to obtain the consent of the War Depart"ment to the erection of ventilating pipes against some "of the furnace chimneys of the Royal Arsenal, but have "been informed there are no furnace chimneys to which "the connections from the sewer could be permitted, and 22 "that the Committee are endeavouring to obtain the "Department's consent to erect ventilating pipes against "the boundary wall of the Arsenal." 12. Levels of New Streets.—A question having arisen on Genesta Road, as to upon whom the responsibility rests for the violation of plans of new Streets in regard to their levels, a Deputation was appointed to wait upon the London County Council in regard thereto, and they were asked to receive such Deputation, but the Vestry were subsequently informed that the subject was engaging the attention of the Building Act Committee. 13. Action against Vestry for Gravel.—In January, 1897, Mr. R. Kersey instituted an action against the Vestry for £191 for gravel alleged to have been supplied. The Vestry successfully resisted this claim which Mr. Kersey abandoned. 14. East Plumstead Sewer: Allegations.—Mr. Martin, a Vestryman, having in open Vestry made some very serious statements as to the supervision and construction of the Bast Plumstead Sewer, viz. That it was badly laid, broken pipes and insufficient and defective concrete used and in some places mere gravel, and that the sewer having been laid in 9 inches of water could not be properly jointed; the Vestry appointed a Special Committee to investigate the allegations. The Committee met on four occasions. Mr. Martin indicated a length of sewer where a broken pipe would be found, and he alleged defective and insufficient concrete throughout the whole of the work, but stated that he would rely entirely on the first field between the Railway and the Sewer Road for the proof of his charges, and he promised to deposit with the Vestry Clerk the names of his informants. 23 The sewer was uncovered, in the presence of the Committee, in four places, three being on the length indicated by Mr. Martin. One of these three openings was 12 feet long, the others 6 feet long, and all had cross-sections to facilitate examination to the full depth of the work. The fourth opening was made to the south of the lamphole and was 6 feet long. The Committee and other Vestrymen descended Manhole No. 1, and inspected the sewer by aid of a light in the lamphole. The sewer appeared to be of excellent workmanship, and was in perfect order. The exterior of the sewer was also seen by examination in the openings to be without fault, being thoroughly encased in concrete of excellent quality, samples of which were taken, and of the requisite thickness everywhere. There was no leakage, no evidence of flaw, or any imperfection whatever. Mr. Martin also examined the sewer inside and out, and expressed himself "perfectly satisfied," adding that he was surprised to find the work so well done. The Committee reported to the Vestry that the East Plumstead Sewer had been well and properly laid, and that Mr. Martin's allegations to the contrary were disproved. The names given by Mr. Martin, as being his informants, were "Leegood" and "Pollard," but on being pressed, Mr. Martin stated that he was not acquainted with the Christian names and addresses of these two informants ; he promised, however, to obtain particulars and endeavour to produce the two men before the Committee, but this he failed to do, and the Vestry, on the recommendation of the Committee, passed the following Resolutions, viz.:— 24 (a) "That Mr. Charles Martin having, on vague and unreliable "rumours, made statements in public Vestry, casting "unfounded reflections upon the Vestry and its officials "in alleging that the East Plumstead Main Sewer was "laid without proper supervision, that the sewer was "badly laid, that broken pipes were used, that mere "gravel was used instead of concrete, and that the "pipes were not properly jointed, whereas, on the sewer "being opened in the presence of your Committee and "Mr. Charles Martin, it was found to be perfectly "sound and well laid; he be called upon to pay the "expenses incurred in making the inspection, which "was necessary to disprove his charges, the amount "being £7 10s. 3d." (which, however, he did not pay). "That Mr. Charles Martin having in open Vestry, and "upon mere hearsay evidence, made a series of "damaging charges against the Vestry and its officers, "which charges he has utterly failed to substantiate, "and which, upon investigation, have proved to be "thoroughly false and unfounded, it be therefore "resolved that Mr. Charles Martin is unfitted any longer "to be a member of any Committee of the Vestry, and "that his name be removed from the Public Health "Committee." "That the Vestry convey to its Surveyor, Mr. W. C. Gow, "and the Clerk of the Works, Mr. E. C. Saville, its "complete satisfaction with the results of the inspection "made of the East Plumstead Main Sewer, and com"pliment them upon the thorough excellence of the "work, and the careful supervision exercised by them "during its construction, assuring them that they retain " the Vestry's entire confidence." 25 15. East Plumstead Sewer Connections.—The Vestry, by resolution dated 11th November, 1896, put into operation Sec. 59 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1862, in regard to this Sewer, and directed— "That the connection of all new properties with the East "Plumstead Sewer which has been made at the cost of "the owners and occupiers of the particular land included "in each special benefit rate, be in future granted only "on condition of the owners of such new properties "paying one contribution of 5s. in the £ on the rateable "value of the property erected where the rate levied has "been equal to or exceeded 5s. in the £, and where the "rate is less than 5s., one contribution of the same "amount as the special rate; and that this contribution "be made in respect of all houses now or hereafter built "in the special area not included in the special rate; "such contributions to be carried as a separate fund to "the account of the precept, and surpluses to be pro"portionately divided (as often as sufficient surpluses "arise) between the original contributors as a refund on "the rates paid by them." 16. East Plumstead Sewer, Special Precepts.—Of the total cost of this sewer, viz.: £3,588 3s. 6d., the Vestry contributed £1,001 13s. 10d., which was paid out of a loan from the London County Council raised for that purpose. Seven Special Precepts were issued to the Overseers for amounts making up the balance, viz: £2, 586 9s. 8d., the Vestry being of opinion that the expenditure was incurred for the special benefit of the particular parts to which the Precepts related, and directions were given to levy the amounts on the areas shewn on the plans accompanying the Precepts. 26 17. Special Precepts: Bostal Lane and Abbey Wood Sewers. —The legality of these Kates have now been finally established in the Court of Appeal, and nearly the whole of the amount of Bostal Lane Precept has been paid to the Vestry, and the whole of the Grove Road and Abbey Grove Precept has been paid. 18. Abbey Wood Sewer Connections.— Five Shillings in the £ on the rateable value of two houses belonging to Mr. J. J. Daniels, and built since the Special Precept was made has been paid, and will be collected on future new houses using the Bostal Lane Sewer. 19. Special Precept: River Wall.—In March, 1897, the Vestry issued a Special Precept to the Overseers of Plumstead for the sum of £394 17s. 11d., the amount required for repairs of the River Bank and Flood Protection Works, and directed that the same be charged exclusively on the area known as the North Marsh District, including the railway and the land and property north of the same. 20. Harrow Manorway Sewer.—Application was made to the London County Council to allow the houses in Harrow Manorway on the West side to be drained into the Sewer inasmuch as they were erected before the Sewer was constructed or sanctioned, and ought to be treated as exceptional cases, but the Council declined to vary the condition on which this Sewer was sanctioned, that no connections should be made thereto, north of the railway. 21. Ward Census.— From a Return made by the London County Council of a Census taken in March, 1896, of the Population in the several Wards into which certain Parishes 27 of London have been divided, it appears that the population of the various Wards in Plumstead was as follows:— North 5,329 North-East 5,651 North-West 5,289 South 8,952 South-East 10,646 South-West 7,152 East 11,011 West 5,222 Total 59,252 22. Mortgage paid off.— A Mortgage with the Eoyal Exchange Assurance Corporation for £3000 at 5 per cent, interest, borrowed for sewerage purposes on 5th December, 1866, has been paid off, the final payment having been made on 5th December, 1896. 23. Bye-Laws, Street Cries, &c.—The Vestry passed a resolution on 11th November, 1896, in favour of the London County Council dealing by Bye-Law with nuisances as to street cries; galleries, roundabouts, and street organs; lights to vehicles after sunset; and the keeping of noisy animals— and the Council were so informed. The St. Pancras Vestry were also informed of the action taken, in reply to a letter on the subject. 24. Telephone.—Extension sets of Instruments have been fitted in the Surveyor's and Public Health Offices, so that now each of the departments are not only in telephonic communication with each other, but can also communicate direct to the Exchange, from their own office. 28 25. Bye Laws.— The Bye Laws and Regulations of the Vestry without the appendices were reprinted in a small book for the use of Vestrymen. 26. Burial Board Members.—The Members of the Burial Board who retired in June, 1896, were Messrs. T. A. Bishop, W. Kemp and R. Johnson, and Messrs. T. A. Bishop, W. Kemp and W. T. Farmer were elected for three years. 27. Baths Commissioners—The Baths Commissioners who retired in June, 1895, were Messrs. E. Kemp, P. Pringle, and Mills, and there was 3 vacancies. No action was taken to elect Commissioners for the ensuing 3 years, and there was therefore 6 vacancies. 28. Suvimonses.—113 Summonses have been issued and heard at Woolwich Police Court, as set out on page 33. 29. Contracts, &c.—54 Contracts, Agreements, and Conveyances have been entered into, a list of which will be found on pages 90-99, with the audited accounts. 30. Widening High Street.— A very much needed improvement is being effected in High Street at what was formerly its narrowest part, viz. : between Nos. 34 and 98, Its greatest width between these two points, inclusive of footpaths was formerly 48 feet, and its narrowest 32 feet 10 inches, but it will now be 64 feet at its widest and 41 feet 9 inches at its narrowest. The improvement has cost the parish for the purchase of the various interests the comparatively small sum for so large an undertaking, of £1662 11s. 3d , involving as it did the entire demolition of one house and the partial demolition of two others. There were numerous interests to be 29 negotiated and dealt with involving the preparation and completion of 20 conveyances or agreements, and the whole matter so far as the acquisition of these varied rights were concerned was completed within the short space of four months from the date of the Vestry's Resolution of 20th January, 1897, sanctioning the improvement, notwithstanding some of the owners were abroad. It is also satisfactory to note that in no case was it found necessary to go to a jury to settle the compensation, although formal notices were served in some instances. The London County Council have promised a contribution of half the total cost of the improvement, such half not to exceed £1213. 31. High Street Improvement at Churchyard.— The Clause in the London County Council's General Powers Bill, 1896, as to the widening of High Street, next to St. Nicholas' Churchyard, having been passed into law, the Vestry, under Section 6, and under its common Seal, forwarded a request to the Council to transfer to the Vestry all its powers of purchasing and taking land for this purpose, which request the Council acceded to, and the Vicar and Churchwardens having signed an Agreement for the sale of such land (i.e., sufficient to make the Road 60 feet wide), in consideration of the wall and railing being erected by the Vestry. Tenders were invited for the work, and the improvement has now been effected. Application was made to the Council to pay part of the estimated cost of the improvement, which the Council has agreed to do, not exceeding £599. 32. Other Improvements.— Station Road, Abbey Wood, has been widened on the Erith side, so as to make it 40 ft. wide 30 from the Railway Station to Harrow Road, the Vestry contributing £25 towards the cost of the purchase of the necessary land by Erith District Council. Projecting Forecourts in front of Nos. 160, 162, 164 & 166, Plumstead Common Road, were purchased at a cost of £90 (towards which the Council agreed to contribute £45), and the Road widened there, at what was one of its narrowest points. The Vestry paid the Vicar and Churchwardens £78 for a piece of land in front of St. Margaret's Church, and a footpath has now been formed in front of the Church, where none previously existed, in continuation of the footpath in Blendon Road, and joining the footpath of Vicarage Park. A new iron fence and gates has been erected to the altered line, by the Vicar and Churchwardens. The London County Council have agreed to contribute £25 towards this improvement. Improvements have been effected at the junction of Wickham Lane and High Street. Mr. E. Proctor was paid £24 13s. 4d. for sufficient land at the north-west corner of Wickham Lane to make Wickham Lane 40 ft. wide as far as Hogtrough Lane, and Mr. E. Kemp was paid £22 for a strip of land in front of his shops at the north-east corner, and the land in each of these cases has been added to the public way. A much needed improvement has been effected in Herbert Road, by the fencing in of the vacant land or bank in front of Herbert Terrace. The land being appurtenant to the houses and premises in Herbert Terrace, by the owners of which property the cost was paid with the aid of a contribution from the Vestry, and the opportunity was taken of throwing a small piece of the land, at each end, into the footpath, for which allowances from their contributions were made to the owners concerned. 31 33. Alteration of Bye-Laws.—The following alterations of Bye-law have been made and sealed during the year:— Bye-law 261, as to workmen's sick pay, altered:—By adding after the word "Certificate," at the end of the first paragraph, the words "such Certificate to be renewed fortnightly." By omitting all words after the word "allowed" in the second line of the second paragraph, and substituting the following: "After 1 and under 2 years' service, not "exceeding 2 weeks; after 2 and under 3 years' service, "not exceeding 3 weeks; after 3 years' service, not "exceeding 4 weeks. Not to exceed four weeks in any "one year, except for men with 7 years' service and up"wards whose cases shall be specially considered by the "Committee." By omitting all words after the word "work" in the third line of the third paragraph, and substituting the following: "They shall receive full pay for not exceeding one month "after which the continuance of the same, or part thereof "must be specially considered by the Committee." Bye-law 173, as to Working Balance, altered by omitting "£1000," and inserting instead, the words " not less than "£1000 nor exceeding £3000." 34. Valuation of Government Property .-—The. Valuation of Government property in this Parish, on which the Government Grant is made, has been increased to £38,520, being an increase of £14,876. At the end of the year the Overseers had commeneed to issue summonses against persons who had not paid the rate, and were so far successful as to obtain for payment 32 35, George Webb Memorial Fountain.— A Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough has been erected at the Slade, in front of the Old Slade School, in memory of the late Mr. George Webb, for many years a Member of the Vestry, and Representative at the old Plumstead District Board. The cost was defrayed mainly by public subscriptions, but the Vestry put in the foundations, and erected a lamp on top, and undertook the maintenance, lighting, and water supply. 36. Plumstead Charities, Public Enquiry.—The Report of Mr. Andrew C. Kay, Assistant Charity Commissioner, embodying the result of the Public Enquiry held by him in December, 1895, in regard to Plumstead Charities, was published in July, 1896, and a copy supplied to each Vestryman. EDWIN HUGHES, Vestry Clerk. June, 1897. 33 Vestry Clerk's Report on Police Court Proceedings, 1896-7. The following Summonses have been issued on behalf of the Vestry, and heard at the Woolwich Police Court during the year ended 25th March, 1897. Particulars were reported to the Vestry in each case at the time. Nature of Summons. Summonses. Convictions or Orders. Work done or cause of action removed before hearing.

Road Material, Landing of—The landing of Material at Strother's Wharf has worked satisfactorily, and the Contract has been renewed for a further period of two years. I have unloaded a few cargoes of material at the Royal Arsenal Wharf to keep open the privilege, many years since granted by the War Office. 6. Licenses for Hoardings and Trench Openings —I have issued licenses for 132 Trench openings and 17 Hoardings, and the following sums have been charged for openings. South Metropolitan Gas Co. £412 5 2 Kent Water Works 10 9 7 General Post Office 3 12 0 The "penny in the slot" system of the Gas Company has not been the cause of so many openings in this as last year. 7. Cartage. —The team labour has been supplied by Mr. Lonergan under contract. A new contract is being advertised for, as from the 1st July next; the Vestry have adopted the principle of keeping its own horses, and plans for stables on the Vestry's Marsh Land are in course of preparation. 8. The average number of horses and carts employed per day in removal of street refuse, deposit from gullies, and other general work (exclusive of cartage of road material) has been 1st quarter 23 2nd ,, 23 3rd ,, 18 4th „ 19 average for the year being 21 per day. The cost of horse hire for the year has been £3290 10s. 1d. inclusive of cartage of material and watering. 39 9. Labour.— The greatest number of men employed during the year, not including the office staff, has been 109, the least has been 73, average 91. As the parish extends this may naturally be expected to further increase. The men had their Annual Beanfeast on 12th Sept., 1896. 10. Relief Labour.—Owing to the mildness of the season, men were only employed on Belief Labour for two days, at a cost of £6 6s. 0d. 11. Steam Roller.—The Steam Roller, purchased in 1889 at a cost of .£380, has been thoroughly overhauled and repaired by the makers at a cost of £102 17s 0d , and is now in good condition. There is a spare pair of wheels in store. When lent on hire the roller is charged for at the rate of 38s. a day. The boiler is insured for £300. The purchase of a second roller at an approximate cost of £450 has been approved. This will have a scarifier, for use in the breaking up of the roads. Quotations have been received and the matter is under consideration. 12. Disinfecting Apparatus.—No progress has yet been made towards the provision of a new disinfecting house on the Marsh land, pending the construction of new road from White Hart Lane. The apparatus in use is of old pattern. A new boiler was recently purchased from Marshall & Son, Gainsborough, and is insured for £100. 13. Watering.— The watering has been done under the contract for Horse Hire, the Vestry providing the necessary 40 vans and carts. A new water van of a special pattern (Willacy's Patent) has been purchased at a cost of £47 10s. Provision is made in the estimate 1897-8 for auother van, it being necessary that this plant should be increased as the Parish extends. 14. The water was supplied by the Kent Water Company at a cost of £662 10s. 0d. 15. The number of water vans is 16. „ „ carts is 5. 16. The number of days watering in the year has been 127. 17. The positions of hydrants are shewn on the 12-inch watering map. The present number is 56, seven having been provided and fixed during the past year. 18. With the exception of some small amount of wheeler's work, the whole of the repairs to carts, vans and hydrants, as also the painting, have been done by direct labour, by the Vestry's workmen, with efficiency and economy. We have tried some of Stirratt's Patent Skidpans for the water vans, and they have given satisfaction. Notices have been fixed in several places cautioning drivers as to improper skidding on the steeper hills, which causes much damage to the roadway. 19. Lighting.—The lighting of the District, has been carried out by the South Metropolitan Gas Company. During the year 14 additional lamps have been fixed, and 9 moved, at an aggregate cost of £32 15s. 1d. With a view to furnishing report on an improved system of street lighting, more particularly in Plumstead Road and High 41 Street, I Lave been making somewhat exhaustive trials with incandescent lighting, especially in regard to the wear of the mantles, and hope soon to be able to recommend the adoption of the system. I do not advise early action, as the question is under the anxious consideration of experts, so that further improvements may be looked for. 20. New Lamvs.—The following is the position of the several new lamps which have been fixed during the year. Barnfield Place 1 Vernham Road 2 Sladedale Road 2 The Avenue 1 Princes Road 1 Hull Place 1 Grove Road 1 Abbey Grove 1 Congo Road 1 Old Park Road 1 Lee Street Passage 1 The Slade 1 14 21. Removal of lamps to new positions:— Acacia Parade 1 Bostall Hill 2 High Street 1 Parkdale Road 1 Kashgar Road 1 Sandy Hill Road 1 Wrottesley Road 1 The Slade 1 9 42 22. The oil lamp at Bleak Hill, is lighted by a resident in the neighbourhood, at cost of £3 3s. 0d. per annum inclusive. 23. The total number of street lamps, including 129 long distance lamps, 3 obelisk lamps, and lamp at Bleak Hill now is 645. The Total Cost of Lighting has been £2020 16s. 6d. as against £1971 5s. 4d. for the previous year. The gas is tested by the London County Council, and result furnished weekly. 24. Harrow Manorway, Station Road, and Knee Hill, are lighted with gas under agreement dated 20th Dec., 1894, with the Erith District Council. 25. Dusting.—The collection of dust has been carried out, under contract, by Mr. Bowtell, for the sum of £1210. It has been decided to call for fresh tenders for this work from 30th June, 1897. The pail system is now in force in the whole District and appears to work satisfactorily. Additional land on the Marshes has been acquired for a dust shoot. 26. Renumbering of Streets.—Under orders issued by the London County Council, notices have been served for the renumbering of the following streets, viz., Anglesea Road, Canlwell Road, Conway Road, Priuces Road, and Richmond Place. The following has been renamed, Constitution Hill now Westdale Passage. The names of such streets as become defaced are repainted from time to time as necessary. 27. Ventilating Shafts.—With a view to the ventilation of the sewers, ventilating columns or shafts have been erected in the following positions:— 43 Name of Road. Shafts. Columns. Marmadon Road One (west end) - Crescent Road One do. - Do. One (east end) - Church Terrace (St. James' Church) One (west end) - Majendie Road One - Brewery Road One - Reidhaven Road — One Junction of Eton Road and Burrage Rd. — One Burrage Road (opposite No. 70) — One Do. (south end) One Graydon Street (south end) One Vernham Road (South end) — One Plumstead Common (top of Park Road) — One Chesnut Road (south end) — One Leghorn and Tuscan Roads — One Coxwell Road (centre) One On the 13th June, 1897, I reported to the Works Committee as regards the result of the trial in ventilation of the Burrage Road sewer, and although subsequent to the 25th March. 1897, I was directed to embody the same in this annual report, as follows:— "The scheme reported on by me on the 3rd March, 1896, "has been carried out with the exception of the fresh"air inlets, as there are some old surface gratings "which I have found acting as fresh-air inlets, and "the alterations up till now are working exceed"ingly well. I would also like to mention that an "official from the Engineer's Department of the London "County Council has called upon me with reference to "my mode of sewer ventilation, and I anticipate that the "Council will ventilate their outfall sewer in a similar "manner. If this be so, it will save much expense in the "ventilation of sewers in this district. Other Surveyors "of sanitary authorities have also been to gain similar "information. I pronounce the scheme a success." 44 28. List of Roads and Sewers.— The following is a list of the Roads and Sewers in the Parish, and their length, and showing Roads taken over by the Vestry.

Marsh Ditches.—The following table shows the sums that have been expended during the past five years in connection with the Marsh ditches, in regulating slopes, dragging, casting-out mud, repairing drains, sluices, &c.: £ s. d. 1892-3 1893-4 1894-5 1895-6 1896-7 225 263 292 273 251 3 19 0 0 13 0 4 7 3 1 Under instructions, I reported generally on the Marsh ditches, on the 4th March, 1896, as follows:— "With reference to your memo. of the 5th February last, "re the contamination with human excreta of the water "accessible to cows in the Marsh ditches, I beg to report "that, in company with the Chief Sanitary Inspector, I "have inspected the Marsh ditches, and find that with "regard to the one between the football ground and ' The " Sportsman' B.H., there is no overflow from any cess" pool into it, but a large heap of manure is within a few " yards of the edge of the ditch and drains into it. "There are some piggeries in rear of ' The Sportsman,' and "the owner is about to construct a cesspool to receive the "drainage of these. I recommend that this cesspool be "kept under observation when constructed, and that the "manure heap be removed from its present position to a "place where no risk will be run of its draining into the "ditch. "The ditch abutting on plot 43 on the Marsh plan is in a "bad state, owing to the regular flow round having been "stopped by the Arsenal authorities filling in the ditch on 53 "the north side of this plot, during the construction of "the new proof-butts. I recommend the Arsenal authori"ties be called upon to thoroughly cleanse the ditch and "put in a trunk at a point about 300 feet from the east "corner of the Manorway, thus establishing a flow round "the ditches. "The ditch from this point running eastward and then north"ward to 'L' on the Marsh plan also requires thoroughly "cleansing, and the owners should be called upon to re"construct the existing trunk, which is practically useless, "at a point about 150 feet from the Arsenal tramway "road. "Previously to the construction of the East Plumstead "sewer, overflows undoubtedly took place into the stream "which crosses at the end of High Street, but inasmuch "as the cesspools all along the valley line have been "abolished, I consider there is now little or no danger of "the water becoming contaminated with human excreta. "There is a storm overflow or relief sewer from Lakedale "Road sewer which runs dowu White Hart Lane under "the railway, and is connected to the ditch at the west "side of the Vestry's land. This relief sewer should only "act in times of flood, but it was found to be acting a few "weeks ago in dry weather, the reason being that about a "barrowful of rags had got into the Lakedale Road sewer "at the junction where the overflow takes place. "How the rags came to be there I have not found out. "The foreman has received strict injunctions to keep a "watch on this overflow in future. "I cannot recommend doing away with the overflow, as the "Southern outfall iu times of storm backs up the High "Street sewer." 54 33. River Bank.—The cost of repairs during the past year has been £362 16s. 3d. I may mention that the keeping of the River Bank in proper repair, is compulsory on the Vestry, under Act of Parliament, to prevent flooding in the low-lying parts of the Parish. It is impossible to say what these repairs may cost from time to time; a vessel running into the bank may cause considerable damage, and its name not be ascertained; an exceptionally high tide with strong wind, may do the same; the wall is furthermore considerably weakened by the incursion of rats, and the only way to avoid risk, is to carry out repairs promptly and efficiently as necessity arises. The Highways Sub-Committee have, during the past year, taken very great interest in this particular work, and made frequent inspections of such repairs as were considered necessary, before commencement and on completion. It is my intention to bring up a report as to widening the Bank from end to end in a similar manner to what was done some four years since, by the late District Board of Works. 34. New Sewers.—Applications have been received for the construction of the following sewers:— Road. Size of Sewer. Length in feet. Applicant. Nithdale Road inches. 1310 H. H.

Combined Drainage.—Stoppages of combined drains have been reported on, attended to, and repaired as follows. The cost of repairs to all such drains has to be borne by the Parish, in all cases where plans for the drainage cannot be found in the office. Sutcliffe Road, No. 12 to 30 Herbert Road, No. 59 to 61 56 Reidhaven Road, No. 2 to 8 Hanover Road, No. 2 to 28 Reidhaven Road, No. 78 to 90 Frederick Place, No. 10 to 13 Vicarage Road, No. 59 to 61 Bipon Eoad, No. 10 to 18 Plumstead Common Road, No. 124 to 132 Parkdale Road, No. 31 to 37 Chesnut Road, No. 90 to 96 Burrage Road, No. 17 to 21 Salisbury Cottages, No. 1 to 6 Glyndon Road, No. 9 to 19 Eeidhaven Road, No. 54 to 76 Sydney Cottages, Reidhaven Road, No. 1 to 2 Burwash Road, No. 33 to 47 Gossage Road, No. 3 to 5 St. Thomas' Cottages, Princes Road Earl Street, No. 54 to 60 Kentmere Road, No. 11 to 15 Bramblebury Road, No. 17 to 33 Coupland Terrace, No. 23 to 29 Crescent Road, No. 146 to 148 Hartville Road, No. 28 to 36 Brewery Road, No. 4 to 16 Chesnut Road, No. 4 to 16 Liffler Road, No. 5 to 13 Garland Street, No. 37 to 43 Elm Street, No. 63 to 71 Plumstead Road, No. 28 to 32 Sandbach Place, No. 9 to 11 37. Cesspools.—Most of the cesspools in the Parish have now been abolished. Those at Bleakhill, Southland Road, Heath Villas, and Bostal Terrace, Bostal Hill, and also those at Shooters' Hill, will soon cease to exist, when the drainage schemes now under consideration are carried into effect. 57 38. Urinals.—The following List shows the number and situation of the whole of the Urinals in the Parish accessible to the public. There are 39 of them, viz.— Situation Name. Remarks. Middle Gates Helen Street Burrage Grove Queen's Arms Maxey Road Windsor Castle Charles Street Crown and Sceptre Bloomfield Road Freemasons' Arms St. James' Place Melbourne Arms St. Margaret's Road Prince of Wales Herbert Road Lord Herbert Shooters' Hill Red Lion Shrewsbury Lane The Bull Princes Road Royal Oak Barnfield Road Lord Bloomfield Richmond Place Star and Garter Thomas Street Railway Tavern Griffin Road Lord Derby Walmer Road Walmer Castle Abbey Wood Abbey Arms High Street Rose and Crown Do.

Superintendent's Lodge For Ladies only Raglan Road Lord Raglan Maxey Road Percy Arms Plumstead Common Road The Ship All these urinals (except the one marked*) are cleansed by the Parish twice daily, and once on Sundays. 58 Convictions have been obtained in two instances for fouling urinals. Plan was prepared for improvement of urinal at Inverness Arms, respecting which complaints had been made owing to its position with regard to the Board School, but proposed alterations fell through. 39. Fire Alarms.—Fire Alarms are fixed at the following places, and electrically connected with the Fire Engine Stations:— 1. Plumstead Railway Station. 2. Maxey Eoad, corner of Raglan Road. 3. Plumstead Common Road, corner of Bloomfield Road. 4. Brent Road, corner of Eglinton Road. 5. Shrewsbury Lane, corner of Shooters' Hill. 6. Park Road, corner of Warwick Terrace. 7. Bostal Lane, corner of Grove Road. 8. Wickham Lane, corner of High Street. The Fire Escape is kept at Plumstead Railway Station during the night, and at the Marsh Gates, Royal Arsenal, during the day. 40. New Streets.—The following New Streets have been made up during the year:—Bostal Hill (part), Ceres Road, High Street (extension), Kashgar Road, Lee Street Passage, Piedmont Road, and Salisbury Cottages. No extra assistance was called in for this work. 41. Forge.—We still continue to carry out all the smith's work by direct labour, with much economy and satisfaction. 59 My department is thereby saved much delay iu giving instructions and superintending the work, which would be necessary if done by an outside contractor. 42. Carpenter's Work.—We are now employing a man permanently on carpenter's work. The saving involved by this is considerable, as he carries out repairs to water vans and carts, slop and tar carts, wheelbarrows and other plant, which has hitherto been given out to private firms at a much greater cost. 43. Vestry Stock.—Particulars of the Vestry's stock to the 25th March, 1897, have been taken, and value of same is estimated as follows:— £ s. d. Carts, Vans, Steam and other Rollers, Tools, Disinfecting Apparatus, Materials, &c. 2544 15 6 Levels, Staffs, Chains, Tapes, &c. 189 10 0 £2734 5 6 The Stock Account will be laid before the Finance Committee for audit, under Bye-Law 156 (5), in due course. The value of the stock during the past five years has been as follows:— 1893 £2856 14 4 1894 2870 18 11 1895 2790 0 10 1896 2665 11 0 1897 (present year) 2734 5 6 60 44.

The old hedge was grubbed up, and the road widened to a width of 60 feet, which I consider, will when completed, be one of the best improvements ever made in the Parish. The contract is being carried out in part by Messrs. Thomas and Edge, the path on the north side (of Adamant Stone) by Messrs. Fry Bros., the path and kerb on the south side by direct labour, the flagging and kerb being supplied by the latter firm. 50. Roof Water discharging on Footpaths.—We are still continuing to carry channel pipes across the footpaths, instead of allowing the water to discharge direct on to the path, the owners supplying the pipe, which the Vestry fixes free of cost. This only applies to old property, all new property being connected with the drainage system. 51. Tar Paving Repairs.—Extensive repairs to tar-paving in old roads have been carried out during the year. 1 may observe that many of the paths, have, from time to time, been repaired with old material worked up in our own yard, this does not wear satisfactorily, and if the paths are to be kept in proper repair, many will require to be taken up, relaid, and coated with Kentish rag topping. 52. Gullies.—Several new pot gullies have been put in, and many old brick gullies reconstructed. By standing order the old pattern stone when damaged is taken up and replaced with a channel grating. 53. Marsh Land.—A wooden fence has been erected by Mr. Cavey, on a schedule of prices, on the southern boundary of the land recently acquired on the Marshes for a dust shoot. 54. Health Refuge.—Plans have been prepared and 64 tract entered into with Mr. E. Proctor for the erection of p. building, consisting of eight rooms and accessories, on the Vestry's land, Parkdale Road, for use as a Health Refuge. 55. Plumstead Common Surface Water.— At the request of the London County Council the surface water from the Common, previously discharging into the Bathing pond, was diverted by means of a 9-in. pipe into the Lakedale Road sewer. The work was carried out by the Vestry's workmen, the London County Council contributing towards the cost. A storm overflow chamber was constructed at the point of diversion, so that in times of excessive rain, the old length of sewer would act as a relief sewer. 56. White Hart Lane.—Plans have been prepared, in conjunction with the Engineer, South-Eastern Railway Company, under an agreement, for the lowering of White Hart Lane, and the construction of a road northward to the Crossness Sewer Road, and also for the deviation of the White Hart Lane storm overflow, to be carried under this road and connected with the outfall. 57. Cmpland Terrace.—Plans have been prepared for the better drainage of Coupland Terrace, and provision for the work is made in the Estimates 1896-7. 58. Southland Road Sewer.—A new length of sewer has been put in from Wickham Lane along Southland Road, and notices served on owners to connect. 59. St. Margaret's Church Improvement.— Arrangements have been made with the Vicar and Churchwardens of St. Margaret's Church, for setting back and finishing off in a curved line from the corner of the adjacent property to the entrance gate, the railing in front of St. Margaret's Church. A lump sum will be paid by the Vestry for this work on its being carried out to my satisfaction. 65 60.— Underground Conveniences.—Several suggestions have been brought forward for the construction of underground conveniences, and plans were prepared for the construction of such a building partly on the property of the South Eastern Eailway Company at Plumstead Bridge, but the Company declined to surrender the site, and that project fell through. Fresh plans are now being prepared for a Convenience at the junction of Walmer Road and High Street. 61. Chesnut Road Yard.—A water closet for the use of the workmen has been erected here, and the old earth closet removed. A ventilating shaft was also erected on the iron shed, which helps to relieve the Chesnut Road Sewer. 62. Hanover Road Sinkage.—A serious sinkage took place over the main sewer at the north end of Hanover Road, and was made good and reported on at the time. 63. Road Foreman.—The Road Foreman, West District, having obtained another appointment, quitted the service of the Vestry on 7th January last, and after advertisements, Mr. J. T. Price from Worthing, was appointed in his place. 64. Minor Works.—Amongst others, I would mention the following Minor Works which have been carried out during the year:— Shooters' Hill—repairs to footpaths. Shrewsbury Lane—do. Eglinton Road—crossing. St. John's Road—do. Robert Street—do. Frederick and St. James' Place—do. Princes Road—regulating kerb and channel. Plumstead Common Road—do. Herbert Terrace—do. Nithdale Road—kerb and crossing. Vicarage Road—channels E 66 Bloomfield Road—sinkage. Ann Street—do. Slade, near "Woodman" P.H.—kerb and paved path. Little Bartletts— posts in lieu of stile. Almshouses, Park Road—sewer connection. Wickham Lane, Proctor's Corner— improvement. Vestry Hall— improved ventilation. Public Health Offices— alterations. Surveyor's Offices— glass roof to passage. Do.— press for plans. 65. Conclusion.— I desire to record my sincere thanks to the whole of my Staff for the energy and forethought they at all times display in assisting me in carrying out the arduous duties of such a growing Parish, and I mournfully wish to mention the sad loss, after a lingering illness, of a bright and promising young man (H. Eardley Vincent, my articled pupil), who I am sure, had he been spared, would have been an ornament to the profession he had chosen. To the Officers of the other Departments I have again to express my thanks for their ready help at all times. To the Chairman and ViceChairman (Colonel Richardson, J.P., and Joseph Harper, Esq.) of the Vestry, and the Chairman and Vice-Chairman (.T. R. Jolly, Esq., J.P., and H. W. Jones, Esq.) of the Works Committee, and many other members of the Vestry, I beg to tender my sincere thanks for their kindly help in assisting me on many occasions to efficiently discharge the duties of my office. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM CUMMING GOW, C.E., Mem. Assoc. Municipal and County Engineers, Surveyor to the Plumstead Vestry. 67 To the Vestry of the Parish of Plumstead. State Medicine Laboratory, King's College, London, 7th July, 1897. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875-9. Gentlemen, 1. I have the honour to report to you upon the work done by me, as Public Analyst to your Vestry, during the year ended March 31st, 1897. 2. The total number of samples analysed was 200, of which 5 were found to be adulterated. 3. All the samples were purchased and submitted for analysis by the Inspector of the Vestry. 4. The subjoined tables give the various articles which have been examined, their number and description, as well as the general analytical results; where the article was found to be adulterated, the nature and extent of the adulteration are shown. 5. In addition to the four samples of milk reported as adulterated, I have drawn attention to others as being suspicious, or of poor quality, and owing to the very low standard adopted by the Somerset House Chemists (the Referees under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act), I am frequently compelled to pass as genuine, milks that are adulterated to a small extent. 6. A considerable number of cheeses have been examined during the year, in view of the introduction into this country of "margarine" or "filled" cheese, but all the samples proved to contain true butter-fat The amount of butter-fat however varies very largely, and in some Dutch cheeses I have recently examined, the fat varies from as much as 26 per cent. to as little as 10.7 per cent., so that it would be well if a standard were adopted for this article. I am, Yours faithfully, WILLIAM R. SMITH, M.D., Public Analyst. e 2 68 TABLE I. Showing the Articles examined, and the results of Analysis. Articles. Number of Samples. Number Genuine.

ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, PLUMSTEAD. 1896. To the Chairman and Members of the Plumstead Vestry. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my sixth Annua Report on the health of Plumstead. A.—Vital Statistics. Population. 1. The population was found at the census taken in the spring to be 59,252. Thus, as I anticipated in my last report, the population was over estimated in the preceding years, the rate of increase which existed from 1881 to 1891 having considerably diminished between 1891 and 1896. No doubt this was mainly due to the work having been slacker in the Arsenal, and probably, now that work is again brisk in the Ordnance Factories, the rate of increase will again be higher. The results of the census in tabular form are found in Table XII. 2. The various birth and death rates are reckoned on a population of 59,615, which is the population which existed on 101 the 30th June, assuming that the rate of increase found to exist between 1891 and 1895 has continued since. I have also calculated again the birth and death rates for the year 1895 on a population corrected by the recent census, and these corrected figures are given in Table VI., and wherever 1895 is referred to. All the birth and death rates are corrected for public institutions, viz.: deaths in Hospitals, outside Plumstead of persons who resided in Plumstead are added to the total deaths, and deaths of non-parishioners in the Workhouse and Infirmary are subtracted from the total. The figures given are for a period of 53 weeks ending January 2nd, 1897. Births. 3. The birth-rate 32.7 is higher than it has been for two years, but much lower than for the previous eight years. The actual number of births was, however, the greatest on record. The birth rate was 34.1 in East Plumstead, but only 29.0in West Plumstead. In London as a whole it was 30.2. Deaths. 4. The death-rate 15 6 was slightly lower than last year. There was little Influenza, a mild winter and an average summer; but Measles and Diphtheria were both very fatal. There were 146 deaths in the first quarter, 142 in the second, 121 in the third, and 122 in the fourth. 5. The death-rate in West Plumstead was 14.6, and in East Plumstead 16.0. Infant Mortality. 6. The number of deaths under 1 year per 1000 births (or infantile death-rate) was 133, or one less than in 1895. In my 102 report for 1895 I stated that this figure was high for Plumstead, and had only been twice exceeded since 1885. I accounted for it then by the warm summer and consequent excessive prevalence of summer diarrhoea, but diarrhoea was but little above the average last year. I see nothing to account for the high rate this year, unless it be the prevalence of Measles and Whooping Cough ; it is possible that many of the deaths attributed to Bronchitis and other causes may have been really due to these fatal diseases. 7. The Infantile death-rate was only 98 in West Plumstead, but was 145 in East Plumstead. The adjoining table shews that the difference between East and West Plumstead, in this respect, is much greater than it was three years ago:— West East 1893 132 143 1894 77 100 1895 96 146 1896 98 145 Zymotic Death-Rate. 8. The Zymotic death-rate (i.e., the number of deaths from Small Pox, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Fever, Measles, Whooping Cough, and Diarrhoea per 1,000 population) was 3 5, compared with 2.0 and 2.5 in the two preceding years. Since 1885, the rate has only once been higher, that was in 1893, when it was 3.7. In 1893, as in the past year, Measles and Diphtheria were both very fatal. Uncertified Deaths. 9. There were 27 uncertified deaths, giving a rate of 2 9 per 103 cent. of total deaths, compared with 3 0 last year. 12 were under and 15 over five years. As I stated in my report last year, many of these cases might, I believe, be certified by the medical attendant after reference to the Coroner. Inquests. 10. There were 39 Inquests held, compared with 43 last year. 14 were of children under five years, and 25 of persons over five : 7 referred to deaths in West Plumstead, and 32 to deaths in East Plumstead. 12 deaths were attributed to natural causes, and 27 to accidents or injuries, viz.: 8 suicides, (1 cut throat, 3 hanging, 1 drowning, 1 shooting, 1 railway, 1 poisoning by pruasic acid); 3 children suffocated in bed with parents; 4 children burnt by clothes catching fire, and 3 children scalded; 1 Hydrophobia from bite by a dog which escaped; 1 Tetanus, after compound fracture of arm on football field; 1 from fall while intoxicated; 2 from house taking fire; the remainder from falls, drowning, &c. Other causes of Death. 11. There were 39 deaths from cancer, compared with 37, 33 and 31 in the three preceding years; 13 were in West Plumstead, and 26 in East, i.e., there was a higher percentage in West Plumstead. There was 1 death from puerperal fever, and 5 from labour and its sequelfe. There were 77 deaths from premature birth and low vitality, 19 in West Plumstead, and 58 in East. 12. There were 4 deaths from rheumatic fever, 1 in West Plumstead, and 3 in East. The nurses of the District Nursing Association, nursed, I find, 15 cases of rheumatism ; 10 in West Plumstead, and 5 in East. 104 West and East Plumstead compared. 13. West Plumstead compared very favourably with East as regards the general death rate, and the infantile, zymotic and phthisis death rates. The age distribution of the population in West Plumstead is probably slightly more favourable to a low death rate, owing to the larger number of young female servants it contains; but this is not nearly enough to account for all the difference in the rates, and does not at all affect the infantile and phthisis death rates. West Plumstead. East Plumstead. Population, Census 1896 16714 42538 Population estimated to middle of year 16757 42861 No. of persons to a house 5.7 6 33 Males 8135 21789 Females 8579 20748 Birth rate 29.0 341 Death rate 146 16.0 Deaths under 1 year—per 1000 births 98 145 Zymotic death rate 2.4 3 9 Phthisis death rate 1.2 1.4 Plumstead compared with the other Sanitary Areas of the Metropolis. 14. Seven districts had a lower death rate, viz.:—Lee, Lewisham, Wandsworth, Stoke Newington, Hampstead, Paddington, and St. George's, Hanover Square. If the rates were corrected for age distribution, Plumstead would come above Paddington, and would be approximately equal to Lewisham and Wandsworth. Stoke Newington and Hampstead alone had a lower infantile death rate. The Zymotic death rate, as usual in Plumstead, is high, being this year higher than the London average. 105 B.—Infectious Diseases. (Tables IV. and V.) 15. There were 631 notifications of infectious disease, compared with 790, 886, 713, and 762 in the four preceding years ; 316, or just a half went to Hospital. For a large part of the year the Fever Hospitals were full, so that there was delay in getting patients away. This means that fewer go to Hospital, for in many cases, owing partly to the Arsenal regulations, and partly to other causes, if patients cannot go at the outset, they do not go at all. The new Brook Fever Hospital in Shooter's Hill Eoad was opened in August; since then it has been easier to get patients away ; for although the available beds were quickly filled up, the nearness of the hospital facilitated communication, and lessened the objection of parents to the removal. Towards the close of the year there was a considerable diminution of both Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria, and in January and February of this year (1897) there has been less infectious disease notified than for five years back. Small Pox. 16. Only three cases of Small Pox occurred. One wont to Hospital. All recovered. During the year the report of the Royal Commission on vaccination appeared. The outcome of the report is a strong vindication of vaccination as the chief means of preventing Small Pox, and an urgent recommendation of re-vacciuation as necessary for permanent defence against infection; but in order to make vaccination more popular and prevent the making of anti-vaccination martyrs, it is advised that compulsory measures should be relaxed in cases of conscientious objection 106 to vaccination. It is also suggested that the time allowed for infantile vaccination should be extended to six months ; that public vaccinators should be enabled to offer calf vaccine in all cases; that, when required, they should attend at people's own homes, and that private practitioners should be paid by the public for vaccinating, and be subjected to inspection like the public vaccinators. It is proposed that the sanitary authorities should be made the vaccinating authorities, and they are recommended to use all possible means to encourage revaccination (e.g., by handbills). I called the attention of the Vestry to the danger to Plumstead from the unvaccinated condition of West Ham. I found that whereas in Plumstead of the children born in 1891 there were only two still unvaccinated, and prosecutions had taken place in both cases, in West Ham there were 975 unvaccinated, and no prosecutions had taken place. A letter was sent to the Local Government Board pointing out this danger to Plumstead. I also advised, as on previous occasions, that handbills should be printed recommending voluntary re-vaccination, in view of the serious prevalence of Small Pox in various parts of the country. The Health Committee ordered me to prepare a bill, but unfortunately it was found that the Plumstead Vestry had no power to spend money in the way recommended by the Royal Commission. SCAHLET FEVEK. 17. Scarlet Fever.—There were 352 cases of Scarlet Fever, compared with 61, 584, 527, 480, and 328 in the five preceding years. Thus the steady decline in the prevalence of Scarlet Fever, which I referred to last year, has had a check. 215 cases went to Hospital compared with 194 in the previous 107 year. This is about the same proportion. There were 14 deaths, 8 at Hospital and 6 at home. This gives death rates of 4.3 at home and 3.7 at Hospital. Last year the death rate was 3.0 both at home and Hospital. In 1894 it was 3.3 at home, 4.8 in Hospital; 1893, 4 0 at home, and 8 0 in Hospital. Although tbe death rate was ratber more in 1896 than in 1895, it was considerably less than in the three preceding years. 18. Table IV. gives the cases occurring in each of the eight wards into which Plumstead is divided. The number affected per 1,000 population varied from 7.9 in the North-West Ward, 7.8 in the West, 7.0 in the South and South-East, to 5.2 in the North, 4.8 in the East, 3.9 in the South-West, and 2.8 in the North-East. From Table 5 it appears that Ancona Road, Bloomfield Road, and Burrage Grove Schools were most affected, Plumstead Road and Eglinton Road the least. 19. Age incidence.—114 of the cases were under 5 years of age, and 238 over 5. But of the deaths 12 were under 5 and only 2 over 5. That is, the case death rate was 10.5 under 5 years of age and only 0 8 over 5. These figures indicate the large number of lives saved by preventive measures which postpone the occurrence of Scarlet Fever, if they do not always prevent it altogether. 20. Doubtful Cases.—I saw two doubtful cases in consultation with the medical attendants. In both cases I confirmed the diagnosis of Scarlet Fever. One had been mixing freely with the family, the disease not being suspected to be infectious. Another case in which I believe the friends had not suspected the true nature of the malady, was a boy sent home 108 from Vicarage Road School by the teacher who noticed that his hands were peeling. I was informed, and on visiting the boy found that he was desquamating from Scarlet Fever, and had been at home a few days previously with a very slight rash, supposed to be nettle rash. 21. Concealed Gases and Wilful Exposure.—In another case a boy was sent home from Earl Street School by the master because his hands were peeling. He was taken on foot next day to see a medical man. The case having been duly notified as Scarlet Fever, it was found that the boy was not being carefully isolated, and on my report, the Health Committee determined to prosecute for wilful exposure of the boy by being taken to see a doctor after having been told by the schoolmaster that he was suffering from Scarlet Fever. The Magistrate refused, however, to convict, believing that the exposure was not wilful. Four children belonging to one family were sent home peeling from Bloomfield Road School; in these cases I believe there was deliberate concealment of the disease on the part of the parent, but there was no evidence to shew this. But in another case sent home peeling from Eglinton Road School, there was not only good reason to think that the parent had deliberately concealed the existence of the Fever, but after notification and the usual warning, she persisted in exposing the child in the streets; she was accordingly summoned, and being convicted of wilful exposure, was fined £1 and costs. I attended the Police Court and gave evidence as to the existence of Scarlet Fever and obstruction on the part of the parent when I called to see the child. The exposure was proved by the child's schoolfellows. The various teachers, who, by their watchfulness, were enabled to detect these cases, and so prevent further spread of 109 infection, deserve great credit, and if similar vigilance were practised by all school teachers, I believe there would be a considerable reduction in the number of cases of Scarlet Fever. There is no doubt that infection is now mainly kept up by mild cases unsuspected or deliberately concealed. The action of the Vestry in prosecuting the above cases seems so far to have had the desired result, for I have heard of no more cases of concealment. There was another prosecution for exposing a child in a perambulator in the street, while still suffering from Scarlet Fever; a fine of 10/- was inflicted. 22. Return Cases.—In four cases of Scarlet Fever there was reason to think that the source of infection was a child in the same family who had returned from the Fever Hospital. In one of these I found that a sister had returned from the Hospital six days before, and on examination I discovered that she had a copious discharge from the ear. She was in Hospital six weeks. In another case a brother had returned 10 days before ; he had enlarged tonsils and a chronic mucous discharge from the nose. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. 23. There were 198 cases of Diphtheria and Croup, compared with 37, 118, 179, 118, and 148 in the five preceding years. Thus the past year shewed a higher prevalence of Diphtheria than any recent year. There were 60 deaths : this is five fewer than in 1893, the most fatal year for Diphtheria since 1885. 110 88 cases went to Hospital, of whom 23 died, giving a death rate of 26 per cent. The death rate at home was 33 per cent. The death rate at home, in the past three years, was 30,32, and 25 per cent. respectively, and at Hospital 50, 35, and 19 per cent. respectively. Thus we see that, for the cases treated at home, the fatality last year was greater than in any recent year. For cases treated at Hospital, the fatality last year was greater than in 1895, but much less than in 1893 and 1894. I believe that in the Hospitals all serious cases are treated with Antitoxin serum, but it is to be presumed that few such cases are so treated at home. Whence the striking change in the incidence of mortality. 24. The following are the rates in the several wards of cases occurring per 1,000 population, in the order of frequency: West, 44; North-West, 4 3; South-West, 4.1; South, 3.8; South-East, 3 0; East, 2.7; North-East, 2.4; and North, 2.2. The West and North-West wards include St. James' Parish, which has, for several years, had the highest prevalence of Diphtheria. The South-West Ward was more affected than in recent years. Bloomfield and Ancona Road Schools were most affected. 25. Table V. shews that the 198 cases occurred in 175 houses. In only 23 houses did the infection affect other inmates. 26. No doubt mild cases occur which are never suspected; in others there may be some symptoms pointing to Diphtheria, but the case being slight, is not notified, and after a short stay at home returns to school to infect others. I saw, in consultation with the medical attendant, two or 1ll three such mild cases, in which I confirmed the suspicion of Diphtheria being present. In one of these a brother had a suspicious throat six weeks ago. Many of these doubtful cases might be cleared up, and the spread of infection prevented, if medical practitioners had the means of obtaining a bacteriological examination of the patient's throat. This is provided for now by many Sanitary authorities in London and the Provinces; among others, in Bristol, Holborn, St. Pancras, New York, &c. In these places, any doubtful case is examined at the outset, for determining if Diphtheria is or is not present, and all cases are examined at the termination, to discover if the disease has ceased to be infectious. My recommendation that arrangements should be made by which this could be done for Plumstead, was approved by the Health Committee, but, unfortunately, it was found that the Plumstead Vestry had no power to spend money for such an object. This is very much to be regretted, for obviously such expenditure of money would directly and materially assist in the prevention of one of the most fatal diseases with which the Vestry has to deal. 27. The period when a case of Diphtheria ceases to be infectious is very uncertain, and appears to vary from 3 or 4 weeks to 6 or 7 months. It is generally considered that when a bacteriological examination cannot be obtained, at least six weeks should expire before a case can be regarded as free from infection. Case3 often appear to be quite well, however, much sooner than this, and at the urgent request of parents medical men commonly give their sanction to a cessation of isolation after the lapse of 2 or 3 weeks; they argue sometimes that it would be useless to attempt to procure a longer isolation when 112 there is nothing they can point to in the condition of the patient to indicate that there is infectious disease present, consequently, patients often return to school in an infectious state. In order to obviate this evil to some extent, and having failed to secure provision for bacteriological examinations, I recommended that the School Board should be asked to exclude all cases notified as having Diphtheria for a period of six weeks, just as they are excluded in Measles for four weeks. The Board refused however on the advice of their Medical Officer to comply with this suggestion, on the ground that the medical attendant should decide when a child can return to school. But I have reason to believe that medical men would be the first to welcome such a rule. Enteric Fever. 28. There were 29 cases of Enteric Fever, compared with 22, 29, 26, and 214 in the four preceding years. This shows that no increased prevalence of this disease has been left behind by the epidemic of 1895, as usually occurs when an epidemic has been a result of insanitary conditions. The cases were scattered all over the parish. In 14 cases there were defective drains or other serious insanitary conditions. Four cases occurred in one house, where a very faulty drain ran under the house. In one case the patient was in the habit of eating oysters freely. In another case the disease was evidently contracted at the seaside. There were 4 deaths. Puerperal Fever. 29. There were 3 cases of Puerperal Fever notified last year compared with 7 in 1895, One died. Besides this death, there were 5 deaths from labour and its sequelae. I am of 113 opinion that probably some of these deaths were due to communicable affections, which should, therefore, have been notified. The Public Health Act does not define Puerperal Fever, but I consider it should be regarded as applying to metritis, peritonitis, and pelvic inflammation occurring as a sequel of child.birth, besides to the usual forms of puerperal pyaemia and septicamia. Three cases of Puerperal Fever having occurred in the practice of one midwife at the close of 1895, I requested her, at the beginning of 1896, besides taking the usual measures of disinfection, to abstain from attending any further cases for one month. This she agreed to do, and no more cases occurred in her practice. I have found that Puerperal Fever most often occurs in the practice of midwives. Accordingly, I have, by the authorization of the Health Committee, issued to the midwives practising in Plumstead a printed bill of recommendations for antiseptic measures, and other precautions, likely to tend to the avoidance of infection. 30. There were 43 cases of Erysipelas, compared with 53 in 1895. Measles. 31. There was a serious outbreak of Measles during the past year, causing 68 deaths, which is more than in any. recent year. The highest number recorded since 1885 was 48 in 1886. The epidemic commenced in the first quarter, reached its height in the second quarter, and has declined since. Not only did this outbreak of Measles cause more deaths than any previous one, but more than have been due to any other infectious disease in the past 10 years, except Phthisis. H 114 32. In face of this striking fact one naturally asks what is the Sanitary Authority doing to diminish the ravages of this fatal malady ? and the answer is very little. By order of the Health Committee, I again distributed some 9,000 copies of the handbill of precautions which was issued in 1895 (see Appendix). 33. The Health Committee also authorized me to write to the Directors of Voluntary Schools, asking them to adopt the same precautions with respect to Measles, as are required of the teachers of the London Board Schools. The School Board teachers do not admit a child who has had measles, till a month has elapsed from the commencement of the illness. They also refuse admission to any child coming from the same house as the patient for two weeks from the onset of the disease. The Directors of the Central and All Saints' Day Schools replied expressing their intention to comply with the Committee's request. 34. So much but no more has been done. It is doubtless true that in a disease like Measles, the onset of which is difficult to recognize, but which is very infectious in the early unrecognized stage, we cannot hope to diminish its prevalence to the same extent as in Scarlet Fever. But I believe a good deal can be done, and if only a few lives can be saved every year no pains, and no moderate expense should be spared. I have never yet advocated the general notification of Measles, as it appears doubtful from the experience of places where it has been tried whether the results are commensurate with the expense. It has been proposed lately that the fir3t case only in a house should be notified and paid for. This plan would no doubt be very advantageous and much less expensive than a general notification, but I think it could not be enforced 115 under the present Public Health Act. It might, however, be made voluntary, 2/6 being paid for the notification of each first case in a house. But the great difficulty is the fact that probably in the majority of cases of measles no doctor is called in. 35. The primary schools are the great means of spreading the infection of Measles, and it is probably to the school managers and teachers that we must mainly look for contending with the spread of infection. The present School Board regulations are excellent as far as they go, but they do not go far enough. The teachers of the various schools act independently and are neither in communication with each other nor with the Medical Officer of Health. I have therefore proposed a school notification of measles, viz.: that teachers should send me word of any children they exclude from school on this account. If this were done, I should know at once when measles was prevalent among the children of any one school, and in special cases should know in time when it was wise to recommend the closure, say, of the infant department of a school, a proceeding which I have no doubt, might at times greatly assist in staying an epidemic. I should also be able, in cases where children in one house attend two or more schools, to warn the teachers of the other schools to exclude those children. The Health Committee approved of my recommendation, and I found that the great majority of the teachers would willingly co.operate in the proposed plan. The Vestry has not yet, however, authorized me to incur the small expense requisite for printing notification forms, &c. I would again strongly urge that no moderate expenditure should be allowed to weigh against the health and lives of the children of the Parish. Phthisis. 36. Phthisis, or consumption, caused 81 deaths, compared with 111, 70, and 96 in the three preceding years In addition h 2 116 to the deaths from Phthisis there were 26 deaths attributed to other tubercular diseases, 19 being of infants under 5 years of age. The death rate per 1000 population was 1.3. In East Plumstead it was 14, and in West Plumstead 1.2. For several years previous to 1896 the phthisis death rate has been considerably higher in West Plumstead than in East, but this relation has now changed. 37. Although it was a favourable year for phthisis, and the phthisis death rate was lower than for several years past with one exception in 1894, yet this disease caused more deaths than any of the ordinary infectious diseases, and more than any one disease with the possible exception of bronchitis. It is obvious then that any measures which help to diminish the prevalence of phthisis will greatly affect the rate of sickness and death, and this just at the most important period of life, viz., from 20 to 40 years,which is the time when consumption claims most of its victims. 38. It is a well known fact that the sanitary measures of the past thirty years, which have produced improved drainage, better houses with more light and air, and less overcrowding, have already resulted in a considerable diminution of phthisis; and all means that are now being taken to remedy defective drains, remove dampness in houses, promote cleanliness of rooms, and generally to cause the soil and the air to be purer, are means for lessening the prevalence of phthisis. But within the past ten years it has come to be generally recognized that phthisis is an infectious disease, and that therefore it is desirable to take means to prevent the spread of the infection which is found in the expectoration of phthisical persons. The infection, it is true, does not affect people as a rule, unless 117 they are predisposed, either by inheritance, by impaired health, by alcoholism, or by living in insanitary conditions, such as overcrowding. It is also practically impossible to treat consumptives in the same way as people suffering from Scarlet Fever, nor is it necessary. But, accepting these limitations, there remains the fact that a large proportion of the public are predisposed, and that it is an easy and simple matter to take certain very effective steps for preventing the spread of infection, notably the disinfection of the sputa of those affected. 39. In view of the above considerations, which I put before the Health Committee in October last, the Committee requested me to prepare a handbill of precautions against the infection of Phthisis. This I did, and have had them printed and circulated, medical men, nurses, and others coming in contact with phthisical patients, having kindly undertaken to distribute them. A copy of these precautions is appended to the Report. 40. Two years ago, the Health Committee decided to supply disinfectants gratis for use in Phthisis, and to disinfect the rooms which had been occupied by consumptives after their death or removal. I am sorry to say that neither of these opportunities is made as much use of as could be wished, partly on account of its not being generally known that they exist, partly from the necessity of such measures not being sufficiently recognized. If the cases of Phthisis were known to the sanitary officials, a bill of precautions might be left at each house, giving instructions as to disinfection, &c. It is very desirable that medical men and others should voluntarily give notice to the Vestry of cases of Phthisis as they occur. 118 C. Sanitary Work. 41. Water Supply.—The Water of the Kent Company from the Plumstead Well was analyzed by the Vestry's Analyst, Prof. W. R Smith; its condition was found satisfactory. The Analysis is appended. 42. Sewers.—I found that sewage found its way into the levels by the White Hart Lane sewer overflow. The Surveyor on examination discovered that there was an obstruction in the Cage Lane sewer, which caused the sewage to escape this way, even wheu there was no great downfall of rain. On my recommendation that means should be taken to prevent the possible recurrence of this contamination of the level ditches, it was decided to construct a new sewer from White Hart Lane to the main outfall. Plans for this have been prepared. I may add here that I also reported on the importance of thorough cleansing of the level ditches, in view of the fact that their water is drunk by cattle, and that their contamination may thus lead to infection of the milk supply. 43. Ventilation of Sewers.—In my Annual Reports of former years, I have referred to the nuisance and danger to health arising from the manhole ventilators. This question has long been under discussion. My recommendation was simply to close the open grids in all places where they were likely to give rise to a nuisance, and to place shaft ventilators at the head of sewers of steep gradients; thus aiming at avoiding any great pressure of sewer gas, but not attempting to get thorough ventilation of the sewers. The Vestry decided, however, to try a more complicated and expensive system, viz.: what is called, I believe, sectional ventilation. Flap valves are placed in the sewers, at frequent intervals, which prevent 119 the ascent of the sewer gas, aud the sewer immediately below each valve is connected with a shaft ventilator. The grid openings are left to act as inlets. This system is now being gradually introduced. I fear that many of the shafts may be found to cause a nuisance, to the upper storeys of neighbouring houses, but no doubt they are less dangerous, and will cause less nuisance, than the road level ventilators, and will, I anticipate, remedy the evils of these. 44. The Churchyard.—There were 253 interments in the Plumstead Churchyard, compared with 318 and 358 in the two preceding years. This shows a satisfactory decline. The Vicar has, I understand, taken the necessary steps to ensure that the Churchyard will in future only be used for the burial of those who already have members of their family buried there. A wall and railing have been erected round the ground. 45. The Cemetery.—I inspected the Cemetery on different occasions and found its general condition as before, very satisfactory. I observed, however, that the grave spaces were not designated by convenient marks, as laid down in the regulations for cemeteries. On my pointing out this omission, the Burial Board immediately provided suitable metal pegs marked with the numbers of the graves. 46. The Mortuary.—I visited the Mortuary on several occasions and found it well kept. It was used during the year for 23 bodies, as compared with 19 and 35 in the two preceding years. The new Mortuary has not been commenced yet. 47. The Health Refuge.—I inspected the Health Befuge on more thau one occasion, and reported to the Health Committee 120 the steps necessary for placing it in a sanitary condition. It was, however, decided to build a new Eefuge, and this is now approaching completion. The Refuge was used ou two occasions for a total of 8 people. In 1894 it was used on nine occasions by 20 persons, and in 1895 on two occasions by 10 persons 48. Bakehouses.—As usual, I inspected all the Bakehouses twice, in the spring and autumn. I found their condition on the whole satisfactory. Under the new Factory Act, no now bakehouses can be opened underground. This will greatly tend to improve the condition of things in regard to light aud ventilation. 49. Dairies.—I inspected all the dairies during the year in company with the Chief Inspector, and some of them independently at other times. Certain improvements were carried out on our suggestion. The general sanitary condition of the dairies is fairly satisfactory, but there is no doubt that the existing regulations for the control of dairies leave much to be desired. There are no regulations for securing that cows are free from Tubercle, or that their udders are clean when they are milked, or that the hands that milk them are clean. There is thus no security against the conveyance of disease by milk. All these matters are provided for in Continental dairies. The penalties for watering and otherwise adulterating milk too are absurdly insufficient. Probably more disease is caused by impure milk than by any other article of diet except alcohol. 50. Slaughterhouses.—I inspected all the Slaughterhouses with the Chief Sanitary Inspector, and advised as to measures 121 for preventing any nuisance arising from them. As regards the prevention of Tubercle and other diseases being caused by the consumption of meat, no inspection of slaughterhouses can prevent this. The only way would be to have all animals killed inspected by a qualified meat inspector before they are cut up, and this is not likely to be attained as long as private slaughterhouses are allowed. 51. Gipsy Tents and Vans.— I inspected several Gipsy tents and vans, mainly with a view to the detection of overcrowding and infectious disease. The filthy state in which the inhabitants of these movable dwellings live is a danger to the neighbourhood which they visit. The Vestry Clerk, in consultation with me, drew up some Bye.laws which, if approved by the Local Government Board, will no doubt make it much easier to deal with these unsavoury visitors. The Chief Inspector was much occupied too with the Gipsies, owing to the numerous complaints received as to nuisances caused by them. 52. Workshops.—It is now incumbent on the sanitary authorities to see after the sanitary condition of workshops and factories. The principal workshops in Plumstead are laundries and dressmakers; there are also a few tailors' workshops. As these workshops are discovered by the inspectors they are entered in a register, to enable them to be periodically visited. I have inspected several with a view to the prevention of overcrowding. Other insanitary conditions, such as insufficient water closet accommodation, have also been remedied after the serving of notices by the Inspectors. 122 53. Smoke Nuisance.—In the autumn of the year I was forcibly struck with the large amount of smoke emitted from the Arsenal chimneys. I accordingly wrote to the Director General in December, respectfully calling his attention to the nuisance thus caused, and informing him that I frequently observed dense black smoke proceeding from chimneys for more than five minutes. He replied that he would take all possible means to prevent the nuisance, and I am glad to say that I have observed much less smoke during the past three months. 54. Register of Nurses.—When Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever have been prevalent, I have frequently found that patients who were prevented from being moved to hospital, owiug to want of accommodation in the Fever Hospitals, could not be properly isolated in their own houses, owing to the difficulty of getting any one to look after them. I accordingly proposed to commence a register of women, whether trained nurses or not, who were willing to nurse Infectious cases. The Health Committee authorized me to do this, but without incurring any expense for making the register known. Perhaps owing to the existence of the register being unknown, it has been very little used, but may, I hope, prove more serviceable in future. 55. Dust Shoots.—As far as I saw—and was able to learn— no house refuse was deposited last year on private shoots within 300 yards of houses. All went to the parish shoot on the levels. This, as I reported last year, was within the proscribed distance of houses, hut, being carefully treated by burning and covering with soil, produced no nuisance. Quite recently land has been procured beyond the 300 yards limit, and the dust is now being shot there. 123 56. House Inspection.—Besides the numerous houses inspected for particular reasons, I made a house.to.house inspection in Hartville and Mabyn Roads, two of the poorest streets in the parish. The condition of most of these houses was anything but satisfactory. Dirty and damp walls and ceilings, defective roofs, defective water.closet pans and flushing apparatus, and defective drains were the nuisances chiefly found. The bad condition in which I found these houses, combined with the observed fact of the deterioration of the health of East Plumstead, compared with West Plumstead in recent years, determined me to examine into the vital statistics of the neighbourhood where Hartville and Mabyn Roads are situated. I reported on the results to the Vestry. I have now been able to incorporate into the Report the statistics for 1896, and, with the corrections rendered necessary by this addition, the following is the Report I presented :— " Report on Reidhaven Road District. "North of High Street and West of Bannockburn Road, including the 14 streets, Reidhaven Road, Gavin Street, Plever. ham Road, Abery Street, Gunning Street, White Hart Lane, Garibaldi Street, Kentmere Road, Barth Road, Hartville Road, Mabyn Road, Bateson Street, Marmadon Road to 24 and 67, and Glenside Road. This district comprises according to Kelly's Directory 551 houses. According to the 1896 census there aro 6.33 people to a house in East Plumstead. This would give the 124 tion (1/16 of Plumstead) of the district as 3487; but Mr. Ranee inspecting 536 of the houses during 1895, found they contained 3532 which gives 66 to a house. At this rate the population would be 3631, which number is the basis of the following statistics. Death Statistics. Reidhaven Road District Plumstead. Reidhaven Road Dist.

Deaths from Diarrhoea more than 4 times as great in proportion as in Plumstead as a whole. Deaths from Phthisis greater in proportion than in Plumstead (1/15). Deaths and notifications of Diphtheria shew that it is more prevalent in proportion to population, and much more prevalent in proportion to numbers living at ages when most Diphtheria cases occur. The great bulk of the cases of Enteric Fever in 1895 were due to a milk supply confined mainly to West Plumstead. Omitting then, this year, the deaths and notifications in 1894 and 1896 of Enteric Fever, shew that it is more than three times as prevalent in the Reidhaven Road district as in Plumstead as a whole. It is then, for Plumstead, a very unhealthy area. Class of Population.—There is on the whole a poor and low class of population in this district, though different parts of it vary much in this respect, some streets being much worse than others, and sometimes one side of the street being superior to the other side. I have no means of determining the number of births in this district, the deaths per 1000 births having been calculated on the assumption that the birth rate was the same as in the rest of East Plumstead, i.e., an average of 33.5 for the three years. The Situation and Rouses.—The level of the ground water is high. 126 The houses are chiefly 4, 5 or 6 roomed. About a third are occupied by two families. All the houses have been inspected by the Sanitary Inspector, being comparatively new, there are few seriously insanitary conditions, but minor sanitary defects are very common and recur very frequently. Thus two streets—Mabyn and Hartville Eoads were inspected 18 months ago, and sanitary defects were found in 63 houses out of 74. They were again inspected by me in July and August, and sanitary defects found in 48. The defects consist mostly of damp walls, dirty walls aud ceilings with bugs, dilapidations of plaster, &c., defective roofs, defective w.c. pans and flushing apparatus, defective gullies and so on. It will be seen, that, although these defects would not be usually serious when existing separately, when several minor defects exist simultaneously, as is often the case, the house becomes seriously insanitary. Overcrowding.—Frequent instances of overcrowding have been discovered and abated. Overcrowding is, of course, a comparative term. One may say that, compared with a healthy ideal, all these houses are overcrowded. But, for practical purposes, it has been found impossible to demand more than 300 cubic feet sleeping accommodation in this class of houses, and, consequently, overcrowding usually means a less provision than 300 cubic feet for each adult. The fact that there are 6.6 people to a house, and that the houses are of the smallest, very few having more than five small rooms, shows that this district is much more crowded than Plumstead as a whole. Drainage.—The ground lying so low, difficulty was naturally found in draining it. There are two principal sewers in this district, the Reidhaven Road and the Glenside Road Sewer. Neither of these sewers has, I believe, a very good fall, and I 127 understand they are both liable to heading back from the outfall when the latter is charged by storm-water, which not infrequently happens. About a year ago, when the stoppage of a drain in Barth Road was being enquired into, I found that the branch of the Glenside Road Sewer, which runs from Barth Road down Mabyn Road was silted up with about 4 inches of deposit. I have also found 2 inches of deposit in the sewer at the upper end of Reidhaven Road. There would thus appear to be insufficient fall in these sewers. Further, the drains leading into these sewers appear to have been, in many cases, very badly made, with the result that they frequently become stopped. A drain may become stopped from a number of causes, but perhaps the following is the most usual course of events:— 'The drain has been improperly made, and has, in its course, either a too sharp bend, or a rectangular junction, or a projection; some solid material accumulates at the defective spot; if the joints were good, this would soon be cleared again by the accumulation of water above; but the joints being bad, will stand no pressure of water, which escapes into the surrounding soil, until the drain becomes silted up for yards.' Since the beginning of 1895, there have been 21 complaints of choked and defective drains and bad smells from drain or sewer in the Reidhaven Road district. Besides these, a large number of defective drains have been found when inspecting houses after infectious disease, or house-to-house. Altogether, between June 1st, 1895, and Sept. 30th, 1896, there have been 86 instances of choked w.c.'s and choked and defective drains. There have also been found 249 128 stances of defective w.c. apparatus. That is, in more than half the houses in this district some defects were found in the water closet or drains. And it must he remembered that all these houses had been inspected, and defects remedied in 1892. The result of such defective drains and the frequent stoppage, must be that the ground round the houses becomes infiltrated with filth; and this is a more serious and lasting condition in a low-lying flat neighbourhood than it would be on a slope. The prevalence of diarrhoea in this district is no doubt largely a result of this condition of the soil. Summary.—To sum up, 1 have shewn that in the Reidhaven Road District: 1. The general death-rate, the infantile death-rate, and the death-rates from Diarrhoea and Enteric Fever are all very high. 2. The death-rates from Diphtheria and Phthisis are higher than in Plumstead. 3. The sewers do not sufficiently carry off the sewage. 4. The drains are very defective. 5. The general structural condition of the houses is very defective. 6. The district is largely inhabited by a very poor and ignorant class of inhabitants. 7. There is a considerable amount of overcrowding. 129 Recommendations.—To meet this serious condition of things, I make the following recommendations: I. That all the drains in this district which have not already been tested, should forthwith be tested with the smoke machine. II. That the Surveyor should be asked to report how the sewerage of this district can be improved. III. That all new drains, and drains re-laid in this district, should be tested with the water test, as is commonly done in other places. IV. That a lady Sanitary Inspector be appointed to act in this and other poor parts of the Parish. Her duties would be—to visit all houses where infectious diseases occurred, and explain the measures to be taken; to advise tenants as to cleanliness and personal hygiene, especially with regard to infants; to enquire as to overcrowding and other insanitary conditions and report on the same. If recommendation I. is carried out, the time of one Sanitary Inspector will be fully occupied for some time to come in drain testing, so that it will be necessary for that reason alone to appoint an additional Inspector." (This concludes the Report on the Reidhaven Road District). 57.—The Surveyor is engaged in making some improvements in the Reidhaven Road Sewer, but the other recommendations for improving this district still remain to be carried out. 58. I have recently become aware that some of the houses in this district, probably a large proportion, are built on a I 130 deposit of house refuse of recent date. I was previously under the impression that this was not so. Two cases of Enteric Fever and one case of Diphtheria occurred at a house in Gavin Street, and, on examination, it was found that the drains were defective, and that the ground under the wooden floor of the basement consisted of sodden house refuse; there was no layer of concrete below the boards. The building of houses on deposits of house refuse is well known to be a potent cause of Diarrhoea, and is very likely to conduce to Enteric Fever, Diphtheria, and other diseases. The Inspectors' Work (see Table IX.) 59. 1,620 houses were inspected (house-to-house), or 100 more than last year. At this rate, it will take six years to go through the parish, whereas it is desirable that this should be done every three years. But, having regard to the 5,000 reinspections, and more than 3,000 special inspections for infectious diseases, &c., I think it is satisfactory that so many house-to-house inspections were made. The large number of re-inspections, after service of notices, is a striking indication of how the Inspectors' time is wasted by people who choose to treat the Vestry with contempt, and pay no attention to its formal demands. 60. The large number of choked and defective drains (483, i.e., 61 in excess of last year), occupied much of the Inspectors' time. An excessive proportion of these occurred in the Reidhaven Road district. In 408 houses the drains were tested by the smoke test. 61. I recommended, during the year, that all new drains should be tested by the water test before being passed. This test is no more searching for superficial defects than the smoke 131 test, but whereas the latter is useless to shew a defect two or three feet under the ground, the water test shews it just as surely as if on the surface. And the danger of defective drains is not wholly or principally the escape of sewer gas, but the infiltration of the soil with sewage. 62. The Chief Inspector tested the drains at the Girls' High School, and found them very defective. He had them relaid and put into a satisfactory condition. 63. Twenty-one cases of Overcrowding were found, of which I visited 10. They were mostly dealt with by advice as to rearrangement of sleeping accommodation, but in several cases notices were served 64. Table IX. shews that the larger number of nuisances found were remedied without the service of statutory notices. 1663 intimation notices were served, but only 307 statutory notices. Of these, 160 were reported to the Clerk after the time allowed had expired. After the receipt of a letter from the Clerk, the work was done in all but eleven cases, for which summonses were taken out at the Police Court. These eleven defaulters, it will be observed, necessitated at least 44 inspections and 33 letters or notices. In six cases the offenders were fined. In the majority of the other cases, orders were made for the work to be done, and the cost of the summons to be paid. A builder and house owner was fined £10 and costs, for improperly repairing a drain, and the man he employed £1. A man, working on his own account as a general house repairer, was fined, for the same offence, 10/- and costs in each of two cases, in spite of a plea of poverty, and another incompetent J 2 132 workman, acting under an employer was fined 5/-. The lesson of these three cases is that it is desirable to employ competent workmen to repair drains. 65. There are now four houses on the register of houses occupied by more than one family. Two houses were added during the year, and two taken off. I proposed to add a large number of houses on different occasions, but the proposal nearly always had the effect of turning the tenants out, and reducing the house to occupation by one family. It is much to be regretted that house owners should have so strong an objection to their houses being registered, for it is obvious that the people turned out will probably go and overcrowd some other house. Many houses are, however, kept under observation without being registered. 66. A considerable number of Sanitary defects, found by the Inspectors, were in comparatively new houses, whose sanitary arrangements had been passed by the Vestry. I have, in previous Reports, called attention to the great importance of thorough inspection of the sanitary arrangements of new houses. To have houses constructed in a sanitary condition in the first instance is a simple and comparatively inexpensive matter, but the remedying of faulty conditions afterwards is much more complicated and expensive. I wish to insist on the importance of seeing that the County Council Bye-laws, and other regulations and enactments with regard to house drainage, are strictly carried out. I would again respectfully ask your Vestry to give your serious attention to this matter. Need for Additional Inspector. 67. I have already referred to the large amount of work done by the Sanitary Inspectors, and this, as well as the work 133 of the Health Committee Clerk, is shewn by Table IX. Indeed, the Inspectors' time is so fully occupied that they have little or no leisure for several branches of sanitary work, viz.:— inspecting unsound food, inspecting of offensive trade refuse as fish offal, and inspecting of workshops. I have also referred to the too slow progress of house-tohouse inspection. There is now no Dust Inspector, and it is impossible for the present staff of Sanitary Inspectors to look after the dust collection. Four years ago, there was also an Assistant Sanitary Clerk. Thus the sanitary staff has been diminished by two. During this time, the work required of the inspectors has been increased by the passing of the various Bye-laws under the Public Health Act, and by the Factory and Workshops Acts. Besides this, recent legal decisions have thrown on the Vestry the responsibility of keeping in repair all combined drains for which no plans can be found. The result of this has been that house owners, as soon as they have anything wrong with their drains, instead of seeing to it themselves as formerly, now send word to the Health Office, aud the Sanitary Inspector has to go and examine the drain, which examination sometimes occupies several days. Sketches and particulars then have to be furnished to the Vestry Clerk and Surveyor, and the Committee's orders obtained thereon. This, obviously, entails much work on the Inspectors. According to the last Annual Report of the Medical Officer of the County Council there are, on an average, 2,515 houses to each Sanitary Inspector in London, while in Plumstead there are 3,137 houses to each Inspector. But the amount of walking and, therefore, the work, of an inspector is proportionate to the size of his district, and there is no doubt the 134 size of each inspector's district in Plumstead is far in excess of the average. So far, Plumstead has had a good reputation as a healthy locality where sanitation took a very prominent place; but this reputation must, necessarily, be lost, if the staff of inspectors is allowed to fall below the requirements of the place. I, therefore, desire to respectfully urge the recommendation in my Report on the Reidhaven Road district, that an additional Inspector be appointed. 68. I have to acknowledge the diligent and whole-hearted way in which the Sanitary Inspectors, and the Committee Clerk, have performed their duties. 69. I have also to thank the Chairman and members of the Health Committee for the kind way in which my recommendations have always been received. 1 have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, SIDNEY DAVIES. 135 TABLE I.

Precautions against Consumption. 1 .—Consumption is an infectious, curable disease. 2.—The infection, however, never attacks people unless their system is seriously weakened. 3.—Most of those who get Consumption have inherited a special weakness of the lungs from their parents, but in other cases the system is weakened by intemperance, want of nourishment, disease, and insanitary conditions, especially confinement to close unventilated rooms, in damp houses. 4.—The infection is conveyed in two ways: — (1).—By breathing or swallowing infectious particles from the sputa of consumptive persons. If the sputa become dry, the infection may be inhaled as dust with the air breathed. (2).—By swallowing the milk or meat of tuberculous animals. 5.—Consumptive persons should never spit on the floor or into handkerchiefs, but into a cup containing some disinfectant, or, failing that, some water. The cup should be frequently emptied down the w.c., and washed out with boiling water. Disinfectants may be obtained free at the Health Offices, Maxey Road. 6.—If no kind of vessel containing liquid is at hand, small pieces of rag or paper may be used. These should bo burnt as quickly as possible, or the pieces of paper may be thrown down a water closet. 7.—For those who have to leave home, pocket spittoons may be bought through any Chemist—price, about 3s. 6d. 8.—Consumptives should carefully avoid swallowing their own expectoration, or they may reinfect themselves. 9.—Consumptives should avoid kissing altogether. 10.—All danger of infection from milk and meat of tuberculous-animals may be avoided by boiling the milk and thoroughly cooking the meat, preferably by boiling. Members of Consumptive families should specially attend to this rule. 11.—Close and crowded rooms, concert halls, theatres, and public houses, should be avoided. 12.—The rooms occupied by a Consumptive person should contain no unnecessary furniture; and, especially curtains, bed hangings, clothes hanging about should be avoided as far as possible. The rooms should be frequently cleaned out when the Consumptive in not in them. On the Consumptive ceasing to occupy any room, it should be thoroughly disinfected. This will be done, on application, by a Ve3try Official, free of charge. 13.—Consumptives should pass as much time out of doors as possible, and when indoors the room should be well ventilated. When sufficient clothing is worn the windows may safely be kept open day and night, unless the weather is very severe, but draughts must be avoided. As much sunlight as possible should be admitted. 14.—No one else should occupy the same bed with a Consumptive person, and where possible a separate bedroom should be used. 15.—When the above precautions arc taken there is no danger of a Consumptive person infecting anybody else.

Having regard to the serious nature of some parts of the Medical Officer's Report for 1896, for which report he alone is responsible, and with some portions of which report they do not agree, the Committee consider it right that they should also present a report upon the Health of the Parish, and the work of the Committee. General Health Statistics. 1. Although the Birth Bate 32.7, as against 30.2 in London, as a whole, is higher than it has been for the past two years, and the actual number of births the greatest on record, yet the death-rate 15.6 was lower than the preceding year, 1895, and bears most favourable comparison with that in the other 43 Sanitary Areas in the Metropolis, there being, after correction for age distribution, three only out of the 44 areas, having a lower death-rate; and the death-rate for the whole parish is still continuing to improve. It is satisfactory to note that there has been no recurrence of the attack of typhoid fever which affected the parish in 1895, and that during the year there has been no epidemic of 154 any kind. Also that the number of notifications of infectious diseases 631 for 53 weeks is lower than in the four preceding years, notwithstanding the rapidly increasing population. Health of Reidhaven Road District. 2. Much has been made by the Medical Officer in his report, of the alleged insanitary condition of the area covered by Reidhaven Road and contiguous streets. The Committee have given their serious consideration to this matter, and having regard to the nature and terms of the Medical Officer's Report thereon, considered the alleged evils and their suggested remedies at a special meeting. The Committee found that there were special reasons why the health of the people living in this Area was not in such an excellent condition as that of the rest of the Parish, and that, for these reasons, this area was likely to remain less healthy than the other parts of Plumstead. Firstly, most of the ground upon which these houses is built is low lying, and was originally marsh ground, and it appears, from the Medical Officer's Report, that some portion of it was used as a shoot for house and other refuse, and this, naturally, has formed an unhealthy foundation for the houses. Secondly, a number of the houses are indifferently built and so constructed as to allow insufficient air space between the floor line and the ground, and, in some cases, the floor line is beneath the level of the path, air space being the more necessary in this district, having regard to the nature of the ground just referred to. Thirdly, the population of the District, compared with the rest of Plumstead, is dense, and consists of a poorer and, in some streets, lower class than the adjoining parts of the Parish. 155 These aro causes of insanitation for which the Sanitary Authority cannot in any way be held responsible, and which they are unable to entirely remove. But there is another and, in the opinion of the Committee, a far more serious, reason for the condition of this area, and that is the insufficiency of the London County Council Main Sewer, and the incapacity of their pumping apparatus to prevent at times of excessive rain, a backing up of the sewage in the Parish sewers, and the consequent surcharge of the drains leading into them. The Vestry's Surveyor, at the request of the Committee, specially inspected the London County Council's Sewer, and the Parish Sewers in this District on the 4th December, 1895, after a fairly heavy rainfall, and found 2 ft. 8 in. of sewage in the manhole at the west end of Reidhaven Road; the same state of things was also found to exist at the Council's Outfall Sewer at Crossness, the consequence being a backing up of sewage in the Parish Sewers and the drains leading into them. The Surveyor further reported that, in his opinion, it was impossible to make any marked improvement in the drainage levels owing to the low-lying District, and that the real remedy was the construction of a duplicate or other sufficient sewer contemplated by the London County Council, and increased pumping power at Crossness, We are informed that the Metropolitan Board of Works approved one of the sewers in this district, notwithstanding the strenuous opposition of the Committee's predecessors in office. The Surveyor's Report further recommended as to the Reidhaven Road Sewer, that 30 feet run, at the east end of Reidhaven Road, should be taken up and relaid, and that certain alterations should be made to three manholes on this Sewer, also that 50 feet run of Hartville Road Sewer should be taken up and relaid, and alterations made to three other 156 manholes in this locality. The whole of the work contained in these recommendations has been carried out since the date of the Medical Officer's Report. Further, the Vestry, on the recommendation of the Committee, directed a letter to be written to the London County Council with an extract from the Surveyor's Report, and this was sent on 23rd December, 1896, and the London County Council in due course replied that the work of increasing the pumping power at Crossness was being proceeded with as rapidly as possible, and that they were contemplating the formation of a storm water outlet for the Southern Outfall at Greenwich. No doubt when these alterations are completed the improvement shewn in the health of this area in 1896, will be more than maintained. It is important to note that the proportion of notifiable infectious diseases indicated on the official maps issued by the Metropolitan Asylums Board with their Report for 1896, as coming from this district, bears a most favourable comparison with the rest of the Parish. The statistics in the Medical Officer's Report for this Reidhaven Road District show that the death rate for 1896 was 16.8, as opposed to 15.6 for the whole Parish, shewing an excess only of 1.2 per 1000, and in the cases of all classes of disease specified in his Report, having regard to the smallness of the figures, and also to the character of the district as already stated, the proportion which this district bears to the whole of Plumstead is not abnormal. The statistics as to Enteric Fever given by the Medical Officer, if taken for 1896 only, do not show, as is stated in his 157 Report, that this disease is three-times as prevalent in the Reidhaven Road District as in Plumstead as a whole, but that it is not even twice as much so, and this proportion has no significance when regard is had to the very small figures upon which it is based, namely, 3 only in this district, and 29 in Plumstead. His statement can only be sustained by coupling 1894 with 1896, which cannot possibly be a fair means of ascertaining the present health of this district. All the recommendations that the Medical Officer has brought before the Committee since his report for the registration of houses occupied by two or more families in this district with the view to prevent overcrowding and to enforce cleanliness have been adopted. Since 31st December, 1896, the Vestry have resolved to appoint an additional Sanitary Inspector which will enable the Committee to divide the parish into three districts, and if necessary give special attention to this Reidhaven Road area. Measles. 3. Although there were more deaths from Measles than in recent years, the Committee are unable, in consequence of its not being a notifiable disease, to state whether it was more prevalent in the Parish, or whether the increased mortality was due only to the severity of the attack. All that can be done to diminish the danger arising from Measles has been done by the Committee, and the recommendations of the Medical Officer upon the subject adopted, and large bills posted up giving hints and instructions for treatment. f Further, the Committee did all in their power to persuade the School Board for London to alter their Regulations as to Children suffering from Infectious Diseases, or living at houses 158 where such diseases exist, especially Diphtheria and Measles, so that notification of any case of Measles not otherwise notifiable might be sent direct to the School Board Visitor or the Vestry's Medical Officer, and the Committee recommended the printing of the necessary forms for this purpose, but, although several applications were made, the School Board would not sanction the suggested alterations. Nuisances and their Abatement. 4. The Sanitary Inspectors in 1896 served 1663 Intimation Notices, and of these only 366 were reported as not attended to. In everyone of these cases the Committee ordered service of Statutory Notices, to be followed by proceedings if necessary. It appears, however, from paragraph 64 of the Medical Officer's Report that it was found necessary to serve only 307 of these Statutory Notices, and it is satisfactory to note that in 16 cases only summonses had to be issued, and that in 7 out of this number the work was done upon service of the summons, without the necessity of obtaining a Magistrate's order. In addition to the above the Sanitary Inspectors reported 145 cases of non-compliance with notices to supply dust receptacles. It was, however, found necessary to take proceedings in 6 cases only, and in each of these the requisite receptacle was provided without a penalty being enforced. The Committee cannot therefore agree with the statement in paragraph 59 of the Medical Officer's Report that the parties liable have treated the Vestry with contempt, and have paid no attention to their formal demands. Combined Dbains. 5 The Inspectors have reported upon a large number of defective combined drains. In all cases where it has been necessary the Vestry resolved upon the recommendation of the 159 Committee to serve the necessary notices, and take the requisite steps to secure the repair of such drains, and in not one single instance has it been necessary in order either to secure the work being done, or to recover the cost, to issue a summons. Prosecution under Public Health and Food and Drugs Acts. 6. The Committee have directed prosecutions in all other cases of infringement of the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the Sale of Food and Drugs Act where the Vestry's Officers have advised that prosecutions were likely to be successful. Twelve only of the cases in which prosecutions were instituted under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, are set out in Table X. of the Appendix to the Medical Officer's Report, but during the year there has been a total of 33 and in all of these cases either the Committee's request was complied with or convictions obtained. The Committee considered Certificates of Food analyses of which there were six cases of adulteration and in each of these the offenders were prosecuted and convicted. Dust Collection. 7. Into the few complaints of neglect or non-compliance with the terms of Contract for Dust Collection, enquiry has been made by the Committee, and the Contractor called upon for an explanation. For better facilitating the work, the hours of collection were altered, to commence at 7 a.m. instead ef 6 a.m., and to cease at 6 p.m. instead of 5 p.m., during the summer months. The necessary public announcement has been made under the London County Council's Bye-laws for a daily collection in High Street and Plumstead Road, 160 Dust Inspector. 8. On the Medical Officer's Report that Mr. Hale, the Dust Inspector, was suSering from pronounced nervous debility, and was not, and was Dever again likely to be fit to discharge his duties, and that he had been absent nearly 4 months during the last 18 months, Inspector Hale was asked to tender his resignation; on his refusal to do so, the Vestry dispensed with his services. The Committee did not think it necessary to recommend the appointment of another Dust Inspector, but, as already pointed out in this Report, another Sanitary Inspector will shortly be appointed. The Assistant Sanitary Clerk, referred to in paragraph 67 of the Medical Officer's Report, was a boy clerk, at a salary of 7/- a week, and he was superseded in September, 1892, by the present Committee Clerk, Mr. Ellis, and only kept on temporarily for a few months. So that it is not correct to say that the Sanitary Staff has been reduced by two. It is also important to notice that the Parish has a specially appointed Food and Drugs Inspector. The duties of this office in most parishes are now generally carried out by Sanitary Inspectors, the work of the Sanitary Staff in this Parish is therefore lightened by this Parish having a separate Inspector for Food and Drugs. 9. The Committee has spent considerable time in dealing with other matters and with other reports and suggestions of the Medical Officer, and in every case where it has been deemed to be in the interest of the Public Health, his advice has been acted upon so far as the Committee were advised that they were legally able to do so. 161 Amongst many other matters the following have engaged the attention of the Committee. A new Health Refuge has been erected in Parkdale Road, and is now in charge of Mr. Winchcombe, and ready for occupation by inhabitants when necessary. The Committee have on several occasions urged the necessity for the construction of underground conveniences for both sexes, and the Vestry have now adopted their Recommendation and directed the preparation of plans for the erection of such a convenience. The Surveyor was instructed to report as to what further steps could be taken to prevent contamination (with human excreta) of water accessible to cows in the Marsh Ditches. The Surveyor reported fully, and made a number of recommendations to this end as set out in his Annual Report, all of which were recommended by this Committee and adopted by the Vestry. Water from the Kent Water Company's well in Brewery Road was analyzed and found to be organically pure. The Local Government Board were asked to analyze this water periodically and communicate the result to the Vestry, and in reply a statement was received, showing the results of the analyses of 6 samples of water collected from the Plumstead Well of the Kent Water Works Company on the following dates:—2nd October, 1893; 6th December, 1893; 3rd August, 1894; 1st April, 1895; 2nd December, 1895, and 1st August, 1896. All the samples were certified to be clear and colourless, of great organic purity, and those taken on and after 3rd August, 1894, were stated to be of excellent quality for dietetic purposes. L 162 The Works Committee were recommended to construct a Tank to receive White Hart Lane Sewer overflow. A Contract for making a new Sewer has however since been signed. Rules for prevention of Puerperal Fever were printed and issued to Midwives, but the Committee were not able to adopt the Medical Officer's suggestions to print (1) Large posters recommending revaccination of persons after reaching 12 years of age; (2) Handbills for distribution by Medical Practitioners, giving directions for prevention of Phthisis; (3) Directions as to Infant Feeding; as the Committee were advised they would not be legally justified in interfering with the responsibility of the Guardians, nor in incurring expense in circulating the Medical Officer's opinion as to Consumption and Infant Feeding. Dated this 7th day of July, 1897. Signed on behalf of the Committee, ARTHUR B. BRYCESON, Chairman. 163 Surveyor's Report to General Purposes Committee with reference to Annual Report of Medical Ofticer for 1896. 8th July, 1897. Gentlemen, Since your last meeting I have received a printed copy (unbound) from the Vestry Clerk, of the Medical Officer's Annual Report for 1896, and in accordance with your request I beg to make the following remarks which I consider affect my Committee, i.e., Works Committee. In the first place I must observe, the Medical Officer has spent much valuable time in producing such an elaborate report, and I feel very diffident in being called upon to comment thereon, even though it affects my own department. Until paragraph 42 is reached I have nothing to say, but in portions of this paragraph, as in others that will follow on, I cannot quite agree with the Medical Officer. He states that sewage finds its way into the White Hart Lane Sewer overflow. This certainly takes place during storms, and has done so for many years. But during the time the storm overflow comes into operation the sewage is very much diluted. The obstruction he speaks of was reported on by me to the Public Health Committee, 4th March, 1896 (see Surveyor's Report Book, No. 5, page 29). Such obstruction might take place in any sewer unless the entrances to same are under lock and key, for, no doubt, the obstruction was wilfully done. 164 In the most modern drainage works such storm over-flows are constructed, and whoever advised one in this position did a wise thing. As for the diversion of the storm overflow into the Southern Outfall Sewer, I do not agree that the idea sprung from the Medical Officer. It originated from the Works Department in connection with a scheme being entered into by the Vestry and the South Eastern Railway Company for the construction of a bridge and roadway. As regards the various level ditches, the Parish ones are weeded, mudded, and kept clean, so that a circulation in such flat levels can be continuously going on. Ventilation of Sewers (Paragraph 43). I am sorry the Medical Officer has said so much on this. The scheme has only lately been reported on by me and is yet in its infancy, but is being rapidly and beneficially extended. Mortuary (Paragraph 46). Plans are prepared and the Vestry are waiting for new road and sewer, the construction of which, hinges on the bridge about to be constructed by the South Eastern Railway Company. House Inspection, Drainage, &c. (Paragraph 56). I consider it very injudicious that Mabyn and Hartville Roads should be singled out as being two of the poorest streets in the Parish. The main drainage for these roads I consider good. 165 I examined Glenside Road Sewer on the 5th inst. and found it as I always have done, viz.:—doing its work well, and when Marmadon, Brookdene, and Bannockburn Roads (north end of the latter) are built upon, this sewer will be the more self-cleansing, as in the first instance it was designed to do this work. The Reidhaven Road Sewer is not so self-cleansing as the Glenside Road, but with ordinary flushing it is workable, and will be more so when the improvements to the Outfall works are carried out, which I understand are now in progress. Testing Drains (Paragraph 61). It is impracticable to test all new drains with the water test, no drains are allowed to be covered over until the joints have been inspected and tested by means of the smoke test, which I consider quite sufficient, except in very special cases. Until I have positive proof I doubt the remarks made by the Medical Officer in this paragraph. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, W. C. GOW, Surveyor to the Vestry. Woolwich: H.
