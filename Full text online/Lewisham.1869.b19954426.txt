Gentlemen, In accordance with the provisions of the 43rd section of the Metripolis Local Management Act, I have again the honour of laying before you my report of the sanitary state of the Lewisham District. In table I. (see p. 25) I have given the enumerated population for 1851 and 1861; The estimated population, calculated logarithmally, to the middle of 1(which will probaby he found incorrect, in consequence of the irregular and diminished population in some parts); The estimated population at so many per house, taking the number per house in 1861 (the last census); The number of inhabited houses, 1851 census; The number of inhabited houses, 1861 census; The number of inhabited houses rated at £20 and under in the middle of 1869; The number of inhabited houses rated above £20 in the middle of 1689; The total number of inhabited houses at the middle of 1869; The average number of persons per house, 1851 census; The average number of persons per house, 1861 census; The average mortality per 1000, assuming a population obtained from the number per house in 1861, and the number of inhabited houses in 1869. During the year 1868 the mortality of the whole of London amounted to 77,933, and the mortality was at the rate of nearly 25 per 1000. More than half of the deaths in London (41,584) occurred under 20 years of age. 6 Scarlet fever, whooping cough, and diarrhœa were the reigning epidemics of the year, and to them 12,958 deaths, or about one-sixth of the total mortality were referred. Table II. (see p. 20), compiled from the Registrar General's summary of weekly returns for 1869, gives the population of London and thirteen other large towns, together with the rate of mortality. In table III. I give the population of Hampstead (a similar district to that of Lewisham), estimated logarithmally with the number of deaths, and the rate of mortality per 1000. TABLE III.

In table IV. I give you the number of births and deaths in the different Registrar's sub-districts in Lewisham Parish and the Hamlet of Penge, comprising together the Lewisham District, with the mortality of the several public institutions.

The census will next year determine this point; but in the meantime I have from year to year endeavoured to give this approximately, by ascertaining the number of inhabited houses from the rate book at the middle of the year, and calculating the number of inhabitants at the rate per house which existed at the census of 1861, which is no doubt the most correct manner of getting at the facts of the case. I have given, however, as a comparative table, the population calculated logarithmally, supposing that the same increase had continued as was found to have taken place between the census of 1851 and the census of 1861. One or other of these plans is the only method by which the population of London or any other English city can be obtained between the decenniads; and as all tables must be calculated upon this basis, the comparative mortality of different districts is more to be relied upon than would at first be supposed. As a corrective statement, it should be mentioned that when calculating the mortality of this district it must be taken into account that in Penge there is a school—the North Surrey District School—where a population of 1000 children reside, aged from 2 to 16, amongst whom the mortality does not average half per cent. 9 per annum, whereas Lewisham Village contains the Union Workhouse, where the sick, the decrepit, and aged poor are congregated, and where a large proportionate mortality always obtains. An analysis of the tables of mortality, as well as information as to the sickness of the district, shows us that the district suffered from epidemic disease in 1869, though not to an equal extent with that of the previous year: the prevailing epidemic having been scarlet fever. From my own observation, 1 am of opinion that a more rigid inspection of houses in the district is advisable, to show whether they are all property drained into the main sewers constructed in various parts of the district, and to sec that old drains, cesspools, or receivers are away with where practicable. It appears to be sometimes the case, that although sewers arc constructed, drainage into them is avoided, and that the old form of drainage exists. Constant observation proves also (as I have before mentioned) that the drainage of houses should be as much as possible external to them: that the soil pipes from closets should be outside the buildings; that the pipes from sinks should never be allowed to enter the drain; and that the overflow pipes from cisterns should never be connected with a closet or sewer. There is much need in the district, as I have explained in former reports, of a steam oven or other apparatus for disinfecting the clothes, linen, bedding, &c., of those who are or have been suffering from epidemic disease. Especially amongst the poor, no means exist for stopping contagion, and disease is constantly fostered and spread from infected bedding and clothing. Even amongst the better classes, infected apparel is constantly sent to be washed (a process which does not disinfect), and is mixed with the linen, &c., sent from the houses of the healthy; and this is another means by which disease may be distributed. As a precautionary means during the hot weather, when putrefactive fermentation would be most rapid, the gullies were supplied with water with which carbolic acid was mixed. The antiputrescent properties of this disinfectant were very useful in allaying the offensive smell arising from the sewers. It would be well if the public generally would use this substance more extensively in their houses, as its constant and 10 extensive use would render the atmosphere of drains and sewers very much more wholesome. During the year the Cow and Slaughter Houses have been frequently inspected. The Bakehouses have also received attention, and the Workshops have been frequently visited. ON THE NATURE OF SCARLET FEVER AND THE BEST MEANS OF PREVENTING IT. Scarlet Fever is a highly contagious disease, and spreads from one person to another, and is thus propagated in families, towns, and districts. It is therefore highly desirable that every one should understand the nature of this disease, and the means of preventing it spreading. It is always attended with a scarlet eruption of the skin, and is mostly accompanied by a sore throat. Whenever children have sore throats, or an eruption of the skin, they should be separated from the rest of the family until a doctor has seen them, or these symptoms have disappeared. There is every reason to believe that during the progress of this disease, not only the eruption of the skin, but everything that is thrown off the body of the infected person is heavily laden with the germs or seeds which are capable of propagating this disease to another person. The discharges from the nose and throat are especially virulent. There is also every reason to believe that the discharges from the bowels are the same. The kidneys are frequently dangerously diseased in Scarlet Fever, and the secretion from these organs is also probably highly contagious. The power of spreading the poison by means of these secretions is not confined to their immediately leaving the body, but continues long after. It is on this account that when these secretions have found their way to the cesspool and sewer, that they may still give off poison to the surrounding air, and persons breathing it may become infected. Taking these tilings into consideration, it will be necessary, if possible, to destroy and annihilate this poison before it leaves the room where the person is whose body has produced it. 11 The following directions should in all cases be carried into deffect:— 1.—The room should be cleared of all needless woollen or other draperies which might possibly serve to harbour the poison. 2.—A basin, charged with carbolate of lime, Macdougall's or Calvert's Powder, or some other convenient disinfectant, should be kept constantly on the bed for the patient to spit into. 3.—A large vessel containing water impregnated with chloride of zinc, or with Condy's (1oz. to 1 gallon of water), should always stand in the room for the reception of all bed and body linen immediately on its removal from the patient, 4.—Pocket handkerchiefs should not be used, and small pieces of rag employed for wiping the month and nose. Each piece, after being once used, should be immediately burnt. 5.— As the hands of nurses of necessity become frequently soiled by the secretions, a good supply of towels and two basins-one containing water with Condy's Fluid or carbolate of lime, and another with plain soap and water— should be always at hand for the immediate removal of the taint. 6.—All glasses, cups, or other vessels used by or about the patient should be scrupulously cleaned before being used by others. 7.—The discharges from the bowels and kidneys should be received on their very issue from the body into vessels charged with disinfectants (carbolate of lime). By these measures the greater part of the germs which are thrown of by internal surfaces may be robbed of their power to propagate the disease. The poisonous germs that are thrown off from the skin require a somewhat different treatment. The plan recommended for the purpose of preventing the poison from the skin being disseminated through the air is to put oil all over the skin. This practice is to commence on the fourth day after the appearance of 12 the eruption, and to he continued every day until the patient is well enough to take a warm bath, in which the whole person is well washed with disinfecting carbolic acid soap and warm water. These baths should be administered every other day for four times, when the disinfection of the skin may be regarded as complete. This proceeding should not, however, be adopted without consulting the medical man who is in attendance on the patient. Speaking of the plans above recommended, Dr. Budd says— "The success of this method in my own hands has been very markable. For a period of nearly 20 years, during which I have employed it in a very wide field, I have never known the disease spread in a single instance beyond the sick room, and in very few instances within it. Time after time I have treated this fever in houses crowded from attic to basement with children and others, who have nevertheless escaped infection. The two elements in the method are—separation on the one hand, and disinfection on the other." ON THE NATURE OF TYPHOID OR DRAIN FEVER, AND THE BEST MEANS OF PREVENTING IT. This fever is called Drain Fever from its constant association with bad and imperfect drainage in houses. It is called Gastric Fever from its chief seat being in the stomach and bowels. At one time it was confounded with Typhus fever, and is similar to that disease in many respects; hence it is called Typhoid Fever. It is also called Low Fever, from the great exhaustion and weakness which attends it. The means by which this disease may be prevented are very simple, and depend upon the fact that the poison by which it spreads is almost entirely contained in the discharges from the bowels. Dr. W. Budd gives the following excellent directions for preventing the spread of this disease. He says the discharges from the bowels infect— 1.—The sick room. 2.—The bed and body linen of the patient. 3.—The privy and the cesspool, or the drains proceeding from them. 13 From the privy or the drain the poison often soaks into the well and infects the drinking water. This last, when it happens, is of all forms of fever poisoning the most deadly. In these various way, the infection proceeding from the bowel discharges often spreads the disease far and wide. The one great thing to aim at, therefore, is to disinfect these discharges on their very escape from the body, and before they are carried from the sick room. This may be perfectly done by the use of disinfectants. One of the best is made of green copperas. This substance is very cheap, and may be had everywhere. A pound and a half of green copperas to a gallon of water is proper strength. A teacupful of this liquid put into the nightpan every time before it is lined by the patient renders the bowel discharge perfectly harmless. To disinfect the bed and body linen and bedding generally, MacDougall's Powder is more convenient. This powder should be sprinkled by means of dredger on soiled spots on the linen, and about the room to purify the air. All articles of bed and body linen should be plunged immediately on their removal from the bed into a bucket of water containing a tablespoonful of chloride of zinc or McDougall's Powder, and should be boiled before being washed. The privy or closet, and all drains communicating with it, should be flushed twice daily with the green copperas liquid or carbolic acid diluted with water. In the event of death, the body should be placed as soon as possible in a coffin, surrounded with charcoal sprinkled with carbolic acid. Early burial is on all accounts desirable. In towns and villages where the fever is already prevalent the last rule should be put in force for all houses, whether there be fever in them or not, and for all public drains. As the hands of those attending on the sick often become unavoidably soiled by the discharge- from the bowels, they should be frequently washed. The sick room should be kept well ventilated day and night. The greatest possible care should be taken with regard to the drinking water. Where there is the slightest risk of its having become tainted with fever poison, water should be got from a pure source, and should be boiled and filtered before being drunk. Immediately after the illness is over, whether ending in death or recovery, the dresses worn by the nurses should be washed or destroyed, and the bed and room occupied by the sick should be thoroughly disinfected. These are golden rules; where they are 14 neglected the fever may become a deadly scourge; where they are strictly carried out it seldom spreads beyond the person first attacked. A yard of thin wide-width gutta percha placed under the blanket under the breach of the patient, by effectually preventing the discharges from soaking into the bed, is a great additional safeguard. Medical men and others are invited to report any case of infectious disease at the office of the Board of Works, Lewisham, in order that the Sanitary Inspector may inspect the drains, and see to the general sanitary condition of the house in which the fever occurs. FACTS AND REASONS IN FAVOUR OF VACCINATION AND THE VACCINATION LAWS. By Dr. Lankester. I.—Persons who have once had the small pox are not liable to take it a second time. In the last century inoculation of small pox was practised, because it was known that small pox thus communicated was usually milder than when caught naturally. II.—Cow pox is a modified form of small pox, and it has been clearly proved that those who have had it are very much less liable to take small pox than others, and are as effectually protected as those who have already had small pox. III.—Cow pox is communicated by vaccination. Jenner discovered that persons who had caught cow pox from the cow escaped small pox, and thus was led to advise vaccination. IV.—Forty-five millions of the people of Europe died from small pox during the hundred years preceding the introduction of vaccination at the beginning of this century, whilst not more than two millions have died from this disease during the seventy years in which vaccination has been practised. In London before the introduction of vaccination, every tenth death was due to small pox ; now only one death in every eighty-five is due to this disease. Even greater difference has been observed in other towns and cities of 15 Europe; as in Trieste, where the deaths from small pox have boon seventy-five times less since than before vaccination; in Moravia, twenty-one times less; in Silesia, twentynine times less; in Westphalia, twenty-five times less; and in Berlin, nineteen times less. When vaccination has been stringently enforced, death from small pox has been still more diminished. In Ireland, where this disease was once a scourge, it has now become almost unknown, and the same good result has been obtained in many districts of India. When small pox has been rife among the inhabitants of a city, or district, it has been repeatedly observed that the unvaccinated have perished, and the vaccinated survived or altogether escaped. Very carefully kept records in hundreds of places in Europe and elsewhere have proved this. Out of thirty vaccinated nurses constantly employed in the small pox hospital, not one ever contracted the small pox; of the patients admitted to this hospital from 1836 to 1851, thirtyseven in the hundred of those unvaccinated died; whilst only six in the hundred who have been vaccinated (well or badly) died. V.—In England there is a larger proportion of unvaccinated persons than in any other country of Europe, and consequently a greater number of deaths from small pox are shown by the public registration to occur. VI.—Whilst small pox kills so great a proportion of the unvaccinated whom it attacks, the inoculation of cow pox, i.e., vaccination, seldom or ever produces any consequences of an injurious nature. The authenticated fatal cases of erysipelas so produced are not more numerous than those that follow the prick of a pin. There is no proof that those who have been vaccinated sutler from scrofula or any similar disease as a consequence of vaccination alone. According to the Registrar General's returns these diseases have diminished in frequency since the introduction of vaccination. That which follows after a thing is not necessarily caused by it. It is a matter of necessity that persons who have been vaccinated should have diseases after this operation as well as before it, but these cannot be rightly attributed to vaccination. 16 VII.—The laws of our country demand that every one should be vaccinated, because persons who are unvaccinated are liable to take small pox and die. The law does not allow the right of a man to catch small pox or to expose his children to it, as it docs not allow him to kill himself or his children. It has been recently made unlawful for a man to accumulate dirt and filth which may become the means of spreading disease and death among his neighbours; and similarly the law does not allow a man to make his body, or those of his children, hot beds for the development of the deadly small pox which may spread to his neighbours. VIII.—Although very rarely the eruptions of other diseases have, through the carelessness of medical practitioners, been mistaken for cow pox, yet it would be as reasonable to ask for the abolition of railways because of railway accidents as to demand the abolition of vaccination on account of accidental occurences. IX.—The great means whereby small pox may be wholly exterminated is universal vaccination. X.—Small pox is one of the greatest curses to man, whilst vaccination is one of his greatest blessings. ON INFECTIOUS OR CATCHING DISEASES, AND THE LEGAL MEANS OF PREVENTING THEIR SPREADING. Extracts from the Sanitary Act. 1.—Catching or infectious diseases are scarlet fever, small pox, typhus, typhoid, and relapsing fevers and measles. 2.—By the Sanitary Act of 1866 a penalty of £5 is inflicted on any person who wilfully or negligently is the means of spreading infectious or contagious diseases among their friends or neighbours. 3.—It is illegal to use any public cab for the conveyance of a patient to a hospital or anywhere else without telling the driver that it is a case of infectious disease. 17 4.—The driver of a cab may refuse to take any such person unless he is paid a sum of money sufficient to defray the expenses of disinfecting his cab. 5—Any cabman taking another fare after conveying an infected person without previously disinfecting his cab, is liable to a penalty of £5. 6.—It is illegal for an infected person to go, or for any person to take or send any one suffering from an infections disease to any public place, such as the waiting room of a hospital or dispensary, or to a school, or a church, or a chapel, or a theatre, or omnibus or other public carriage, so as to endanger any other persons, whether adults or children. 7.— It is also illegal for any person to give, lend, or sell, or move to another place, or expose, any bedding, clothing, rags, or other things, which may have become infected, and are liable to convey any contagious diseases to another person, unless such things have been previously disinfected. 8.—It is also illegal to let any house, room, or part of a house, in which any person has been ill with any dangerous infectious disease, until it and all articles in it have been properly disinfected. The same law also applies to public houses, hotels, and lodging houses.

Gentlemen, I have to report, pursuant to your instructions, upon the works carried out under my supervision during the past year. SEWERS. Upwards of 3,936 feet run of pipe sewers and upwards of 7,236 feet run of brick Hewers have been constructed in the District during the year in the following localities, viz.: in Court Hill Road and Ryecroft Road 900ft. of 3ft. x 2ft. brick sewer. 1862ft. of 15in. pipe sewer. 914ft. of 12in. pipe sewer. Canterbury Road and Ravensbonrne Villas 880ft. of 15in. pipe sewer. 280ft. of 12in „ Also Catford Hill and Perry Vale Sewer 3562ft. of 3ft.9in. x 2ft. 6in. brick sewer. 2774ft. of 3ft. 0in. x 2ft. 0in. „ „ The sewer in Court Hill Road, &c., was executed at the expense of the owners of property at a cost of £1,023 5s. 6d., and a considerable number of the houses were drained into the same, and proceedings are being taken to enforce the drainage of the remainder. The Canterbury Road sewer cost £228 11s. 4d.; and the sum of £90 was contributed by the owners of the property towards the cost of the same. The cost of the sewer in and along Perry Vale was £3,596 17s. 6d., and was defrayed by a loan. This sewer will be of great benefit to this rapidly increasing locality, and will secure the efficient drainage from the surrounding neighbourhood, as other main sewers will be connected therewith from the several new streets. In addition to the sewers executed by the Board, several have been applied for by owners of property, viz.:— Maberley Road, Belvedere Road, Penge. Fairland Park, Lower Sydenham. Sabin's Lane, Catford Hill. 24 Devonshire Road and Tyson Road, Forest Hill. Glenmore Road, College Park Estate. Bonfield Road (part only). And received the sanction of your Hoard and that of the Metropolitan Board, and were constructed under my superintendence, in order that the same should he constructed of the necessary levels and of proper materials, as it is important that a uniformity should be maintained in connection with the outlet sewers laid down by this Board and the Metropolitan Board. HOUSE DRAINAGE. The following is a list of the number of houses built and drained during the past year:— Number of Houses applied to be built—drains in most cases already executed. Number of Houses permanently drained during the past year. Number of Houses drained into Cesspools during the past year. 450 506 76 Total number of houses drained—582. PROJECTIONS, STREET FRONTAGES, &c. A duty of considerable importance devolving upon the Board is that of considering the applications for street frontages, &c., of which thirty-seven cases have been under consideration during the past year. In a great many instances, but for the attention paid to this important subject, examples of construction would have occurred to the great prejudice of public convenience and comfort. NUISANCES. An important duty devolving upon the Board is that of the abatement of nuisances; and, in conjunction with the Inspector, a great number have been inspected, and proceedings taken to enforce the removal of the same. I am, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, W. H. TREVERTON, Sewers Surveyor. REPORT BY SURVEYOR OF HIGHWAYS Of works executed from Lady-day, 1869, to Lady-day, 1870.
