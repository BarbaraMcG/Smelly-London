STRUTHERS, Medical Officer of Health 7 SECTION 1. General Information and Statistical Summary. General. Holborn, with an area of 405 acres, is the smallest of the Metropolitan Boroughs. It is about miles long, extending from Tottenham Court Road in the West to Farringdon Road in the East, and averages about half a mile in width. Soil.—Most of the Borough is covered with Taplow Gravel to a depth of between 10 and 20 feet overlaying London Clay which varies in thickness from about 40 - 60 feet in the North of the Borough to about 80 - 100 feet in the South. In the North East corner there is a small area of London Clay without gravel cover, and in the extreme South East the London Clay is covered with brickearth. There is a deposit of alluvium in the valley of the old Fleet River in the extreme East of the Borough. Typical Sections are:— 1. Tottenham Court Road Drift (i.e. including Taplow Gravels) 22½ feet. London Clay 63½ feet. 2. Grays Inn Made Soil 7 feet. Gravel 9½ feet. London Clay 40½ feet. 3. Lincoln's Inn Made Soil 13 feet. Gravel 5 feet. London Clay 113 feet. 4. Bernard Street Made Soil 10 feet. Sand and Gravel 11½ feet London Clay 46 feet.

The London County Council, as Local Health Authority, is responsible under Section 27 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, for the provision of ambulance facilities within the Administrative County of London. The Home Service Ambulance Department (Order of St. John of Jerusalem and British Red Cross Society) and the Hospital Car Service act as agents of the County Council in supplying some of the ambulance and car transport provided under the Act. The Headquarters of the London Ambulance Service are at The County Hall, Westminster Bridge, S.E.1. Ambulances may be summoned as follows:— (1) Accidents— Sudden illness in the streets, public places or places of employment. (Note—For sudden illness in the home a doctor, not an ambulance, should be summoned.) Dial "999" (or follow the instructions given on the telephone instrument) and ask for— "AMBULANCE." (2) Maternity patients (who have booked a bed in a hospital or maternity home)— Very urgent illness in the home (provided a medical practitioner certifies that the case is one of life or death and arrangements have been made with a hospital for the patient's admission). Telephone— WATerloo 6000 CENtral 0301 REGent 4000 RELiance 3622 or NEW Cross 2645 10 (3) Illness, infectious disease, etc.— Normally the hospital to which the patient is to be admitted will summon the ambulance, if one is necessary, by telephoning WATerloo 3311. This applies also to patients being discharged from hospital or attending there as out-patients. Emergency Bed Service. (King Edward's Hospital Fund for London). The Emergency Bed Service was founded in 1938 to assist general practitioners in finding beds for acute emergency cases. Since the 5th July, 1948, the Service, working in close co-operation with the Ambulance Service, has acted as agent for the four Metropolitan Regional Hospital Boards for the admission of all types of cases except mental and tuberculous. The Central Office of the Emergency Bed Service removed from Old Jewry to 28, London Bridge Street, S.E.1, on 1st June, 1954, and the telephone number was changed from MONarch 3000 to HOP 7181. On the 8th June, 1954, the branch offices were closed and all calls are now made direct to Central Office. 11 SECTION 2. Births and Deaths. STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR 1954. Population.

The numbers of either males or females who have died of pulmonary tuberculosis have not shewn any uniform trend during these last nine years. The numbers of deaths from malignant neoplasm of the lung or bronchus are of interest in view of trends shewn by national figures. The Table does however show the higher incidence in men for both diseases, and that over the last three years these neoplasms have produced a wastage of life greater than that of pulmonary tuberculosis. 17 SECTION 3.

Notifications. During the year 133 cases of infectious disease were notified, of which 49 were removed to hospital. These are tabulated in the age groups (see Table No. 6, page 20). Comparative figures of infectious disease for the years 1922-1954 are also shown (see Table No. 7, pages 22 and 23). Diphtheria. It is very gratifying to report that for the fourth year in succession no case of diphtheria was notified. Dysentery. Thirty-four cases were notified and nine were removed to hospital. Enteric Fever. Two cases of typhoid fever were notified and one was removed to hospital. In neither case was the source of infection in this Borough. Erysipelas. One case was notified and was treated at home. Food Poisoning. Two cases were notified, one of which was removed to hospital. Malaria. One primary case of malignant tertian malaria was notified and was removed to hospital. The patient, who was on a four months' visit to this country from Uganda, was ill on arrival, and had obviously contracted the disease abroad. Measles. Thirty-eight cases were notified and four were removed to hospital. One case removed to hospital was subsequently re-diagnosed as bronchitis. Meningococcal Infection. One case was notified and was removed to hospital. 19 Pneumonia (Acute Primary and Acute Influenzal). Four cases were notified, and one was removed to hospital. Poliomyelitis. Three cases were notified, all of which were removed to hospital. Only one of these cases was a Holborn resident. Puerperal Pyrexia. No cases were notified during the year. Scabies. One case was notified, and was treated at home. Scarlet Fever. Six cases were notified, and three of them were removed to hospital. One case removed to hospital was subsequently re-diagnosed as tonsillitis. Smallpox. In October information was received of a ship from Bombay arriving at Glasgow with a case of suspected smallpox on board. Three passengers presumed to be contacts had proceeded to addresses in Holborn, but before they could be contacted further information was received that the case was not one of smallpox. Tuberculosis. See page 51. Whooping Cough. Seven cases were notified, three of which were removed to hospital. One case removed to hospital was subsequently re-diagnosed as upper respiratory tract infection. Other Diseases coming to the notice of the Department. Disease. No. of Cases. No. removed to Hospital.

The Borough Council provides bacteriological confirmation of diagnosis free of charge in connection with certain diseases. This work is carried out by the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene, 23 Queen Square, W.C.1, and by the Public Health Laboratory Service at County Hall. During the year 190 specimens were submitted for examination with the following results:— Disease. Positive. Negative. Total. Diphtheria (Nasal and throat swabs). — 10 10 Dysentry (Faeces) (Faecal swabs) 12 30 42 33 86 119 Food Poisoning (Faeces). — 3 3 Streptococcus haemolyticus 2 1 3 Tuberculosis (Sputum). — 3 3 Vincents organisms 2 1 3 Whooping cough (Cough plates). — 2 2 Other pathogenic organisms 1 10 11 Infectious Disease Contacts. Where a person is precluded from continuing at work by reason of being a carrier or having been in contact with infectious disease, benefits under the National Insurance Act, 1946, are paid only on production of a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health. It was not found necessary to issue any such certificates during the year. International Certificates of Vaccination against Cholera and Smallpox. The International Sanitary Regulations adopted by the Fourth World Health Assembly on 25th May, 1951, prescribe inter alia that International Certificates, to be valid, must bear an approved stamp which certifies that the signature of the vaccinator is that of a doctor. During the year 224 certificates of persons travelling abroad were authenticated by the Department. Of these 219 were in respect of smallpox, 12 for cholera, and 2 for typhoid. Diphtheria Immunisation. During the year 135 Holborn residents completed immunisation against diphtheria. In all cases these were children. 22 23 TABLE 7 Comparative Figures of Infectious ???ease for the years 1922-1954.

Water for drinking and commercial purposes in this area is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and has been satisfactory both in quantity and quality. 2. There is a piped supply, and bacteriological examinations of the raw water are made by the Metropolitan Water Board, who also perform chemical analysis. 3. The water is not known to have any plumbo-solvent action. 4. No action has been necessary in respect of contamination. 5. All dwelling houses have a piped supply, and standpipes are normally used only in cases of emergency, such as repair of mains. No complaints, regarding unsatisfactory water being supplied for drinking purposes, were received during the year. Drainage. During the year 3,239 inspections were made by the Sanitary Inspectors in connection with drainage work; 101 applications for approval of proposed drainage work were submitted together with the necessary plans, and 94 Combined Drainage Orders were made. Smoke Abatement. During the year 30 complaints were received regarding smoke nuisances and 135 observations were made. In most cases, it was found that the nuisance was caused by unsatisfactory stoking, and conditions were remedied following advice being given by the District Sanitary Inspectors. During 1953, equipment for recording atmospheric pollution was set up on the roof of the British Museum. The equipment consists of a deposit gauge, and a lead peroxide instrument for measuring sulphur dioxide. The recordings obtained during 1954 are as follows:— Month. Rainfall. inches. pH value. Monthly deposit— Tons per sq. mile. Insoluble matter. Soluble matter. Total solids. Mg. of SO3/day collected by 100 sq. cm. of Batch A Pb02.

Accumulations of refuse on bombed sites present a considerable problem to local authorities. In very few cases are the accumulations such as to warrant the service of notice in respect of a "nuisance"; and there is also the difficulty of assessing responsibility for the accumulations. In 1949 the Council made a by-law governing fly tipping on vacant sites in the Borough, but considerable difficulty is experienced in tracing offenders. Sites cleared by Council, e.g., bedding removed 15 Sites cleared as a result of the service of notices under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 3 War-Time Reservoirs for Emergency Water Supplies. It has been agreed by the Home Office that the cost of cleansing emergency water tanks should rank for 75% grant under the Civil Defence Act, 1948, the remaining 25% of the cost to be borne by the London County Council as fire authority, and that the work of cleansing be done by the Metropolitan Borough Councils as agents for the London County Council, As a result of this arrangement seven emergency water tanks in Holborn were cleansed during the year.

The National Assistance Acts, 1948 and 1951, provide that, where certified by the Medical Officer of Health to be necessary for the purpose of securing the proper care and attention for persons who (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions, and (b) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention, a local authority may apply to a court of summary jurisdiction for an order to secure the removal of such aged and infirm persons. There were no cases arising during the year which called for action under the above Acts by the Public Health Department, but visits were made in connection with the voluntary removal of aged and infirm persons living alone, to hospitals or other places and in connection with the provision for such persons of home nursing and home help facilities. Burial of the Dead. Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, places upon the Borough Council the responsibility of causing to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died in the area, or been found dead in the area, in any case where it appears that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body are otherwise likely to be made. Such cases are those of persons who die in poor circumstances, and, with few exceptions, have no known relatives. 35 Hospital Management Committees and Boards of Governors of Teaching Hospitals have been asked by the Minister to exercise their powers to arrange and pay for the burial or cremation of such persons dying in hospital. This Circular does not apply to voluntary hospitals, of which there are two in the Borough, namely the French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue, and the Italian Hospital, Queen Square. During the year nine cases were dealt with, at a total cost of £102. 0s. 0d. of which £70. 4s. 2d. was recovered, leaving a net cost to the Council of £31. 15s. 10d. The cases had come to the notice of the Public Health Department from the following sources:— French Hospital 1 Coroner's Officer 4 Friends or Relatives of Deceased 4 Legal Proceedings. Nature of Offence. Action Taken Under. Result. Selling a loaf of bread containing a piece of material or cloth. Section 3 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. Fined £2.0.0. Council awarded £5.5.0. costs.

Council awarded £2.2.0. costs. 36 New Legislation. Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954. This Act came into force on the 30th August, 1954, and is in two main parts. The first gives additional powers for dealing with clearance areas and other houses liable to demolition, and lays down a new standard of fitness for human habitation. Part II authorises an increase of rent in respect of controlled dwelling houses where certain conditions concerning repairs are fulfilled. The Act also makes certain other amendments of the Rent Acts. It repeals section six of the principal Act which enabled local authorities to make bye-laws with respect to working class houses, and thereby repeals existing byelaws with respect to houses let in lodgings. In place power is given for securing fitness for occupation, including separate amenities, by the number of families accommodated and for preventing overcrowding in this type of accommodation. The Food and Drugs Amendment Act, 1954. This Act received Royal Assent on the 25th November, 1954. With the exception of the provisions of Section 28, which deals with the restriction of private slaughterhouses, and which came into effect on the 25th November, the Act does not come into operation until a date early in 1955 to be appointed by order of the Minister of Food. This delay is in order to give time for the consolidation of the Food and Drugs Amendment Act, 1954, with the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, the Food and Drugs (Milk, Dairies and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950, and the Slaughterhouses Act, 1954, and also for the making of Food Hygiene Regulations under the consolidation measure to replace Section 13 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, which the Food and Drugs Amendment Act, 1954, repeals. It is proposed to bring the consolidating Act and the Food Hygiene Regulations into force simultaneously. 37 SECTION 5. Factories. Most of the provisions of the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948, are administered by the Ministry of Labour and National Service through H.M. Factory Inspectors. The Sanitary Authority is charged with the duty of enforcing the legislation as to sanitary accommodation in all factories in its area, and, in those factories where mechanical power is not used, legislation with regard to cleanliness, overcrowding, temperature, ventilation, and drainage of floors. All factories must have an adequate supply of drinking water from a public main or some other source approved in writing by the Council. Particulars of inspections and other work carried out during 1954 are as follows: — Number of visits to:— Factories with mechanical power 163 Factories without mechanical power 24 Outworkers' rooms 8 Electrical stations and sites of building operations 96 Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948.

The Milk and Dairies Regulations require every Local Authority to keep a register of all persons carrying on the trade of distributor in their district and of all premises which are used as dairies. "Dairy" does not include a shop from which milk is supplied only in the properly closed and unopened vessels in which it is delivered to the shop, or 42 other place in which milk is sold for consumption on the premises only "Distributor" includes a purveyor of milk whether by wholesale or retail. Most distributors now sell milk in the bottles and cartons in which they receive it from the wholesaler, and consequently their premises are not required to be registered as dairies. Dairies registered during 1954 Nil Dairies on register at end of 1954 3 Distributors registered during 1953 7 Distributors removed from register during 1954 9 Distributors on register at end of 1954 65 Number of above distributors trading from premises outside Borough 25 Inspections made by Inspectors during 1954 61 Formal milk samples taken and submitted for analysis 151 Informal milk samples taken and submitted for analysis 6 During 1954, 151 formal and 6 informal samples of milk were taken.

Upon being satisfied that the relevant provisions of the Regulations are complied with; a Licensing Authority grant a dealer's licence to a distributor in respect of each of his premises within their area rrom which the designated milk is to be sold. Where a distributon holding a dealer's licence to use a special designation in respect of milk sold from premises in one area, wishes to sell milk within the area of another Licensing Authority, the latter authority may issue a dealer's supplementary licence authorising the use of the designation in their area.

The results in the grading suggested by the Ministry of Health were as follows:— Grade 1 46 Grade 2 10 Grade 3 5 Grade 4 1 One coloured ice and one iced lolly did not respond to the test. These samples were examined for the presence of faecal coli, which were found not to be present in 1 ml. of the samples. In the case of samples tailing within Grades 3 and 4, letters were sent to the vendors drawing their attention to the poor grading. In such cases where the ice cream was manufactured outside Holborn, details were also sent to the Medical Officers of Health of the areas concerned. The results of all examinations of their own products were for warded to the large manufacturers for their information. Licensed Premises.

The Holborn Clean Food Guild, which was formed in January, 1950, maintained its progress during 1954. During the year a further twenty-two applications were received for membership, and at the end of the year the Guild had a membership of 75, 10 of whom had been approved during 1954. The total membership was slightly less than in 1953, but this was primarily due to the fact that a number of businesses changed hands during the year. At the end of the year there remained 30 applicants in varying stages of progress towards the necessary standard required for registration. Five of these have since been registered during the current year, and eleven applications have had to be withdrawn owing to the inability of the applicants to bring their premises up to the Guild's Codes of Standard and Practice. Renewal of membership was requested from all the members eligible for re-election during the year, indicating their contined appreciation of the work of the Guild. In each case the necessary standard was found to be maintained, and the renewal of membership was granted. 51 SECTION 7. Tuberculosis.
