Hammlret of Mite End Old down ANNUAL REPORT UPON THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITION OF THE DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR 7879-80, BY MATTHEW CORNER, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. LONDON : PENNY & HULL, Steam Printers, 53, Leman Street, Whiteckapel, E 1881. REPORT. To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Gentlemen, I beg to submit the 24th Annual Report upon the Public Health and Sanitary condition of the Hamlet for the year 1879—1880 Births. The births registered were 4242, compared with 4123 and 4298 in the two previous years. The natural increase of population or excess of births over deaths was 1716, the birth rate was 38.5 per 1000 population, and that for the whole metropolis 36.4. The births for each Quarter are shown in Table I. The Birth rate, 38.5 per 1,000 population, maintains its high position—the Birth rate for the whole metropolis was 36.4 ; the number of births is further confirmatory of the estimated increase of population. The present population of the Hamlet I estimate at 120,000, but for the statistical purposes of the past three years I have, pending the forthcoming census, adopted a mean of 110,000. This rapidly increasing population is strongly suggestive of an increase of overcrowding with its inevitable attendant evils, and many instances have recently come under my notice. Deaths. The total number of deaths registered during the year was 2,526, showing an increase of 263 over the previous year, and a rate per 1,000 population of 22.96; this includes 281 which occurred in the Workhouses. 4 Although the annual rate of mortality, 22.9 per 1,000 population, is higher than that for the previous year, it bears favourable comparison with that for the whole metropolis, 23.25 per 1,000. The excess of deaths over the previous year was caused mainly by phthisis and other pulmonary affections, and by scarlet fever in the third Quarter of the year; measles and diphtheria were also considerably more fatal than in the previous year. Zymotic Diseases. See Table III.—Five deaths only occurred from small pox in private houses during the four Quarters, and of these one only occurred in the first three Quarters, and four in the Quarter ending March, 1880. I have no record of the number of deaths occurring in Hospitals to patients from this Hamlet from this disease. In corresponding period of last year there were eighteen deaths in private houses. As regards small pox, I have found difficulty in obtaining reliable statistics owing to the various authorities involved. I can, however, give from my own knowledge the number of non-pauper cases sent to Highgate, since it was determined by the Vestry to send them there, rather than to allow them to remain sources of infection within the Hamlet. Four guineas have to be paid for each patient for treatment and maintenance during the whole period of illness ; added to this there is the cost of transit. The Vestry is primarily liable for these charges, but may recover the amount from the persons afterwards. It is satisfactory to observe there were only five deaths at their own homes during the four quarters. I may add that since the above was written the cases are being mostly removed at the cost of the Common Poor Fund. During the four quarters included in this Report, there were only 7 cases sent to the Hospital at Highgate, at a cost of £29 8s. and conveyance. All the cases sent subsequently will come within the four quarters of the succeeding year. In all cases of small pox coming to our knowledge, whether the patients were treated at home or sent to Hospital, the rooms occupied by them were disinfected by a skilled person specially employed by the Vestry; the walls, where papered, being stripped, and ceilings, &c., lime-washed ; bedding, clothing, and all textile materials also being properly disinfected under supervision. 5 It is satisfactory to note, in the presence of increased population, that the death rate compares favourably with that for the whole metropolis; the rate from general mortality being lower, while that for infectious diseases is just the same as the average for the whole metropolis, and much lower than for many other metropolitan districts. Taking into consideration the central position of the Hamlet, entirely surrounded by the dense populations of adjoining districts, these mortality rates must be accepted as most favourable. I attribute much of this satisfactory health condition to supplying the occupants of houses with printed sanitary instructions and general information upon matters relative to the public health. The inerease of 54 in the deaths from infectious diseases over the previous year was caused by an excess in the mortality from measles, scarlet fever, and diphtheria, in all the others there was a decrease ; the small number of deaths from small pox is, I trust, an indication of the extinction of the prolonged fatal epidemic which continued for upwards of two years. Diarrhoea was also much less fatal than in the previous year, doubtless, owing to the general low temperature, the principal cause of the disease being impure and tainted food, the decomposition or contamination may be slight and undetectable by ordinary observation and taste, but none the less capable of causing dangerous and fatal illness. Hence, the necessity of extreme care in food preservation, more especially in warm weather, the danger arises not so much from high temperature or the natural process of decomposition, as from food being stored in such places and in such a way as to be subjected to contamination by emanations from drains, house sinks, dust bins, water closets, flies, and the polluted air of close and crowded rooms; it is a common occurrence for various kinds of provisions to be brought for inspection on Sundays and Mondays, after undergoing the ordeal of being subjected to these atmospheric conditions during the previous few hours, although apparently fresh and sweet when purchased. Feeble vital powers from various adverse causes, also largely contribute to make children easy victims to this fatal disease, which nothing but improved dietary and sanitary surroundings can mitigate. Scarlet fever was the only disease in this class exceptionally fatal, this is the most intractable infection with which we have to combat, but even its subtle destructive power can be successfully defeated by judicious management and sanitation. Table V., showing deaths at various ages, gives the usual result with regard to the youngest; the deaths during the first year after birth 6 being more than one-fourth the total deaths, the next largest mortality being between one and five years of age, so that nearly half the total number of deaths occurred during the first quinquennial period. Under better conditions of food and sanitation a large per centage of these young lives would have been preserved. Reference to this Table will show the relative mortality at other periods. It is satisfactory to see the large number, more than an eighth, over 70 years of age, including both octogenarians and nonogenarians, a practical testimony to the salubrity of the Hamlet. Non-Pauper Small Pox Cases. The following numbers were admitted into the Asylums Board Hospitals from the various Metropolitan Districts during the seven months ending July, 1878. Stepney 229 Bethnal Green 69 Hackney 246 Mile End Old Town 116 St. George's-in-the-East 82 Poplar 104 Whitechapel 47 Shoreditch 45 City of London 5 Holborn 6 St. Pancras 3 Westminster 1 St. Marylcbone 1 Woolwich 1 West Ham 1 Islington 5 Barking 1 Total 964 Water Supply. A portion of the following is copied from my last year's Report, but applies almost literally to present circumstances. The supply to this Hamlet is entirely from the East London Company. Although the 7 solid and organic impurities have varied, still from the Reports of Drs. Frankland and Tidy, this Company's water has compared very favourably with the waters supplied to the metropolis by other companies. With the exception of a small section on the south side of the East Ward, the whole of the Hamlet is now supplied by constant service. This is a very great boon, not only in giving a practically unlimited supply, but by enabling the abolition, for domestic purposes, of butts and cisterns in which water became contaminated with all kinds of filth. I am of opinion, however, that for the closet supply there should be an intervening cistern between the closet waste preventer or flushing box and the main supply, otherwise I feel confident there will be danger of the water in the supply pipes and mains becoming poisoned by sewer gases, more especially if the apparatus of the box gets out of order, the communication between sewer and water supply being too direct. I believe I have traced mischief to this source. I have also seen instances in which the pipes for the domestic and closet supplies were placed at such levels, that the action of one stopped or emptied the pipe supplying the other, so that the water in the pipe supplying the closet was drawn off through the tap supplying the house; defective valves would also ensure the water being charged with sewer gases. The system of water cisterns placed over water closets still extensively prevails, and should be forthwith abolished, or an entirely separate cistern should be provided for domestic purposes; in the numerous cases where one only is used for both domestic and closet purposes, a direct communication is established between the water cistern and sewer, and the water becomes, more or less, impregnated with sewer gases; for this reason I have for years past advised the Vestry not to enforce, under the intermittent supply system, a supply of water to the closets where only one cistern would be provided, but rather trust to flushing their closets, which I am informed they do satisfactorily. An unlimited and cheap water supply would be of the greatest aid to the physical, moral and sanitary improvement of the people. With such supply accessible, they would begin to learn the value and benefit of its more frequent and plentiful application and general use, both to themselves and their surroundings. As to its potable qualities we must at present rely, to a great extent, upon the goodwill and energy of the various companies supplying the metropolis. The East London Company appear to be doing their utmost to deliver to their consumers as pure a supply as possible. Four new 8 filter beds are being constructed at Lea Bridge, and the old ones are being re-constructed. A pair of powerful engines will shortly be in operation, to give a better supply to the higher parts of their District. The Tables. These are compiled from the Returns supplied by the District Registrars, and although this entails much trouble and occupies much time, I consider they are most valuable as guides to the study of vital statistics, and a general indication of the progress made in the promotion of the Public Health—this progress is indisputable. To satisfactorily prove this we have only to contemplate what would have been the probable relative mortality of this metropolis, with its enormously increased population and density thereof, had it not been for the sanitary measures, however incomplete, adopted within the present generation.

The slaughter and cow houses in the Hamlet have also been frequently visited during the year. HENRY LESHAW, Sanitary Inspector. Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868. I have reported under the provisions of this Act upon two occasions during the year, viz.: 9 houses in Upper York Place, 1 in Harford Street, and 1 in Ben Jonson Road. It appears to operate very well in this District and equitably to all parties. Since the Act was passed I have availed myself of its powers in behalf of the Vestry and the interests of the public health in a great many instances. In no case has there been any great difficulty, and the works recommended by your Surveyor have been executed to his satisfaction. New Dwellings. Eighty new dwellings were added to the Hamlet during the year, representing [so much loss of air, space, light, and recreation ground. Let us, however, hope they will relieve the increasing human congestion in other parts of the District, but the greater probability is that they will be, as usual, occupied by immigrants from other parts of the adjoining districts. I have to thank the Vestry, and especially the Sanitary Committee, for their co-operation and support in enabling me to discharge the duties of my office with greater advantage to the public health and general sanitary condition of the Hamlet. Reference to the Sanitary Inspector's Report will show there has been an increase of work in his immediate department, and which must necessarily continue as the population increases, as will also the work of the Sanitary Committee.

The Vestry feel that, in presenting their Annual Report for the year 1879-80, they cannot do better than follow the practice of former years, and commence it by giving a comparative statement shewing the number of meetings and attendances of members thereat during the past year and the preceding three years. Meetings. The result is as follows:— MEETINGS. YEARS. 1876—7. 1877—8. 1878-9. 1879—80. Vestry 23 22 20 25 Standing Committees 76 90 89 93 Special ,, 21 48 57 28 Totals 120 160 166 146 Largest attendance at any Vestry Meeting. 83 73 69 71 Smallest ,, 43 46 35 29 Average attendance 59.2 58 54.6 49.6 The Special Committee, called the "Horse Hire, &c., Committee," appointed a sub-Committee to attend at the stables and give personal inspection of the horses, stock, &c., and that subCommittee has met weekly throughout the year, but such meetings are not included in the above statement. Other Committees have also, from time to time, appointed sub-Committees to investigate the details of matters, but such meetings and the attendances thereat have also been excluded from the Table. The diminution in the number of meetings is owing to there having been fewer meetings of Special Committees. The number of meetings of the Vestry and of the Standing Committees have increased, so that it may be taken that the ordinary business of the Vestry has required and received more attention, 8 Bills before Parliament. During the year the Parliamentary Committee considered and reported upon the undermentioned bills, and the Vestry came to the resolutions with respect to such bills, which are set out in the column opposite the name of the bill:— No. NAME OF BILL. NATURE OF RESOLUTION. 1 Disqualification by medical relief No opposition. 2 District Auditors Ditto 3 County Boards Petition to amend. 4 Artizans' Dwellings, &c Petition against. 5 Inhabited House Duty Petition in favor. 6 Metropolitan & Metrop. Dis. Rlwy. Ditto 7 Parliamentary Franchise No opposition. 8 Rivers Conservancy Petition against. 9 Metropolitan Bd. (water expenses). No opposition. 10 School Board (duration of Loans). Ditto 11 Public Works Loans (No. 2) Petition against. 12 Valuation Met. Act, 1869, amendmt. Ditto Whitechapel Hay Market. With regard to the Whitechapel Hay Market, the Vestry are pleased to be able to record that the regulations made by the Trustees, which were referred to in the Vestry's last Report, have been efficiently carried out; and the Committee of your Board and the delegates from adjoining Boards, at a meeting held in the Vestry Hall, were unanimously of opinion that matters should be allowed to rest as they are, for the present, at all events. Trafalgar square. The action against the Vestry, in relation to Trafalgar Square, came on for trial before the Vice-Chancellor, Sir R. Malins, in November last. Mr. Glass, Q.C., Mr. J Chester, and Mr. Reid, appeared for the plaintiffs, and Mr. J. Pearson, Q.C,, Mr. F. W. E. Everitt, and Mr, G. Pitt-Lewis, for the Vestry, Mr. W. Nicholson was the only witness called on the plaintiffs' part, but there were 18 witnesses on the part of the Vestry. The Vice-Chancellor having expressed an opinion that it was clear that the space outside the small circular enclosure, which formerly stood in the square, had been open and dedicated to the public. Of the Vestry's witnesses only Messrs. Pollard, Moody, F. J. Wood and Leatherdale were called, as the evidence of the others was to prove that fact. 9 After two day's hearing, the Vice-Chancellor, notwithstanding his opinion as above stated gave judgment for the plaintiffs with costs. The Vestry particularly desire to draw attention to the following extract from the judgment of the Vice-Chancellor. The Vice-Chancellor says:— "Now, considering that the square had become (although I have no doubt the property in the soil remained the property of the plaintiffs) so much public property and had become so much devoted to the houses around the square, I think any inhabitant might have prevented Mr. W. Nicholson from building on the square as he proposed. I am very distinctly of opinion that the proposal to build was one which he could not carry out, and being wrong in the proposal to build, that proposal has, very unfortunately, led to this litigation. "If the Vestry, as the protectors of the district, thought it was wrong (as I think they were entitled to think), there was a very plain remedy open to them, namely, that if he proposed to build, they could apply to any branch of the High Court of Justice, although, no doubt, the Chancery Division would be the best division for an injunction to prevent his doing so. I cannot entertain any doubt that if any branch of the Court had been applied to it would have granted an injunction to prevent Mr. Nicholson, or any one on his behalf, from building the street as he proposed. * * * * If the plaintiffs had intended to put buildings there I do not wonder at the Vestry objecting (it was their duty to object), but the precise way in which they proceeded to object does surprise me, because I am clearly of opinion that that was wrong." The Vestry had been most carefully advised before-hand by Counsel as to the mode of proceeding, and Counsel are still of opinion that the course adopted was the right one. From the extract from the Vice-Chancellor's judgment, abovequoted, the Vestry feel that they are fully shewn to have been right in their contention, that the part outside the circular enclosure had been dedicated to the public, and formed part of the highway, and that Mr. Nicholson had no right to build. The Vestry resolved itself into a Committee of the whole Board to consider the judgment of the Vice-Chancellor and Counsel's opinion thereon, and after carefully considering the whole matter, determined to adopt the advice of Counsel, and appeal against the judgment, and the appeal has accordingly been lodged and awaits hearing. Trafalgar square. 10 Dusting and Slopping. If the Vestry can succeed in getting the square kept as an open space, they feel that their great aim has been accomplished. In their previous Report the Vestry expressed a hope that they should be able, at the expiration of twelve months from the time at which they took over the work of dusting and slopping in the Hamlet, to shew that not only was the work more efficiently performed but that it had been done at less cost than formerly. The Vestry are pleased to be able to report that their hopes were verified, as appears by the report of the Committee having charge of the matter, which is printed at the end of this Report, and to which the Vestry beg to draw particular attention. Oxford Street and Diamond Bow Improvement In order to complete the Oxford Street improvement, the Vestry found it requisite to obtain a small piece of land belonging to Bottomley's Trustees, but this was done by agreement, and the whole improvement has now been effected. The Vestry disposed of the surplus land by auction, and it realized very high prices, and the result was that the net cost of the improvement (excepting a small amount of costs which will be hereafter incurred on the re-investment of certain monies paid into the Chancery Division) was £3,209 19s. 3d. The net cost of the Diamond Row improvement was £868 17s. 8d. The total expenditure for both improvements, therefore, has been £4078 16s. 11d. The Metropolitan Board of Works will contribute £1687 10s. towards the cost, which will leave a sum of £2391 6s. 11d. to be borne by the Vestry. This is a small cost for so unquestionable improvements. Paving New Streets and Foot ways. During the year the Vestry have resolved to pave the following new streets, at the expense of the. owners of property therein:— Ewing-street. Rowsell-street. Forester-street. Cantrell-road. Most of the property is small, and many of the owners are also the occupiers of the property, and have mortgaged it to Building Societies, and they find it difficult to pay, but by showing leniency the Vestry have no doubt they will ultimately succeed in getting in all the amounts. Widening Footway Paving Mile End Boad. The Vestry have, during the year, widened and re-paved the footway on the north-side of the Mile End Road, from the western end, as far as Eagle Passage. 11 The Vestry also directed a return to be made of the roadways in the Hamlet which require paving and channelling, and in which crossings ought to be put down. The Highways Committee have made several reports on the subject. In the last one submitted, the Committee divided each of the works into three classes, namely, Class 1, those requiring to be executed forthwith; Class 2, those which will require execution as soon as Class 1 have been finished; and Class 3, those which will ultimately have to be done. The Paving and Channelling. estimated costs of the various works was as follows:— WORKS. CLASS 1. CLASS 2. CLASS 3. .£ £ £ Roadway paving. 22086 19257 18080 Channels 838 2301 6836 Crossings 522 550 670 Footway paving 859 0 0 Totals £4305 £22108 £25586 In view of this report, it cannot be anticipated that the expenditure of the Vestry can be much reduced. The premises, No. 1, Ben Jonson Road, have again been reported upon, under the Artizans' and Laborers' Dwellings Act, 1868, but the Vestry hope, from the communications made to them, that the premises will now be so amended as not to cause further trouble. Artizans' and Labourers Dwellings Act, 1808. Nos. 1 to 9, Upper York Place, and 100, Harford Street, were also reported under the same Act, but the necessary works will be carried out in all probability. The following streets in the Hamlet have been re-named and re-numbered under the powers of the Metropolis Management Acts, namely:— Re-naming and Re numbering Streets. Daniel's-row Little Union Row} Re-named Daniel s-row. Ernest-street West Ernest-street Ernest-street East „ Ernest street. Gloucester-street ,, Settles-street.

The following streets have been re-numbered only under the like powers :— Emmott-street. Raven-row. Mountford-street. Lady Lake's-grove. Alderney-road. Wellesley-street. Increase of Bates. The Vestry are sorry to have to report a further increase of the rates, notwithstanding rigid economy on their part. The poor rate during the year has been equal to 2s. 3d. in the pound, as against 2s. 3d. in 1879 and 2s. 5d. in 1878. The aggregate amount of the General, Lighting, and Sewers Rates, shews an increase of 2d. in the pound over that of last year. The General Rate has been equal to is. 10½ in the £. „ Lighting ., 3½ „ Sewer „ „ 2 „ 2s. 4d. in the £. As frequently before pointed out, the amount of the School Board Precept has to be collected in the General Rate, and, as will be seen by a comparison of the amount required by the School Board this year with that of last, the increase will account for one penny in the pound of the increased General Rate. The sum of £1,845 9s. 8d., the cost of re-paving the footpath on the north side of the Mile End Road, and re-laying the old paving taken therefrom, was paid for out of the current rates, and had this not been done the General Rate would have been lower than during the previous years. The increase in the Sewer Rate was owing to the facts, (1) that there was deficiency on the sewers account to commence with; (2) that the Vestry carried out their intention of re-constructing the Oxford Street and Richardson Street sewer, at a cost of £488. Upon a careful analysis, it will be found that the Vestry's own expenditure continues to be much the same as heretofore, as if the 7d. in the pound, which may be taken as representing the sum paid for School Board Precepts be deducted from the aggregate 2s. 4d. in the pound, the residue will represent 1s. 9d. in the pound. 13 The following is a comparative statement on this point:— In 1875 the expenditure was equal to 1s. 8d. in the £. 1876 „ „ 1s. 8d. „ 1877 „ „ 1s. 8d. 1878 „ „ 1s. 8½d. d 1879 „ „ 1s. 8d. „ 1880 „ „ 1s. 9d. „ Increase of Rates. For convenience sake, the Vestry beg to again give a list of the Precepts issued to the Vestry by the School Board for London:— £ s. d. In 1871 536 17 3 1872 1001 8 10 1873 827 17 2 1874 1989 3 10 1875 3496 6 11 1876 5335 17 3 1877 6468 17 10 1878 6486 12 2 1879 7031 1 2 1880 8146 16 8 The Precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works, since 1876, have been as under:— £ s. d. 1876 6091 1 9 1877 5986 1 8 1878 6166 9 0 1879 7509 1 4 1880 8303 9 6 From the foregoing Tables it will be seen that the School Board Precept for this year shews an increase of £1115 15s. 6d. and the Metropolitan Board of Works an increase of £794 8s. 2d. over those of last year. To meet the expenses of the two street improvements, the Vestry borrowed a sum of £2,000 from the Metropolitan Board of Works, at interest at £315s. per cent., the repayment being spread over a period of twenty years. Loans Whilst on the subject of finance, the Vestry feel that they must draw attention to a subject which is receiving their careful attention, but which, they fear, must in the end cause some considerable expenditure, viz., the question of hospital accommodation for persons of the non-pauper class. Under legislation, existing prior to the Act 42 and 43 Vic., cap. 54, the Vestry is empowered to provide this, or to Hospital Accommodation. 14 combine with other parishes in doing so; and, under the Ac mentioned, the Metropolitan Asylums Board, with approbation of the Local Government Board, are empowered to agree with the Vestries and District Boards of London to receive such patients, and the Vestry can recover the expenses. Having gone carefully into the matter the Vestry came to the conclusion that it would be more beneficial to the Hamlet to combine with the neighbouring parishes in having a separate hospital of their own rather than to adopt the provisions of the above-mentioned Act, for past experience of the mode of conducting business by the Metropolitan Asylums Board does not at all betoken economical arrangements. The Metropolitan Asylums Board have accordingly been informed that the Vestry do not intend to adopt the provisions of the Act mentioned. To meet any cases of infectious diseases which may arise from time to time, until some definite plan is fixed on, the Vestry has empowered their medical officer to send any cases which may occur to the Highgate Small Pox Hospital or the Islington Fever Hospital, as the case may be. The Board of Works for the Poplar District have built a hospital for the class of persons named, at Plaistow, and the Vestry are in negociation with them with reference to a joint ownership thereof, or some other arrangement whereby the hospital may become available for the non-pauper persons of this Hamlet suffering from infectious diseases. The Great Eastern Railway Company having given notice to the Vestry that they intended proceeding with the widening of their line over Grove Road, the Vestry, pursuant to the Great Eastern Railway Act, 1876, gave notice that they would contribute £500 towards the cost of altering the Grove Road Bridge, as provided by that Act. The Vestry of Bethnal Green passed a similar resolution, and the Company will now have to reconstruct the bridge so as to give a headway of fifteen feet and to have one span of forty feet. This will be a very great advantage to the public, as the present bridge is so low that it is a source of danger to any one passing under it on the top of a tramway car or vehicle of a similar height. The two Vestries have applied to the Metropolitan Board to contribute half the cost, as the improvement will be for the benefit of the metropolis, or, at all events, to the whole of the east end of London, and there is little doubt but that that Board will contribute as desired. Grove Road RailwayBridge 15 Considerable difficulty has been experienced of late years with regard to the expenses connected with the annual election of Vestrymen and Auditors. The Vestry had, of late years, paid the amounts and made an order upon the Overseers to repay the amount to the Vestry's Treasurer. The Government Auditor declined to pass the amounts in the Overseers' accounts, on the ground that the Vestry had no power to make such an order. The Vestry, however, again made the order, and the Overseers resisted payment. The mode of enforcing payment was carefully considered by two Committees, and it was determined to apply to a magistrate for a distress warrant. This was done, and the magistrate decided that the order was invalid. The Vestry will, therefore, in the future not pay any of the accounts, but will make an order upon the Overseers to pay them. Mr. Jones, the representative of the Vestry, at the Metropolitan Board of Works, was compelled, in consequence of his engagements, to relinquish his seat, and Mr. Theodore Moore was elected in his stead. Member of Metropolitan Board of Works. In consequence of appearances in the ceiling of the Vestry Hall, it was deemed expedient to have the same thoroughly surveyed, and upon this being done, it was found that many of the timbers were in a bad state, and accordingly temporary measures have been taken to prevent any accident, but at a convenient time it will be requisite to have a new ceiling put in. Vestry Hall Ceiling. More detailed statements on many of the subjects before' adverted to, will be found in the appended Reports of the Officers to whose departments the same relate.

JENNINGS, C. LACEY, J. SIMKINS. The Committee having now carried out the matters referred to them consider that they cannot do otherwise than shortly recapitulate what has taken place. In the year 1877, the prices asked by the Contractors for supplying horses, carts, and drivers, and for the Removal of Dust, &c., had increased so enormously, that the Vestry deemed it advisable to consider whether the Vestry itself could not, in the interest of the ratepayers, both as regards cost and efficiency, beneficially undertake the carrying out such works. 17 The Vestry accordingly referred the subject to a Committee of twenty members, who, after most searching and careful enquiry, came to the conclusion that the Vestry could beneficially undertake the works, and accordingly so recommended the Vestry. The recommendation was adopted and the matter was referred back to the Committee to carry out. One of the first necessities was, in the opinion of the Committee, to secure water-side premises; and, after searching in various places, the wharf known as Riga Wharf, Emmott Street, was considered to be, from its situation, the most appropriate for the purposes required ; and the Vestry, on the recommendation of the Committee, accordingly bought the underlease thereof. The Committee then had the necessary plans prepared for erecting upon that wharf the necessary stabling and otherwise adapting it for the purposes required, and had procured the necessary licenses for the purpose, when the executors of Mr. Knight, of whom the Vestry rented a wharf also in Emmott Street, gave notice to the Vestry to determine the tenancy of the last mentioned wharf. This rendered it imperative on the Committee to make other arrangements, as it was considered essential for the purposes of the Vestry, to have a wharf, at which stone could be landed and stored, and it was found that Riga Wharf was not sufficiently large to be used as stabling as well. The Committee accordingly searched for other premises for stables, and were fortunate in being able to secure some in Canal Road, which they recommended the Vestry to take on lease, and the Vestry accordingly did so, These premises were, with comparatively small alterations, remarkably well adapted for the purposes required, and, like the wharf, are well situate in the centre of the Hamlet. Having secured the necessary wharf and stables, the Committee then turned their attention to the purchase of the necessary horses and plant, and having done so, entered upon the execution of the works at Michaelmas, 1878, To cover the outlay, the Vestry borrowed from the Star Life Office the sum of £6,000, repayable by instalments of £1,000 per annum, with interest at 4½ per cent. The details and cost of everything done by the Committee, have, from time to time, been fully reported to and adopted and approved by the Vestry, and the Committee have therefore not deemed it necessary to give more than the foregoing general statement as to matters occurring prior to Michaelmas, 1878. Having started working at Michaelmas, 1878, and a year having elapsed, your Committee determined to report to the Vestry the result of the year's working to Michaelmas, 1879, and to compare it with the cost of the previous year, when the carting of street refuse and other materials was done by horses hired under contract, but drivgn by men (mostly) in the employ of the Vestry, and when the dusting was executed entirely by men employed by, and plant, belonging to the contractor. Your Committee accordingly instructed your Surveyor to get out particulars to enable your Committee to prepare such report, which he accordingly did, and your Committee moreover appointed a sub-Committee, who went into the various items, and revised the particulars submitted by the Surveyor, and made a most minute report to your Committee thereon, and your Committee therefore beg to report as follows:— 18 During the year the sum of £1,000 off the principal, and a sum of £270 for the interest, making together £1,270, has been paid to the Star Life Office, in respect to the said loan of £6,000. The Committee consider that the Vestry, having elected to pay the loan in six years, are putting so much money into their capital each year beyond what should be taken for depreciation. The sum expended on account of the purchase of horses, fittings, and utensils for stables, harness, &c., was £2,645 7s. 9d. Depreciation thereon at eight per annum, on the assumption that the whole will last 12½ years £191 12 0 The sum expended in alterations and other permanent works to stables, providing machinery, &c., was £1,267 16s. 7d. Depreciation thereon at five per cent, per annum 63 7 9 Interest for one year on £3,913 4s. 4d., being the amount expended as above out of the sum of £6,000 borrowed of the Star Life Office, at per cent, per annum 176 1 11 Amount expended during the year for fodder, rent, rates, wages, tools, and salary of Superintendent 2,035 8 6 Gross total, cost of horses, keep, &c £2,466 10 2 Creditor by— Rent received £50 0 0 Sale of dung 15 18 6 65 18 6 Which leaves the net total amount as the expenses of the horses, &c £2,400 11 8 The horses belonging to the Vestry have worked equal to— One horse 3,340 days for slopping. 2,484 ,, dusting. 536 ,, watering. 553 ,, drawing materials. Total 6,913 days. From the figures before given it will be seen that the cost of keeping the horses, &c., has been £2,400 11s. 8d., which is equal to 6s. 11¼d. per day per horse. The cost of slopping for the year has been— Keep of horses, 3,340 days £1,123 17 6 Hire of horses and drivers 206 11 0 Wages of drivers of the Vestry's horses, fillers of carts, &c 1,139 13 2 £2,470 1 8 19 The cost for the year ending March 25th, 1878, was £1,892 7s. 5c!. The cost of dusting for the year has been— Keep of horses, 2,484 days £861 12 9 Wages of dustmen 495 12 10 Hire of horses 10 3 0 £1,367 8 7 By sale of dust 330 17 0 £1,036 11 7 The cost of dusting for the year 1878, was £1,600. The cost of watering has been— Keep of horses, 536 days £185 18 6 Wages of drivers 109 4 4 Hire of horses 44 9 0 £339 11 10 The cost of watering for the said year ending 1878, was £728 19s. 9d. The cost of drawing materials has been— Keep of horses, 553 days £191 16 6 Wages of drivers 10 12 0 Hire of horses and drivers 192 4 4 £494 12 10 The cost of the like work for the said year ending 1878, was £523 13s. 7d. From the foregoing figures it will be seen that the cost of slopping has considerably increased, whilst that of watering has decreased; this was due to the wet season. The quantity of material removed from the roads during the year 1878, was 10,121 loads, and cost 3s. 8fd. per load. In 1879, the quantity removed was 12,420 loads, and cost 3s. 11¾d. per load. There have been collected from the Hamlet 10,833 loads of dust, the cost of collection being 2s. 6£d. per load. The dust has realised 8d. per load. Your Committee find that the cost of disposing of the refuse, as compared with former years, has been as under:— 1877. 1878. 1879. G. E. R £119 5 3 G. E. R £233 5 5 G. E.

REPORT & ACCOUNTS OF THE SURVYOR TO THE VESTRY, FOR THE Year ending March the 26th, 1880. REPORT. Gentlemen, I beg again to lay before you a statement of the various works executed under the direction of my department. No road paving has been laid during the year, but I have prepared estimates and submitted them to the Highway Committee for executing a large amount of work under this head. The paving of the carriageways of the two main roads remains in a good condition with the exception of the north side of the Commercial Road, at the western end; this should be repaved with new stone, as it is in a dangerous state. I have recently recommended the Highway Committee to pave the channels of Bancroft Road with pitchers made from the scoriae arising from the iron furnaces. I think it likely that this material will prove very suitable for paving channels. In the present days of road rolling it is very desirable that the channels of all macadamised roads should be paved. UNPAVED CARRIAGEWAYS. The following list will show the quantity of material used upon each thoroughfare in the Hamlet, for the year ending March 25th, 1880. Gravel. Yards. Granite. Yards. Gravel.

Seventy-nine houses have been connected with the sewers during the year. The cost of cleansing the principal sewers of the Hamlet was ^448 18s. Two hundred and five cubic yards of soil were removed from them. The Metropolitan Board of Works have obtained Parliamentary powers to construct a storm outlet sewer to relieve the District drained by the Ratcliff Highway sewer, north-eastern branch. This sewer will only act at times of storm. The Board's engineer is now preparing the plans, and I expect the works will be commenced in the spring of next year.
