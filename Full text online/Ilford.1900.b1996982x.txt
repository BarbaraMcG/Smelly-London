I-Leek ILF 045 6554 ILFORD URBAN COUNCIL. ANNUAL OF THE Medical Officer of health AND THE Inspector of Nuisances FOR THE YEAR 1900. Ilford: wilson and whItworth ltd., high street. f \ 1 ILF 045 ILFORD URBAN COUNCIL. Medical Officer's Annual Report. To the ILFORD URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, In presenting my report on the Sanitary Condition and Health of the Urban District of Ilford during the year 1900, I beg to say that I estimate the population of the whole district, including Clay bury Asylum and Dr. Barnardo's Village Homes, at 43,701. The population of Claybury Asylum is 2,770, and that of Dr. Barnardo's Village Homes at 1,000; to this I add the population estimated for the year 1899, which is 35,069, and the increase of births over deaths is 651, and also the increase of the population by the number of new houses that have been put on the rate-book during the last year, 1,090, 300 of which are unoccupied, leaving 790 occupied, and assuming that there are about live people in a house, this source would add 3,950 to the population, these added together make 43,701; deducting the numbers in Claybury Asylum and Dr. Barnardo's Village Homes, which are 3,770, leaving the population for Ilford itself 39,931, or an increase for the middle of the year 1900, 4,870. 2 The acreage of the district is 8,493 acres, making the average number of persons on each acre 5.14. The total number of deaths from all causes which occurred in the whole district during the year is 655, 226 of which were at the Claybury Asylum, 5 were at Dr. Barnado's Village Homes, 13 at the Isolation Hospital, 25 at the Romford Workhouse, making 269. This number deducted from the number of deaths leaves 386 deaths in Ilford itself, or at the rate of 9.63 per 1,000 per annum of the population. The number of births during the year was 1,037, 147 of which died under the age of one year, or at the rate of 142.72 per 1,000 of the births. The number of infectious diseases notified during the year was 633, viz.:— Small Pox 12 Cholera 1 Diphtheria 70 Membranous Croup 1 Erysipelas 59 Scarlet Fever 190 Enteric Fever 22 Continued Fever 1 Puerperal Fever 1 Measles 326 683 Of these 662 were in Ilford itself, 17 at Claybury Asylum, 4 at Dr. Barnardo's Village Homes. 3 The number of cases removed to Hospital from each locality was—Ilford 107, Dr. Barnardo's 1, Claybury 0, outside districts 56; the outside districts are Romford Urban, Romford Rural, and Barking Urban, making a total of 164. The notification of infectious diseases seems to be very large when compared with the notifications of many other districts, but this arises from the fact that measles is a notifiable disease in the Urban District of Ilford, the notifications of which amounted to 326, which would leave 357 for other causes. I sent a report to the Local Government Board, County Council, and Ilford Urban District Council on the outbreak of small pox in March, 1900, and gave a description of how it was brought about. When it is considered the fearful rapidity with which the same disease spread in Gloucester, and Edinburgh, and now in Glasgow, where in one day there are more fresh cases notified than occurred during the whole time in Ilford, and the almost hourly contact with which the population here have, from most of our inhabitants having to travel to London every day, it must be apparent to every one that had it not been for the exceeding care with which the most prompt and urgent measures were taken to prevent the spread of the disease, the case of small pox, instead of being only twelve, would have been much greater. The Hospital for Infectious Diseases is situated in the district of Ilford, and is built to hold 20 beds, which has proved to be quite insufficient for the number of cases which the greatly increased population since it was built now require. It is the intention of the District Council to have the Hospital enlarged so as to be better able to meet the requirements of the distriot. 4 The physical features of the district of Ilford is exceeding flat in character, and almost on a level with the Thames. The sub-soil is principally gravel with occasional beds of clay in some parts of it. The house accommodation for the working classes has much improved since my last report, ns there are now good substantial rows and terraces suited in size and rent for the working man, most of these have small gardens back and front which are amply sufficient for air space. The supervision over the erection of new houses is done by the Surveyor and his staff. In connection with this I should like to mention that I disapprove of the construction of house in the matter of the bath and water-closet and washstand which are in the same compartment together; and that in some cases the water cistern which supplies the people of the house for drinking purposes and the flushing cistern for the w.c. are in the same compartment. I consider this a very inconvenient arrangement, if not a very insanitary one, in houses there are moderately large families. Bennett's Castle Lane ditch has been set in proper order and the sewerage and drainage in the greater part of Ilford is sufficient, but there are some out-lying districts, viz.:—the Eastern end of Green Lane and Goodmayes Cottages which require better drainage as they at present run into ditches through cesspools; Little Heath and Padnal's corner also require better drainage. The condition of sewers and house drains are generally satisfactory. The disposal of excrement is principally conveyed by the sewers to the Sewerage Works at Loxford, near Barking. On account of the great increase in the population are becoming insufficient for dealing with the amount of sewage 5 they are now required to deal with, but the District Council are making preparations for the enlargement of the works. In the district where there are cesspools and tub closets the contents are emptied on the land. The removal of house refuse is done by contract and is disposed of in brickfields, the removal in the Urban part of the district is weekly, and the out-l\ ing districts fortnightly. The water supply of the district comes from the South Essex Water Works and the East London Water Works, and during the year there has been a sufficiency, and I consider it to be free from pollution. Lodging-houses, slaughter-houses, bake-houses, dairies, cow-sheds, milk-shops, factories, and work-shops are all in a satisfactory condition. There are no offensive trades. Notices are served for the abatement of Nuisances. There are only a very few unabated, this is caused at the present time by several matters standing over for the consideration of the Council as to their liability respecting certain drainage works at Chadwell. The method of dealing with infectious diseases are— removal to the Isolation Hospital where possible, disinfection of rooms, and where patients cannot be taken into the hospital and have to be kept at home they are isolated from the rest of the family as much as possible, and the house subsequently disinfected. Systematic inspections have been made in the district, several houses have been put in repair, some closed, and some demolished. 6 The National Schools at Barkingside, were closed on the 22nd March, owing to an outbreak of scarlet fever; and a School at the Bee Hive was closed on November 3rd, and not opened again until after the Christmas holidays, on account of many of the Children having whooping cough and some having scarlet fever. The infectious diseases notified have been equally spread over the district during the year excepting in the two cases where the schools had to be closed. I sent a report of the summer diarrhoea to the Local Government Board, the Essex County Council, and the Ilford Urban District Council. I remain, Gentlemen, Tour obedient servant, JAMES SHIMELD, Medical Officer of Health. 7 TABLE I. For Whole of the Ilford Urban District. Year Population estimated to Middle of each Year. Births.

To the Chairman and Members of the Ilford Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in placing before you a short report of the work carried out in the Sanitary Department during the year ending 31st December, 1900. 1.—Since my last report, the long-standing insanitary condition of the cottages in Bennett's Castle Lane has been removed. They are now efficiently drained; the w.c.'s provided with flushing cisterns; and the yards paved and drained. NUISANCES. 2.—The large number of nuisances remaining unabated is accounted for by the notices having been served late in the year, and also through non-compliance of notices respecting 60 cottages, over which there was a difference of opinion between the Owners and the Council as to the liability respecting certain drainage. 12 COMPLAINTS. 3.—The complaints received were principally as to choked drain!, &c. These were given immediate attention, and the nuisances abated. OVERCROWDING. 4.—Several cases of alleged overcrowding were inquired into, but only one was substantiated. Notice was served in this case, and the overcrowding abated. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 5.—All the cases of infectious disease were inquired into, and the houses thoroughly inspected for the detection of sanitary defects. Where the patients were not removed to the Isolation Hospital, steps were taken to see that they were isolated, and the necessary precautions carried out to prevent the spread of infection. The rooms were afterwards fumigated and cleansed under my supervision. The existence of infectious disease was also notified to the Head Teachers of the different schools. GIPSIES AND TENT DWELLERS. 6.—A great amount of trouble and annoyance has again been caused by Gipsies and Tent Dwellers, and upon several occasions I have had to request the attendance of the police to assist me in their removal, and I beg to tender the Inspector my thanks for the assistance rendered. The only way to minimize the annoyance caused by these people is, by the Council enforcing their powers under the Ilford Improvement Act, and make all owners of building land efficiently fence in same, it being generally on such land near (he Town that the gipsies congregate. 13 REMOVAL OF HOUSE REFUSE 7.—The removal of House Refuse has been carried out fairly satisfactorily. Most of the complaints of non-removal were investigated, but many of them were not substantiated, the occupants of the houses having been out when the contractor's men called. The most serious cause of complaint appeared to be the uncertainty as to the day the men would call, it being Monday say in one week, and perhaps Tuesday or Wednesday in the next week. It would be very desirable, if the Council can see their way of doing so, to have the House Refuse removed more frequently, viz: in the Urban portion of the District at least twice a week, and in the Rural portion at least once a week. I recommend this, knowing as we do that in about 70% (seventy per cent.) of the cases, the Refuse has to be carried through the houses. To think what the accumulation of a week means, especially when gas fires are largely used for cooking, and no means exist for the disposal of vegetable and animal waste matters, causes one to feel disgusted with the present arrangement. DISPOSAL OF HOUSE REFUSE. 8.—Many complaints were again received during the year, of the nauseous smell arising from the burning of the House refuse in certain brickfields. Not only is the nuisance caused by the disposal of the Refuse from this District, but a very large quantity is brought into the District from other places. Some very foul smelling stuff was brought in by the G.E.R. Co. I strongly urge you to take what action is possible to get this nuisance abated. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. 9.—During the year, fifty-one samples were taken under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and submitted to the Public Analyst. Of these samples seven were certified to be 14 adulterated. Summonses were taken out in these cases, with the result that the Justices convicted in six cases and imposed fines amounting to £12 17s. Od. One case was dismissed, the defence being a "warranty." Careful watch has been maintained over food exposed for sale, but only on two occasions was it found neoessary to seize any as being unfit for the food of man. DAIRIES AND MILKSHOPS. 10.—There is a falling off in the number of these owing to several small vendors having given up selling milk. Most of the existing milkshops are nicely fitted up places, and all are kept in a cleanly condition. COWSHEDS. 11.—One new cowshed was built during the year, and one closed. All of them are kept in a clean and satisfactory state, and comply with the regulations. SLAUGHTER HOUSES. 12—These are kept in a clean and wholesome condition. ' ) BAKEHOUSES. 13.—Three new bakehouses were erected during the year and one closed. One of these has a drain opening into it, and in contravention of Sec. 15 of the Factory and Workshops Act of 1883. I am taking steps to get this altered. All the bakehouses are periodically visited, and they are kept in a satisfactory condition. 15 HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES' ACT. 14.—It was not found necessary to serve more than three notices under this Act. Five cottages were closed, two voluntarily, and three by order of the Justices. Fifty-three cottages, however, were placed in habitable repair, after the attention of the Owners had been called to their condition. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. W. KING, Mem. San.
