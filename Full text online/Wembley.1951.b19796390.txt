GRUNDY, M.D., M.R.C.S., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health BOROUGH OF WEMBLEY ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the Year 1951 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Health of the Borough for 1951. This Report has been compiled in the following five chapters, four with a statistical appendix, in which the figures relating to the functions of the Public Health Department have been collected together according to the relevant services.

The population of the Borough in mid-1951 was estimated by the Registrar General to be 130,800 and whilst this is considerably below 131,369 the preliminary census figure for 1951 it probably represents the most accurate figure attainable. It is an interesting observation that the population of Wembley and Kingsbury recorded in the census of 1931 was some 65,799, an inter-census increase of 99.7%. Wembley remains the fifth largest County District in Middlesex, those greater, according to population, being Harrow, Ealing, Willesden and Hendon. 2. In 1951 there were recorded 1,492 live births, giving a birth rate of 11.41 per thousand of the estimated population. The number of deaths was 1,224 giving a crude death rate of 9.36 per thousand. When the comparability factor (1.16) is applied the standardised death rate becomes 10.86, an increase on last year's very low figure but still below the national rate of 12.5 per thousand of the population. 3. The infantile mortality rate of 22.79 failed to maintain the record low level of 1950 and although the figure is still below the national rate for England and Wales yet it demands some attention. Prematurity of birth and congenital malformation are the main causes of death in very young infants and an emergency unit is maintained at the Edgware General Hospital which can be called to the house when a premature birth occurs to give immediate and skilled attention prior to removal if necessary to hospital. 4 STATISTICAL APPENDIX A, CERTAIN VITAL STATISTICS, 1951 from figures supplied by Registrar-General.

GENERAL HEALTH SERVICES. 1. HOSPITALS. The whole of Wembley lies within the area of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board but hospitals accepting the sick are administered by two Hospital Management Committees, the Central Middlesex Group Hospital Management Committee and the Hendon Group Hospital Management Committee, the two major general hospitals being the Central Middlesex Hospital and the Edgware General Hospital. The Wembley Hospital also accepts general cases but is under the control of the Governors of Charing Cross Hospital. Maternity cases from certain parts of the borough can be admitted additionally to the Kingsbury Maternity Hospital and bookings are undertaken through the Obstetric Out-Patients' Department of the Central Middlesex Hospital. Infectious diseases are normally accepted at the Neasden Hospital or, in case of necessity, at the Hendon Isolation Hospital. Cases of mental deficiency and mental disease are catered for at Shenley and Napsbury Hospitals. Arrangements made for the admission of tuberculous patients to a variety of hospitals through the three Chest Clinics serving the area. A list of hospitals is included:— Central Middlesex Hospital, Acton Lane, N.W.10. (ELGar 5733.) Edgware General Hospital, Edgware, Middlesex. (EDGware 8181.) Wembley Hospital, Fairview Avenue, Wembley, Middlesex. (WEMbley 3136.) Kingsbury Maternity Hospital, Honeypot Lane, Kingsbury, N.W.9. (COLindale 6309.)

Only 19 cases, 6 adults and 13 school children were referred to Kensington Medicinal Baths for treatment more intensive than could be given at the Clinics or in the homes. The generalisation remains true that infestation is scarcely a Public Health problem in Wembley. The response of the mothers to the advice given through the School Health Services is most gratifying. 14 5. MORTUARY. The public mortuary which was built a good many years ago at a time when the population was under 20,000, has continued to meet the needs of the district. That this has been possible is partly due to the provision in recent years of a refrigerated chamber which has proved of inestimable benefit. Neverthless, the time cannot be too far off when a new mortuary planned on present-day standards of lay-out and equipment will have to be provided. 169 bodies were deposited in the mortuary during the year, the majority of which were on orders from the Coroner so that post mortem examinations could be made. 15 * STATISTICAL APPENDIX B.

There is little to note in this Section for the year, as the absence of any unusual infectious disease and the lack of any major outbreak of notifiable disease have not occasioned serious concern during the year. The incidence of common infections of infancy varies slightly from time to time and the figures in the statistical appendix indicate that the experience in 1951 was not unusual or in any way adverse. One outbreak of food poisoning was recorded during the year and, although only one case was officially notified, on investigation, many mild cases were discovered. Meat was obtained for a factory canteen, cooked on Friday, the 19th October, and braised, then placed in the refrigerator for use on the following Monday. Unfortunately during the week-end there was an electrical breakdown which necessitated a switch off for all current allowing the meat to remain at a much higher temperature than was intended. The consumption of this meat in a made up dish on the Monday resulted in 60 cases of food poisoning, every single person who consumed any of the affected food. The cases, fortunately, were mild with diarrhoea and abdominal pain, but the incident illustrates the importance of using prepared meat immediately after cooking and never delaying its use to some future time. 3. The supervision of contacts landing from ship or aeroplane called for routine surveillance of 40 persons regarding smallpox and Nil persons regarding typhoid fever. Constant vigilance must be given to persons arriving from infected foreign areas and this supervision must be given with discretion and understanding. 17 18 STATISTICAL APPENDIX C.

FOOD HYGIENE. No slaughtering of animals for human consumption was carried out during the year. All meat sold in local butchers' shops comes from the London Meat Markets. Special attention was given to the condition of the vans used for wholesale deliveries and in one or two instances the attention of the distributors had to be called to unsatisfactory conditions. At the same time the assistance of the Medical Officer of Health of the district where the vans collect the meat from the markets was invoked as it was felt that it would be an easier problem to check at this point. The problems of wholesale meat distribution are not easily solved; the ideal would be for all carcases to be carried in a slung position from overhead rails, but such a system would very materially reduce the carrying capacity of vans and still does not get over the problems connected with manhandling in transferring the meat from the van to the retailers' premises. 25 A steady improvement has been noticed in conditions pertaining at all classes of food premises. Many more commodities of well known brands are obtainable to-day than was the case a few years back, which have been packed at the factories where they are produced and are claimed by the manufacturers to be untouched by hand. This progress must tend to reduce the possibilities of contamination but there are a number of articles of food which up to the moment, at any rate, cannot be treated in this way. For one thing the housewife quite naturally likes to see what she is purchasing, and this applies particularly to meat, fish and bakers' confectionery. Many more sweets are wrapped than hitherto and there has been an increase in the sales of wrapped ice cream. There are four premises registered for the manufacture of ice cream, one of which uses a cold mix and the others heat treat the mixture in accordance with the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1947 and 1948. Most of the ice cream sold in the Borough is supplied by the large and well known manufacturers in the metropolitan area and is pre-packed, 171 premises are registered for the sale of ice cream. The Wembley Clean Food Association which was formed in 1950 continued its good work during the year under review and perhaps the highlight was the Clean Food Week organised by the Association and held from 29th October—3rd November. A printed bulletin entitled "Food Hygiene—Special" was widely distributed in thousands throughout the Borough. This bulletin had a number of attractive features presented in a readable form without over-elaboration. A number of film shows, a brains trust, clean food luncheons and an exhibition formed the main items of the Clean Food Week. The exhibition was unique in that the exhibits were displayed in shop windows in the principal shopping areas of the Borough. Many exhibitions of this nature are held in halls and thereby often fail to attract the public attention which is desired. The Wembley Clean Food Association's project undoubtedly was seen by thousands more people than would have visited an exhibition held in a hall. The zealous efforts put into this venture cannot be too highly praised; as with many facets of public health work there is unfortunately no " yard stick" by which appraisal of efforts of this kind can be accurately gauged; one can only speculate. 3. FOOD AND DRUGS (MILK, DAIRIES AND ARTIFICIAL CREAM) ACT, 1950; THE MILK AND DAIRIES REGULATIONS, 1949; THE MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) (RAW MILK) REGULATIONS, 1949 and 1950; THE MILK 26 (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) (PASTEURISED AND STERILISED MILK) REGULATIONS, 1949 and 1950; THE MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) (SPECIFIED AREAS) ORDER, 1951. The last mentioned Order made by the Minister of Food which affects, amongst other areas, the whole of the. County of Middlesex, came into operation on the 1st October, 1951. The effect of the Order is that all milk sold in the area must be specially designated milk, i.e., Tuberculin Tested, Accredited, Pasteurised or Sterilised Milk. Enforcement of the Order is the duty of the Food and Drugs Authority. For some time prior to the passing of the Order it has been the practice of the local dairymen to supply only milk of the above-mentioned standards, but the Order now makes it obligatory to do so. No action was found to be necessary under Regulation 20 of the Milk and Dairies Regulations (relating to disease communicable to man by consumption of milk). During 1951/141 dealers' licences to sell designated milk were issued by the Council. 4. REGISTRATION OF HAWKERS OF FOOD AND THEIR PREMISES. Section 11 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, which is an adoptive section, came into operation in the Borough on 1st September, 1951, and supersedes Section 279 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944, which had reference only to meat, fish, fruit and vegetables. The new section is wider in application and refers to all food except any substance contained in a container of such material and so closed as to exclude all risk of contamination. There are certain other exemptions such as premises used for the manufacture or sale of ice cream, or preserved food, dairies and dairymen, all of which already have to be registered under another enactment, premises licensed for the sale of excisable liquor for ' consumption on the premises, etc. All persons, other than a person keeping open shop for the sale of food, selling or offering or exposing for sale any food from or upon any cart, barrow, or other vehicle or any basket, pail, tray or other receptacle, must be registered with the local authority and the premises used for the storage of food intended for sale in the circumstances mentioned above must also be registered. The local autliority may refuse or revoke registration if they are satisfied (i) as regards a person that the public health is or is likely to be endangered by any act or default of his in relation to the quality, storage or distribution of food; or 27 (ii) as regards premises that the premises are not suitable to be used for the purpose. This section, together with the new Food Bye-laws, is proving useful in dealing with mobile canteens. 5. SLAUGHTERHOUSES. There are no slaughterhouses in use in the Borough, although one licence to operate from 1st January—31st December, 1952, was granted by the Council after very careful consideration in respect of premises which were licensed prior to the war and which had been completedy renovated and improved following war damage. 6. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN CONNECTION WITH FOOD. Legal proceedings were taken in the following instances:— Foreign matter in bread—defendants fined £5 0s. 0d. and £3 3s.. 0d costs. Unsatisfactory conditions in Mobile Canteen in contravention of Food Bye-laws — defendant fined £5 0s. 0d. and £2 2s. 0d.. costs. 7. HOUSING. I am indebted to Miss B. L. Allen, F.S.H.M., the Council's Housing Manager, for the following note on postwar housing:— In November the Council completed the 1,000th post-war permanent dwelling and the key of this flat, No. 26, Campbell Court, was handed to the new tenant by Mr. G. H. Charlton, Principal Housing Officer, Ministry of Housing and Local Government. These first 1,000 properties comprise 650 houses, 317 flats and maisonettes and 33 Aged Persons Dwellings. Owing to the rapidly increasing shortage of building sites in the Borough the future programme is almost entirely for flats. There are still approximately 6,000 families whose names are entered on the Council's waiting list for housing accommodation. Of these approximately 1,100 require three-bedroom type accommodation, the remainder can be accommodated in two-bedroom flats or Aged Persons Dwellings. About 1,100 families have made application for private builds ing licences and 349 houses have been erected under private licence in the Borough since the war, or are in the course of erection. 8. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN CONNECTION WITH HOUSING. In four cases legal proceedings were instituted against owners for failure to comply with Nuisance Abatement 28 Notices served under Section 93 of the Public Health Act, 1930, in connection with essential repairs to houses. In one case the summons was withdrawn as the work had been carried out and the Magistrates dealt with the remaining cases in the following manner:— 6 weeks' Nuisance Order made and Council awarded 10/6d. costs; 2 months' Nuisance Order made and Council awarded £1 l1s. 6d. costs; 28 days' Nuisance Order made, defendant fined £2 and Council awarded £3 3s. 0d. costs. 9. FACTORIES ACT, 1937. The types of industries in the Borough have remained materially the same for the past few years and there has been very little extension; indeed, the development of the area has reached the point that there is very little land left for industrial purposes. Details of inspections are to be found in the statistical appendix. 622 visits to outworkers' premises were made during the year but a great many of the premises which were notified on the statutory lists were found to have ceased to be used for homework. 10. INDUSTRIAL NUISANCES. Last year's report dealt in some detail with the problems arising under this heading and the results which had been achieved up to that time. Since then some further progress has been made but owing to the siting of some factories in relation to dwellinghouses and the nature of the work carried on it is difficult to see how to afford complete satisfaction to the residents in the light of present-day scientific knowledge and of the costs of applying remedies. It is interesting to record that a balancing gear which was fitted to a large four-stage horizontal compressor proved quite effective in overcoming vibration and that when the balancing gear was taken out of commission for adjustment fresh complaints were received of vibration in nearby houses; as soon as the balancing gear was reinstated the apparent vibrations ceased. In one case of noise from a wood working factory the Council sought the advice of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and. the suggestions made were passed on to the factory management. Some of the suggestions, including the sealing of gaps round windows and doors and keeping the windows and doors closed as much as possible, were acted upon, in addition to which use was made of stacks of timber to act as a baffle between the factory building and nearby houses. 29 In a metal spraying factory the remedial works have included the building of a brick baffle wall between two buildings where it was known that much noise emanated from the gap and the placing of an extractor fan and motor used in connection with the extraction system from a shot blasting process below ground level. The installation of a new wood chipping machine in a building lined with acoustic tiles which had eliminated a very serious noise nuisance and which was referred to in last year's report, brought in its train another noise problem. The conveyor to this machine was in the open air and noise was occasioned by the tipping of lorry loads of timber on to the ground near the foot of the conveyor. It is proposed, ultimately, to enclose the conveyor in a building, but as a temporary measure the Company have maintained a high stack of bagasse (one of the raw materials used in the factory) near the tipping point, which has materially reduced the noise which is audible outside the factory premises. Knowledge and investigation of many of these problems demonstrates only too well the difficulties of arriving at a satisfactory solution. Generally, the erection of new buildings presents far less difficulties when attention to acoustical problems can be given at the planning stage than in existing buildings. 11. SMOKE ABATEMENT. Ever since the days when coal was discovered as a source of heat and power the atmosphere in this country has been polluted to a serious degree with smoke and other products of combustion. The importance of clean air should be appreciated when it is realised that the daily intake of air of the average human being is approximately 480 cubic feet or 35 lbs.—that is 6 or 7 times the intake of food and drink. It is computed that 2,400,000 tons of smoke per annum from coal sources are produced in the country as a whole, and roughly half of this comes from domestic appliances. Some progress, which has admittedly been slow, is, however, being made with the problem. The truth of the matter is that there are not sufficient supplies of electricity, gas and smokeless fuels to meet all demands and there is not the freedom of choice of solid fuels as existed before the war. In the industrial field in Wembley electricity is almost universally used as a means of motive power and there are comparatively few coal hand fired boilers used for heating. The majority of the industrial undertakings use coke, or oil, or in the case of coal fired boilers mechanical stokers are installed. Generally speaking these methods of heating are more efficient in practice than manual fired coal boilers but, nevertheless, they can sometimes be a source of trouble. Reference was made in last year's report to two cases of grit emission due to coke breeze containing a large amount of "fines" being used. In 30 one case the management changed over to fuel oil and it is understood that it resulted in increased efficiency in production with a financial saving as well as overcoming the grit problem. In the other case some improvement in the fuel was obtained through the offices of the Ministry of Fuel. Gas or electricity are the principal means of domestic cooking in the Borough, but the burning of coal is still the major source of space heating. It is quite a fair assumption to suggest that if supplies of smokeless solid fuels were readily available more of this class of fuels would be used. Approved new types of domestic fire grates have made their appearance in local shops and they appear to have a ready sale. These new grates have a regulated air supply and whilst they were originally designed for burning solid smokeless fuels they will, in fact, burn any type of solid fuel, including bituminous coal, with greater efficiency. Even with bituminous coal there is less smoke: they are more economical in use if properly regulated than the older type of grate and they can be regulated to keep in all night. Public Health legislation provides machinery for dealing with nuisances arising from excessive emissions of smoke from industrial undertakings with certain qualifications but smoke from private houses is exempt from this legislation. It would appear that far greater benefits will accrue towards the elimination of smoke by reason of economic factors than by legislation. The times and the present day cost of fuels with their upward trend and the elimination of unproductive drudgery call for more efficient use of fuels; more and more coal should be carbonised, thus yielding its valuable by-products for other purposes and leaving a residue of useful smokeless fuel. It follows as a natural corollary that greater efficiency in the use of" fuels and a more ready supply of smokeless sources of heat and power will result in a far cleaner atmosphere. The Council are corporate members of the National Smoke Abatement Society whose work and publications within the limits of its financial resources are of very high national repute. A -standard grit deposit gauge has been installed in order that measurements can be taken in collaboration with an adjoining Borough. Close liaison has continued between the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department and the Public Health Department, so that the Sanitary Inspectors are able to advise upon the technicalities of smoke prevention before new fuel burning plant is installed. 31 12. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951; THE RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS REGULATIONS, 1951. This new legislation which repealed The Rag Flock Acts, 1911 and 1928, came into operation on the 1st November, 1951. The Act provides for the licensing by local authorities of premises used for the manufacturing or storing of rag flock for use on premises registered under the Act, such licence to remain in force for a period not exceeding twelve months but may be renewed from time to time for similar periods. It also provides for the registration of premises where specified filling materials are used in manufacuring bedding, toys, baby carriages and other articles of upholstery, but the following activities are excluded from the need for registration:— (a) the remaking or reconditioning of any article; or (b) any upholstering in connection with the building or making or fitting out of railway carriages, road vehicles, ships or aircraft, or upholstering of such other kinds as may be prescribed. The specified materials include rag flock, unwoven cotton, cotton linters, cotton millpuffs, cotton felt, cotton flock, unwoven wool, woollen felt, woollen flock, jute, unwoven synthetic fibres, synthetic fibre flock, hair, feathers or down, kapok, coir fibre, Algerian fibre, Mexican fibre, sisal, seaweed, seagrass, Spanish moss, straw or chaff. Standards of cleanliness to which these filling materials must conform are specified in the Regulations. Nine visits were made by Sanitary Inspectors to premises to ascertain whether registration was necessary. As a result two premises were registered by the Council and the remainder were found not to require registration either on the grounds that the activities were confined to the remaking or reconditioning of articles or that business had ceased. There are no premises in the Borough which require to be licensed. 13. WATER SUPPLY. The water supply of the Borough, which is provided by the Colne Valley Water Co., except for a small area in the southern end of the district supplied by the Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Co., remained satisfactory in quality and quantity. The supply is pumped from deep wells in the chalk outside the Borough boundaries. All of the samples taken from piped supplies were reported as satisfactory. No tendency to plumbo solvent action has been detected. All dwelling houses in the Borough are provided with a mains water supply. 32 14. SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE. For the most part the drainage of the Borough is on the separate system, the surface water going into surface water sewers which discharge into the River Brent, the Wealdstone Brook and their tributaries and the sewage going into soil sewers which are connected to the West Middlesex main drainage scheme with purification works at Mogden. Over a number of years surcharging and consequent flooding have been experienced in times of heavy rain and the Borough Engineer and Surveyor has submitted a comprehensive report to the Council setting out the remedial works necessary to give relief. The schemes will involve thousands of pounds and it would appear that some time will elapse before they can be carried into effect owing to stringency of the times. There are now only four cesspools remaining in the district and none of these receives drainage from dwelling houses; where they do exist it is due to a sewer not being available to which the premises can be connected. The Council's policy has been to get rid of cesspools as soon as main drainage has become available. All dwelling houses are provided with water closets connected to the Council's sewers. The Sanitary Inspectors are responsible for the testing of the internal soil pipes of all new Council houses and reports are forwarded to the Borough Engineer and Surveyor from time to time. 15. SWIMMING POOLS. During 1951 "break point" chlorination was instituted at the two Swimming Pools belonging to the Corporation, with the anticipated beneficial results envisaged in last year's report. Algal growth was non-existent, the water had a characteristic sparkle, and the bottom and sides of the pools were more easily maintained in a clean condition and free from deposits. Bacteriological examination of the water showed that it was up to the standard of drinking water (less than one B. Coli in 100 ml.). The attendances at the pools were:— 16. RODENT CONTROL. The Rodent Control Service, for which a 50% grant is obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, continued to operate. A free service is provided to householders in respect of treatment at private dwelling houses but in all other cases a charge is made on a time and materials basis. Three properly trained assistants are employed on this work and details of the work done are given in the statistical appendix. Kingsbury Vale Farm 106,674 97,795 33 In February and March, 1051, a 10% test bait of sewer manholes was carried out; 341 manholes were baited and there were 10 recorded "takes". In the maintenance treatment which followed 182 manholes were baited, giving 102 partial "takes" and 42 complete " takes ". The maintenance treatment carried out in August gave the following figures:—manholes baited 205; partial "takes" 134; complete "takes " 24. The number of premises found infested and .subsequently treated was approximately the same as in the previous year but none of the infestations was heavy. A commencement has been made in the use of Warfarin, a blood anti-coagulant, mixed in very small proportions with medium oatmeal as a bait and although the results are very promising it is too early to draw definite conclusions upon the experience so far gained. 17. THE HYDROGEN CYANIDE (FUMIGATION OF BUILDINGS) REGULATIONS, 1038; THE HYDROGEN CYANIDE (FUMIGATION OF BUILDINGS) REGULATIONS, 1051. The 1051 Regulations, which introduced several new features, came into operation on the 1st February, 1052, and repealed the 1038 Regulations. For several years no statutory notifications of intention to use Hydrogen Cyanide for fumigation have been received in the Department. With the advent of insecticides such as D.D.T. and Benzine Hexachloride the necessity for using such a dangerous substance as Hydrogen Cyanide has been very materially reduced and its use is only warranted in exceptional circumstances. IS. MOSQUITOES. No mosquito activity was reported during the year under review. Preventive measures which were put into operation at places which were known to be breeding sites on a previous occasion appear to have been effective against the species Culex Molestus. 34 STATISTICAL APPENDIX D.

ADMINISTRATION, STAFF. During the year your medical officers have acted professionally for the Council, performing 73 clinical medical examinations of actual or potential staff and have provided a number of special reports to the various Committees of the Council. This activity helps in the provision of a medically sound personnel for all activities of the Council and enables special consideration to be given to any unusual case of sickness, thereby maintaining a standard of efficency impossible without such a service. There have been no changes in the staff of the department during the year and I am proud to record the loyalty and diligence displayed in the routine work of the office. I take this opportunity of thanking them for another year of conscienteous effort. I would conclude by an expression of appreciation to all members of the Council, especially those who serve on the Highways, Works and Public Health Committee and particularly the Chairman for the admirable way in which they have directed the policy of the Department during the year. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, E. GRUNDY, Medical Officer of Health. 47
