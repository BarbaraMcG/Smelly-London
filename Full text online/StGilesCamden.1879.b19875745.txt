This Report, made in compliance with the requirements of the Metropolis Management Act, 18 & 19 Vic. cap. 120, comprises: Pages 1. Annual Accounts 1878-9 7 2. The Works during that Year 22 3. The Medical Officer's Report 27 4. The Analyst's Report 59 Annual Accounts. These Accounts are annexed. The Precept of the Metropolitan Board of Works for the year 1879, which comprises Main Drainage, Fire Brigade, Bridge Expenses, General Improvements, Sinking Fund, and the General Expenses of that Board, amounted to £8,166 18 7 The Precept of the School Board and the Election Expenses—£111 12 3 7,756 12 2 Making together £15.923 10 9 which sum is more than one-third of the expenditure of this Board. The following are the amounts paid by this District to the Metropolitan Board of Works for the last thirteen years:- Year. Amount. £ S. d. 1867-8 7,328 12 10 1868-9 6,297 8 5 1869-70 6,303 4 0 1870-1 6,648 13 10 1871-2 4,308 14 4 1872-3 3,244 0 10 1873-4 3,434 16 0 1874-5 5,605 13 8 1875-6 6,751 15 4 1876-7 6,893 1 2 1877-8 6,700 0 0 1878-9 6,823 6 4 1879-80 . 8,166 18 7 The precept for the year 1880 is 8,870 13 9 8 The amounts paid to the London School Board since it was constituted are as follow:- Year. Amount. £ s. d. 1871 719 11 9 1872 1,208 8 10 1873 939 15 11 1874 2,348 5 1 1875 3,953 0 2 1876 5,869 8 9 1877 7,243 1 8 1878 7,177 7 0 1879 7,644 19 11 The precept for the present year amounts to £8,698 17s. 5d. being at the rate of 6¼d. in the £. The extravagant expenditure of the London School Board still continues : it increased from 208 per cent. in 1877 to 225 per cent. in 1878, and in the present year to 270 per cent. It was understood when the Bill was passed in the House of Commons that the rate should never exceed 3d. in the £: it is now more than double that sum. Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868. The works required by the Board to certain houses in Shelton Street, mentioned in its Report for 1878-9, have been carried out, except where the premises are intended to be rebuilt by the owners, which are shut up. In the last Session of Parliament, an Act to amend the above-mentioned Statute was passed, containing (inter alia) a power enabling owners, who might by the Local Authorities be ordered to rebuild their premises, to require such authority to purchase their interests, and cast the expense of rebuilding on the Vestry or District Board in whose area the premises are situate, the funds for such purpose to be raised by rate within such area; with power to the Metropolitan Board of Works on failure by the Local Authority, to proceed to carry out the same. Seeing that the cost of the street improvements in the Metropolis and of the new dwellings for the working classes, under the Artizans' Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875, are borne by a rate imposed on the entire Metropolitan area, it is difficult to understand the principle of this legislation—both Acts being for the improvement of the dwellings of the working classes—and why, because the improvements are to be carried out by two different authorities, the burden of the same should not be borne by the entire Metropolitan area. 9 Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875. GREAT WILD STREET SCHEME. The area comprised in this scheme has been entirely denuded of the wretched habitations formerly standing thereon. The Peabody Society are, it is reported, about to commence tue erection of suitable dwellings on the site, and the other improvements directed by the scheme are about being made. LITTLE CORAM STREET SCHEME. This scheme, which is to be carried out by the Metropolitan Board of Works, has made very little progress, the south end half of Abbey Place only having been pulled down and the materials removed by the freeholder. The claims of the owners of the other parts of the area are being investigated and dealt with. The Peabody Society have agreed, when the site is cleared, to purchase the land of the Metropolitan Board of Works, and proceed speedily to erect dwellings for artizans thereon. COAL YARD AND GOLDSMITHS' ALLEY IMPROVEMENT. The purchases of the land required for this improvement have for some time been completed, and the street is about to be laid out. It has, however, been found that the entrance into Macklin Street from Goldsmiths' Alley on the west side is too sharp, and that owing to the defective condition of the flank wall of the house at that corner, it has become absolutely necessary that the same should be rebuilt at an expense of about £150; under these circumstances it has been considered that the best course to pursue is to purchase the premises, remove the building (scene painters' workshops), and after throwing a portion of the corner into the new street, to sell the remainder of the site. This plan has been adopted, and the freeholders have agreed to purchase the remaining land, at an increase on the price to be paid by the Board for the same. Water Supply. The burdensome rates imposed by the Water Companies of the Metropolis still continue. Since the last Report of this Board, the late Government brought a Bill into the House of Commons for the purchase of those companies, but as the price to be paid for their interest would have amounted to about £32,000,000, to be met by the creation of Government Stock to 10 that amount, the public opinion was very strongly opposed to it, and the Bill, owing to the dissolution of Parliament, could not be proceeded with. Under the new Ministry a Select Committee of the House of Commons has been appointed to consider the whole subject, and the Committee is now sitting. Wood Paving. The carriage-way of Great Queen Street from Drury Lane to Little Queen Street has during the present season been laid with wood, at a cost of £1,824 19s. 6d. Several applications to lay down wood paving in other streets in the District are before the Board for consideration, but owing to its large cost and short duration, they have been compelled to defer the same. The Decease and Retirement of Members. The announcement of the death of Rear-Admiral Edward Barnett, of Woburn Square, in the month of August last, was received by the Board with much regret. The deceased gentleman was, until that event, its oldest living Member, having been among the first elected on its incorporation in the year 1856, and its first representative at the Metropolitan Board of Works. He courteously and ably presided over the Meetings of this Board at intervals during the long period of 20 years. The Board regret to state the retirement of John Hodge, Esq., of Bussell Square, on his ceasing to reside in London; that gentleman was a Member of the Board for 11 years, and during that period was active and attentive to the duties of the same. Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875. Since the last Annual Report of this Board the above Act has been amended in many particulars, by enacting that in the sale of adulterated articles it should be no defence to allege a purchase for analysis (adopting the decision of the Queen's Bench Division, in the appeal case instituted by this Board, referred to in last Year's Report); increasing facilities for the purchase of milk at the place of delivery to any purchaser; imposing a penalty on refusal to sell milk for analysis; extending the Act to a sale of milk in the streets ; creating a standard for spirits; and limiting the time within which proceedings for offences should be had. The number of articles analysed during the year was 272. Proceedings were instituted in 32 cases, and convictions obtained in each case. The fines and costs imposed in such cases amounted to £56 18s. 6d. 11 The enforcement of the Act in this District has been productive of a considerable abatement of the adulteration of articles of consumption, but much difficulty has been and is experienced by the evasive conduct of dishonest tradesmen. Dr. Redwood has, with the approval of the Local Government Board, been again appointed the Analyst for this District. His Report for the year is annexed. Sanitary Acts. There have been 14 cases of proceedings before the Magistrates under these Acts, and orders obtained for the abatement of the nuisances complained of. In some cases the Board have entered on the unsanitary premises and caused the works to be performed, and recovered the costs of the same from the owners.

Granite on concrete 229 9 4 Tower Street, portion of Redressed granite on ballast 77 5 1 £6,721 2 4 The following macadamized roadways were recoated with broken granite, steam rollers being used to consolidate the granite after it was spread. Russell Square (north side, portion of west side, and south-east corner) Marchmont Street (south end) Huntley Street Bedford Place Torrington Street Bedford Square (east side) Upper Bedford Place Brunswick Square Bury Place (a horse roller was used here) Bernard Street (west end) The whole of the remaining macadamized roads in the District were repaired, and their surfaces maintained in good order. 23 Five new crossing refuges were formed, viz., two in Oxford Street, by Bloomsbury Street; one in Oxford Street, by Tottenham Court Road; one in Theobalds Road, by Kingsgate Street; and one at the west end of Theobalds Road, by Southampton Row. New Sewers. The following lengths of new Sewers were constructed during the year:— Southampton Row (from High 510ft. lineal of brick sewer, 4ft. by Holborn to Vernon Place) 2ft. 6in. internal dimensions. New Compton Street (north end) 90 do. do. Dyott Street (north end) 176 do. do. Smart's Buildings (north end) 90 do. do. Total 830 ft. lineal of new brick sewers. A length of 210 feet of old brick sewer, running beneath the houses on the east side of Cross Lane, being found to be very decayed and in a dangerous condition, was filled up and a 12 in. pipe sewer laid in its stead. Street Cleansing. The cleansing of the public carriageways was performed by a staff of 35 men employed by the Board, and consisting of 1 foreman, 3 gangers, and 31 sweepers. Two sweeping machines, each drawn by one horse, were used in sweeping the paved carriageways. The street sweepings were carted away by contract, and amounted to a total of 10,378 loads. The cost of the street cleansing for the year ending 25th March, 1880, was as follows:— £ 8. d. Wages 1,902 14 1 Brooms, scrapers, shovels, &c., and clothing for men 166 0 7 Amount paid to contractors for removing street sweepings 2,615 13 4 Total cost for street cleansing £4,684 8 0 24 The carriageways of High Holborn, Oxford Street, Little Queen Street, High Street, Hart Street, and Great and Little St. Andrew Streets, were washed on several occasions during the year, by means of watering carts and the sweeping machines. The cost of the washing is included in the two items of cost for street cleansing and street watering. Street Orderly Boys. In July last, your Surveyor reported to the Board on the desirability of employing boys, in cleansing the footways of the main thoroughfares in the District, during sloppy weather, and the utilizing the staff of boys during dry weather, in collecting the horse droppings on the wood paving in High Holborn and Oxford Street. The matter was fully considered by your Board, who resolved, on the 14th October, 1879, to employ 8 boys and 1 man (as ganger) for those purposes. These commenced work on the 3rd November, 1879, and the system has been continued to the present time, the result being highly satisfactory. Street Watering. The street watering was performed by contract, the contractor supplying all carts, horses and drivers required, at a fixed price for the whole work for the year. The water for this purpose (including that used for street washing) was 2,319,000 gallons. £ s. d. The amount paid for water-meter hire, repairs of stand posts, &c., was 183 6 10 To contractors for carts, horses and men 805 11 0 Total £988 17 10 Removal of Dust. The dust and ashes were removed from the houses in the District by contract, at a cost of £1,516 13s. 4d. Limewhiting Courts. The walls of buildings at the entrances to the mews, yards, courts, alleys, &c., in the District were twice cleansed and limewhited, at a cost of about £60. 25 Public Urinals. A new Jennings' Patent Urinal to accommodate three persons was placed in Pied Bull Yard. This was in lieu of an old urinal that had previously existed there, but which had been removed to enable a new building to be erected adjoining the site thereof. The urinal in Short's Gardens, adjoining the new Workhouse, has been taken down, its site being included in the new building. It is very desirable that a new urinal near to the site of the old one should be erected as soon as possible. The public urinals belonging to the Board are 18 in number, and contain 46 compartments; 10 of the urinals, containing 35 compartments, have water laid on to them, the others have not. The whole of them are cleansed daily by the Board's workmen List of Public Urinals in the St. Giles District. Bainbridge Street 5 compartments Water supply laid on. Chenies Mews (North) 3 do. do.

This lamp was previously lighted by 3 burners, each consuming 5 cubic feet of gas per hour, and giving a light equal to 48 candles. The work of substituting the new improved circular lamps for the old pattern square ones was proceeded with. The total number of lampposts and lanterns of the new pattern now in the District is 247. 26 The following is a list of the Contracts entered into by the Board and in force up to the 25th day of March, 1880:— Name and Address of the Contractor.

The length of the streets and roads is about 1,500 miles, and their area nearly 12 square miles. The area of London being 122 square miles is equal to a square of about 11 miles to the side. The sewers have a length of about 2,000 miles.

TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen,— I beg to lay before you my Annual Report, with the several statistical tables, for the year 1879. St. Giles District Contains a superficial area of 245 acres. Its density of population is 219 to an acre (Census 1871). The average elevation of the District above Trinity high-water mark is above 68 feet. St. George, Bloomsbury 17,843 The Population (Census 1871) St. Giles, South 19,089 ( St. Giles, North 16,497 Total 53,429 Marriages and Marriage-rate. The marriages in 1879 were 382, viz.:— Name of Building. Denomination. Number of Marriages. St. Giles-in-the-Fields (Parish Church, High Street) Established Church 122 St. George, Bloomsbury (Parish Church, Hart Street) Established Church 152 Superintendent Registrar's Office 35 Sardinian Chapel, Sardinia Street Roman Catholic. 46 Bloomsbury Chapel, Bloomsbury Street Baptist 4 Little Wild Street Chapel Baptist 7 Keppel Street Chapel Baptist 2 Great Queen Street Chapel Wesleyan Methodist 7 Eglise Suisse, Endell Street Swiss Reformed Church 5 Kingsgate Chapel, Kingsgate Street Baptist 2 Total 382 The marriage-rate was 14 2 persons married to 1,000 of the population. 31 The low marriage-rate may be ascribed to the commercial depression of the past year. The marriages in St. Giles District in the preceding four years were, 397, 390, 391 and 415; the average marriage-rate for five years being 147 per 1,000. The marriage-rate for England and Wales in 1879 was 14.4 per 1,000. Births and Birth-rate. The births registered during the year in the three Sub-Districts were as follows:— St. George, Bloomsbury 434 St. Giles, South 765 St. Giles, North 441 Entire District 1,640 of which 821 were males, and 819 females. These numbers require correction, as they do not accurately represent the birth-rate, either in the whole District or in the SubDistricts : for example, 18 births at the Workhouse were children of mothers who belonged to the Strand Union; and 127 of the children born at the British Lying-in-Hospital, Endell Street, belonged to parents residing in various other parts of London and suburbs : therefore 145 births must be deducted from the whole District, and also from one of the Sub-Districts (St. Giles, South), where they were registered. This reduces the actual number of births to 620 in St. Giles, South, and 1,495 in the whole District; and gives a birth-rate of 27"9 per 1,000. The ratio of births to population is as 1 to 35 7, which will be seen more clearly in the following table:— Showing the Birth-bate in St. Giles and its Sob-Districts in 1879, and the Eatio of Births to Population. Sub-Districts. Population. Births. Ratio of Births to Population. Rate per 1,000. Average Birth Rate per 1,000 for 10 years 1869—1878.

The natural increase of population by excess of births over deaths was 437,192. 32 In England and Wales the birth-rate was equal to 351 per 1,000, and 0.6 below the decennial average Death and Death-rate. The deaths registered in the three Sub-Districts were as follows:— St. George, Bloomsbury 276 St. Giles, South 572 St. Giles, North 271 Entire District 1,119 of which 585 were males, and 534 females. In order to obtain the accurate death-rate, a deduction must be made of 47 deaths of non-parishioners who died in the Workhouse, Broad Street; the British Lying-in-Hospital, Endell Street; and the Infants' Home, 35, Great Coram Street; and 135 deaths must be added of parishioners who died in the several public hospitals and institutions out of the District, and other corrections must also be made for the Sub-Districts, and the proper numbers apportioned to each. These corrections show the actual number of deaths at 1,207, giving a death-rate for the whole District of 22.5 per 1,000. The ratio of deaths to population is as 1 to 44.2. The average death-rate for the ten years, 1869 to 1878, was 24.52 per 1,000. The various deaths which occurred in public institutions, both in and out of the District, also the corrected death-rate, are shown more clearly by the following tables:— The Number of Deaths in St. Giles Workhouse, the British Lying-in-Hospital, and the Infants' Home, 1879.

The registered births exceeded the registered deaths during the year by 521. In the United Kingdom 707,379 deaths were registered in 1879, equal to a rate of 20 7 per 1,000. In England and Wales the death rate was equal to 210 per 1,000, and 0.8 below the average rate in the ten preceding years. Deaths of Infants. Though 1,640 children were born during the year, only 1,394 survived, 246 having died before attaining the age of one year. This is equal to a death in every 6 6 of all registered births, and 1 death in every 4.5 of all registered deaths. c 34 Deaths of Young Children. 428 children died under five years of age, which gives 1 death in every 3'8 of all registered births, and 1 death in every 2 6 of all registered deaths. The infantile mortality was high, but below the average. The greatest number of deaths were from whooping-cough, diarrhoea, syphilis, convulsions, bronchitis, lung diseases, premature birth, atrophy, and accidental suffocation. Deaths of Old People. 256 persons died at 60 years and upwards, giving the following rate of mortality:—1 death in every 4.3 of all registered deaths, and in every 208 of population. St. Giles, South, has had the largest number of deaths above 60 years of age, both in relation to total deaths and to population. This was mainly owing to the number of old persons living in the Workhouse, which is situate in that Sub-District. The Workhouse, Broad Street- 206 deaths occurred at the Workhouse during the year, of these 30 belonged to the Strand Union by previous residence. 1st quarter, ending March 25 60 2nd quarter, ending June 24 43 3rd quarter, ending September 29 38 4th quarter, ending December 25 65 Total deaths 206 In addition to these, 46 parishioners died at the Hospital of the Central Sick Asylum Board, in Cleveland Street, and 4 at the Stockwell Fever Hospital. These make a total of 256 pauper deaths. The British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street. Births.—169 poor women were delivered of children in this Hospital. 158 children were born alive, and 11 still-born. Of the living children, 70 were males and 88 females. 2 of the mothers (by previous residence) belonged to St. George, Bloomsbury; 17 to St. Giles, South; 12 to St. Giles, North ; and 127 to various other Metropolitan parishes. Deaths.—10 deaths occurred amongst the inmates, viz., 1 female adult and 9 children. The adult (a mother setat. 36) died from consumption. Of the 9 children, 3 died from premature birth, 3 35 from debility, 1 from peritonitis, 1 from blood poisoning, and 1 from disease of the lungs. The Hospital was free from puerperal fever, and the patients were, as a rule, remarkably healthy. Praise is due to Miss Freeman, Matron, for the able manner in which she manages the Institution. The Infants' Home, No, 35, Great Coram Street. The deaths of 7 children were reported from this Home, viz., 3 from syphilis, 3 from debility, and 1 from bronchitis. The Bloomsbury Dispensary, Great Russell Street. Mr. Steele, the Resident Medical Officer, has kindly furnished me with the following table of the number of cases which have been under treatment at the Bloomsbury Dispensary during the past year. This Institution renders valuable aid to the suffering sick poor in our densely populated District. I have to thank the Staff for their promptness in notifying the existence of any infectious disease amongst their patients, with a view to arrest the spread of disease.

(/« the Order of the Registrar-General's Tables.) CLASS I.— ZYMOTIC DISEASES. Orders : Miasmatic, Enthetic, and Parasitic. The death-rate in 1879 for England and Wales, from seven of the principal zymotic diseases, was equal to 2 39 per 1,000. The death-rate from these seven diseases in the four preceding years, was equal to 344, 311, 2.71, and 3'32 per 1,000. The death-rate for Inner London was equal to 3'2 per 1,000, and in the outer ring it was 1.8 per 1,000. c 2 36 The death-rate for St. Giles District was equal to 2'4 per 1,000, and considerably below the average. The total number of deaths in the three orders were 157, of which 114 were children under 5 years of age. I will now discuss these deaths under the heads of their respective diseases. Order I.— Miasmatic. Small-pox.— No deaths were recorded from this disease during the last year (decennial average 141). Ten mild cases were removed to Fulham Hospital, all of which recovered. The following annual return relative to vaccination in the District has been kindly sent to me by Mr. Yardley, the Vaccination Officer of the Guardians. Return respecting Vaccination op Children whose Births were Registered during the Year. (For the period from July 1, 1878, to June 30, 1879.)

The number is below the average (26.9). Scarlet Fever.— The District, with the rest of London, suffered from the epidemic of scarlet fever of last year. We lost 38: all children (decennial average 33.7). Diphtheria.— 4 deaths occurred from this disease (decennial average 3.4). Qcinsy.— This disease, which is so rarely fatal, caused us the death of 1 adult. Croup carried off 3 children. Whooping- Cough did not affect us so severely as in 1878, but still we lost 34 children, against 65 in the preceding year (decennial average 39'2). Fever (Typhus).— This infectious form of fever, which had been absent from the District since 1874, reappeared this year, and in its old haunts— Lincoln and Orange Courts. Dr. Ross, in his Annual Report to the Board, in 1874, said (page 41): "It wiil be in the recollection of the Board, that in my Report for 1873, I described the outbreak of typhus fever in the Great Wild Street section of this District, an outbreak that originated in Lincoln Court; for two years, therefore, this endemic has haunted this quarter. Lincoln Court has long been notorious as the nestling place of fever, and your Board has on numerous occasions insisted upon large improvements being carried out there; but it has long been obvious that no partial measures can have any avail in destroying the seeds of pestilence in that locality." The outbreak in 1879 may be divided into two distinct groups of cases:— The first case of the first group occurred on 22nd August, when the House Physician of King's College Hospital informed the Medical Officer of Health of the Strand District, that a young woman, Hannah L, set. 30, was admitted to the Hospital the previous day from Bear Yard, Lincoln's Inn Fields, in the Strand District, suffering from typhus fever. On receiving this information, the Medical Officer visited the house, and ordered the rooms to be disinfected, and ascertained that the woman had slept there about five nights before she went to the Hospital for advice, and that previous to her residence in Bear Yard she lived in Lincoln Court, Drury Lane, which is in St. Giles District. The Medical Officer of the Strand District gave me the history of the case as far as he knew it, but it was of little use to me, inasmuch as the houses in Lincoln Court, being included in the area condemned by the Metropolitan Board of Works, were cleared of their inhabitants on the 3rd August, and were demolished before the woman went to the Hospital; it was therefore impossible for her to have been resident in Lincoln Court at the time she stated, but she may have lived there before August 3rd. I was here baffled in my inquiries; and as she died, nothing further could be discovered of her history prior to her living in Bear Yard. The woman died of typhus fever. 39 The second case of this group occurred on the 26th September, when Mary F, ætat. 22, of No. 7, Orange Court, Drury Lane, was reported to be in the same Hospital from typhus fever. This young woman left her home on the 16th September, and went to Brenchley, in Kent, for hop-picking, and complaining of illness whilst there, returned to London on the 20th, and slept in other lodgings, at No. 4, Wild Court, where she remained until the 22nd, when she was admitted into the Hospital. Orange Court is very close to and parallel with Lincoln Court: they run from Drury Lane to Great Wild Street; the back yards to the houses in Lincoln Court abut on the public way, five feet wide, in front of the houses in Orange Court. The third case, on 1st October, I made inquiries in Orange Court, and found at No. 7, the very house in which Mary Flived before she went. into the country, a girl named D, agtat. 13, lying ill, under the care of the Medical Officer of the Guardians, with feverish symptoms, yet no typical signs of typhus; but being in the same house, grave suspicions arose as to the real nature of the fever. She was removed to King's College Hospital, and the case proved to be typhus. The fourth case of the group, on the same day, 1st October, a girl named E, ætat. 17, living away from her parents, was found sleeping on the stairs at No. 5, Orange Court, destitute and ill. She was removed to Hospital, suffering from fever. The fifth case occurred thirteen days after the preceding one, and at No. 6, Orange Court. Julia S was removed from this house to Stockwell Fever Hospital, and the resident medical superintendent informed me that she was suffering from typhus fever. Here were three houses, Nos. 5, 6, and 7, Orange Court, undoubtedly infected with typhus fever. On the same day, the 14th October, the sixth case occurred. Cornelius S (adult), being admitted into King's College Hospital, from No. 7, Orange Court, also suffering from typhus fever. A week after this date, the seventh case, John L, of No. 7, Orange Court, was removed by the Guardians to Stockwell Hospital, and the resident medical superintendent also certified this to be typhus fever. The second group of cases appears to have been imported into the District by hop-pickers, who had returned from Kent. Case No. 1.—Jane H, ætat. 22, was removed from No. 28, Little Earl Street, Seven Dials, by the Guardians on 20th October, suffering from typhus fever, to the Stockwell Fever Hospital, where she died a few days after admission. This poor woman's history demands some attention. She resided in Little Earl Street, and in the middle of September left with a party to go hop-picking in Kent. Her party, with numerous others, occupied a shed, and slept on loose straw. In the first week of October she returned to London, and was delivered of a child at the London Bridge Station; after which she went on to her old lodgings in Little Earl Street. 40 I have no doubt that typhus fever was in the shed where this poor woman slept at Cobham, for I am informed that a girl was there, very hot, feverish, and covered with spots. No medical aid was obtained, but a man named M, brother of Jane H, took the girl, carrying her part of the way, to Gravesend, and sent her up to London by a train. All traces of the girl appear to be lost. M, the good Samaritan, in a few days afterwards sickened, was conveyed iu a fly to Gravesend, and by train to London. He appears not to have gone to his former home, but to St Thomas's Hospital, where he died from typhus fever. Case 2 is Daniel H, the husband of Jane H. He was not with his wife hop-picking, and on his wife's removal to hospital, he changed his lodging and lived at 29, Broad Street, St. Giles, where he sickened, and was removed by the Guardians to Stockwell Hospital on on 31st October, with typhus fever. Case 3.—Annie O, ætat. 16, who formed one of the party of hop-pickers, went from No. 22, Coal Yard, Drury Lane, in a cab to Guy's Hospital, on 4th November, and was certified by the house physician to be suffering from typhus fever. Cases 4 and 5.—Mrs. D and child were removed from No. 28, Little Earl Street, on the 7th November, by the Guardians, to Stockwell Fever Hospital, suffering from typhus fever. Mrs. D had acted in the capacity of friendly lying-in nurse to Jane H. Case 6.— On 14th November, Mr. D, husband of the above patient, was removed to Stockwell Hospital, Buffering from typhus fever. Case 7.—On 20th November, another of Mrs. D's children was removed to Stockwell, suffering from typhus. Case 8.—On 21st November, Maria S, aged 9 years, was ill at home, at No. 11, Dudley Street, with typhus fever. Case 9.— Ellen H, aged 25, of 29, Broad Street, was removed to Stockwell Hospital on 21st November, suffering from typhus fever. Case 10.—Mingold E, aged 25, a German tailoress, went in an omnibus to Charing Cross Hospital, and was admitted, suffering from typhus fever. Besides these cases, I found, on visiting St. Thomas's Hospital, that 4 other patients had been admitted from this District, suffering from typhus fever, of which I had no previous knowledge. This fever remained in our District nearly three months, viz., from the middle of August to the 21st November. There were 22 persons attacked with it: 4 of whom died: 1 at St. Thomas's, and 3 at Stockwell Hospital. There can be no doubt that the fever originated either in Lincoln Court or Orange Court, both of which are in the area being dealt with by the Metropolitan Board of Works, under the Artizans' Dwellings Act, 1875. During the prevalence of the disease, your Board drew the attention of the Metropolitan Board of Works to the insanitary condition of the 41 property in this area, and requested them to close and demolish the condemned houses as soon as possible. The Metropolitan Board of Works acted as soon as the provisions of the Act allowed them, and at the present date the whole of the houses in this area have been pulled down for the purpose of erecting healthy dwellings for the working classes. The authorities of King's College Hospital alone had informed the local authorities of the admission of these typhus fever cases into their wards. Your Board thereupon, at my suggestion, sent the following circular letter, addressed to the Chairman of Committee of Management of the several Metropolitan hospitals:— " St. Giles District Board of Works, 199, High Holborn, W.C. " The attention of the Sanitary Committee of the Board has been recently called by their Medical Officer of Health to a source of danger of spreading typhus fever and other infectious diseases, which a little aid on the part of hospital authorities would greatly assist in removing, and asking that aid. The Guardians of the Poor send every pauper case of typhus and other infectious diseases to one of the special hospitals of the Asylum's Board, and at once inform the Medical Officer of Health of the house and room occupied by the person so removed, the room being then immediately disinfected. But patients who do not belong to the pauper class may be admitted into the general hospitals without the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health, as happened in several instances during the recent appearance of typhus in St. Giles District. Under these circumstances, the sanitary authority and its officers are unable to take such measures as may be found necessary to eradicate the centre of infection from which the patients may have been brought by disinfection of the dwellings. The District Board, therefore, requests as a great favour that when patients suffering from typhus or other infectious diseases are admitted into a general hospital from the Board's District, the hospital authorities will give to the Board information of the fact. " J. H. Jones, Clerk." This letter elicited favourable replies from many of the hospital authorities. Typhoid.—I have no special comment to make on this form of fever. 8 deaths occurred from it. 4 patients were sent to Stockwell Hospital, and all recovered. The deaths in 1878 were 19, and the decennial average 24 6. Metria (Puerperal or Lying-in Fever) was fatal to 2 females (nonhospital patients), between the ages of 20 and 40. Diarrkhæa.—In 1879, the deaths from diarrhoea and bronchitis were in an inverse ratio to each other. In consequence of the low temperature which prevailed during the summer and autumn months, there was an 42 absence of diarrhoea, which is so fatal to young children, especially the bottle-fed infants in poor districts. The total deaths were 22; of which 15 were infants under 1 year of age, and 4 between 1 and 5 years of age. In 1878, the total deaths were 50, including 47 children under 5 years of age. The decennial average is 62.6. 1 death was registered as " cholera," but on investigation it was found to be a severe case of choleraic diarrhoea. Rheumatism.—5 deaths were returned from it. This number appears small, when the excessive dampness and cold of the past season is taken into consideration. Order 2.—Enthetic. Syphilis.—13 deaths : 10 of whom were infants under 1 year. Order 3.—Dietic. Alcoholism.—6 deaths were registered as dying from intemperence. This does not include many forms of disease of liver, kidneys, &c., which are caused from excessive drinking habits. Order 4.—Parasitic. Thrush.—A baby under 1 year died from it. The following regulations for disinfecting houses, bedding, clothing, &c., were drawn up after careful deliberation by your Sanitary Commitee:— 1. The rooms, bedding, clothes, &c., of any person who has suffered from small-pox, scarlet fever, diphtheria, typhus, typhoid, or relapsing fevers, are to be disinfected. 2. The order for the disinfection to be made by the Medical Officer of Health, and addressed to the Clerk to the Board. 3. The Clerk, on receipt of the order, is to issue a statutory notice, which the Sanitary Inspector is to serve upon the owner or occupier of the infected premises, requiring him to disinfect the rooms, &c., within a time to be specified in the notice. 4. The Sanitary Inspector to superintend such disinfection, and if the statutory notice to disinfect has been neglected, or the work has been inefficiently done, he is immediately to report the same to the Medical Officer of Health, and proceed as the law directs. 5. Should the owner determine to disinfect by his own workmen, a printed handbill is to be delivered to him by the Sanitary Inspector, as follows:— "The Board of Works for the St. Giles District. " Mode of Disinfecting a Sick Room, etc. "A large earthern pan, containing two or three gallons of strong solution of chloride of lime or soda, must be provided, into which all soiled bed and body linen, towels, handkerchiefs, &c., must be thrown; 43 having been kept there for half an hour, they must be wrung out, then soaked in boiling water for half an hour, afterwards they should be washed apart from other articles. The more frequently the bed and body linen of the patient is changed the better: it ought to be done every second or third day. "On the removal of the patient, the bed and mattresses are to be placed over chairs, and blankets and woollen articles of clothing suspended on lines in the room, so that the fumes from the sulphur shall have free access to every part, the furniture, pictures, and looking glasses to be removed from the walls, the windows closed, and paper pasted over all crevices; the chimney opening of the fire-place is also to be effectually stopped up. An open iron vessel or brazier is next to be placed in the centre of the room, in which a pound or more of common sulphur, according to the size of the room, should be placed; the sulphur is then to be ignited by adding to it a few live coals; the person who does this must then leave the apartment, close the door, and paste paper over the crevices. "After the expiration of at least six hours, the room may be entered and the windows thrown open, to allow the fumes of sulphur to escape. "N.B.—As many of the disinfectants are poisonous they should be placed beyond the reach of children. "Offices, 199, High Holborn. "By order, J. Henry Jones, Clerk to the Board." 6. When the disinfection is carried out by the Board's Officers, the Sanitary Inspector, after making an inventory of the things to be disinfected, will cause them to be placed in the disinfecting chamber provided for that purpose. The Sanitary Inspector is to see that the things are duly returned after disinfection, and obtain the receipt of the owner, or some person on his or her behalf for the same. 7. No charge is made by the Board for the disinfection of the rooms. 8. The charge for disinfection to those persons who are able to pay is five shillings for each truck load or articles; if disinfected by night, the same will be ten shillings per truck load. 9. All officers and servants of tho Board are prohibited from receiving gratuities for any purpose connected with the disinfection of either rooms or clothing. 10. The Sanitary Inspector is to supervise the disinfection of premises and clothing, and to report the completion of the work to the Medical Officer of Health. CLASS II.—CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. The second great class in the Registrar-General's tables, viz., constitutional diseases, comprises the causes of 191 deaths. This class includes two orders: (1) diathetic diseases, 26; and (2) tubercular or scrofulous diseases, 165. 44 Order 1.—Diathetic Diseases. 26 deaths. The fatal diseases were:—Gout, 2; Dropsy, 5; and Cancer, 19. The deaths from the latter were spread in nearly proportions in the three Sub-Districts. Order 2.—Tubercular. 165 deaths. Scrofula caused 10 deaths. Tabes Mesenterica (or Mesenteric Disease).—8, all children. Tubercular Meningitis (Water on the Brain).—20 children. Phthisis (or Consumption).—127. The deaths from this disease were nearly four times as many in St. Giles, South, as in St. George's, Bloomsbury, which may be accounted for by the greater density of the population in the former Sub-District. Scrofulous disease is more rife amongst the children of people living in crowded dwellings. CLASS III.—LOCAL DISEASES. This great class, which is sub-divided into eight orders, named according to the systems or organs of the body which they affect, accounted for 569 deaths—nearly half the total number of deaths registered from all causes. Order 1.—Nervous System. Caused 103 deaths. The most important diseases of the order were Apoplexy, 22; Paralysis, 25; Convulsions, 21 (all children); and other Brain Diseases, 29. Order 2.—Organs of Circulation. Total deaths 45. Aneurism, 3; Heart Disease, 42. About the average number. Order 3.—Respiratory Organs. Total deaths 383. Of these Bronchitis must be credited with no less than 303; of which 98 were children under 5 years of age. The cold weather which prevailed throughout the greater portion of the year doubtless caused this excessive mortality—98 more than the preceding year. Pleurisy was fatal in 6 cases. Asthma the same number. Pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs) carried off 59. Only 7 of these deaths occurred between the ages of 5 and 40. Order 4.—Digestive Organs. Total deaths 24. The only important disease to mention in point of number of deaths is Liver Disease, which was fatal to 12; being onehalf the number of deaths for the entire order. 45 Order 5.—Urinary Organs. Total deaths 14. In Bright's Disease, 6; Diabetes, 2; and other Kidney Diseases, 6. Order 6.—Organs of Generation. Order 7.—Organs of Locomotion. Order 8.—Integumentary System. No deaths were recorded in either of these last-named orders. CLASS IV.—DEVELOPMENTAL DISEASES. This class contains four orders, viz.: (1) Diseases of Children, (2) Diseases of Adults, (3) Diseases of Old People, (4) Diseases of Nutrition. The total deaths in the class were 148. Order 1.—Diseases of Children. 20 children died from Premature Birth, 6 from Teething, and 3 from Spina Bifida. Order 2.—Diseases of Adults. 3 women died in Childbirth : half the number reported for the preceding year. Order 3.—Diseases of Old People. 42 persons died old: 27 between 60 and 80 years, and 15 at 80 years and upwards. Order 4.—Diseases of Nutrition. Atrophy and Debility.—74 deaths were returned; 71 being children under 5 years. CLASS V. VIOLENT DEATHS. 36 deaths are distributed over the four orders comprised in this class. Order 1.—Accident or Negligence. Total deaths 31; of which 4 were Fractures or Contusions, 1 Poison, and 24 Suffocation. Of this last mentioned, 18 were infants under 1 year of age, accidentally suffocated, either by the bed-clothes or overlaid by the parent. 40 Order 3.—Murder or Manslaughter. 2 deaths were returned under these headings: 1 infant and 1 adult. Order 4.—Suicide. 1 adult died from Poison (opium), and 1 from Hanging. The detailed verdicts of the several causes of death in this class, are more clearly set forth in the following table:— Inquests. During the year, 96 inquests were held. 60 of the deaths occurred from "natural" causes, 31 from "accidental" causes, and 5 from " wilful " or " suicidal " causes. 7 were parishioners of St. George, Bloomsbury ; 69 „ „ St. Giles, South; 20 .. St. Giles, North. The following were the verdicts returned by the juries:— Cause of Death. Total Natural Causes. Apoplexy, diseases of the brain and spinal cord 15 Diseases of the heart and aneurism 13 Diseases of the respiratory and pulmonary organs 20 Diseases of the kidney 2 Alcoholism 3 Erysipelas Mesenteric disease 1 Measles 1 Cold, debility, atrophy, and exhaustion Accidental Causes. Injury to temple from a fall 1 Injury to elbow joint (blood poisoning) 1 Injury to brain from fall, knocked down by a horse in Rotten Row 1 Injury to neck, dislocation from getting impaled between bannisters of stairs 1 Injury to ribs (fracture) 1 Poison (opium) 1 Suffocation 24 Otherwise 1 Wilful Causes. Injury to spinal cord from fracture and compression 1 1 Hanging 2 Poison (cyanide of potassium) 1 Total 96 47 Deaths Registered, but not Certified. Fourteen deaths were returned as not certified, which means that the deceased persons had not been attended daring their last illness by a registered medical practitioner. Though this number is considerably above the average for this District, I found upon investigation that only 2 had died without some kind of medical aid. Ex. gr., 4 of the deaths (infants) had been attended by the female staff of the British Lying-in Hospital; 2 children by medical students; 4 had been (almost up to the time of death) out-patients of the Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street; 1 by an M.D. (qualified, but not registered); 2 were unaccounted for. Sanitary Work. The Report of the sanitary work carried out under the supervision of the Sanitary Inspectors will be found in Table VI., Appendix; but this does not represent the whole of the work, for many improvements of houses, &c., are carried out by owners at the inspectors' request or suggestion, without recourse to legal proceedings. Legal Proceedings under the Sanitary Acts.—The owners of 21 houses refused to comply with your order, whereupon proceedings were taken before a magistrate, and orders obtained in each case to carry out the necessary work. Overcrowding has been reduced in a number of houses during the past year. In 9 cases, notices were served on the owners, and the number of the inmates duly reduced. Underground Dwellings.—8 notices were served on owners to discontinue the letting of underground rooms, used as dwellings contrary to the Act. Nuisances from the Kf.epino of Animals (Cats).—On visiting a small room in Butcher's Court, Drury Lane, I counted between 15 and 20 cats in it, the stench was horrible, and a great nuisance. No persuasion could prevail on the occupant to part with her pets, so magisterial proceedings were taken to enforce their removal. Slaughter Houses.—On the 28th October, the Middlesex Magistrates, at their Petty Sessions, held at the Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, granted licences for slaughter houses to the following butchers, who had previously carried out the works ordered by your Sanitary Committee, and which works were supervised by your Surveyor. Locality. Licensees. No. 6, Drury Lane Mr. Elan. 23, Store Street Mr. Belch. 11, Kenton Street Mr. Dunford. 11, Marchmont Street Mr. Edwards. 36, do. Mr. Vernum. Compton Mews Mr. Philp. 48 Cow Sheds.— Before granting tho annual licences, the justices required evidence that the applicants had conformed to the regulations drawn up in pursuance of section 34 of the 41 & 42 Vict. c. 74 (Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1878), being an Order in Council made on the 9th July, 1879, "for the carrying on the trade of cowkeeper or dairyman." After hearing the report of your Officers, the Magistrates granted licences to the under-mentioned cow-keepers :— 1. Mr. Rees Lewis, No. 1, Coal Yard. Dimensions 28ft. x 17ft. x 15ft. = 7140 cubic feet. 10 cows allowed. 2. Messrs. Bonner & Capper, No. 56, Great Coram Street. Dimensions 29ft. x 16ft. x 8 = 3712 cubic feet. 6 cows allowed. 3. Messrs. Bonner & Capper, No. 19, Tavistock Mews. Dimensions 24ft. x 22ft. x 10ft. = 5280 cubic feet. 11 cows allowed. The application for a renewal of licence for the premises at 1½, Little Wild Street, was refused. It is stated by the Registrar-General that " a considerable improvement has taken place in the health of London in recent years, thus the average annual mortality to 1,000 inhabitants was 24.1, in the 30 years 1841—70, whereas in the 9 years 1871—79 it fell to 22.9, showing a decrease of 5 per cent." Our recent annual death-rates prove that we can share in this improvement, owing, there can be no doubt, to the measures taken by your Board for carrying out the several Sanitary Acts. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, S. R LOVETT, Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, Edin., &.c.; Member of Council of Society of Medical Officers of Health; Medical Officer of Health for the District. June, 1880. 49 APPENDIX.

TO THE BOARD OF WORKS OF THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen,— Daring the year ending on the 31st of last March, I received from your Inspector, Mr. John Hoyle, 272 samples of articles of food and drugs for analysis, consisting of arrowroot, butter, bread, baking powder, flour, milk, condensed milk, white pepper, black pepper, mustard, green tea, sugar, sweets, essence of coffee, vinegar, gin, whisky, brandy, rum, claret, sulphate of quinine, iodide of potassium, sweet spirit of nitre, and seidlitz powders. Of these samples, 32 were found to be adulterated, namely, 11 samples of milk, 17 of butter, 3 of rum, and 1 of gin. There were besides 11 other samples of milk in which there was some evidence of adulteration, but not sufficient to justify proceedings being taken. The increase in the proportion of adulterated samples this year as compared with the previous year has arisen from the numerous cases of adulterated butter which have occurred. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, 17, Bloomsbury Square, 23rd.June, 1880. T. REDWOOD.
