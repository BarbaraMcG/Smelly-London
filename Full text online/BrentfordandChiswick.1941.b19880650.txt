School Medical Officer. -1- BOROUGH OF BRENTFORD & CHISWICK PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, TOWNHALL, CHISWICK. To the Mayor, Alderman and Councillors of the Borough of Brentford and Chiswick. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, When the year opened the work of the Department was affected seriously by war conditions, but as time went on and the "blitz" was forgotten and more children returned from reception areas our activities became more normal. The attendances at the Clinics increased and the special Clinics were re-opened. The Diphtheria Immunisation Clinic (which re-opened in December of last year) was very well attended and a second weekly session was started at the Brentford Clinic. Also a third weekly session for Ante-natal and Post-natal work had to be held. Two new features during the year were firstly the institution, on a large scale, of meals for school children and secondly the opening of a War-time Nursery for 60 children from birth to 5 years of age in the Brentford area. As regard the health of the district the tables on pages 14 and 17l?of this report give an indication of the prevalence and incidence of Infectious Disease. It will be noted that Measles and Chicken-pox were prevalent during the first six months and Whooping Cough cases were found in the greatest number during the second quarter of the year. Scabies gave us a good deal of trouble as there is no Cleansing Centre in the Borough. The Infantile Mortality Rate was 51 and that figure was calculated on 30 infantile deaths of which 13 or nearly half were due to prematurity or congenital malformation. The increase of Tuberculosis in. the country as a whole is a matter of grave concern to Public Health Authorities. In this Borough the total figures are perhaps not very indicative, but the incidence of the pulmonary form of this disease in males between 15 and 35 years is significant. These figures for notified new cases are:- 1938 - 14 cases in 1939 - 36 cases, in 1940 - 47 cases and in 1941 - 52 cases. The total figures for all forms and all ages are:- 1938 - 108 cases with 40 deaths, 1939 - 85 cases with 41 deaths 1940 - 94 cases with 38 deaths and 1941 - 89 cases with 42 deaths. Miss Edwards, Health Visitor and School Nurse, a member of the Territorial Nursing Reserve, was called up for service with the Forces and Brian Smith joined the R.A.F. and gained his "wings" as a bomber pilot. I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, R.C. LEANING. -2- SECTION 'A' EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS: The number of live-births, still-births, and deaths are those REGISTERED (but excluding re-registered) during the calendar year, adjusted for inward and outward transfers.
