THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF LAMBETH. EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT. Pursuant to the 198th Section of the "Metropolis Management Act," the Vestry present the Eighteenth Report of their proceedings, under the Acts before mentioned, and of Works completed and improvements effected, during the year ending the 25th day of March, 1874. During the past year, new Paving Works of great extent have been executed, Improvements effected, and Public Lighting increased, in relating to which the Vestry have been actuated by the desire of extending the benefits thereof as widely as possible, endeavouring to avoid any serious increase of local taxation. The Works and Improvements referred to are hereafter specifically described under the respective heads of Sewerage, and Street and House drainage, &c., at page 5; Highways, New Works, and Improvements at page 6; Lighting matters at page 8; and Sanitary matters at page 10. The Report also contains an account in abstract, showing the Receipts and Expenditure of the Vestry for the year ending at lady-day last; also a summary statement of all Contracts entered into, and of monies owing to, and debts and liabilities owing by the Vestry. These accounts have been duly audited by the Auditors, elected by the Parishioners. For the purpose of efficient publication, an abstract account, of amounts received and paid by the Lambeth Burial Board, from the 1st day of April, 1873, to the 31st day of March, 1874, is set forth at pages 38 and 39. The accounts of the said Board have been duly audited. 6 THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF LAMBETH.

The total number of Lamps lighted by the Vestry at the date of the 25th of March, 1874, was 3018—and the cost of Lighting for the year, including the erection of new columns, removals, and other expenses, amounts to £13,083 2s. 2d. Periodical experiments with the Photometer have been regularly made; and monthly reports submitted by the Chemical Examiner have shewn that the illuminating power and purity of the Gas supplied by the several Companies, have been up to the standard which they are bound to supply.

J. MacCORMACK, M.B. (TCD.) Gentlemen, I now present the Eighteenth Annual Report on the Health and Mortality of the Parish of Lambeth for the year 1873-4, and have to congratulate you, that this District still maintains its character for healthiness, not only as regards its low Death-Rate, but also for its immunity from any large amount of Zymotic, or Preventible Diseases. The calculations have been made as hitherto on the Census Returns of 1871, but if we were to take into consideration the estimated increase of population since that period our Death-Rate would be considerably lower. The number of Births registered in the Parish during the year 1873-74 were 8321, of which 2042 were registered in the first, 2032 in the second, 2084 in the third, and 2163 in the fourth Quarters of the year. The Births have exceeded those of the previous year by 134. The deaths during the year were 4983, being somewhat in excess of the previous year, but 754 less than the year 1871-72. The excess of Births over Deaths amounted to 3338. This is very satisfactory as compared with the two previous years, which were 3512 and 2406 respectively. The excess of Births over Deaths has been in all the Districts with the exception of Lambeth 1st Church, where the Deaths exceeded the Births by 2, but when we analyse the actual facts 11 by deducting the Deaths occurring in St. Thomas's Hospital of entire strangers to the district, it will be seen that there has been a considerable increase in this district, as well as in all the others. The largest increase has been in Kennington 1st, amounting to 715; Brixton stands next at 584, and Waterloo Road 2nd ranks third at 581. The Deaths during the Four Quarters of the year were as follows:— First Quarter 1142 Second Quarter 1151 Third Quarter 1408 Fourth Quarter 1282 The Deaths were 308 in excess of the previous year, but were 754 less than the year 1872-3. Deducting the Deaths which have occurred in the different Public Institutions of strangers brought from all parts of the country, amounting to 335, the Deaths will be but 4650. 235 of these were at St. Thomas's, and 86 at Stockwell Hospitals. The Births and Deaths during each quarter of the year in each of the eight divisions of the Parish are shown in Table II., from which it will be seen that in Waterloo 1st District there were 554 Births and 333 Deaths during the year; in Waterloo Road 2nd, 981 Births and 400 Deaths; in Lambeth Church 1st, 760 Births and 762 Deaths (but of the latter 342 occurred in St. Thomas's Hospital, of which 235 were strangers to the district; this materially reduces the Death Rate of Lambeth 1st, which at first sight appears 2 in excess of the Births); in Lambeth Church 2nd, 1662 Births and 1154 Deaths, 352 of the latter took place in the Workhouse; in Kennington 1st Part, 1524 Births and 809 Deaths; in Kennington 2nd, 1090 Births and 600 Deaths; in Brixton, 1315 Births and 737 Deaths, 128 of the latter occurred in the Stockwell Hospital, 86 of which were strangers to the district (this reduces the Death Rate proper of Brixton to its usual normal proportion of 17 per 1000;; and in Norwood, 435 12 Births and 188 Deaths, 7 of the latter occurred in the Children's Workhouse. The comparative Mortality of Lambeth, the entire of the Metropolis, and the South District, is shown in Table III. The Mortality of Lambeth this year does not bear as favourable a comparison as it did the two previous years with that of the whole Metropolis, or of the Southern District of which it is a part. The cause of this has been from the great mortality caused by Measles and Whooping Cough, especially fatal to children under 5 years of age. Had it not been for this, there would have been a very favourable mortality from the more serious forms of Zymotic Diseases. The almost complete freedom from Small Pox, which raged so extensively and fatally during the two previous years, is a matter of great satisfaction. Out of a total of only 13 deaths from this disease, 8 were strangers to the district, leaving but 5 cases belonging properly to Lambeth. The most healthy districts were Norwood, Brixton, Kennington 2nd, and Kennington 1st. The Mortality of Norwood being 151.50 per 10,000, Brixton (after deducting the deaths of strangers in the Hospitals at Stockwell) 171.80 per 10,000, in Kennington 2nd 192.10 per 10,000, and Kennington 1st 195.90. The four less healthy were Lambeth 2nd, Waterloo 1st, Lambeth 1st, and Waterloo 2nd The Mortality in Lambeth 2nd (after deducting the deaths in the Workhouse) was 223.80, in Waterloo 1st (after deducting the deaths in the Hospital situate in that district) was 221.60, in Lambeth 1st (after deducting the deaths in St. Thomas's Hospital) was 220.60, and in Waterloo 2nd (after similar deduction) was 209.60. By the same table it is shewn that one person amongst every 41.87 living, died in London during the year; one amongst 42.75 living, died in the South District; and one amongst every 41.80 living, died in Lambeth. In the Waterloo Road 1st there were one amongst 42.80 living, died during the year; in Waterloo 2nd, one, amongst 46.17 living, died; in Lambeth Church 1st one 13 amongst 26.27 living, died (but when we deduct the deaths in St. Thomas's Hospital we find that the proportion would be one dead to 45.33 living); in Lambeth Church 2nd one amongst 31.03, but making the same deductions as above, the proportion would be one amongst 44.93 living, died; in Kennington 1st one amongst 51.04 living, died; in Kennington 2nd one amongst 52.05 living, died; in Brixton one amongst 48.07, but deducting the deaths in Stockwell Hospital, the proportion would be one amongst 58.20 living, died; and in Norwood one among 66 living died. The Deaths from Epidemic Diseases during 1873-4 are shown in Table IV. They amounted to 847, and as compared with last year (811) shew a small increase (36), but is considerably less than the year 1871-2 and 1872-3, which were respectively 1121 and 1750, they were only 17.40 per 1000 of the whole mortality. The slight increase in the Deaths from Epidemic Diseases was caused by the number of cases of measles, diarrhoea, and fevers. There were this year 192 Deaths from measles, as against 54 the previous year; 189 deaths from fevers, as against 117; and 244 from diarrhoea, as against 236. Scarlet fever and whooping cough show a decrease as against last year. At Table V. will be seen the number of cases of illness from Contagious Diseases attended by the Poor Law Medical Officer during each quarter of the year. The total number, 605, as against 582 last year, shew also a slight increase, caused by Fevers and Measles, especially the latter, which were 185 as compared with 58 the previous year, but there is a satisfactory decrease as regards Small Pox, which were only 7, as against 140; of the 605 cases attended, 114 occurred in the 1st quarter, 222 in the 2nd, 180 in the 3rd, and 89 in the last quarter of the year. The number and character of the Nuisances removed, and the General Sanitary Measures carried out will be seen in Table I. The Nuisances abated or removed amounted to 3112; in addition there was a large amount of Sanitary work carried out by 14 disinfecting houses and rooms where Small Fox and other contagious diseases existed. The number of houses cleansed, which were in an unwholesome condition were 319; 245 houses requiring proper drainage, drained; 29 cesspoools abolished; 339 obstructed drains remedied; 272 defective drains trapped; 1084 houses without proper water supply provided therewith; 42 houses provided with means of ventilation; 7 houses where dampness and foul smells existed remedied; 58 yards of houses repaved and limewashed; 387 dust bins erected; 228 accumulations of dung removed; 29 cases of decomposed animal and vegetable matter removed; 17 foul urinals cleansed, removed, or improved; 56 closets provided or improved; 54 dangerous structures removed; 2 trade nuisances abated; 28 lots of swine, consisting of 90 pigs, removed; 23 lots of unwholesome fish, numbering 2116 condemned and destroyed; 1 case of unwholosome meat, weighing 3.lbs., condemned and destroyed; 15 obstructed or untrapped gullies remedied; 10 cases of animals improperly kept in housos, remedied; 1 case of unsound fruit, consisting of 300 oranges, seized; 47 Houses registered under the Sanitary Act of 1866, 29 & 30 Viet., cap. 90. In addition to the above 261 houses have been disinfected in which Small Pox, Fevers, and other contagious diseases have occurred, and various sanitary improvements effected therein; and in 135 cases articles of bod and bedding, similarly infected, were either disinfected or destroyed. The number of Licensed Slaugterhouses visited were 105, Cowhouses 99, and Bakehouses 227, in all of which the usual periodical cleansing and whitewashing was enforced, and many other improvements effected. In order to complete these necessary works 1585 notices were served, and 208 summonses and orders issued. 15 The following have been the cases in which, on conviction before the Magistrates, penalties were inflicted together with costs:— Name. Address. Occupation. Class of Offence. Amount of Fines. B. O. conner 18, Albert Embankment Contractor Trade Nuisance Order of Prohibition. T. Starks and T.

Blinks Palmerston Terrace, Cold Harbour Lane Butcher Exposing diseased Meat for sale Fined £2 and costs. 16 In my last Report I congratulated the Vestry on the Epidemic of Small Pox being nearly extinct. I can still continue to do so in this Report. It will be seen that there were only 13 deaths from this disease during the year, 8 of which were strangers to the district brought to Stockwell Hospital, leaving but 5 deaths chargeable to Lambeth. The Poor Law Medical Officers attended only 7 during the same period. It will be seen that there has been much Sanitary work done in Lambeth during the past year, and one of the chief requirements that I alluded to in my last Report, has been in operation during a short period of the year. I allude to the Rules and Regulations for the prevention of over-crowding; it will be seen that 47 houses have been already registered and with the best results, this is however an act that requires to be put in force with great caution, and only in extreme cases where other means have been found ineffectual. I have not met with any opposition or objection on the part of the owners or occupiers of the houses already registered. The 2nd requirement, that of a Mortuary, has not yet been carried out, in consequence of the difficulties attendant on obtaining a suitable site, but whilst these pages are going through the press (August 7th), I am enabled to state that considerable progress has been made towards this object, and I hope before another year's Report we shall have one suitable Mortuary, with dead house, post-mortem room, &c., erected for the inner liberties. As regards the 3rd requirement alluded to in my last Report, namely, the erection of Baths and Wash-houses, I still maintain the views I then expressed as to their necessity in every Sanitary point, and whilst we have not yet had any Wash-houses erected, I am glad to find 2 large Bathing Establishments have been opened in different localities, namely, at Brixton and the Oval, these are, I hope, but a commencement of a still greater want, namely, providing places where the Poor can do the washing, drying, and ironing of the clothes away from confined rooms, 17 and closely crowded courts and alleys, many of which are sadly deficient of free circulation of air and light. Since the date of last Report, the Act dealing with the Adulteration of food, Drink, and Drugs, has been in force in this district, and at Table 6 will be found the results, shewing the number of articles submitted for analysis, and the number found to be adulterated. The following Table shows the cases in which convictions have taken place and flues inflicted. Name. Address. Articles. Amount of Fines. Date.
