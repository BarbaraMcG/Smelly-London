Leatherdale and H. Glass, the former of whom had served the Parish before the coming into force of the Metropolis Management Adt, 1855, and had ever since then taken a most acftive part in parochial matters. Two of the parishioners, too, who had played important parts in regard to the Parish work, have also passed away, viz., Mr. S. Ludbrook and Mr. H. Gardner, the former of whom had filled nearly all the parochial offices. Messrs. Alfred Furness and John Dewson Kemp were re-eleifted Churchwardens, and Messrs. Isaac James Booth, Charles Hart Bardouleau, Alfred E. Wood, and Thomas Cook, were elecfted Overseers for the year. Churchwardens and Overseers. At the annual election of Vestrymen, the unusual result was witnessed of one gentleman (Mr. A. Wood) being returned as Vestryman for two wards. Under the Adf, he was put to his eletftion for which ward he would sit, and an order was made for a fresh election in the other ward. Annual Election. The Clerk to the Vestry, during the year, reported to the Parliamentary Committee on over 100 Bills and Parliamentary proceedings, and in every case where a Bill, in the opinion of the Committee, specially affected the Hamlet, they took some steps to get their views before Parliament.

The Bills of [several other Railway Companies having a like object. j It will be observed that of the aforegoing Bills, several were mentioned in the Report of last year as having been introduced, or were expecfted to be introduced, into Parliament, and the details of some of them were given. The Vestry now beg to complete the history of the various proceedings with regard to them. 7 METROPOLITAN AND LONDON, TILBURY AND SOUTHEND RAILWAY BILL. As prognosticated in the Report of last year, the united opposition which the promoters found that they would have to face, caused them to withdraw the Bill. Metropolitan and London Tilbury & Southend Railway Bill. THE METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS (THAMES CROSSINGS) BILL. The nature and object of this Bill will be found dealt with at pages 7 to g of last year's Report. The Bill, as was expedted, was, on the motion of Mr. Ritchie, M.P., referred to a hybrid Committee of the House of Commons, and the Vestry were represented before the Committee by counsel and witnesses. Metropolitan Board of Works (Thames Crossings) Bill. The Tower (Duplex) Bridge Bill being treated as a competing scheme, was referred to the same Committee. The hearing occupied twenty-one days, and, in the result, the preamble of both schemes, so far as related to the subway and the bridge, were declared not proven. In the course of the enquiry, a great variety of details as to the nature of the subway and the cost, were brought out for the first time. It was found that the scheme had been considerably altered, as it was proposed to construct hydraulic lifts at each end of the subway, to assist, as was asserted, the heavy traffic. The gradients on the north side were found to be 1 in 25 for 600 yards, and on the south side 1 in 27 for 500 yards, and as these were almost as bad as the worst approach to London Bridge, the lifts were no doubt suggested as a means which might induce the heavy traffic to use the subway. The cost of working and maintaining the lifts was, it was argued, very considerable, but opinions differed considerably. It was, however, generally considered that, at the lowest estimate, if the expenses of working the lifts were capitalized and added to the estimated cost of the subway, the cost would not be less than ^2,200,000. The Vestry adted in entire accord with the neighbouring parishes of Limehouse and Poplar, which were also represented before the Committee, and it was generally felt that the scheme was one of the least beneficial ones that could be devised for East London. The Committee of the House of Commons made a special report on the matter, and stated it as their opinion, that means of communication were most urgently required, and that an opening bridge should be placed at Tower Hill and a subway in the neighbourhood of Shadwell, and they further expressed a hope that the City of London should undertake the first-named work, whilst the Metropolitan Board of Works contemporaneously carried out the last-named. As will be seen hereafter, the City of London have accepted the responsibility of carrying out the Committee's suggestion as regards them, but the Vestry have to deplore that the Metropolitan Board of Works have not done so as regards their portion. 8 The expenses incurred by the Vestry in opposing the Bill were heavy, and amounted to nearly £400, but they feel that it was well expended, and that it assisted in stopping the progress of a measure which would, if passed, have sanctioned the expenditure of an enormous sum on a useless objecft. The Vestry have done all in their power by memorials and otherwise, to induce the Metropolitan Board of Works to proceed in providing what is an admitted want in the East of London, but without any success. The Vestry, conjointly with neighbouring Boards, memorialized the Home Secretary (Sir W. V. Harcourt) to press upon the Metropolitan Board of Works the necessity for proceeding and sent a deputation to meet other deputations to support the memorial. The deputation was introduced by Mr. Bryce, M.P., who spoke in favor, but the Home Secretary, in his reply, instead of addressing himself to the point urged on him, gave an address upon the necessity of passing his London Government Bill, which would, according to him, prove a panacea for all the ills affecting the government of London. There being no means of combatting his arguments, the deputation had to retire without having achieved much good. London Government Bill Perhaps the most important Bill, however, which was introduced was the London Government Bill, which would have affected the whole Metropolis, and so far as the Vestry itself is concerned, would have blotted it out of existence, and this Report would not have had to be written. It would be out of place to go into full particulars of the scheme, since it has not been pressed, but it may be well to say that the effect of the Bill, if passed, would have been to form one body consisting of 240 members to govern the whole Metropolis, and the powers, duties, and liabilities of the present Corporation and of the Common Council thereof, of the Commissioners of Sewers, of the Aldermen, of the Metropolitan Board of Works, of the present Vestries and District Boards, of the Justices of the Peace in Middlesex, Surrey, and Kent, exercising jurisdiction within the area of the new Corporation, of all Commissioners for Paving, Lighting, &c., of all District Boards, of all Commissioners for Public Baths or Libraries, were, after the 1st May, 1885, to cease, and to be thereafter transferred to, and vested in, the new governing body. Without going further into particulars, the Vestry think that the proposal, as shewn, was sufficient of itself to condemn the measure, even had the clauses for working out the scheme been satisfactory, but these were all based on making some government department the ruling power in all cases of disagreement. The Clerk to the Vestry prepared a most voluminous Report on the effect of the Bill, and the Vestry deemed it proper that it should be printed, as it afforded a most useful reference to the clauses of the Bill. 9 According to their expressed intentions, the Vestry gave the matter their best and most impartial consideration, and granted the use of the Vestry Hall for several public meetings; and, in order to test the general feeling of the parish, they, as far as they could, by employing canvassers to make house visitation, and, in the result, they presented to Parliament a petition against the Bill, signed by over 5,000 ratepayers. The Vestry, moreover, appointed delegates to attend meetings elsewhere, and, as a result, the Vestry feel bound to express its opinion that the cry for reform is not that of the ratepayers generally, but of a comparatively few agitators who have some ulterior object in view. The Committee of the whole Board which had the matter under consideration, invited the Members of Parliament for the Tower Hamlets to attend and discuss the question, and Mr. Ritchie accepted the invitation, but Mr. Bryce was unable to do so, and such an adtive interest and trouble did the former of those gentlemen take in opposing the Bill, that, on its being withdrawn, the Vestry passed a special vote of thanks to him for the interest he had taken, and for his courteous conduct in dealing with the matter. The Waterworks Clauses Aft, 1847, Amendment Bill did not pass last Session, but has been again introduced this Session, and such an amount of public opinion has been brought to bear on the subjeft generally, that the Vestry have every hope that the Bill may become law, and that the question of what is the "annual value" of property may be properly determined. Waterworks Clauses Act, Amendment Bill. As has before been mentioned the House of Commons Committee, on the Metropolitan Board of Works Bill of last Session, recommended that an opening bridge should be constructed across the Thames, from Tower Hill to Horsleydown, and, at the same time, suggested that the Corporation of London should undertake the work. Corporation of London (Tower Bridge) Bill. The Corporation forthwith, upon the Report becoming known, took the necessary steps for carrying out the recommendations of the Committee, and have introduced a Bill for liberty to build a bascule bridge at the point suggested, the cost of which (amounting to at least £750,000) is to be raised out of the funds of the Bridge House Estates. When it is considered that only a very small portion of the proposed work is situate within the City of London, and that the ratepayers of the Metropolis will therefore get the bridge (if the Bill pass) without cost to them, the unselfish liberality of the Corporation is evident, and the Vestry accordingly passed a resolution expressing its high appreciation of the conduft of the Corporation in the matter. The ratepayers may rely that the Vestry will use its utmost endeavours to assist the Corporation, so far as it possibly can, to bring the Bill to a successful issue. The question of the re-distribution of the parliamentary representation of the country having been brought forward, and it being proposed to constitute Mile End Old Town a separate Parliamentary Representation B 10 borough, with two divisions, each having a separate member, a scheme was prepared by the Churchwardens and Overseers for constituting the North and East Wards of the Hamlet into one division, and the Centre, South and West Wards into another, and this scheme was approved by the Vestry. Dusting and Cleansing. The question of the means of disposal of the street sweepings, and dust, and refuse, from the Hamlet, has been a source of the gravest consideration during the year, and the continued depression in trade renders the task still more difficult. The West Ham Local Board are most vigilant in trying to stop anything of an offensive nature being carried into their district, and the street sweepings, which are allowed to be sent to the Vestry's Shoot at Carpenter's Road, are subjected to close scrutiny. The old wharf known as Devon Wharf, alongside the Regent's Canal, being unoccupied, was placed at the Vestry's disposal for a short time, free of charge, with a view of seeing if barges returning to the Kentish brickfields would take any of the dust, &c., and it proving, so far as could be judged, during the time tried, that they would, the Vestry have taken the premises for twelve months, at a rent of £90, with a view of further trying what can be done. The subject of the disposal of the dust and ashes, however, becomes yearly a more difficult one to deal with, not only in this Hamlet but throughout the Metropolis generally. The Surveyor to the Vestry has given considerable attention to it, and the Vestry beg to refer to his Report appended hereto. Keep of Horses. The following is a statement showing the persons who have supplied the corn and fodder for the Vestry's horses and the prices paid:— Date. Tenders accepted. Contractors. Clover. 1st. cut. Meadow Hay.

Paving and Making up Streets. louring the year the Vestry have passed the necessary resolutions for the paving and making-up of the following streets, at the expense of the owners of the properties abutting thereon respectively, viz.:— 11 Cleveland-grove, Eric-street, Maritime-street, Lockhart-st., and Ropery-street. The new portion of the railway over Morpeth-street has been constructed, but the Great Eastern Railway has not yet proceeded with the alteration of the original bridge, as provided by the Act, but it is expected that they will shortly do so. 7 Morpeth Street Bridge. In consequence of the increasing traffic in Devonshire-street, part of which is unpaved, the annual cost of keeping it in repair has been of late very great, and the Vestry, therefore, have taken into consideration the propriety of paving that part not paved, and have determined to pave it. Paving Streets. The condition of the paving in White Horse-lane, between Ely-terrace and Stepney-green, being very bad, the Vestry have resolved to re-pave it. To carry out the works, which will cost about £6,500, the Vestry have determined to borrow the money, and extend the repayment over twenty years, and they have every belief that they will be able to obtain the loan from the Metropolitan Board of Works, at a rate of interest not exceeding 3¼ per cent. As was anticipated would be the case, after the decision of the case of Blackmore v. The Vestry, the claims for compensation for damage alleged to have been incurred through some default of the Vestry have greatly increased, and this year there have been no less than seven. Claims for Damages for Accidents. The facts were, in every case, thoroughly sifted, and in six cases the Vestry were advised to, and did, deny their liability, and nothing more has been heard of them. In the remaining case there appeared some right in the claim, and, on advice, the Vestry settled it at the small sum of £10. The Vestry are determined, so far as they can, to resist any improper claims. The conveyance of Trafalgar-square was, in due course, completed, and the Vestry took possession. In consequence of the prevailing depression in trade, and the great number ot persons unemployed, some charitable persons placed considerable sums of money in the hands of the Metropolitan Public Garden Boulevard and Playground Association, to be used in the employment of such persons in laying out open spaces as gardens, and that Association immediately applied to the Vestry for liberty so to lay out Trafalgar-square, which application was granted. Open Spaces and Improvements. Bye-laws are being prepared for the government of the square. The Vestry cannot but recognise the very useful work which is being done by the Association referred to. The Association having secured and laid out as a garden Carlton-square, applied to the Vestry to take over the charge 12 and maintenance, but the Vestry felt bound to decline, as, in their opinion, the ground was too small to give a benefit to the ratepayers at all commensurate with the probable cost of future care and maintenance. The same Association also made liberal offers to contribute to the cost of planting trees in the principal roads in the Hamlet, if the Vestry would afterwards maintain them, but, as the Vestry has, for some years, tried the experiment of growing trees by the side of the Mile End-road with but indifferent success, the Vestry felt bound reluctantly to decline the offers. Re-numbering of Streets. Over head Wires. The north side of Bow Common-lane has been re-numbered during the year. The question of the right of the Vestries and District Boards of London to deal with overhead wires has been the subject of, judicial decision, and it was held that the Vestries and District Boards have not such a property in streets as to entitle them to maintain an action for an injunction against the erection of wires across a street, if the wire be at such a height as not to cause appreciable danger to the public or to the traffic. In the judgments, however, the Judges intimated that if a danger really existed, in all probability the Vestry would be right in taking action. The decision is quite in accordance with the advice which the Clerk to the Vestry gave to them. Sanitary In view of the possible appearance of cholera in the autumn of last year, the Vestry passed special resolutions empowering the Sanitary Committee to take measures to deal with it, in case the necessity arose, but the Vestry are pleased to say that it became unnecessary for them to do so. Jobbing Sewers. On the expiration of the jobbing sewers contract, tenders were invited, and that of Mr. W. Finch accepted. Artizans and Laborers' Dwellings Act, 1868. The Vestry were compelled to take proceedings under the Artizans' and Laborers' Dwellings Act, 1868, in respect of Nos. 1 to 17 (odd numbers) and 2 to 26 (even numbers), Frimleystreet. Under the existing law, an owner can, in certain cases, compel the Vestry to purchase the property in respect of which notice has been given, and this has proved a great drawback in the working of the Act. I he owner of the houses in Frimley-street, however, undertook to execute all necessary works: Overcrowding. 1 he Vestry's officers have had considerable difficulty in dealing with the evil of overcrowding, as, in consequence of the want of employment, there has been increased tendency among the working classes to gather together as much as possible to save rents. Regulations under the Sanitary Acts. The Vestry having determined to put in force the powers given by the Sanitary Acts, enabling them to make regulations for houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, most carefully considered regulations submitted to them, and having approved of them, directed them to be sent for confumation by the Local Government Board, as provided by the Act. That Board made numerous alterations, but, after 13 considerable correspondence and an interview, regulations were agreed on, and the same having been adopted by the Vestry and confirmed by the Local Government Board, are now in force in the Hamlet. The Vestry are empowered to make an order declaring that the regulations shall be applicable to any house in the Hamlet which is let in manner described. During the year the Vestry has caused to be erected a urinal Urinal, of an improved kind at West Arbor-street. In consequence of the continued epidemic of small-pox, the Vestry, with a view of getting early information of cases, and of their being properly attended to, made arrangements with two of the Medical Officers and the three Relieving Officers of the Guardians for their assistance being given, to supply such information in all cases coming under their notice, and the plan was found to work very beneficially and economically. Small Pox Epidemic. In consideration of the services rendered to the Vestry the Vestry granted £21 to each of the Medical Officers, and £15 15s. each to the Relieving Officers, and also £15 15s. to the Inspector of Nuisances for extra services in the disinfection of houses, &c. Complaints have, for years, been constantly made of the noxious vapours which are given off through the ventilators of the sewers, and numerous things have been devised to remedy the complaints, but all have had some objection raised to them. Disinfedting Apparatus for Sewers' Ventilators. It is clear that the ventilators cannot be stopped up, or the gases would find their way through the drains of houses. Mr. J. M. Knight, the Surveyor to the Vestry, has given considerable attention to the subject, and made a lengthy trial of an invention of his own, with, in his view, such satisfactory results that he patented it. Subsequently, on the matter being brought to the notice of the Vestry, they had trial of it made in a few places, and certainly, in all cases where it was adopted, complaints ceased, and the Vestry have recently caused the apparatus to be fixed in several places in the Hamlet, and so far with every appearance of success. The greatest part of the cost is in constructing a suitable chamber for the apparatus, but this is only a matter of about £2, and when once done is always available. The apparatus itself is of a very inexpensive nature, and the annual cost of the disinfectant to keep it efficient not more than 2s. The Vestry earnestly hope that it may prove the success which it promises to be, but in any event must congratulate its Surveyor on his gallant attempt to overcome a great difficulty. The expense of the annual election of Vestrymen and Auditors, in 1884, was £40 7s. 6d. Financial The expense of the bye election, in consequence of the double return at the annual election, was £4 14s. 6d. Expenses of Annual Eledtion. The grant of £128 15s. 6d. in aid of maintenance of disturn piked roads has again been received. . Disturnpiked roads. 14 PoorRate. The poor-rate again shows a large increase, being 3/1 in the £, as against 2/11 in the £ last year, and 2/7 in the £ in the previous year. This has caused the Vestry still to keep its own expenditure as low as possible, although, as pointed out last year, not to the extent that it had done. It is hoped and confidently anticipated that the poor-rate will not, during the next year, be so high. General, Lighting, and Sewers' Rates. The Vestry's Calls for General, Lighting and Sewers Rates have been as follows:— For General Rate, equal to 2s. in the £. Lighting „ „ 2½d. „ Sewers ,, ,, 2d. ,, The proportion of the General Rate which is required to meet the amount of the School Board Precept represents a rate equal to gd. in the £, which, if deducted from the 2s. in the £ abovementioned, would leave a General Rate of is. 3d. in the £, and a total rate equal to is 7½d. in the £ for all purposes required by the Vestry for its own uses. This would be slightly under the amount of last year's expenditure, but for the sake of affording a comparison, the following Table is given:— 1875 Amounts required by Vestry for its own purposes, equal to a rate of in £• is. 8d. 1876 ditto ditto is. 8d. 1877 ditto ditto is. 8d. 1878 ditto ditto is. 8½d. 1879 ditto ditto is. 8½d. 1880 ditto ditto is. 9d. 1881 ditto ditto is. 8d. 1882 ditto ditto is. 7½d. 1883 ditto ditto is. 5½d. 1884 ditto ditto is. 8d. 1885 ditto ditto is. 7½d. School Board. The School Board, notwithstanding every representation to it to decrease its expenditure, nevertheless continues the same policy, and the Vestry cannot anticipate any diminution in the expenditure until the ratepayers themselves take the matter in hand, and return members to the School Board pledged to stricter economy. The Vestry itself has no power to do anything beyond making representations. The Statement of the various School Board Precepts since the formation of that Board is appended. Consolidated Rate. The Precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works, although still and likely to continue very high, does not exhibit such rapid strides in advancement as those of the School Board. The record of the Metropolitan Board Precepts is also appended. 15 The Vestry has not contracted any farther loan during the Loans, year, but, as before stated, they contemplate doing so. The Vestry feeling that the Clerk and;Surveyor to the Vestry had rendered special and extra services to the Vestry, in relation to the Metropolitan and London, Tilbury and Southend Railway Bill, the London Government Bill, and the Metropolitan Board of Works (Thames Crossings) Bill, which had resulted in a great benefit to the ratepayers at large, referred the matter to a special committee for consideration, and upon the report of that committee, awarded £100 he Clerk to the Vestry and £50 to the Surveyor for such services. Payments to the Clerk and Surveyor. The Annual Accounts of the Vestry were duly audited, found correft, and allowed by the Auditors, and the same are printed and published with this Report.

REPORT AND ACCOUNTS of the SURVEYOR TO THE VESTRY, FOR THE YEAR ENDING MARCH 25TH, 1885. LONDON: PRINTED BY PENNY & HULL, LEMAN STREET, WHITECHAPEL, E. 1885, ANNUAL REPORT of the surveyor to the vestry. To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Gentlemen, In laying before you a summary of the works undertaken under the superintendence of my department, I regret to be obliged again to deplore the condition of the funds at the disposal of the various Committees. The necessary work of re-instating the paved footways in the District has been again postponed ; and only such works as were necessary to prevent accidents have been done. A summary of the work executed by the men in your own employ is as follows:— PAVED FOOTWAYS. New paving squared and laid 12,253 ft- SUP- Old paying taken up and re-laid 51.052 Ditto re-dressed and re-laid 4155 New pitching laid 529 yds. sup Old pitching re-laid 2,465 Old channel re-laid . 3,153 ft- run' New Tees Scoriae paved channels 630 Old curb reiaid 6,247 ., The cost of these works was for labour £615 os. iid., and for material £544 IIs. 4d. The important and much needed work of paving the roadway of Devonshire Street, and of re-paving White Horse Lane, has at length been resolved upon, and when I have again the pleasure of addressing you will, I hope, be completed. Devonshire Street and White Horse Lane. The ordinary work of repairing the McAdamised Roads of the District has been done as usual by your own men ; the result being an expenditure for labour of £1,417 17s. gd. Appended will be found a tabular statement showing the quantity and cost of materials for the past three years. McAdam Roads. During the year some useful work in channel paving has been executed with Tees Scoriae bricks, the quantity being 630 feet run ; and I trust that funds may be forthcoming during the current year to extend this excellent sanitary work. In the present days of steam road rolling it is necessary to have all the channels paved, if for no other reason than to prevent the curb H Tees Scorise Channels. 53 Unpaved Channels and the spread of disease. from being disturbed every time a road is repaired. Channel paving is of much greater importance than this; it prevents small pools of stagnant water which with the best road making will always occur in McAdamised roads, owing to the softness of the subsoil which is caused by the openings for gas and water supplies. In these small pools the low forms of life germinate, and when dry are blown over the neighbourhood. It may be that no disease germ is incubated in these small deposits of decaying matter once in a thousand cases ; but anything which produces objectionable smells at all times affeds the health of the inhabitants, and by so doing may render them susceptible to disease. UNPAVED CARRIAGEWAYS. By the accompanying list will be found the quantity of road material used in maintaining the several roads in the Hamlet which required repair during the year. Gravel yds.

The important sanitary work of removing dust and refuse has been executed by your own horses, carts and men. The quantity collected has been 13044 loads; great difficulty has been experienced in disposing of it, large quantities having been thrown away. A new field has been opened to you for the dispoal of sifted ashes in the Kentish Brick Fields, and this promises to consume about 3000 tons a year. The ashes are taken as back carriage by the barges bringing flints. You have rented your old wharf at Bridge Street for a year for this purpose. Unmarketable Refuse. Its disposal. There is, however, a large quantity 01 the house retuse which is not marketable, and which costs money to remove to places which require filling up. For some years past it has been taken to Beckton Road or sent by rail to sidings on the Great Eastern Railway, which required making up, the Company taking it at a low rate. Both these places are now closed, the West Ham Local Board having (and I think rightly) refused to allow land to be made up with such material, if it be clear that such land is intended for the erection of human habitations. In my opinion this refuse should be burnt. It would not be policy for ' me to enumerate all the things which it contains, and the only safe method of disposing of it is by the means I have indicated. To do this the Vestry must be possessed of a piece of land of considerable dimensions, beyond the metropolis and situated out of the reach of any large town. The refuse might be burned in clamps and the burnt material used to raise the land; or it might be better consummed in a furnace, but this latter course would involve a much larger outlay, both for plant and annual working. Necessity of burning Refuse. Land for this purpose. I have for some years past seen this serious time approaching, and have frequently called your attention to it. I now feel it my duty to tell you that unless you take some bold and decisive step towards providing a means of disposing of your refuse, you will one morning find that it will have to be left in the houses, attended with all the serious results which must arise from such a catastrophe, or you will be in the ignominous position of having to accede to any terms contractors may dictate for receiving it. Present measures. The measures which I am adopting at the present time must be considered as only tentative, and every load you send away is costing you three shillings and sixpence over and above the cartage to the wharf. Decrease in the value of Ashes. In my report to you last year I stated that I feared the brick trade would be worse this year than last, and therefore that the price of ashes could not be maintained. Unfortunately this has proved to be correct, and a neighbouring Vestry is giving sifted ashes away at this moment. 61 DISPOSAL OF DUST. During the year the Vestry have sifted and disposed of dust, and the total amount receivable from this source is £292 9s. 8d. The quantity of dust collected was 13,044 loads, and the sum expended in sifting and loading was ,£422 7s. 4d. The cost of disposing of hard core was £72 us.

The cost last year was 6s. o½d. per horse per day. 62 SCAVENGING.

The public lamps, 911 in number, have been supplied, lighted, painted and cleaned by the Commercial Gas Company, at a cost of £3512 is. od. SEWERS. No important work of sewer construction has been executed during the year. The sewers have been cleansed at a cost of £488 8s. 1 id. for labour, and £292 10s. for water for flushing. Small works of reconstruction and ordinary repairs have been executed at a cost of £"541 12s. 6d. 63. The deodorising chambers for sewer ventilators which I designed eighteen months since continue to work satisfactorily. In no case have any of the new ones, which have been constructed, worked quite so well as the first one made. This had two boxes, one on either side of the ventilating shaft. In this case one side acts as an inlet for pure air, and the other as an outlet for the air purified by the process. For the better information of those members who have not had the opportunity of seeing this simple apparatus, I have had the accompanying diagram prepared. During the year 44 houses have been connected with the sewers of the Hamlet, and 12 new gullies constructed. Two-hundred and twenty-two cubic yards of deposit have been removed from the sewers, and 403 yadrs from the gullies of the District. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. M. KNIGHT, Surveyor.

HENRY EMBLEM, B. DUCKHAM, JOHN MILLER GEORGE WEDLAKE, JAMES J. MUSTO, Auditors. VESTRY OF THE Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. ANNUAL REPORT upon the PUBLIC HEALTH and SANITARY CONDITION OF THE DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR 1884—85, By MATTHEW CORNER, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: PRINTED BY PENNY & HULL, LEMAN STREET, WHITECHAPEL, E. 1885. REPORT. To the Vestry cf the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Twenty-ninth Annual Report upon the Public Health and Sanitary Condition of the Hamlet for the year ending March, 1885. The Report is, upon the whole, highly satisfactory. The number of births was within 82 the same as last year (see Table I.), whereas the deaths were 350 less than the previous year, and this with a continually increasing population, although I have based the statistics upon the same population as before. Reference to this Table will also show the number of births for each quarter, and of each of the sexes, and the same for the deaths. The marriages were 99 less than for the the previous year. Table II. shows deaths from all causes comprised under 48 different heads. There is nothing to note as to the prevalence of any special disease, unless, indeed, we except the high rate of mortality connected with the brain and nervous system generally, both in infant life and old age,—the former too often an indication of generic feebleness, whether from ill-assorted marriages or abnormal feeding and general careless rearing; and the latter from wear and tear in the battle of life, added to the proverbial disregard to those principles of living which are most conducive to a "healthy life, the prolongation of life, and the enjoyment of life,"—these are the great objects which those officially charged with the promotion and maintenance of the public health and well-being should seek to attain, and there is yet a vast and grand field to be explored and developed in these directions; the means are simple enough and easy of application, and the results would be incalculable good to posterity. We have seen, in this district, what may be done in the promotion of vital science through the efforts of the local Health Authority, the death-rate of years back of 28 to 30 per 1,000 populationhas been reduced to 18 to 20 per 1,000; based upon these figures, the saving of human life, and suffering, and of money, all incalculable, such results cannot but be encouraging to continued efforts in the same direction. This latest annual review of the public health of the Hamlet has added another proof of its being a healthy East London Centre, comparing favourably with western and suburban districts, and also of what may be accomplished by the diligent application of the laws for the promotion of public health. 4 INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Table III. shows number of deaths from seven principal infectious diseases, for each quarter, all of which show a considerable comparative reduction, except small pox, which shows a slight increase during the quarters ending June, September, December, proportionate to a general increase in the metropolis; all cases, where necessary and possible, were removed to the hospital, and all houses disinfected. The weekly annual rate of mortality per 1,000 population from infectious diseases was 1.2 compared with 2.9 the previous year. The extent of and mortality from this class of diseases, in a great measure, indicates the sanitary condition of the Hamlet, and especially indicates the greater nursing intelligence and hygienic care bestowed upon patients and homes, which embrace so much in the successful treatment and abolition of infectious diseases. Table IV. shows the number of deaths at various ages. As is invariably the case the greatest number were during the first year, next the second year, after which, the weakest having succumbed to congenital causes and disease, and too often to improper feeding and nursing, there is a gradual decrease to the 15th year, after which an increase occurs decennially up to 70. If a healthy people is deemed essential to a thriving and powerful nation, it is in infancy that these results can be best promoted ; whereas the neglect, cruelty and ignorance of management of young life is universally most culpable and proverbial. 'As usual the greatest mortality occurred during the first year of life, just double the number of those from 1 to 5 years of age, after which "Slaughter of the Innocents" there is a sudden and remarkable reduction of the death-rate up to 20 years, when there commences a gradual increase to 70 years and upwards. The average of the four greatest ages was 95.2 years. Table V. shows Births and Deaths in the five different Wards, Workhouses, and Infirmary. Table VI. shows the number of deaths, and the rate for each of the five Wards, exclusive of Infirmaries. Appended I have also given a corrected estimate of the population of the Hamlet to the present time, which would make the death-rate for the year under review 1.4 per 1,000 population living in the Hamlet, exclusive of deaths in Workhouse Infirmaries. Table VII. Return of Streets and Roads in which cases of infectious diseases have occurred, and which have been investigated, and the necessary instructions given, and notices, where necessary, served. In concluding my Twenty-ninth Annual Report, I have to thank the Vestry, and more especially the No. 3 or Public Health Committee, for their uniform assistance and support in aiding me to so successfully 5 promote the general sanitary condition and consequent public health and material prosperity of the Hamlet. Appended is the Report of your Sanitary Inspector showing the very large amount of practical and valuable work, essential to the comfort and health of the public, so diligently carried out in his department. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, MATTHEW CORNER, M.D. ADULTERATION OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. During the year ending March, 1885, I have received from your Inspector under the Acts, the following samples for analysis, viz.: Flour 9 Bread 9 Cocoa 7 Coffee 7 Milk 10 42 All the above were subjected to careful chemical and microscopic examination, and proved to be genuine, hence the result is highly satisfactory both to the general public and to the Vestry by whom it is represented, and it must be also equally gratifying to the tradesmen of the district as showing that the public need not go farther afield to expend their money in procuring the necessaries of life in the purest condition. Samples of all the articles are preserved at the Vestry, and may be examined in confirmation of correctness of analyses. The general public seem, as hitherto, indifferent to the Act, and do not submit samples for analysis, evidently relying upon the supervision of the local authority. M. CORNER, M.D., Analyst. 6 SANITARY INSPECTOR'S REPORT OF WORKS EXECUTED DURING THE YEAR 1884-5. Houses and premises connected with sewers 44 Old drains abolished 34 Cesspools abolished 8 Closets cleansed and repaired 30 New closets provided 6 Houses cleansed 124 Traps provided to drains 95 New closets provided 8 Drains cleansed and repaired 207 Houses disinfected in consequence of infectious diseases having occurred therein 556 Number of articles of bedding and clothing disinfected 3157 Water supply provided to houses 48 Accumulations of offensive matter removed from different premises 32 Premises from which pigs were removed 12 Defective paving repaired in yards of houses 42 Overcrowding abated 21 Very numerous inspections of premises where offensive works are carried on have been made during the year, and the necessary orders given for the abatement of nuisances. In all cases coming to my knowledge, I have removed and properly disinfected (with the consent of the owners) all bedding and clothing used by persons suffering from infectious diseases. The Slaughter and Cowhouses in the Hamlet have also been frequently visited during the year. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HENRY LESHAW, Sanitary Inspector.
