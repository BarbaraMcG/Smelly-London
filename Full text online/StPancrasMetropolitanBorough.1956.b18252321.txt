July, 1957 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Saint Pancras, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen. I have pleasure in presenting you with my Annual Report for the year 1956. This is the thirteenth report which I have written on the health of the borough of St. Pancras, the 31st report it has been my duty to prepare as a medical officer of health to a local authority. The population in the middle of the year, as estimated by the Registrar General, was 133,100. This compares with a population of 134,500 in the middle of 1955 and means that the number of residents in St. Pancras has fallen by 1,400 during the year The actual census figure for 1951 was 138,377, which is 5,277 more than the present estimated population. Any assessment, however, of the duties and responsibilities for the St. Pancras Borough Council, based on a night time population, is in my opinion fallacious. This fact recently became obvious in preparing the Council's first preliminary scheme for a smoke control area. The area is admittedly small and includes University College, which attracts a number of students from elsewhere. The night time population of the area was found to be 1,626, to which could be added the patients resident in hospital, numbering 750. The total number of persons sleeping in the area was therefore 2,376, In addition to this, however, 7 842 persons entered that particular area to work and 3,700 to study, giving an over -all day population in one small area of nearly 14,000. So gross a difference between day and night time population does not apply uniformly throughout the borough, but it does establish the fact that services and amenities must be provided not only for the 133,100 people who actually sleep in the borough, but for the many thousands in addition whose work and study brings them to St Pancras, a central London borough which is a hive of industry, hospital and university life. 1956 was a rainy year there being recorded 27.28 inches of rain at the Camden Square meteorological station. This was exceeded in 1946 when we had 29.51 inches and in 1951 when there were 32 58 inches. The number of deaths increased from 1,441 to 1,528, and the death rate was 11.5 compared with 10 7 in 1955. On the other hand the births increased from 2,176 to 2,366 and the birth rate from 16 18 to 17.77. The total number of deaths in children under one year was 53 as compared with 50 in the previous year, but in view of the fact that there were 190 more births the infantile mortality rate has been reduced from 22.98 to 22.4 a figure 1 that was bettered only In 1954 when it was 18 Dividing the infantile mortality rate between legitimate and illegitimate children we find that the rate for legitimate children was 24 and for illegitimate children it was 12, This is the first time we have been able to record so surprising a difference Going back to 1939 there have been only two occasions when the infantile mortality rate of illegitimate was lower than that of legitimate children namely in 1941 when the figures were 52 and 44 and in 1949 when the figures were 31 and 30, It is not so long ago since the mortality of illegitimate children was twice that of legitimate children In 1956 we find it was half, This reflects a better understanding of the problems of the unmarried mother, a better appreciation on her part of her responsibility to her child and indeed a tribute to the doctors and the voluntary agencies in the borough who advise and help her. Of the 53 children who died before they attained the age of one year, death occurred in the first day of life in 18 cases 14 between 1 and 7 days, and 6 between the first and fourth weeks It will be seen therefore that the bulk of infantile mortality today is neonatal mortality: occurring during the first four weeks of life. To lower the rate we must look to better understanding of antenatal care and obstetrics Three mothers died of puerperal causes, giving a maternal mortality rate of 1.25 per thousand live and still births Tuberculosis Reference to the graph on page 25 will show a steady diminution in the number of cases of tuberculosis notified each year This graph, however, does not tell the whole story for in fact many of the cases notified were in their early stages and were discovered only as a result of a routine X-ray examination. The bulk of them would therefore have been curable in view of the modern improvements in the treatment of this once much more fatal disease 191 cases were notified during the year. Of these 11 were over 65 and only 14 were individuals under the age of 20 years, the bulk being in the age period 25 to 35 years This group accounted for 66 notifications. Of the 191 primary notifications 58 were in persons over 45 years of age It will be seen therefore that tuberculosis is no longer a disease of young people, and the large proportion of notifications is of individuals about or over middle age. In some cases the condition is already well established and chronic when notified and it is sometimes very difficult to render such patients free from infection. It is possible that the major source of infective tuberculosis in the country today is from this older age group of chronic infectious cases. I have no record of the past history of each individual case notified but have reason to think that an undue proportion of the new notifications is in people who have come to England from abroad. 28 individuals died of tuberculosis during 1956 Of these five were over 75 years of age and four between 65 and 74 There were no deaths in persons under 24 and only two in the age group 25 to 34. This is due to the effects of better treatment. The 28 deaths from tuberculosis represents the smallest number recorded in the borough from this disease and compares with 312 in 1920, when admittedly the resident population at 228,980 was 95 880 more than in 1956, ii Mass Radiography The mass radiography unit of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board held twelve sessions for industrial firms and the general public in the St. Pancras area during 1956 as follows:- Situation of Unit Date Number examined Male Female Total Royal Veterinary College 30th January 227 26 253 University College 31st January 1st February 1, 800 794 2,594 Stucley Place 5th March 3 109 112 Carreras Ltd. 13th March 694 818 1,512 Howland Street 4th-5th April 228 207 435 Burton Place 10th April 53 - 53 Charlotte Street 23rd April 22 73 95 University College 4 th May 204 68 272 Pitzroy Square 24th September 143 145 288 St. Pancras Station 25th September 255 148 403 St. Pancras Station 31st October 332 75 407 Euston Station lst-7th November 1,402 393 1,795 5,363 2,856 8,219 Of those examined, active tuberculosis was found in 9 cases of whom 8 were males and 1 female In 13 further cases (12 males and one female) occasional supervision was found to be required These 22 cases were contained in age groups as follows- Age group Active pulmonary tuberculosis Occasional supervision Male Female Male Female 14-19 1 - - - 20-24 1 1 1 - 25-34 2 - 1 1 35 44 2 - 2 * 45-54 1 - 4 - 55-64 1 - 4 - 65 plus - - - - Totals 8 1 12 1 The ready co-operation of no less than thirty firms and undertakings, who afforded their employees the opportunity to take advantage of the mass X-ray facilities is acknowledged and appreciated Clearly it is most probable that many of the 8,219 persons examined in Saint Pancras were non-residents of the Borough, On the other hand, many St. Pancras residents were probably X rayed at their place of business in adjoining boroughs iii where the work of the mass radiography unit was also at the service of the public during the year. Infectious disease There were five cases of confirmed acute poliomyelitis (2 paralytic and 3 non-paralytic) as compared with 40 (16 paralytic and 24 nonparalytic) in the previous year. Not one case of diphtheria was notified. 827 notifications of measles were received compared with 1,618 in the previous year. Not one single child has died of measles since 1951 when one death was recorded. It is interesting to note that in 1928 there were 127 deaths recorded as due to measles, This may reflect a diminished virulence of the disease itself, but I think credit must be given to better parental care and understanding of the disease, and expert treatment by the general practitioners of the borough. There were 174 notifications of whooping cough compared with 113 in 1955. Smoke The nuisance from smoke at the Camden Motive Power Depot has continued during the year, and I am unable to report that there has been any substantial improvement I think it is true to say that repeated approach has been made to every politician or government department who might help in any way whatsoever, and this not only by the Council but by the Chalk Farm Tenants' and Residents' Association. No one has attempted to deny that a nuisance exists, and a serious nuisance at that. It has been agreed that the nuisance will be overcome when the railway lines are electrified or alternatively when present steam engines are replaced by diesel-electric engines. It is very hard however, to ask those who suffer from this nuisance to accept it for a period of another 10 years. Alternative suggestions have been made, one for enclosing the depot., extracting smoke and discharging it from a tail chimney How practical this would be I do not know.It would certainly be expensive if expense is to be measured in terms of money, but in any case we have been told that there could be no justification for this outlay in view of the fact that the works would become obsolete after electrification. I think one should consider very carefully how the conditions of the people living in proximity to the depot compare from a health point of view with those applicants who are asking the Council to re house them, or those who are living in areas which are being represented in the slum clearance programme. I have recently been asked to answer this very question. I would say that undoubtedly many of those on the Council s waiting list are housed in conditions which are more injurious to health than the conditions of residents in Gloucester Avenue, and here I refer to families living in one room, and sometimes one underground room On the other hand I think the conditions are worse in Gloucester Avenue than they are in some of our slum clearance areas, and here I am speaking, not of lack of amenities,, but of atmospheric pollution and the inconvenience of iv living in premises that are so frequently polluted with smoke and particles from anything up to 28 engines under steam for many hours. It was suggested at one time that the area should be included as a slum clearance area. This however, is not possible, for an area can only be represented as a slum clearance area if the houses in the area are unfit for human habitation or are by reason of their bad arrangements or the narrowness or bad arrangement of the streets, injurious to the health of the inhabitants. To be unfit for human habitation a house must be so far defective in one or more of the undermentioned matters as not to be reasonably suitable for occupation in that condition;- (a) Repair (b) Stability (c) Freedom from damp (d) Natural lighting (e) Ventilation (f) Water supply (g) Drainage and sanitary conveniences (h) Facilities for storage, preparation and cooking of food and for the disposal of waste water, We are advised, therefore that on legal grounds one could not represent the Gloucester Avenue area as a slum clearance area On the other hand I think that consideration should be given to the possibility of re-housing the people in the area, even if it means some delay in the slum clearance programme: and in the end this may prove the most practical method of dealing with one of the most long lasting and serious nuisances in the borough Special Reports During the last few years various duties have fallen upon the Public Health Department and I am submitting special reports on some of these - Fireguards Protection of the public against the dangers inherent in unguarded electric, gas and paraffin fires is afforded by the Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act. 1952 This Act makes it an offence for any person to sell expose for sale or let under a hire purchase agreement any relevant domestic heating appliance which is not fitted with a guard of the required standard The Secretary of State is authorised to make regulations defining standards and tests in respect of new and second hand gas electric and oil heaters On the 24th March 1953 the Home Secratary made the appropriate regulations and these became operative on the 1st October of that year Fires manufactured before that date are exempt from the new requirements for a period of one year, but after 1st October 1954 all fires offered for sale, of whatever age, have to comply. Every heating appliance (other than a totally enclosed oil convector heater) must be fitted with a guard securely fixed to the heater and of v sufficient strength and method of construction to comply with certain requirements relative to the spacing of the protective wires, smouldering and ignition capacity, and strength of the guard itself. In the middle of 1954 a circular letter was sent to all known vendors of fires in the borough, of which there are about 48, informing them of the requirements of the regulations. The Council's Public Health Inspectors have kept a constant watch on shop windows to detect any fires displayed without guards, and inspections of stock have been made. There has been little difficulty in connection with the sale of new fires, for they are now provided with a fixed guard by the manufacturers. We do experience some difficulty in connection with the provision of guards for second-hand fires, for the cost of providing and fixing the guard is out of proportion to the sum that can be obtained for the completed article. When dealing with the attitude of the public it is interesting to note that one second-hand dealer maintained that his customers became so guard-conscious that he had been asked to supply guards to customers to whom he had sold fires before the regulations came into force. On the other hand, some individuals have complained that the guard makes it somewhat difficult to light a fire. I doubt if this is a complaint that could be reasonably justified. Pet Animals Act, 1951 This Act came into operation on 1st April, 1952, and makes provision, inter alia for ensuring that animals exposed for sale shall be suitably accommodated supplied with sufficient food and drink, and protected against the spread of infection and danger from fire, Certain forms of street trading and sale to persons under twelve years of age are prohibited. During 1956 seven licences to keep a pet shop were granted six of the shops deal mainly with cage birds and cold water and tropical fish. The other shop carries on an extensive business, and holds a large and varied stock. This shop is inspected monthly, and the smaller shops annually. Hairdressers and Barbers The Borough Council on 22nd June, 1955, made byelaws under the provisions of Section 18(4) of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954, for the control of hairdressers' and barbers" establishments and persons engaged in the work thereof. The byelaws provide for the cleanliness and maintenance of floors, walls, ceilings, chairs, shelves, cabinets, wash-basins, combs, brushes and instruments; for the cleanliness and proper use of towels, wraps, vi gowns and overalls for the use of proper materials for chair coverings, neck wool and hair nets for proper storage and removal of hair clippings: for satisfactory water supply, and for the cleanliness of those engaged in the business in regard to both themselves and their clothing There are 131 establishments registered in the Borough and of these 32 are south of a line drawn along Euston Road and 99 north of this line They comprise - 76 for gentlemen only, 38 for ladies only and 17 for both ladies and gentlemen Persons engaged in these establishments including proprietors total 318 (178 male 140 female) operating at 476 chairs or cubicles,. The number of washbasins in use is 528,, to which, with few exceptions there is a suitable and sufficient supply of hot water, mainly from gas or electric water heaters, though in some cases from domestic hot water boilers. The premises are visited regularly and during the course of the year the following contraventions of the Act and byelaws were discovered:- Certificate of Registration and/or copy of byelaws 49 not displayed Lack of a suitable covered receptacle for hair 16 clippings etc Inadequate supply of hot water: 5 Shop and/or fittings not in cleanly condition 6 Dirty and defective floor covering 1 Untrapped waste pipes to washbasins 1 Protective clothing not reasonably clean 1 Instruments not in satisfactory condition 4 Overalls not reasonably clean 3 Inadequate supply of neck cloths 1 Walls and ceilings in need of cleansing 7 Operatives hands not in clean condition 1 Defective washbasins 1 Dirty washbasins 1 Broken shelves 1 In every instance the proprietors attention was drawn to these contraventions and the requisite work was carried out or put in hand though two of the shops where conditions were generally unsatisfactory were later found to have discontinued business It is not always recognised among hairdressers and barbers that registration with the Local Authority is necessary before commencing business- A recent survey reveaied 14 not registered and four where the business had changed hands. vii By and large the hairdressers and barbers in the Borough carry out their business in a satisfactory and hygienic manner. Whilst this may be due to the fact that the public tends to show discrimination and will cease to go to a hairdresser" s shop where the conditions are patently bad, I think it only right to say that the proprietors them selves have shown a spirit of understanding and co-operation to which I should like to pay tribute The Public Health Department has continued its practise of previous years of visiting all persons in the borough known to the Department as being blind. The total number we have visited is 46, but I have reason to believe that this represents less than a quarter of those on the register of the London County Council. This register is not available to the department and it is only in the event of cases coming to our notice from other sources that we are able to visit. The object of the inspection by the Public Health Inspector is twofold. In the first place he looks for defects that might not be apparent to the blind person and he secures their remedy. In the second place he is an additional visitor who is welcomed as a friend. Those we visited were in the following age groups:- The individual under 15 was at school Of the remainder, 12 were working, 2 at home and 10 elsewhere. Of the six totally blind persons who were employed, one was working at home on basket making and the other on machine knitting The other four worked at the National Institute for the Blind. Of those who were not completely blind, one was a piano tuner one employed in a cafe and the remainder attended the National Institute for the Blind or the London County Council Institute, 60 visits were made during the year,, and in every case the visit was welcomed. That these visits are necessary is illustrated by the fact that it was necessary to serve a sanitary notice in seven cases; in one case a separate water supply was provided to a partially blind person living alone. Prior to the provision of this water supply he had drawn water from a tap on the staircase and disposed of the waste water down the ground floor water closet. He lived on the first floor. In other cases a notice was served for dampness, disinfestation of verminous rooms the repair of a dangerous handrail and floor,, and the redecoration of rooms. Blind persons 0-15 16-30 31-45 46-65 Over 65 1 3 2 14 26 viii Slum Clearance Under the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, the Metropolitan Borough Councils and the London County Council were required to submit to the Minister of Housing and Local Government within a year of the passing of the Act a joint programme for dealing with unfit property in each borough In accordance with the above requirement, the Borough Council submitted to the London County Council twenty-three areas, comprising 706 houses, and after negotiation and a conference at County Hall it was agreed that fifteen areas comprising 349 houses should be represented during the five years 1955-60, and that the work should be divided as follows - To be dealt with by the Borough Council:- Area No. of houses Bridgeway Street, etc. 39 Bayham Place 23 Ferdinand Street, etc. 29 Model Buildings 15 Curnock Street 28 Wicklow Street 12 Prowse Place 3 Falkland Place 23 Total 172 To be dealt with by the London County Council:- Area No. of houses Aldenham Street 5 Baynes Street, etc. 76 Tovey Place 14 Seaton Place, etc. 27 Raglan Street, etc. 16 King's Terrace 26 Janestown Road 13 Total 177 At the time of writing this report I have represented to the Borough Council the following areas- Area No. of houses Date of Representation Bridgeway street, etc. 39 15, 2,56 Bayham Place 23 19, 9, 56 Ferdinand Street, etc. 29 19, 9,56 Model Buildings 15 5, 6,57 Total 106 A local enquiry was held in respect of the Bridgeway Street, etc., Area on 20th December, 1956 and on 26th April, 1957, the Minister confirmed the Order, omitting therefrom The Neptune" Public House. Local enquiries in respect of the Bayham Place and Ferdinand Street Areas were held on 16th July, 1957. The London County Council have intimated that they are prepared to agree that the Borough Council should deal with the Jamestown Road Area instead of ix themselves as originally arranged and that the houses in Arlington Road, suggested in the original programme and which by agreement with the London County Council were deferred might be included. It will be seen that of the eight areas, comprising 172 houses,, which constitute the Borough Council s slum clearance programme for the five year period ending 1960 four areas have been dealt with, and that these four areas comprise 106 houses The London County Council have already dealt with the small Aldenham Street Area I am informed that it is hoped to represent the Baynes Street, etc and Tovey Place Areas in the middle of 1957, and that the Seaton Place, etc, and Raglan Street/Crown Place Areas will be dealt with later in the five year period. Smoking and Cancer In view of the report of the Medical Research Council on smoking and cancer of the lung, Dr. Tracy and I feel that we are bound to make some comment on this subject. From all we have read concerning the association of smoking and lung cancer we are satisfied that there is an association which is cause and effect. In other words a heavy smoker, particularly of cigarettes, is more liable to contract cancer of the respiratory tract than the non smoker We do not say that smoking is the only cause of cancer of the lung but it is definitely one of the causes. Obviously in view of the fact that smoking has become a national habit it is essential that research should be undertaken to produce a cigarette that does not influence the growth of cancer. In the meanwhile our advice is this Young people should be discouraged from commencing to smoke, It must be remembered that the older schoolboy and the young adolescent possesses no craving to smoke. He smokes because he sees other boys and girls of his own age doing so, and primarily because he wants to be grown up and one of the crowd Parents should explain to their children that really and truly smoking does not make a girl or boy more grown up and they should explain the risks inherent in smoking stating the case plainly There is little we can say to the confirmed smoker The public already know the situation. It would appear that to those who can afford it a cigar is safer than cigarettes and those who cannot afford the luxury of a cigar, pipe smoking is a lesser risk than cigarette smoking. The choice rests with the individual. Some persons can give up smoking with relative ease and all that is required is the desire to do so In other cases giving up smoking appears to be almost an impossibility and even cutting down the number of cigarettes during the day is a matter of extreme difficulty. The question arises as to whether the desire to smoke is due to the nicotine in the tobacco or whether it is purely and simply a question of habit. We ourselves do not believe that the smoker is a drug addict - by which we mean there is no similarity between the smoker and the patient who is taking either morphia or alcohol. It is a fact that people can stop smoking without showing any of x those crises which are found when the opium addict or the alcoholic is deprived of his drug. We would quote as an example the fact that people who are sent to prison are unable to smoke except to a very limited degree They nevertheless are able to accept the situation without a serious emotional crisis Furthermore there are persons who throughout the whole of their lives, for religious reasons have succeeded in refraining from smoking either on a Saturday or a Sunday, and there are others who cease smoking during the whole of Lent. We doubt if the chronic alcoholic or morphia addict could achieve this. What, then, is the compulsion to smoke? It is the compulsion of a long established habit, and one that is encouraged by poster, advertisement, by fashion and the herd instinct We therefore consider that if a person could be placed in an environment where he was not subjected to the compulsion of smoking he might smoke less Smoking might well be prohibited in buses trams and trains in theatres and in cinemas to the benefit not only of the smoker but of the non-smoker as well We believe that the smoker could adjust him or herself without too much hardship to refraining from smoking in these surroundings for the desire to smoke is very often brought about by environmental factors: the meeting of friends the offer of a cigarette annoyance excitement and the like We ourselves are in a neutral position One of us gave up smoking 20 years ago for reasons other than the fear of cancer and the other is a moderate smoker. We therefore trust that we have been able to give a combined unbiased opinion. S P A C A. The St Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged has now become an integral part of the public health and social amenities of the Borough of St Pancras and once again I make no apology for bringing it within the scope of my annual report S, P AC. A., the name by which it is now so well known has continued its work regularly throughout ^he year increasing it in those directions where it has been found to be weak At the time of writing this report there are four whole time nurses engaged in the routine care of the aged It had been the hope of the Association that the nurses wouia be abxfc to spend most of their time In visiting old people in health advising them and guiding them in order that they might avoid those pitfalls of the latter end of life which tend to make life difficult and uncomfortable. To some extent we are succeeding in this On the other hand the St Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged is now so well known to general practitioners almoners and clergy working in the borough not to mention Councillors County Councillors and Members of Parliament that we receive a regular stream of requests that we visit old people in difficulty in order to advise them As a result much of the time of the nurses is devoted to these special cases, xi I do not think I can repeat too often that one's aim in caring for old people is to keep them in their own homes under healthy and happy conditions. To achieve this there are various services which I think are essential. Of these I consider that the most important is the Home Help Service. The time comes to all old people when they are unable to carry out the heavy work of their own homes to keep their rooms clean and free from nuisance, and the provision of a home help at this time is of paramount importance. The second most important factor is to secure that the old person is provided with adequate meals in order that his nutrition may be safeguarded. The St, Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged provides meals in their homes or meals in restaurants for those people who by reason of age or infirmity or lack of proper amenities cannot provide meals for themselves 9,889 meals were provided to old people in their own homes, and 8,060 meals to others who were unable to provide a meal in their own home but could nevertheless attend at a local restaurant. The third factor which many old people require is a certain amount of nursing and this is provided via the District Nursing Associations in the borough, to whom I would like to express my most sincere gratitude. A clean home, adequate food and a modicum of nursing - these are the three main essentials of the aged. I am reminded, however, that man cannot live on bread alone and it is essential to secure mental and physical comfort. Physical comfort is provided through our chiropody clinics and no less than 5,078 attendances were made during the year. It is difficult to over-estimate the comfort which this brings to those who attend Insofar as mental welfare is concerned, there are many clubs for old people in the borough, and again I would find it hard to exaggerate the benefit which they confer on those old people who belong to them S P.A C A has continued to send old people away for a fortnight s holiday and 129 individuals benefited from this scheme during 1956 The letters I have received testify to the satisfactory arrangements which have been made- Old age can be a very lonely time and few people realise what a difference the provision of a wireless set can make to old persons living alone There are now 106 wireless sets on loan to old people in the borough We seldom get letters of thanks for the provision of a wireless set. On the other hand when, having provided itP the set goes wrong we get letters immediately begging us with all speed to repair it the old person being lost without the company and the interest with which his wireless provides him It is a companion all the week round- Through the visits of our nurses we are able to keep under regular observation some two or three thousand old persons In addition to this all those who attend at our chiropody clinics are seen either by Dr. Tracy or one of the nurses At the*medical and nurses' clinics no less than 4.422 attendances were made. Domiciliary visiting by the nurses amounted to 5 662 but in addition to this a large number of visits were made by voluntary visitors, to whose regular work I would like to pay tribute. In particular I would mention the British Red Cross Society which arranges for a large number of old people to be visited regularly through the services of its members. xii It is interesting to note that towards the total cost of the administration of the St, Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged Â£680 was raised as a result of voluntary contributions Poliomyelitis At the time of writing this report I have just returned from the fourth International Poliomyelitis Conference held in Geneva and I feel sure that you would like me to give you some indication of the present position concerning the prevention of the disease It is now some three years since Dr. Jonas Salk of Pittsburg America,, produced a vaccine against poliomyelitis which could be manufactured in mass quantities In America no less than 140 million doses of this vaccine have been injected and there is evidence that it reduces materially the risks of contracting paralytic poliomyelitis. Similar vaccines are being used in various other countries. I have had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Salk in Rome, in Pittsburg and in Geneva, and I am sure that he would like me to state that the credit for the production of the vaccine lies with no one individual but in the work of a highly skilled team A similar vaccine is being manufactured in England. It has been given to about 140,000 children, and there is evidence once again that it materially reduces the risk of contracting paralytic poliomyelitis. The vaccine is similar to Salk vaccine except that one of the three types of virus used is less virulent than that used by Dr Salk. I am often asked how long it will be before vaccine will be available to the large bulk of persons in England to whom protection may rightly be afforded. My information is that about 500 000 doses are being manufactured monthly enough to immunise 250 000 children a month or 3 million a year It is possible that when other firms manufacture the vaccine this production may be increased On the other hand strict precautions have to be taken and even this figure may not be achieved I have also been asked whether the American and the English vaccines are safe and to what extent,they are efficacious. I think that both vaccines are safe and efficacious. As regards the American vaccine the injection of 140 million doses without untoward event is in itself adequate proof of safety and strict precautions are taken in America to ensure that the production of the vaccine continues under the most careful and strict control. In England the vaccine prepared has shown itself to be equally safe and the strictest control measures are adopted. The general impression at the Conference was that the vaccine achieved a 75 per cent efficiency: that is that it reduced the incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis to about one quarter of what it otherwise might be. Generally I felt that there was considerable variation and that in some cases it might be higher and in others lower, depending on various environmental factors, and the type of virus causing the epidemic. I have also been asked in view of the time which is bound to elapse before sufficient British vaccine will be available for all those requiring it, whether xiii it is possible to obtain the American vaccine Originally,, correspondence with the Ministry of Health indicated that individuals might obtain vaccine from America,provided the application was supported by a medical practitioner, and that;'dollars would be made available for the purchase of small quantities. I now understand that this is not so, but that it can be obtained only if it is sent as an unsolicited gift. These are the facts as I understand them at present. The vaccines against poliomyelitis that are being used in England, the United States and elsewhere are made of killed virus and are injected. Two workers in America, however Drs, Sabin and Koprowsky., have been working for many years on a live attenuated vaccine which can be given by mouth. They hold that such a vaccine would give a more lasting immunity than that achieved by a dead vaccine. It is a fact that we do not know yet how long the protection afforded by the Salk vaccine will last, though we have reason to hope that it will be some years. For that matter we do not know how long the immunity derived from a live vaccine would continue, except that it is believed that the immunity so obtained is similar to the natural immunity which is derived by the ordinary individual or by those who have suffered from one attack of the disease. For an attenuated vaccine to be successful and safe, one must be sure that the live virus will not recover its virulence., and in this there seems to be an element of doubt. Further experimental work will be carried out on these vaccines. Conclusion The Committee will realise that the preparation of this Annual Report is not the sole effort of the Medical Officer of Health I am indebted, in particular, to Mr. C.W. Smith who is responsible for preparing the background upon which the report is presented This is a task which is continuous throughout the year, and involves compilation of all figures and statistical tables and graphs I have also received very considerable help from Dr S. Tracy, Deputy Medical Officer of Health and Mr E.W Winchester Chief Public Health Inspector - indeed, all members of the staff are involved I would like to mention in particular Mr D H, Smith, Mr, HP Price, Mr J Marginson and Mr. B V Cryer in connection with the reports on fireguards, the Pet Animals Act hairdressers and blind persons respectively No Medical Officer of Health works in isolation. He is dependent for any success he may achieve on the trust and confidence which is placed in him by the members of the Council, and once again it is my priviiage to thank the Council, and in particular the members of the Public Health Committee, for the encouragement and courtesy I have always received. To my colleagues in charge of the other Departments of the Council I would like to express my thanks for making St. Pancras so happy a place in which to work, I beg to remain.

LAND CHARGES ACT, 1925 It is the practice of solicitors to enquire from the Town Hall as to certain particulars regarding property which they are purchasing on behalf of their clients. The information is provided by the Town Clerk, and is regulated by the Land Charges Act, 1925. This involves certain information which is required from the Public Health Department and is as follows:- 1. Have any notices been served by the Public Health Department in respect of the above named premises which remain uncomplied with? If so please give particulars including number and date of Intimation and Statutory Notice. 2. (a) Is the property drained separately into the main sewer? (b) If not are the premises drained by an approved combined operation with any other premises. 3. (a) Have any notices been served under the Housing Act 1936 in respect of the property? (b) Is the property included in any clearance area? 4. Any additional enquiry. During the course of the year the Public Health Department provided 1,259 reports answering the enquiries set out above. 35 REHOUSING AND OVERCROWDING Requests were received from the London County Council during 1956 for investigations to be made of alleged statutory overcrowding in respect of 18 applications for rehousing. Reports forwarded in reply confirmed overcrowding in 14 cases. During the early part of 1956 the Council resolved that rehousing priority should be determined entirely on a basis of need, and it was resolved to adopt a points scheme as follows:- General (i) The basis will be only that of need. (ii) In the event of two or more cases attracting the same number of points, then time on the waiting list will be the determining factor in the order of housing, (iii) No points will be awarded for service in H,M. Forces or "bombed out'?. (iv) Lettings from the waiting list will be made by a Sub-Committee of the main Committee, but subject to the latter's approval. (v) One point will be awarded for each year on the waiting list. (Subject to (ii) above.) Points qualifications other than for time Health - Points to a maximum of 10 to be awarded at the discretion of the Medical Officer of Health. Condition of property - Maximum of 10 points. Living condition - Maximum of 15 points to be awarded as follows:- 5 points for shared or inadequate kitchen facilities 5 points for shared lavatory 5 points for shared bath or no bath Room deficiency - 10 points for each room deficiency on the basis that there is required a separate living room and a bedroom for each two members of the family, allowance being made for segregation of sexes. It will be seen that insofar as the officials are concerned the maximum number of points that can be awarded are determined by the scheme. No points scheme however can be entirely fair and equitable and in order to meet this situation the Lettings Sub- Committee is empowered to allocate points entirely at its discretion. During the course of the year 2 114 applications were investigated by the staff of the Public Health Department following a visit by a Public Health Inspector. Medical points were awarded either by me or Dr. Tracy: the Deputy Medical Officer of Health. 36 PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT, 1933 The following applications were received during 1956 for retention.or entry in the Council:s.list of persons entitled to sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List:- Retentions 126 New entries 7 PET ANIMALS ACT 1951 This Act has been in force since the 1st April, 1952, and requires that no person shall keep a pet shop unless licensed by a local authority. Seven licences were in force during 1956 and no contraventions were reported, HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS By-laws made by the St. Pancras Borough Council pursuant to section 18(4) of the London County Council (General Powers) Act 1954 render it illegal for any person to carry on the business of Hairdresser or Barber in the Borough unless he and the premises are registered by the Borough Council, The by-laws also govern the cleanliness of the premises, instruments, towels materials and equipment used as well as that of the persons employed and their clothing. They also require an adequate fresh water supply and washing facilities. At the end of the year under review 130 persons and premises were registered. 37 WATER The water supply in the borough is provided by the Metropolitan Water Board, as the statutory authority for London, and has been satisfactory in quality and quantity. WELL WATER There are five wells in use in the borough, four being on factory premises and one at the Council's swimming baths at Prince of Wales Road. In addition, certain wells are situated outside the borough are a source of supply to various points on the railway system centred on Euston Station. Eight samples of water were taken during the year and submitted for chemical and bacteriological examination. All proved satisfactory. SWIMMING BATHS AND PONDS There are three swimming baths in the borough Parliament Hill Lido (L.C.C.), Prince of Wales Road (Borough Council), and one private. Seven samples of water were taken during the year There are also two swimming ponds one ladies" and one mens' at Parliament Hill. Six samples were taken- All samples proved satisfactory after chemical and bacteriological examination.. 38 PREVENTION OP DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Details of the work carried out during the year in respect of rats and mice are given in the following table., with figures for 1955 in brackets:- Premises Total Private Business Complaints received 800 (965) 117 (142) 917 (1,107) Investigations made 1,718 (2,333) 435 (383) 2,153 (2,716) Infestations found ( Rats 438 (630) 75 (103) 513 (733) ( Mice 319 (268) 42 (25) 361 (293) Treatments ( Rats 616 (626) 106 (80) 722 (706) ( Mice 290 (303) 57 (29) 347 (332) Advice only 1 (7) 4 (3) 5 (10) The staff employed on this work consists of one rodent officer and five operatives.

In one case it was found necessary to obtain a Magistrate's Order under the Act. The source of information and action taken are sh0own in the following table:- Reported by No. of cas0es ACTION TAKEN Voluntarily removed to hospital or institution Kept under observation at home together with the provision of various types of help Deceased Chiropody clinic 2 2 - - Health officers 3 1 2 - Neighbour 1 - 1 - 6 3 3 - The remaining case (No.212) was one in respect of which it was found necessary to obtain a Magistrate s Order under the National Assistance Acts. The case was first brought to the notice of the Council in October, 1955. Mrs. J. aged 84, was not without financial means and owned the house in which she lived. The services of a home help were afforded throughout, together with the provision of dinners, in an effort to enable the woman to remain in her own homeâ€ž Unfortunately conditions deteriorated Mrs, J refused to wear warm clothing or to eat adequate food and wandered into the street not properly clothed. Her removal to an institution therefore became necessary but she refused to allow arrangements to be made. The provisions of the Acts were invoked and Mrs. J was removed to Luxborough Lodge on the 9th October 1956, I have visited her there on two occasions. She remains disorientated and unfit to look after herself. Section 50 - Burials During the year 1956 the department carried out 80 burials at a gross cost of Â£824. 8s. 7d which represents an average of Â£10. 6s. 1d per burial. Â£772. 5s. 9d was recovered from the following sources:- Â£ s. d Hospitals 320. 0. 7 Death grants 166. 6. 1 Assurance Companies 89.7. 1 Private persons 62. 9.11 Employers 35.18. 2 Ministry of National Insurance 26. 3. 7 National Assistance Board 3.14. 5 Post Office Savings 6. 1 Treasury Solicitor 9.19. 0 Coroner's Officers 38. 9.10 Nigerian Government 11. 1. 0 Sale of Effects 8. 10. 0 40 Pull recovery of costs together with administrative charges was secured in sixty-five cases,, and varying amounts in six others. In nine cases nothing was recovered.. The net cost to the Council was thus Â£52,, 2s.l0d an average of 13s. per burial. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS During the course of the year Dr. Tracy and I carry out a number of examinations to determine whether new entrants to the Council s service are fit for superannuation purposes- We also examine personnel for the London Electricity Board the Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee and the Valuation Panel, During the year I have been asked on two occasions to examine persons living in the neighbourhood who were accepting positions in Borough Councils elsewhere. I have carried out these examinations for it is the usual practice for Councils to help each other in this way on a reciprocal basis. The number of special examinations is stated as 8 but I would inform the Council that a vast amount of correspondence has to be carried out with private doctors and with hospitals to ascertain the fitness of members of the staff who have been off duty for some while. The conditions we have to deal with cover a wide range of disease including cases of cancer tuberculosis, diseases of the eye, surgical and medical conditions The Committee will realise that information we receive is of course entirely confidential and we can only give to the Committee medical details provided we have the authority of the person concerned. By and large we have to confine ourselves to stating whether in our opinion the person is rightly off duty, when he is likely to return and the extent to which in future he will be able to carry out his duties The following table summarises the work that has been carried out during the year:- NEW ENTRANTS Fit 98 Unfit 5 Total 103 Special Examinations Fit to resume work 3 Unfit for work 5 Total 8 The Total of 111 is made up as follows:- Borough Council staff 69 Electricity Board staff 37 S.P.A.C.A 1 Valuation Panel 2 Examination for Cornwall 1 Examination for York 1 Total 111 41 SECTION 5 Factories The provisions of the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948 are administered by H.M. Inspector of Factories of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, in conjunction with the local sanitary authority. Close co-operation is maintained between the two, and defaults found in the course of visits to factories are notified between one and the other according to the body responsible for remedial measures. The principal duties of the sanitary authority are the enforcement of Sections 1,2,3,4,6 and 7 of the Factories Act, 1937 insofar as non-power factories are concerned, and Section 7 only in respect of power factories. The requirements of these sections may be summarised as follows-- Section 1 Every factory to be kept clean , and free from any effluvia arising from any drain, sanitary convenience or nuisance, and lays down the frequency with which cleansing must be undertaken. Section 2 A factory shall not be so overcrowded as to cause risk of injury to health of the persons employed therein. Section 3 Effective provision to be made for securing and maintaining a reasonable temperature in each work-room. Section 4 Effective and suitable provision for securing and maintaining adequate ventilation of each work-room, and for rendering harmless all fumes, dust and other impurities generated in the course of any work. Section 6 Effective drainage of floors where wet processes are carried on. Section 7 Provision of sufficient and suitable sanitary conveniences properly lighted, with separate accommodation for the sexes. 42 Particulars of inspections and other work carried out by the Factory Inspectors during 1956 are given in the following table:- Number of visits:- Factories (with mechanical power) 2,706 Factories (without mechanical power) 1,159 Bakehouses 236 Restaurants 1,017 Outworkers' premises 1,762 Rag Flock Act 20 Scabies and vermin cases 126 Smoke observations 259 Water sampling 27 Public Health Annexe 174 Other visits 55 Total 7,541 Intimation Notices served relating to Statutes under which served Factories Act, 1937 >ublic Health (London) Act, 1936 Food and Drugs Act, 1938 Factories (with mechanical power) 191 30 - Factories (withont mechanical power) 12 - - Bakehouses _ - 40 Restaurants and canteens - - 118 Totals 203 30 158 Statutory notices served 23 3 6 43 The following particulars are furnished in accordance with section 128(3) of the 1937 Act, with respect to matters under Part I and Part VIII:â€“ Part 1 of the Act 1.

Section 110 requires the occupier of every factory and every contractor employed by him to send to the Borough Council during the months of February and August in each year, lists showing the names and addresses of all outworkers employed by him outside the factory, and the places where they are employed. Failure to comply with this requirement renders the occupier liable to a fine not exceeding Â£10. The Council is required to forward the name and address of any outworker in this list whose address is not in St. Pancras to the local authority concerned. Section 111 applies to premises where work is carried on which, in the Council's opinion, is injurious or dangerous to the health of the persons employed therein and in such cases the Council is empowered to give notice of the circumstances, in writing, to the occupier of the factory. If, after the expiration of ten days, the occupier continues to give out work to those premises, he is guilty of an offence. A Schedule to the Act states that if the occupier of a factory knowingly allows a woman or girl to be employed therein within four weeks after she has given birth to a child, he shall be liable to a fine. If the occupier of a factory or his contractor allows wearing apparel to be made, cleaned or repaired in any place where an inmate is suffering from scarlet fever or smallpox, and cannot prove that he was unaware of the existence of the disease, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding Â£10. The Council has power to forbid work being given out to premises where an inmate is suffering from an infectious disease, and an occupier or contractor upon whom such an order has been served shall be liable to a fine not exceeding Â£10 if he contravenes such order. The industries contained in the list of trades in connection with outworkers are as follows:- (1) Making, cleaning, washing, altering, ornamenting, finishing and repairing of wearing apparel; (2) Making up, ornamenting finishing and repairing of table linen, bed linen, or other household linen (including in the term linen, articles of cotton or cotton and linen mixtures); (3) Making, ornamenting, mending, and finishing of lace and of lace curtains and nets; (4) Making of curtains and furniture hangings; (5) Cabinet and furniture making and upholstery work; (6) Making of Electro plate; (7) Making of files; 45 (8) Manufacture of brass and of any articles or parts of articles of brass (including in the term brass any alloy or compound of copper with zinc or tin; (9) Fur-pulling; (10) Making of iron and steel cables and chains; (11) Making of iron and steel anchors and grapnels; (12) Making of cart gear, including swivels, rings, loops, gearbuckles, mullin bits, hooks, and attachments of all kinds; (13) Making of locks, latches, and keys. (14) Making or repairing of umbrellas, sunshades, parasols, or parts thereof; (15) Making of artificial flowers; (16) Making of nets other than wire nets; (17) Making of tents; (18) Making or repairing of sacks; (19) Covering of raquet or tennis balls; (20) Making of paper bags; (21) Making of boxes or other receptacles or parts thereof made wholly or partially of paper, card-board, chip, or similar material; (22) Making of brushes; (23) Pea-picking; (24) Feather sorting; (25) Carding, boxing, or packeting of buttons, hooks and eyes, pins, and hair pins; (26) Making of stuffed toys; (27) Making of baskets; (28) Manufacture of chocolates or sweets; (29) The making or filling of cosaques. Christmas crackers, Christmas stockings, or similar articles or parts of articles; (30) The weaving of any textile fabric; (31) And any processes incidental to the above. There are two types of outworker. There are those who take in work not only for themselves but sometimes for the whole family and other individuals. Such a contracting outworker is really then a secondary factory owner and comes under supervision, not only as a person employing outworkers, but also as a factory owner. In this latter capacity the responsibilities of the Council will depend on whether he employs power or not. The other type of outwork is that undertaken by an individual in his own home, and probably a better term here would be "homework". There is little but good to say for such homework. It fulfils a useful function, both for the employer and the worker, and offers some people, especially the housewife with one child, the disabled and the elderly, a chance to add to the family income and increase domestic comfort whilst working at times convenient to the out-worker. Weekly earnings vary according to the ability of the worker and the time that can be spared for the work. There has been no evidence of overcrowding, and the conditions of the homes appear to depend not on whether the women do homework but on whether they are good housewives. 46 During 1956 no less than 836 people were on the register, employed in the following trades:- Wearing apparel 540 Household linen 21 Lace, lace curtains and nets 2 Curtains and furniture hangings 12 Furniture and upholstery 10 Fur pulling 27 Artificial flowers 40 The making of boxes or other receptacles or parts thereof made wholly or partially of paper 32 Brush making 4 Feather sorting 31 Carding of buttons 7 Toy making 21 Basket making 15 Cosaques, Christmas crackers, Christmas stockings, etc. 45 Lampshades 29 The number employed in the Borough during each year since 1950 was as follows:- Year Number 1950 664 1951 573 1952 723 1953 766 1954 760 1955 811 The following table shows the number of visits paid in 1956 and each year for the previous six years and a resume of the action taken. Year Visits DEFAULTS * Failure to supply list Ã¸ Premises in an unwholesome condition 1950 1,750 4 10 1951 1,601 12 11 1952 2,008 12 45 1953 2,136 13 20 1954 1,766 15 12 1955 1,618 12 17 1956 1,762 9 7 * In these cases the lists were forthcoming after a letter from the Department. Ã¸ In each case the factory concerned was notified that the sending of work to the premises must cease, and the outworker was told by letter that this action was being taken owing to the unwholesome conditions under which he or she was working. 47 BASEMENT BAKEHOUSES Only two such bakehouses remained in operation at the end of 1956. Four years is allowed in one case in which to cease baking. The certificate of suitability continues to operate in the case of the other, subject to certain improvements being carried out to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of health. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 This Act requires (a) the registration of premises where specified filling materials are used, and (b) the annual licensing of premises where rag flock is manufactured or stored. Twenty-eight premises were on the Council's register at the end of the year, and two licences were renewed in respect of storage for the year 1957. During 1956 the Council's Public Health Inspectors paid 20 visits to these premises and took 10 samples, as follows, all of which were subjected to the tests prescribed by the Regulations and found to be satisfactory:- Washed layered flock 1 Black Algerian fibre 1 White Cotton felt 2 Washed flock - loose 1 New curled hair and curled fibre mixture (loose) 1 Felt pads 1 New curled hair (loose) 1 Millfly No.8 stock 1 Re-cleansed and dyed black hair 1 LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1953 Trade Effluent to Sewers Six samples of trade effluent were taken during the year and submitted to the Public Analyst for examination. Reports were forwarded to the Borough Engineer. Four were satisfactory but in two cases the matter was reported as likely to interfere with the free flow of the contents of the sewer. 48 SECTION 6 Inspection and Supervision of Food Particulars of the inspections carried out by the Council's Food Inspectors during 1956 are given in the following table:- Number of visits to - Milk distributors 477 Ice cream premises 347 Slaughterhouses 8 Butchers' shops 792 Prepared meat premises 376 Fishmongers' shops 197 Fried fish shops 131 Fish curers' premises 46 Other premises where food and drugs are sold 1,497 Catering establishments 919 Market streets and places 633 Railway goods yards, warehouses 92 Attendances at Police Court 2 Re-inspection after Intimation Notices 247 Other visits 810 Total 6,574* * These visits do not include visits made for the purpose of taking samples.
