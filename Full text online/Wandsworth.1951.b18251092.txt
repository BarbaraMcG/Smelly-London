AC 4388 WAN 88 Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the Year 1951 by F. G. CALEY, M.A., M.B., B.Ch., D.P.H., together with the Report of the Public Analyst. WAN 88 REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1951 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have to report that during the year the health of the Borough has been satisfactory and there has been no unusual or excessive mortality. The birth rate was 13.7, slightly less than in 1950 and compares with 17.8 for the rest of London. The death rate was 12.85 and is slightly higher than in the previous year due to some increase in deaths from influenza and respiratory diseases. The rate for the whole of London was 13.1. There were no deaths from scarlet fever or diphtheria and none of the reported cases of diphtheria were confirmed. The number of cases of measles notified was 4,299, an increase on recent years, but only four deaths were reported. 984 cases of whooping cough were notified with two deaths. Eleven cases of acute poliomyelitis were confirmed during the year. There were no deaths. In 1950 there were 40 cases and seven deaths. There has been a gratifying fall in the number of deaths from tuberculosis from 146 to 107, with reduction in the rate from .44 to .32. The infantile mortality was 23 per 1,000 births compared with an average of 33 for the last ten years. There were three maternal deaths. This summary of the health of the Borough in 1951 is written several months after my retirement and I would like to wish success for future years to the Council, Dr. J. T. Lewis and the Department. Your obedient servant, F. G. CALEY. 19th June, 1952. 2 Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1951 STAFF Numerous staff changes occurred during the year. The vacancy on the establishment of Sanitary Inspectors at the beginning of the year was filled by the appointment of Mr. J. T. Dallimore who commenced duty on 1st January. Two further vacancies for Sanitary Inspectors were created by the resignations in November and December of Mr. F. Evans and Mr. J. Smith. One of these vacancies was filled by the appointment of Mr. J. T. Miles, who, however, was not due to commence duty until 4th February, 1952. The following changes occurred on the Clerical Establishment: Miss H. Lamboll, aged 55 years, died in April after an illness of three months. Mr. W. Pitman was promoted to the Clerical Division, and the consequent vacancy on the General Division filled by the appointment of Mr. D. Barnes. Miss N. North, shorthand-typist, resigned in September and Miss E. Douglass was appointed in her place. On the staff of the Disinfecting Station also there were certain changes during the year. The death occurred suddenly in July of Mr. R. E. Gale, aged 48 years, after 23 years' service with the Council, and subsequently the position of Engineer in charge was filled by the appointment of Mr. F. Stennings. Messrs. A. Batten and E. G. Price, unestablished disinfector apparatus attendants, were placed on the permanent establishment in November, and the first named subsequently appointed to the post of Assistant Supervisor. In December Mrs. C. Mew, part-time Bathing Attendant, resigned. 3 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS Area 9,199 acres Resident population in 1951 332,300 Wandsworth is the largest of the Metropolitan Boroughs.

Dustbin Accommodation—Section 105, Public Health (London) Act, 1936 During the year action was taken under Section 105 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, in respect of 301 premises, and 255 dustbins were provided. In three cases appeals were made by the owners to the London County Council. The appeals were not allowed. Rodent Control Energetic measures for rodent control continued throughout the year, the system followed being that of prebaiting laid down by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. 2,182 rat and mice complaints were received during the year. Following is a summary of the work of the rodent operatives. No. of operatives' visits to premises 12,460 ,, ,, premises prebaited and treated with poison 1,309 ,, ,, premises prebaited and found not troubled 318 ,, ,, premises investigated and found not troubled 304 ,, ,, prebaits laid 37,905 ,, ,, poison baits laid 9,576 ,, ,, drains tested by Sanitary Inspector 357 ,, ,, drains found defective 191 ,, ,, rats estimated killed 10,505 There were eight rodent operatives and one clerk engaged on rodent control duties during the year under the supervision of a Sanitary Inspector. 20 Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1951 Swimming Baths and Bathing Pools There are four public swimming bath establishments and one open air swimming pool belonging to the Council, one open air swimming bath owned by the London County Council, one public swimming pool privately owned, and a number of private bathing pools in the Borough. The Queensmere pond on Wimbledon Common has also for many years past been a recognised bathing pond. In four of the Borough Council's swimming baths, the water is purified by a process of continuous circulation through a filtration plant whereby the whole of the water is dealt with every three to four hours and chlorinated automatically during its circulation from the filtration plant to the bath. In the other bath belonging to the Council, each bath is emptied of water as often as necessary and refilled with fresh water which is continuously circulated and chlorinated automatically the whole time the bath is in use. Certificates Issued in Respect of Rag Washing and Sterilisation At two factories in the Borough, rags are washed and disinfected under the supervision of the Council's Inspector, and certificates are issued for which a charge is made. During 1951, 137 certificates were issued and the amount collected was £41.4.0. Removal to suitable premises of persons in need of care and attention.—National Assistance Act, 1948. Section 47 During the year it was found necessary to take court action under the above Act in one case only, that of an old lady, aged 74 years, who was living alone in a self-contained flat under insanitary conditions and physically incapacitated and unable to devote to herself proper care and attention. A court order was granted for a period of three months and the old lady was removed to a home under the control of the London County Council. 21 Sanitary Inspection of the Borough Eradiction of Bed Bugs The methods employed for freeing infested houses include the stripping of all paper from the walls, the removal of wooden mouldings and skirtings and application of a blow lamp to the room surfaces. Sulphur and "Cimex" candles are often used by house owners and the spraying of rooms by the disinfecting staff of the Council is carried out, proprietory insecticides being used. Infested bedding is removed to the Disinfecting Station and treated by steam. During the year 253 houses were found to be infested with bed bugs and disinfestation was carried out in all cases. Special steps are taken to ensure that the furniture and clothing of families about to be accommodated in the Council's houses or flats are freed from vermin. Hydrogen cyanide gas is used for the disinfestation of the furniture, which is placed in special vans constructed for the purpose, the process being carried out by a contractor. Bedding is not subjected to hydrogen cyanide but is disenfested by steam at the Council's Disinfecting Station. Mortuary and Crematorium TheMortuary at Wandsworth was used throughout the year and 340 bodies were received there. Under the Crematorium Regulations, 1930, 1,243 cremations were authorised during 1951 as compared with 968 in 1950. 22 Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1951 HOUSING Statistics Relating to Housing Public Health Act No. of houses inspected on account of complaints or illness 11,013 Re-inspections 37,622 Number of statutory notices served: Intimation notices 4,373 Nuisance notices 1,247 Number of houses repaired or nuisances remedied 4,930 Housing Act, 1936 Number of houses inspected—house to house (Housing Consolidated Regs. 1925) nil.

In two cases the applicants were not eligible, and in four cases certificates were not granted. 24 Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1951 Clearance of Insanitary Houses On 23rd January, 1951, the St. Alphonsus Road Area, represented by me in the previous year, was declared a Clearance Area in accordance with Section 25 of the Housing Act, 1836 as amended by the Housing Act, 1949. Closing Orders were made during the year on basement premises at 19, Angles Road, 342, Streatham High Road, and 7, Hyacinth Road. The customary notice was served on the owner of the basement premises of 39, Victoria Drive, after I had made official representation. The basement premises of 43, Mount Ephraim Road, on which the Council made a Closing Order on 27th June, 1950, were found to have been re-occupied in contravention of the order, and the Town Clerk was instructed to institute proceedings, if necessary, against the owner. Demolition Orders were made on 11 and 13, Willard Street. The Council also approved an application to use for food storage the converted premises of 3, Aldis Mews, on which a Closing Order was made in 1935 when they were occupied for human habitation. 25 FOOD AND FOOD PREMISES There are four Inspectors engaged in the supervision of the food supply. One of them is the Food and Drugs Inspector of the Borough who is occupied in procuring samples of food and drugs for analysis by the Public Analyst and the Public Health Laboratory and the supervision of dairy premises. The other three Inspectors, are designated Food Inspectors and supervise all other premises where food is sold, stored, manufactured or prepared for sale. One third of the Borough is allocated to each Inspector. The three Inspectors also carry out the duties required under the Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933, and the Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941. With the object of ensuring that all food businesses are supervised systematically, a register of all premises where a food business is carried on has been compiled and is kept up-to-date. This Register includes not only those premises which are subject to some form of legal control, but also all other premises in which a food business of ?.ny description is carried on. The total number of food premises on the register in the Borough is 2,685 and during 1951 they were visited on 37,087 occasions. Table IX has been drawn up to show the number of visits to various food premises in different^ parts of the Borough. Milk Supply The Milk and Dairies Regulations. 1949 These Regulations came into force on 1st October, 1949, and require local authorities to keep a register of all persons carrying on the trade of distributor in their district and of all premises within their district which are used as dairies, not being dairy farms. During the year 21 applications have been received from persons to be registered as distributors of milk. In each case the certificate of registration was granted. Seventeen notices of cancellation of registration have been received. At the end of the year there were 194 persons on the register, including 18 persons with premises outside the Borough. Two applications for registration of premises as dairies and one notice of cancellation of registration were received during the year. There were 31 dairies on the register at the end of the year. The bulk of the milk sold by retail within the Borough is sent out in bottles filled in properly constructed dairies and its quality is good. 26 Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1951 TABLE IX.—Summary of visits by Food Inspectors Putney Thamesfield Fairfield West Hill Southfield Earlsfield d Springfield Tooting Gravency Bedford Larkhall Clapham North Clapham Park Thornton Balham Streatham Hill St. Leonards Streathan Common Streatham South Furzi down hole Borough Dairies and Shops distributing Milk 8 128 75 32 79 83 52 108 119 25 107 104 112 82 104 75 52 115 9 45 1514 Restaurant Kitchens 63 74 105 40 30 53 15 79 86 19 81 114 88 70 73 40 138 16 14 20 1218 Ice Cream Premises 71 129 98 36 65 35 31 85 160 25 104 131 69 140 105 66 182 41 37 55 1665 Butchers' Shops. 242 252 238 78 173 186 39 122 302 61 194 152 98 250 118 117 320 39 54 133 3168 Greengrocers' Shops 35 42 41 54 12 19 26 45 210 35 90 68 17 133 176 27 56 16 45 44 1191 Fishmonsers' Shops 27 59 29 38 26 34 30 63 56 9 64 52 20 87 79 25 88 15 32 33 866 Fried Fish shops 5 25 14 3 33 7 15 5 45 4 69 43 — 15 2 4 3 9 17 53 371 Market Stalls 300 1035 330 410 442 239 640 1444 7131 — 65 571 68 6372 502 — 1213 — — 198 20960 Other Premises 265 380 678 104 349 310 152 293 523 62 363 368 162 525 349 239 440 113 155 260 6091 Slaughterhouses ... 4 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 39 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 43 Total Inspections 1016 2128 1608 795 1209 966 1000 2244 8632 240 1176 1603 634 7674 1508 593 2492 364 364 841 37087 Smoke 4 3 3 4 1 22 25 ... 4 ... ... 4 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 70 Piggeries ... 15 ... 13 ... 12 2 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 2 ... ... ... 45 Bakehouses 20 13 15 ... 23 14 11 2 9 4 33 14 4 5 12 9 14 1 5 8 216 27 Food and Food Premises Food and Drugs Act, 1938 742 samples of milk were submitted for analysis. 740 of these were reported as genuine; 22 of which were samples of Channel Island and South Devon milks with an average fat content of 4.26 per cent. The remaining 718 genuine samples had an average fat content of 3.60 per cent. The Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949-50, and The Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949-50 The regulations came into force on 1st October, 1949, and replace The Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1936 to 1948. They provide for the issue of licences to persons who sell milk under any of the following designations: " Accredited," " Pasteurised," " Sterilised," " Tuberculin Tested." The following licences for the sale of milk under these designations were granted during the year: Accredited nil. Pasteurised 192 Sterilised 249 Tuberculin Tested 141 Total 582 A person who holds a " Tuberculin Tested " licence and a " Pasteurised " or " Sterilised " licence may use the designations " Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) " or " Tuberculin Tested (Sterilised) " as the case may be. 432 samples of milk were procured from distributors, schools, hospitals and institutions and were submitted to the phosphatase test, the methylene blue test and the turbidity test. Seven of these failed to comply with the prescribed tests. In addition 14 samples of milk were examined for the presence of tubercle bacilli. In each case negative results were obtained. 28 Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1951 Meat There are 216 butcher's shops in the Borough. The majority are registered under Section 14(1) (b) of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, for the preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, preserved, pickled or pressed foods. 3,168 visits were made to these shops during the year. Slaughter of Animals There are three private slaughter-houses in the Borough and they were visited on 43 occasions during the year. Sixteen carcases of pigs were inspected before and after slaughter. One mesentery and one liver were found to be diseased and were condemned. Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933-1951 Section 3 of this Act provides that no animal shall be slaughtered or stunned in a slaughterhouse or knacker's yard by any person who is not the holder of a licence granted by a local authority and in force under this section. During the year one application from a person desirous of acting as a slaughterman was submitted to the Council and granted. War Time Piggeries There are now 12 war time piggeries in this Borough and they were inspected on 45 occasions. Unsound Food 142 varieties of foodstuffs suspected to be unsound were examined at the request of the owners and afterwards either destroyed or released for animal feeding. The owners were granted a certificate to this effect. 29 Food and Food Premises Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933, and Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941 These Acts provide for the listing with the Local Authority of all persons dealing in poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List.

There are 14 artesian wells in the Borough. The water from seven of these wells is used for drinking and in the manufacture of food. 27 samples of water from 11 of the wells were examined for contamination, the remaining three were not in use pending repairs. Nine were found to be free from pollution and were fit for drinking purposes. The water from the two wells found to be unfit is not used for drinking or food manufacture. The water to a public drinking fountain, which was formerly a spring supply, is now supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board. The Food and Drugs Act, 1938 Registration of Premises Section 14(1) of this Act requires that any premises used or proposed to be used for:— (a) the sale, or the manufacture for the purpose of sale, of ice-cream, or the storage of ice-cream intended for sale; or (b) the preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food; shall be registered by the owner or the occupier thereof with the local authority. During the year 87 applications for registration under the provisions of Section 14(1) (a) and 18 applications for registration under the provisions of Section 14(1) (b) were submitted to the Council. In all cases the premises were found to be satisfactory and the registration granted. 31 Food and Food Premises Section 57(1) (a) of this Act requires that it shall not be lawful:— for the occupier of any premises to use them as a slaughterhouse or knacker's yard or permit them to be so used, unless he holds a licence granted under this section by the local authority authorising him to keep those premises as a slaughter-house or, as the case may be, as a knacker's yard. During the year three applications for the renewal of licences to use premises as slaughter-houses were submitted to the Council and granted. Bacteriological Analysis of lee-Cream During the year 174 samples of ice-cream were tested in accordance with the technique suggested by the Ministry of Health and Public Health Laboratory Service in their Bulletin of March, 1947. The following table gives a summary of the results:— TABLE XI. Methylene Blue Test. Coliform Test. Provisional Grade No. of Samples Coliform in l/10th ml. (non-faecal) No. of Samples 1 57 Bacillus coli—absent 69 2 10 ,, —present 17 3 13 4 5 Faecal coli—present 1 Total 85 Total 87 Two samples were submitted to the Methylene Blue Test, which was nullified due to interference of colouring matter. In addition one sample of ice lollies was examined following two cases of dysentery. No pathogenic organisms were isolated. 32 Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1951 Analysis of Food and Drugs 1,874 samples of foods and drugs were procured for analysis during the year. 742 samples of milk, 916 other foodstuffs and 216 drugs. Of these 680 were submitted as formal samples while 1,194 were purchased informally. Two or 0.3 per cent, of the formal samples and 28 or 2.3 per cent, of the informal samples were found to be adulterated or not up to standard. The total adulterations reported were 30 or 1.6 per cent, of the samples submitted. The 30 samples found to be adulterated were:— five samples of canned cherries, two of tincture of iodine, two of milk, two of sherbet, two of fruit preserving tablets, two of pork sausages, three of ice-cream, one each of horseradish sauce, French capers, Sweetphat, tartaric acid, sliced bread, boracic ointment, chocolate sweets, meat, sandwich biscuits, Quaker Oats, wafer biscuits and canned tomato soup. Police Court Proceedings It was not necessary to take Police Court proceedings in any of the above cases of adulterated samples, but proceedings under Section 13 of the above Act were taken in respect of a shop where food intended for sale was prepared or stored and which did not comply with the statutory requirements. The Court fined the defendant £3 and ordered him to pay £4 4s. costs. 33 FOOD STANDARDS (GENERAL PROVISIONS) ORDER. 1944 Cream The Food Standards (Cream) Order, 1951,, prescribes the following standards for cream:— Single cream 18 per cent. milk fat Sterilised cream 23 ,. „ ,, ,, Double cream 48 „ ,, ,, ,, Clotted cream 48 ,, „ ,, ,, Two samples of single cream, one of sterilised cream and four of double cream were examined and were found to comply with the above standard. Ice-cream The Food Standards (Ice-cream) Order, 1951, prescribes the following standard for ice-cream:— 5 per cent. of fat 10 per cent. of sugar 7½ per cent. of milk solids other than fat Thirty-four samples of ice-cream were examined for each of these constituents. Three samples were found to be below the required standard, two being deficient in sugar and one being deficient in fat. SPECIAL ANALYSIS A sample of fish cakes and frying fat was examined after a case of suspected food poisoning. No organisms likely to be responsible for food poisoning were isolated. Four samples of synthetic cream, together with two containers in which the cream is despatched, were taken from a factory in this Borough. Bacillus coli was not found and cultures remained sterile in each case. One sample of synthetic cream was examined following cases of para-typhoid in another Borough. All cultures remained sterile. Four samples of synthetic cream were taken from a firm packing the cream for sale by retail. Coliform organisms were found to be present in one of the four samples. Three samples of synthetic cream were obtained from retailers in the Borough. Pathogenic organisms were not isolated in the samples. Five samples of luncheon meat were submitted to a bacteriological examination following a question as to their fitness for sale. In each case they were found to be fit for sale. One sample of tinned crab-meat was submitted for examination following a case of food poisoning. Organisms found suggested that the tin was not quite sterile as regards its contents. 34 FACTORIES ACT, 1937 Prescribed particulars required by Section 128 Part I.—(1) Inspections.

In doing so, I deeply regret that the signature of Mr. A. H. M. Muter, F.R.I.C., F.C.S., the Public Analyst, will not be found at the conclusion of the report, as he died in February. He had almost completed 40 years of service in that capacity, though his connection with the Council was even longer as he was Deputy Analyst for Dr. John Muter for some years. It is interesting to recall that Dr. Muter became Public Analyst to the Wandsworth Board of Work in January 1873. Thus father and son were Public Analysts to the people of Wandsworth for a contiguous period of more than 79 years. I was appointed Deputy Public Analyst by the Council in 1941, and I have continued to act in this capacity during the year under review. By virtue of the requirements of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, I have to report that 1,874 samples were examined under the Act during the year ended 31st December, 1951, 1,658 and 216 drugs. All were submitted by your Council's Food Inspector, 680 having been taken with the formalities required by the Act and 1,194 informally. Samples of the following substances were analysed: bacon 17 samples; beverages (cocoa, coffee, etc.) 47; biscuits 39; butter 31; cereals 78; cheese 33; cooking fat 29; fish, canned, 18; fruit, canned, 28; ice-cream 34; jam and marmalade 22; margarine 30; meat products 31; milk 742; pickles and sauces 25; soup, canned, 33; spices and condiments 24; sugar 30; tea 29; vegetables, canned, 53; aspirin tablets 45; iodine solutions 29; laxative oils 40; ointments 53. 37 Report of the Public Analyst Adulterated Samples Particulars of the samples reported as adulterated are given in the following table:— Case No. Nature of sample Nature of Report Formal 54 Milk 2% extraneous water. 584 Milk 5% deficient in milk fat.

Adulteration The amount of adulteration detected during the year was:— For formal samples 0.3 per cent. For informal samples ... 2.3 per cent. For all samples ... 1.6 per cent. 38 Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1951 Complaint Samples Case No. 1420. Sliced Bread. Small pieces of material adhering to the surface of the slice of bread were found to consist of wood. The complaint was therefore considered justified. Case No. 1607. Canned Cherries. The cherries had been strongly dyed and the dye had stained the lacquer of the tin. The cherries themselves possessed an unpleasant flavour. The complaint was considered justified. (^ases Nos. 1670 Potatoes. These samples were suspected to have and 1671. caused sickness. No. 1670 was a sample of cooked potatoes and No. 1671 was a sample of raw potatoes. No substance was detected which might have caused sickness. It is possible for new potatoes, sold while immature, to cause sickness. Case No. 1679. Canned Plums. The plums examined were of excellent quality. They did not resemble, except in size, the plums complained of which were green and unpalatable. The complaint was considered not justified. Case No. 1746. Chocolate Sweets. These sweets contained a purple dye which was not evenly distributed throughout the mixture. More care should have been exercised in triturating the dyestuff used before incorporating with the other materials. The complaint was considered justified. Case No. 1770. Pork Sausages. The complainant alleged that the sausages were deficient in meat. The meat content was 56.0 per cent, and the sample was therefore 9 per cent, deficient in meat. The complaint was considered justified. Case No. 1777. (Cooked1 Meat. This sample was partly covered with a red colouring matter. The colour was due to the meat being partly immersed in a dilute solution of cochineal colouring. 39 Report of the Public Analyst Case No. 1784. Sweet Biscuits. The filling from the biscuits had a strong taste similar to coconut oil and left an unpleasant taste on the palate. The fat was rancid. The complaint was considered justified. Case No. 1861. Canned Processed Peas. A complaint had been made of the colouring matter used. The sample was found to be quite satisfactory and the complaint considered not justified. Case No. 1866. Canned Garden Peas. The complaint in this case was of foreign matter, stalks, pods, etc., present with the peas. The sample was found to be satisfactory and the complaint considered not justified. Case No. 50. Butter. This butter was complained of on account of its taste. The sample gave analytical figures showing the characteristics of genuine butter. There was no trace of rancidity nor of any flavour not that of butter. It was somewhat more salty than usual, but not enough to cause a complaint. The complaint was considered not justified. Case No. 74. Quaker Oats. This sample was contaminated with paraffin. The contamination may have occurred before or after purchase. There were also a few living mites present. Case No. 75. Sandwich Biscuits. The extracted fat from the biscuit filling has given an acid value which is much too high for an edible fat. The fat used was coconut oil, the fatty acids from which are much more unpleasant than those derived from other edible oils. The complaint was considered justified. Cases Nos. 127 Canned Gooseberries and Canned Strawberries, and 128. These samples were examined as a possible cause of sickness due to metallic contamination of the contents. Both samples were found to be free from metallic contamination and the complaint considered not justified. Case No. 135. Canned Cherries. These cherries had been prepared by bleaching the fruit and subsequently dyeing. The bleaching agent had not been removed completely before dyeing. As a result a residual amount had remained and resulted in disagreeably smelling compounds. The complaint was considered justified. 40 Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1951 Cases Nos. 276, Canned Cherries. Sample No. 276 was punc277 and 278. tured at the seam and there was no pressure of gas in the tin. Samples Nos. 277 and 278 were " blown " and both contained hydrogen. All the samples gave good tests for iron, all the cherries leaving an astringent after-taste. Examination of the lacquer showed that the coating had been attacked at several points, probably due to lack of flexibility of the varnish lacquer used. The cherries were unfit for use and the complaint justified.
