Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1963, upon the Sanitary Circumstances, Sanitary Administration, and Vital Statistics of the Borough. Copies of the Report dating back to 1893 exist in the Health Department and form an interesting record of progress throughout the period. It is a matter of sincere regret that my appointment as your Medical Officer is to come to an end, and that this is the last Report to be presented before London Government Reorganization comes into operation. I am indebted to Mr. W. L. Leach, Chief Public Health Inspector, for his Report on the Sanitary Circumstances of the Area, and to Mr. J. A. Brown for compiling the tables of Vital Statistics. As usual I have received complete co'operation from my colleagues in all other Departments, and I wish to express my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their support at all times, and to every member of the Health Department for their loyalty, hard work and co'operation. I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, ERIC PEREIRA, Medical Officer of Health. 5 PREFACE STAFF Mr. R. J. Hamilton, District Public Health Inspector, resigned his appointment on the 5th April to take up an appointment with the Government of Aden. The vacancy was advertized repeatedly but it had not been possible to fill it by the end of the year. SECTION 'A'— SUMMARY OF STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS Population. The Registrar-General's estimate of the population in 1963 was 38,700, which may be compared with the 1961 Census figure of 39,057. Births. During the year 570 births were recorded compared with 573 in 1962. Both the infant mortality and the still-birth rates are lower than in the previous year, and are satisfactory when compared with the rates for London and for England and Wales. There were 13 infant deaths of which 9 occurred shortly after birth and were due mainly to prematurity. Deaths. The total number of deaths occuring amongst residents was 541 (245 males and 296 females) compared with 523 in 1962. The death rate, when corrected to allow for the abnormally high proportion of elderly residents, was 11.4 per thousand population which is the same as last year, and compares favourably with other towns. Social Conditions. The Borough of Barnes, in the County of Surrey, is situated on the South Bank of the River Thames between Richmond and Putney. One of the great advantages of the Borough is the fact that open spaces comprise almost half of its area, including Richmond Park, the River Thames, Barnes Common, Sheen Common, and other parks and recreation grounds. The Borough is mainly residential in character with some light industry. 6 SECTION 'B' — GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES IN THE AREA (a) Services Provided by the Surrey County Council. These are organized on a Divisional Basis, the Northern Division comprising the boroughs of Barnes and Richmond. The Medical Officer of Health for the Districts is also the Divisional Medical Officer, and this arrangement assists coordination of the personal health services and environmental health. Administrative, Infant Welfare and School Medical functions are carried out from the following Centres:— Divisional Health Office and Welfare Centre, King's Road, Richmond. Welfare Centre, Essex House, Barnes. Welfare Centre, North Worple Way, Mortlake. Health Visitors are employed and are based at the above centres. District T^urses and Midwives are provided and their main centre in Barnes is the Nurses Home, 31/32, Ranelagh Avenue, Barnes. They work under the direct supervision of the general practitioners. Moral Welfare or the care of unmarried mothers and illegitimate children, is undertaken by an officer based at the Divisional Health Office. A Home Help Service provides for domestic help in the home in cases of home confinement or illness. The service is under the management of the Home Help Supervisor who is based at the Divisional Health Office. An Ambulance Service is provided from the Station in King's Road, Richmond, which operates under the Control Station in Maiden. A Day Nursery for the care of children up to the age of 5 years is located at 45, Castelnau, Barnes. (b) Services Provided by the Regional Hospital Board. Hospitals. The Royal Hospital and Kingston Hospital provide general treatment for both in-patients and out-patients. In addition, many residents make use of the West London Hospital, Hammersmith and other London Hospitals. Patients suffering from infectious diseases are admitted to the South Middlesex Fever Hospital, to Tolworth Isolation Hospital, and to the Western Fever Hospital, Fulham, 7 Psychiatric Services. The Medical Staff of Banstead Hospital hold out-patient clinics at the Royal Hospital on Tuesdays and Fridays for residents of Barnes and Richmond. Diseases of the Chest. A Chest Clinic is run jointly by the Regional Hospital Board and the Surrey County Council, and is located over the Welfare Centre, North Worple Way, Mortlake. Laboratory Facilities. The Laboratory of the Royal Hospital is available for specimens sent in by general practitioners. The Public Health Laboratory, Epsom is available for the examination of samples of milk and ice-cream, and any pathological specimens. The Staff is always available to assist the Medical Officer of Health in the case of epidemics or outbreaks of food poisoning. The Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, is available for advice, special immunising agents and special investigations. Mortuary. This is provided and maintained by Richmond Borough Council on a site close to the Petty Sessions Court. It is well equipped with two post-mortem tables. Barnes Borough Council make an annual payment for this service. (c) Services Provided by the Surrey Executive Council. The Surrey Executive Council provides General Medical and Dental Services, Pharmaceutical Services and Supplementary Ophthalmic Services. More than twenty doctors living within the borough have undertaken to provide General Medical Services. Several of these have also undertaken to provide Maternity Medical Services. Care of the Aged and the Chronic Sick. Responsibility for providing suitable accommodation for the elderly infirm rests with the County Welfare Officer. The Principal Divisional Welfare Officer who has an office at 38 Sheen Road, Richmond, investigates all cases and endeavours to arrange for their admission to homes where appropriate. The waiting list for admision is gradually lengthening and it has become extremely difficult to obtain a vacancy even for urgent cases, 8 The Geriatrician based at Kingston Hospital is responsible for the care of the chronic sick who require admission to hospital. She has the services of a Health Visitor who supervises those awaiting admission, and is in a position to report on improvement or deterioration. A number of chronic sick hospital beds are occupied by elderly patients who have improved with treatment and who could be trans' ferred to welfare accommodation if only places were available. Again, the waiting list for admission is increasing, and although a desperate case is invariably admitted quite quickly, other cases requiring admission must often wait lengthy periods under very difficult conditions. There is a group of elderly patients who form a very real prob' lem. They are old people who suffer from increasing senile mental degeneration. They are confused, often incontinent, unable to do much for themselves, and not amenable to treatment. They are usually ambulant and not suitable for a chronic sick hospital bed. Many such patients occupy welfare accommodation, but generally they have deteriorated since admission some years previously and it has not been possible for them to be transferred elsewhere. The mental Hospitals will not willingly admit such patients since they do not respond to treatment, and also because these hospitals are suffering severly from shortage of staff. There is an urgent need for special accommodation for these patients. Every effort is made to provide assistance through the domicilliary services. A very effective District Nursing Service is maintained, but increasing difficulty is experienced in recruiting suitable women to the Home Help Service since work in light industry is more attractive and quite easy to obtain. Much good work is done by the voluntary services, and full support should be given to any proposed expansion. National Assistance Act, 1948, Section 47. National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, Section l(1). Perhaps one of the most difficult problems is how to deal with old people who are living alone, neglecting themselves and their accommodation, and who resent any interference. Every effort is made to persuade them to accept the services available. When this is successful the old person gradually begins to appreciate the help given, and often begins to improve both physically and mentally. Sometimes the old person refuses all offers of help, and is quite unwilling to enter a Home or Hospital. In these cases it becomes necessary to apply to the Court or to a Magistrate for an Order for the Compulsory Removal of the patient to suitable accommodation. Two such cases occurred during the year. The first was an old lady aged 97 who lived alone in a house which was neglected and dilapidated. She had had the gas supply disconnected, there was no power, and she cooked on an open fire. She refused all assistance. In January 9 the water pipes froze, the house was flooded, and the electric lighting became dangerous. She still refused to leave her house which was now quite uninhabitable, and accordingly application was made to a Magistrate for a Removal Order. She was removed to Kingsmead, where she remained until her death some months later. The second case was that of an old lady, aged 82, who lived alone and who had fallen, injuring her back, and had been unable to get up. She had remained on the floor for some hours, and her general condition was poor. She refused to consider admission to hospital and as it would have been quite unsafe for her to be left alone application was made for a Removal Order. This was granted and she was admitted to Barnes Hospital the same day. Several other similar cases were dealt with, but the patients were finally persuaded to leave their homes and arrangements were made for their admission to suitable accommoda' tion without recourse to compulsion. Laundry Service. The Council acts as an Agent for the County Council in providing this service. It is confined exclusively to patients who are incontinent, and articles laundered are limited to sheets and draw sheets. Although the number of cases served is small, the benefits to exhausted relatives are enormous. It enables them to nurse at home in comfort a patient who otherwise would have had to be admitted to hospital. Sheets are collected from the patients' homes every Tuesday and Friday and at the same time an appropriate number of clean sheets is issued. A charge of sixpence per sheet is made, which is no hardship, since the cost is covered by a supplementary allowance where patients are in receipt of National Assistance. SECTION 'F — PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Dysentery. In the autumn of 1962 there were outbreaks of a mild form of dysentery due to Shigella sonnei, mainly affecting two local primary schools. These outbreaks threw a great deal of work on the Public Health Inspectors and were only controlled after a prolonged period. The 43 cases notified by General Practitioners in 1963 all originated from the outbreaks which commenced in the previous year. There is no doubt that the spread of this disease in schools is greatly influenced by the possibility or otherwise of a strict handwashing routine by pupils after using the toilet and before taking a 10 meal. One of the schools affected was an old building where the sanitary conveniences are situated in the play-ground, far detached from the washing facilities which are located in the main building. Under these circumstances it is impossible for the staff to enforce a strict routine and the arrangement tends to discourage cleanly habits rather than otherwise. The other school was of modern construction but the limited toilet accommodation and the ungenerous supply of towels placed a heavy burden on the staff who made every endeavour to enforce a strict routine. There is no doubt that the older schools should be replaced as soon as possible or at least all outside toilets should be scrapped and replaced by proper sanitary accommodation forming part of the main building. Further, any new schools should be provided with toilets, wash-hand basins and hand towels on a more generous scale and designed to encourage children to adopt cleanly habits. It is to be hoped that with the more compact local administration of the new London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, such matters as these will receive the attention they deserve. Food Poisoning. Three suspected cases of food poisoning were notified by General Practitioners and one case was otherwise ascertained. The cases were entirely unrelated. All had symptoms suggesting food infection but all investigations were negative and the causal organism was not established in any case. Measles. The expected epidemic of Measles occurred and 385 cases were notified by General Practitioners. All made good recoveries. Control of Typhoid Fever. An Austrian Alpine Expedition for senior scouts left England for Austria on the 12th August and returned on the 24th August, 1963. On the 12th September information was received that a scout of one contingent was suffering from Typhoid Fever, and that another was seriously ill and a suspected case. Fifteen members of the Expedition resided in Barnes and arrangements were made for all to be visited and for faecal specimens to be obtained to endeavour to establish whether or not any were infected. One of the contacts became ill and was thought to be a possible case; however all were finally proved negative and no further cases occurred. IMMUNISATION AND VACCINATION The scheme for immunising children against Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Tetanus and Poliomyelitis, continued as in previous years 11 and the response from parents was very good. Reference to the tables in Section 'F' will shown how these schemes are progressing. Smallpox. The Minister of Health advised that the safest time for primary vaccination was in the second year of life rather than in the early months. The adoption of this policy reduced the number of vaccinations carried out during the year, but it is hoped that the response will be satisfactory when children are called to the clinic at the appropriate age. Poliomyelitis. Only the oral vaccine is now in use. It is well received by the infants and children and no serious reactions to it have been observed. The usual protective course consists of three doses at monthly intervals, and children entering school are given a fourth dose as an extra precaution. I am pleased to report that no case of poliomyelitis occurred in the borough during the year. Tetanus. It has become routine now for all infants to be protected by a 'Triple' Antigen which gives protection against Diphtheria, Whooping Cough and Tetanus. In addition parents of older children are readily accepting immunisation against Tetanus separately. The chief advantage is that if an immunised child suffers an injury that could lead to Tetanus, it is sufficient to give a booster dose of Tetanus Antigen instead of anti-tetanic serum which, at times, causes dangerous reactions. Prevention of Tuberculosis. As in previous years all children aged 13 years were offered B.C.G. vaccination. The object is to provide artificial immunity to the disease during the adolescent period when children are susceptible and can be seriously affected. During 1963 a total of 430 boys and girls were inoculated with B.C.G. Mobile Radiography Unit. The Mobile Chest Radiography service for general practitioners has proved to be a great convenience to the local doctors and their patients and good use has been made of the service. The Unit operates outside the Municipal Offices every Monday evening from 5.45 p.m. to 6.45 p.m. Patients are X-Rayed expeditiously and the Unit can readily cover the demand. 12 Prospective Council employees who have not proof of recent Chest X-Ray are referred to the Unit, and the report can be of considerable help in assessing their fitness for employment. During the year 19 employees were examined prior to inclusion in Sickness and Superannuation Schemes. In addition, the Unit is available to members of the public who can visit during the time stated without any prior appointment. 13 THE REPORT OF THE CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR Mr. W. L. LEACH, IS CONTAINED IN THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS 'C, 'D' and 'E'. SECTION 'C' —SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA WATER SUPPLY. The domestic water supply is derived from the River Thames, is stored in the Board's reservoirs at Staines, Littleton and Walton, and filtered and chlorinated at the Hampton Works before being passed into the trunk mains for public supply. The water is of a splendid quality and adequate in quantity throughout the year. No new sources of supply were instituted and there were no substantial alterations to trunk or service mains. The Board's waters are not plumbo-solvent. Immediate action is taken in respect of any form of contamination, or variation in quality should it be found necessary. We are indebted to Dr. Windle Taylor, Director of Water Examination, to the Board, for this information and for the statistical data in Table 14. As far as is known, every dwelling has a piped water supply from the public mains. Not every household has the exclusive use of a piped water supply from a tap inside the dwelling, and taken direct from the mains, which is most desirable for drinking water. Many households occupying sub-let portions of houses, have to take water from taps in bathrooms etc. where the supply is fed from a storage cistern. These storage cisterns are seldom checked by the occupiers and are quite often found to be in need of cleansing and covering. SWIMMING POOLS All the 8 routine samples of swimming bath water taken from the learners' pool at Sheen Mount County Primary School proved satisfactory. There are no public swimming pools within the borough. SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL Special investigations were carried out by the Borough Engineer and Surveyor into the condition of certain main sewers. In particular the Sheen Lane sewer was found to be in seriously defective condition and inadequate for present day needs. The task of relaying this sewer will present many problems and cause serious dislocation but it is something which must be undertaken before worse trouble develops. At the time of writing a good start has been made and work is proceeding satisfactorily. 14 Some of the complaints referred to in previous Annual Reports of smell, flies and flying insects from the Richmond Main Sewage Works were repeated during the summer months of 1963. Energetic measures were taken by the Board's staff to deal with these complaints which are unfortunately a recognised hazard where sewage works are situated in a built up residential area. It is disconcerting to note that pressure of demands for new housing has led to the development of land in the near vicinity of the Works, even by our own Authority. It is too optimistic to expect even a modern sewage works to operate continuously without ever causing a nuisance in the immediate neigh' bourhood. VERMINOUS PREMISES ETC. Rodent Control. Routine treatment of the sewers against rats was continued over small areas of the sewers system. The results proved very satisfactory and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have advised that only check treatments are considered necessary in future. No serious surface infestation by rats or mice have been reported. The number of isolated complaints remains at a satisfactory low level. Other Pests. Less than ten verminous premises were noted during the year. The relative ease with which householders can deal with such infestations by the use of preparations of D.D.T. etc., readily available in the shops, makes this aspect of our work very light nowadays. There were, however, more requests for the eradication of wasps nests, although these too can, and should, be dealt with by the prudent amateur. Refuse Collection and Disposal. The Refuse Transfer Station came into operation on 1st May, 1963. In many respects the changeover from incineration has resulted in a simpler, cleaner and more straightforward system. As with any system of waste disposal, hold-ups must be kept to a minimum, otherwise chaos and the most unpleasant consequences follow. The most serious drawback to the new system lies in the necessity to have an adequate reserve of mechanical transport available to deal with breakdowns and abnormalities. By its nature domestic refuse cannot be stored for long in a residential area. Much of the refuse has already been in the householder's bin for several days and on arrival at the Transfer Station conditions for fly breeding and nuisance from putrescible matter are such that it is imperative that the transfer to the controlled tips is continuous and expeditious. A few complaints 15 were received about the conditions under which the large transporter vehicles carried refuse to tips outside the area, but prompt action was taken to remedy the causes of complaint. No change was made during the year to the method of collection of refuse from domestic or trade premises. With the introduction of Smoke Control Areas problems have arisen in connection with the disposal of such awkward parcels as surgical dressings and the debris from maternity and home nursing cases. Where other disposal methods have proved unsatisfactory the Department has carried out a limited collection service with disposal via the Refuse Transfer Station. This is a growing problem and the present arrangements are only experimental. It is the sort of service which arises from small emergency beginnings but which comes to be regarded as a matter of right by those whom we assist. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION Smoke Control Areas. The Barnes (No. 3) Smoke Control Order came into operation on 1st January, 1963. The exceptionally severe winter brought many problems which seriously hampered the completion of conversion works, and some latitude was, of necessity, allowed in respect of late applications for grant. There was a marked increase in the number of householders who elected to change to gas or electric room heating. Difficulty was again experienced in agreeing estimates for conversion work on account of the very high prices charged locally for building work, as compared with costs in other areas, coupled with the natural desire of householders to secure improvements in their heating arrangements at the same time as necessary conversion work is carried out. Special consideration was again given to pensioners and others who needed extra assistance in having works of conversion carried out, and the Public Health Committee gave increased grants to 11 old age pensioners etc. out of a total of 253 applicants for grants during the year. The Barnes (No. 4) Smoke Control Order was introduced to deal with the small triangle of property in the Putney area and to bring it into line with the Smoke Control Orders made by Wandsworth Borough Council affecting adjoining properties. With the coming into operation of these areas at least half of the Borough has now been dealt with. The survey of the No. 5 Area was carried out before the end of the year on the same basis as before. However, in December, 1963 a statement on Future Fuel Policy was issued by the Ministry of Power. The effect of this statement was to change the emphasis in conversion works, from the provision of modern open fires to the newly developed solid fuel room heaters, gas fires and electrical thermal storage heaters. These appliances are designed to use economically fuel which is 16 expected to be in good supply, during the forseeable future. The use of 'open fire' coke and direct acting electric fires is to be discouraged on account of supply difficulties. Arrangements for the introduction of the No. 5 Smoke Control Area had been completed on the old basis, but, in confirming the Order, the Minister of Housing and Local Government requested that the new arrangements should apply. This has led to considerable confusion and a great deal of extra work in revising estimates, explaining the new proposals, and revising the scheme of grants. Given time to reflect on the various aspects of home heating most householders welcome the new appliances, except of course, for the heavier costs of installation. Very few contraventions of the Smoke Control Orders have been noted. Informal warnings have been heeded and no formal proceedings were necessary during the year. If the present programme is adhered to the whole of the existing Borough would be declared 'Smokeless' by 1968 (operative from 1969). The results of observations carried out by means of recording apparatus at the Civil Defence Centre show that there has been a significant downward trend in the amount of smoke in the atmosphere of East Sheen. Many people have commented favourably on the cleaner atmosphere in the Barnes area since the introduction of smoke control, but there is now no recording apparatus in that part of the borough. Unfortunately there has only been a very small improvement in the reduction of sulphur dioxide. This is explained of course by the fact that although smokeless fuels are cleaner, they nevertheless still contain almost as much sulphur as the coal they are replacing. It is considered, however, that with the absence of smoke particles, the effect of sulphur pollution is considerably less than when combined with smoke. The number of complaints relating to smoke nuisances caused by the burning of rubbish have increased. It is really surprising to note the selfishness of persons who see nothing wrong in regularly creating smoke to the annoyance and detriment of their immediate neighbours. SECTION 'D' —HOUSING No large scale drive against unsatisfactory housing conditions was mounted during the year. Many of the circumstances which give rise to bad housing conditions are not, in this area, such as can be remedied by the application of the Housing Acts. Property generally is now kept in a reasonable state of repair. There are still, however, many tenanted houses which require to be brought up to modern standards of equipment, but the occupants would not necessarily welcome the intervention of the Local Authority. Compulsory im,- provement schemes will be considered when the Housing Act, 1964 comes into force. The present day cost of building work is so high that tenants fear the inevitable rise in rent which improvements would cause, and we may well have to persuade not only owners but occupiers as well, that bathrooms, hot water and internal water closets are really essential. Apart from the Council's own Mortlake High Street scheme there were no declared improvement areas where old dwellings are swept away to make room for modern houses. Some of the larger old houses, however, with large gardens, attracted the developers. Only one Housing Management Order was made and this was a special case involving unsatisfactory relations between the tenants rather than with the landlord. SECTION 'E' —INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD Regular routine inspections were carried out to all food handling establishments. The frequency of inspection now being maintained, when the establishment of Public Health Inspectors is at full strength, prevents a deterioration in the standard of any particular premises from going unnoticed for long. The provisions of the Food Hygiene Regulations are being well observed by traders in the area, as far as premises and facilities allow. The greatest drawback to the maintenance of good standards of hygiene is still the fact that too often washing facilities are too far away, or are otherwise not conveniently accessible to the place where they are really needed, but consideration of cost and space are formidable obstacles, especially when traders can see no prospect of an immediate cash return. Although the usual number of samples of food were taken for chemical analysis only very minor infringements of the labelling requirements were encountered. .

'Benzoic acid is an added preservative'. 'Pickles are included in the list of specified foods in the Preservatives in Food Regulations, 1962, and are allowed to contain specified maximum quantities of sulphur dioxide or methyl parahydroxybenzoate or propyl parahydroxybenzoate provided a declaration in the prescribed form that the food contains preservative is made on the label. This pickle, however, contains benzoic acid which is not a permitted preservative for this article. 39 The manufacturers of the product were informed of the Analyst's report and that the labelling of their product contravened the Preservatives in Food Regulations, 1962. No further action was taken in respect of this sample. Sample No. 415—Packet of Onion Sauce. 'The ingredients of this article are specified on the label as dry onion, wheat flour, salt, liquid seasoning and hydrolised protein'. 'Liquid seasoning is a generic and not a specific name or description and is not in accordance with the requirements of the Labelling of Food Order, 1953'. No action was taken in respect of this sample. Table 27.—Unsound Food.
